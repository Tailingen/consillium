Dose Escalation Study of Pasireotide (SOM230) in Patients With Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors (NETs)
This study designed to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) for patients with advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors (NETs) and to characterize the safety, tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of pasireotide LAR administered i.m. once every 28 days.
Neuroendocrine Tumors
DRUG: Pasireotide LAR
Determine the MTD/RP2D of pasireotide LAR when administered i.m. q28 days to patients with advanced NETs, Frequency of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) at each dose level associated with q28 days administration of pasireotide LAR during the first 2 treatment cycles., Sequentiona 56 day cohorts until the MTD is determined
assess the safety and tolerability of pasireotide LAR, Incidence of adverse drug events, overall and by severity and incidence of serious adverse events and laboratory abnormalities. Also, changes in laboratory assessments, electrocardiograms, Holter monitor, imaging for gallstones, and assessment of physical examinations such as vital signs, minimum of twelve 28 day cycles to approximately eighteen 28 day cycles|assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of pasireotide LAR, Pasireotide Cmax and Ctrough, minimum of twelve 28 day cycles to approximately eighteen 28 day cycles|assess the pharmacodynamics (PD) of pasireotide LAR, Changes from baseline values in IGF-1, chromogranin A and neuron-specific enolase, minimum of twelve 28 day cycles to approximately eighteen 28 day cycles|assess the preliminary efficacy (anti-tumor activity) of pasireotide LAR., Disease control rate (CR+PR+SD as assessed by RECIST 1.0). Also measure progression free survival (PFS)., minimum of twelve 28 day cycles to approximately eighteen 28 day cycles
This study designed to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) for patients with advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors (NETs) and to characterize the safety, tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of pasireotide LAR administered i.m. once every 28 days.
