The Efficacy and Safety of Apatinib in Heavily Pretreated Advanced Non-squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
The development of anti-angiogenesis drugs has led to renewed enthusiasm in lung cancer treatments. Apatinib, also known as YN968D1, is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor which selectively inhibits the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) and also represents mild inhibition to PDGFR, c-Kit and c-src tyrosine kinases. It is an orally bioavailable, small molecule agent which is thought to inhibit VEGF-mediated endothelial cell migration and proliferation thus blocking blood vessel formation in tumor tissues. Previous studies have identified that apatinib was well tolerated at doses below 750mg daily. In phase I/II study, investigators reported an objective response rate of 68%. In a phase III trial conducted in advanced pretreated gastric cancer, the median overall survival was significantly prolonged in the apatinib group compared with placebo group. Thus, in this trial, the investigators aim to investigate the efficacy and safety of apatinib in previously treated advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer.
