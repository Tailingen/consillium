A Study of Venetoclax and AMG 176 in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Hematologic Malignancies
This dose-escalation study evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of venetoclax in combination with AMG 176 in participants with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and participants with Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL)/diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

This study will include a dose escalation phase to identify the maximum tolerated dose/recommended phase 2 dose (MTD/RPTD) of venetoclax plus AMG 176 as well as a dose expansion phase to confirm safety, explore efficacy, and confirm the suitability of the preliminary RPTD.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia|Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma|Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Venetoclax|DRUG: AMG 176
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and/or Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RPTD) for Venetoclax + AMG 176, The MTD and/or RPTD of venetoclax and of AMG 176 will be determined during the dose escalation phase of the study., Up to 28 days after first dose of study drug in a dose-escalation phase|Number of Participants With Adverse Events, An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment., From first dose of study drug until 30 days or 5 half-lives after discontinuation of study drug administration will be collected (up to approximately 4 years).
Composite Complete Remission Rate (CRc) for Participants with AML, CRc rate is defined as CR + CRi (CR with incomplete blood count recovery)., Up to approximately 2 years from last subject first dose|Objective Response Rate (ORR) for Participants with AML, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with documented partial response (PR) or better (CR + CRi + partial response \[PR\]) based on International Working Group (IWG) criteria for AML, Up to approximately 2 years from last subject first dose|ORR for Participants with NHL, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with documented CR + PR based on Lugano criteria for NHL., Up to approximately 2 years from last subject first dose|Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of Venetoclax, Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) of venetoclax., Up to approximately 28 days after first dose of study drug|Time to Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Tmax) of Venetoclax, Time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) of Venetoclax., Up to approximately 28 days after first dose of study drug|AUC of Venetoclax, Area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of venetoclax., Up to approximately 28 days after first dose of study drug|Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of AMG 176, Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) of AMG 176, Up to approximately 16 days after first dose of study drug|Half-life (t1/2) of AMG 176, Terminal phase elimination half-life (t1/2), Approximately 16 days after first dose of study drug|AUC of AMG 176, Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve (AUC) of AMG 176, Approximately 16 days after first dose of study drug|Clearance (CL) of AMG 176, Clearance (CL) is defined the volume of plasma cleared of the drug per unit time., Approximately 16 days after first dose of study drug
