Adenovirus (RGDCRAdCOX2F)
This is a single center, Phase I dose finding study of a single direct tumor injection of an RGD modified conditionally replicative adenovirus (RGDCRAdcox2F) in persons with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. The study is designed to determine the MTD of RGDCRAdCOX2F that corresponds to the maximum desired toxicity of ≤ 20%.
