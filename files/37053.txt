A Study Evaluating Atezolizumab and Bevacizumab, With or Without Tiragolumab, in Participants With Untreated Locally Advanced or Metastatic Hepatocellular Carcinoma (IMbrave152)
The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of tiragolumab, an anti-TIGIT monoclonal antibody, when administered in combination with atezolizumab and bevacizumab as first-line treatment, in participants with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Carcinoma, Hepatocellular
DRUG: Atezolizumab|DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Tiragolumab|OTHER: Placebo
Investigator-Assessed Progression-Free Survival (PFS) According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, From randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 36 months)|Overall Survival (OS), From randomization to death from any cause (up to approximately 36 months)
Investigator-Assessed Confirmed Objective Response Rate (ORR) According to RECIST v1.1, From randomization up to approximately 36 months|Investigator-Assessed Duration of Objective Response (DOR) According to RECIST v1.1, From the first occurrence of a documented confirmed objective response to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 36 months)|Investigator-Assessed PFS Rate According to RECIST v1.1 at 6 and 12 Months, Month 6, Month 12|OS Rate at 1 and 2 Years, Year 1, Year 2|Investigator-Assessed PFS According to Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) Modified RECIST (mRECIST), From randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 36 months)|Investigator-Assessed Confirmed ORR According to HCC mRECIST, From randomization up to approximately 36 months|Investigator-Assessed DOR According to HCC mRECIST, From the first occurrence of a documented confirmed objective response to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 36 months)|Time to Confirmed Deterioration (TTCD) Assessed Using European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire for Cancer 30 (QLQ-C30) Subscales, The following subscales of the EORTC QLQ-C30 will be used for the assessment: global health status/quality-of-life (GHS/QoL), physical functioning and role functioning. GHS and QoL are scored on a 7-point scale: 1=Very poor to 7=Excellent. Functioning items are scored on a 4-point scale: 1=Not at all to 4=Very much, with a higher score indicating a worse outcome. Scores will be linearly transformed with a minimum score of 0 and maximum score of 100. A higher score indicates a better outcome., From randomization up to approximately 36 months|Change from Baseline in GHS/QoL, Physical Functioning, and Role Functioning Assessed Using the EORTC QLQ-C30, GHS and QoL are scored on a 7-point scale: 1=Very poor to 7=Excellent. Functioning items are scored on a 4-point scale: 1=Not at all to 4=Very much, with a higher score indicating a worse outcome. Scores will be linearly transformed with a minimum score of 0 and maximum score of 100. A higher score indicates a better outcome., From baseline up to approximately 36 months|Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events, Up to approximately 36 months|Serum Concentrations of Atezolizumab, Prior to the first infusion and 30 minutes after atezolizumab infusion on Day 1 of Cycle 1 (cycle = 21 days), prior to infusion on Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 16 and at treatment discontinuation visit (up to approximately 36 months)|Serum Concentrations of Tiragolumab, Prior to the first infusion and 30 minutes after tiragolumab infusion on Day 1 of Cycle 1 (cycle = 21 days), prior to infusion on Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 16 and at treatment discontinuation visit (up to approximately 36 months)|Percentage of Participants With Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADAs) to Tiragolumab, Prior to the first infusion on Day 1 of Cycles (cycle = 21 days) 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 16 and at treatment discontinuation visit (up to approximately 36 months)|Percentage of Participants With Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADAs) to Atezolizumab, Prior to the first infusion on Day 1 of Cycles (cycle = 21 days) 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 16 and at treatment discontinuation visit (up to approximately 36 months)
