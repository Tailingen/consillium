disease-free survival, To compare the 3-year disease-free survival between the investigational arm and the control arm., 3 years
Overall survival, Overall survival will be defined as the time from randomisation to the time of occurrence of the first death regardless to its cause. Patients alive at the time of analysis will be censored at the date of the last follow up., 7 years
Methodology This is a biomedical research, national, multicenter, open-label randomized, 2-arm phase III superiority trial, comparing neoadjuvant CT with mFolfirinox then preoperative CRT, versus immediate preoperative CRT, in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer Randomized Phase III study with stopping rules Stratification : center, gender, tumor location in the rectum (\<6 cm from anal verge versus â‰¥6 cm), initial stage (cT3 vs cT4, and cN0 vs cN+)
