Optimizing the Strategy for Preoperative Chemotherapy in Locally Advanced Gastric/Gastroesophageal Cancer
This is a randomized, phase II, open-label study. The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal treatment for patients with locally advanced Gastric/Gastroesophageal Cancer according to their HER-2 expression status.

The primary endpoint of this study: major pathology response rate the second endpoints of this study: pathology complete response rate R0 resection rate Progression-free survival ( PFS) Disease -free survival (DFS) Overall survival(OS) Objective response rate(ORR) Adverse event(AE)
Gastric Cancer
DRUG: S-1|DRUG: Trastuzumab|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Docetaxel
major Pathological response rate, 40 months
(HER2, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2) positive patients: After 4 cycles of SOX±Trastuzumab neoadjuvant therapy, patients will continue to accept D2 surgery. The patients with R0 resection will continue to receive 4 cycles of SOX±Trastuzumab adjuvant chemotherapy. If the patients are confirmed with tumor progression before surgery, the treatment such as gastrectomy, chemoradiotherapy or second line chemotherapy should be determined by MDT team.

(HER2, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2,HER2) negative patients： After 4 cycles of DOS or SOX regimen as neoadjuvant therapy, patients will continue to accept D2 surgery. The patients with R0 resection will continue to receive then 4 cycles of DOS or SOX adjuvant chemotherapy. If the patients are confirmed with tumor progression before surgery, the treatment such as gastrectomy, chemoradiotherapy or second line chemotherapy should be determined by MDT team.
