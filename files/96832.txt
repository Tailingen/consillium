Efficacy Study of Single Stage Breast Reconstruction in Female Participants With Mastectomy
The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of immediate single-stage post-mastectomy breast reconstruction with Strattice Reconstructive Tissue Matrix (Strattice) as compared to immediate two-stage post-mastectomy breast reconstruction where the initially placed expander was exchanged for a breast implant only, without any type of reinforcement.
Mastectomy and Breast Reconstruction
PROCEDURE: Breast Reconstruction, Direct to Implant (DTI) with Strattice™|PROCEDURE: Two Stage Breast Reconstruction
Mean Number of Planned and Unplanned Post-mastectomy Surgical Interventions Per Participant on the Reconstructed Breast, Within 12 Months of the Initial Study Surgery (ISS), ISS was defined as the DTI breast reconstruction with Strattice™ or the first surgery of the two-stage breast reconstruction. Data is presented for participants with unilateral (one breast) and bilateral (two breast) reconstruction. Postmastectomy surgical interventions on the reconstructed breast were reported for each participant and the total number of planned and unplanned post-mastectomy surgical interventions was averaged in each group., Up to 12 months post ISS
Number of Participants Experiencing One or More Serious Breast Reconstruction-related Complications (BRRC), Serious BRRC were complications that required re-entry of the breast pocket with or without exchange or removal of the implant and any manipulation of the implant pocket including the infra-mammary fold (IMF). Serious BRRC were detected through review by a medical monitor. Surgical complications included: capsular contracture (Baker grade ≥ 3), infection (local or systemic), hematoma, seroma, inflammation, skin or flap necrosis, implant extrusion, malposition, malrotation, asymmetry, bottoming out., Up to 12 months post ISS|Number of Participants Experiencing One or More Serious BRRC Within 24 Months of Post-Permanent Reconstruction (ppR), Serious BRRC were complications that required re-entry of the breast pocket with or without exchange or removal of the implant and any manipulation of the implant pocket including the IMF. Serious BRRC were detected through review by a medical monitor. BRRC were defined as: a) infection, local or systemic, b) hematoma, c) seroma, d) inflammation, e) skin or flap necrosis, f) capsular contraction as defined by Baker grade \> 3, g) implant extrusion (loss or explants), and h) malposition, malrotation, asymmetry, and bottoming out., Up to 24 months ppR|Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Cases of Capsular Contracture as Defined by Baker Grade III or IV Within 24 Months of ppR, The surgeon assessed the level of capsular contracture in the participant's breast using the Baker Breast Contracture Scale where: Grade I=breast is normally soft and looks natural, Grade II=breast is a little firm but looks normal, Grade III=breast is firm and looks abnormal and Grade IV= breast is hard, painful, and looks abnormal. Baker Grade III and IV were defined as clinically significant and are reported here. Data is presented for number of participants with capsular contracture per breast (right breast and left breast)., Up to 24 months ppR|Aesthetic Outcomes of Participants Using Blinded Assessment 2D Photographs by Independent Review Panel, Baseline up to Month 24|Number of Planned and Unplanned Post-mastectomy Surgical Interventions of the Reconstructed Breast Within 6 Months of ISS, ISS was defined as the DTI breast reconstruction with Strattice™ or the first surgery of the two-stage breast reconstruction. Data is presented for participants with unilateral (one breast) and bilateral (two breast) reconstruction. Postmastectomy surgical interventions on the reconstructed breast were reported for each participant and the total number of planned and unplanned post-mastectomy surgical interventions was averaged in each group., Baseline up to 6 months post ISS|Number of Planned and Unplanned Post-mastectomy Surgical Interventions of the Reconstructed Breast, Surgical interventions were all planned and unplanned post-mastectomy surgical interventions per participant on the reconstructed breast, within 24 months of the ISS, which is defined as the DTI breast reconstruction with Strattice™ TM or the first surgery of the two-stage breast reconstruction. Data is presented for participants with unilateral (one breast) and bilateral (two breast) reconstruction., Within 24 months ppR
Health-related Quality of Life, At 3, 6, and 12 months post-mastectomy and at 4 months ppR|Healthcare Resource Use Including Length of Hospital Stay and Clinic Visits, At 6 and 12 months post-mastectomy and at 24 months ppR|Time to Return to Work or Normal Daily Activities, 6 and 12 months post-mastectomy and 24 month ppR
The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of immediate single-stage post-mastectomy breast reconstruction with Strattice™ TM, otherwise referred to as DTI as compared to immediate two-stage post-mastectomy breast reconstruction where the initially placed expander will be exchanged for a breast implant only, without any type of a reinforcement. The objective will be achieved by prospectively assessing the number of planned and unplanned post-mastectomy surgical interventions within 12 months of the mastectomy.

Two-stage breast reconstruction will include the initial placement of a tissue expander in a total or partial submuscular position. In the case of partial muscle coverage, this will be without the support of any mesh or autologous flap to reinforce the lower pole. The expander will be inflated over approximately the next one to six months, and then replaced with an implant.
