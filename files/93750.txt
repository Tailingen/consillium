In this study,the eligible breast cancer patients will be randomized divided into two groups. the study group receive the accelerated hypo-fractioned whole breast irradiation with a concurrent boost to the tumor bed (WBI 2.5Gy x18 and SIB 2.88Gy x18) and the control group receive conventional fractioned whole breast irradiation with a concurrent boost to the tumor bed(WBI 1.8Gy x28 and SIB 2.15Gy x28). All radiotherapy will be delivered by external beam-intensity modulated radiotherapy. the purpose of this study is to assess whether the accelerated hypo-fractioned is non-inferior to the conventional fractionated radiotherapy. The outcomes evaluation will include acute toxicity , late toxicity including breast fibrosis and cardiac disease, cosmetic outcome ,local control and survival outcome.

RADIATION: Whole Breast irradiation Plus simultaneous tumor bed Boost
Degree of acute skin toxicity, To determine the acute toxicity of accelerated hypo-fractionated whole breast irradiation with concurrent boost to the tumor bed in 18 fractions and whether it will be non-inferior to the conventional fractionated WBI with a concurrent boost, 2 Weeks after the end of radiotherapy.
local control, To determine the local control in women with early stage breast cancer treated with accelerated hypo-fractionated whole breast irradiation with concurrent boost to the tumor bed in 18 fractions and whether it will be non-inferior to the conventional fractionated WBI with a concurrent boost, From data of randomization until 60 months after the end of radiotherapy of last patients|Degree of chronic skin toxicity and cosmesis after radiotherapy, To assess the chronic skin toxicity and measure cosmesis using the Harvard cosmoses scale in patients and to determine whether the accelerated hypo-fractionated WBI with a concurrent boost is non-inferior to standard WBI with concurrent boost., 6 months after radiotherapy|Degree of chronic skin toxicity and cosmesis after radiotherapy, To assess the chronic skin toxicity and measure cosmesis using the Harvard cosmoses scale in patients and to determine whether the accelerated hypo-fractionated WBI with a concurrent boost is non-inferior to standard WBI with concurrent boost., 2 years after radiotherapy|Degree of chronic skin toxicity and cosmesis after radiotherapy, To assess the chronic skin toxicity and measure cosmesis using the Harvard cosmoses scale in patients and to determine whether the accelerated hypo-fractionated WBI with a concurrent boost is non-inferior to standard WBI with concurrent boost., 5 years after radiotherapy|overall survival, To determine whether the overall survival after hypo-fractionated breast radiation with concurrent boost is non-inferior to conventional fractionated radiation therapy with concurrent boost., From date of randomization until 60 months after the end of radiotherapy of last patients
