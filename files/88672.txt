Chimeric Antigen Receptor-Modified T Cells for Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of HER2-CAR-T cell Infusion for advanced HER2 positive breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: HER-2-targeting CAR T Cells infusion
Number of participants with Adverse events, 24weeks
Tumor load, Tumor load will be quantified with radiology, bone marrow and/or blood, 24weeks
Progress free disease (PFS), 1 year|Overall survival (OS), 3 years
By enrolling patients with advanced HER2 positive breast cancer adapted to enrolled criteria, this study will document for the first time the safety and the short and long term efficacy of HER2-CAR-T cell infusion for advanced HER2 positive breast cancer.The CAR consists of a HER-2 targeting antibody scFv with two intracellular signaling domains derived from CD3 zeta and CD28. Autologous T cells will be gene-engineered with the CAR gene using a retrovirus vector. Prior to T cell infusion, the patients will be subjected to preconditioning treatment. After T cell infusion, the patients will be evaluated for 24 months for adverse reactions, persistence of CAR T cells and efficacy.
