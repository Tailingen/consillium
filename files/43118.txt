The purpose of this study is to determine whether human-papillomavirus (HPV) self-sampling can be used as a primary screening test for unscreened women.
Cancer of the Uterine Cervix
DEVICE: Cobas HPV DNA Test|OTHER: Papanicolau test
Number of Participants Who Performed HPV Self-testing Compared to the Number of Participants Who Responded to the Invitation to Come to the Hospital for Pap Testing, Compare the participation rate to cervical cancer screening for home-based human papillomavirus testing based on self-sampling versus clinic-based, physician-performed Pap testing., 1 year
Proportion of Women With a Positive HPV Self-test Who Underwent All the Recommended Follow-up Clinical Investigations., Assess the compliance with further follow-up among women having tested positive for the presence of HPV at baseline screening., 1 year
Women residing in the canton of Geneva, aged between 25 and 69 years, who haven't had a Pap test in the last three years, will be invited to participate. Participation to the study will be encouraged through public displays, social networks, and medical consultations. Women meeting the eligibility criteria will be enrolled in the study. They will be randomized into two groups and will receive a home-sent letter, inviting them to either come in for a Pap test or to perform and send back the HPV self-sample that they'll receive at their domicile. Both groups will also receive a questionnaire, in order to better understand the reasons for their previous non-attendance to cervical cancer screening.
