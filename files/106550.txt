Determination of the effect of balugrastim on the duration and severity of severe neutropenia.
Chemotherapy-induced Neutropenia
BIOLOGICAL: Balugrastim|DRUG: Pegfilgrastim|DRUG: Chemotherapy Regimen
Duration of Severe Neutropenia in Cycle 1, Severe neutropenia was defined as Grade 4 neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count \[ANC\] \<0.5 x 10\^9/liter \[L\]). The duration of severe neutropenia was calculated by cycle as the number of days from the first day in which the ANC fell below 0.5 x 10\^9/L after beginning a chemotherapy cycle until the participant had an ANC ≥0.5 x 10\^9/L within the cycle., Cycle 1 (cycle length = 21 days)
Number of Participants With Febrile Neutropenia, Febrile neutropenia was defined as an imputed or observed ANC \<0.5 x 10\^9/L and oral temperature ≥38.2 degrees celsius (°C) occurring on the same day. Number of participants with febrile neutropenia over all cycles (Cycles 1 to 4) has been reported., Cycles 1 to 4 (each cycle length = 21 days)|Duration of Severe Neutropenia in Cycles 2, 3, and 4, Severe neutropenia was defined as Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC \<0.5 x 10\^9/L). The duration of severe neutropenia was calculated by cycle as the number of days from the first day in which the ANC fell below 0.5 x 10\^9/L after beginning a chemotherapy cycle until the participant had an ANC ≥0.5 x 10\^9/L within the cycle., Cycles 2, 3, and 4 (each cycle length = 21 days)|Time to Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) Recovery in Cycles 1, 2, 3, and 4, Time to ANC recovery was defined as the time from the nadir ANC to an ANC ≥1.5 x 10\^9/L and was calculated for participants with ANC \<1.5 x 10\^9/L after the beginning of a chemotherapy cycle. Time to ANC recovery was calculated by cycle as the number of days from the nadir (the lowest ANC during a chemotherapy cycle) until a participant reached an ANC \>1.5 x 10\^9/L., Cycles 1, 2, 3, and 4
