Feasibility and Efficacy of a Combination of a SEMS and Vacuum Wound Treatment (VACStent)
Open, prospective, one-arm feasibility and efficacy study of a European conformity (CE) certified Combination product of two CE certified medical devices in the intended indication.

Evaluation of the suitability of the medical device for sealing leaks in the gastrointestinal tract
Perforation Esophagus|Esophageal Cancer|Esophageal Achalasia|Esophageal Diseases
DEVICE: VACStent
Technique - % of patients with successful implantation of VACStent, % of patients with successful implantation of VACStent, From date of first implantation of VACStent until the leak is sealed or the treatment is canceled from any serious medical cause, whichever came first, up to 12 months
Healing of leak - % of patients with successful implantation of VACStent, % of patients with a sealed leak after successful treatment with VACStent, From date of first implantation of VACStent until the leak is sealed or the treatment is canceled from any serious medical cause, whichever came first, up to 12 months|Treatment of sepsis, % of patients with successful treatment of sepsis leak after successful implantation of VACStent, From date of first implantation of VACStent until the leak is sealed or the treatment is canceled from any serious medical cause, whichever came first, up to 12 months|Migration rate, % of patients with migration of VACStent after successful implantation of VACStent, From date of first implantation of VACStent until the leak is sealed or the treatment is canceled from any serious medical cause, whichever came first, up to 12 months|Bleeding, % of patients with bleeding after successful implantation of VACStent, From date of first implantation of VACStent until the leak is sealed or the treatment is canceled from any serious medical cause, whichever came first, up to 12 months|Arrosion of tissue structures, % of patients with % of patients with bleeding after successful implantation of VACStent after successful treatment with VACStent, From date of first implantation of VACStent until the leak is sealed or the treatment is canceled from any serious medical cause, whichever came first, up to 12 months|Sealing of leak - % of patients with successful implantation of VACStent, % of patients with a sealed leak after successful treatment with VACStent, From date of first implantation of VACStent until the leak is sealed or the treatment is canceled from any serious medical cause, whichever came first, up to 12 months
The investigators analyzed the outcome of using a hybrid medical device (self-expanding metal stents (SEMS) with negative pressure wound therapy) in the treatment of leaks of the upper gastrointestinal tract
