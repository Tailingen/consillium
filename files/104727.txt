Tempus Priority Study: A Pan-tumor Observational Study
Observational study that will be collecting clinical and molecular health information from cancer patients who have received comprehensive genomic profiling and meet the specific eligibility criteria outlined for each cohort with the goal of conducting research to advance cancer care and create a dataset that furthers cancer research.

Support prospective and retrospective research studies, To support prospective and retrospective research studies on participants with specific cancer types, Up to 10 years|Describe real world treatment outcomes, To describe real world treatment outcomes (such as real-world response, real world duration of response, real world progression free survival, real world time to next treatment, real world time to treatment discontinuation, and overall survival), Up to 10 years|Review medical information for standard of care decisions and health outcomes, To review medical information for standard of care decisions in the future and general health outcomes, Up to 10 years
The Study will collect combined clinical and molecular health information for cancer patients in the United States from multiple academic medical centers and community oncology practices. Participants who agree to join the Study will have their molecular profiling results, associated clinical health information, and longitudinal outcomes health information collected by the participating Institution for submission to Tempus. The specific goal of the Study is to create an outcomes-based dataset for future research to improve cancer treatment.
