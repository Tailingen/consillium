Prospective Study of Using Novel Bipolar Scissors in Colorectal Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection
This study is an interventional, prospective, single-center study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a novel radiofrequency and microwave ablation flexible bipolar (SpydrBlade Flex, CREO Medical, UK) for colorectal ESD in patients with superficial colorectal neoplasia.

This is a prospective study with the following study Objectives:

1. To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a novel radiofrequency and microwave ablation flexible bipolar (SpydrBlade Flex, CREO Medical, UK) for colorectal ESD.
2. To assess the impact of the procedure on patient recovery time and postoperative adverse event.

This study is an interventional, prospective, single-center study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a novel radiofrequency and microwave ablation flexible bipolar (SpydrBlade Flex, CREO Medical, UK) for colorectal ESD in patients with superficial colorectal neoplasia. Patients will undergo a ESD for superficial colorectal neoplasia. All ESD procedures will be performed by expert endoscopists with at least 50 prior experience of ESD.
