The Ailliance Post-Market Clinical Study
The purpose of this clinical study is to collect performance and safety data for post-market Medtronic devices indicated for cranial and/or spinal indication(s).

Subjects are enrolled and followed postoperatively to 24 months. The Ailliance clinical study is intended to collect data congruous with routine clinical care practices.
Spinal Deformity|Spinal Degenerative Disorder|Spinal Fusion Failure|Spinal Trauma|Spinal Tumor Case
DEVICE: Follow-up schedule: pre-operative baseline up to 24-months post-procedure
Surgical success (for any Medtronic eligible market-released Advanced Energy device(s) used), Defined by amount of: 1) blood loss (mL) during surgery and/or 2) total operation time and/or 3) length of stay in the hospital (measured from surgery completion to discharge), and/or 4) investigator opinion on whether the device(s) directly assisted in the completion of surgery, Discharge (from Index Surgery completion to 14 days post-operatively)|Fusion Success (for any Medtronic eligible market-released Interbodies and Biologics, Other Spinal Hardware, and/or Rods and Screws device(s) used), Fusion success at 12-months is determined through evaluation of radiographic evidence (X-ray and/or CT scan) by the investigator by: (1) Confirming the presence of bone bridging, and (2) if using the Brantigan \& Steffee's Classification scale: a score D and/or E are determined., 12 months|Surgical performance (for any Medtronic eligible market-released Powered Systems, Instruments, and Imaging device(s) used), Surgical performance, as defined as the rate at which the device directly assisted in the completion of surgery in the investigator's opinion.

If O-Arm used: whether O-Arm was utilized for validation of implant placement during the surgery., Index Surgery|Device performance (for any Medtronic eligible market-released Robotics and Navigation device(s) used), Robotics: Planned number of screws prior to index surgery compared to number of screws device assisted with placement during surgery. Navigation: Whether or not device was utilized for validation of screw placement during surgery., 24 months|Pain Resolution (for select Medtronic eligible market-released Other Spinal Hardware device(s) used), Resolution of pain at 12-months when compared to baseline Pain reported by the subject using the Neck Disability Index (NDI) questionnaire, 12 months|Stabilization (for any Medtronic eligible market-released device(s) used from the following product groups: Other Spinal Hardware), * Stabilization is the radiographic verification of no noticeable hardware and/or implant loosening, the presence of the hardware in the appropriate position without cage subsidence and/or implant loosening, and noticeable stable alignment of the spine post-surgery.
* Since all products are market-released, assessment for stabilization will be completed by the investigator.
* Stabilization will be assessed by the collection of radiographic evidence (X-Ray(s) and CT-scan(s))., Up to 12 months|Deformity Correction (for specified Medtronic eligible market-released device(s) used from the following product groups: Spinal Tethers), Defined by the change of Cobb angle at 12-month, 12 months
Rate of Device-related Adverse Events any Medtronic eligible market-released Cranial & Spinal Technologies (CST) device(s) as aligned with ISO 14155 standards, The secondary endpoint is defined as the rate of occurrence for device-related adverse events, 24 months|Stabilization [for any Medtronic eligible market-released device(s) used from the following product groups: Interbodies and Biologics, Rods and Screws], * Stabilization is the radiographic verification of no noticeable hardware and/or implant loosening, the presence of the hardware in the appropriate position without cage subsidence and/or implant loosening, and noticeable stable alignment of the spine post-surgery.
* Since all products are market-released, assessment for stabilization will be completed by the investigator.
* Stabilization will be assessed by the collection of radiographic evidence (X-Ray(s) and CT-scan(s))., Up to 12 months|Deformity Correction [for specified Medtronic eligible market-released device(s) used from the following product groups: Rods and Screws], * Deformity correction is defined by the change of Cobb angle at the 12-month postoperative visit compared to baseline.
* Assessment(s) for deformity correction will be completed by the investigator. The investigator will determine whether the subject meets requirements of deformity correction based on the comparison of the Cobb angle measurements at all postoperative visits, when compared to the subject's baseline assessments.
* Cobb angle measurements will be provided through collection of radiographic evidence (X-Ray(s) and CT-scan(s)) and assessed by the investigator., 12 months
