A Comprehensive Smoking Cessation Intervention Duration Radiation for Upper Aerodigestive Cancers
Smoking is the greatest risk factor for upper aerodigestive cancers (thoracic or head and neck) and negatively impacts survival and other outcomes, but many patients have difficulty quitting after their diagnosis. Smoking cessation interventions for cancer patients thus far have had limited success. This is a pilot randomized controlled trial designed to determine if a new comprehensive, evidence-based smoking cessation intervention can improve quit rates for cancer patients who smoke.
