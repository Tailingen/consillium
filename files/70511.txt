This first-in-human, phase 1 study will consist of 2 parts. In Part A (Dose Escalation), the primary objectives will be to investigate the safety and tolerability of DS-9606a in advanced solid tumors and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose for expansion (RDE). In Part B (Dose Expansion), the safety and tolerability of DS-9606a will be further explored and the overall response rate will be assessed.

The secondary objectives of the study will assess pharmacokinetic properties of DS-9606a and investigate the duration of response and progression-free survival of DS-9606a, and assess the immunogenicity of DS-9606a.
