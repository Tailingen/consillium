A Descriptive Study of Baseline Characteristics, Clinical Outcomes, and Treatment Patterns of HR+/HER2- Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients Treated With Alpelisib Plus Fulvestrant Who Have Received Fulvestrant in Any Prior Line of Therapy
This was a non-interventional, retrospective cohort study of patients with HR+/HER2- aBC treated with alpelisib (ALP) plus fulvestrant (FUL) who have received fulvestrant in any prior line of therapy (LoT). This study utilized de-identified individual patient data from the United States (US) ConcertAI Patient360 Breast Cancer database, sourced from electronic health records (EHR) (i.e., secondary use of data). Patients were indexed at their start date of the earliest alpelisib plus fulvestrant regimen and followed until their death date or last confirmed activity date in the absence of an observed death.
HR+/HER2- Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer
Overall survival (OS), OS was defined as the length of time from the start date of the earliest alpelisib plus fulvestrant regimen to the date of death, or last confirmed activity date in the absence of an observed death event., Up to approximately 21 months|Real-world progression-free survival (rwPFS), rwPFS was defined as the length of time from the start date of the earliest alpelisib plus fulvestrant regimen to the first documented progression or death date occurring at least 14 days after the index date, or last adequate tumor assessment date in the absence of an observed progression or death event., Up to approximately 21 months|Line of treatment of ALP+FUL received, Baseline|Line of treatment number of index regimens stratified by index year, Baseline|Starting dose of alpelisib, Baseline|Number of prior regimens, Baseline|Prior fulvestrant treatment category, Baseline|Prior regimens of patients who received alpelisib plus fulvestrant as first-line treatment, Baseline|Number of prior fulvestrant regimens prior to alpelisib plus fulvestrant, Baseline|Percentage of patients with prior exposure to CDK4/6i in the adjuvant setting, Baseline|Percentage of patients with prior exposure to chemotherapy in the metastatic setting, Baseline|Time to treatment discontinuation, Up to approximately 21 months|First antineoplastic regimen received after discontinuation of the alpelisib plus fulvestrant regimen, Up to approximately 21 months
