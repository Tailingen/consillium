mFOLFIRINOX as Adjuvent Chemotherapy in Treating Chinese Pancreatic Cancer Patients
Although FOLFIRINOX regimen was recently presented to be effective as adjuvant chemotherapy for resectable pancreatic cancer in selected patients who have good physical condition, there is still insufficient evidence on this regimen in treating resectable pancreatic cancer patients in China. Since for many tumors, different races may show different responses to the same regimen, we design this open phase â…¡ study to evaluate the the efficacy and safety of mFOLFIRINOX as adjuvant chemotherapy for resectable pancreatic cancer in China.
Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: Folfirinox
Disease free survival, From the date of first drug administration until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, up to 24 months
Overall survival, From the date of first drug administration until the date of death, up to 24 months
This is a phase II study. Patients with resectable pancreatic carcinoma will receive adjuvant chemotherapy of FOLFIRINOX for 6 months.

Primary endpoint is the disease free survival. Secondary endpoints are overall survival, safety and quality of life.
