Assessment of Tool Placement in Pulmonary Nodule(s) Using a Robotic Navigational Bronchoscopy System
The aim of this research study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the ION endoluminal system at reaching and obtaining biopsies from lung nodules when used in combination with 3-dimensional imaging such as CT scans. Data on safety will also be collected.
Lung Cancer
DEVICE: Biopsy with the Robotic- Ion Endoluminal System with Adjunct Real-time Imaging
Tool in Nodule, Rate of achieving biopsy tool position within the targeted nodule(s), documented by means of intraprocedural 3D imaging.

Defined as how often the biopsy needle used to sample the tissue is positioned directly within the nodule before the sample is taken.

If biopsy forceps are used, it is how often the instrument is surrounding the nodule before the sample is taken, At time of the biopsy procedure (Day 0)
Diagnostic accuracy of sample(s) obtained, Diagnostic accuracy will be calculated as the rate of diagnosis made using samples obtained during the study procedure (true positives and true negatives) relative to the number of cases performed.

Diagnostic yield may also be reported in conjunction with diagnostic accuracy and calculated as the rate of malignant and benign diagnosis made relative to the number of cases performed; non-diagnostic samples will not be included in the numerator., Up to 13 months post procedure|Sensitivity for malignancy of sample(s) obtained, Sensitivity for malignancy of samples is assessed as the number of subjects with a malignant condition determined through the study procedure (true positives) relative to the number of subjects with an underlying malignant disease state (true positives + false negatives). The subjects underlying disease state will be determined by follow-up diagnostic interventions or treatment decisions/interventions, and/or radiographic follow-up., Up to 13 months post procedure
Rate of procedure-related Adverse Events through 30 days post-procedure, The study's safety endpoint is the rate of procedure-related Adverse Events through 30 days post-procedure, 30 days|Exploratory endpoint 1: Procedure-related characteristics, Procedure time (from catheter inserted into the patient's airways to catheter removed from the patient's airways) will be reported., At time of the biopsy procedure (Day 0)|Exploratory endpoint 2:rEBUS visualization characteristics, The frequency of rEBUS visualization view during the biopsy will be summarized., At time of the biopsy procedure (Day 0)|Exploratory endpoint 3: Biopsy workflow, The sequence of biopsy tools used will be summarized., At time of the biopsy procedure (Day 0)
This is a prospective, interventional, multicentre, single arm study which will be conducted in Europe and will involve up to 200 patients undergoing a pulmonary nodule biopsy using the Ion Endoluminal System in conjunction with 3D imaging.

The objectives of the study are focused on evaluating the procedure characteristics of the pulmonary nodule biopsy procedure, including rate of tool in nodule, diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity for malignancy and safety.

All subjects will be followed up at 1 week and 1 month after the procedure. If the biopsy did not provide a diagnosis or did not show cancer and was still under observation at the 1 month visit, then they will have further follow up at 6 months. Similarly, if the status is unchanged (non-malignant diagnosis) at 6 months, the patients a 13 months visit should be completed.
