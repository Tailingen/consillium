Disease Control Rate With RECIST 1.1 Criteria, Disease control rate (DCR) is the percentage of participants who experienced a complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 criteria below.

* CR = Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm.
* PR = At least 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.
* SD = Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters while on study.
* Progressive Disease (PD) = At least 20% increase in the sum of longest diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters while on study. Appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression., up to 17 months
Disease Control Rate With irRECIST Criteria, Disease control rate (DCR) is the percentage of participants who experienced a immune-related complete response (irCR), partial response (irPR), or stable disease (irSD) assessed by the Immune-Related Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (irRECIST) criteria below.

* irCR = Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm.
* irPR = At least 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameters of target lesions, compared to baseline.
* irSD = Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, compared to baseline.
* Immune-related Progressive Disease (irPD) = At least 20% increase in the sum of longest diameters of target lesions AND at least 5mm absolute increase, compared to baseline. Appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression. Confirmation scan required at least 4 weeks later., up to 17 months|Progression-free Survival, Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time duration from the first day of protocol treatment to the earlier date of disease progression or death due to any cause. PFS time will be censored at the date of last follow-up for surviving patients with disease control., up to 17 months|Overall Survival, Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time duration from the first day of protocol treatment to the date of death due to any cause, and will be censored at the date of last follow-up for patients still alive., up to 17 months|Number of Treatment-Related Adverse Events Per CTCAE v5.0, Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) are evaluated according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0, as grades 3-5 and at least possibly attributed to study treatment. TRAEs are evaluated from the start of study treatment through 30-days after the last treatment dose., up to 19 weeks
This two-stage single arm phase II trial will evaluate the efficacy of niraparib with dostarlimab and radiation therapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer

The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including evaluations and follow up visits.

The names of the experimental interventions involved in this study are:

* Dostarlimab
* Niraparib
* Radiation Therapy

It is expected that about 25 people will take part in this research study. An initial 15 participants will be enrolled during the first stage and evaluated for treatment disease control, if none of the initial 15 participants achieve disease control the study will be terminated.

It is expected participants will be on the research study for as long as the experimental interventions are safe, and their metastatic pancreatic cancer does not progress with up to 5 years of follow up after participants stop taking the experimental interventions.

This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the intervention is being studied.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved dostarlimab as a treatment for any disease. Dostarlimab is a type of antibody (a protein that attaches to other cells to fight off infection) that is believed to work by attaching to a protein called PD-1 on Tcells.

This PD-1 protein controls parts of the immune system (the system in the body that fights off infections and diseases) by shutting down certain immune responses responsible for recognizing and destroying cancer cells. The investigators believe that dostarlimab will inhibit the PD-1 protein, thus allowing the immune cells to recognize and destroy cancer cells. The FDA has not approved niraparib for metastatic pancreatic cancer, but it has been approved for other uses. Niraparib is a type of drug called a "PARP inhibitor", which blocks DNA (the genetic material of cells) damage from being repaired or may prevent damage from occurring in the first place. In cancer treatment, inhibiting PARP may help kill cancer cells by not allowing the cancer cells to repair its DNA damage or prevent DNA damage from occurring. It is believed that the combination of dostarlimab, niraparib, and radiation therapy may have a greater effect on metastatic pancreatic cancer cells than when these interventions are used alone.
