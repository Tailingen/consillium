Safety and Efficacy Study of CFI-402411 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Malignancies
The purpose of this study is to test the safety of an investigational drug called CFI-402411 alone and in combination with pembrolizumab and to study its effects in patients with advanced solid tumors who have progressed following previous therapies.

This study will be a first-in-human study evaluating the safety and tolerability of CFI-402411 in subjects with advanced solid malignancies, when CFI-402411 is administered as a single agent or in combination with pembrolizumab. CFI-402411 is an oral pill that blocks the function of HPK1. Blocking HPK1 could stimulate an immune response against the tumor in patients. This immune response could be further enhanced when combined with pembrolizumab. The data obtained from this study will determine the dose and schedule and subject selection for further clinical studies.

Pre-clinical findings support further development of CFI-402411 as a novel anti-cancer agent, and the combination of CFI-402411 with pembrolizumab as a potential strategy to improve outcomes of subjects with advanced malignancies.
