Primary Colorectal Signet Ring Cell Carcinoma and the Risk of Multiple Primary Gastrointestinal Malignancies
This original research investigates the critical issue of gastrointestinal (GI) second primary malignancies (SPMs) in patients with signet ring cell carcinoma (SRCC), a rare and aggressive subtype of colorectal cancer. Utilizing the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, the investigators assessed the risk of GI SPMs, particularly within 2-11 months post-SRCC diagnosis.

The standardized incidence ratio of developing gastrointestinal second primary malignancies following primary colorectal signet ring cell carcinoma, The surveillance, epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database was used to calculate the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) as Observed/Expected (O/E) for second primary gastrointestinal malignancies. Patients diagnosed with primary colorectal SRCC between 2000 and 2021 were included. The event was defined as the appearance of an SPM in a different site from the original cancer at a new GI organ (esophagus, stomach, small intestine, cecum, appendix, rectum, anus and anal canal, liver, gallbladder, intrahepatic bile duct, pancreas, retro-peritoneum, and colon)., from Jan, 2000 till Dec, 2021
The excess risk of developing gastrointestinal second primary malignancies following primary colorectal signet ring cell carcinoma, The excess risk per 10,000 was calculated using SEER\*stat software., from Jan, 2000 till Dec, 2021
