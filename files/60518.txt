A First-in-human Study of GENA-104A16 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a first in human phase I , open label study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of GENA 104A16 administered as a single agent by intravenous (IV) once every 2 weeks ( q2w (1 cycle = 2 weeks) in patients with advanced solid tumors, for who no standard therapy exists, or standard therapy has failed.
