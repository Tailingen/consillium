Camrelizumab Combined With Apatinib in the Treatment of Epithelial Ovarian Cancer
The aim of this study is to explore the effectiveness and safety of camrelizumab combined with apatinib mesylate in the treatment of relapsed platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer
Immune Checkpoint Inhibition
DRUG: Camrelizumab
Objective response rate, the proportion of patients with tumor size reduction of a predefined amount, within 1 year
Progression Free Survival, the length of time during and after the treatment of a disease, such as cancer, that a patient lives with the disease but it does not get worse, within 1 year|Disease Control Rate, Refers to the percentage of confirmed complete remission, partial remission and stable disease (â‰¥ 8 weeks) among patients with evaluable efficacy., within 1 year|drug safety, Incidence of test drug relative adverse events,Incidence of serious adverse events, within 1 year|6 months and 12 months overall survival, It is the percentage of people in a study or treatment group still alive for a given period of time after diagnosis, within 2 year
The anti-PD-1 drug camrelizumab combined with apatinib mesylate was used to treat relapsed platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer, and the effectiveness and safety of the treatment plan was evaluated by objective remission rate, progression-free survival, and major safety indicators , so as to provide patients a more beneficial treatment plan.
