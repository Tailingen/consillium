AFP Specific T Cell Receptor Transduced T Cells Injection(C-TCR055) in Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma
A phase 1 study that aimed to assess the safety and anti-tumor activity of C-TCR055 injection in unresectable HCC patients.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: AFP Specific T Cell Receptor T Cells
Incidence of treatment related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0[Safety of C-TCR055], Determine if treatment with C-TCR055 is safe through assessment of adverse events(AEs) and serious adverse events(SAEs) as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, start treatment to 12 months
ORR, Overall response rate based on RECIST v1.1, 3 months and 6 months|DOR, Duration of remission, 12 months|PFS, Progression free survival, 12 months|OS, Overall survival, 6 months and 12 months
DCR, Disease Control Rate based on RECIST v1.1, 3 months and 6 months
This study plans to enroll 9 patients to assess the safety of C-TCR055. Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will receive a single dose of C-TCR055 injection, and will be followed up post treatment for safety monitoring. The follow up period will last 12 months.
