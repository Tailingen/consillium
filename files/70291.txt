A Pilot Preoperative Trial of Ganetespib With Paclitaxel for Triple-Negative Breast Cancer
Based on preclinical data implicating GR, AR, and JAK/STAT activation as potent mechanisms of breast cancer cell survival despite chemotherapy administration (i.e. chemotherapy resistance), the study will test a novel approach for improving chemotherapy effectiveness by adding Hsp90 inhibition to antagonize the anti-apoptotic signaling pathways that are initiated via GR, AR, and JAK/STAT activation.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Ganetespib|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Doxorubicin|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide
Change in GR protein, 2 weeks
Pathological Complete Response (pCR) rate, Defined as absence of invasive carcinoma in both the breast and axilla at the time of surgery, 6 month|Ganetespib toxicity, Side effects related to Ganetespib as graded per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4, 14 weeks
STUDY OBJECTIVES

Primary:

â€¢ To determine tumor GR, AR, JAK and other Hsp90 client protein expression before and after two weeks of ganetespib monotherapy

Secondary:

* To determine the pathological Complete Response (pCR) rate associated with weekly treatment of ganetespib plus paclitaxel followed by the combination treatment of doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide
* To characterize the toxicity of study treatment
