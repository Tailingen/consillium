Sorafenib Tosylate and Chemoembolization in Treating Patients With Unresectable Liver Cancer
RATIONALE: Sorafenib tosylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth or by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Chemoembolization kills tumor cells by blocking the blood flow to the tumor and keeping chemotherapy drugs near the tumor.

PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying side effects and best dose of sorafenib tosylate when given together with chemoembolization in treating patients with unresectable liver cancer.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma|Liver Cancer|Localized Unresectable Liver Cancer
DRUG: sorafenib tosylate|DRUG: doxorubicin hydrochloride|DRUG: cisplatin|DRUG: mitomycin C|PROCEDURE: transarterial chemoembolization|PROCEDURE: hepatic artery embolization
Dose adjustment, number and percentage of subjects with adverse events, laboratory changes, number and percentage of subjects with laboratory values that are outside the pre-determined ranges, cumulative toxicity, and TLT., 8 months
Time to Disease Progression, 8 months
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To evaluate the toxicity and safety of integrating sorafenib with chemoembolization for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To observe the imaging response (AASLD/EASL modification of RECIST) and time to progression following chemoembolization in conjunction with sorafenib.

OUTLINE:

Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily. Beginning 2 weeks later, patients undergo chemoembolization with cisplatin, doxorubicin hydrochloride, and mitomycin C.

Chemoembolizaton repeats once a month for up to 4 procedures in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months.
