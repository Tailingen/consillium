A Dose Escalation Trial of PR610 Treating Patients With Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose and the Dose-Limiting Toxicity of the drug to further evaluate safety and antitumor activity.
Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific
DRUG: PR610
Determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of PR610 for Both a 1-hour and a 24-hour Weekly IV Infusion, The first cohort of three subjects will receive PR610 at Dose Level 1. Subsequent cohorts will receive PR610 at a dose levels determined as per dose escalation criteria. The MTD will be defined as the dose level at which one (1) or fewer subject in six exhibit DLT with the next highest dose level demonstrating two (2) or more of six (6) subjects with DLT (or for which more than â‰¥33% of subjects exhibit DLT if the cohort size exceeds 6 subjects)., 3 weeks (1 cycle)|Determine the Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) of PR610 for Both a 1-hour and a 24-hour Weekly IV Infusion, DLT is defined as the following:

* Occurs during the first cycle of PR610
* Is considered PR610-related, as defined by "Definitely-related", "Probably-related" or "Possibly-related"
* Is clinically significant, as determined by the Principal Investigator

In addition, DLT will meet at least one of the criteria listed below using grading criteria from the CTCAEv4.

* Grade 4 hematologic toxicity
* Any drug-related toxicity that prevents administration of 100% of all doses of PR610 planned for Cycle 1
* Grade 3 or higher non-hematologic toxicity, 3 weeks (1 Cycle)
Evaluate the safety profile of PR610: Adverse Events, The number of adverse events experienced by participants will be measured., 30 days following the last administration of study treatment|Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of PR610 and PR610E for Both a 1-hour and a 24-hour Weekly Infusion, pre, 30 minutes into infusion, end of infusion, 1, 2, 4, 24, 48, and 72 hours post-infusion on Cycles 1 and 2|Evaluate the activity of PR610 in a general phase I population and in a subset of subjects with NSCLC genetically resistant to reversible EGFR inhibitors, Efficacy will be determined for each subject that received at least one dose of PR610 and had at least one post-baseline disease assessment. The following four outcomes will be tabulated:

Following informed consent, subjects undergo baseline evaluation and disease assessment. PR610 is administered intravenously weekly.

In the absence of progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity, subjects may continue to receive PR610. Intra-subject dose escalation (to no higher than the highest safe level) is allowed in subjects who are not experiencing dose limiting toxicity. Disease assessment will be repeated at week 6 and then every 8 weeks thereafter.

Pharmacokinetic (PK) assessment (PR610 and PR610E) will be performed for all subjects.

After determination of the MTD and the determination of the phase II dose, additional subjects with NSCLC that is genetically resistant to reversible EGFR inhibitors will be accrued into an expansion cohort.
