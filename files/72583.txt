Efficacy and Safety of JMT101 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumor
This study is a Phase I, open label, multi-center study of to evaluate the safety and efficacy of JMT101 in patients with advanced solid tumor.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: JMT101|DRUG: JMT101
Incidence of adverse events (defined by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03 (CTCAE V4.03))., From enrollment until 30 days after the last dose|Number of Subjects Experiencing DLTs (Dose Limiting Toxicity)., Time from the first dose of study drug up to 4 weeks|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), 28 days
Objective Response Rate (ORR), From first dose to disease progression or end of study, an average of 1 year|Disease control rate (DCR)., From first dose to disease progression or end of study, an average of 1 year|Progression free survival (PFS)., From first dose to disease progression or end of study, an average of 1 year|Overall survival (OS)., From first dose to death or end of study, an average of 1 year|Area under the concentration curve from time 0 to the concentration at last time point (AUC0-last) of JMT101., From enrollment until 30 days after the last dose|Maximum measured plasma concentration (Cmax) of JMT101., From enrollment until 30 days after the last dose|Time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) of JMT101., From enrollment until 30 days after the last dose|Half-life (T1/2) of JMT101., From enrollment until 30 days after the last dose|Immunogenicity profile of JMT101., Blood samples will be collected from subjects post treatment for assessment to detect the presence of anti-drug antibodies(ADA) and neutralizing antibodies by electrochemical luminescence(ECL)., From enrollment until 30 days after the last dose|Potential biomarkers detected in plasma or tumor issue DNA., The content of RAS(reticular activating system), EGFR(epidermal growth factor receptor), BRAF(B-Raf proto-oncogene) gene will be detected., From enrollment up to disease progression, an average of 1 year
The objective of the trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of JMT101 in patients with advanced solid tumor.

This study consists of two parts (Stage I and Stage II). Stage I was a dose escalation study, and Stage II was a dose expansion study.
