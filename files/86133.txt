In inoperable Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), consolidation immune checkpoint inhibition with the PD-L1 inhibitor durvalumab, given within 6 weeks after completion of concurrent platinum-based chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) for 12 months results in remarkable improvement of 3-year overall survival rates (57% vs 43.5%). This tri-modal therapy has become the new standard of care. Unfortunately, the tri-modal therapy frequently causes adverse events such as fatigue and, to a much lesser degree, cough, dyspnea and pneumonitis, resulting in treatment cessation in 15% - 53% of the patients (15%) (53%). For the most optimal overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS), compliance to the full treatment regimen, i.e. in the ideal situation 100% of patients completing their full course of CCRT and receiving durvalumab for one year, is expected to have significant and relevant beneficial effects. Optimizing patients' fitness is essential in order to handle the tough full treatment regimen.
