HCW9218 for Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
This is a Phase 1b/2, open-label, multi-center, competitive enrollment and dose-escalation study of HCW9218 in patients with advanced/metastatic pancreatic cancer.
Advanced Pancreatic Carcinoma
DRUG: HCW9218
Occurrence of Adverse Events and Treatment-Related Adverse Events, Evaluate the safety profile (as outlined by incidence of adverse events (AEs) based on CTCAE v5) of HCW9218 monotherapy in subjects with advanced/metastatic pancreatic cancer who have progressed on or are intolerant of standard first-line therapy, 12 Months|Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and designate the recommended Phase 2 dose level (RP2D) for Phase 2 study of HCW9218 in HCW9218-treated subjects, 12 Months
Objective Response Rate (ORR), To evaluate objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST version 1.1, 12 Months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), To assess the progression-free survival (PFS) per RECIST version 1.1, 12 Months|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from first administration of study intervention to the date of death due to any cause., 12 Months|Duration of Response, Duration of response is the time from response to progression or death., 12 Months
The study involves a Phase 1b dose escalation portion with up to 30 patients to determine the MTD using a 3+3 dose escalation design and to designate a dose level for the Phase 2 expansion phase (RP2D).

The Phase 2 portion of the study will consist of an expansion cohort of up to 39 patients receiving HCW9218 monotherapy at the RP2D level. An additional independent Phase 2 cohort of patients receiving HCW9218 at the RP2D level in sequence with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel will also be considered.
