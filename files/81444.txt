Food for Special Medical Purpose in Patients With Digestive Tract Tumor
This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, unblinded, parallel, multicenter, and non-inferiority study to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a Food for Special Medical Purpose product (FSMP) in participants with digestive tract tumor undergoing surgical resection during the perioperative period.

This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, unblinded, parallel, and multicenter, and non-inferiority study to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a FSMP in participants with digestive tract tumor undergoing surgical resection during the perioperative period. Half of the participants will receive FSMP, the other half will receive Enteral Nutrition Emulsion (TPF-T) as an active control.

Prealbumin, albumin, C-reactive protein (CRP), immunology parameters, vital signs, nutrition and safety-related laboratory parameters, compliance, and Adverse Events (AEs) will be evaluated in this study, to demonstrate its parity with TPF-T on efficacy and safety.
