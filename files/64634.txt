Prognostic Role of Minimal Residual Disease in Acute Myeloid Leukemia
Study purpose is to assess the prognostic role of Minimal Residual Disease (defined as medullary expression of WT1 gene), performed at Baseline and during treatment according to clinical practice. MRD results will be relate to treatment outcome and survival analysis variables (Overall Survival, Disease Free Survival, Cumulative Incidence of Relapse)
Acute Myeloid Leukemia|Minimal Residual Disease|Wilms Tumor
Response, Complete remission after chemotherapy, +28 days after End of induction chemotherapy - Before Allogeneic Transplant, average of 3 to 6 months from beginning of therapy
Disease Free Survival, Date of relapse or date of remission status, +28 days after End of induction chemotherapy -Before Allogeneic Transplant, average of 3 to 6 months from beginning of therapy - +30 days after Allogeneic Transplant - Date of Relapse for at least 1 year (up to 10 years)|Overall Survival, Time to last follow-up or death, Date of last follow-up for at least 1 year (up to 10 years) or Death|Cumulative Incidence of Relapse, CIR was calculated from the date of allo-HCT to the date of relapse or the date of the last follow-up, with death without relapse as a competing event., Date of Allogeneic Transplant, Date of Relapse for at least 1 year (up to 10 years - assessed every 3 months), Date of last follow-up for at least 1 year (up to 10 years) or Death
