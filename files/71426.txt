A Study of Belumosudil in People at Risk of Developing Graft-Versus-Host Disease After a Stem Cell Transplant
The purpose of this study is to find out whether adding belumosudil to a usual approach for reducing the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) may be an effective GVHD prevention approach for people with blood cancer who have a stem cell transplant. The investigators will also look at the safety of the study approach.

Change in GVHD/relapse-free survival (GRFS) at 1-year post-Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HCT), The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of belumosudil in the improvement of GRFS at 1-year post-HCT for patients receiving PTCY GVHD prophylaxis and separately for participants receiving CNI-based (CNI without PTCY) plus abatacept GVHD prophylaxis., 1 year
