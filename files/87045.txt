Decision-making of ctDNA in Patients With mCRC After Failure of First-line Treatment Containing Cetuximab - a Single-center, Phase II Clinical Study
This study aimis at detecting the genomic changes of ctDNA in patients of RAS and BRAF wild-type mCRC, who failed after first line treatment containing cetuximab. According to the results of ctDNA detection, individualized second-line targeted therapy strategies were developed to explore the disease control rate and prognostic significance of ctDNA-guided treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer.

Objective response rate, The percentage of patients whose tumors shrink by a certain amount and remain so for a certain amount of time, including patients with CR and PR.Objective tumor response was assessed using the Response Assessment Criterion for Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1)., April 10,2021-June 30,2021
overall survival, Time from enrollment to death from any cause.Lost visitors to the last follow-up time., April 10,2021-June 30,2021|progress free survival, Patients were randomized to solstice for any recorded time of tumor progression or death from any cause., April 10,2021-June 30,2021|Safety and tolerability, NCI -- CTC AE 4.0 will be used to evaluate the clinical safety of the treatment in the study.The incidence of adverse events in the subjects should be assessed at each clinical visit., April 10,2021-June 30,2021|duration of response, This is the time between the first assessment of a tumor as CR or PR and the first assessment as PD or death from any cause., April 10,2021-June 30,2021
