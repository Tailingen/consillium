Water Exchange Versus Carbon Dioxide for Colonoscopy
Colonoscopy is commonly used in screening for colorectal cancer. A refined technique of colonoscopy involving the use of water as the sole modality to aid colonoscope insertion, water exchange, has been described in recent research papers to decrease patient discomfort and pain, and to reduce the need for sedation during colonoscopy when compared with standard air insufflation. Carbon dioxide insufflation has been described to decrease patient discomfort after colonoscopy. No randomized trial has so far compared the use of water exchange to carbon dioxide insufflation. Our hypothesis is that water exchange inflicts less discomfort to patients undergoing colonoscopy than carbon dioxide insufflation. Patients undergoing screening colonoscopy in two centers in Norway, one center in Poland and one center in The Netherlands will be enrolled and randomized to examination of either of the two methods.
Colorectal Cancer|Colorectal Adenomas|Colorectal Polyps|Pain
OTHER: Water exchange colonoscopy|OTHER: Carbon dioxide insufflation
Pain during colonoscopy, Patients will be asked by a blinded assistant immediately after colonoscopy to score pain during the procedure., 1 hour
Pain during colonoscopy, Patients will be asked to report pain during colonoscopy to an unblinded study assistant., 30 minutes|Cecal intubation rate, Cecal intubation rate is defined as successful completion of colonoscopy insertion. This will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis according to group allocation., 1 hour|Cecal intubation time, The time taken to complete insertion of the colonoscope., 1 hour|Adenoma detection rate, Detection of adenomas during each colonoscopy procedure, 1 hour|Polyp detection rate, Detection of any colonic polyp, irrespective of histologic type, during each procedure., 1 hour|Dose of medication, Dose of sedative and analgesic medication needed to complete the colonoscopy., 1 hour
Single blinded randomized controlled trial.
