Phase II Study of Doxorubicin and Avastin® in Sarcoma.
This research is being done to find out if adding a drug called Avastin to an already approved regimen used for soft-tissue sarcoma, Doxorubicin, will improve overall survival, and slow disease progression. The study will also evaluate the overall safety of combining these drugs. It is not known if combining these drugs will improve outcome. Avastin has been approved for the treatment of metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum. It is not approved for the treatment of soft-tissue sarcoma when added to Doxorubicin.

RECIST, Study was terminated because of low accrual., 6 month PFS
The rationale for this trial is to improve the efficacy of prototypical anti-sarcoma chemotherapeutic regimen Doxorubicin when combined with Avastin®. Soft tissue sarcomas are highly vascular tumors and are therefore ideally suited to trials combining angiogenic inhibitors with chemotherapy. Several studies have revealed correlations between prognosis and surrogates for angiogenesis, including microvessel density, and circulating VEGF and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Avastin® in combination with Doxorubicin for the treatment of advanced soft-tissue sarcomas.
