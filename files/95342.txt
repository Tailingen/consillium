Brain metastases occur in 25-40% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It is one of the primary reasons resulting in treatment failure and the death. Whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) is the standard approach to the treatment of multiple brain metastases from NSCLC. Regardless of the treatment of brain metastases by WBRT combined with systemic chemotherapy,outcomes of NSCLC with brain metastases are still very poor. Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) can pass through the blood-brain barrier and show promising antitumor activity against brain metastases from NSCLC. Icotinib shows nearly the same effect as gefitinib in advanced NSCLC patients failed with chemotherapy.
