Epacadostat (INCB024360) Added to Preoperative Chemoradiation in Patients With Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer
The purpose of this research study is to evaluate epacadostat when given with routine radiation therapy and chemotherapy (capecitabine and oxaliplatin) to treat rectal cancer before routine surgery is performed to remove the tumor.
Rectal Cancer
DRUG: Epacadostat|RADIATION: Short-course radiation therapy|DRUG: CAPOX chemotherapy|DRUG: FOLFOX chemotherapy
Phase I only: Recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of epacadostat with standard of care radiation and chemotherapy in preoperative treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer, The recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) is defined as the dose level immediately below the maximally administered dose at which 0 or 1 of a cohort of 3 to 6 patients experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during first 2 cycles., Completion of the first 2 cycles of treatment for all patients (estimated to be 86 months)|Phase II Treatment Cohort only: Neoadjuvant Rectal (NAR) Score, Neoadjuvant Rectal Score (NAR Score) is calculated by following formula: NAR = (\[5pN

- 3(cT - pT) + 12\]2)/9.61 (with higher scores representing poorer prognosis), where cT=clinical tumor stage, pT=pathologic tumor stage, and pN=pathologic nodal stage., At the time of surgery (approximately week 28)
Phase I and Phase II Treatment Cohort only: Safety and toxicity profile of the combination as measured by adverse events experienced, The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 will be utilized for all toxicity reporting., Through 4 weeks after completion of treatment (approximately 28 weeks)|Phase I only: Neoadjuvant Rectal (NAR) Score, Neoadjuvant Rectal Score (NAR Score) is calculated by following formula: NAR = (\[5pN

- 3(cT - pT) + 12\]2)/9.61 (with higher scores representing poorer prognosis), where cT=clinical tumor stage, pT=pathologic tumor stage, and pN=pathologic nodal stage., At the time of surgery (approximately week 28)|Phase I and Phase II Treatment Cohort only: Pathological complete response rate (pCR), Pathologic complete response (pCR) is defined as no histology evidence of invasive tumor cells in the surgical specimen., At the time of surgery (approximately week 25)|Phase I and Phase II Treatment Cohort only: Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first. For those who are alive and do not experience progression, they are censored at the time of loss to follow-up., Through completion of follow-up (estimated to be 3 years and 32 weeks)|Phase I and Phase II Treatment Cohort only: Complete clinical response rate (cCR), Clinical complete response (cCR) is defined as no clinical evidence of tumor as assessed by radiographic, endoscopic, and physical examinations after completion of planned protocol therapy., At the time of preoperative assessment (approximately week 28)
The purpose of this research study is to evaluate epacadostat when given with routine radiation therapy and chemotherapy (capecitabine and oxaliplatin) to treat rectal cancer before routine surgery is performed to remove the tumor.
