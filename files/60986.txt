VA as Maintenance Therapy Post Allo-HSCT in MDS and AML
The goal of this phase 2 trial is to test the safety and efficacy of Venetoclax combined with Azacytidine as Maintenance Therapy post Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in Myelodysplastic Syndromes and Acute Myeloid Leukemia.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Venetoclax combined with Azacytidine
Relapse Rate, Relapse following CR is defined as reappearance of leukemic blasts in the peripheral blood or the finding of more than 5% blasts in the BM, not attributable to another cause (eg, BM regeneration after consolidation therapy) or extramedullary relapse., 1 year
Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as time from diagnosis to death from any cause or the last follow-up, through study completion, an average of 2 years|Progression Free Survival (PFS), For patients in morphologic remission, documented relapse was considered progression. Relapse following complete remission(CR) is defined as reappearance of leukemic blasts in the peripheral blood or the finding of more than 5% blasts in the BM, not attributable to another cause (eg, BM regeneration after consolidation therapy) or extramedullary relapse., 1 year
The investigators will evaluate the efficacy and safety of venetoclax combined with azacytidine as maintenance therapy post hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia. overall survival (OS), cumulative 1-year relapse- and progression-free survival (RPFS), time to relapse, relapse rate, incidence of acute and chronic GVHD, time to treatment discontinuation will be counted.
