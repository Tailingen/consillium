Cerebrospinal Fluid Immune Microenvironment Mechanism in Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase Positive Lung Cancer Patients
This is an an interventional study to explore the mechanism of cerebrospinal fluid immune microenvironment in patients with advanced anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive non-small cell lung cancer with brain metastases treated with Iruplinalib.
