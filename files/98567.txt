Decreasing Postoperative Complications by Goal-Directed Fluid Therapy During Esophageal Resection
Surgery for cancer of the esophagus is associated with a high risk of postoperative complications. It has been shown that the risk of postoperative complications can be decreased by optimising the amount and type of infusion fluids given during surgery, steered by measurement of cardiac stroke volume, mostly done with a device called esophageal Doppler. This device can however not be used during this type of surgery. This study wants to test the hypothesis that postoperative complications in patients operated for esophageal cancer can be partially prevented by using a goal directed strategy for the administration of fluids and drugs influencing the heart and vessels, based on measurement of stroke volume by pulse wave analysis (FloTrac).
