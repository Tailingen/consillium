Automatic Diagnosis of Early Esophageal Squamous Neoplasia Using pCLE With AI
Detection and differentiation of esophageal squamous neoplasia (ESN) are of value in improving patient outcomes. Probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) can diagnose ESN accurately.However this requires much experience, which limits the application of pCLE. The investigators designed a computer-aided diagnosis program using deep neural network to make diagnosis automatically in pCLE examination and contrast its performance with endoscopists.
