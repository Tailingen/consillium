MESO-CAR T Cells Therapy for Relapsed and Refractory Ovarian Cancer
The goal of this clinical trial is to study the feasibility and efficacy of anti-MESO antigen receptors (CARs) T cell therapy for relapsed and refractory ovarian cancer.
Ovarian Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: anti-MESO CAR-T cells|DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide
Safety measured by occurrence of study related adverse effects defined by NCI CTCAE 4.0, 1 years post infusion
Overall complete remission rate defined by the standard response criteria for malignant lymphoma for each arm, 12 months post infusion|Progress Free Survival (PFS) after administration, 12 months post infusion|Duration of CAR-positive T cells in circulation, 12 months post infusion|Detection of PD1 antibody in serum, 12 months post infusion
Primary Objectives

1.To determine the feasibility ad safety of anti-MESO CAR-T cells in treating patients with MESO-positive ovarian cancer.

Secondary Objectives

1. To access the efficacy of anti-MESO CAR-T cells in patients with ovarian cancer.
2. To determine in vivo dynamics and persistency of anti- MESO CAR-T cells.
