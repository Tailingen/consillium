CAncer, NUtrition and Taste - Validation of the CANUT-QVA Questionnaire on Eating Habits in Cancer Patients
Cancer patients are at high risk of undernutrition, which is generally more pronounced for solid tumours (upper digestive tract, Ear Nose and Throat (ENT), bronchial tubes). This undernutrition leads to major weight loss and cachexia, and may represent the first sign of a call for a diagnosis of cancer. Cancer-related undernutrition is multi-factorial origins and has multiple consequences.

Chemotherapy treatments can induce various adverse effects in patients, including sensory disturbances at the beginning of treatment in addition to disturbances that may already be present before any treatment. The alteration of taste and odour, observed in 86% of patients, can induce a change in food preferences, promote the development of aversions, and therefore, lead to a significant reduction in the pleasure of eating. Loss of appetite, decreased food intake and the development of aversions to certain foods are situations experienced by a large proportion of patients treated with chemotherapy.

The assessment of taste disorders in patients treated with chemotherapy is established through the use of questionnaires, interviews and taste tests.

Changes in the perception and identification of salty, sweet, bitter and sour flavours are common in patients treated with chemotherapy.

As regards food products, patients report developing olfactory hypersensitivity mainly for food of animal origin, in particular for odours of fish, frying, cheese and eggs.

The CANUT project aims to study the effect of pathology and chemotherapy on gustatory and olfactory mechanisms, and in particular on interindividual differences in the perception and appreciation of food.

In order to monitor the evolution of patients' eating habits over time, the diet-related quality of life questionnaire (CANUT-QVA) was constructed from items selected from the Well-being related to Food questionnaire (WELLBFQ) after eliminating questions that were too general or expressed in terms of importance to use perception-related responses as a priority.

After this part, an evaluation of the 9 dimensions of the CANUT-QVA questionnaire will be performed.

OTHER: Evaluation of the 9 dimensions of the CANUT-QVA questionnaire
Validate the 9 dimensions of the CANUT-QVA questionnaire identified during the general population analysis., The main evaluation criterion will be the adequacy between the responses to the food quality of life questionnaire by patients and the structure of the 9 dimensions as presented in the context (relevance of the questions for each dimension)., day 0
