PEP-CMV + Nivolumab for Newly Diagnosed Diffuse Midline Glioma/High-grade Glioma and Recurrent Diffuse Midline Glioma/High-grade Glioma, Medulloblastoma, and Ependymoma
This is a multisite, phase I/II clinical trial in children and young adults with newly-diagnosed high-grade glioma (HGG), diffuse midline glioma (DMG) and recurrent HGG/DMG, Medulloblastoma (MB), or ependymoma (EPN) to determine the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of a CMV-directed peptide vaccine plus checkpoint blockade.

Proportion of patients with unacceptable toxicity, An unacceptable toxicity will be defined as any life-threatening toxicity ≥ Grade 3 that is possibly, probably, or definitely related to the PEP CMV vaccine. There are exceptions listed in the protocol, From the first vaccine (day 21) through 2 weeks after the third vaccine (day 49) (estimated to be 42 days)
Mean change in immune response as measured by ELISPOT (IFN-γ) (Phase I only), For this analysis, the newly diagnosed patients (n=10) will be analyzed separately from the recurrent patients (n=20), Before vaccine #1 (day 21), before vaccine #4 (cycle 2 day 1, each cycle is 28 days), every 2 cycles (each cycle is 28 days), and upon removal from therapy (up to 10 years)|Median change in immune response as measured by ELISPOT (IFN-γ) (Phase I only), For this analysis, the newly diagnosed patients (n=10) will be analyzed separately from the recurrent patients (n=20), Before vaccine #1 (day 21), before vaccine #4 (cycle 2 day 1, each cycle is 28 days), every 2 cycles (each cycle is 28 days), and upon removal from therapy (up to 10 years)|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as time between the start of TMZ Day 1 and death., Through completion of follow-up (estimated to be 12 years)|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time between the start of TMZ on Day 1 and first documentation of death or disease progression/recurrence. Patients remaining alive without disease progression will have PFS censored at their last follow-up., Through completion of follow-up (estimated to be 12 years)
