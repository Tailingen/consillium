A Clinical Study of Ifinatamab Deruxtecan (I-DXd) in People With Metastatic Prostate Cancer (MK-2400-001)
Researchers are looking for new ways to treat metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Researchers have designed a study medicine called ifinatamab deruxtecan (also called I-DXd or MK-2400) to treat mCRPC. The goal of this study is to learn if people who receive I-DXd live longer overall and live longer without the cancer growing or spreading than people who receive chemotherapy,
Prostate Cancer|Prostatic Neoplasms
DRUG: Ifinatamab deruxtecan|DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Prednisone
Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause., Up to approximately 36 months|Radiographic Progression Free Survival (rPFS), rPFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression per prostate cancer working group (PCWG)-modifed Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 by blinded independent central review (BICR) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 36 months
Time to First Subsequent Therapy (TFST), TFST is defined as the time from randomization to initiation of the first subsequent anticancer therapy or death, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 36 months|Objective Response (OR), The OR is defined as a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per PCWG-modified RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR., Up to approximately 36 months|Duration of Response (DOR), For participants who demonstrate confirmed CR or PR, DOR is defined as the time from the first documented evidence of CR or PR until disease progression per PCWG-modified RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 36 months|Time to Pain Progression (TTPP), TTPP is defined as the time from randomization to pain progression based on the brief pain inventory-short form (BPI-SF) Item 3 "worst pain in 24 hours" and opiate analgesic use (AQA score)., Up to approximately 36 months|Time to Prostate-specific Antigen (PSA) Progression, Time to PSA progression is defined as the time from randomization to PSA progression. The PSA progression date is defined as the first date that 1) ≥25% increase and ≥2 ng/mL above the nadir which is confirmed by a second value≥3 weeks later if there is PSA decline from baseline, 2) ≥25% increase and ≥2 ng/mL increase from baseline beyond 12 weeks if there is no PSA decline from baseline., Up to approximately 36 months|PSA Response, PSA response rate is defined as the proportion of participants in the analysis population who have a PSA reduction of ≥50% from baseline with a consecutive confirmation assessment at least 3 weeks later per PCWG criteria, Up to approximately 36 months|Time to First Symptomatic Skeletal-related Event (SSRE), Time to first SSRE is defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of any of the following symptomatic skeletal-related events:

1. use of EBRT to prevent or relieve skeletal symptoms,
2. new symptomatic pathologic bone fracture (vertebral or non-vertebral),
3. spinal cord compression,
4. a tumor-related orthopedic surgical intervention., Up to approximately 36 months|Number of Participants Who Experienced at least One Adverse Event (AE), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention.

An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study intervention., Up to approximately 36 months|Number of Participants Who Discontinue Study Treatment Due to an Adverse Event (AE), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention.

An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study intervention., Up to approximately 36 months
