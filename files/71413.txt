Palliative Radiochemotherapy Against Palliative Surgery in Stage IV Rectal Cancer With Unresectable Metastases
Short course palliative radiotherapy (5x5Gy)to the pelvis in patients with symptomatic rectal tumours and with unresectable metastases may prevent palliative surgery with a good palliative outcome.The consolidating chemotherapy of XELOX may increase the efficacy of irradiation.

Patients with symptomatic rectal cancer and unresectable metastases receive 25 Gy in 5 fractions of 5 Gy over 5 days to the pelvis and XELOX consolidating chemotherapy after one week. Investigators arbitrarily assumed that palliative radiotherapy to the pelvis can replace the immediate surgery if at least 30% of patients would avoid delayed surgery until the end of their lives, or for at least 18 months in the case of long-term survival.
