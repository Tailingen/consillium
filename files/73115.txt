Thermal Radiofrequency Versus Neurolytic Saddle Rhizotomyfor Severe Pereneal Cancer Pain
The control of perineal malignant pain is difficult and challenging for pain physicians. Different modalities have been tried to treat this complex pain syndrome including pharmacotherapy and interventional therapy.

Neuroaxial phenol rhizolysis is simple and cheap option. However; for patients with pelvic or rectal neoplasms and intact bowel and bladder sphincteric functions, there are neurosurgical recomendations of selective sacral nerve roots rhizotomy blockade "as an alternative to chemical saddle rhizotomy".
Interactable Malignant Perineal Pain
PROCEDURE: Thermal radio Frequency, selective (unilateral S3, bilateral S4 and S5) saddle rhizotomy|DRUG: hyperbaric chemical saddle Rhizotomy (6 % pherol in glycerin)|DEVICE: Thermal RF lesioning is done using Bailys RF generator
Change in VAS, VAS: A 100mm scale, horizontal line with 2 stop ends; the left end means no pain \& the right end means the worst impaginable pain. It is a valid and practical scale for assessing chronic pain and for pain researches., baseline, one month, 3months|Functional improvement, Functional improvement. It is a self-reported analysis for the primary outcome after performing pain interventions. It is divided into four categorie (0-25%) ≈ no or minimal functional improvement, (\> 25% to 50%) ≈ mild improvement, (\>50% to 75%) ≈ moderate improvement, and (\>75% to 100%) ≈ marked improvement, baseline, one month, 3 months|Change in dose of daily drug consuption, drug (opioid, pregabalin \& amitryptiline) consumption (mg/day) ., base line, one month, 3 months
ODI, (Oswestry Disability Index): Self-reported questionnaire with 10 sections each with five items designed to assess limitations of various asctivities of daily living., baseline, one month, 3 months|PGIC, Patient satisfaction (PGIC): Patient Global Impression of Changes, baseline, one month and 3 months
40 selected patients were randomly allocated into 2 groups "20 patients each"

Group 1 "RF group": in which patients underwent thermal radio Frequency, selective (unilateral S3, bilateral S4 and S5) saddle rhizotomy.

Group 2 "phenol group": in which patients underwent hyperbaric chemical saddle rhizotomy using 6% phenol in glycerin.
