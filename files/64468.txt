Clinical Relevance of Detecting Molecular Abnormalities in Glial Tumor Exosomes
The purpose of this pilot study is that exosomes constitute a more interesting support for analyzes allowing a broader screening of molecular alterations to be carried out with more reliable, more sensitive and more efficient results than the reference Foundation One Liquid CDx test.

Gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors in adults. The heterogeneity of tumors, the lack of reliable criteria for identifying different subtypes make their histopathological diagnosis and their management complex. The molecular profiling from circulating exosomes is one of the most promising approaches to better characterize gliomas.

We will demonstrate the superiority of detection by NGS of molecular abnormalities present in exosomes from glioblastomas, compared to detection by the Foundation One Liquid CDx test on ctDNA.
