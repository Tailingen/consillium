Early and Systematic Shoulder Rehabilitation Following Cervical Lymph Node Dissection
A prospective, monocentric, controlled, randomized study of systematic early shoulder rehabilitation following cervical lymph node dissection for the prevention and treatment of shoulder dysfunction.
Rehabilitation
OTHER: sessions of shoulder rehabilitation
Disabilities of Shoulder, Arm and Hand Questionnaire (DASH), The total score is reported. The score is between 0 and 100. The higher the score, the higher the disability., 6 months postoperatively (M6)
Disabilities of Shoulder, Arm and Hand Questionnaire (DASH), The total score is reported. The score is between 0 and 100. The higher the score, the higher the disability., 3 and 12 months postoperatively (M3 and M12)|visual analog score for pain (M3, M6 and M12), The reported score is between 0 and 10. The higher the score, the higher the pain., 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively (M3, M6 and M12)|goniometric measurement of flexion and abduction of the shoulder, Goniometric measurement will be performed using a Rippstein's Plurimeter, with standardized position and movement for each measurement:

* Sitting on a chair, the bust is straight, arm hanging down the body.
* The plurimeter is placed on the distal part of the arm.
* The flexion is in the sagittal plane around a transverse axis in the frontal plane.
* The abduction is in the frontal plane around an anteroposterior axis contained in the sagittal plane., 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively (M3, M6 and M12)|European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire has 30 questions and includes the following scale:

- health and overall quality of life, scale have a score between 0 and 100. A high score indicates the preservation of a good quality of life., 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively (M3, M6 and M12)|European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire has 30 questions and includes the following scale:

- operating scale, scale have a score between 0 and 100. A high score for this scale indicates the preservation of a good quality of life., 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively (M3, M6 and M12)|European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire has 30 questions and includes the following scale:

- scale of generic symptoms. scale have a score between 0 and 100. A high score for this scale indicates the presence of symptoms acting as factors of deterioration of certain aspects of the quality of life., 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively (M3, M6 and M12)|European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Head and Neck cancer module (H&N35), EORTC QLQ-H\&N35 questionnaire evaluates the specific symptoms of patients with head and neck cancers. It consists of 35 items including 7 subscales .

subscale scores are reported, All items and scales give a score between 0 and 100.

For each subscale, a high score indicates the presence of a large number of specific symptoms, acting as factors of deterioration of certain aspects of the quality of life., 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively (M3, M6 and M12)|evaluate the compliance of patients to rehabilitation, (% of rehabilitation sessions performed over 36 sessions), 12 months postoperatively (M12)
Pre-inclusion: information, collection of consent, collection of antecedents and biometric data, clinical examination (goniometric measurement and visual analogic scale of pain), collection of DASH, EORTC QLQ-C30 and H\&N35 questionnaires.

Surgical intervention (J0) and randomization into 2 groups:

Group 1 - systematic early rehabilitation Group 2 - without systematic rehabilitation

M3, M6, M12: collection of complications, adjuvant treatments, number of physiotherapy sessions performed, clinical examination (goniometric measurement and visual analogic scale of pain), collection of DASH, EORTC QLQ- C30 and H\&N35 questionnaires.
