Ribociclib and Bicalutamide in AR+ TNBC
This is an open label, multi-institutional, single arm phase II trial of ribociclib in combination with bicalutamide in advanced AR+ triple-negative breast cancer. No randomization or blinding is involved.
Triple Negative Breast Cancer
DRUG: ribociclib|DRUG: ribociclib|DRUG: Bicalutamide
Phase I: Maximum Tolerated Dose, Phase I: Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for subjects receiving ribociclib and bicalutamide without experiencing dose-limiting toxicity(s) (DLT) per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4, D1 of treatment to end of cohort cycle (assessed at 28 days)|Phase II: Clinical benefit rate (CBR) of treatment combination, Compare sum of confirmed complete plus partial responses plus stable disease per response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria, D1 of treatment to end of 4 treatment cycles (assessed at 16 weeks)
Phase I: Objective Response Rate (ORR), The objective response rate is the proportion of all subjects with confirmed PR or CR according to RECIST 1.1, from the start of treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the start of treatment)., 2 years|Phase I: Duration of Response, Duration of overall response-the period measured from the time that measurement criteria are met for complete or partial response (whichever status is recorded first) until the date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since treatment started)., 2 years|Phase I: Assess Safety and Tolerability By summarizing counts and percentages grade 3-5 adverse events (NCI CTCAE Version 4), By summarizing counts and percentages grade 3-5 adverse events (NCI CTCAE Version 4), 2 years|Phase I: Ribociclib pharmacokinetics, Time points: Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax) Pre dose and 2-hours post-dose (Â±15 min) pharmacokinetic samples will be collected on Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 1 Day 15, Cycle 2 Day 1 and Cycle 2 Day 15., 2 months|Phase II: Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS will be summarized using Kaplan-Meier estimates of the median survival times., 2 years|Phase II: Objective Response Rate (ORR), by RECIST 1.1 on treatment with combination of bicalutamide and ribociclib in advanced AR+ TNBC, 2 years|Phase II: Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival is defined by the date of treatment initiation to date of death from any cause., 5 years|Phase II: Estimate Duration of Response, On treatment with combination of bicalutamide and ribociclib in advanced Androgen Receptor (AR)+ Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC), 2 years|Phase II: Evaluate Safety and Tolerability By summarizing counts and percentages grade 3-5 adverse events (NCI CTCAE Version 4), By summarizing counts and percentages grade 3-5 adverse events (NCI CTCAE Version 4), 2 years
This is a non-randomized, single arm, open label study of the combination of bicalutamide with ribociclib in subjects with advanced AR+ TNBC. Prior to enrollment on the phase II cohort, a phase I run-in study will be performed to ensure safety and tolerability of the combination of bicalutamide and ribociclib in subjects with advanced AR+ TNBC.

In both the phase I and phase II portions of the study, subjects will receive bicalutamide 150 mg orally, once daily, continuously on Day 1 to Day 28. Each cycle of treatment is 28 days.

In the phase I portion of the study, cohorts of subjects will receive ribociclib in escalated doses orally, once daily in a 28 day cycle. For the phase II portion, the RP2D dose of ribociclib will be based on the phase I run-in.

In the phase II cohort, a two week lead-in of bicalutamide monotherapy will occur before cycle 1 combination therapy (Day -14 to day -1). Then ribociclib will be added on day 1 of cycle 1. This lead-in will be for CTC androgen receptor analysis.
