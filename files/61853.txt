A Phase I Study of OSI-906 in Combination With Pemetrexed in Advanced Solid Tumor Malignancies
The purpose of the study is to test the safety of an experimental drug called OSI-906 when combined with pemetrexed at different dose levels and to find out the optimal doses of the two drugs that can be given as a combination. Pemetrexed has been widely used for treatment of certain solid organ tumors and is effective and approved for use in treatment of lung cancer and mesothelioma.

DRUG: OSI-906 and Pemetrexed
Assessment of dose-limiting toxicity, To define the dose of OSI-906 that can be combined with pemetrexed, 21 days
Progression-free survival, Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) \[Eur J Ca 45:228-247, 2009\]. Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria., 4-6 months
OSI-906 is a new agent that inhibits the insulin-like growth factor receptor pathway. Targeting this pathway appears to be a promising strategy to treat cancer based on laboratory studies. The present study will test if this agent can be administered safely in combination with pemetrexed, a commonly used chemotherapeutic agent.
