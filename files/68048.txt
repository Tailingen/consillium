Esophageal Arterial Infusion Chemotherapy Versus Systemic Intravenous Chemotherapy for Resectable Locally Advanced Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma: a Prospective, Multicentre, Randomised Controlled Clinical Study
This was a prospective, multicentre, randomised controlled clinical study to explore the safety and efficacy of esophageal arterial infusion chemotherapy in patients with resectable locally advanced oesophageal cancer, and to compare its safety and efficacy with systemic intravenous chemotherapy. The rate of surgical R0 resection as well as progression free survival (PFS) were the main indicators.
Resectable Locally Advanced Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: Esophageal arterial infusion chemotherapy|DRUG: Systemic intravenous chemotherapy
Surgical R0 resection rate, up to 1 year|Progression free survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from recruitment to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first., up to 1 year
Pathological complete response rate(PCRR), up to 1 year|Objective response rate(ORR), ORR is defined as the percentages of patients, relative to the total of enrolled subjects, achieving a complete (CR) or partial (PR) response, according to RECIST 1.1 criteria., up to 1 year|Treatment related AES, up to 1 year|Overall survival (OS), The time from recruitment to death due to any cause., up to 1 year
