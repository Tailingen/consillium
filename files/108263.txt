In this observational study, the feasibility of an at home administration program for carfilzomib will be evaluated in patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma having already received a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 6 full cycles of KRd (carfilzomib - lenalidomide - dexamethasone) in the hospital.

One treatment cycle of KRd consists of a 28-day period. Carfilzomib is administered intravenously as a 10 minute infusion, on two consecutive days, each week for three weeks (days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15 and 16), followed by a 12-day rest period (days 17 - 28). In combination with carfilzomib, lenalidomide is administered orally on days 1-21 and dexamethasone is administered orally on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of the 28-day cycles.

Multiple myeloma is characterized by a recurring pattern of remission and relapse. Given the need for chronic treatment and good adherence, convenience and quality of life of the patients become important factors as well. As the majority of the multiple myeloma patients are elderly and the treatment schedule requires many hospital visits, this treatment schedule may impact the social and familial life of the patient.

If the patient accepts to participate in the home administration program:

* Administration of carfilzomib during cycle 1 and 2 will be performed in the hospital
* During cycle 3 until 6, carfilzomib will be administered on day 1 and15 in the hospital, while there will be home administration on days 2, 8, 9 and 16.
* On day 1 of each cycle, there will be asked to the patient to complete a short questionnaire about the quality of life and patients satisfaction during the home administration program of carfilzomib.

If the patient doesn't accept to participate in the home administration program:

-The patient can agree on one-time collection of data: patient characteristics (date of birth+gender) and reason for refusal to the home administration program.
