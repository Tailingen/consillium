The EORTC QLQ-C30 is composed of 9 multi-item scales: 5 functioning scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional and social), a global QOL scale, and 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain and nausea/vomiting). In addition, several single item symptom measures are used.

For the five functioning scales and the global quality of life scale, a higher score represents a better level of functioning. For the symptom scales and items, a high score corresponds to a higher level of symptomatology., 5 years
