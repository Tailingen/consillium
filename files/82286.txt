Evolution of Vestibular Function After Treatment of a Vestibular Schwannoma by Gamma-knife Radio-surgery
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the vestibular effects of gamma-knife radiosurgery, as part of the treatment of vestibular schwannoma.

Vestibular schwannoma is a benign tumor located on the vestibulocochlear nerve. It represents 6 to 8% of intracranial tumors, 80% of ponto-cerebral angle tumors and its frequency is 13 cases per million inhabitants per year.

The main symptoms related to the development of vestibular schwannoma are unilateral deafness of perception, unilateral tinnitus, unilateral vestibular deficit vertigo, facial paralysis.

Management is divided into 3 options: monitoring, surgery and gamma-knife radiosurgery.

This study will focus on gamma-knife radiosurgery. The objective of this treatment is to stabilize the evolution of schwannoma.

This study aims to describe the vestibular effects of radiosurgery.
