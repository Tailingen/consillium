Adebrelimab Combined With Irinotecan Liposomal (II), Oxaliplatin, and 5-FU/LV Conversion Therapy for Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
This trial is a prospective, single-arm, single-center, phase II clinical study, mainly targeting subjects with locally advanced pancreatic cancer, to explore the efficacy and safety of adebrelimab combined with irinotecan liposome (II), oxaliplatin, and 5-FU/LV conversion in the treatment of locally advanced pancreatic cancer.
Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: Adebrelimab combined with irinotecan liposomal (II), oxaliplatin, and 5-FU/LV
Surgical conversion rate, Refers to the proportion of subjects with successful conversion to all subjects receiving conversion therapy. Achievement of R0/R1 resection after conversion therapy was defined as successful conversion., Up to 6 months
Overall Survival (OS), Time from start of patient treatment to death from any cause, 5 years|1-year OS rate, Proportion of subjects who have survived 1 year from the date of first treatment after enrollment to all treated subjects, 1 year|Objective response rate (ORR), Proportion of subjects including complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), Up to 3 years|Event-free survival (EFS), The EFS endpoint is a composite time-to-event endpoint, and the "treatment failure" event is defined as the earliest occurrence of the following events: a. Failure to achieve local disease-free status after completion of conversion therapy and/or surgery (i.e., failed resection or disease progression resulting in inoperability); b. Local or distant recurrence; c. Death;, Up to 3 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Proportion of subjects whose best response observed throughout the study was CR, PR, or stable disease (SD), Up to 3 years|Duration of response (DoR), From the first tumor response (CR or PR) to disease progression (PD) or death (whichever occurs earlier), Up to 3 years|Time to disease progression (TTP), The time from the date of enrollment to the first observation of PD, Up to 3 years
Treatment-related adverse events, Observe all patients for any adverse events during the clinical study, including abnormalities in clinical symptoms and vital signs, abnormalities in laboratory tests, record their clinical manifestation characteristics, severity, time of occurrence, duration, treatment methods and prognosis, and determine their correlation with the investigational drug., Up to 3 years|CA19-9 Response Rate, Tumor marker response rates were assessed by changes in CA19-9 serum concentrations. Tumor marker response was defined as at least one concentration reduction of at least 50% from baseline occurring during the course of treatment. Only subjects with baseline values greater than the upper detection limit will be included in the evaluation of tumor marker response., Up to 3 years
Subjects enter the screening period after being fully informed and signing an informed consent form. The screening period for the study is 28 days.

After completing the screening inspection and evaluation, patients will receive adebrelimab once and irinotecan liposomal (II), oxaliplatin, 5-FU/LV twice per cycle (4 weeks), and imaging of tumor lesions will be performed every 2 cycles (8 weeks ± 7 days) to evaluate whether patients can undergo surgery until surgical resection, disease progression, or intolerable toxicity, start of new anticancer drug therapy, withdrawal from the study, death, or loss to follow-up.

After 6 cycles of treatment, patients who are assessed to have no progression but are still unable to undergo radical surgical resection will receive maintenance treatment regimen (using capecitabine or teggio plus adebrelimab), and imaging efficacy will be evaluated every 12 weeks (± 7 days) during maintenance treatment. Surgical resectability will still be evaluated during maintenance treatment until disease progression or intolerable toxicity, start of new anticancer drug treatment, withdrawal from the study, death, or loss to follow-up.
