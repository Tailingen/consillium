CyberKnife Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Small Hepatocellular Carcinoma Patients With Decompensated Cirrhosis
The aim of our research is to evaluate the curative effect and safety of CyberKnife stereotactic body radiation therapy in treating small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with decompensated cirrhosis.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
RADIATION: Cyberknife stereotactic body radiation therapy
Overall survival time, OS is calculated starting from the date of SBRT to the date of the final follow-up or demise of the patients., From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 36 months|Progression-free survival time, PFS is estimated starting from the date of SBRT to the date of disease progression or patient death., From date of randomization until the date of disease progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 36 months|Local control time, LC is defined starting from the date of SBRT to the date of treated-lesion progression or patient death., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 36 months
Radiation-induced liver injury rates, From the date of radiotherapy completion until the 4 months after therapy,up to 6 months.|Adverse reaction, From the date of radiotherapy completion until the 4 months after therapy,up to 6 months.
