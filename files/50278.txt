A Study of ABT-888 in Combination With Carboplatin and Gemcitabine in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of veliparib (ABT-888)and to establish the recommended Phase 2 dose of veliparib (ABT-888) when administered in combination with carboplatin and gemcitabine in subjects with advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: veliparib (ABT-888)|DRUG: carboplatin|DRUG: gemcitabine
Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended Phase 2 dose, ABT-888 will be dose escalated until the largest dose is reached based on the probability of dose, limiting toxicities is based per continual reassessment method (CRM).
Pharmacokinetics Area Under the Curve (AUC), Timepoints: 30 and 45 minutes, 1,1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5,6,6.5, 7 and 8 hours past dose|Safety assessment: Electrocardiogram, Screening, Day 8 of each Cycle of drug and Final Visit|Safety assessment: Clinical Laboratory Tests, Hematology and Chemistry, Screening, Day 1 and Day 8 of each cycle, Final Visit and 30 Day Follow-up Visit|Physical exam including vital signs, Physical exam including blood pressure, pulse and temperature, Screening, Cycle 1 Day 8, Day 1 of all cycles starting with Cycle2, Final Visit and 30 Day Follow-up Visit|Safety assessment: Adverse event assessments, Collect all adverse events at each visit, All study visits|Tumor assessment, Computerized tomography (CT) scan of chest, abdomen and pelvis to assess tumor burden, Screening, every nine weeks and Final Visit
