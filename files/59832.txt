Intrathecal Radioimmunotherapy, Radiation Therapy, and Chemotherapy After Surgery in Treating Patients With Medulloblastoma
RATIONALE: Radioimmunotherapy uses radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies to locate tumor cells and deliver radioactive tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining intrathecal radioimmunotherapy and radiation therapy with combination chemotherapy may kill any tumor cells remaining after surgery.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining intrathecal radioimmunotherapy and radiation therapy with combination chemotherapy in treating patients who have undergone surgery for medulloblastoma.

DRUG: cisplatin|DRUG: lomustine|DRUG: vincristine sulfate|PROCEDURE: adjuvant therapy|RADIATION: iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody 3F8|RADIATION: radiation therapy
Feasibility, 2 years|Progression-free Survival, 2 years|Morbidity, 2 years
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the feasibility of combining post-operative intrathecal radioimmunotherapy, craniospinal radiotherapy with intensity-modulated radiotherapy boost, and chemotherapy in patients with standard-risk medulloblastoma.
* Determine whether this regimen can maintain or exceed the current progression-free survival rate while decreasing long-term serious morbidity in these patients.
* Determine the long-term morbidities, most specifically neuropsychological, neuroendocrine, audiometric, and growth outcomes, in patients treated with this regimen.

OUTLINE:

* Radioimmunotherapy: Patients receive intrathecal iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody 3F8 on days 1 and 8.
* Radiotherapy: Beginning as soon as possible after radioimmunotherapy, patients undergo external-beam and intensity-modulated radiotherapy 5 days a week for 6 weeks.
* Chemotherapy: Patients receive vincristine IV once weekly for 8 weeks concurrently with radiotherapy. Beginning about 6 weeks after completion of radiotherapy (4 weeks after vincristine), patients receive cisplatin IV over 6 hours and oral lomustine on day 0 and vincristine IV on days 0, 7, and 14. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 6-20 patients will be accrued for this study within 3.2 years.
