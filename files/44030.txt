Medical Imaging of Cachexia
This is a pilot trial using 18F-FDG PET and DXA scans to determine whether these investigations are objective tools to assess cachexia.
Cancer Cachexia
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: 18F-FDG PET + Dexa Scan
Correlation of a clinical diagnosis of cachexia with the metabolic activity of brown adipose tissue, bone density and muscle mass., Quantitation of the metabolic activity of brown adipose tissue, bone density and muscle mass using 18F-FDG uptake and bone densitometry will be correlated with a diagnosis of clinical cachexia., 7 days post enrollment
Optimization of PET scanning methods for imaging of brown adipose tissue., Optimization of the patient environment (ie. ambient temperature) and metabolic state (ie. Heart rate, dietary state) to minimize the impact of these factors and allow direct comparison of metabolic activity of brown adipose tissue between cachectic and non-cachectic patients., 7 days post enrollment|To quantify change from normal of inflammatory blood biomarkers, To validate change from normal laboratory range of inflammatory blood based proteins and enzymes in cachectic vs non-cachectic patients., 7 days post enrollment|To quantify change from normal of immune blood biomarkers, To validate change from normal laboratory range immune blood based proteins and enzymes in cachectic vs non-cachectic patients., 7 days post enrollment
This pilot study will establish the differences in BAT uptake of 18F-FDG in cachectic and non-cachectic cancer patients using PET imaging.

Patients willbe assessed for sarcopenia using a dual energy X-ray absorptiometry or bone densitometry scan (DXA). Given the variables which may affect uptake of BAT in cancer patients, this study will standardise patient preparation and PET scan procedure in order to obtain the most reliable assessment of BAT activity in all patients on study.

It is hypothesisd that use of this PET imaging technique, which is part of standard care to assess cancer progression, may assist clinicians in early identification of metabolic changes in a patient, with potential for early intervention and utility in monitoring success of treatments of cachexia.

A total of 40 patients will be evaluated, 20 patients with advanced/metastatic colorectal, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or pancreatic cancer without cachexia, and 20 patients with advanced/metastatic colorectal, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), or pancreatic cancer with documented cachexia, all of whom are referred for standard of care 18F-FDG PET scans.
