Vinorelbine in Treating Children With Recurrent or Refractory Cancers
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of vinorelbine in treating children with recurrent or refractory cancer.
Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors|Neuroblastoma|Sarcoma
DRUG: vinorelbine tartrate
Disease progression
OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate of children with recurrent or refractory malignancies treated with vinorelbine. II. Assess the toxic effects of this drug in these children.

OUTLINE: Patients receive vinorelbine IV over 6-10 minutes weekly on weeks 1-6. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks for a total of 10 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 4 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 100 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
