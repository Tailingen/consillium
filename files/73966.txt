Clinical Trial of the Efficacy and Safety of AC0010 in the Treatment of EGFR T790M Patients With Advanded NSCLC
The study is a single-arm, multi-center, open-label clinical trial. The study aims to expand the sample size based on the fixed dose recommended by the results of previous dose exploration studies in order to further evaluate the study drug's efficacy and safety.
Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: AC0010
ORR(Objective Response Rate), To assess the overall objective response rate (ORR) of AC0010 in EGFR T790M mutation-positive patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)., Every 6 weeks from time of first dose until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 12 months.
DoR (Duration of Response), To assess the duration of response (DOR) of AC0010 in EGFR T790M mutation-positive patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)., Every 6 weeks from time of first dose until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 12 months.|PFS (Progression-free survival), To assess the progression-free survival (PFS) of AC0010 in EGFR T790M mutation-positive patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)., Every 6 weeks from time of first dose until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 12 months.|DCR (Disease control rate), To assess the disease control rate (DCR) of AC0010 in EGFR T790M mutation-positive patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)., Every 6 weeks from time of first dose until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 12 months.|OS (Overall survival), To assess the overall survival (OS) of AC0010 in EGFR T790M mutation-positive patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)., Every 6 weeks from time of first dose until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 12 months.|The lung cancer symptoms and health-related quality of life (HRQoL), To assess the safety of AC0010 in EGFR T790M mutation-positive patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)., Every 3 weeks from time of first dose until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months.
The study is a single-arm, multi-center, open-label clinical trial. The study aims to expand the sample size based on the fixed dose recommended by the results of previous dose exploration studies in order to further evaluate the study drug's efficacy and safety with overall objective tumor response rate (ORR) as the primary efficacy evaluation indicator, and further evaluate subjects' duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), disease control rate (DCR), overall survival (OS) and quality of life (QoL). Safety indicators of subjects are further evaluated through adverse events, vital signs and clinical laboratory parameters.
