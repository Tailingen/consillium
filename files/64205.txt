DRUG: Camrelizumab|RADIATION: radiotherapy
1-year disease-free survival rate (1-year DFS), The percentage of subjects who were free of disease recurrence or death from the start of study enrolment to 12 months later., up to approximately 1 year
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), the time from treatment to the first occurrence of disease progression as determined by the investigator with use of RECIST v1.1 or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Patients who have not experienced disease progression or death at the time of analysis will be censored at the time of last tumor assessment., up to approximately 2 year|Disease-free survival (DFS), The time from enrolment (ICF signing) to disease recurrence or death due to disease progression., up to approximately 2 year|Overall survival (OS), the time between subjects' death from various causes.For subjects still alive at the last follow-up, their OS was measured as data deletion by the time of the last follow-up., up to approximately 3 year
