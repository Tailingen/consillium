Field Evaluations of Innovative Tools for Vector-borne Disease Control in Conflict-affected Communities
The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a new spatial repellent (called Mesh) at repelling multiple disease vectors and, reducing clinical malaria rates in temporary shelters and camp settings. The design of the study will be a two-armed cluster randomised trial.

By conducting the research in challenging camp settings in the north of Nigeria, the MENTOR Initiative aims to determine whether Mesh can be effective in harsh camp conditions where communities are living in conflict area temporary shelters.

COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Mesh - spatial repellent impregnated with transfluthrin (2500mg)|BEHAVIORAL: Information and Education Campaigns (IEC)|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: test and treat malaria cases
entomological outcome: vector density, the relative infestation rate of disease vectors (females of any of Anopheles malaria vectors, Aedes aegypti, or phlebotomine sand flies, 7 months|epidemiological outcome: malaria incidence, Malaria incidence will be estimated as the total number of malaria episodes per person over the course of the trial., 7 months
feasibility, acceptance and uptake of Mesh, To measure community and household acceptance and uptake of Mesh, a questionnaire will be conducted with the Mesh-receiving households., 7 months
