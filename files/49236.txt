A Novel Skin Barrier Protectant for Acute Radiodermatitis
Acute radiodermatitis (ARD) is a distressing and painful skin reaction that occurs in 95% of the patients undergoing radiotherapy (RT). To date, there is still no general approved guideline for the prevention and management of acute radiodermatitis. The 3M™ Cavilon™ Advanced Skin Protectant is a novel skin barrier protectant that acts as a physical barrier against abrasion, moisture, and irritants. Moreover, it enables an environment for wound healing. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of 3M™ Cavilon™ Advanced Skin Protectant in the prevention and management of ARD in patients with head and neck cancer.
