Application of Radiomics in the Diagnosis and Treatment Prediction of Pituitary Adenoma
The images of patients with Pituitary adenoma were collected and analyzed based on the methods of radiomics.
Pituitary Adenoma
PROCEDURE: surgery of pituitary adenomas
Recurrence rate of pituitary adenoma, The pituitary adenoma recurred 1 year after treatment. The recurrence was assessed by 3 aspects: (1)contrast enhanced MRI showed suspicious tumor growth, such as bone destruction; (2)signs and symptoms that had disappeared after treatment reappeared, such as pressing on nearby nerve tissue and some characteristic appearance; (3)endocrine indexes rose again after reaching the remission standard, iculding Prolactin(PRL)\>30 Î¼g/L in Lactotroph adenoma; growth hormone (GH)\>2.5ng/ml in Somatotroph adenoma, serum cortisol\>800nmol/L at 8am in Corticotroph adenoma, while other types do not consider endocrine indicators., 1 year after treatment
Pathological type of pituitary adenomas, The pathological examination was used to evaluated the type of pituitary adenoma. The pathological type was assessed by 2017 WHO standard, divided into Somatotroph adenoma, Lactotroph adenoma, Thyrotroph adenoma, Corticotroph adenoma, Gonadotroph adenoma, Null-cell adenoma and Plurihormonal and double adenomas., 1 week after treatment
Inclusion of pituitary adenoma patients diagnosed clinically or pathologically

1. Clinical data and pre-treatment imaging data of included patients (DICOM format)
2. Determine the subtype diagnosis of pituitary adenoma based on the patient's clinical and pathological data
3. Collect relevant data of patients before and after treatment
4. Using radiomics methods, extract radiomic features of patients and construct a radiomic model for predicting the diagnosis and treatment response of pituitary adenomas
