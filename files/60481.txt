MRI - Guided Adaptive RadioTHerapy for Dysphagia in Head and Neck Cancer
Recently developed hybrid machines (MRidian®-CE approval since 2016), consisting of a linear accelerator and an integrated low-field MRI, could allow better visualization of tumor and organs at risk during patient positioning and daily treatment finally repetitive adaptation of target volumes according to changes in patient weight and tumor anatomy during the radiotherapy course. These procedures would facilitate a high-precision treatment and help reduce dose exposure of critical structures.
