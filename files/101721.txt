Effect of Muscle and Skin Fixation of Thoracic Drainage Tube on Postoperative Pain
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Thoracoscopic pulmonary resection is a prevalent management for early stage of lung cancer. Placement of chest tube is the standard procedure after surgery, which causes pain that cannot be ignored. The investigators aimed to determine whether a muscle layer fixation of thoracic drainage tube could release postoperative pain in patients with uniport thoracoscopic pulmonary resection compared with conventional skin fixation.

PROCEDURE: muscle layer fixation of thoracic drainage tube
Postoperative Pain, The postoperative pain is assessed using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS), From date of operation until the date of chest tube removal, assessed up to 7 days|Pain-associated inflammatory factor, the level of pain-associated inflammatory factor in blood, including CRP, PCT, IL6 and TNFa, the first day after surgery|Dosage of analgesics, Dosage of analgesics, From date of operation until the date of chest tube removal, assessed up to 7 days
