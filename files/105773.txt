Cyclophosphamide With or Without Celecoxib in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Persistent Ovarian Epithelial, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Celecoxib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving cyclophosphamide together with celecoxib may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well giving cyclophosphamide together with celecoxib works compared to cyclophosphamide alone in treating patients with recurrent or persistent ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.
Fallopian Tube Cancer|Peritoneal Cavity Cancer|Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial Cancer
DRUG: cyclophosphamide|DRUG: celecoxib
Overall Response, Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR, Up to 3 years|Time to Treatment Failure, Estimated using the product-limit method of Kaplan and Meier. Time to treatment failure is defined as the time from initial treatment to discontinuation of treatment for any reason, including progression of disease, treatment toxicity, and death.

Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., Up to 3 years|Overall Survival, Estimated using the product-limit method of Kaplan and Meier. From time of initial treatment to death from any cause., Up to 5 years
OBJECTIVES:

I. To assess the response rates in patients with recurrent or persistent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are treated with oral cyclophosphamide alone or oral cyclophosphamide with celecoxib.

II. To assess the time to disease progression in this group of patients. III. To further describe the toxicities of oral cyclophosphamide with or without celecoxib in the above patient population.

OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

ARM I: Patients receive oral cyclophosphamide once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

ARM II: Patients receive oral cyclophosphamide once daily and oral celecoxib twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
