Argipressin's Influence on Blood Loss During Hepatic Resection
Infusion of Argipressin during hepatic resection surgery may reduce blood loss. It may also reduce transfusion requirements, and mitigate the perioperative inflammatory response compared to placebo. Subjects will be randomized to infusion of Argipressin or placebo during surgery. Blood loss, transfusion requirements, surgical data including length of stay in hsopital, inflammatory markers and markers of renal- intestinal- and cardiac injury will be assessed. Two sub-studies has been added; one for evaluation of coagulation function, and one for assessment of pain scores and morphine consumption.

Hepatic resection is a major surgical intervention with high risk of substantial blood loss. The surgical means to reduce blood loss may impair perfusion and induce intestinal congestion. If blood flow to the liver can be influenced by pharmacological means, blood loss and transfusion requirements may be reduced. Moreover, the inflammatory system is involved in cancer development, and the anti-inflammatory properties of Argipressin may decrease the inflammatory response after hepatic surgery.

Argipressin is an endogenous substance, and part of the body's response to stress and trauma. Argipressin affects V1-receptors to produce vasoconstriction. It is also involved in inflammatory reactions and affects platelets.

Patients will be stratified according to planned type of surgery (open/laparoscopic) and planned extent of resection, and randomized to etiher infusion of Argipressin or placebo (normal saline) during surgery. In all other aspects, the participants will be treated according to the institution protocol for hepatic resection. The study drug will be started as soon as the central line is placed, and discontinued at the end of surgery. Hemodynamic data will be collected during surgery, and blood and urine-samples will be obtained during and after surgery for analysis of inflammatory markers and markers of organ injury.
