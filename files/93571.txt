Effect of Intravenous Infusion of Lidocaine on Patients Undergoing Radical Resection of Colorectal Tumors
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in the world. Surgical resection is the main treatment option for colorectal cancer patients. Surgery may enhance or accelerate tumor recurrence and metastasis. Multiple factors in the tumor microenvironment play important roles in tumor recurrence and metastasis, and modulating the tumor microenvironment can inhibit disease progression. Lidocaine has been found to inhibit tumor growth in animal experiments.
Colorectal Tumors|Lidocaine
DRUG: Administer 1.5 mg/kg intravenously to the patient before induction of anesthesia, and continue to infuse 1.5 mg/kg/h during the operation until the end of the operation
the concentration of tumor micrometastasis markers were determined by ELISA, the concentration of tumor micrometastasis markers such as CK20 was determined by ELISA, 3 days after surgery
the concentration of stress hormones were determined by ELISA, the concentration of EPI and NE were determined by ELISA, 3 days after surgery|the concentration of inflammatory factor were determined by ELISA, the concentration of IL-6,IL-8,TNF-Î± were determined by ELISA, 3 days after surgery|the concentration of angiogenesis factors were determined by ELISA, the concentration of VEGF was determined by ELISA, 3 days after surgery|the concentration of immune indexes were determined by ELISA, the concentration of B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, NK cells, macrophages were determined by ELISA, 3 days after surgery
Lidocaine was applied in the operation of colorectal tumor patients, and the effect on the postoperative microenvironment and micrometastasis of the patients was observed by detecting the stress, immunity, vascular tumor regeneration, inflammation, etc. of the patients.
