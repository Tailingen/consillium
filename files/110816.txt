PD-L1 Targeting Nanobody Probe for PET Imaging of Solid Tumor
The objective of this study is to construct a noninvasive approach using 68Ga-THP-APN09 PET/CT to detect the PD-L1 expression of tumor lesion in patients with lung cancer, melanoma and other solid tumor to identify patients benefiting from anti-PD-(L)1 treatment.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: 68Ga-THP-APN09
MPR, In the surgical pathology after neo-adjuvant immunotherapy, the proportion of active tumors was less than 10%., After 2-4 cycles of immunotherapy (each cycle is 28 days)
PFS, progression free survival, From date of enrollment until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months.
