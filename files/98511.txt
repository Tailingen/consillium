The purpose of this study is to characterize the molecular and cell biology of the tumor cells in lymphoma.
Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin|Hodgkin's Disease
Collection of tumor tissue to characterize the molecular and cell biology of tumor cells in lymphoma., The study will continue indefinitely.
This research involves the study of lymphoma cells in order to better understand how the disease grows and spreads. This study may lead to the development of special materials that could be used, in the future, to treat lymphoma or to follow the response of lymphoma to treatment.
