ADC-induced Neurotoxicity Treated With Duloxetine
RATIONALE: Duloxetine may lessen peripheral neuropathy caused by chemotherapy. It is not yet known whether duloxetine is effective in treating peripheral neuropathy caused by antibody-drug conjugate.

PURPOSE: This single arm phase II trial is studying duloxetine to see how well it works in treating peripheral neuropathy caused by antibody-drug conjugate in patients with cancer.
Solid Tumour
DRUG: duloxetine
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynecologic Oncology Group-Neurotoxicity subscale, FACT-GOG-NTx scale neurotoxicity score (duloxetine treatment day 0 and 36) (4-point decrease in neurotoxicity score).

The FACT-GOG-NTx scale, is a tool used to assess the symptoms of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). This scale consists of 11 items, each item is scored on a 5-point scale (0=not at all, 4=very much), with a higher total score indicating more severe CIPN symptoms.

In the study, the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) for the FACT-GOG-NTx scale was estimated to be between 1.38 and 3.68, which means that changes within this range are considered to be clinically meaningful.

FACT/GOG-NTx provides a targeted assessment of symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, including sensory, motor, and auditory problems and cold sensitivity., Day0 and Day36

The scale includes both multi-item scales and single items to reflect various aspects of health-related quality of life.

The scale consists of 30 questions measuring the patient's quality of life in terms of five functions (physical, daily living, cognitive, emotional and social), three symptoms (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting), and overall health, overall quality of life, and six other separate items (quality of sleep, appetite, diarrhoea, constipation, respiratory distress, and economic status)., Day0 and Day36|Neurotoxicity score assessed by CTCAE 5.0 scale, Grade 1: asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated

Grade 2: moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age appropriate instrumental activities of daily living

Grade 3: severe or medically significant but not immediately life threatening; hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation indicated; disabling; limiting self care activities of daily living

Grade 4: life threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated, Day0 and Day36
This study is a single arm phase II study. The study consisted of a screening period (subjects signed informed consent up to no more than 28 days before the first treatment of the study), a treatment period (treatment termination was defined as termination of treatment for any reason, such as imaging confirmation of disease progression, intolerance of toxicities despite dose adjustments, or early withdrawal for any reason), and a follow up period (consisting of an end-of-treatment visit, a safety visit, and a survival follow up).
