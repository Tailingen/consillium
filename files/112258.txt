Venetoclax and Azacitidine Combined With Chidamide (VAC) for the Treatment of Newly Diagnosed Acute Monocytic Leukemia
This study is to investigate the therapeutic efficacy and side effect of venetoclax, azacytidine combined with chidamide for newly diagnosed acute monocytic leukemia patients that are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy
Acute Monocytic Leukemia|Newly Diagnosed
DRUG: Chidamide|DRUG: Azacitidine|DRUG: Venetoclax
Composite Complete Remission Rate, The composite complete remission rate(complete remission plus complete remission with incomplete blood cell count recovery), At the end of Cycle 1 or 2 (each cycle is 28 days)|Overall response rate (ORR), The overall response (completed remission without minimal residual disease, completed remission with incomplete blood count recovery, morphologic leukemia-free state and partial remission), At the end of Cycle 1 or 2 (each cycle is 28 days)
Duration of Response (DOR), It is measured the time from initial response to subsequent disease progression or relapse, 1 year|Overall Survival (OS), It is measured from the time of entry into this trial to the date of death from any cause; patients not known to have died at last follow-up are censored on the date they were last known to be alive, 1 year|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), It is measured from the time from randomization to progression or death, 1 year|Adverse reactions in hematology, Record of adverse events in hematological system during and after VEN+AZA+Chidamide regimen induction (agranulocytosis days, PLT/RBC transfusion units), At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Nonhematological adverse reactions, Record of adverse events in other organs or systmes during and after VEN+AZA+Chidamide regimen induction (infection and organ injury), At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is one of the most aggressive blood cancers, with a very low survival rate and few options for patients who are unable to undergo intensive chemotherapy. Venetoclax in combination with hypomethylation agents or cytarabine has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed AML unfit for intensive chemotherapy. However, resistance to venetoclax can be acquired through the upregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins in the BCL2 family, such as myeloid cell leukaemia 1 (MCL1). MCL1 plays a critical role in cell apoptosis regulation and high expression of MCL1 is observed in acute monocytic leukemia (AML-M5) . Chidamide, a newly designed selective histone deacetylase inhibitor, resulted in a decrease in the protein level of MCL1. This study is to investigate the therapeutic efficacy and side effect of venetoclax, azacytidine combined with chidamide for newly diagnosed AML-M5 patients that are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy.
