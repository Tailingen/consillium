CyberKnife for Unresectable Renal Tumors
This is a dose escalation study using the CyberKnife radiotherapy device for small surgical or medically untreatable renal tumors. Patients with renal tumors 5cms or less in diameter will be accrued onto this study. The ability of CyberKnife to ablate these renal tumors and maintain renal function with dose escalation will be assessed.

RADIATION: Stereotactic radiation|DEVICE: CyberKnife Robotic Radiosurgery System
To determine the maximum tolerated dose of CyberKnife radiation, 2 years
To evaluate local control, overall survival and late toxicity including preservation of renal function, 2 years
The CyberKnife Robotic Radiosurgery System is a unique radiosurgical system capable of treating tumors anywhere in the body noninvasively and with sub-millimeter accuracy. The CyberKnife System delivers radiation using a precise targeting methodology allowing a focal treatment margin around the target, thus limiting the volume of adjacent tissue receiving high doses radiation. This in turn allows the delivery of high doses of radiation to the prostate over a short series of treatments.
