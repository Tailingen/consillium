Cyclin D1 as a Prognostic Factor in Multiple Myeloma and Its Association With the Immunological Prognostic Factor PDL1 and Clinical and Biochemical Lab Tests
Multiple myeloma (MM) is the most common bone marrow malignancy of terminally differentiated plasma cells. It accounts for about 1% of all malignant diseases and 10% of haematological malignancies and takes the second place after non-Hodgkin lymphoma .

There are some serological and clinical criteria that help to detect the stage of MM and predict the patients' prognosis. These criteria include the level of M protein, calcium, haemoglobin, albumin, creatinine, β2-microglobulin and glomerular filtration rate (GFR).
