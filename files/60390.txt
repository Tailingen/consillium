A Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of Multiple Treatments in Participants With Multiple Myeloma
CO43923 is a platform study that will evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of multiple treatment combinations, as monotherapy or in combination, in participants with multiple myeloma (MM). The study is designed with the flexibility to open new treatment substudies as new treatments become available. Information regarding the opened substudies are found below.

Cevos + Len substudy(SS) 2 (DIRAC):

This substudy will explore the combination of cevostamab and lenalidomide as post-transplant maintenance therapy in participants with MM with high-risk cytogenetic features who experienced at least a partial response (PR) after induction.

Cevostamab + Iberdomide SS4 (CHAWLA):

This substudy will evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and pharmacodynamics of the combination of cevostamab and iberdomide in participants with R/R MM who have received at least three prior lines of therapy, including a PI, an IMiD, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody.
