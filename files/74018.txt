Early Detection and Intervention for Mild and Moderate Lymphedema in Patients Treated for Breast Cancer
Women who have been treated for breast cancer may be at risk for lymphedema or arm swelling. Currently, there are no clear treatment guidelines for lymphedema. One treatment method used to treat lymphedema is the use of compression sleeves to encourage the flow of lymph fluid out of the arms and prevent arm swelling in the future. Another treatment method is more intensive and involves wearing compression sleeves as well as special compression bandages overnight. It is unclear whether the use of compression with both sleeves and bandaging is more effective in treating lymphedema than the use of compression sleeves alone. The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the use of compression garments in preventing or slowing the progression of lymphedema in breast cancer patients.

To Identify the Number of Patients Who Experienced Reduction in Edema With Compression Garment Usage for Low Volume Lymphedema Associated With Breast Cancer Treatment, Participants who are randomized to receive compression treatment will have their arm volume measured at regular intervals throughout the study period. Participants' arm volume, as measured by the validated Relative Volume Change (RVC) equation, at the end of the intervention period will be assessed to determine the efficacy of the compression garment intervention and whether or not it was successful in reducing the participants' arm edema to RVC\<10%.Data was collected in study participants enrolled in Group 1A and Group 1B only (15 patients total), and the percentage of participants who experienced reduction in edema is reported below., 5 years|To Identify the Number of Patients Who Experienced Reduction in Edema With Compression Garments +/- Night Compression Bandaging for Moderate Volume Lymphedema Due to Breast Cancer Treatment, Participants who are randomized to receive compression treatment with/without night bandaging will have their arm volume measured at regular intervals throughout the study period. Participants' arm volume, as measured by the validated Relative Volume Change (RVC) equation, at the end of the intervention period will be assessed to determine the efficacy of the compression garment intervention and whether or not it was successful in reducing the participants' arm edema to RVC\<10%. Data was collected in participants enrolled in Group 2A and 2B only (8 participants total), and the percentage of participants who experienced reduction in edema is reported below., 5 years|To Assess Survey Response Scores Regarding Symptoms Associated With Varying Degrees of Lymphedema, Symptoms were assessed through the Lymphedema Evaluation Following Treatment of Breast Cancer (LEFT-BC) survey. The responses were scored on a scale from 0-51, where higher score was associated with presence of more symptoms (0=no symptoms, 51 = most symptoms), 5 years|To Assess Survey Response Scores Regarding Fear Avoidance Behavior Associated With Varying Degrees of Lymphedema, Fear avoidance behavior was assessed through the Lymphedema Evaluation Following Treatment of Breast Cancer (LEFT-BC) survey. Participant responses were scored on a scale from 7-28, where higher score was associated with higher level of fear of using arm (7= least fear level; 28= most fear level), 5 years|To Assess Survey Response Scores Regarding Quality of Life as it Associated With Varying Degrees of Lymphedema, Quality of life was assessed through the Lymphedema Evaluation Following Treatment of Breast Cancer (LEFT-BC) survey. Participant responses were scored on a scale from 0-141, where higher score was associated with higher post-operative quality of life (0= worst; 141= best), 5 years|To Assess Survey Response Scores Regarding Upper Extremity Function as it Associated With Varying Degrees of Lymphedema, Upper extremity functions were assessed through the Lymphedema Evaluation Following Treatment of Breast Cancer (LEFT-BC) survey. Participant responses were scored on a scale from 19-95, where higher score was associated with more difficulty utilizing arm for daily activities (19 = least difficulty; 95 = most difficulty), 5 years
To Identify the Number of Patients With Risk Factors Associated With the Onset of Lymphedema That Are Both Related and Unrelated to Treatment for Breast Cancer, Surgical and radiation therapy risk factors for lymphedema (surgery to lymph nodes, radiation to lymph nodes), as well as risk factors unrelated to breast cancer treatment such as high BMI were collected upon medical record review, 5 years|To Evaluate the Number of Patients With Low-level Arm Swelling in Order to Understand the Natural History of Lymphedema After Treatment for Breast Cancer, We recorded the number of participants who had low-level arm swelling, as defined by the Relative Volume Change (RVC) equation of \>5%-\<10%, at the time of their post-operative follow up to determine if women who had low-level arm swelling were more likely to develop lymphedema, 5 years
* Because no one knows which of the study options is best, participant's will be randomized into one of the study groups. Participants with mild lymphedema will be randomized into either Group 1A or Group 1B. Participants with moderate lymphedema will be randomized into either Group 2A or Group 2B.
* All study participants will meet with a lymphedema physical therapist to review daily shoulder range of motion exercises to help minimize their arm swelling. They will be asked to record their range of motion exercises and activities in a study treatment journal. Participants will bring their journal to each study visit (every 4 weeks).
* Group 1A will only be required to meet with the lymphedema physical therapist as described above.
* Group 1B and Group 2A will be fitted with a compression sleeve at their first lymphedema physical therapy visit. They will wear the sleeve for a minimum of 12 hours per day.
* Group 2B will also be fitted with a compression sleeve at their first lymphedema physical therapy visit and will wear the sleeve for a minimum of 12 hours per day. They will also be instructed to wear a short-stretch compression bandage that goes from the top of the hand to the armpit. They will be asked to wear this compression bandage during the night. The overnight compression bandage should be worn for at least 5 nights out of the week.
* Participants will come to the clinic every 4 weeks. The following tests and procedures will be performed: height and weight measurements; review of any side effects; arm volume measurements for both arms; questionnaire.
