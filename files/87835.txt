Risk of Reactivation of Occult Hepatitis B in Cancer Patients During Immunotherapy.
The goal of this observational study is to evalue the cumulative proportion of patients with OBI who do not develop HBsAg seroreversion and/or an increase of serum HBV DNA by at least 1 log above the lower limit of detection of the assay in a patient who had previously undetectable HBsAg and HBV DNA in serum during the study.
Occult Hepatitis B Infection in Cancer Patients
OTHER: Observational: Blood sample of HVB-specific Elispot assay, HBSAg, HBV-DNA
To evaluate the cumulative proportion of patients with OBI who do not develop one seroreversion of HBsAg and/or an increase in serum HBV DNA of at least 1 log above the lower limit of detection of the test in a patient who had previously HBsAg and HBV, Occult hepatitis B (OBI) detectable in serum HBV DNA, negative antigen test surface hepatitis B (HBsAg) and with positivity to anti-HBc (OBI seropositive).

pOBI: Based on the intermittent detection of HBV DNA, we define pOBI (OBI potential) patients with negative HBV-DNA and positivity to anti-HBc., 3 weeks after first cycle of therapy and every 3 months until the end of the study
Evaluation of the incidence of reactivation in patients during immunotherapy, Evaluation of the incidence of reactivation in patients during immunotherapy, 3 weeks after first cycle of therapy and every 3 months until the end of the study|Evaluation of the association between HBV-specific T-cell response and HBV reactivation, Evaluation of the association between HBV-specific T-cell response and HBV reactivation, 3 weeks after first cycle of therapy and every 3 months until the end of the study|Analysis of the incidence of reactivation of HBV in patients with p-OBI according to tumor characteristics (histology and stage) and type and line of treatment (immunotherapy, combined treatment with chemotherapy + immunotherapy)., Analysis of the incidence of reactivation of HBV in patients with p-OBI according to tumor, 3 weeks after first cycle of therapy and every 3 months until the end of the study
The goal of this observational study is to evalue the cumulative proportion of patients with OBI who do not develop HBsAg seroreversion and/or an increase of serum HBV DNA by at least 1 log above the lower limit of detection of the assay in a patient who had previously undetectable HBsAg and HBV DNA in serum during the study.
