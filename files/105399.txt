Open-Label Proof of Concept Study of VP-315 in Basal Cell Carcinoma
This is a 2-part, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation, proof-of-concept study with a safety run-in designed to assess the safety, tolerability, MTD, and objective antitumor efficacy of ascending dose strengths of VP-315 when administered intratumorally to adults with biopsy proven basal cell carcinoma (BCC).

The study is expected to enroll approximately 80 subjects with a histological diagnosis of BCC in at least 1 eligible target lesion (confirmed by punch or shave biopsy).

This is a 2-part, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation, proof-of-concept study with a safety run-in designed to assess the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and objective antitumor efficacy of ascending dose strengths of VP-315 when administered intratumorally to adults with biopsy proven BCC.

The study is expected to enroll approximately 86 subjects with a histological diagnosis of BCC in at least 1 eligible target lesion (confirmed by punch or shave biopsy).

All enrolled subjects will receive VP-315 intradermal injection on an outpatient basis into up to 2 target lesions. In all Parts of the study (1 or 2, as below), each 7-day treatment week comprises up to 3 consecutive treatment days followed by a no-treatment period of at least 4 days. Dosing will commence in a single target lesion. Once a lesion is observed to be fully necrotic (Part 1, Part 2; Cohorts 1-2 only), treatment of that lesion stops, and treatment of subsequent target lesions (up to 2 total) may continue on Day 1 of the following week. In Part 2, Cohorts 4 and 5, treatment of a second target lesion begins on W2D1 (not based on status of necrosis of target lesion 1).
