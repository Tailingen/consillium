A Study of LioCyx in Patient With Recurrent HBV-related HCC Post Liver Transplantation
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represent approximately 70-85% of liver cancer, in which Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the major etiologic agent accounting for at least 80% of HCC in Asian countries. Overall, transplantation remains the best option however, HCC recurrence rate is high among liver transplant patients.

While there are limited treatment measures for HBV-related HCC recurrences, the study hypothesized that LioCyx is capable of lysing target liver cells expressing the HBV cognate antigens and provide clinical benefit to patients with HBV-related HCC.
Recurrent Hepatocellular Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: LioCyx
Safety based on Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious AEs, Review the safety profile of LioCyx by assessing the incidence of AEs and SAEs, Start of Treatment until 28 days post last dose
Overall Response Rate, Tumor assessment will be according to mRECIST. This is based on percentage of participants with Complete Response (CR) and Partial Response (PR) according to mRECIST from baseline., Start of Treatment until first documented CR or PR, assessed up to 62 treatment weeks (protocol-defined treatment duration is until disease progression, death, or loss to follow up, whichever came first)|Overall Survival according to mRECIST, Assess the efficacy following LioCyx in prolonging overall survival of patients in HBV-related HCC patients, Start of Treatment until first protocol-defined PD, and survival follow up until death, assessed up to 62 treatment weeks (protocol-defined treatment duration is until disease progression, death, or loss to follow up, whichever came first)|Quality of life of patients, Compare the quality of life of patients based on \[Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy- Hepatobiliary (FACIT-Hep), version 4\], Baseline to 28 days post treatment (end of treatment)
The study is a Phase I/II, open label, single-arm, multicenter study of LioCyx. Subjects with recurrent hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma who undergone liver transplantation will be enrolled.

Approximately 6-12 subjects will be enrolled in Phase 1 dose regimen exploration, and approximately 60 subjects will be enrolled to characterize the safety and evaluate the efficacy of LioCyx"

All subjects will be followed up for survival until death.
