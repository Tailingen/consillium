Study on Dynamic CtDNA Analysis in Pediatric Soft Tissue Sarcoma
Pediatric soft tissue sarcoma is made up of different subtypes, some of which have distinct genetic alterations. Fusion variants were found in about 43% of bone and soft tissue sarcoma samples. Ewing sarcoma is characterized by recurrent chromosome translocation, with up to 95% of cases showing EWS-ETS translocation. The genetic features of the tumor can change as it spreads or shrinks, and can also be influenced by treatment.

To better understand treatment response and predict relapse early, our study collects liquid samples such as blood, bone marrow, or cerebrospinal fluid at various points during treatment. We then use next-generation sequencing to dynamically monitor the unique genetic profile of the tumor. Additionally, our research may identify new genetic targets and suggest potential treatment options.
