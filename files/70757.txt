Study of A-319 in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory B-cell Lymphoma
Title: A Phase I, Single Centre, Open-label, Dose-escalation Study of A-319 in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory B-cell Lymphoma
Relapsed or Refractory B-cell Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: Recombinant Anti-CD19m-CD3 Antibody Injection
Evaluate the Incidence and Characteristics of SAE of A-319 Treat on Relapsed or Refractory B-cell Lymphoma, Incidence and Characteristics of SAE, At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Evaluate the MTD and DLT of A-319 Treat on Relapsed or Refractory B-cell Lymphoma, dose limited toxicity(DLT), maximum tolerance dose(MTD), At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)
Evaluate the PK(Cmax) of A-319 Treat on Relapsed or Refractory B-cell Lymphoma, Peak Plasma Concentration(Cmax), At the end of Cycle3 (each cycle is 28 days)|Evaluate the PK(AUC) of A-319 Treat on Relapsed or Refractory B-cell Lymphoma, Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve(AUC), At the end of Cycle3 (each cycle is 28 days)|Evaluate the PK(Tmax) of A-319 Treat on Relapsed or Refractory B-cell Lymphoma, time to peak (Tmax), At the end of Cycle3 (each cycle is 28 days)|Evaluate the PK(T1/2) of A-319 Treat on Relapsed or Refractory B-cell Lymphoma, half-life time(T1/2), At the end of Cycle3 (each cycle is 28 days)|Evaluate the PK(CL) of A-319 Treat on Relapsed or Refractory B-cell Lymphoma, clearance(CL), At the end of Cycle3 (each cycle is 28 days)|Evaluate the PK(Vz) of A-319 Treat on Relapsed or Refractory B-cell Lymphoma, volume of distribution(Vz), At the end of Cycle3 (each cycle is 28 days)|Evaluate the PD of A-319 Treat on Relapsed or Refractory B-cell Lymphoma, B-cell level, At the end of Cycle3 (each cycle is 28 days)
