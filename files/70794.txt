ALDH1A1 Expression in Invasive Mammary Carcinoma
ALDH1A1 isozyme oxidizes Retinaldehyde to retinoic acid, which regulates the expression of the genes involved in tumor-initiating stem-like cells, thereby initiating tumor growth and resistance to drugs.

Much emphasis has been focused on ALDH1A1 as a CSC marker. High expression of ALDH1A1 has been reported as a poor prognostic marker in several tumor types and is associated with poor patient outcomes .

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women. it is a heterogenous disease. several factors affect the prognosis of breast cancer. CSCs markers are one of the emerging prognostic biomarkers.
