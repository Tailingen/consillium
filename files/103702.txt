Ningetinib in Advanced NSCLC Skipping Mutations With MET Exon 14 Skipping Mutations
This is a phase II, Single-arm,Open-label Study evaluating the safety and efficacy of CT053PTSA in Advanced Solid Tumors With MET Exon 14 Skipping Mutations
Advanced NSCLC
DRUG: CT053PTSA
Recommended Extended Dose, Recommended dose for expansion phase, Cycle 1Day 1 to Cycle 1 Day 28±3|Objective response rate, Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the percentage of the participants in the analysis population who have a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on RECIST 1.1 by investigators, up to 4 years
Duration of response, Defined as the time from the earliest date of qualifying response until earliest date of disease progression, per RECIST v1.1, or death from any cause, whichever comes first. Includes participants with complete response or partial response, up to 4 years|Progression-free survival, defined as the time from date of randomization until the earliest date of disease progression, as determined by independent central review of objective radiographic disease assessments per RECIST 1.1, or death from any cause, whichever comes first., up to 4 years|Overall survival, Defined as time from date of randomization to date of death due to any cause. OS was calculated using product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) method for censored data., up to 4 years|Disease Control Rate, proportion of patients with best overall response of CR, PR or stable disease (SD), up to 4 years|Adverse events related to CT053, description, timing, grade (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0 \[CTCAE v5.0\]), severity, seriousness, and relatedness, up to 4 years
This study is being carried out in two parts, part 1 and part 2. Part 1:Observation phase of dose tolerance: Objective To observe the tolerability and safety of 60 mg CT053PTSA in advanced NSCLC patients with Metex14 skipping mutation, and to determine the recommended dose (RED) in the dose expansion phase。 Part 2: This is the expansion part and will continue to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CT053PTSA at the dose of RED in advanced NSCLC patients with Metex14 skipping mutation.
