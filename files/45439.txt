A Phase 2, Single-center, Single-arm, Open Label Trial of Vismodegib in Patients With Keratocystic Odontogenic Tumors
The purpose of this study is to determine how well a daily dose of 150 mg of Erivedge (vismodegib) reduces Keratocystic odontogenic tumor (KCOT) size, and to evaluate the safety of this dose. Erivedge is FDA-approved for use in adults with a specific type of skin cancer. However, the drug is experimental for patients with KCOT.

DRUG: vismodegib
KCOT Volume (Greatest Dimension), To evaluate the efficacy of GDC-0449 in reducing KCOT size (shrinkage) in NBCCS-associated KCOT and sporadic KCOT patients following 6 to 12 months of ingestion of 150 mg/day, up to 1 year of treatment and up to 2 years of post- treatment follow-up., Baseline, 6 month (in treatment), 1 year (in treatment), 2 Year (post-treatment), 3 Year (post-treatment)
