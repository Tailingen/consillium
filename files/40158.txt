A Study of Mogamulizumab to Prevent Adult T-cell Leukemia/Lymphoma in People With HTLV-1
The purpose of this study is to find out whether the study drug mogamulizumab is effective in preventing the development of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) in people who are at higher risk for this type of cancer because they are infected with the HTLV-1 virus and because of changes seen in some of their immune system cells called T-cells.

DRUG: Mogamulizumab
Minimum dose and schedule of mogamulizumab to reduce the proviral load by ≥75%, To define the minimum efficacious dose and schedule of mogamulizumab to reduce the proviral load by ≥75% by pre-emptive treatment of HTLV-1 carriers with a limited course of mogamulizumab. The minimum efficacious dose will maintain ≥75% reduction in PVL from baseline levels for a minimum 6 months post completion of preemptive treatment with a limited course of mogamulizumab., 6 months from baseline
