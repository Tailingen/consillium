Influence of Early vs Late SPN on Long-term Quality of Life in ICU Patients After Gastrointestinal Oncological Surgery
BACKGROUND: Nutrition plays a significant role in ICU treatment, and may influence mortality and length of stay in ICU. Enteral route (EN) is preferential to parenteral route (PN) in provision of daily nutritional requirements. When enteral route is insufficient, supplemental parenteral nutrition (SPN) is recommended. Optimal timing of SPN in acute phase of illness remains elusive. ICU patients suffer significant lean body mass loss, in majority, in the first 7-10 days of stay. Optimal provision of protein may prevent muscle wasting. Lean body mass is essential for optimal physical functioning after treatment. Although ICU mortality has been reduced lately, the number of patients going to rehabilitation after ICU stay has tripled. Patients after oncological surgery of the gastrointestinal tract may be threatened with impairment of physical functioning after ICU treatment.

AIM: To compare the influence of early and late supplemental parenteral nutrition on long-term physical functioning in ICU patients after oncological surgery of the gastrointestinal tract.

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, randomised, multi-centre assessor-blinded study. METHODS \& ANALYSIS: Patients will be randomised into intervention group that would receive SPN on first day, and would be continued until 7th day of stay in ICU. Control group would receive SPN on 7th day of stay in ICU, when it is not then already met via enteral route. Physical Component of SF-36 Scale at 6 month after ICU admission will be assessed.
Nutrition Aspect of Cancer
PROCEDURE: Early Supplemental Parenteral Nutrition
Long-term quality of life at 3 months, Long-term quality of life measured in physical component of 36 -SF questionnaire, Physical component of 36 -SF questionnaire at 3 months after admission to ICU|Long-term quality of life at 6 months, Long-term quality of life measured in physical component of 36 -SF questionnaire, Physical component of 36 -SF questionnaire at 6 months after admission to ICU
Enteral route intolerance, Inability to administer up to 60% of protein needs on 3rd day via enteral route, At day 3 since admission to ICU|Thickness of diaphragm, Change from baseline in ultrasound measured thickness of diaphragm, 1st, 3rd, 5th day of ICU stay|Protein delivery, Protein delivery defined as daily input of proteins via SPN, For 7 days since admission to ICU|Energy Intake, Energy delivery defined as daily input of calories via SPN, For 7 days since admission to ICU|Insulin dose, Insulin dose defined as summary daily input of insulin, For 7 days since admission to ICU|Blood glucose profile, Blood glucose profile defined as mean daily glucose level, For 7 days since admission to ICU|Organic phosphorus level, Organic phosphorus level defined as result in blood test performed daily, For 7 days since admission to ICU|Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score ( SOFA score), We will collect data regarding changes from baseline SOFA score - to determine the extent of a person's organ function failure. SOFA scoring system is useful in predicting the clinical outcomes of critically ill patients. Patient can be scored from 0 to 24. If the patient is scored 0 than the patient is in a good state and predicted mortality is low, while 24 is the worst result with expected very high mortality rate., For 28 days since admission to ICU or till discharge|Mechanical Ventilation, Numbers of days of mechanical ventilation, For 28 days since admission to ICU or till discharge|Length of stay in the ICU, Numbers of days of patient stay in ICU, For 28 days since admission to ICU or till discharge|ICU mortality, For 28 days since admission to ICU or till discharge|Hospital mortality, For 28 days since admission to ICU or till discharge|Length of stay in hospital, Numbers of days of patient stay in hospital, For 28 days since admission to ICU or till discharge|Health-care associated infection, New onset of health-care associated infection, For 28 days since admission to ICU or till discharge|Antibiotic-free days, Number of days patient was not given the antibiotics, For 28 days since admission to ICU or till discharge
