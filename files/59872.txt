Microbiota in Urine and Urothelium Can be a Factor for Induction of Urinary Bladder Cancer. The Study Will Examine Urine and Bladder Tissues From Egyptian Male Patients and Controls Using Whole Genomic Sequencing Techniques and 16S rRNA. The Aim is to Elucidate Role of Microbiota in Bladder Cancer.
Microbes inhabiting the urinary tract that are playing an important role in maintenance of health and the development of diseases and bladder cancer. There is correlation between initiation of bladder cancer and microbes. Urine and bladder tissues from healthy individuals and patients with bladder cancer were analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing, results show abundant phylum. Next-generation sequencing technologies will be applied with whole genomic and 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing for microbiota profiling in urine and bladder tissue of male healthy individuals and patients with bladder cancer. Results will lead to prevention, diagnosis, and new treatment strategies for bladder cancer.
Microbiota in Patients With Urinary Bladder Carcinoma in Urine and Cancer Tissues

Bladder cancer:

The total number of studied samples: The study will explore the microbiota in urine and in tissue samples, so every patient with bladder cancer will give (2 samples). The control group will give urine sample ( one samble). Recent research showed that microbiota is detecred in the urothelium of normal undividuals and patients with bladder cancer, this microbiota would differ from urine( liquid) microbiota.

Group III: 11 Normal adults: urine samples from serves as control group of the study.

Total number of participant is 38 individual.

Samples for microbiome analysis:

Samples will be collected in clean leak-proof containers without disinfectant or detergent residue and with tight-fitting leak-proof lids and preserved in a refrigerator until be analyzed at the microbiology laboratory of TBRI.

Urine samples (50 ml) for microbiome analysis will be collected during cystoscopy examination. Samples will be stored at -80 °C until processing.

Tissue and urine samples from patients with bladder cancer: Under standard procedure of diagnostic cystoscopy urine sample will be collected under complete aseptic conditions, patients who has bladder tumor will undergo transurethral resection of bladder tumor, a tissue sample 0.5x0.5 cm will be investigated for microbiome analysis. Samples will be stored at -80 °C until processing. Histopathological diagnosis with Hematoxylin and eosin stain will be done by an expert pathologist for tumor grade and stage according to WHO 22, and EAU guidelines 2023. This procedure will be applied for both non-muscle invasive and muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma. Patients who will undergo radical cystectomy for bladder cancer will be included in the sample size.

Samples for pathological studies:

Tissue samples will be fixed with formalin and examined with hematoxylin and eosin stain.

Clinical Information The urologists will provide adequate tissue samples which is a small part of the whole resected tumor or a part of cystectomy specimens. for pathological evaluation with giving useful clinical information to the pathologist to decide the best approach in handling and processing the surgical specimens and draw up an accurate pathology report.

The urologist will specify:

* Demographic data and clinical history of the patient, history of urinary tract infection and if it was recurrent or sporadic, bladder cytology if present, whether it is the first presentation of the tumor and if not, details of previous management.
* The cystoscopic appearance of bladder mucosa and indicate number, size, location of the tumor/s, the morphological features of the lesion: papillary, solid, or ulcerate.
* The state of remaining mucosa if further biopsies were performed.

Theses information is necessary for a correct evaluation of urothelium and search in microbiome. Because the treatments can have an impact on tumor morphology and on normal looking urothelium.

Bladder Cancer Samples Reporting

* Pathological assessment The pathologist will diagnose if a bladder cancer is present and the type of bladder cancer, by examining cells from the bladder tissue biopsy. Different histological tumor types of bladder cancer will be reported according to the 2016 WHO classification of urinary bladder tumors (Mazzucchelli et al. 2021), modified in 2022.
* Microbiological assessment: Microbial identification methods from Urine and tissue

Sample collection and culture conditions of clinical bacterial isolates:

Detection of a limited number of microorganisms, mainly aerobic and fast-growing bacteria.

Identification of bacterial isolates: The isolates will be identified by culturing on blood, MacConkey agar and sabaruds agar then will be identified by performing biochemical tests, oxidase test mannitol, bile esculin, and catalase test. All isolates will be identified to species level by using Vitek 2 compact system.

2-5 Biochemestry and molecular biology assessment: 16S Metagenomic Sequencing analysis Whole genomic sequencing (WGS) will be applied to all cases, methodology and quality control are according to the genomic and metagenomic center in the children cancer hospital 57357 who are going to perform the WGS and 16S sequencing on urine and tissue samples.

1. DNA isolation from urine and tissue. Urine specimens (50ml) will be thawed and centrifuged at 7500g, 4°C for 10minutes. The pellet will be used for DNA extraction using Invitrogen™ PureLink™ Microbiome DNA Purification Kit, performed according to manufacturer's protocol. To avoid environmental contamination, all isolations from urine samples and from the reagent-only extraction control will be carried out within a PCR hood. Isolated DNA samples will be placed at -20 °C until PCR amplifcation. DNA will be quantifed using DeNovix dsDNA High Sensitivity Assay Kit (Illumina 2013) .

The PCR step adds Index 1 (i7) and Index 2 (i5), sequencing, and common adapters (P5 and P7) required for cluster generation and sequencing. High Sensitivity DNA electrophoresis with the Bioanalyzer system will be done to improve quality control analysis of NGS library. 3- 16S rRNA gene library preparation and MiSeq sequencing. PCR amplification of 16S rDNA, sequencing and analyses will be performed by NGS Illumina MiSeq targeting V3V4 region of bacteria MiSeq Reagent Kit v3 (600-cycle). 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing (16S analysis) is widely used to analyze microbiota with next-generation sequencing technologies. 16S analysis data from the standard V3-V4 primer (V34) sets to optimize the bladder microbiota analysis protocol. 4- Bioinformatics and statistical analyses. The annotated genome is further analyzed using bioinformatic pipelines to gain insights into the pathogen\&#39;s biology and potential for causing disease. It includes:

- Quality control and improvement of the draft genome by removing errors and filling in gaps.

* Annotation of the final genome, including identifying and describing the functions of genes and other features.
* Comparative genomics, which involves comparing the newly sequenced genome to those of related pathogens to identify differences and similarities.
* Functional analysis: this involves identifying the functions of the annotated genes and understanding the pathways and processes they participate in. This can reveal key virulence factors and help to understand the pathogen\&#39;s pathogenesis mechanism.
* Phylogenetic analysis: This involves comparing the newly sequenced genome to those of
* related pathogens to determine evolutionary relationships and track the spread of pathogens in different populations.
* Differences in the overall microbial composition between bladder cancer and healthy
* samples will be assessed. NGS is not available in TBRI, the 16S sequencing and bioinformatics will be done paid in Children Hospital 57357 (they are welcomed to perform the sequencing on a"Paid" principle).
