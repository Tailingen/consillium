Monitoring Response to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Breast Cancer Using Ultrafast DCE-MRI
The study will assess whether changes in kinetic parameters of tumor and peritumoral vasculature using ultrafast dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) during neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) are predictive of pathologic complete response (pCR) in patients with breast cancer appropriate for NAC. pCR is defined as having no residual invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ.

Complete Pathologic Response (pCR), The primary aim of this feasibility study is to determine whether ultrafast dynamic contrasted-enhancement magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) at baseline prior to first cycle neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), after first cycle NAC, and prior to second cycle NAC can accurately predict complete pathologic response (pCR) in women with breast cancer., 6 Months Post Surgery
Image Quality, The second aim of this feasibility study is to determine whether ultrafast dynamic contrasted-enhancement magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) can provide the relatively high resolution, high contrast-noise ration, and good contrast with ultrafast DCE-MRI, 6 Months Post Surgery
