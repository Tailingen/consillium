Vorinostat for Graft vs Host Disease Prevention in Children, Adolescents and Young Adults Undergoing Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplantation
The purpose of this study is to determine the recommended phase 2 dose of the drug Vorinostat in children, adolescents and young adults following allogeneic blood or marrow transplant (BMT) and determine whether the addition of Vorinostat to the standard graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis will reduce the incidence of GVHD.

Phase 1 portion: Determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the drug Vorinostat in children, adolescents, and young adults following allogeneic blood or marrow transplant (BMT)., Real time assessment of safety (DLTs), and pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamics/histone acetylation (PD) analysis in each dose cohort prior to escalation of dose. Dose de/escalation will be determined using the 3+3 up-or-down algorithm., At day +100|Phase 2 portion: Incidence of grade 2-4 acute GVHD within 100 days after transplant, Cumulative incidence will be determined using the proportional hazards method with a corresponding 95% confidence interval. GVHD severity will be determined clinically and graded by using the institutional BMT program clinical practice guidelines. (Pzrepiorka D, Weisdorf D, Martin P, et al. Consensus conference on acute GVHD grading. Bone Marrow Transplantation 1995; 15:825-8.), At day +100
Incidence of Grade 3-4 acute GVHD within 100 days after transplant, Cumulative incidence will be determined using the proportional hazards method with a corresponding 95% confidence interval. GVHD severity will be determined clinically and graded by using the institutional BMT program clinical practice guidelines. (Pzrepiorka D, Weisdorf D, Martin P, et al. Consensus conference on acute GVHD grading. Bone Marrow Transplantation 1995; 15:825-8.), At day +100|Incidence of chronic GVHD, At 1 year|Incidence of relapse, Determined using the proportional hazards method with a corresponding 95% confidence interval., At 1 year|Overall Survival, The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate overall survival, measured from the date of transplantation to either death from any cause or end of follow-up., At 1 year|Relapse-free Survival, At 1 year|GVHD-free relapse-free Survival, At 1 year|Number of participants with adverse events of grade 4 or higher that are probably or definitely related to vorinostat., Graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0, Up to day +100|Percentage of participants with engraftment failure, Engraftment failure will be defined as the inability to achieve an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \> 500/uL within 28 days post-transplant., Up to 28 days post-transplant|Percentage of participants for whom successful administration of at least 60% of the planned doses occurs between day -1 and day +30 post-transplant, Up to 30 days post-transplant|Maximum concentration (Cmax) of Vorinostat, Pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis will be performed using blood samples from subjects who have received at least one dose of vorinostat and for whom quantifiable PK samples are available. Pharmacokinetic variables will be summarized with descriptive statistics., At day +1|Area under the curve (AUC) of Vorinostat, At day +1|Clearance (CL) of Vorinostat, At day +1|Volume (V) of Vorinostat, At day +1
All subjects will undergo allogeneic blood or marrow transplant (BMT) according to local site institutional practice. The preparative regimen will depend upon the subject's underlying disease, type of transplant, previous therapy and comorbidities. Stem cells can be from donors of bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells.
