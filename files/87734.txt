This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. It will randomize patients in a 1:1 ratio to topical cervical treatment with A-007, or placebo gel. Following biopsy confirmation of High Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions (HSIL), women will treat themselves with gel applied to the cervix via an intravaginal applicator. Patients will apply gel once daily for 5 consecutive days of a 28-day cycle for 2 cycles. Women will return to clinic for safety assessments, colposcopy, cytology, and virologic and immunologic testing.
