Study of CD133KDEL Toxin in the Treatment for Solid Tumors
This is a single center, phase I dose escalation study designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of deimmunized CD133KDEL (dCD133KDEL), a ligand-directed, deimmunized pseudomonas toxin against CD133, in patients with advanced, previously treated, refractory solid tumors.
