A Multicenter Clinical Study on the Safety and Efficacy of CAR-T in the Treatment of Relapsed / Refractory Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma
This study is a multicenter, non randomized, single arm, open clinical trial. The selected disease was relapsed / refractory NHL, and the disease was classified into highly aggressive lymphoma, invasive lymphoma and inert lymphoma; Highly invasive NHL included Burkitt lymphoma (BL), lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL), high-grade B-cell lymphoma, etc; Invasive NHL includes diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma and peripheral T-cell lymphoma; Inert NHL contains follicular lymphoma, small lymphocytic lymphoma and marginal zone lymphoma.
Non-hodgkin's Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: Auto CAR-T|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide,Fludarabine|PROCEDURE: Leukapheresis
Safety: Incidence and severity of adverse events, To evaluate the possible adverse events occurred within first one month after CAR-T infusion, including the incidence and severity of symptoms such as cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity, first one month after CAR-T infusion|Efficacy: Remission Rate, Remission Rate including complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR), objective response (ORR = CR + PR), disease stability (SD), disease progression (PD) and unresponsive (NR), 3 months post CAR-T cells infusion
Efficacy:duration of response (DOR), duration of response (DOR), 24 months after CAR-T infusion|Efficacy: progression-free survival (PFS), progression-free survival (PFS) time, 24 months after CAR-T infusion
A single car consists of scFv, hinge region, transmembrane region, costimulatory domain and zeta subunit of CD3.Prior to CAR-T cell infusion, the patients will be subjected to preconditioning treatment. After CAR-T cell infusion, the patients will be evaluated for adverse reactions and efficacy.
