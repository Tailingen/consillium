iSpecimen has built a partner network comprised of supplying institutions that have ethically acquired human biospecimens and created biorepositories/biobanks to store the specimens and data.

Many of these biorepositories have protocols allowing for the collection of their samples but require an additional IRB or ethics review for the distribution of their samples.

This protocol establishes a method of such supply sites to allow their specimens to be distributed and used for research via iSpecimen's technology and network of research clients.
