% of patients with Mchugh grading, The grading made by Mchugh for the classification of outcome with respect to epileptic seizures following epilepsy surgery. It contains a total of 5 levels. The higher the level, the worse the result. We will count the percentage of patients at each level.epileptic seizures following epilepsy surgery. It is used for assessing the control of epilepsy., 4 years

This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) in the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy in patients with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) and compare it with traditional antiepileptic drug therapy. By assessing seizure frequency, severity, and improvements in quality of life, the study seeks to provide evidence-based guidance for clinical treatment strategies.
