SuPr Study (Supine Versus Prone Treatment Position in Breast Radiotherapy)
A randomised, two-arm, non-blinded crossover study investigating the impact of treatment position (prone versus supine) upon reproducibility of tumour bed position in patients undergoing breast radiotherapy following excision of early breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
RADIATION: Imaging investigations (with radiation)
Interfraction reproducibility of tumour bed position (Reproducibility of tumour bed position in supine versus prone positions compared using the difference in mean daily displacement in tumour bed centre of gravity over a course of radiotherapy in 3D)., End of radiotherapy
To establish whether or not the prone (face down) position reduces exposure of healthy tissue to radiation when compared to the supine position. To compare patient comfort and acceptability in each of the prone and supine positions. To perform a time and motion study for radiotherapy planned and delivered in each of the prone and supine positions.
