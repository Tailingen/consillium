Neoadjuvant Targeted Therapy in Patients With Resectable EGFR-mutated Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma
Previous trials, such as ADURA and CTONG, have demonstrated the benefits of neoadjuvant targeted therapy in patient with EGFR mutations , which can effectively reduce the extent of tumors and improve the survival outcomes. However, clinical trials of neoadjuvant targeted therapy in NSCLC have rarely enrolled patients with EGFR-mutated lung squamous cell carcinoma due to its rarity, which means that the safety and feasibility of neoadjuvant osimertinib in patients with resectable stage II-IIIB EGFR-mutated lung squamous cell carcinoma remains controversial.
Lung Cancer|Carcinoma, Squamous Cell
DRUG: Osimertinib
Objective Response Rate, ORR, Defined as the proportion of participants who had a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST version 1.1 after treatment., analysis is completed 4 weeks after neoadjuvant treatment|Safety: frequency of severe adverse events, The frequency of severe adverse events from the participants enrolling to 30 days after the last drug administration or 30 days after surgery., from the participants enrolling to 30 days after the last drug administration or 30 days after surgery.
Major pathologic response, MPR, MPR is defined as the proportion of participants who have achieved major pathologic response (on routine hematoxylin and eosin staining, tumors with no more than 10% viable tumor cells) in all participants who have completed the neoadjuvant therapy before surgery., analysis is completed 4 weeks after surgery|R0 rate, There were no visible tumors in the surgical margin, and the tumor cells in the surgical margin within 1mm were negative under the microscope., analysis is completed 4 weeks after surgery|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the enrollment of the subject to the first determination of disease progression or death of any cause according to RECISTv1.1, whichever occurs first., 2 years|Overall survival (OS), It is defined as the time from enrollment to death of participant due to any cause. In the case of a patient who still survives at the time of analysis, the date of last contact will be taken as the censoring date. In the event of a patient with the survival status unknown, the date when the patient is last known to be alive will be used for interpolation (censoring)., 5 years|Disease control rate (DCR), The proportion of patients whose best overall remission (BOR) is CR, PR or disease stable (SD) according to RECISTv1.1 evaluation, 2 years|Duration of remission (DOR), According to the time from the first recording of objective remission to relapse or death from any cause determined by RECISTv1.1, whichever occurs first., 2 years
This trial aims to investigated the safety and feasibility of neoadjuvant osimertinib in patients with resectable stage II-IIIB EGFR-mutated lung squamous cell carcinoma.
