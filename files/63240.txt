Multicenter Study of Circulating Tumor DNA in Patients With Pancreatic Cancer Using a Personalized Panel
This is a multicenter, prospective, observational study to evaluate the utility of the Invitae Personalized Cancer MonitoringTM assay for patients with resectable and unresectable pancreatic cancer. Using tumor tissue, a personalized blood test (the Invitae Personalized Cancer MonitoringTM test) will be developed that can be used for repeated monitoring to assess for the presence or absence of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). The presence of residual cancer cells after treatment is known as molecular residual disease (MRD) and the detection of ctDNA can provide evidence of the presence of MRD. Participants in this study will have their blood drawn at various time points throughout their cancer treatment to test for ctDNA and monitoring with the Invitae Personalized Cancer MonitoringTM test will continue until disease progression or the duration of the study.

This is a multi-site, prospective, observational trial in Japan of 150 pts with resectable (50) and unresectable (100) PC. The main eligibility criteria are histopathologically diagnosed as adenocarcinoma, no prior treatment for PC, scheduled to undergo surgery for resectable PC or receive systemic therapy for unresectable PC. In resectable PC cohort, blood samples will be collected before surgery and at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months after surgery, and imaging study will be performed before surgery, and at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months after surgery. In the unresectable PC cohort, blood samples will be collected before treatment and at 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, and 48 weeks on treatment, and imaging study will be performed before treatment and every 8 weeks on treatment until 48 weeks. Primary endpoint in the resectable PC cohort is success rate of creating personalized panel using tumor tissue obtained by EUS-FNA/FNB, and that in unresectable PC cohort is rate of concordance of KRAS mutations between tumor tissue and blood samples. Key secondary endpoints in resectable PC cohort are rate of ctDNA positivity for each cancer stage before neoadjuvant chemotherapy and 4 weeks after surgery, and that in unresectable PC cohort is pretreatment ctDNA detection rate for each disease stage.
