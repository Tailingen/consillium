A Phase 1, Dose Escalation Study to Assess the Safety and Tolerability of ASP9853 With Either Docetaxel or Paclitaxel in Patients With Advanced Non-hematologic Malignancies
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability and pharmacokinetics of ASP9853 combined with docetaxel or with paclitaxel in subjects with advanced non-hematologic malignancies.
Pharmacokinetics of ASP9853|Non-hematologic Malignancies
DRUG: ASP9853|DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Paclitaxel
Safety assessed by recording of adverse events, clinical laboratory evaluation, electrocardiograms (ECGs) physical examinations, and vital signs, Duration of study (24 months) to Final Study Visit, up to â‰¥ 30 days after last dose of ASP9853
Pharmacokinetics (PK) Profile for ASP9853: AUC24, AUClast, AUCinf, Cmax, Ctrough, tmax, t1/2, CL/F, and Vz/F, Area under the plasma concentration curve at 24 hours (AUC24), AUC from time zero to time of last measurable concentration (AUClast), AUC with the last concentration extrapolated to infinity (AUCinf), Maximum concentration (Cmax), Trough plasma concentration (Ctrough),Time to attain Cmax (Tmax), Apparent terminal elimination half-life (T1/2), Oral clearance (CL/F), and Volume of distribution during the terminal phase (Vz/F), Parts 1 and 2, Cycle 1, Day 1: Pre-dose and 9 times within the 24 hour period following ASP9853 dosing; Days 8 and 15: pre-dose, Cycles 2 + , Day 1: predose|Pharmacokinetics (PK) Profile for Docetaxel: AUC24, AUClast, AUCinf, Cmax, tmax, t1/2, CL, and Vd ss, Clearance (CL), Distribution volume, steady state (Vd ss), Part 1, Cycle 1, Day 1: Pre-dose and 9 times within the 24 hour period|Pharmacokinetics (PK) Profile for Paclitaxel: AUC24, AUClast, AUCinf, Cmax, tmax, t1/2, CL, and Vd ss, Part 2: Cycle 1: Day 1: Pre-dose and 9 times within the 24 hour period|Objective response rate (ORR), The proportion of subjects with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Criteria Version 1.1, Treatment start to final Study Visit , up to 24 months|Duration of response (DOR), CR or PR response until last study visit at which a tumor assessment or an assessment of clinical disease progression is performed, up to 24 months
This is a two part study. Part 1 will test increasing dose levels of ASP9853 in combination with docetaxel. Part 2 will test increasing doses of ASP9853 combined with paclitaxel. Each part will determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended Phase 2 dose for ASP9853 in combination with each taxane. Preliminary evidence of antitumor activity of ASP9853 in combination with docetaxel or with paclitaxel also will be explored.
