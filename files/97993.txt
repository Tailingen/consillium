Safety and Efficacy of Entospletinib (ENTO [GS-9973]) Combined With Vincristine (VCR) in Adult Participants With Relapsed or Refractory B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL)
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of ENTO with VCR in participants with relapsed or refractory B-cell NHL.
Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
DRUG: Entospletinib|DRUG: Vincristine
Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Laboratory (Lab) Abnormalities Defined as Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory B-cell NHL: Dose Escalation Stage, Occurrence of any of the following toxicities during Cycle 1 was considered DLT if judged by the Investigator to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to the administration of any drug in the treatment regimen:

* Grade 4 (or higher) non-hematologic toxicity
* Grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity lasting ≥ 7 days despite optimal supportive care

  * Note: Grade 3 or higher neuropathy was considered DLT if occurring during Cycle 1 regardless of duration.
* Any Grade 3 non-hematologic laboratory value if:

  * Medical intervention was required to treat the patient, or
  * Abnormality led to hospitalization, or
  * Abnormality persisted for \> 1 week
* Grade 4 Neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count \[ANC\] \< 500 /μL) persisting for \> 14 days or associated with febrile neutropenia
* Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets \< 25,000 cells/μL) persisting for \> 14 days (or \> 25,000 cells/μL, but requiring prophylactic platelet transfusion to maintain this level), Cycle 1 (28-day cycle)
Number of Participants With AEs and Lab Abnormalities Not Defined as DLTs in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory B-cell NHL: Dose Escalation Stage, The number of participants with AEs and lab abnormalities not defined as DLTs in participants in the dose escalation stage with relapsed or refractory B-cell NHL are presented., Cycle 1 (28-day cycle)|Duration of Exposure to ENTO, Baseline to end of study (maximum: 24 weeks)|Number of VCR Doses, Baseline to end of study (maximum: 24 weeks)
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of ENTO with VCR in participants with relapsed or refractory B-cell NHL.
