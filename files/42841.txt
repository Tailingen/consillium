Clincal Study of Reduced Target Radiotherapy in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
To determine whether subtractive radiotherapy can significantly reduce the acute side effects of radiotherapy and improve the quality of life of patients on the basis of ensuring the existing curative effect.
Toxicity Due to Radiotherapy|Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
RADIATION: Target range
incidence of acute mucosal ulcers with a toxicity grade 3 or above, incidence of acute mucosal ulcers (including those in the oral cavity and pharyngeal wall mucosa) with a toxicity grade 3 or above within 6 months after radiotherapy (that is, between the initiation of radiotherapy to 3 months postradiotherapy) among patients with no recurrence in the reduced-target area, up to 6 months
locoregional recurrence-free survival, which was defined as the time from enrollment to the occurrence of locoregional recurrence, with the last tumor assessment date serving as the censoring time in the absence of locoregional recurrence, up to 1 year|Distant metastasis-free survival, The time from date of treatment until date of death due to any cause, assessed up to 1 years., up to 1 years|Overall survival, The time from date of treatment until date of death due to any cause, assessed up to 1 years., up to 1 years|Progress Free Survival, The time from date of treatment until date of death due to any cause, assessed up to 1 years., up to 1 years|Acute radiation toxicity, The injuries after the beginning of radiotherapy include skin, mucosa, pharynx and esophagus, eyes, ears, nervous system, blood system and other organs and tissuesï¼Œassessed up to 3 months., up to 3 months
