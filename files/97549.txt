Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) for Invasive Breast Cancer Patients Not Undergoing Definitive Surgery
This is a prospective pilot study investigating the safety and efficacy of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) as a treatment for breast cancer in patients who do not get surgery. The study will accrue 15 patients who will be treated to a dose of 40 Gy over the course of 5 fractions in the Stony Brook University Hospital Department of Radiation Oncology. The subjects will then have a follow up time of 5 years.
