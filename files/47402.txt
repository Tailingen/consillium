Autologous TAC T Cells Targeting CD19 in R/R Large B-Cell Lymphoma
Phase I/II study to evaluate TAC01-CD19 in subjects with relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphomas. TAC technology is a novel way to genetically modify T cells and to redirect these T cells to target cancer antigens by co-opting the natural T cell receptor. The dose finding portion of this study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of increasing dose levels of TAC01-CD19 to identify a Maximal Tolerated Dose (MTD) or Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D). The dose expansion portion of the study will further evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of TAC01-CD19 at the RP2D.
