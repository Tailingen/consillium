Effect of GnRH Agonist vs GnRH Antagonist on Oocyte Morphology in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Patients During IVF/ICSI
Selection of developmentally competent oocytes enhances IVF efficiency. Usually, oocyte quality is determined based on its nuclear maturation and the presence of specific cytoplasmic and extracytoplasmic morphologic features. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRH Agonists) and gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonists (GnRH Antagonists) are used during controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) protocols in order to prevent premature luteinizing hormone (LH) surge and premature ovulation. However, GnRH receptors are also expressed in extra-pituitary tissues such as ovary, but it is still unknown whether the type of GnRH analogues used during COS could affect the oocyte morphology in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients. The aim of this prospective, non-randomised, open-label, clinical trial is to compare the effects of two pituitary suppression regimens; GnRH Agonist-Long Protocol and GnRH Antagonist-Flexible Protocol on oocyte morphology in PCOS patients during IVF/ICSI.

Prevalence of oocyte dysmorphisms among the studied groups:, Before being subjected to ICSI, the oocytes from both groups will be morphologically analyzed under an inverted microscope; Nikon Eclipse Ti2; in order to detect cytoplasmic and extra-cytoplasmic dysmorphisms., Before oocytes microinjection
Number of oocytes retrieved:, The oocytes will be retrieved by transvaginal ultrasound-guided follicle aspiration 35±2 hours after hCG administration., Immediately after oocyte retrieval (35±2 hours after hCG administration)|Number of Metaphase II Oocytes (MII):, The oocyte maturity will be assessed using Nikon SMZ1500 stereoscope., Within two hours after oocyte retrieval|Number of Metaphase I Oocytes (MI):, The oocyte maturity will be assessed using Nikon SMZ1500 stereoscope., Within two hours after oocyte retrieval|Number of Germinal Vesicle Oocytes (GV):, The oocyte maturity will be assessed using Nikon SMZ1500 stereoscope., Within two hours after oocyte retrieval|Number of Atretic Oocytes:, The oocyte maturity will be assessed using Nikon SMZ1500 stereoscope., Within two hours after oocyte retrieval|Maturation Rate%:, Maturation Rate is calculated by dividing the number of mature (MII) oocytes by the number of retrieved oocytes., Within two hours after oocyte retrieval|Fertilization Rate%:, Fertilization Rate is calculated by dividing the number of obtained zygote (2PN) by the number of injected oocytes., 16-18 hours after microinjection|Cleavage Rate%:, Cleavage rate is calculated by dividing the number of cleavaged embryos by the number of zygotes (2PN)., Day 2 after microinjection|Embryo Quality:, Embryos are assessed using Nikon SMZ1500 stereoscope based on ESHRE criteria (2011)., Day of transfer (2 or 3 days after microinjection)|High Quality Embryos rate%:, High Quality Embryos rate is calculated by dividing the number of high quality embryos (Grade I) by the total number of cleavaged embryos., Day of transfer (2 or 3 days after microinjection)|Biochemical Pregnancy Rate% (Per Embryo Transfer):, Biochemical pregnancy is defined as a positive serum beta-hCG pregnancy test after 2 weeks of embryo transfer. The biochemical pregnancy rate is calculated by dividing the number of women who are biochemically pregnant by the number of women who have at least 1 embryo transferred., 2 weeks after embryo transfer|Clinical Pregnancy Rate% (Per Embryo Transfer):, Clinical pregnancy is defined as the presence of a gestational sac on ultrasound after 3-4 weeks of embryo transfer. The clinical pregnancy rate is calculated as by dividing the number of women who are clinically pregnant divided by the number of women who have at least 1 embryo transferred., 3-4 weeks after embryo transfer
