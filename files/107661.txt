Study of ADCT-402 in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory B-cell Lineage Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (B-ALL)
This study evaluates ADCT-402 in participants with relapsed or refractory B-cell lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Participants will participate in a dose-escalation phase (Part 1) and dose expansion (Part 2). In Part 2, participants will receive the dose level identified in Part 1.
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
DRUG: ADCT-402
Number of Participants Who Experienced Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), A DLT is defined as any of the following events, except those that are clearly due to underlying disease or extraneous causes:

A hematologic DLT is defined as:

- Grade 3 or higher event of neutropenia or thrombocytopenia, or a Grade 4 anemia, with a hypocellular bone marrow lasting for 6 weeks or more after the start of a cycle, in the absence of residual leukemia (i.e., with \<5% blasts). In case of a normocellular bone marrow with \<5% blasts, 8 weeks with ≥Grade 3 pancytopenia will be considered a DLT.

A non-hematologic DLT is defined as:

* Grade 4 tumor lysis syndrome (Grade 3 TLS will not constitute DLT unless it leads to irreversible end-organ damage).

Disease progression is defined as:

* For participants with CR or CRi, the first date of reappearance of blast cells in bone marrow and/or peripheral blood to a level ≥5%, or development of extramedullary disease.
* For participants with PR, the first date of an increase in blast cells in bone marrow and/or peripheral blood such that the patient does not continue to meet the criteria for PR., From 6 days prior to Day 1 of Cycle 3 and 5, and at each subsequent cycle, until discontinuation, assessed up to 12 months after last dose of study drug|Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from the first dose of study drug treatment until the date of death due to any cause., From 6 days prior to Day 1 of Cycle 3 and 5, and at each subsequent cycle, until discontinuation, assessed up to 12 months after last dose of study drug|Progression-free Survival, Progression-free survival is defined among the efficacy population as the time from first dose of study drug until the first date of either disease progression or death due to any cause., From 6 days prior to Day 1 of Cycle 3 and 5, and at each subsequent cycle, until discontinuation, assessed up to 12 months after last dose of study drug|Maximum Observed Serum Concentration (Cmax) for ADCT-402 Administered Every 3 Weeks (Q3W), Cmax for Pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) conjugated antibody (Ab), total Ab and free warhead (SG3199) for the Q3W cohorts., Day 1 (before infusion, end of infusion, and 1, 3 and 6 hours after infusion) and Days 2, 3, 5, 8 and 15 for Cycles 1 and 2|Maximum Observed Serum Concentration (Cmax) for ADCT-402 Administered Every Week (QW), Cmax for Pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) conjugated antibody (Ab), total Ab and free warhead (SG3199) for the QW cohort., Day 1 (before infusion, end of infusion, and 1, 3 and 6 hours after infusion) and Days 2, 3, 5, 8 and 15 for Cycles 1 and 2|Time to Reach the Maximum Serum Concentration (Tmax) for ADCT-402 Administered Every 3 Weeks (Q3W), Tmax for Pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) conjugated antibody (Ab), total Ab and free warhead (SG3199) for the Q3W cohorts., Day 1 (before infusion, end of infusion, and 1, 3 and 6 hours after infusion) and Days 2, 3, 5, 8 and 15 for Cycles 1 and 2|Time to Reach the Maximum Serum Concentration (Tmax) for ADCT-402 Administered Every Week (QW), Tmax for Pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) conjugated antibody (Ab), total Ab and free warhead (SG3199) for the QW cohort., Day 1 (before infusion, end of infusion, and 1, 3 and 6 hours after infusion) and Days 2, 3, 5, 8 and 15 for Cycles 1 and 2|Area Under the Serum Concentration-Time Curve From Time 0 to the Time of the Last Quantifiable Concentration (AUClast) for ADCT-402 Administered Every 3 Weeks (Q3W), AUClast for Pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) conjugated antibody (Ab), total Ab and free warhead (SG3199) for the Q3W cohorts., Day 1 (before infusion, end of infusion, and 1, 3 and 6 hours after infusion) and Days 2, 3, 5, 8 and 15 for Cycles 1 and 2|Area Under the Serum Concentration-Time Curve From Time 0 to the Time of the Last Quantifiable Concentration (AUClast) for ADCT-402 Administered Every Week (QW), AUClast for Pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) conjugated antibody (Ab), total Ab and free warhead (SG3199) for the QW cohort., Day 1 (before infusion, end of infusion, and 1, 3 and 6 hours after infusion) and Days 2, 3, 5, 8 and 15 for Cycles 1 and 2|Area Under the Serum Concentration-time Curve From Time 0 to Infinity (AUC∞) for ADCT-402 Administered Every 3 Weeks (Q3W), AUC∞ for Pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) conjugated antibody (Ab), total Ab and free warhead (SG3199) for the Q3W cohorts., Day 1 (before infusion, end of infusion, and 1, 3 and 6 hours after infusion) and Days 2, 3, 5, 8 and 15 for Cycles 1 and 2|Area Under the Serum Concentration-time Curve From Time 0 to Infinity (AUC∞) for ADCT-402 Administered Weekly (QW), AUC∞ for Pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) conjugated antibody (Ab), total Ab and free warhead (SG3199) for the QW cohort., Day 1 (before infusion, end of infusion, and 1, 3 and 6 hours after infusion) and Days 2, 3, 5, 8 and 15 for Cycles 1 and 2|Area Under the Serum Concentration-time Curve From Time 0 to the End of the Dosing Interval (AUC0-tau) for ADCT-402 Administered Every 3 Weeks (Q3W), AUCtau for Pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) conjugated antibody (Ab), total Ab and free warhead (SG3199) for the Q3W cohorts., Day 1 (before infusion, end of infusion, and 1, 3 and 6 hours after infusion) and Days 2, 3, 5, 8 and 15 for Cycles 1 and 2|Area Under the Serum Concentration-time Curve From Time 0 to the End of the Dosing Interval (AUC0-tau) for ADCT-402 Administered Every Week (QW), AUCtau for Pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) conjugated antibody (Ab), total Ab and free warhead (SG3199) for the QW cohort., Day 1 (before infusion, end of infusion, and 1, 3 and 6 hours after infusion) and Days 2, 3, 5, 8 and 15 for Cycles 1 and 2|Accumulation Index (AI) for ADCT-402 Administered Every 3 Weeks (Q3W), AI for Pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) conjugated antibody (Ab), total Ab and free warhead (SG3199) for the Q3W cohorts.

Study ADCT-402-102 is the first clinical study with ADCT-402 in participants with B-cell lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL).

ADCT-402 is an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) composed of a humanized antibody directed against human cluster of differentiation 19 (CD19), stochastically conjugated via a valine-alanine cleavable, maleimide linker to a pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer cytotoxin.

The study will be conducted in 2 parts. In Part 1 (dose escalation) participants will receive an infusion of ADCT-402 either on weekly administration or every 3-week administration. participants on weekly administration will receive an infusion of ADCT-402 on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 3 week treatment cycle. Participants on 3-week administration will receive an infusion of ADCT-402 on Day 1, every 3 weeks. Dose escalation will continue until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.

In Part 2 (expansion), all participants will be assigned to the recommended dose and/or schedule of ADCT-402 identified in Part 1 by the Dose Escalation Steering Committee.

For each patient, the study will include a screening period (up to 28 days), a treatment period (until withdrawal), and a follow-up period to assess disease progression and survival for up to 12 months after the last dose of study drug. The total study duration will be dependent on overall patient tolerability to the study drug and response to treatment. It is anticipated that the duration of the entire study (Parts 1 and 2) could be approximately 3 years from first patient treated to last patient completed.
