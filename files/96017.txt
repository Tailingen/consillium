Radiation Therapy Followed by Intrathecal Trastuzumab/Pertuzumab in HER2+ Breast Leptomeningeal Disease
The purpose of this study is to find out if radiation therapy followed by intrathecal trastuzumab and pertuzumab is safe and will result in improved survival in HER2 positive breast cancer which has metastasized to the leptomeninges.

Phase 1: Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Intrathecal (IT) pertuzumab in combination with IT trastuzumab, MTD will be determined by testing increasing doses or pertuzumab beginning at 10 mg increasing to 20 mg, 40 mg and 80 mg, along with a fixed dose of 80 mg Trastuzumab., Up to 12 weeks per dosing cohort|Phase 2: Overall Survival (OS), 1 year Overall Survival (OS), defined as the time between the date of study enrollment and the date of death due to any cause., 1 year after study enrollment
Response Rate, All patients included in the study will be assessed for response to treatment. Each patient will be assigned one of the following categories: 1) Complete Response,2) Partial Response, 3) Stable Disease, 4) Progressive Disease, 5) Early death due to disease, 6) Early death due to toxicity 7)Early death due to unknown cause. Participants in categories 4 through 6 would be considered as failing to respond to treatment., Up to 1 year|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS measured from the date of first treatment to the date of first observation of Progressive Disease (PD), nonreversible neurologic progression, or death due to any cause, Up to 1 year
The study is designed as a prospective, single-arm, nonrandomized, open-label, phase I/II trial of radiation therapy (RT) followed by intrathecal (IT) trastuzumab/pertuzumab in the management of HER2+ breast leptomeningeal disease (LMD). Treatment will be initiated with RT, whole brain RT (WBRT) and/or focal brain/spine RT followed by IT trastuzumab/pertuzumab.
