Quantitative Versus Qualitative Fecal Immunochemical Tests (FIT) to Prioritize Urgency of Colonoscopy Referral
The main aim of this study is to determine whether there is a difference in time to diagnosis of advanced colorectal neoplasms using quantitative Fecal Immunochemical Tests (FIT) to prioritize referral for colonoscopy (intervention) compared to usual care (qualitative FIT and appointment-based referral).
Colorectal Cancer
OTHER: Qualitative fecal immunochemical test|OTHER: Quantitative fecal immunochemical test|PROCEDURE: Colonoscopy|OTHER: Cost analysis|OTHER: Anxiety scores|OTHER: Patient satisfaction scores
Time to diagnosis of advanced colorectal neoplasms, Measured as number of days from the time of enrolment until histological diagnosis of a colorectal neoplasm, 40-90 days from the time of enrolment
Analysis of screening costs, Total costs incurred as a result of the screening process, Up to 90 days following enrolment|Patient anxiety levels, As measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Up to 90 days after enrolment
It is hypothesized that quantitative FIT will enable faster detection of advanced neoplasms compared to qualitative FIT.
