CHROENDOHNPCC: Early Detection of Pre-cancer Lesions in Adults With Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer Syndrome
The aim of the study is to test the hypothesis that a chromoscopy colonoscopy is able to increase by 50 % the number of pre-cancer lesions or early cancer detected in patients with HNPCC syndrome, compared to a routine colonoscopy without chromoscopy.
Colorectal Neoplasms, Hereditary Nonpolyposis
PROCEDURE: Colonoscopy with chromoscopy
Number of pre-cancer lesions or early cancer detected., during the procedure
Anatomopathologic criteria (size of lesions, â€¦)., during the procedure
Patient with HNPCC syndrome confirmed by a mutation (MLH1, MSH2, MHS1) are involved in the study. Patient have 2 colonoscopy back to back. The second coloscopy is associated to chromoscopy with carmin indigo. Endoscopist are randomised for the colonoscopy with chromoscopy and are un-awarded of the result of the first colonoscopy. Histopathology of the polyp are noted. The follow up were 1 month.
