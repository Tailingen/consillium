A Pancreatic Cancer Screening Study in Individuals With New-Onset or Deteriorating Diabetes Mellitus
The main goal of this study is to explore the relationship between new-onset diabetes mellitus/deteriorating diabetes and a subsequent diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Magnetic cholangiopancreatography (MRI/MRCP) will be utilized to screen for early stage pancreatic cancer or precursor lesions. Participants will be asked to donate a blood sample at specific intervals for the creation of a bio-bank necessary for the development of a blood based screening test for pancreatic cancer.

Early Stage Pancreatic Cancer or Precursor Lesions, Determine incidence of pancreatic cancer or precursor lesions in individuals with new-onset diabetes mellitus or deteriorating diabetes, Through study completion, up to 3 years
Relative Risk of Pancreatic Cancer Among Individuals with New-Onset Diabetes, Assess utility of MRI as a screening tool for pancreatic cancer and ascertain relative risk of pancreatic cancer in study population of individuals with new-onset diabetes compared to a normal population of the same age, Through study completion, up to 3 years|Relative Risk of Pancreatic Cancer Among Individuals with Detiorating diabetes, Assess utility of MRI as a screening tool for pancreatic cancer and ascertain relative risk of pancreatic cancer in study population of individuals with deteriorating diabetes compared to a normal population of the same age, Through study completion, up to 3 years
Individuals over 50 years of age who have developed new-onset diabetes mellitus (diagnosed within the past 12 months) or deteriorating diabetes will be recruited through the offices of primary care physicians and endocrinologists. Those meeting initial criteria will meet with a research APRN and will undergo a secondary screen to determine eligibility. Individuals enrolled in the study will undergo a five-minute psychological survey and donation of a blood sample for bio-bank analysis every 6 months for 3 years. MRI will be performed at baseline. Any abnormalities on MRI will be reviewed by a multi-disciplinary tumor board and discussed with the participant. Additional MRI will be performed on case-by-case basis
