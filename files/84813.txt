Roll-over Study to Continue Treatment With the Investigational Drug Rogaratinib and to Further Test Its Safety
The purpose of this study is to enable patients, who are currently receiving rogaratinib in a Bayer-sponsored clinical trial (incl. NCT01976741), to continue treatment after their respective study has been closed. Another aim is to learn if rogaratinib is safe and how it affects the body.

Rogaratinib is an investigational drug that may treat different types of cancer, incl. non-small-cell lung cancer, small-cell lung cancer, urothelial carcinoma, head, neck and breast cancer. The drug may stop the growth of cancer cells by targeting different cell proteins called fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR) that are needed for the survival of the cancer cells.
