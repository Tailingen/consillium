A Phase 1-2 Study of CF102 in Patients With Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This trial will test the safety and efficacy of CF102 in patients with advanced liver cancer. Successive groups of patients will be given higher doses of CF102 by mouth on a twice-daily basis. Treatment will be assessed for adverse effects and for effects on the tumor.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: CF102
Dose Limiting Toxicity, Dose-limiting toxicity was defined as a clinically significant AE or laboratory abnormality occurring in Cycle 1, From start of treatment until Day 28 of Cycle 1|Maximum Tolerated Dose, The MTD was defined as the highest dose level at which \< 2 of 6 patients developed Cycle 1 DLT., first 28 days (Cycle 1)|Maximum Plasma Concentration of CF102 (Cmax), Blood samples were collected and plasma concentrations determined using a high-pressure liquid chromatography method., Dose Escalation Phase on Day 1 and Day 29 pre-dose and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 hours post-dose
Number of Subjects With Objective Tumor Response, Therapeutic effect of CF102 in hepatocellular carcinoma measured by number of subjects with objective tumor response, 6 months|Relationship Between Biomarkers of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell (PBMC) Adenosine A3 Receptor (A3AR) Expression and Clinical Effects of CF102, The Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) were to be collected at Baseline and Day 28 in order to evaluate the Adenosine A3 receptor (A3AR) and PBMC biomarkers, and clinical effects of CF102., Baseline to Day 28
This is a multicenter, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation study, to be conducted in 2 phases: a dose-escalation phase, to determine the MTD of CF102 and to evaluate its safety/tolerability, PK, pharmacodynamic, and preliminary clinical activity; and a dose-confirmation phase, which will be a cohort expansion at or below the MTD (ie, the RP2D) of CF102. Subjects will be treated with oral doses of CF102 in consecutive, 28-day cycles. The initial dose of CF102 will be 1 mg twice daily (BID), with subsequent escalations to 5 and 25 mg BID, unless limited by toxicity. Subjects will be evaluated weekly for the first cycle, every 2 weeks for Cycles 2 and 3, and at the end of each subsequent cycle, up to 6 cycles of CF102 treatment. Subjects will return for a follow-up visit 28 days after completion of the last dose of study drug.
