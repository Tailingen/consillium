High-Fermented Food Intervention Among Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer Patients (The FEED Trial)
The purpose of the study is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a dietary intervention (FEED-FF) that includes fermented foods (FF), among locally advanced rectal cancer patients and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, and to explore whether this diet can improve outcomes in rectal cancer patients receiving chemoradiation and NSCLC patients receiving immunotherapy.
Rectal Cancer|Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
OTHER: FEED-FF|OTHER: Standard of Care (SUC)
Effects of the FEED-FF diet on clinical response to chemoradiation (Rectal Cancer Patients), Clinical response measured in clinic by MRI/Endoscopy/Digital rectal exam, comparing the FEED-FF arm to SUC arm.

Indicators of clinical response are Complete Response, Near Complete Response, Incomplete Response, or Progressive Disease., At Baseline and Up to 12.5 Weeks|Effects of the FEED-FF diet on clinical response to immunotherapy (Lung Cancer Patients), Clinical benefit to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy will be measured in clinic by MRI/Endoscopy, comparing the FEED-FF arm to SUC arm.

Defined as the best response of complete tumor resolution (CR), Partial Response (PR), and stable tumor size (SD) within 12 months.

Progressive Disease (PD) within 12 months indicates no clinical benefit., At Baseline and Up to 12.5 Weeks|Effects of FEED-FF diet on the gut microbiome, Measured by fecal biospecimen sample collection; FEED-FF arm hypothesized to demonstrate increases in short chain fatty acid (SCFA) producing bacteria and higher alpha diversity compared to SUC arm., At Baseline, Week 6.5 and Up to 12.5 Weeks|Effects of FEED-FF diet on local immune-related biomarkers, Measured by FFPE tissue slides; FEED-FF arm hypothesized to demonstrate enhanced immune response such as higher T-cell expression compared to SUC arm., At Baseline and Up to 12.5 Weeks|Effects of FEED-FF diet on quality of life, Measured by using the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life (QoL) Survey; FEED-FF arm hypothesized to demonstrate more favorable QoL compared to SUC arm., At Baseline, Week 6.5 and Up to 12.5 Weeks|Efficacy of the FEED-FF intervention, Measured by an accrual rate of 50% of eligible patients, fermented foods (FF) intake of at least 3 servings on at least 80% of days, and at least 80% of intervention group reporting high/very high satisfaction with intervention.

Weekly goal adherence via randomly administered food logs, tracking responses to and general completion of an exit survey will be utilized., At Baseline, Week 6.5 and Up to 12.5 Weeks|Feasibility of the FEED-FF intervention, Measured by an accrual rate of 50% of eligible patients, fermented foods (FF) intake of at least 3 servings on at least 80% of days, and at least 80% of intervention group reporting high/very high satisfaction with intervention.
