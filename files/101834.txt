Preoperative Arterial Embolization Before Oncologic Esophagectomy as a Technique for Ischemic Gastric Conditioning
This retrospective monocentric comparative study aims to assess the efficacy of preoperative ischemic conditioning, in preventing anastomotic leakage in esophageal cancer surgery. Two groups were included : a surgery-alone group (control group) and a PreopAE group (study group) treated with an embolization procedure before esophagectomy. Collected data included patient characteristics, embolization procedure details, surgical outcomes, and postoperative complications.

The primary outcome was the efficacy of preoperative ischemic conditioning in preventing anastomotic leakage, assessed through CT scans. Secondary outcomes included analyzing safety of ischemic gastric conditioning, hypertrophy of the gastroepiploic artery in embolized patients and comparing hospital stay length and postoperative mortality.
