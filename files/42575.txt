Efficacy and Safety of ATX01 in Adult Patients With CIPN (Chemotherapy-induced Peripheral Neuropathy)
The purpose of this clinical trial is to compare the efficacy of twice daily applications of ATX01 (10% \& 15%) versus placebo during a 12-week treatment period in treating chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) in adult cancer survivor patients.
