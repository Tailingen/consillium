Study to Evaluate the Safety and Tolerability of CNTX-4975 in Subjects With Painful Intermetatarsal Neuroma (Morton's Neuroma)
The purpose of this study is to confirm that the local anesthetic applied to subjects with Morton's Neuroma satisfactorily mitigates procedure pain and ensures that post-procedure discomfort or pain will not result in bias or breaking of the blind in the planned Phase 2b study.
