HI: hemoglobin \< 11 g/dL (erythroid); platelet \< 100,000/mL; neutrophils \< 1,000/mL., Up to 1.5 years after the last participant enrolled|Phase II: Number of Participants With Cytogenic Response - as Per International Working Group (IWG) Response Criteria 2000 (Major/Minor) and IWG 2006 (Complete/Partial), IWG 2000 - Major: disappearance of cytogenetic abnormality; Minor: 50% or more reduction in abnormal metaphases. IWG 2006 - Complete: disappearance of the chromosomal abnormality without appearance of new ones; Partial: At least 50% reduction of the chromosomal abnormality., Up to 1.5 years after the last participant enrolled
This is an open-label (both physician and patient know the name and dosage of drug), multi-center study. This study consists of two parts, Phase I and Phase II. In Phase I, approximately 9 participants will be enrolled ie, 3 participants for dose level 1 (15 mg/m2 of JNJ-30979754) and 6 participants for dose level 2 (20 mg/m2 of JNJ-30979754). Once the tolerability of 20 mg/m2 is confirmed additional 30 participants will be included to receive 20 mg/m2 and approximate total participants in Phase II will be 36. This study will include screening period (within 14 days prior to the day of initial administration of Cycle 1) and dosing period (1 cycle consists of administration of study medication for first 5 consecutive days + rested for 23 days; ie, total 28 days). Cycles will be reapeated in participants in whom decitabine was expected to be effective. Safety evaluations will include assessment of adverse events, vital signs, body weight, clinical laboratory tests: hematology, blood biochemistry and urinalysis, cardiopulmonary function tests: ECG, chest X ray and oximeter analysis.
