Moreover, the most appropriate screening test for HSIL(AIN) in this group of patients will be determined. It will be effectuated by performing two kinds of tests: hrHPV test for the 14 most common oncogenic HPV types and the liquid cytology from both the lower genital tract and anal canal with subsequent high resolution anoscopy (HRA) with potential biopsy/excision of suspected lesions and histopathological examination.
