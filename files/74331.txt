Comparison of Bioactive Glass and Beta-Tricalcium Phosphate as Bone Graft Substitute
This study is designed to perform a head-to-head comparison of two synthetic ceramic bone graft substitutes, bioactive glass (BAG) and beta-tricalcium phosphate (TCP), in filling of contained bone defects following surgical evacuation of benign bone tumor or tumor-like conditions. Based on the investigators' previous preclinical research and an ongoing single-center randomized clinical trial on bioactive glass filling, the investigators expect BAG filling to be more efficient compared to TCP in promotion of defect healing and functional recovery after surgery.

This study is designed to perform a head-to-head comparison of two synthetic ceramic bone graft substitutes, bioactive glass (BAG) and beta-tricalcium phosphate (TCP), in filling of contained bone defects following surgical evacuation of benign bone tumor or tumor-like conditions. Small metacarpal and phalangeal enchondromas (Stratum I) and large long-bone lesions (Stratum II) will be evaluated separately. Aside with the head-to-head comparison of the two synthetic bone graft substitutes, autologous bone graft (Stratum I) and allogeneic bone graft (Stratum II) will be used as the standard of care controls.
