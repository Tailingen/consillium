Phase Ib Pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of alpelisib and tucatinib, Plasma concentrations of alpelisib and tucatinib measured at cycle 1 day 15 of therapy, 10 Months|Phase Ib Tumor response evaluation, CR, PR, or SD according to RECIST 1.1 (for subjects with CNS disease by RECIST 1.1 and RANO-BM); assessment of ORR (CR and PR), CBR (CR, PR and SD), 10 Months|Phase Ib Duration of Response (DOR), Duration of response defined as the time from enrollment into clinical trial until objective tumor progression or death whichever occurs first., 10 months|Phase II Tumor response evaluation, CR, PR, or SD according to RECIST 1.1 (for subjects with CNS disease by RECIST 1.1 and RANO-BM); assessment of ORR (CR and PR), CBR (CR, PR and SD), 20 months|Phase II Incidence, nature and severity of all AEs that occur on or after C1D1 of therapy, Safety and tolerability of the combination therapy, 20 months|Phase II Duration of Reponse (DOR), duration of response (DOR) defined as the time from enrollment into clinical trial until objective tumor progression or death whichever occurs first., 20 months
This study is a multicenter, single arm, open-label, run-in phase Ib safety cohort with immediate roll over to a phase II clinical trial that will test the combination therapy of tucatinib with alpelisib in subjects with PIK3CA-mutant HER2+ locally advanced unresectable or metastatic breast cancer. Patients with PIK3CA-mutant HR-/HER2+ and HR+/HER2+ breast cancer may enroll, the latter cohort will receive concomitant treatment with standard doses of fulvestrant to block HR signaling. In phase Ib part, we will confirm the tolerability of tucatinib and alpelisib combination and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). In phase II part, we will expand the testing of this drug combination at MTD to determine the PFS rate.
