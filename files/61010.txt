Collecting Blood and Tissue Sample Donations for Research for HIV/AIDS-Related Cancers
This study collects blood and tissue samples for research of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related cancers. Collecting blood and tissue samples and studying biomarkers in the laboratory may help doctors to learn how are biologic or genetic factors related to HIV and cancers that occur commonly in people living with HIV.

PROCEDURE: Biospecimen Collection
Number of biospecimens collected, The number of blood and tissue specimens will be counted., Through study completion, anticipated to be 10 years
This study is collecting blood and tissue samples (biospecimens) from people living with HIV, who are participating in an AIDS Malignancy Consortium (AMC) clinical trial. Biospecimens are also collected from people who are not living with HIV, but who have a type of cancer that is common in persons living with HIV. The National Cancer Institute created the AIDS and Cancer Specimen Resource (ACSR), a place where these tissue samples are stored, so researchers can learn more about how to treat HIV and related diseases. The AMC works with the AIDS and Cancer Specimen Resource (ACSR) to collect donated samples from people living with HIV or who have cancers that are associated with HIV for future research studies. People who do not take part in an AMC clinical trial can donate samples to the ACSR.

Individuals who agree to participate will be asked to donate blood once. Their blood will be stored in a biobank, and used for research. Individuals may also donate tissue - either from a previous procedure, or from an upcoming procedure.
