EXtendedAnalysis for Cancer Treatment
The purpose of this study is to prospectively validate treatment benefit of an individualized treatment concept based on molecular profiling (MP) from paraffin-embedded tumor tissue sections obtained before the start of treatment (real time biopsy).
Malignant Solid Tumor
OTHER: individual therapy
Use of real time biopsy to establish an individual molecular profile by using next generation sequencing, pathological examination (includes genetic and target expression profiling, and drug sensitivity screening) to rank treatment options and the potential correlation between treatment response and progression free survival, 2 years
The treatment concept will be considered to be of clinical benefit for the individual patient if a progression-free survival (PFS) ratio (PFS on MP-based therapy / best PFS achieved by prior therapy) will be \> 1.0 thus generating a patient cohort with this very property. Thereby, the null hypothesis (that â‰¤ 40 % of this patient population would have a PFS ratio of \> 1.0) will be evaluated with each patient being his own control. For tumor types with high numbers of patients per cohort, the overall response rate (ORR) will be evaluated.
