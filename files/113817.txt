Immune Monitoring Protocol in Men With Prostate Cancer Enrolled in a Clinical Trial of Sipuleucel-T
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immune response induced by sipuleucel-T (ProvengeÂ®).
Prostate Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Sipuleucel-T
The Percentage of Subjects Who Exhibit Any Immune Response at Any Post-treatment Time Point (6, 10, 14, 26, 39, and 52 Weeks After the First Infusion of Sipuleucel-T)., The primary immune response analysis population will include all subjects who receive all 3 infusions of sipuleucel-T. The primary analysis will measure the percentage of subjects who exhibit any immune response at any post-treatment time point (6, 10, 14, 26, 39, and 52 weeks after the first infusion of sipuleucel-T)., Each subjects was to be followed for approximately 52 weeks beginning with the date of the subject's first infusion of siupleucel-T.
Subjects will receive sipuleucel-T, and potentially other medications, as part of the clinical trial in which they are concurrently enrolled. For this study, cellular and humoral immune responses will be assessed. No additional study treatments will be conducted beyond what is required for the subject's concurrent clinical trial.
