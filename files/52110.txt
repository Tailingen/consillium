A Study of Vobramitamab Duocarmazine in Participants With Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer and Other Solid Tumors
Study CP-MGC018-03 is an open-label, two-part, Phase 2 study. Part 1 of the study will enroll participants with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) previously treated with one prior androgen receptor axis-targeted therapy (ARAT). ARAT includes abiraterone, enzalutamide, or apalutamide.

Participants may have received up to 1 prior docetaxel-containing regimen, but no other chemotherapy agents.

This part of the study will assess the efficacy and tolerability of vobramitamab duocarmazine (MGC018) in two experimental arms (2.0 mg/kg every 4 weeks \[Q4W\] and 2.7 mg/kg Q4W) . Approximately 100 participants will be randomized 1:1.

Part 2 of the study will enroll participants with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Participants must have progressive following at least 1 prior line of standard chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic disease. Participants will receive vobramitamab duocarmazine at a dose of 2.7 mg/kg every 4 weeks. Up to 200 participants may be enrolled in Part 2.

In both parts, vobramitamab duocarmazine will be administered intravenously (IV) in clinic on Day 1 of each 4-week cycle. Vobramitamab duocarmazine will be administered until criteria for treatment discontinuation are met. Participants will undergo regular testing for signs of disease progression using computed tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), bone scans, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood tests. Routine examinations and blood tests will be performed and evaluated by the study doctor.

Part 1: Radiographic progression free survival (rPFS) as determined by the investigator, The landmark analysis for 6 month rPFS rate will occur when all participants on Part 1 have been on study for at least 6 months. rPFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documented progressive disease (PD) per Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Every 8 weeks for the first 24 weeks, then every 12 weeks, up to 2 years|Part 2: Objective response rate (ORR) per investigator assessment of Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) 1.1 criteria, The ORR is defined as the percentage of participants in the response evaluable population who achieve a best overall response of conplete response (CR) or partial response (PR), per RECIST version 1.1 criterial CR is defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease from baseline in the sum of diameters of target lesions., Every 8 weeks for the first 24 weeks, then every 12 weeks, up to 2 years
Part 1: ORR per PCWG3 criteria as determined by the investigator, The percentage of participants experiencing a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) to treatment. CR + PR = ORR, Every 8 weeks for the first 24 weeks, then every 12 weeks, up to 2 years|Part 1: Median duration of response (DoR) per PCWG3 criteria as determined by the investigator, The DoR will be calculated as the time from the date of initial tumor response (CR or PR) to the date of first documented PD or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Every 8 weeks for the first 24 weeks, then every 12 weeks, up to 2 years|Part 1: Tumor size change over time, Every 8 weeks for the first 24 weeks, then every 12 weeks, up to 2 years|Part 1: Prostate-specific Cancer Antigen (PSA) response rate per PCWG3 criteria, PSA response is defined as a ≥ 50% decline in PSA from baseline with PSA confirmation ≥ 3 weeks after the first documented reduction in PSA of ≥ 50%., Every 4 weeks throughout study participation, up to 2 years|Part 1: Time to PSA progression per PCWG3 criteria, In participants with a decrease in PSA from baseline, PSA progression is defined as a ≥ 25% increase and an absolute increase of ≥ 2 ng/mL above the nadir value, which is confirmed by a consecutive second value obtained ≥ 3 weeks later.

In participants with no decrease in PSA from baseline, PSA progression is defined as a ≥ 25% increase and an absolute increase of ≥ 2 ng/mL above the baseline value after 12 weeks.

Time to PSA progression is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the first PSA progression., Every 4 weeks throughout study participation, up to 2 years|Part 1: Duration of PSA response per PCWG3 criteria, Duration of PSA response is defined as the time from the date of first documented PSA response to the earliest date of PSA progression., Every 4 weeks throughout study participation, up to 2 years|Part 1: PSA percent change over time, Every 4 weeks throughout study participation, up to 2 years|Part 1: Time to first symptomatic skeletal event (SSE), An SSE is defined as any of the following events: new symptomatic pathological fracture, requirement for radiation therapy to relieve bone pain, spinal cord compression, or tumor-related orthopedic surgical intervention.
