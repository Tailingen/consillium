Discovering New Genetic Markers in Adults and Children Who May Be At Risk for Hereditary Forms of Cancer
This study is being done to attempt to identify genetic mutations or other gene-based variations in adults and children who have cancer, or are likely to develop an inherited form of cancer, and potentially reduce their risk for cancer or treat the cancer earlier.
