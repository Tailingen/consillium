Feasibility and Safety of IMP321 (Eftilagimod Alpha) for Advanced Stage Solid Tumors
This phase I trial aims to investigate a potential enhancement of IMP321 immune-activating effects by new routes of administration: direct injection of IMP321 into the tumor tissue; intra-peritoneal therapy; combination of chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy/targeted therapy with active immunotherapy

Up to now, IMP321 is solely administered by sub-cutaneous injection (e.g. on the anterior face of the thigh). In this study, we investigate whether a direct injection of IMP321 into the tumor tissue will be a useful option to improve anti-tumor immune response by placing the immune-therapeutic agent in direct vicinity of immune infiltrates in the tumor bed. This bypasses processes necessary for drug delivery to cells of solid tumors following systemic administration, like transport within vessels, transport across vasculature walls into surrounding tissues, and - in cases of peritoneal metastases - transport through the interstitial space within a tumor. For the latter case, we will also explore if an intra-peritoneal therapy represents a feasible alternative by means of delivering high drug concentrations directly to tumors located in the peritoneal cavity.

Furthermore, we will explore the possibility to extend the positive results obtained by subcutaneous injections of IMP321 in metastatic renal cell and breast carcinomas to further solid tumor entities. In this part of the study, patients will be treated with the standard-of-care (SOC) chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy/targeted therapy for their tumor entity along with subcutaneous injections of IMP321.
