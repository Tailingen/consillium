Progression-free survival, Failure: progression or death due to any cause, From the date of registration to the date of first PFS failure or last follow-up; assessed up to 6 years; Median PFS of all registered patients will be over 30 months
Overall survival, Failure: death due to any cause, From the date of registration to the date of death or last follow-up; assessed up to 10 years
Local treatment included surgical resection, stereotactic body radiotherapy, palliative radiotherapy, and radiofrequency ablation. Stereotactic body radiotherapy is preferred as a radiation modality.
