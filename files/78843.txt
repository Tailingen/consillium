Study to Evaluate Real-world Pharmacoeconomics of Panitumumab in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Patients
This is a phase IV multicenter trial to evaluate real-world health outcomes and economic impact of panitumumab versus standard-of-care (SOC) in the treatment of patients with chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).

The study will enable real-life health economics and outcome research (HEOR) to assess the impact of panitumumab in the Quebec population.

The primary objective is to evaluate real-world health outcomes and economic impact of panitumumab in the treatment of patients with chemotherapy-refractory mCRC in comparison with SOC. The secondary objectives are to confirm survival data, to assess the quality of life of patients and to assess the health care resource utilization of patients.

Patients with a mutated KRAS gene will be treated with standard-of-care (SOC) and patients with a non-mutated (wild type) KRAS gene will be treated with panitumumab.

During the course of the study, data will be collected on quality of life and work productivity. Patients will be asked to fill a set of questionnaires at their recruitment in the study and at every 3 months after treatment initiation.
Colorectal Cancer Metastatic
The pharmacoeconomic impact of panitumumab for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer in a real-life setting, Pharmacoeconomic impact (cost-effectiveness and cost-utility) will be evaluated by questionnaires completed by the patient and caregiver. These include quality of life, health resource utilization, work productivity and activity impairment, and health questionnaires., From the date of registration until date of death from any cause, assessed up to 38 months
