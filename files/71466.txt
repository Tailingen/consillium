Paclitaxel and Capecitabine in Treating Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of paclitaxel and capecitabine in treating women who have metastatic breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: capecitabine|DRUG: paclitaxel
OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety, response rate, and efficacy of combination therapy with paclitaxel and capecitabine as first or second line therapy in women with metastatic breast cancer.
