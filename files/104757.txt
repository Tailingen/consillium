The Women In Steady Exercise Research (WISER) Survivor Trial
WISER Survivor is a one year weight loss and exercise study for sedentary breast cancer survivors who are overweight or obese with breast cancer related lymphedema. There will be four groups in this trial: exercise only, weight loss only, exercise and weight-loss combined, and a control group. The primary purpose of this study is to test the effects of these interventions on clinical lymphedema outcomes. Secondary outcomes include weight loss, breast cancer related biomarkers, and quality of life. To the extent that funding will be available, participants will be followed long term to examine effects on recurrence and mortality.
Lymphedema
BEHAVIORAL: Exercise Intervention|BEHAVIORAL: Weight Loss Intervention
Percent interlimb difference, change over 12 months., Arm volumes for affected and unaffected limbs will be measured by perometry and the % difference will be determined at baseline and 12 months. the absolute percentage point difference of differences (% interlimb difference at 12 months minus % interlimb difference at baseline) will be the primary outcome, Baseline and 12 months
