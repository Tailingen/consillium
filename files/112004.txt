EUS-guided Transenteric Drainage With a Novel Lumen-apposing Metal Stent
To evaluate clinical efficacy and safety of a novel lumen-apposing FCSEMS for EUS-guided transenteric drainage of PFC or of biliary tree including GB
Pancreatic Pseudocyst|Pancreatic Necrosis|Biliary Obstruction|Acute Cholecystitis
DEVICE: EUS-guided drainage
Clinical success for pancreatic fluid collections, â‘  Clinical success of pancreatic fluid collections

* Peudocyst: resolution more than 50% in the initial size of cyst.
* Walled-off necrosis: resolution of PFC without the need for additional interventions after endoscopic interventions., 8 hrs|Clinical success for acute cholecystitis, - Afebrile for 8 hours, tolerating diet, absence of abdominal sign, or 20% decrease in white cell count., 8hrs|Clinical success for obstructive jaundice, - A decrease in total bilirubin to \< 50 % of the pre-stenting value within 2 weeks., 2 weeks
Techincal success, - Satisfactory access, placement of stent and drainage., 1 day|Adverse events, * Bleeding: any hemorrhagic event during or after the procedure that required endotherapy, radiological interventions, blood product transfusion, or inpatient observation.

  * Perforation: perforation of the GI tract or cystic wall on imaging studies with peritonitis signs.

    * Pneumoperitoneum or pneumoretroperitoneum: intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal air on imaging study.

      * Stent migration: dislocation of the stent into the lumen or the GI tract on imaging study, 30 day
Patients with the following conditions would be recruited for drainage under EUS guidance with the new lumen apposing FCSEMS

* Symptomatic or infected pancreatic pseudocyst or walled-off necrosis (WON) (SPAXUS 16 or 10 mm)
* Acute cholecystitis by inoperable malignant diseases (SPAXUS 10 mm)
* Acute cholecystitis by benign conditions with high-risk for operation (SPAXUS 10 mm)
* Long-term cholecystostomy at high-risk for operation (SPAXUS 10 mm)
* Symptomatic malignant obstruction of the distal CBD with unsuccessful transpapillary approach (the diameter of the CBD \> 10 mm) (SPAXUS 8 or 10 mm)

Outcome paramaters include technical and clinical success, adverse events.
