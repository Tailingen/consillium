Combination of Durvalumab and Tremelimumab as Maintenance Treatment in Patients With Non Squamous and Squamous (NSCLC)
This is a multicenter, 2-arm open-label, randomized comparative phase II study in each of two separate cohorts (non-squamous NSCLC and squamous NSCLC) according to histology.
Squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer|Non-Squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Durvalumab|DRUG: Tremelimumab
Progression free survival (PFS), The time interval between the date of randomization and the date of disease progression or death, whichever comes first., 4.3 years from FPI
Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time interval between the date of randomization and the date of death from any cause., 5 years from FPI|Objective response rate according to RECIST 1.1;, Patients with response categories progression, early death and unknown will be considered as failing to respond to treatment. The response rates in each arm and their 95% confidence intervals will be provided., 5 years from FPI|Progression-free survival -2, PFS-2 calculated as the time between randomization and the 2nd PD or death, not of the maintenance treatment/observation but the PD after the subsequent treatment thus taking into account the influence of the treatment under investigation on the following treatment line., 5 years from FPI|Time to failure of 2nd treatment, Defined as the time between randomization and the permanent treatment interruption of the subsequent/second treatment (treatment received after progression of the first treatment) due to progressive disease, PS worsening, unacceptable toxicity that does not allow continuing the treatment according to the investigator., 5 years from FPI|Safety, All adverse events will be recorded according to CTCAE version 4., 5 years from FPI|Quality of life, The hypothesis to test is whether the possible benefit with respect to PFS/OS of the intense maintenance treatment will also translate in a better QoL or will the higher risk of Adverse events cause a reduction in QoL. (methodology: quality of life questionnaires), 5 years from FPI
Patients will receive four cycles of standard platinum-based doublet chemotherapy. Upon confirmation of response or tumor stabilization, patients will be registered and allocated into two cohorts based on the tumor histology and each cohort will be randomized into two arms. The experimental arm will receive combination of durvalumab + tremelimumab, the other arm is according to standard of care.

The objective of this trial is to evaluate whether a maintenance approach with the combination immunotherapy with durvalumab + tremelimumab improves progression-free survival (PFS) compared to standard of care in patients with advanced NSCLC. Each cohort is powered separately based on PFS.
