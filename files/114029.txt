Transversus Abdominis Plane Block Compared to Local Anesthetic Wound Infiltration in Gynecologic Oncology Surgery
This study is being done to see if preoperative transversus abdominis plane (TAP) analgesia will provide similar postoperative pain control, hospital length of stay, and postoperative outcomes compared to surgeon-initiated wound infiltration with local anesthetic in participants undergoing laparotomy for gynecologic indications.

Total opioid use measured in oral morphine equivalents for the first 24 hours post-surgery, Total opioid use measured in oral morphine equivalents for the first 24 hours post-surgery (including intraoperative and Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) opioid utilization)., 24 hours post-surgery
Mean postoperative pain score for the first 24 hours post-surgery, Mean postoperative pain score for the first 24 hours post-surgery, measured by the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), which rates pain on a 0-10 scale (collected routinely on the post-operative floor). Higher numbers indicate worse pain., 24 hours post-surgery|Length of hospital stay, measured in whole hours from admission to PACU to time of discharge order placement, estimated to be up to 3 days|Post-operative anti-emetic use, A study team member will review the patient's medical chart to record the number of times an anti-emetic was given to the subject., estimated to be up to 3 days|Number of recorded episodes of emesis, A study team member will review the patient's medical chart to record number of times the hospital staff observed a participant vomit., estimated to be up to 3 days|Return of bowel function measured in whole hours from completion of surgery to passage of flatus, estimated to be up to 3 days|Participant Satisfaction at Postoperative Visit measured by two pain questions from the QoR-15 Patient Reported Outcomes Survey Score, Scores are from 0-10 where 0 is pain all of the time and 10 is pain none of the time., post-operative visit (up to 60 days)|Readmission rate measured by readmission in the 30 days following surgery, up to 30 days|Cost of care measured by aggregate cost of hospitalization following discharge from surgical hospital stay, estimated to be up to 3 days|Summary of Post-operative Complications, Postoperative complications, as defined by urinary tract infections, thromboembolic events, pneumonia, blood transfusion, cardiac events, falls, and electrolyte disturbances will be summarized by type and number of complications., up to 30 days post-operatively|Time to First Ambulation measured in hours, A study team member will review the participant's medical chart to record the interval (in hours) from completion of surgery to first ambulation after surgery., estimated to be within 72 hours post-surgery
Primary Objective

* To evaluate the effects of preoperative TAP analgesia compared to surgeon-initiated wound infiltration with local anesthetic on pain control in subjects undergoing laparotomy.

Secondary Objectives

* To evaluate the effects of preoperative TAP analgesia compared to surgeon-initiated wound infiltration with local anesthetic on subject-rated perception of pain in subjects undergoing laparotomy.
* To evaluate the effects of preoperative TAP analgesia compared to surgeon-initiated wound infiltration with local anesthetic on length of hospital stay in subjects undergoing laparotomy.
* To evaluate the effects of preoperative TAP analgesia compared to surgeon-initiated wound infiltration with local anesthetic on postoperative anti-emetic use and number of recorded episodes of emesis in subjects undergoing laparotomy.
* To evaluate the effects of preoperative TAP analgesia compared to surgeon-initiated wound infiltration with local anesthetic on return of bowel function in subjects undergoing laparotomy.
* To evaluate the effects of preoperative TAP analgesia compared to surgeon-initiated wound infiltration with local anesthetic on subject satisfaction in subjects undergoing laparotomy.
* To evaluate the effects of preoperative TAP analgesia compared to surgeon-initiated wound infiltration with local anesthetic on postoperative complications in subjects undergoing laparotomy.
* To evaluate the effects of preoperative TAP analgesia compared to surgeon-initiated wound infiltration with local anesthetic on readmission rates in subjects undergoing laparotomy.
* To evaluate the cost of care associated with TAP analgesia compared to surgeon-initiated wound infiltration with local anesthetic on readmission rates in subjects undergoing laparotomy.
