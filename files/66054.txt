Study of Ibrutinib + CD20 Antibody and Venetoclax in Patients With Untreated Mantle Cell Lymphoma
The OASIS II trial is a multicentre, open label, randomized phase II trial. We will compare the efficacy of Ibrutinib/anti-CD20 Ab versus Ibrutinib/anti-CD20 Ab/Venetoclax given as fixed duration combinations in newly diagnosed Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) patients (≥ 18 years and \< 80 years of age).

Treatment duration of Ibrutinib and Venetoclax will be a maximum of two years. Patients will be treated with CD20 Ab for 3.5 years.

The primary aim is to assess MRD status at 6 months in both arms.
