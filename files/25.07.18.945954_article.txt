The microbiome is a predictor of clinical outcome in patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). Microbiota-derived metabolites can modulate these outcomes. How bacteria, fungi and viruses contribute to the production of intestinal metabolites is still unclear. We combined amplicon sequencing, viral metagenomics and targeted metabolomics from stool samples of patients receiving allo-SCT (n = 78) and uncovered a microbiome signature of Lachnospiraceae and Oscillospiraceae and their associated bacteriophages, correlating with the production of immunomodulatory metabolites (IMMs). Moreover, we established the IMM risk index (IMM-RI), which was associated with improved survival and reduced relapse. A high abundance of short-chain fatty acid-biosynthesis pathways, specifically butyric acid via butyryl-coenzyme A (CoA):acetate CoA-transferase (BCoAT, which catalyzes EC 2.8.3.8) was detected in IMM-RI low-risk patients, and virome genome assembly identified two bacteriophages encoding BCoAT as an auxiliary metabolic gene. In conclusion, our study identifies a microbiome signature associated with protective IMMs and provides a rationale for considering metabolite-producing consortia and metabolite formulations as microbiome-based therapies.

a) Quantification of the bacterial and fungal load by 16S and 28S rDNA copy numbers per gram of stool at time-points relative to all-SCT (Day 0). Solid lines represent the smoothed conditional means for the entire cohort (black), Munich (MUC, orange) or Regensburg (REG, red) calculated by locally weighted regression using the locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) method. The gray shading indicates the 95% confidence interval for entire cohort. Each individual patient stool sample is plotted as a gray dot superimposed on the graph. The number of samples is indicated. b) Beta diversity analysis illustrating changes in bacteriome, fungome and virome by time-points relative to allo-SCT (Day 0). For bacteriome and fungome, beta diversity was calculated by weighted UniFrac. For virome, beta diversity was calculated by Bray-Curtis dissimilarity. Distances were projected in Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA). Bacteriome: Comparisons between Day +7 (p = 0.001), Day + 14 (p = 0.001), Day +21 (p = 0.001), Day +28 (p = 0.001) vs baseline (Day −7) are significant (pairwise Adonis test adjusted for multiple comparisons). Virome: Comparisons between Day +7 (p = 0.013) and Day +28 (p = 0.001) vs baseline are significant (PERMANOVA test). The number of samples is indicated. c) Beta diversity analysis illustrating changes in bacteriome, fungome and virome according to study center (MUC or REG) and whether patients received antifungal therapy (’No Antifungals’ or ‘Antifungals’). For bacteriome and virome, beta diversity was calculated by weighted UniFrac. For virome, beta diversity was calculated by Bray-Curtis dissimilarity. Distances were projected in Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA). The number of samples is indicated.
Source data
a) Heatmap of normalized Panel 1 metabolite levels in stool samples of allo-SCT patients averaged by time-points relative to allo-SCT. Normalized concentrations are indicated in the adjacent color legend. Clustering based on metabolite expression patterns using the Ward algorithm. Distance measure is Euclidian. The number of samples is indicated. b) Heatmap of normalized Panel 2 metabolite levels in stool samples of allo-SCT patients averaged by time-points relative to allo-SCT. Normalized concentrations are indicated in the adjacent color legend. Clustering based on metabolite expression patterns using the Ward algorithm. Distance measure is Euclidian. The number of samples is indicated. c) Principal component analysis (PCA) of Panel 1 metabolite profiles by time-points relative to allo-SCT. Comparisons at Day 0 (p = 0.004), Day +7 (p = 0.001), Day +14 (p = 0.001), Day +21 (p = 0.001) and Day +28 (p = 0.001) vs Day -7 are significant (pairwise Adonis test of Euclidean distances adjusted for multiple comparisons). d) PCA of Panel 2 metabolite profiles by time-points relative to allo-SCT. Comparisons at Day +7 (p = 0.001), Day +14 (p = 0.001), Day +21 (p = 0.001) and Day +28 (p = 0.001) vs Day −7 are significant (pairwise Adonis test of Euclidean distances adjusted for multiple comparisons).
a) Correlation between MOFA-identified Factors and normalized intestinal metabolite concentrations. Associations between Factor values and metabolites were analyzed via Pearson’s correlation. The correlation coefficient is indicated in the adjacent color legend. The p-values associated with the correlations were corrected for multiple testing with the FDR approach. b) Top 15 Features in bacteriome, virome and metabolites in Factor 4 in descending order according to Feature weight. Larger weights indicate a higher correlation with that Factor, while the positive or negative sign indicates the directionality of that variation, that is, ‘+’ indicates a positive association, ‘−’ a negative association. c) Bar plot of time scale parameters assigned to Factors 1 through 10 identified by MEFISTO. MEFISTO assigns a time scale value between 0 and 1 to each Factor, which reflects the degree to which that Factor is dependent on time. A value of 0 implies no time-dependency, a value of 1 strong time-dependency. Of note, results pertaining to the identified Factors, their weight/covariance structure, variance explained across omics entities and Factor values obtained by MEFISTO modelling were almost identical and thus comparable to the output of our original MOFA model. d) Heatmap of normalized abundance of viral contigs assigned to eukaryotic and prokaryotic viruses at time-points relative to allo-SCT. The number of samples is indicated.
a) Heatmaps of pairwise Pearson’s correlations of top Features across different omics modalities. The Feature values of the top 15 high-weight Features of a given omics modality were correlated with that of another omics modality. (Left) bacterial taxa at genus level and metabolites, (right) bacterial taxa at genus level and bacteriophages at species level. The correlation coefficient is indicated in the adjacent color legend. The p-values associated with Pearson correlation have been corrected for multiple testing by applying the FDR approach to each set of correlations of two omics modalities of a given Factor. b) As in a) for Factor 3. c) As in a) for Factor 4.
Source data
a) Correlation scatter plots of high-weight Features within Factor 4, comparing normalized abundance of bacterial taxa at genus level (x-axis) with that of bacteriophages at species level (y-axis) together with the metabolite propionic acid. Dots represent samples from individual patients at different time points (91 samples from 45 patients), all of which had both 16S and viral metagenomic sequencing data. Dots are colored by intestinal levels of propionic acid, or in grey if no propionic acid data was available. Normalized concentrations of metabolites are indicated in the adjacent heatmap.

a) 2-year OS after Day 21 stratified according to higher and lower fungal (left) and viral (right) alpha diversity. The mean alpha diversity of patient samples at Days +7–21 was calculated and patients were stratified into higher (blue curve) and lower (red curve) diversity groups, defined as above or below the center-specific median Inverse Simpson’s diversity index. For fungome, there were 12 deaths among 32 patients in the lower-diversity group (estimated mean survival time 521 (95% CI 428-614) days) and 10 deaths among 30 patients in the higher-diversity group (estimated mean survival time 597 (95% CI 522-672) days). For virome, there were 4 deaths among 16 patients in the lower-diversity group (estimated mean survival time 587 (95% CI 479-696) days) and 4 deaths among 15 patients in the higher-diversity group (estimated mean survival time 576 (95% CI 450-701) days).
