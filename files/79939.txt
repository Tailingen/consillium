Therefore the lowest possible score is 7 for a severely negative perception of the education and the highest score is 28 for a very positive impression of the education program. Only the total scores will be compared for statistical analysis. Scores from patients in the current standard and new personalized education intervention groups will be compared., Subjects will be expected to mail the feedback forms within 2 weeks of discharge. Investigators will mail a single reminder prepaid return mail with a copy of the questionnaire to patients who do not respond within this time allowing 1 month total time.
