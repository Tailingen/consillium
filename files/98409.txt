Off-the-shelf CD123 CAR-NK for R/R AML
This is a single-centre, single-arm, open-label, first-in-human (FIH) study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of universal Off-the-shelf CAR-NK cells targeted CD123 (JD123 injection) in the treatment of refractory or relapsed CD123-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

This is a dose-escalation study of CD123-targeted chimeric antigen receptor modified natural killer cells (CAR-NK) derived from a healthy donor. The relapsed/refractory AML patients will receive FC (F, Fludarabine, C, Cyclophosphamide) chemotherapy followed by infusion of JD123 injections. No graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prevention will be conducted before or after infusion. Dose-limiting toxicity, incidence of adverse events, disease response and PK/PD will be detected post-infusion.
