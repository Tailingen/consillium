Personalized Therapy for Esophagogastric Cancer Using Thymidylate Synthase Genetic Markers
In this study the investigators aim to: 1) confirm the objective response rate (ORR) observed in the investigators initial study for patients with the TSER\*2/\*2 genotype 2) determine whether PEMOX regimen is more worthy of future development for this patient genotype selected population than FOLFOX based on the data indicating that pemetrexed may be a better TS targeted agent than 5-FU.

Patients who are homozygous for the TSER\*2 allele (TSER\*2/\*2) will be able to continue in the study and will be randomized. Patients with other TSER genotypes will not be included and will be considered screen fails.

The first 8 patients with the TSER\*2/\*2 genotype will be randomized 1:1 to receive treatment with either PEMOX or FOLFOX (4 in each group).

Analysis of the objective response rate (ORR) in each treatment arm will occur after the first 8 patients are enrolled. Using the proposed Bayesian design, subsequent patients will be preferentially assigned to the "better performing" treatment arm based on continuous real-time reassessments of ORR results.
Esophagogastric Cancer
DRUG: Pemetrexed|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Leucovorin|DRUG: Fluorouracil|GENETIC: Germline genotyping analyses for TSER
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR=complete response + partial response by RECIST criteria

Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm.

Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., Baseline, end of every 4th cycle, and end of treatment (estimated average of 6 months)
Overall survival (OS), OS = The length of time from the start of treatment to time of death., Every 3 months for up to 4 years from the date of study registration or until death, whichever occurs first|Quality of life, Quality of life will be assessed by the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the EORTC QLQ-STO22, Baseline and Day 1 of each cycle through Cycle 5 Day 1 (approximately Day 70)
