Health Related Quality of Life After Video Assisted Thoracoscopic Lobectomy for Lung Cancer
To test the effect of post operative complications on the health related quality of life (HRQOL) after Video Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS) for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).

The HRQOL of patients with early stage NSCLC will be assessed at baseline (before surgery) using 3 different reliable and valid HRQOL questionnaire (SF-36, EQ-5D and QLQ30/13), then at regular intervals in the early post-operative period (2,4,8 and 12 weeks) the HRQOL will be assessed using the same questionnaires to determine the difference between patients with low/no post operative complications to those with high grade post-operative complications.

Post operative complications will be assess while the patients in the hospital on a daily basis using the Clavien classification system for surgical complications.
Operable Early Stage NSCLC by the VATS Approach
Health related Quality of life, Health Related Quality of Life will be assessed using the SF-36, EQ-5D and QLQ30/13 questionnaires., Change in health related quality of life at 2 weeks. Change of Health Related Quality of Life at 4 weeks. Change in Health Related Quality of Life at 8 weeks. Change in Health Related Quality of Life at 12 weeks.
