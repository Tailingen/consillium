Endostar Combination With Chemotherapy for the Metastatic Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
The investigators designed this study to evaluate the efficiency and the acute toxicities of recombinant human endostatin (endostar) combined with chemotherapy in the metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
DRUG: endostatin
progress free survival(PFS), PFS means assignament to the date of any local or distant progress of the disease useing Kaplan-Meier caculate the progress free survival rates, 1 year and 2years
overall survival(OS), the overall survival denote to assignment to date of death from any cause. Using Kaplan-Meier to caculate the 1-year ,2-year,3-year overall survival rate, baseline to date of death from any cause|Adverse events, observe and record the toxicity profile(incluing but not limit to mocositis,liver and kidney function,et al.)according NCI-CTCAE(3rd edtion) during the chemotherapy,Targeted therapy and follow-up, participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay,an expected average of 100 days and every 3 months thereafter for 1 year
To evaluate the progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), Acute adverse reaction of recombinant human endostatin (endostar) combined with chemotherapy to the metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).
