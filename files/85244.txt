Behavioral Activation and Medication Optimization For Improving Perioperative Mental Health In Older Adults Undergoing Oncologic Surgery
Using a Hybrid Type 1 Effectiveness-Implementation randomized control trial (RCT) design, the investigators will test the effectiveness of a bundled behavioral activation and medication optimization in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety in older adults undergoing oncologic surgery (compared with usual care), while examining implementation outcomes.
