This is a single-centre, dose-escalating, randomized, blinded and active controlled trial in healthy Chinese women ages 18-45. The positive control is Recombinant nonavalent Human Papillomavirus (Types 6,11,16,18,31,33,45,52,58) Vaccine.

The trial will be conducted in two stages:

Stage 1: A single-center, open-label trial will be carried out in 40 healthy women ages 27-45 in the enrolment order of mid-dosage group followed by high-dosage group. Each group of 20 subjects will be administered the mid-, and high-dosage form, respectively, to preliminarily evaluate the safety profile of the investigational vaccine.

First, the 20 subjects in the mid-dosage group will be sequentially enrolled as two batches of 5 and 15 subjects, respectively, at an enrolment interval of no less than 3 days. One week after vaccinating all the 20 subjects in the mid-dosage group, upon confirmation of the safety profile of the investigational vaccine as acceptable, 20 subjects for the higher dosage-group will be enrolled subsequently in the same manner as those in the mid-dosage group.

Subjects in each dosage group will receive a 3-dose regimen at months 0, 2 and 6. Safety of the investigational vaccine will be assessed for 30 days following each injection, and SAE will be reported for the duration of the study. In total there will be 12 scheduled visits for subjects in each dosage group throughout the study.

One week after vaccinating all the 40 subjects in stage 1, if the safety profile of the investigational vaccine is confirmed to be acceptable, the study may proceed to stage 2.

Stage 2:

A phase I, single-center, dose-escalating, randomized and blinded (as to intra-dosage group) trial, with Gardasil9 as the positive control will be carried out in 120 healthy women ages 18-26 in the enrolment order of low-, mid-, and high-dosage groups. Each group of 40 subjects will be enrolled and randomized at a 3: 1 ratio to receive the investigational vaccine or positive control, respectively (that is, 10 of the subjects in each dosage group will receive the positive control).

Firstly, the 40 subjects in the low-dosage group will be sequentially enrolled as four batches of 5, 10, 10 and 15 subjects, respectively, at an enrolment interval of no less than 3 days to get the first dose of the low-dosage investigational vaccine or positive control. Then, one week after vaccinating all the 40 subjects in the low-dosage group, upon confirmation of the safety profile of the investigational vaccine as acceptable, 40 subjects will be enrolled subsequently into the mid-dosage group in the same manner as those in the low-dosage group. Again, one week after vaccinating the 40 subjects in the mid-dosage group, if the safety profile of the investigational vaccine continues to be acceptable, another group of 40 subjects receiving the high-dosage investigational vaccine or positive control will be enrolled subsequently in the same manner as those in the low-dosage group.

In both stage 1 and stage 2 of the phase I study, 5 ml of non-anticoagulative blood will be collected from trial subjects prior to dose 1 and at Month 3 and Month 7 post dose 1 to determine the levels of neutralizing antibodies and IgG antibodies to the vaccine HPV types.
