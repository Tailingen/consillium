HSV-tk and XRT and Chemotherapy for Newly Diagnosed GBM
Study to assess the safety and efficacy of HSV-tk (gene therapy), valacyclovir, radiotherapy and chemotherapy in newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) or anaplastic astrocytoma (AA).
Glioblastoma|Anaplastic Astrocytoma
DRUG: ADV/HSV-tk (gene therapy)
Overall Survival in months up to 5 years from Study drug administration (Day 0), The overall survival rate of patients with Anaplastic Astrocytoma and Glioblastoma in months will be assessed up to 5 years from study drug administration., Up to 60 months measured in months
Progression free survival assessments will be done every 6-8 weeks for 1st year thereafter every 12-14 weeks until disease progression or death, Patients will have MRI or CT every 6-8 weeks for the first year post surgery. Thereafter patient will have MRI or CT every 12-14 weeks until completion of the protocol study specific treatment. Progression free survival will be assessed by RANO response criteria., Up to 60 months measured in months
This is a prospective, phase I-II study to assess the efficacy and toxicity of HSV-tk + valacyclovir gene therapy in combination with radiotherapy and standard of care chemotherapy for anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) or glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). This study is comprised of newly diagnosed patients with AA or GBM.

Clinical response will be evaluated by neurological evaluation, neuropsychological testing, and imaging studies as well as by histological examination. Blood samples will be taken for systemic immunological response, blood counts, and liver functions tests. Genetic testing of tumor tissue will be performed, including genetic analysis and cell cultures. Toxicity will be graded by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03 and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) neuro-toxicity scores (see Appendices). Patients will also be followed to assess median time to progression and median survival.
