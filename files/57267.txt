First-line Combination of Capecitabine and Oxaliplatin Plus Bevacizumab in Elderly Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
* Oxaliplatin-based doublets plus bevacizumab are standard first-line therapy options for patients (pts) with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Slight adjustments in chemo-dosage are commonly applied in routinely practice to elderly pts, but those modified schedules have never been standardized
* The addition of oxaliplatin versus no oxaliplatin to treatment with 5-fluorouracil in older and frail untreated pts with mCRC resulted in a non-statistically significant trend toward improvement in Progression Free Survival (PFS) and a lack of benefit in Overall Survival (OS)
* In elderly pts deemed unfit for an upfront combined chemotherapy a fluoropyrimide-based monotherapy plus bevacizumab is considered a reasonable first-line treatment
* Clinical definition of elderly (over 70 years old) pts with CRC that may deserve a more or less intensive combination therapy is still debated. The cut-off of 75 years old combined with ECOG PS assessment is a reasonable approach for clearly defining candidates to different approaches
* Several geriatric screening tools have been used to identify pts with a geriatric profile potentially predicting for overall survival and risk of toxicity. The G8 screening tool has been already validated in pts with cancer showing the strongest prognostic value for OS; the CRASH score is able to stratify pts according an estimated risk of treatment-related toxicities

On the basis of these considerations, we designed the present observational study of first-line therapy with bevacizumab in combination with capecitabine and oxaliplatin in previously untreated elderly pts affected by unresectable mCRC in order to evaluate its efficacy in real world practice (as measured by progression free survival)
Elderly Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Patients
DRUG: Capecitabine|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Bevacizumab
Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from study enrollment to the first documentation of objective disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 28 months
