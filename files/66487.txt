Neoadjuvant Study of Pyrotinib in Patients With HER2 Positive Breast Cancer
This is a randomized, double-blind multicenter Phase III study for evaluating the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant pyrotinib and trastuzumab plus docetaxel and Carboplatin versus placebo and trastuzumab plus docetaxel and Carboplatin given as neoadjuvant treatment in HER2 positive early stage or locally advanced breast cancer.

pCR, Percentage of Participants With Pathological Complete Response (pCR) at the Time of Surgery., through study completion, an average of 1 year
EFS, Event-free survival, Following surgery until Year 3|DFS, Disease-free Survival, Following surgery until Year 3|DDFS, Distance Disease-free Survival, Following surgery until Year 3|ORR, Objective Response Rate, Baseline up to cycle 4 (assessed at Baseline, at the time of pre-surgery)up to approximately 12 months
The investigators hypothesized that the experimental group (Pyrotinib+Trastuzumab+Docetaxel+ Carboplatin) could have a higher Pathological Complete Response (pCR) rate than the control group (Placebo +Trastuzumab+Docetaxel+ Carboplatin) in neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

It is proposed that 100 participants will be enrolled in this study. The target population is women with early breast cancer (stage of T1-4N0-3M0) who are eligible for primary systemic therapy.

The primary objective of the trial is to determine the pCR rate. The secondary objective of the trial is to determine the Event-free survival(EFS), Disease-free Survival (DFS), Distance Disease-free Survival (DDFS), Objective Response Rate (ORR) rate.
