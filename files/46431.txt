Efficacy and Safety of Generic Imatinib (Carcemia®) Compared to Glivec® in Real-Life Management of Chronic Phase of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
The purpose of this study is to evaluate Efficacy and Safety of Generic Imatinib (Carcemia®) Compared to Glivec® in Real-Life Management of Chronic Phase of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Carcemia|DRUG: Glivec
Proportion of patients who achieve and maintain major molecular response (MMR) at 12 months, Proportion of patients who achieve and maintain major molecular response (MMR) at 12 months using RQ-PCR test (Appendix II) using Chi-square test. The MMR is defined as ration of BCR-ABL to ABL (or other housekeeping gene) ≤ 0.1% on the international scale (MMR is equal to a 3-log reduction in the ratio of BCR-ABL1: ABL from a standardized median baseline value)., 12 months
the safety & tolerability of imatinib after 12 months, In both cohorts, the safety \& tolerability of imatinib after 12 months of treatment will be assessed by:

* The number, type, severity and frequency of the adverse reactions particularly those described in the SmPC of the reference product.
* Incidence of adverse events (AEs) \& serious adverse events (SAEs).
* AEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation.
* Clinically relevant changes in laboratory tests (according to laboratory reference ranges)., 12 months|Progression free survival (PFS) at 12 months, 12 months|Event free survival (EFS) at 12 months, 12 months|Survival without blastic phase (BP) at 12 months, 12 months|Overall survival (OS) at 12 months, 12 months|Complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) at 12 months, 12 months|Deep Molecular response (DMR) at 12 months, 12 months|Treatment compliance, Treatment compliance while on imatinib will be evaluated by identifying the frequency of not taking the medications as prescribed and the reason behind that based on the prescription pattern. The decision on non-compliance is based on the treating physician's judgment.", 12 months
This is an observational, prospective, cohort study design, where no visits or intervention(s) additional to the daily practice will be performed. In the study site, two cohorts will be identified among eligible patients, followed up, and assessed for a total of 12 months.
