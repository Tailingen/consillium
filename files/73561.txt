Prevention of Recurrence and Metastasis in Genetically High-Risk Melanomas
The purpose of this study is to determine whether a medication, fluvastatin, can change melanoma to a state that is less likely to metastasize or recur.

Fluvastatin is experimental in this setting because it is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment or prevention of melanoma. However, fluvastatin has been approved by the FDA for treating high cholesterol.
Malignant Melanoma
DRUG: Fluvastatin|OTHER: RNA-sequencing|OTHER: Gene expression profiling
Genetic profile shift in melanoma transcriptome, The study team will report which of the 28 genes had significant expression changes. A 2-fold change in the appropriate direction with a p-value of at least 0.05 will be considered significant for potential therapeutic value. P-values will be corrected for the false discovery rate using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. Fluvastatin successful in shifting the genetic profile in a therapeutic manner if at least half of the 28 genes have significant expression changes, Two weeks
Number of patients who convert from Class 2 to Class 1, Number of patients who convert from Class 2 to Class 1 profile on retesting, Two weeks
This is an open-label, single arm, study assessing the activity of fluvastatin in shifting the transcriptome in melanoma. Subjects with melanoma will be asked to participate and all subjects will receive the study drug, fluvastatin, for 2 weeks.

The primary objective of this study to determine whether administration of fluvastatin changes the melanoma transcriptome

The secondary objective of this study is to determine whether administration of fluvastatin changes the gene expression profile of Class 2 melanoma to Class 1 melanoma.
