A Phase III Study of ESG401 for Unresectable Recurrent or Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer
The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ESG401 as first-line treatment in patients with unresectable recurrent or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.
Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC)
DRUG: ESG401|DRUG: Investigator's Choice Chemotherapy
Progression Free Survival (PFS) assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), Defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression per RECIST 1.1 based on BICR or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Randomization up to approximately 28 months|Overall Survival (OS), Defined as the time from randomization until the date of death due to any cause., Randomization up to approximately 41 months
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) assessed by Investigator, Defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression per RECIST 1.1 based on investigator or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Randomization up to approximately 28 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR) assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), Defined as the percentage of patients who achieve complete response(CR) or partial response (PR), as assessed by BICR per RECIST 1.1, Randomization up to approximately 28 months|Disease control rate (DCR) assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), Defined as the percentage of patients who achieve CR, PR or stable disease (SD), as assessed by BICR per RECIST 1.1, Randomization up to approximately 28 months|Duration of Response (DoR) assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), Defined as the time from the date of first documented CR or PR until date of documented disease progression per RECIST 1.1, as assessed by BICR or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Randomization up to approximately 28 months|Time to Response (TTR) assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), Defined as the time from the date of randomization until the first documentation of CR or PR as assessed by BICR per RECIST 1.1., Randomization up to approximately 28 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR) assessed by Investigator, Defined as the percentage of patients who achieve complete response(CR) or partial response (PR), as assessed by investigator per RECIST 1.1, Randomization up to approximately 28 months|Disease control rate (DCR) assessed by Investigator, Defined as the percentage of patients who achieve CR, PR or stable disease (SD), as assessed by investigator per RECIST 1.1, Randomization up to approximately 28 months|Duration of Response (DoR) assessed by Investigator, Defined as the time from the date of first documented CR or PR until date of documented disease progression per RECIST 1.1, as assessed by investigator or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Randomization up to approximately 28 months|Time to Response (TTR) assessed by Investigator, Defined as the time from the date of randomization until the first documentation of CR or PR as assessed by investigator per RECIST 1.1., Randomization up to approximately 28 months|Quality of life evaluated using the NCC-BC-A scale, To assess the impact of ESG401 on disease related symptoms and quality of life of patients using the NCC-BC-A scale, Randomization up to approximately 28 months|Adverse events(AEs) and severe adverse events (SAEs), Incidence and severity of AEs and SAEs (per CTCAE 5.0), and clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings, From signing the ICF up to last dose plus 30 days|Clearance, Mean population clearance will be derived from pooled data of drug concentrations. Covariates of influence on drug clearance will be incorporated within a population pharmacokinetic model., Randomization up to approximately 28 months|Volume of distribution, Mean population volume of distribution will be derived from pooled data of drug concentrations. Covariates of influence on volume of distribution will be incorporated within a population pharmacokinetic model., Randomization up to approximately 28 months|Anti-drug Antibodies, Incidence of anti-drug antibodies., Randomization up to approximately 28 months
This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter Phase 3 study to evaluate ESG401 versus Investigator's Choice Chemotherapy (ICC) as first-line treatment in subjects with unresectable recurrent or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.
