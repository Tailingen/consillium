A Study Evaluating the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetic and Efficacy of HLX301(TIGIT×PDL1 Bispecific) in Locally Advanced/Metastatic Solid Tumors or Lymphoma
A Phase 1/2 Study of HLX301, A Recombinant Humanized Anti-PDL1 and Anti-TIGIT Bispecific Antibody, in patients with locally advanced/metastatic solid tumors or lymphoma.Up to 150 patients will be included in this study. Up to 30 DLT evaluable patients will be enrolled in phase 1a (dose escalation), 40 per-protocol treated patients in phase 1b (dose expansion), and 80 per-protocol treated patients in phase 2. Phase 1a to evaluate safety, dose limiting toxicity (DLT), and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of HLX301 in patients with advanced or metastatic tumors who have failed or are intolerant to standard therapy, or for whom no standard therapy is available.Phase 1b to identify the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of HLX301 in patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC who have failed or are intolerant to standard therapy, or for whom no standard therapy is available.

Phase 2 to evaluate the anti-tumor activity of HLX301 in patients with histologically or cytologically-confirmed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), gastric/esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma (GC/EGJ), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), or urothelial carcinoma (UC) tumors that express PD-L1, after one or two prior systemic treatments and without standard therapy。
