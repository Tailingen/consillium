Safety and Efficacy Study of CI-135 CAR-T Cells in Subjects with Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This is a FIH, single center, open label, non-randomized, single-arm, Phase I clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CI-135 CAR-T cells in subjects with relapsed or refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. This study is a dose-escalation study that includes 2 dose levels, and a total of 4-7 subjects will be enrolled. CI-135 CAR-T cells will be manufactured using PBMC collected from the subjects, and will be infused intravenously into subjects after lymphodepletion.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: CI-135 CAR-T cells (0.5 x 10^6 CAR-T+ cells/kg，1.0 x 10^6 CAR-T+ cells/kg)
Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), 28 days post intravenous infusion
Adverse events, Incidence and severity of adverse events as assessed by NCI-CTCAE 5.0, until two years after cell infusion|Concentration of PK CAR positive T cells in peripheral blood, PK CAR positive T cells in peripheral blood, PK CAR transgene levels in peripheral blood, until two years after cell infusion|Pharmacodynamic data in peripheral blood, Time profile of CAR positive T cells concentrations in peripheral blood, until two years after cell infusion|Objective response rate (ORR), Objective response rate (ORR), until two years after cell infusion|Duration of remission (DOR) after infusion, refers to the time from the first assessment of CR or PR to the first assessment of disease progression or death from any cause, until two years after cell infusion|Progression-free survival (PFS) after infusion, refers to the time from cell infusion to the first assessment of tumor progression or recurrence or death from any cause, until two years after cell infusion|Overall survival (OS) after infusion, efers to the time from cell infusion to death due to any cause. For subjects who have dropped out before death, the dates of their last visit would be counted as their time of death; if the subject receives other new treatments, the time of death will be calculated based on the start date of the new treatment; if the study ends, the time of death will be calculated based on the end date, until two years after cell infusion|Time of human anti-mouse antibody production persist in human body （Immunogenicity）, Immunogenicity will be analyzed during the study, including the time of human anti-mouse antibody production and how long will it last in the body., until two years after cell infusion
