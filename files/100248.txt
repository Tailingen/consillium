Endoscopic Ultrasound-guided RadioFrequency Ablation for the Treatment Pancreatic NeuroEndocrine Neoplasms
This study evaluates the possibility and the safety of performing local therapy for Pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (PanNENs) using radiofrequency ablation of the tumor under ultrasonography (EUS) guidance.

DEVICE: EUS guided radiofrequency ablation
Incidence of adverse events (AEs) after EUS-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA), AEs will be classified as procedural when they occur during the procedure; post-procedural when they will occur up to 14 days after the procedure; late when they will occur more than 14 days after the procedure. Minor AEs will be those that need no therapy and have no sequelae (A) or have minor therapy or consequence, including overnight admission (B). Major events include those that require major therapy or hospitalization (24- 48 hours) (C); major therapy, need unplanned increase in level of care, or hospitalization \>48 hours (D); or result in permanent adverse sequelae (E) and death (F)., 1 year

Pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (PanNENs) are rare, but their incidence has significantly increased in the last decades. The mainstay treatment of PanNENs is surgery, which is associated with a significant benefit in term of survival but also with significant short- and long-term adverse events.

Based on the above data, less invasive alternative therapeutic interventions to avoid short- and long-term adverse events of surgery are needed.

In this context radiofrequency ablation has been reported to be effective in the treatment of these tumors in absence of major adverse events. However, the available studies on the matter are limited by small sample size and lack of standardized criteria for patient selection.
