Microbiome Immunotherapy Neoadjuvant Assessment
Predictive biomarkers of response to combination chemotherapy and immune-checkpoint inhibitors are urgently needed to help tailor treatment recommendations for patients with early-stage TNBC. Tumour-associated microbiota in primary breast tumours represent promising and novel candidate biomarkers modulators of the efficacy of therapies for patients with TNBC. It has been shown that microbes colonizing breast tumours can modulate the efficacy of commonly used drugs and that the microbiome of breast tissue biopsies could represent a new biomarker. Data on the microbiome of patients with cancer indicate the potential for a new class of bacteria-based oncological biomarkers, for exploitation in precision oncology.
Triple Negative Breast Cancer
To evaluate the breast cancer microbiome pre- and post-therapy, in patients with early stage TNBC undergoing neoadjuvant systemic therapy, Microbiome evaluation with metagenomic sequencing to assess changes in the relative abundance of microbial taxa (measured as percentage abundance per microbial species and changes in percentage abundance between baseline and post-therapy timepoints), Through study completion, an average of 1 year
To examine the relationship between the local breast cancer microbiome in early-stage triple negative breast cancer and pathologic complete response, Correlation between breast microbiome composition (measured as percent abundance of microbial taxa derived from metagenomic sequencing) and pathologic complete response rate (pCR), Through study completion, an average of 1 year|To examine the relationship between the local breast cancer microbiome in early-stage triple negative breast cancer and event-free survival, Correlation between breast microbiome composition (measured as percent abundance of microbial taxa derived from metagenomic sequencing) and event free survival (EFS), Through study completion, an average of 1 year|To examine the relationship between the local breast cancer microbiome in early-stage triple negative breast cancer and overall survival, Correlation between breast microbiome composition (measured as percent abundance of microbial taxa derived from metagenomic sequencing) and overall survival (OS), Through study completion, an average of 1 year|To determine the relationship between the breast cancer microbiome and tumor infiltrating leukocytes (TILs), Correlation between breast microbiome composition (measured as percent abundance of microbial taxa derived from metagenomic sequencing) and TILS (\<50% versus ≥50%), Through study completion, an average of 1 year|To determine the relationship between the breast cancer microbiome and programmed death ligand -1 (PDL-1), Correlation between breast microbiome composition (measured as percent abundance of microbial taxa derived from metagenomic sequencing) and , PDL1 (positive defined as CPS ≥ 1 by PD-L1 IHC 22C3 assay versus negative), Through study completion, an average of 1 year|To evaluate the gut microbiome pre- and post-therapy, in patients with early stage TNBC undergoing neoadjuvant systemic therapy, Change in the gut microbiome composition (measured as percent abundance of microbial taxa derived from metagenomic sequencing) between pre- and post-therapy, Through study completion, an average of 1 year
