UARK 2013-05 A Study of Autologous Expanded Natural Killer Cell Therapy for Asymptomatic Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and in vivo persistence and expansion of autologous and expansion of autologous, ex vivo expanded-natural killer(ENK) cells.
Asymptomatic Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: ENK Cell Infusion
Increase in ENK (Expanded Natural Killer Cells) Cells 7 Days After Treatment, Number of participants with at least 4 fold increase in absolute CD3-CD56+ NK cell count/uL blood 7 days after infusion over the pre-study baseline level, 7 days
To determine whether significant in vivo expansion of auto-ENK cells occurs, defined as a \> 4 fold increase in absolute cluster of differentiation 3(CD3)-cluster of differentiation 56 (CD56+) NK cell count/blood 7 days after infusion over the pre-study baseline level and the safety of the ENK cell therapy in research participants with high-risk asymptomatic multiple myeloma (AMM) defined as gene expression profile (GEP) 70 gene score\>-0.26.
