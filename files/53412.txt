[18F]FLT PET/CT in Rb+ Metastatic Breast Cancer
In this study positron emission tomography (PET/CT) imaging will be used to evaluate proliferative activity in sites of metastatic disease using the investigational radiotracer \[18F\]fluorothymidine (FLT).

Measure changes in [18F]FLT uptake in metastatic tumors before and during treatment with ribociclib (LEE011) only, patient will have FLT PET/CT scan at baseline, run-in day -3, and cycle 1, day 1 of ribociclib (LEE011)/paclitaxel therapy, Measure changes in \[18F\]FLT uptake in metastatic tumors before and during treatment with ribociclib (LEE011) only and associate these changes with response to ribociclib (LEE011)/paclitaxel therapy., 4 years
Measure changes in [18F]FLT uptake in metastatic tumors during and after treatment with ribociclib (LEE011) only, patient will have FLT PET/CT scan at baseline, run-in day -3, and cycle 1, day 1 of ribociclib (LEE011)/paclitaxel therapy, Measure changes in \[18F\]FLT uptake in metastatic tumors during and after treatment with ribociclib (LEE011) only and associate these changes with response to ribociclib (LEE011)/paclitaxel therapy., 4 years
This protocol is designed to develop relationships between parameters determined from imaging biomarker studies and ones used for determination of therapeutic response to combined CDK4 Inhibitor and chemotherapy regimens. Imaging will occur prior to starting therapy on the separate therapeutic protocol UPCC 06115. Patients may undergo a second FLT PET/CT scan following a 3-day run of ribociclib (LEE011) (day -6 to -4) and a third FLT PET/CT scan on cycle 1 day 12 following two treatments of weekly Paclitaxel to compare changes in FLT uptake measures.
