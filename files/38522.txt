This study is a study of Max-40279-01 in combination with toripalimab in patients with advanced solid tumors. This study includes two Parts, the Part 1 will assess the safety and efficacy of the preset several dose levels of Max-40279-01 and toripalimab, and recommend a dose level of Max-40279-01 combined toripalimab for stage 2. The part 2 is designed to study the efficacy and safety of max-40279-01 combined toripalimab in advanced solid tumors or certain specific tumors.
