This is a multicenter, open-label, prospective Phase 1/2a study to assess safety and tolerability, establish dosimetry and to identify an optimal imaging dose (radioactivity and mass dose) and imaging time window of 64Cu-LNTH-1363S (64Cu Radiolabeled FAPi PET/CT Imaging Agent) and to compare its imaging biodistribution with FAP expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in patients with sarcomas or GIT cancers. The study will be conducted in 2 parts (Part 1 and Part 2).

Each patient will receive either 8 ± 1 mCi /\~50 μg or 8 ± 1 mCi/\~90 μg of 64Cu-LNTH-1363S. The raw data of each patient PET scan will be re-processed using a computer program to simulate scans of the same patient with lower injected activities (6 and 4 mCi)., During serial PET/CT scans taken on Day 1 at the following timepoints at 0.5 hour ± 10 minutes, 1 hour ±10 minutes, 2 hours ± 15 minutes, 4 to 6 hours, and 24 hours ± 4 hours post study intervention administration.|Primary Part 2 - Correlation of 64Cu-LNTH-1363S biodistribution with Immunohistochemistry FAP expression, Correlation of 64Cu-LNTH-1363S (64Cu Radiolabeled FAPi PET/CT Imaging Agent) biodistribution with FAP expression by IHC (SUVmean and SUVmax vs IHC score) and compare to circulating FAP in blood as analyzed by ELISA method., Post surgery tissue collection to end of study

* Changes in electrocardiogram (ECG)parameters

  • Exposure-response relationships:
* Relationship of AEs to exposure (dose and concentrations)., Part1: From IP administration until the Day 7 (± 1 day) telephone follow up.

Validation to be completed on image quality score of first 6 patients, if optimal radioactivity determined in Part 1 is less than 8 ± 1 mCi., From start of Part 2 to 6 patients enrolled with qualifying imaging
Exploratory Part 1 and Part 2, Develop an AI system for detecting and characterizing cancer lesion(s) expressing FAP using 64Cu-LNTH-1363S, through Correlation between automated measurement of physiological uptake of 64Cu-LNTH-1363S with manual measurement results; and through the determination of the detection rate of possible site of cancer lesion(s) with 64Cu-LNTH-1363S using an AI enabled reading system when compared to central reader assessments.

Part 2: Estimation of total tumor burden using an AI enabled reading system., From post study intervention administration imaging in each patient (0.5 hour ± 10 minutes, 1 hour ±10 minutes, 2 hours ± 15 minutes, 4 to 6 hours, and 24 hours ± 4 hours in Part 1 and 2 timepoints in Part 2) to the end of the study].
Part 1 will determine the biodistribution, dosimetry, optimal dose (radioactivity and mass dose) and imaging time window of 64Cu-LNTH-1363S in 12 evaluable patients with supposed FAP-expressing solid tumors (metastatic sarcomas). Two 64Cu-LNTH-1363S mass doses of \~50 μg and \~90 μg will be studied. Six patients will receive 8 ± 1 millicurie (mCi) (\~50 μg mass dose), followed by another 6 patients will receive 8 ± 1 mCi (\~90 μg mass dose). Two additional radioactivity (6 and 4 mCi) doses will be simulated by reprocessing raw data from each patient's PET scans.

This study does not involve randomization for dose groups. It will commence with the lower dose group (\~50 μg mass dose). After enrolling 6 evaluable patients in this dose group, recruitment for the next dose group (\~90 μg mass dose) will begin and conclude upon enrolling 6 evaluable patients. Subsequently, the images will undergo analysis by blinded central readers.

Part 1 of the study will last approximately 3 weeks for each patient and includes a Screening Period (up to 14 days), a 1-day Intervention Period, and a Safety Follow-up Period (7 days post dose).

Part 2 will evaluate 64Cu-LNTH-1363S imaging correlation with FAP expression measured by IHC (SUVmax and SUVmean vs IHC score) in 20 evaluable patients with non-metastatic, operable, supposed FAP-expressing solid tumors (sarcomas, esophageal, gastric, pancreatic, colorectal) planned for surgery within 60 days (from study imaging). If the optimal radioactivity determined from Part 1 is less than 8 ± 1 mCi, the first 6 patients in Part 2 will be used to validate this optimal radioactivity. This mean the image quality scores of the first 6 patients will need to be calculated. If the sum of the average image quality scores of the 6 patients is higher or equal to 10.5, then the lower optimal radioactivity determined in Part 1 will be used for the remaining 14 patients, otherwise the remaining 14 patients in Part 2 will be injected with 8 ± 1 mCi of 64Cu-LNTH-1363S. Part 2 of the study will last approximately 10 to 11 weeks for each patient and includes: a Screening Period (up to 14 days), a 1-day Intervention Period, a 1-day Safety Follow-up Period (Day 2), and a Scheduled Surgery: IHC Sample Collection Period (from Day 2 to Day 60).

Both Part 1 and Part 2 of the study will also monitor cardiac safety by detecting changes in HR, T wave, ST segment and other ECG parameters and look for signals suggesting a concentration-response relationship of 64Cu-LNTH-1363S for QT and corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation.
