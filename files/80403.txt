Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a relatively common and life threatening condition that affect one in thirteen individuals in their lifetime. Colonoscopy is the most used procedure to allow gastroenterologist to identify colorectal malignancies or precancerous lesions at an earlier stage, which affords a greater chance for cure. However, low bowel cleanliness hinders polyp detection rates and therefore colonoscopy effectiveness. In the past, the majority of the studies have focused on pharmacological factors to optimize bowel preparation quality. Recently, the non-pharmacological factors have been found to have significant increases in bowel preparation quality. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the GI clinic's currently used web-based instructions at St. Paul's Hospital.
