LND101 for Fecal Microbiota Transplantation in Combination With Immune Checkpoint Blockade in Advanced Melanoma
This study is being done to answer the following question: Can the chance of melanoma growing or spreading be lowered by receiving a treatment called LND101 for Fecal Microbiota Transplant (FMT) in addition to the usual immunotherapy treatment called Immune Checkpoint Blockade (ICB)? FMT treatment changes the bacteria in your gut called the microbiome.
Melanoma
DRUG: Standard of Care Immune Checkpoint Blockade|DRUG: LND101
Progression-free Survival, 4 years
Overall Survival, 4 years|Objective Response Rate, 4 years|Number and severity of adverse events assessed with CTCAE version 5.0, 4 years
We are doing this study because we want to find out if this approach (adding LND101 FMT to ICB) is better or worse than the usual approach (ICB only) for advanced melanoma. The usual approach is defined as care most people get for advanced melanoma.

The usual approach for patients who are not in a study is treatment with immunotherapy drugs called immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) drugs. Immunotherapy works by activating the immune system to target the cancer. This may help to slow down the growth of cancer and may cause cancer cells to die.
