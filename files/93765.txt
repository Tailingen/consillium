PhII ICb With/Without Erbitux in MBC Pts
The purpose of this study is to determine the objective response rates produced by irinotecan and carboplatin therapy with or without Erbitux in patients with Metastatic Breast Cancer.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Irinotecan + Carboplatin|DRUG: irinotecan + Carboplatin + erbitux
Objective Response Rates (ORR), To determine the objective response rates (CR + PR). Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD., 2 years
Duration of Response, The duration of response is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR/PR until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented.

Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or the date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months.|Median Time of Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS is measured from the date of randomization to the date of first documented disease progression or date of death, whichever comes first. If a patient neither progresses nor dies, this patient will be censored at last contact date., 2 years|Median Overall Survival (OS), OS is measured from the date of randomization to the date of death for a dead patient. If a patient is still alive or is lost to follow up, the patient will be censored at the last contact date., 2 years
The purpose of this study is to determine the objective response rates produced by irinotecan and carboplatin therapy with or without Erbitux in patients with Metastatic Breast Cancer.
