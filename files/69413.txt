18F-LN1 PET/CT in Urothelial Carcinomas
The clinical feasibility of 18F-LN1 PET/CT will be evaluated in 30 patients with urothelial carcinoma, and the results will be compared with those of 18F-FDG.
Urothelial Carcinoma
Comparison of 18F-LN1 and 18F-FDG Uptake in Patients with urothelial carcinoma, The correlation between the results of PET images and histopathological results, 1 mouth
This study aims to evaluate the recognition efficiency of 18F-LN1 and 18F-FDG PET imaging for tumor target Nectin-4 in patients with urothelial carcinoma. The main method is to compare the results of visually interpreted PET images with histopathological results (through surgery or biopsy), which are the gold standard for final diagnosis.
