Long-term Ovarian Fertility in Patients Treated for Lymphoma.
This is an observational, single-center, longitudinal cohort study. In order to evaluate the gonadotoxicity of chemotherapy, an AMH monitoring was initiated in 2006 in our fertility observatory in young patients with lymphoma before, during and after chemotherapy. This study is part of the project "She will get better and then want a child" and is supported by the ARS hauts de France (n° DOS/SDES/AR/FIR/2019/282). Our first study published in 2010 shows that AMH decreases sharply during chemotherapy, regardless of the chemotherapy protocol. At the end of chemotherapy, AMH recovery profiles differ according to the protocol received. This follow-up is therefore essential in order to adapt our practices and our preservation strategies, particularly to the type of chemotherapy. Patients are primarily concerned about their chances of subsequent pregnancy, and there is little evidence in the literature about the impact of chemotherapy on ovarian reserve and long-term fertility.

The fisrt objective of our study is to evaluate, at distance from chemotherapy, the evolution of ovarian function in patients treated for lymphoma by evaluating follicular reserve parameters (AMH and antral follicle count) at 5 and 10 years after the end of chemotherapy compared with the initial workup performed before chemotherapy and the workup performed at 12 months after the end of chemotherapy.
