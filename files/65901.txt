A Phase I Dose Escalation Study of the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of LAM-002A In Patients With Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
This is a Phase 1 dose-exploration study of LAM-002A administered by mouth in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell NHL. Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD),and preliminary anti-tumor activity will be evaluated.
Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin; Leukemia, Chronic Lymphocytic
DRUG: LAM-002A|DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Atezolizumab
Determination of the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Continuous Oral LAM-002A, MTD was determined by testing increasing doses up to 125 mg twice a day or 75 mg three times a day orally on dose escalation cohorts with 3 to 6 participants each. In the dose escalation, the cohort sizes of 3 to 6 subjects allow evaluation of regimen safety using a standard definition of MTD (ie, the highest starting dose associated with DLT in \<33% of subjects during the first cycle of therapy) when administered continuously (daily administration) and then when administered intermittently (repeated courses of 3 days on and 4 days off)., 28 days
Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of LAM-002A, Evaluation of the peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of LAM-002A and its metabolites in plasma on Day 1 and Day 8., 8 days|Area Under the Plasma Concentration Versus Time Curve (AUC) of LAM-002A, Evaluation of the Area under the concentration-time curve from time-zero to the time of the last quantifiable concentration (AUClast) of LAM-002ALAM-002A and its metabolites in plasma on Day 1 and Day 8., 8 days|Objective Response Rate, Anti-tumor response as assessed by investigator according to modified Hallek or Lugano Response Criteria by Disease Type and Cohort, 1 cycle (28 days) up to a maximum of 24 cycles
LAM-002A is supplied as 25-mg or 50-mg capsules and will be administered two times daily or three times daily by mouth in repeated 28-day cycles. Patients will be advised to take the doses at the same time each day.

A 3 + 3 design will be utilized to define a maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The MTD is defined as the highest dose at which no more than 1 of 6 patients (i.e., \< 33%) experiences a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in the dose cohort.

Once the dose and schedule are established, additional patients will be treated to better characterize the safety, tolerability,PK, PD, and anti-tumor activity of LAM-002A when administered alone or in combination with rituximab or atezolizumab.
