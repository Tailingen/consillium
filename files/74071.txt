This is a 4-part dose escalation and dose expansion study of BDC-3042 as a single agent and in combination with cemiplimab in patients with advanced malignancies. Phase 1 includes two separate parts: a dose escalation study to evaluate BDC-3042 as a single agent (Part 1) and a combination dose escalation study with cemiplimab (Part 2) to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), or maximum protocol dose (MPD). Dependent on the results of Phase 1, the study may proceed into Phase 2. Phase 2 is a dose expansion study of BDC-3042 as a single agent (Part 3) and in combination with cemiplimab (Part 4) at the MTD, RP2D or MPD.

Recruitment for Phase 1, Part 1 is currently on hold and recruitment for Part 2 has not been initiated. The Phase 2, Parts 3 and 4, will not be initiated until full completion of Part 2 of the Phase 1 study.
