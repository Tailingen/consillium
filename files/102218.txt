Screening for Prostate Cancer Among Those Prostate-specific Antigen Value Between 2.5 and 4.0 ng/mL
The study aims to evaluate the detection rate and characteristics of prostate cancer among males with PSA values between 2.5 and 4.0 ng/mL in Nanjing, meanwhile, to access the effectiveness of conducting multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) after PSA assay.
Prostate Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: mpMRI scanning
Incidence of prostate cancer, among PSA between 2.5 and 4.0 ng/ml, 3 years
The investigators are going to collect serum samples and clinical information from men aged ≥50 years in community health service centers in Nanjing. The investigators will propose mpMRI for those met our criteria of PSA values between 2.5 and 4.0 ng/ml. Transperineal systematic biopsy and MRI/ultrasound fusion targeted biopsy will be offered for those who scored ≥3 points on the Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System Version 2 (PI-RADS v2). Follow-up examinations annually will be offered for those with a PI-RADS score \<3. Sequences obtained while conducting mpMRI included T2-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, and dynamic contrast-enhanced using a 3.0-T system.
