Combined Treatment of Treated Bile Duct Cancer
The study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of envelizumab in combination with sovalteinib in the treatment of treated bile duct cancer, and explore treatment options to improve patient survival, while the study will attempt to explore the characteristics of the population benefiting from the treatment, and construct a preliminary efficacy prediction model by detecting markers in blood to provide a theoretical basis for implementing precise treatment.
