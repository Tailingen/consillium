Laparoscopic Ultra-radical Lymph Node Debulking Using Yasargil Clamps (Yasargil-1)
Although several studies have demonstrated the overall benefits of a laparoscopic approach for pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy, complications remain a challenging scenario. Vascular injury occurs in 0.3% to 1.0% of laparoscopic procedures, with potentially lethal consequences. Vascular injuries are usually managed using coagulation, clamps or vascular sutures, but if these measures fail, laparotomy is inevitable.

To date, few reports evaluated the use of minimally invasive surgery for lymph node debulking in gynecological cancer patients with metastatic bulky lymph nodes, with encouraging results, despite the small sample sizes. Nevertheless, new minimally invasive surgery techniques that may minimize intraoperative complications are necessary. Considering these elements, this multicenter retrospective analysis is aimed to evaluate intra- and post-operative surgical outcomes, after laparoscopic ultraradical lymph nodal debulking using Yasargil clamps in gynecological cancer patients with bulky lymph node metastases.
