Cetuximab, Gemcitabine, and Oxaliplatin in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Cetuximab may also stop the growth of pancreatic cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine and oxaliplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving cetuximab together with combination chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well giving cetuximab together with gemcitabine and oxaliplatin works in treating patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer.

BIOLOGICAL: Cetuximab|DRUG: Gemcitabine Hydrochloride|DRUG: Oxaliplatin
Progression-free survival, The corresponding progression-free survival curve and cumulative risk of progression as a function of time post treatment initiation will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, The cumulative percentage of intent to treat patients who experience disease progression at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 months will be characterized with corresponding 95% confidence intervals
Toxicity, Frequency and severity of adverse events according to the NCI CTCAE V 3.0 body system and severity criteria will be described.|Response rate (complete response and partial response), The response rate will be determined by the RECIST criteria. After every 4th cycle; End of Treatment and Follow-up, After every 4th cycle; End of Treatment and Follow-up|Duration of response, the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever status is recorded first) until the first date that recurrence or PD is objectively documented, taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, The time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever status is recorded first) until the first date that recurrence or PD is objectively documented|Overall survival, Overall survival will also be estimated using the product-limit method of Kaplan-Meier., Overall survival will also be estimated using the product-limit method of Kaplan-Meier.|Time to progression, The time from the start of the treatment until the criteria for disease progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started (also referred to in the RECIST criteria as duration of stable disease)., The time from the start of the treatment until the criteria for disease progression are met
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine the progression-free survival of patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer treated with cetuximab, gemcitabine hydrochloride, and oxaliplatin.

Secondary

* Determine the complete response and partial response in patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the time to progression in patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the duration of response in patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the survival of patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, open-label, pilot study.

Patients receive cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours on days 1 and 8, gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 100 minutes on day 1, and oxaliplatin IV over 2-4 hours on day 2. Treatment repeats every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
