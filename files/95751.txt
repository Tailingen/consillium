This is a non-interventional study using interviews to explore head and neck cancer patients' experience of preparing for and completing radiotherapy utilising an immobilisation mask.

The study will be conducted in 2 stages:

The first stage is Item generation. Approximately 20 interviews will be conducted with head and neck cancer patients who have completed or partially completed radiotherapy. The interviews will capture their experiences and views pertaining to mould making, scans and radiotherapy, reported associated fear of restriction, suffocation, loss of control and fear of public embarrassment during treatment.

The data from the interviews will be used to develop potential items for a screening tool for identification of those patients likely to experience anxiety and claustrophobia before they start their treatment.

The second stage is cognitive interviews. Approximately 5 patients included in Stage I will be invited to take part in a further interview to review the themes and potential questionnaire items identified from interviews.
