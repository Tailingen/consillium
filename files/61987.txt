A Phase II Study of Docetaxel and Carboplatin in Late Relapse of Ovarian Cancer
A phase II single arm study of carboplatin and docetaxel in treatment of first sensitive relapse of epithelial ovarian, peritoneal or tubal cancer.

Hypothesis: Treatment with this combination in second line is safe and with a low frequency of neurologic side effect.
Ovarian Epithelial Cancer Recurrent
DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Docetaxel
Safety, Safety will be established by grading the observed toxicities using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC Version 2.0). All toxicities observed within 30 dayes of last chemocourse will be included., Up to 30 days after last chemotherapy course
Response rate, Response rate according to Resist 1.0 Response rate is the proportion of patients that achieve CR or PR., Up to 30 dayes after last chemotherapy course|Progression free survival, Time from start of treatment to the earlier date of assessment of progression or death by any cause., Up to 3 year
Evaluation of toxicity and response of treatment with carboplatin and docetaxel to patients with epithelial cancer of ovary, fallopian tube or peritoneum with their first relapse occurring at least 6 months after end of first line treatment- Evaluation of toxicity according to Clinical Toxicity Criteria version 2.
