Massive Nasal Bleeding in Patients With NPC Received Curative RT
To investigate the incidence, predictive markers, and survival impact of massive nasal bleeding in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients who received curative radiotherapy (RT) with/without chemotherapy. A total of 1327 patients with previously untreated, biopsy-proven NPC, and no distant metastasis were retrospective reviewed. Investigators analyzed the occurrence rates of massive nasal bleeding between different characteristics and tried to identify important predictive factors. Investigators compared overall survival between patients with and without massive nasal bleeding by Kaplan-Meier method.

Massive Nasal Bleeding Rate, Massive Nasal Bleeding Rate among different characteristics. Massive Nasal Bleeding was defined as unique blood loss \> 300 ml or recurrent blood losses \> 100 ml., From date of radiotherapy until the date of first documented massive bleeding, assessed up to 360 months
Overall Survival, Overall Survival, From date of radiotherapy until the date of last clinic visit or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 360 months
