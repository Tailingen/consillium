Safety, Efficacy, & Pharmacokinetic Study of Tamibarotene to Treat Patients With Relapsed or Refractory APL
This is a Phase II, open-label, non-randomized study to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of tamibarotene in adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) following treatment with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO). Patients must have received and failed therapy with ATRA and ATO. Treatment may have been administered either as combination therapy or sequentially as single agents. Patients who are intolerant to either drug are eligible for this study.
