Exercise Intervention Among Men With Prostate Cancer Initiating Androgen Deprivation Therapy
This research study is evaluating the impact and feasibility of a 12-week brisk walking and moderate strength training exercise intervention including a virtual component in men who are initiating androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is a key treatment of prostate cancer. While this therapy improves prostate cancer outcomes, ADT also has a variety of short- and long-term adverse effects, including increased body weight, loss of lean muscle mass, reductions in quality of life, and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Studies have shown that among men with prostate cancer, physical activity is associated with improved outcomes, including a reduced risk of mortality, from prostate cancer and other causes. Our hypothesis is that physical activity will improve some of the physical and emotional side effects associated with ADT. Physical activity, such as brisk walking and moderate strength training, offers a lifestyle factor that may improve some of the side effects, and is low-cost and easy to do.

The investigators are conducting this study to evaluate the impact and feasibility of a 12-week moderate-intensity aerobic and strength training exercise intervention, including a virtual component. The intervention includes brisk walking and moderate strength training, and involves home-based exercises, in-person sessions with an oncology-trained exercise physiologist, optional group training sessions, and weekly training goals. Participants will have access to a personalized web-based platform called Postwire, which will include videos of training sessions, and will allow participants to easily communicate with the study staff and with other study participants.
