Novel Synthetic T2W MR Imaging and Spin Parameter Mapping Techniques for Screening Prostate Cancer
This clinical trial studies examines a 3D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compared to standard MRI imaging techniques in screening patients with prostate cancer. Diagnostic procedures, such as MRI, may help find and diagnose prostate cancer. Computer systems that allow doctors to create a 3-dimensional (3-D) picture of the tumor may help in planning.
Prostate Adenocarcinoma|Prostate Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: Magnetic Resonance Imaging
To be assessed with scoring of quantitative image metrics in regions of prostate cancer and benign tissue, Comparing the 2-dimensional (2D) T2W imaging technique without endorectal coil.

Scored from 1 to 5 with PI-RADS 1 indicating that csPCa is highly unlikely whereas a PI-RADS 5 score indicates that csPCa is highly likely to be present., through study completion, an average of 1 year
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To determine whether the image quality of the novel 3-dimensional (3D) T2-weighted imaging (T2W) synthetic imaging technique without endorectal coil is comparable to the 2-dimensional (2D) T2W imaging technique without endorectal coil.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To evaluate the qualitative diagnostic quality of the T2W images provided by the novel 3D technique, as determined by subjective scoring by experienced readers.

EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

I. To investigate the feasibility of novel 3D synthetic imaging and multi-spin parameter mapping technique of prostate for the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa).

OUTLINE:

Patients undergo 3D MRI imaging over 15 minutes with standard of care MRI or at a separate time.
