This study is an open-label, single-arm, multi-center Phase I clinical study, which includes four stages:

A: Dose-escalation Stage: The dose escalation stage is divided into 5 dose levels, and a Bayesian Optimal Interval Design (BOIN) including accelerated titration will be used for dose escalation.

B: PK Expansion Stage: Two or three dose groups will be selected for PK expansion; After PK extension the cohort extension study will be conducted as required, and will include 4 cohorts according to the tumor types.

C: Combination dose Escalation: This study will use a 3+3 design with up to 2 dose escalation cohorts at increasing levels.

D: According to the results of stage C, 1-2 combination doses will be selected for combination dose expansion, and Simon 2 stage was adopted for the expansion stage.
