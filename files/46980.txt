CHIO3 Trial: CHemotherapy Combined With Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor for Operable Stage IIIA/B Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a single arm, phase II trial of combined neoadjuvant platinum doublet chemotherapy plus durvalumab followed by surgery, postoperative radiation and adjuvant durvalumab for 13 cycles for patients with potentially resectable stage IIIA and IIIB (T1-3, N2) NSCLC (per the 8th International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer classification). The primary objective of this study is to increase N2 nodal clearance (N2NC) to 50% or greater for combined platinum doublet chemotherapy with durvalumab induction therapy from historical rate of 30% for platinum doublet chemotherapy alone in patients with potentially resectable stage IIIA/B (N2) NSCLC.

Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, To evaluate the safety and tolerability of neoadjuvant platinum doublet chemotherapy and durvalumab followed by surgery followed by adjuvant radiation and durvalumab., 5 years|Radiographic response rate, To assess the radiographic response rate of neoadjuvant platinum doublet chemotherapy and durvalumab., 5 years|Rate of major pathologic response and pathologic complete response, To evaluate the rate of major pathologic response and pathologic complete response in the resected primary tumor and lymph nodes following neoadjuvant combination therapy., 16 weeks|Evaluate event free survival (EFS), EFS evaluated from the time of registration to one of the following events, whichever comes first: a) radiographic disease progression, b) local progression as defined by lymph node progression precluding surgery, c) inability to resect the tumor, d) local or distant recurrence, e) death due to any cause., 5 years|Overall survival rate, To evaluate overall survival rate from the time of registration, 5 years|Rate of complete resection., To assess the rate of complete resection., 16 weeks|Post-operative complications, To assess post-operative complications, Within 30 days of surgery
In the preoperative period, patients who have undergone adequate mediastinal evaluation and are considered operable will be treated with durvalumab 1125 mg IV every 3 weeks (Q3W) in combination with platinum doublet chemotherapy (cisplatin with pemetrexed or docetaxel, depending upon histology).

Patients will undergo postoperative radiation (54Gy) within 4-10 weeks after surgery (unless single station N2 at registration with resultant ypT0N0 after neoadjuvant therapy).

One to 6 weeks after completion of radiation, patients will receive adjuvant durvalumab 1500 mg IV every 4weeks (Q4W) for 1 year.

Patients who do not have surgery due to refusal, physician decision, or local and distant progression will have to discontinue study treatment.

All participants will have imaging assessment prior to surgery after Cycle 2 (Week 6) and after Cycle 4 (Weeks 13 15). Patients will undergo potentially curable surgery as per standard of care.

Patients will undergo imaging assessment every 12 weeks after surgery for 2 years, then every 6 months for 3 years.
