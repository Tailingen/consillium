MONOCENTRIC PERSPECTIVE STUDY: USE OF LIQUID BIOPSY WITH DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING
Evaluation of the diagnostic accuracy of Mammography in the morpho-structural analysis of mammographic images in breast cancer-diagnosed patients or patients in follow-up for breast cancer by extracting a number of features describing the texture and morphology of the lesions reported in the form of a structured report explicitly developed for the study. Correlation of the data obtained from evaluating the primary endpoint with the genetic/molecular analysis on liquid biopsy.
