Phase III Study (Tarceva®) vs Chemotherapy to Treat Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer in Patients With Mutations in the TK Domain of EGFR
A Phase III, multicenter, open-label, randomized trial of Erlotinib (Tarceva®) versus chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC with mutations in the Tyrosine Kinase (TK) domain of the EGFR.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Erlotinib|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Gemcitabin|DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Cisplatin
Progression Free-survival, The time from enrollment in the study to tumor progression or death from any cause (whichever occurs first), From the date of randomization to the date of last follow up, assessed up to 24 months
Objective Response, The objective response rate is defined as the percentage of patients who attain complete response (CR) or partial response (PR); response will be evaluated following RECIST criteria version 1.0.

Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive disease (PD): at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters recorded on study., From the date of randomization to the date of last follow up, assessed up to 24 months|Overall Survival, Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time, in months, from the inclusion date to the death date. A patient is censored at the last contact date if he/she does not die.Overall survival will be assessed from the date of enrollment in the study until the date of death from any cause. Patients lost to follow-up will be censured on the date of the last follow-up visit., From the date of randomization to the date of last follow up, assessed up to 24 months|Molecular Markers Related to EGFR and Study Pathology, The study of mutations in serum (serum DNA). This exploratory analysis was performed to determine whether EGFR mutations can reliably be detected in serum thereby reducing the requirement for invasive techniques as well as to enable detection of mutations in patients where no tumor biopsy samples are available., At baseline
This is a multicenter, phase III, randomized, open-label clinical trial.

146 patients with a diagnosis of advanced (stage IIIB and stage IV), non-squamous-cell, non-small-cell pulmonary carcinoma not treated previously for their disease with chemotherapy who present mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor, EGFR will be recluted.

The primary objective is to compare the progression-free survival in both treatment arms of the study (conventional chemotherapy vs. erlotinib) in patients with non-squamous-cell, non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in advanced stage (stages IIIB and stage IV) who have not received previous chemotherapy for their disease and who present mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).
