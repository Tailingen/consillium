Study of AMG 386 in Combination With Paclitaxel and Carboplatin in Subjects With Ovarian Cancer
To evaluate whether AMG 386 in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin is safe and well tolerated in the first-line treatment of high-risk stage I and stages II-IV epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal and fallopian tube cancers. The hypothesis is that AMG 386 in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel is safe and well tolerated.
