The Safety and Efficiency of Stent-based Diverting Technique Versus Ileostomy in Rectal Cancer Patients
The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and efficiency of stent-based tiverting technique (SDT) versus ileostomy in rectal cancer patients. After the removal of the rectal tumor, participants who are at high risk for anastomotic leakage will either undergo SDT or ileostomies. Researchers will compare SDT to see if SDT could help patients save hospital stays, lower medical costs, and enhance their quality of life, and not alternatively avoid defunction stoma.

Incidence of severe complications within 90-day, Clavein-Dindo≥III, Study group, from SDT to postoperative 90 days, Control group, from ileostomy to postoperative 90 days of reversal of stoma.
Total complications, Clavein-Dindo I to V, Study group, from SDT to postoperative 90 days; Control group, from ileostomy, plus interval time before stoma reversal, to postoperative 90 days of reversal of stoma|Clinical anastomotic leakage, Grade B or Grade C, Study group, from SDT to postoperative 90 days; Control group, from ileostomy, plus interval time before stoma reversal, to postoperative 90 days of reversal of stoma|Postoperative hospital stay, Postoperative hospital stay after SDT or ileostomy or reversal of stoma, Study group, from SDT to discharge, and adding second postoperative hospital stay if the patient received the ileostomy. Control group, from ileostomy to discharge and from stoma reversal to discharge，up to six months for both group|Total medical Costs, Including medical costs, surgery costs and other costs, From first admission to end of follow-up or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to six months for both group|Quality of life evaluation, SF-8 scale, Study group, 90 days after SDT; Control group, 90 days after ileostomy
In patients with rectal cancer who have a high risk of anastomotic leakage, we aim to compare the safety and effectiveness of SDT versus ileostomy in this study. The primary endpoint of the study was severe complications that occurred within 90 days of the surgery. The secondary endpoints included total complications, the incidence of coloanal anastomotic leakage (Grade B/C), postoperative hospital stay and cost, and postoperative quality of life evaluation.
