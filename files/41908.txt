CRTE7A2-01 TCR-T Cell for HPV-16 Positive Advanced Cervical, Anal, or Head and Neck Cancers
A single center, open, single arm dose escalation phase I study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of CRTE7A2-01 TCR-T cell for HPV16 positive advanced cervical, anal, or head and neck cancers. The study will determine MTD of CRTE7A2-01 TCR-T cell injection, as well as investigate RP2D.
