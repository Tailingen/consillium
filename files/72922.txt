Lipiodol Deposition Using Endhole vs. Pressure-Modulated Delivery
The goal of this clinical trial is to compare CT scan of the coverage of tumors treated with TACE using End Hole catheters to those treated with the TriNav catheter that alters tissue pressure. Both catheters are FDA approved for delivery of TACE.

â€¢ Is there a difference in CT appearance with delivery in the type of catheter used during the TACE procedure?

Participants will be asked to undergo a TACE procedure, a CT scan and review of their medical record to compare End Hole and TriNav catheters during TACE procedures.

DEVICE: TACE Catheters
volume and density of lipiodol, To estimate the relative volume and density of lipiodol deposition in hypervascular liver tumors, immediately following TACE
Hepatocellular (HCC) and neuroendocrine (NET) liver metastases undergoing Lipiodol transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) will be randomized to endhole vs. pressure-modulated catheter delivery. Lipiodol deposition will be quantified and correlated with volumetric necrosis, response, and local progression.
