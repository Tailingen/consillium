This is a multicenter study of ibrutinib (first-in-class, potent, covalently-binding inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase \[BTK\]) in female participants with B cell malignancy. The study consists of 3 phases: Screening Phase (up to 28 days), 7-day Pretreatment Phase (Days 1 to 7), Treatment Phase including PK assessment period (Days 8 to 26) and a Follow-up Phase (Day 27 to end of Cycle 6). The study procedures includes electrocardiogram (ECG), vital signs, blood samples withdrawal to evaluate PK and safety. The Antitumor activity will be assessed by means of computed tomography (CT) imaging and positron emission tomography (PET) scans. No formal statistical hypothesis will be tested. This is an estimation study designed to determine if an increase or decrease in exposure to OC or probe drugs occurs in the presence of ibrutinib.
