The Australia and New Zealand Multicentre Upper Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Tissue Resection Study
To determine the long term outcomes of Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD), Endoscopic Full Thickness Resection (EFTR) and Submucosal-Tunnelling Endoscopic Resection (STER) for upper gastrointestinal neoplastic lesions
Cancer of Stomach|Oesophageal Cancer|Gastric Cancer|Gastric Adenocarcinoma|GI Cancer|GIST|Neuroendocrine Tumors|Gastric Neoplasm|Esophageal Neoplasms
Effectiveness of endoscopic resection of UGI neoplastic lesions: completeness of resection, Determined based on clear margins in histology review, 2 weeks|Safety: intra and post procedural; bleeding; perforation; anaesthetic, Intraprocedural bleeding, clinically significant post-polypectomy bleeding, deep mural injury, post polypectomy coagulation syndrome, 30 day|Long term outcomes: recurrent and residual disease, Determined at subsequent procedures, 3 years
Endoscopic sessions, procedure time (in minutes) and overall time (in weeks) needed to achieve the primary objectives, Determined after follow up procedure to confirm no recurrence, 6 months|Need for more than one endoscopic therapy, Determined after follow up procedures, 3 years|Need for surgery, Determined after follow up procedures, histological review, 2 months|Post ESD, EFTR, STER defect features, Determined after complete resection, 1 day|Patient interviews/questionnaires, Determined after follow up procedures, 3 years
To collect prospective observational data on patients undergoing ESD, EFTR or STER for UGI neoplastic lesions
