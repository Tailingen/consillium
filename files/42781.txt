Regional Anesthesia for Breast Surgery
Patients scheduled for mastecotmy will be randomized to receive either an ultrasound-guided double space paravertebral block or a PECSII + parasternal block. In both groups, blocks will be performed with 20 ml of ropivacaine 0.75%, plus ropivacaine 0.375% 10 ml for parasternal block only.

Postoperative, all patients will receive a morphine PCA. They will follow at 6, 12, 24 months for persistent postoperative surgical pain (PPSP) and cancer recurrence.

Patients scheduled for mastecotmy with or without axillary dissection, will be randomized to receive preoperative either an ultrasound-guided double space paravertebral block or a PECSII + parasternal block. In both groups, blocks will be performed with 20 ml of ropivacaine 0.75%, plus ropivacaine 0.375% 10 ml for parasternal block only.

All the patients also received a general anesthesia induced by propofol and esmeron for endotracheal intubation and desflurane for maintaining.

Sensory block by ice and pinprick test application and maximum spread after 40' from LA injection will be registered.

Postoperative, all patients will receive a morphine PCA, ketorolac 30 mg/12h and paracetamol 1g each 8h.

Morphine consumption will be registered. Patients will follow at 6, 12, 24 months for persistent postoperative surgical pain (PPSP) and cancer recurrence.
