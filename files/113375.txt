Phase II Trial of the Gamma-Secretase Inhibitor PF-03084014 in Adults With Desmoid Tumors/Aggressive Fibromatosis
Background:

* Desmoid tumors (also known as aggressive fibromatosis), are rare, locally invasive, slow-growing soft-tissue tumors. The disease can be either asymptomatic or be associated with severe loss of organ function and significant morbidity.
* Treatment with the selective small-molecule Gamma-secretase inhibitor PF-03084014 caused significant tumor shrinkage in patients with unresectable desmoid tumors in an early phase clinical trial.
* The Notch pathway is a key regulator of cell differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis; aberrant signaling via the Notch pathway is associated with carcinogenesis.

Objectives:

* Primary: Determine the response rate (Complete Response (CR)+Partial Response (PR)) of PF-03084014 in patients with desmoid tumors/aggressive fibromatosis
* Secondary: Assess symptom measures at baseline and on study; perform genotyping for germline and somatic mutations in adenomatous polyposis coli gene (APC) and catenin-beta 1 (CTNNB1) genes; correlate clinical response to therapy with genotyping data; and assess modulation of the Notch pathway by evaluating notch response genes in tumor biopsies at baseline and after drug administration

Eligibility:

* Age greater than or equal to18; histologically confirmed desmoid tumor not amenable to curative resection or definitive radiation therapy that has progressed after receiving at least one line of standard treatment; adequate organ function
* Willingness to provide blood samples and 10 unstained slides or a tumor block for genetic research studies

Study Design:

* This is an open-label Phase II trial of PF-03084014; study drug will be administered orally at 150 mg twice a day in 21-day cycles
* Optional tumor biopsies for research purposes will be performed at baseline prior to study treatment and at the beginning of cycle 7 (+/- one cycle)
* Restaging scans (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with diffusion weighting) will be performed at baseline, at the end of cycles 1 and 6, and then every 6 cycles
* Health-related quality of life (HRQOL)/symptom questionnaires will be administered at baseline and at each Clinical Center visit
Desmoid Tumors|Aggressive Fibromatosis
DRUG: PF-03084014
Number of Participants With a Complete Response (CR) + Partial Response (PR), Complete Response + Partial Response was determined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Complete Response is disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. Partial Response is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Progressive Disease (PD) is at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). The sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions. Stable Disease (SD) is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study., 20 months
Number of Participants With Serious and Non-serious Adverse Events, Here is the count of participants with serious and non-serious adverse events assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria in Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.0). A non-serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence. A serious adverse event is an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that results in death, a life threatening adverse drug experience, hospitalization, disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, congenital anomaly/birth defect or important medical events that jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the previous outcomes mentioned., Date treatment consent signed to date off study, approximately 66 months and 27 days.|Number of Participants With Somatic or Germline Mutations Identified in Adenomatous Polyposis Coli Gene (APC) or Catenin Beta-1 (CTNNB1) Genes, Tumor and blood samples were obtained from participants and genotyped for somatic and germline mutations., Baseline|Mean MD Anderson Symptom Inventory Scores After Treatment, The MD Anderson Symptoms Inventory (MDSAI) questionnaire includes questions regarding 13 symptoms commonly experienced by patients with cancer and 6 additional items that assess the extent to which these symptoms interfered with how patients felt and were able to function. The 0-10 scale (0=none, 1-4=mild, 5-6=moderate, and 7-10=severe) assesses how patients felt and were able to function over the previous 24 hours. A component score representing symptom severity is obtained by taking the average of the 13 symptom items (e.g., pain, fatigue, etc.) together. A component score representing symptom distress is obtaining by averaging the 6 symptom interference items (e.g., general activity, mood, etc.)., At baseline prior to drug administration and at least every 6 cycles of drug (18 weeks) up to 20 months of treatment.
