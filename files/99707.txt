Study of Durvalumab Given With Chemotherapy, Durvalumab in Combination With Tremelimumab Given With Chemotherapy, or Chemotherapy in Patients With Unresectable Urothelial Cancer
This is a randomized, open-label, controlled, multi-center, global Phase III study to determine the efficacy and safety of combining durvalumab ± tremelimumab with standard of care (SoC) chemotherapy (cisplatin + gemcitabine or carboplatin + gemcitabine doublet) followed by durvalumab monotherapy versus SoC alone as first-line chemotherapy in patients with histologically or cytologically documented, unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium (including renal pelvis, ureters, urinary bladder, and urethra).
Unresectable Locally Advanced Urothelial Cancer|Metastatic Urothelial Cancer
DRUG: Durvalumab|DRUG: Tremelimumab|DRUG: Cisplatin + Gemcitabine|DRUG: Carboplatin + Gemcitabine
Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of randomization until death due to any cause, approximately 5 years
Overall Survival (OS), Additional analysis beyond the primary endpoint, approximately 5 years|Overall Survival at 24 months (OS24), The OS24 will be defined as the Kaplan-Meier estimate of OS at 24 months, 24 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS (per RECIST 1.1) will be defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of first objective disease progression or death, approximately 5 years|Alive and Progression Free Survival at 12 months (APF12), The APF12 will be defined as the Kaplan-Meier estimate of PFS (per RECIST 1.1) at 12 months, 12 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR (per RECIST 1.1) is defined as the number (%) of patients with at least 1 visit response of complete response or partial response and will be based on a subset of all randomized patients, approximately 5 years|Duration of Response (DoR), DoR (per RECIST 1.1) will be defined as the time from the date of first documented response until the first date of documented progression or death in the absence of disease progression, approximately 5 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the proportion of subjects with the best overall response of complete response, partial response or stable disease per RECIST 1.1, approximately 5 years|Time from randomization to second (PFS2), PFS2 will be defined as the time from the date of randomization to the earliest of the progression events subsequent to that used for the PFS endpoint or death, approximately 5 years|To assess disease-related symptoms, physical functioning, and other Health-related quality of life, Collection of patient reported outcome questionnaires, approximately 5 years
To assess safety using a summary of adverse events., Adverse Events (both in terms of MedDRA preferred terms and CTCAE grade) will be listed individually by patient. The number of patients experiencing each Adverse Event will be summarized by treatment arm and CTCAE grade, approximately 5 years|To assess pharmacokinetics of Durvalumab and Tremelimumab, Serum concentrations of Durvalumab and Tremelimumab, approximately 5 years|To assess immunogenicity of Durvalumab and Tremelimumab, Presence of anti-drug antibodies for Durvalumab and Tremelimumab, approximately 5 years
