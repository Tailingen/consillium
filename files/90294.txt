Pregnancy Outcomes in Infertile Patients After Treatment With Ulipristal Acetate.
The investigators analyzed a group of infertile women treated with Ulipristal Acetate (UA) for uterine fibroids at the Humanitas Fertility Center. All the patients' data were extracted from the Fertility Center external-audit-anonymized electronic research query system.
Myoma;Uterus|Infertility, Female
implantation rate, number of intrauterine gestational sacs observed divided by the number of transferred embryos, 2013 - 2018
myomas reduction, volumetric reduction in after therapy, 2013 - 2018
In the recent years several large studies have been published on the efficacy of Ulipristal Acetate treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of uterine fibroids in adult women: initially proposed only as pre-surgical treatment, the UA was subsequently also used for the long-term treatment of uterine myomas symptoms.

However, few data are available on the effects of UA in terms of increasing fecundability, implantation and pregnancy outcome and safety in the general population, and in infertile patients in particular.

This retrospective study aims at describing the correlation between the use of Ulipristal Acetate and pregnancy outcome in infertile patients and at comparing the UA plus surgery approach to the UA-only treatment in terms of pregnancy outcome.
