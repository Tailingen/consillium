Gentulizumab in Patients With Advanced Solid Malignancies and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of gentulizumab, an anti-CD47 Monoclonal Antibody, in participants with solid tumors and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
Solid Tumor|Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
DRUG: Gentulizumab
Safety and Tolerability of Gentulizumab as Measured by the Number of Participants Experiencing Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs), Adverse Events (AEs), and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)., The CTCAE criteria will be used to assess adverse events on this trial., 28 days|Pharmacokinetic (PK) Parameter: Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC)., From the first dosing to 90 days after the last dosing|Pharmacokinetic (PK) Parameter: Peak plasma concentration (Cmax)., From the first dosing to 90 days after the last dosing|Pharmacokinetic (PK) Parameter: Terminal phase half-life (t1/2)., From the first dosing to 90 days after the last dosing
Pharmacodynamic (PD) Characteristics of Gentulizumab., PD parameters include: receptor occupancy (RO) of gentulizumab of red blood cells, and white blood cells in peripheral blood., From the first dosing to 90 days after the last dosing|Immunogenicity of Gentulizumab., Numbers of anti-drug antibody (ADA) and/or neutralizing antibody (NAb) positive participants will be used to assess the immunogenicity of gentulizumab., From the first dosing to 28 days after the last dosing
Objective Response Rate (ORR) of Gentulizumab as Monotherapy., ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who had complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST v1.1 by investigator determination., From date of first dosing until the date of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 12 months.|Progression-free Survival (PFS) of Gentulizumab as Monotherapy., PFS was defined as the time ranging from the beginning of enrollment to the tumor progression for the first time or death., From date of first dosing until the date of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 12 months.|Exploratory indicators related to biomarkers, 12 months
This is a first-in-human, escalating dose trial of an antibody that inhibits an anti-apoptotic signal in human macrophages. The major aims of the study are to define the safety profile of this new drug, and to determine a recommended dose and schedule for potential additional trials.
