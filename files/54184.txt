Long-term Follow-up in Patients Included in the European Sleep Apnea Data Base (ESADA)
The European database ESADA, containing data from more than 30,000 patients with very different severities of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome, prospectively collects data from patients referred to academic sleep laboratories in many European countries (https://esada.med.gu.se/). Since 2007, Grenoble is one of the two French centers with Paris and is a very active participant in this European database for patient inclusion and data exploitation.

The first objective of the "ESADA Follow-up and outcomes" project is to collect cardiovascular events during the follow-up of patients in the European database through telephone interviews and a structured questionnaire. Other objectives are to collect metabolic events, incident cancers and deaths in the same population using the same mean.

An additional objective is to assess the impact of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP, the reference treatment for OSA) on the occurrence of cardiovascular and metabolic events and incident cancers, as this is still discussed in the literature.

The European database ESADA prospectively collects data from patients referred to academic sleep laboratories in many European countries (https://esada.med.gu.se/). Since 2007, Grenoble is one of the two French centers with Paris and is a very active participant in this European database for patient inclusion and data exploitation. A partnership agreement exists between University Hospital Grenoble (CHUGA) and ESADA for the reuse of CHUGA data. The data collected at CHUGA as part of the ESADA-Follow-up and outcomes questionnaire are also collected in the other European centers and will be centralized at the level of the coordinating center.

ESADA currently contains data from more than 30,000 patients with very different severities of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome. One of the main limitations of this cohort is the relatively limited amount of information concerning the long-term follow-up of the patients included in the registry.

The first objective of the "ESADA Follow-up and outcomes" project is to collect cardiovascular events during the follow-up of patients in the European database through telephone interviews and a structured questionnaire. Other objectives are to collect metabolic events, incident cancers and deaths in the same population using the same mean.

An additional objective at the end of this data collection is to aggregate the follow-up data of more than 10,000 patients from all participating European centers to assess the impact of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP, the reference treatment for OSA) on the occurrence of cardiovascular and metabolic events and incident cancers, as this is still discussed in the literature.
