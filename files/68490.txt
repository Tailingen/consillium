PORTAL: Patient-reported Outcomes After Routine Treatment of Atypical Lesions
This research study is evaluating how patients feel physically and emotionally after a prior breast biopsy for specific breast conditions (including atypical lesions such as atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH), lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS), and/or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS))
Breast Cancer
OTHER: Survey
The Primary Outcome Measures Severity of Chronic Pain., The Breast Cancer Pain Questionnaire (BCPQ) is a validated, self-reported instrument assessing pain severity, pain frequency (how many days per week), and pain location (breast, arm, side, axilla) over the last 2-week period with an average of 45.8 months from treatment for the two groups, Guideline Concordant Care (GCC) and Active Surveillance (AS). The Pain Burden Index (PBI) is a composite of pain severity, pain frequency, and pain location. Each severity answer is multiplied by each frequency answer and then summed with a total possible score ranging from 0-200 with higher scores indicating worse pain., Patient reported outcome was scheduled from at least one year from diagnosis. Participants' time from diagnosis to completing a survey was an average of 45.8 months in this study cohort.
The goal of this research is to better understand the experience of women who have been diagnosed with certain breast conditions to enable women (and their doctors) to make informed decisions about their care.
