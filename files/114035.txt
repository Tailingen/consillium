The aim of this exploratory study is to assess the performance and tolerability of the MOBIDERM Intimate Bra in the management of breast edema related to breast cancer treatment.
Breast Cancer Surgery
DEVICE: Mobiderm Intimate Bra group
Evolution of breast edema severity, The evolution of breast edema severity will be assessed all along the study follow-up using the patient-completed "Symptoms" section of the Breast Edema Questionnaire (BrEQ): 8 questions about symptoms of breast edema scored on a scale from 0 to 10 (0 = no difficulty and 10: maximal difficulty). The maximum score is 80 ., Between 35 and 44 weeks (6 months after radiotherapy)
Comparison of methods to follow changes in the severity of breast edema - TDC measurement, Measurement of the Tissue Dielectric Constant (TDC) of the breast tissue will be done using the MoistureMeter D (Delfin Technologies Ltd, Finland)., Between 35 and 44 weeks (from inclusion to 6 months after radiotherapy)|Comparison of methods to follow changes in the severity of breast edema - Clinical assessment, Clinical assessment will be done by observation and palpation of the breast by the medical team to monitor changes in the severity of breast edema., Between 35 and 44 weeks (from inclusion to 6 months after radiotherapy)|Comparison of methods to follow changes in the severity of breast edema - Ultrasound measurement, High-frequency cutaneous ultrasound measurements will be done by the medical team to monitor changes in the severity of breast edema (echogenicity, skin thickness)., Between 35 and 44 weeks (from inclusion to 6 months after radiotherapy)|Time to edema onset, The time between surgery and/or radiotherapy and the diagnosis of breast edema will be assessed by analysing the responses to the "Symptoms" section of the BrEQ questionnaire completed weekly., Between 35 and 44 weeks (from inclusion to 6 months after radiotherapy)|Time to edema disappearance, The time to disappearance of the breast edema will be assessed by analysing the responses to the "Symptoms" section of the BrEQ questionnaire completed weekly., Between 35 and 44 weeks (from inclusion to 6 months after radiotherapy)|Symptoms and quality of life changes associated with breast edema, Changes in symptoms (pain, heaviness, swelling, tension, hardness and redness of the skin, etc.) and quality of life related to breast edema will be assessed by the patient by filling in the BrEQ self-questionnaire. The 8 questions related to symptoms and 16 questions related to quality of life are scored on a scale from 0 to 10 (0 = no difficulty and 10: maximal difficulty). The maximum score is 80 for the symptoms part and 160 for the Quality of life part., Between 35 and 44 weeks (from inclusion to 6 months after radiotherapy)|Breast edema hypersensitivity, The evolution of breast hypersensitivity will be assessed using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) (score from 0 to 10 with 0 = no hypersensibility and 10 = maximum hypersensibility)., Between 35 and 44 weeks (from inclusion to 6 months after radiotherapy)|Breast pain, The presence of breast pain will be assessed using a VAS (score from 0 to 10 with 0 = no pain and 10 = Maximal pain)., Between 35 and 44 weeks (from inclusion to 6 months after radiotherapy)|Skin changes associated with breast edema, Changes in skin fibrosis/hardness will be assessed using the SkinFibroMeter (Delfin Technologies Ltd, Finland)., Between 35 and 44 weeks (from inclusion to 6 months after radiotherapy)|Physical activity, The time taken to resume physical activity will be measured by means of a specific question to the patient., Between 35 and 44 weeks (from inclusion to 6 months after radiotherapy)|Healing time, The healing time will be calculated following observation of scar oozing by the medical team., Between 35 and 44 weeks (from inclusion to 6 months after radiotherapy)|Safety of the device, The safety of the device will be assessed by describing the adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) that occur throughout the study., Between 35 and 44 weeks (from inclusion to 6 months after radiotherapy)|Compliance to the device, The Investigator will report compliance with the device at each visit using the patient's diary, which the patient shall complete throughout the follow-up period, Between 35 and 44 weeks (from inclusion to 6 months after radiotherapy)|Patient's satisfaction, Patient's satisfaction with the MOBIDERM Intimate Bra device will be evaluated with a specific self-questionnaire given to the patient., 3 weeks after surgery and 6 months after radiotherapy (end of study)
Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women in the Western World. BCS followed by radiotherapy is a safe and effective procedure to treat patients with early-stage \[Verbelen H., 2021\]. But some patients are troubled by breast edema in the operated and irradiated breast. The consequences of breast edema can be : an increase in breast volume, orange peel skin, heaviness of the breast, redness of the skin, breast pain, thickening of the skin, hyperpigmented skin pores \[Verbelen H., 2014\]. Breast edema can also imply deterioration in patients' quality of life, physical functioning, and body image \[Young-Afat D. A., 2019\].

According to the literature, only a few clinical studies evaluated the value of compression medical devices in the management of breast edema.

The aim of the study is to perform a prospective, exploratory, monocentric, uncontrolled clinical study to look at the performance and safety of Mobiderm Intimate Bra in the management of breast edema related to breast cancer treatment.
