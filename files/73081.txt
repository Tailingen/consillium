The Influence of Perioperative Administration of Dexmedetomidine on Inflammation Response and Postoperative Recovery in Patients Undergoing Robot or Laparoscopic Assisted Gastrectomy
Many studies have shown that inflammation has an important effect on the development, progression, and also response to treatment of tumors. Dexmedetomidine is a potent and selective alpha 2 receptor agonist, known to have a sedative, analgesic and immune-controlling effect. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of dexmedetomidine during surgery on postoperative inflammatory response and surgical recovery in gastric cancer patients undergoing robot or laparoscopic gastrectomy.
