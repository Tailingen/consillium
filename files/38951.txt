the Safety and Efficacy of SENL103 Autologous T Cell Injection
To observe the safety and efficacy of SENL103 cells in the treatment of patients with recurrent or refractory plasma cell blood tumors.
Multiple Myeloma
BIOLOGICAL: SENL103
To observe the number and incidence of adverse events after intravenous infusion of SENL103., The number, incidence and severity of all recorded adverse reactions, including cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity., within 1 months after SENL103 infusion.
Efficacy indicators, To observe the efficacy of cell reperfusion, strict complete response (sCR), complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), partial response (PR), minimal response (MR), disease stabilization (SD), disease-free progression-free survival (PFS rate), survival (OS) were adopted., within 3 months after SENL103 infusion.|PD index, the proportion of BCMA+ plasma cells in peripheral blood, the concentration of free BCMA and the release of cytokines at each time point;, within 3 months after SENL103 infusion.|PK index, the highest concentration of SENL103 cells amplified in peripheral blood (Cmax, measured by flow cytometry and qPCR), the time to reach the highest concentration (Tmax) and the duration of cell survival in the patient;, within 3 months after SENL103 infusion.
Primary endpoint To observe the number and incidence of adverse events after intravenous infusion of SENL103. To evaluate possible adverse reactions recorded within 1 month after SENL103 infusion, including the number, incidence and severity of symptoms such as cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxic reactions; Secondary endpoints

1. Efficacy indicators: The efficacy after cell retransfusion was observed by strict complete response (sCR), complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), partial response (PR), minimal response (MR), stable disease (SD), and progression-free survival (PFS rate);
2. PK index: the highest concentration of SENL103 cells amplified in peripheral blood (Cmax, measured by flow cytometry and qPCR), the time to reach the highest concentration (Tmax) and the duration of cell survival in the patient;
3. PD index: proportion of peripheral blood plasma cells, concentration of free BCMA and cytokine release at each time point;
4. Quality of life assessment: the changes of subjects' quality of life before and after treatment were observed.
