Liver Transplantation for Non-Resectable Colorectal Liver Metastasis
The study aims to evaluate the efficacy of liver transplantation in the context of non-resectable colorectal liver metastasis. The primary endpoint is the overall survival in this group of patients while the secondary endpoint is the disease-free survival.

Patients included in this protocol will be evaluated either for whole or partial liver transplantation from deceased or living donors.

Type of different transplantations proposed are as follows:

1. Whole liver graft or partial liver (split) from a deceased donor
2. Partial liver graft retrieved from a deceased donor and orthotopically implanted after having performed a left hepatectomy in the recipient.
3. Partial liver graft retrieved from a deceased donor and heterotopically implanted if total hepatectomy can not be performed.
4. Partial liver graft retrieved from a living donor and orthotopically implanted after having performed total hepatectomy.
5. Partial liver graft retrieved from a living donor and orthotopically implanted after having after having performed a left hepatectomy in the recipient.
6. Partial liver graft retrieved from a living donor and heterotopically implanted if total hepatectomy can not be performed.

In cases 2-3-5-6 total hepatectomy of native liver can be secondarily performed after having achieved a proper graft hypertrophy in order to avoid a small for size syndrome
