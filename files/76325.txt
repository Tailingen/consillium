Trial Of Sunitinib In Advanced Non-Clear Cell Type Renal Cell Carcinoma
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of sunitinib in non-clear cell type renal cell carcinoma with the exception of pure sarcomatoid carcinoma and collecting duct carcinoma
Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Sunitinib
Response rate, Tumor response is to be measured every 6 weeks. RECIST v.1.1 will be used to definte target lesion and non-target lesion and classify the response category., up to 12 months
Progression free survival, Form the date of enrollment to the date of the first documented disease progression or death from any cause, which came first., up to 24 months|overall survival, up to 36 months|Safety, Safety will be assessed using CTCAE v.3.0, up to 24 months
There have been no standard treatment in non-clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Retrospective studies showed sunitinib or sorafenib might be active in non-clear cell renal cell carcinoma, especially papillary type and chromophobe type.

This study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of sunitinib in this group of patients.
