Urinary Biomarker Study With Sulindac and Difluoromethylornithine
The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of 2 drugs (sulindac and Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO)) either alone or in combination on biomarkers found in urine.
Focus of Study: Drug Response Biomarkers, Chemoprevention, Neoplasms
DRUG: difluoromethylornithine|DRUG: Sulindac
Measure intra-subject urine N1-monoacetylspermidine and dcSAM variability during the pre-drug phase, Measure initial variability in levels of urinary biomarkers prior to initiation of drug treatment. Three blood draws over the first 14 days will be used to assess baseline variability., Week 1-Week 2|Determine dcSAM content of urine after 14 days of 500mg DFMO daily alone, Measure urinary biomarker dcSAM after 14 days of single agent DFMO. Measure urinary biomarker dcSAM after 14 days of single agent DFMO for treatment arm where DFMO alone is started week 2 (Treatment sequence A)., Week 4|Determine N1-monoacetylspermidine content of urine after 14 days plus 1 day of 150 mg sulindac alone, Measure urinary biomarker dcSAM after 14 days of single agent sulindac. Measure urinary biomarker dcSAM after 14 days of single agent sulindac for treatment arm where sulindac alone is started week 2 (Treatment sequence B)., Week 4|Determine dcSAM and N1-monoacetylspermidine content of urine after 14 days of 150 mg sulindac daily combined with DFMO at 500 mg/day, Week 20|Determine dcSAM content of urine after 14 days of 500mg DFMO daily alone, Measure urinary biomarker dcSAM after 14 days of single agent DFMO for treatment arm where DFMO alone is started week 10 (Treatment sequence B), Week 12|Determine N1-monoacetylspermidine content of urine after 14 days plus 1 day of 150 mg sulindac alone, Measure urinary biomarker dcSAM after 14 days of single agent sulindac. Measure urinary biomarker dcSAM after 14 days of single agent sulindac for treatment arm where sulindac alone is stated week 10 (Treatment sequence A)., Week 12
Determine if 2 weeks is sufficient time for dcSAM levels and N1-monoacetylspermidine content of urine to recover after stopping DFMO and sulindac, Week 22|Determine the length of time it takes for sulindac or DFMO to induce measurable changes in biomarker content of urine, Week 3-Week 25|Explore the effect of dietary intake of polyamine measured using the Arizona Food Frequency Questionnaire, Quantitate dietary polyamine levels over the course of the study and evaluate the effects on biomarkers evaluated in the primary outcome measures., Week 1-25
The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of 2 drugs (sulindac and Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO)) either alone or in combination on biomarkers found in urine.
