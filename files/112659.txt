A Global Study of Volrustomig (MEDI5752) Plus Chemotherapy Versus Pembrolizumab Plus Chemotherapy for Participants With Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.
The purpose of eVOLVE-Lung02 is to test the effectiveness (efficacy) and measure the safety of volrustomig in combination with chemotherapy compared with pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy as 1L treatment in participants with mNSCLC in PD-L1 \< 50%.
Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Volrustomig|DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Pemetrexed
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) (using BICR assessments according to RECIST 1.1), PFS is defined as the time from randomization until radiological progression per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR, or death due to any cause (in the absence of progression), in PD-L1-negative participants., Up to approximately 6 years|Overall Survival (OS), in PD-L1-negative participants., OS is defined as the time from randomization until the date of death due to any cause, in PD-L1-negative participants., Up to approximately 6 years
PFS (using BICR assessments according to RECIST 1.1), PFS is defined as the time from randomization until radiological progression per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR, or death due to any cause (in the absence of progression). The analysis will include all randomized participants., Up to approximately 6 years|OS, OS is defined as the time from randomization until the date of death due to any cause. The analysis will include all randomized participants., Up to approximately 6 years|PFS (using Investigator assessments according to RECIST 1.1), PFS is defined as the time from randomization until radiological progression per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by investigator, or death due to any cause (in the absence of progression)., Up to approximately 6 years|Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of participants who have a confirmed CR or confirmed PR, as determined by BICR assessments using RECIST 1.1., Up to approximately 6 years|Duration of Response (DoR), DoR is defined as the time from the date of first documented response until the date of documented progression per BICR assessments using RECIST 1.1 or death due to any cause (in the absence of progression). These analyses will include participants who have a confirmed response., Up to approximately 6 years|PFS2, PFS2 is defined as the time from randomization until the earliest of the progression event (following the initial investigator-assessed progression) after the start of the first subsequent therapy, or death. The date of second progression will be recorded by the investigator in the eCRF and defined according to local standard clinical practice., Up to approximately 6 years|Concentration of volrustomig in serum and PK parameters, To assess the PK of volrustomig, Up to approximately 6 years|Presence of ADAs against volrustomig in serum, To investigate the immunogenicity of volrustomig., Up to approximately 6 years|Time-To-Deterioration (TTD) in physical functioning, To assess participant-reported physical functioning in participants treated with volrustomig plus chemotherapy and pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy., Up to approximately 6 years|TTD of lung cancer symptoms, To assess participant-reported pulmonary symptoms of mNSCLC in participants treated with volrustomig plus chemotherapy and pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy., Up to approximately 6 years
Adult patients with a histologically or cytologically documented metastatic NSCLC, with tumors that lack activating EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 alterations are eligible for enrollment. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive treatment with volrustomig + chemotherapy or pembrolizumab + chemotherapy. Tumor evaluation scans will be performed until disease progression as efficacy assessment. All patients will be followed for survival until the end of the study. An data monitoring committee (DMC) composed of independent experts will be convened to confirm the safety and tolerability of the proposed dose and schedule.
