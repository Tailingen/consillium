Efficacy and Safety of Tenalisib (RP6530), in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer
Phase II, randomized, open-label study, designed to evaluate the preliminary efficacy and safety of tenalisib at two dose levels in 40 patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.
Locally Advanced Breast Cancer|Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Tenalisib 800mg|DRUG: Tenalisib 1200mg
Percentage of Patients Without Disease Progression, Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., Approximately 6 months
Overall Response Rate (ORR), Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., Approximately 18 months|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), It is defined as sum of CR, PR and SD rates, Approximately 18 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS)., PFS is measured from the time of first dose of study drug to radiographic documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause., Approximately 18 months|Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event (AE) can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product, whether or not related to the investigational product., Approximately 18 months
The study will have two groups, Group 1 with a treatment option of 800mg RP6530 BID and Group 2 with a treatment option of 1200mg RP6530 BID, where the subjects will be randomly assigned to each group in 1:1 and continued on each group of treatment till disease progressed.
