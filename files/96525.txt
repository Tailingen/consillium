Proton Radiation for Stage II/III Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to look at the rates of acute and long term adverse events of postoperative proton radiotherapy for complex loco-regional irradiation in women with loco-regionally advanced breast cancer. This study specifically includes longitudinal follow up to assess the incidence of cardiac mortality and second malignant neoplasms at 10 and 15 years following proton therapy(PT).

The proposed Phase II study is seeking to build clinical data as a continuation of the original dosimetric analysis published by Ares et al. performed at Paul-Scherrer Institute (PSI). That comparison demonstrated a benefit form proton planning for patients with non-metastatic breast cancer requiring complex, loco-regional, postoperative radiotherapy.1 The advantages of PT were improved target coverage compared to standard photon irradiation and reduced dose to heart, lungs and contralateral breast.

The study goal is to demonstrate a "meaningful benefit" of proton therapy for women with loco-regionally advanced breast cancer. The main clinical endpoints of this trial are the reduction of cardiac morbidity and mortality (coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, cardiac insufficiency) and the reduction of contralateral, second breast cancer. Both adverse events are presently associated with external beam photon therapy. Both goals require longitudinal follow-up of minimum 5-10 years. Despite the logistical challenges of long term follow-up, the effort is needed in view of the compelling preclinical evidence of dose avoidance or even absence of radiation dose to heart and contralateral breast uniquely accomplishable by protons only.
