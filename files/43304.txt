Docetaxel and Irinotecan in Gastric Cancer
To assess the role of docetaxel and irinotecan combination in second line gastric cancer. The primary end point is response rate. Secondary end points are toxicity, PFS and OS.
Stomach Cancer|Gastric Cancer|Chemotherapy Effect
DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Irinotecan
Overall response rate (ORR), described according to RECIST criteria, 6 months from chemotherapy
Quality of life (QoL), A questionnaire with the QLQ-C30 form will be conducted at enrollment, after 3 months and after end of treatment.

A score between 1 to 4 will be used in the questionnaire where higher score means worse quality of life., three months and six months from chemotherapy|Progression free survival (PFS), The time interval between starting the test protocol and the next disease progression or death whichever earlier, One year from start of enrollment|Overall survival (OS), The time interval between diagnosis and death, One year from start of enrollment
Gastric cancer is a major killer in oncology. The expected overall survival of metastatic patients is less than 2 years. Moreover, most of the patients develop cachexia and worsening of performance over time. As a result, many patients are not fit for second line treatment when eligible. There is currently no approved consensus for third line treatment regimen and in most of the patients it is usually best supportive care.

Irinotecan and docetaxel were tested as single agents or in combination with other drugs (e.g. FOLFIRI) in second line setting. However, the combination of these two drugs together was not tested before. Both agents are active in second line setting which is considered the last chance of the patient in view of lack of evidence in third line setting.
