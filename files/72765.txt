Safety and Efficacy of Sequential CD19 and CD22 Targeted CAR-T Therapy for Relapsed/Refractory B Cell Lymphoma
This is a single arm study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Sequential CD19 and CD22 targeted CAR-T cells therapy for patients with relapsed/refractory B Cell Lymphoma.
Lymphoma, B-Cell

Although the CD19 targeted CAR-T cell therapies have gained significant results in patients with relapsed and refractory B-cell Leukemia and Lymphoma. There are some patients who resisted anti-CD19 CAR-T cells or get CD19 negative relapse. To make further improvement, We launch such a clinical trial using sequential CD19 and CD22 targeted CAR-T cells for patients with relapsed and refractory B Cell Lymphoma to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sequential CD19 and CD22 targeted CAR-T cell therapy.
