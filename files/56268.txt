PREDATOR: Neoadjuvant Gene Prediction for Breast Cancer
Study of the assay, Mammostrat®. to verify its utility as a predictor or outcome tool to determine whom would benefit from chemotherapy prior to surgery. Also could be used as a clinical marker to identify patients with breast cancer who do not benefit from some preoperative chemotherapies.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Anthracycline based chemotherapy|DRUG: taxane-based chemotherapy
Compare Mammostrat score clinical response rates to chemotherapy, The percentage of patients undergoing chemotherapy who have Mammostrat low risk scores will be calculated, 2 years
pathological complete response rate compare to predictors, The percentage of patients undergoing chemotherapy who have Mammostrat low risk scores will be calculated, 2 years
The purpose of this phase II study is to find out if the test, Mammostrat® can be used as a predictor or outcome tool to determine who will best benefit from chemotherapy prior to surgery. This can be used to determine if Mammostrat assay may be used as a clinical marker to identify a subset of women with breast cancer who do not benefit from preoperative chemotherapy, either taxane/taxane-like (T) chemo agents or anthracycline-based chemotherapy and cyclophosphamide (AC).
