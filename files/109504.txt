Efficacy and Safety of TKI Combined With Chemotherapy and Sequential CAR-T Cells in ND Adult Patients With Ph+ ALL
In recent years, immunotherapy (eg. blinatumomab, inotuzumab ozogamicin, CAR-T cells) has demonstrated a high safety and efficacy profile in relapsed/refractory (R/R）B-ALL. The available data suggest that the advancement of immunotherapy from R/R field to the frontline setting may be an important approach to increase the depth of remission, which ultimately translates into a survival benefit. In this study, the investigators propose a treatment regimen using CAR-T cell therapy as a consolidation method for Ph+ ALL patients achieving complete remission (CR) with overembatinib, venetoclax and reduced-intensity chemotherapy, aiming to reduce the total cycles of chemotherapy and related toxicities, shorten length of hospitalization, and ultimately improve patients' survival and quality of life.

The CAR-T cells were murine-derived second-generation CD19 CAR-T with a co-stimulation domain of 4-1BB, and the infusion dose was 1×10\^6/kg CAR+ cells in a single infusion.
