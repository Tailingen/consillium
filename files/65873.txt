Poly-ICLC (Hiltonol) and Anti-PD1 or Anti-PD-L1
This is an open labeled, non-randomized adaptive pilot study. The study interventions involved in this study are:

Poly-ICLC (Polyinosinic-Polycytidylic acid stabilized with polylysine and carboxymethylcellulose, also known as Hiltonol®) treatment in combination with anti-PD-1 (Nivolumab, Cemiplimab or Pembrolizumab) or anti-PD-L1 (Atezolizumab or Durvalumab)
Solid Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Poly-ICLC combination treatment with aPD-1 (Nivolumab or Pembrolizumab) or aPD-L1 (Atezolizumab or Durvalumab) over 6 months
Tumor assessment, Response and progression will be evaluated in this study. Tumor Response will be assessed by the RECIST 1.1 Criteria. Response is defined as CR, PR or SD over a period of at least 4 weeks. Changes in the sum of the two largest perpendicular diameters (SPD) of the tumor lesions, or the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST 1.1 criteria. Study subjects with progressive disease will be evaluated to determine whether the progression causes symptoms and/or functional decline and study subjects with non-clinically relevant progression of disease may remain on study at the investigator's discretion., 6 month timepoint compared to baseline
This research study is a PhaseI/II clinical trial investing a combination of targeted therapies as possible treatment for advanced solid cancers

FDA has not yet approved Poly-ICLC as treatment for diseases in this study

Pembrolizumab, Nivolumab, Atezolizumab, Cemiplimab and Durvalumab are now FDA approved for certain patients with multiple cancer types.

The study is designed to evaluate the safety of intramuscular (IM) Polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid stabilized with polylysine and carboxymethylcellulose (Poly-ICLC, Hiltonol®) in combination with Anti-PD-1 or Anti-PD-L1 for treatment of study subjects with advanced solid cancers.
