Daratumumab for the Treatment of Patients With AL Amyloidosis
Participants with AL Amyloidosis will receive the drug daratumumab by IV infusion once weekly for two months, then every 2 weeks for four months, then once each month. Study treatment may continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or decision to withdraw from the trial. Disease evaluations will be performed every three months until disease progression.
AL Amyloidosis
DRUG: daratumumab
Assess the Number of Patients Who Respond to Treatment, Number of participants with response and ability to tolerate study treatment in each of these categories: Complete Response (CR), Very Good Partial Response (VGPR), Partial Response (PR), Stable Disease (SD), and Progressive Disease (PD).

All participants were able to tolerate study treatment.

Per protocol, overall response designations are a combination of hematologic response.

A CR is defined as negative serum and urine immunofixation electrophoresis with normal serum free light chain ratio; a VGPR is reduction in the dFLC\* to \<40 mg/L, a PR is dFLC reduction by \>50%; SD is not meeting criteria for CR, VGPR, PR, or PD; and PD is an increase in FLC of 50% to \>100 mg/L.

\* "dFLC" is difference in involved and uninvolved serum Free Light-Chain levels., 3 months
Time to Next Treatment, Number of months from study drug initiation to starting another treatment, Up to 3 years|Assess Hematologic Response Based on Blood and Urine Testing Using Standard Criteria, Number of patients with hematologic complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), or partial response (PR).

Per protocol, a hematologic CR is defined as negative serum and urine immunofixation electrophoresis with normal serum free light chain ratio; a VGPR is reduction in the dFLC\* to \<40 mg/L; and a PR is dFLC reduction by \>50%.

\* "dFLC" is difference in involved and uninvolved serum free light-chain levels, 3 months|Assess Organ Responses Based on Standard Criteria Included in Protocol, Number of patients with organ response based on standard criteria included in protocol.

Cardiac response is defined as: NT-proBNP response (\>30% and \>300 ng/L decrease in patients with a baseline NT-proBNP \>650 ng/L; and/or NYHA class response (\> two-class decrease if baseline NYHA class 3 or 4)

Renal response is defined as: Decrease in proteinuria by \> 30% or below 0.5 g/24 h without renal progression. Serum creatinine and creatinine clearance must not worsen by 25% over baseline, 3 months
This Phase I/II study is intended to evaluate the safety and tolerability of infusion of daratumumab in AL amyloidosis, specifically with respect to infusion reactions. In addition, the investigators would like to assess organ response with respect to cardiac biomarkers and proteinuria, as well as hematologic response and time to next treatment. Participants with AL Amyloidosis will receive the drug daratumumab by IV infusion once weekly for two months, then every 2 weeks for four months, then once each month. Study treatment may continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or decision to withdraw from the trial. Disease evaluations will be performed every three months until disease progression.
