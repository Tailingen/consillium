Intravaginal Artesunate for the Treatment of HPV+ High Grade Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN2/3)
This phase I research protocol is designed to assess immunogenicity and clinical endpoints in patients with human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)2/3. The protocol tests the use of artesunate in suppository formulation applied intravaginally in patients with cervical dysplasia (CIN2/3).

The primary endpoint is to determine and evaluate the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of intravaginal administration of artesunate in health women with CIN2/3.
Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia Grade 2/3|High-risk HPV (Any Strain)
DRUG: Artesunate Suppositories
Number of Participants With Serious Adverse Events, Number of participants with serious adverse events or dose limiting toxicities related to the study intervention assessed using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 4.0 criteria., 41 weeks
Viral Clearance of HPV, Number of participants whose human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes present at study entry become undetectable without surgical intervention. HPV genotyping detects strains of HPV present at each timepoint. For this outcome, we evaluated whether strains of HPV detected at study entry became undetectable during the study participation., 41 weeks|Histologic Regression of CIN2/3, Number of participants who had histologic regression from cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2/3 to CIN 1 or less, as assessed by colposcopically-directed biopsies. Histologic regression is defined as disappearance of the high grade lesion (CIN2/3) without surgical intervention., 41 weeks
Phase I open-label dose escalation study of intravaginal artesunate, formulated in suppositories, in adult females with biopsy-confirmed CIN2/3. Thirty (30) subjects will undergo up to a total of three cycles of intravaginal artesunate. The first cycle will be initiated on Day 0, the second at Week 4, and the third and final cycle at week 8.
