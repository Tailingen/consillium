Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of Darolutamide and Stereotactic Dose Escalated Radiotherapy in Patients With Localized Prostate Cancer and High-risk Features of Relapse
PEACE 7 is an international, multicenter, randomized, open-label phase III study that aims at evaluating the efficacy and safety of darolutamide and of stereotactic dose escalated prostate radiotherapy in patients with localised prostate cancer and high-risk features of relapse (defined as patients with at least 2 high-risk criteria from National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) classification) using a factorial (2x2) design.

The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of darolutamide and of a stereotactic dose escalated radiotherapy targeting prostate in combination with ADT and pelvic nodal radiotherapy in terms of metastasis-free survival (MSF).

Patients will be randomized (1:1:1:1) to receive either:

* Arm A (Standard arm): ADT + conventional fractionated or moderately hypo-fractionated prostate radiotherapy including pelvic nodal radiotherapy
* Arm B (Experimental arm): ADT + conventional fractionated or moderately hypo-fractionated prostate radiotherapy including pelvic nodal radiotherapy + darolutamide
* Arm C (Experimental arm): ADT + conventional fractionated or moderately hypo-fractionated pelvic nodal radiotherapy + Prostate SBRT
* Arm D (Experimental arm): ADT + conventional fractionated or moderately hypo-fractionated pelvic nodal radiotherapy + Prostate SBRT + darolutamide

Patient will receive systemic treatments (ADT and/or darolutamide) during 2 years where visits on site are planned at D45, D90, D180 and then every 3 months for checkups and follow prostate specific antigen (PSA) level.

Metastasis-free survival (MFS) is defined as the time interval from randomization to the date of the appearance of metastasis (on next generation imaging) or death (from any cause), whichever occurs first. Radiographic evaluation will be carried out at the time of biochemical failure (Phoenix criteria) or in case of clinical suspicion. After biochemical failure (Phoenix criteria) radiographic evaluation on next generation imaging (prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET) scan (any European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved PSMA tracer)) will be performed every 6 months until a metastatic site of relapse is identified and will be repeated at each subsequent PSA progression.

Metastasis-free survival, Metastasis-free survival (MFS) is defined as the time interval from randomization to the date of the appearance of metastasis (on next generation imaging) or death (from any cause), whichever occurs first., from randomization to the onset of metastasis or death, up to 8.5 years
Clinical Progression-Free Survival, Clinical Progression-Free Survival (cPFS) is the length of time during and after the treatment of a disease that a patient lives with the disease but it does not get worse. Clinical disease progression is defined as metastatic relapse or proven local relapse (by either biopsy or unequivocal imaging), unequivocal nodal progression on imaging, or death (from any cause), whichever occurs first., From randomization to disease progression, up to 8.5 years|Biochemical Progression-Free Survival, Biochemical Progression-Free Survival is the length of time during and after the treatment of a disease that a patient lives with the disease but it does not get worse. Biological disease progression is defined as the time interval from randomization to the date of PSA relapse or death (from any cause), whichever occurs first., From randomization to PSA relapse or death, up to 8.5 years|Time to local relapse, Time to local relapse is defined as the time interval from randomization to the date of the appearance of the first proven local relapse (by either biopsy or unequivocal imaging)., From randomization to local disease progression, up to 8.5 years|Prostate Cancer-Specific Survival (PCSS), Prostate Cancer-Specific Survival (PCSS) is defined as the time interval between randomization and the date of death due to prostate cancer., From randomization to death due to prostate cancer, up to 8.5 years|Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS) is the length of time from randomization that patients enrolled in the study are still alive, From randomization to death, up to 20 years
