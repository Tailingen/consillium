A Pharmacokinetic Study Comparing SCT400 And Rituximab in Patients With B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
The primary objective of the study is to assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) similarity of SCT400 versus rituximab (MabThera速) in patients with CD20+ B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate the pharmacodynamics (PD) and safety of SCT400 versus rituximab (MabThera速), as well as the presence of human anti-chimeric antibodies (HACA).
