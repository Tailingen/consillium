The Effects of Programmed Death-ligand 1 on Postoperative Pain for Lung Cancer Patients
The concentration of plasma programmed death-ligand 1(PD-L1) for lung cancer patients before video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery is detected. According to the distribution of plasma concentration, patients are divided into high or low expression of PD-L1. Differences in acute and chronic postoperative pain are compared between two groups of patients. And effects of PD-L1 expresion on postoperative pain in lung cancer patients are explained.

Chronic pain after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) has been a major concern for lung cancer patients. The relationship between plasma programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) concentration and chronic pain in post-VATS is uncertain. This study aims to explore the effects of PD-L1 levels on chronic pain and provide proactive pain management regimen according to individual genetic differences.
