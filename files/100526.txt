A Study of Atezolizumab (Anti-PD-L1 Antibody) in Combination With Enzalutamide in Participants With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostrate Cancer (mCRPC) After Failure of an Androgen Synthesis Inhibitor And Failure of, Ineligibility For, or Refusal of a Taxane Regimen
This Phase III, multicenter, randomized, open-label study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of atezolizumab (anti-programmed death-ligand 1 \[anti-PD-L1\] antibody) in combination with enzalutamide compared with enzalutamide alone in participants with mCRPC after failure of an androgen synthesis inhibitor (e.g., abiraterone) and failure of, ineligibility for, or refusal of a taxane regimen. Participants will be randomized to one of the two treatment arms (atezolizumab in combination with enzalutamide, and enzalutamide alone) in a 1:1 ratio (experimental to control arm) in global randomized phase. Participants will receive treatment until investigator-assessed confirmed radiographic disease progression per Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria or unacceptable toxicity.
