SGI-110 in Combination With Carboplatin in Ovarian Cancer
A 2-part, Phase 2 controlled, open-label, randomized study in participants with platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer. In Part 1, participants received SGI-110 and carboplatin. The optimum dose of SGI-110 (guadecitabine) was identified in Part 1 based on safety and efficacy. In Part 2, participants were randomized to receive the dose identified in Part 1 plus carboplatin or one of four treatment of choice at the discretion of the investigator. The treatment of choice consisted of topotecan, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, paclitaxel or gemcitabine.
Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: SGI-110|DRUG: Treatment of Choice (topotecan, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, paclitaxel, or gemcitabine)|DRUG: Carboplatin
Stage 1: Dose Limiting Toxicities, Number of participants with dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) in Stage 1, Up to 12 months|Stage 2: Progression Free Survival, Progression free survival (PFS) time was defined as the time interval from the date of the first dose of study medication until the earlier of disease progression or death. Participants were treated with their assigned treatment \[guadecitabine+carboplatin (G+C) or treatment choice (TC)\] until disease progression or unacceptable treatment-related toxicity occurred., Up to 24 months
Objective Response Rate, The objective response rate (ORR) was defined as the proportion of participants who experienced an objective response (best overall response of complete response/full response or partial response, which was confirmed by a subsequent assessment at least 28 days later). Response categories were determined based on RECIST v1.1 criteria, or on modified Rustin (CA-125) criteria if response assessment could not be made using RECIST criteria., Up to 24 months|Progression Free Survival at 6 Months, Progression free survival rate at 6 months is the proportion of participants who were alive and did not have disease progression at 6 months after start of treatment., 6 months|Clinical Benefit Rate, Clinical benefit rate (CBR) was defined as the proportion of subjects who experienced a best overall response of complete response/full response or partial response (confirmed by a subsequent assessment at least 28 days later), or documented stable disease for at least 3 months after the first dose. Response categories were determined based on RECIST v1.1 criteria, then based on modified Rustin (CA-125) criteria if assessment could not be made using RECIST criteria., Up to 24 months|CA-125 Levels, Percentage of participants with CA-125 reduction by â‰¥ 50% from baseline, Up to 24 months|Duration of Response, Duration of response is defined as the time between the date of the first documentation of complete response/full response or partial response, and the date of disease progression or date of death due to any cause, or the last adequate tumor assessment prior to the start of subsequent anti-cancer therapy including crossing over to G+C from TC arm, whichever occurred earlier. Only participants who responded were included in the duration of response calculation., Up to 24 months|Overall Survival, Overall survival was defined as the number of days from the day the participant was administered the first dose of study treatment to the date of death (regardless of cause). Survival time was censored on the last date the participant was known to be alive or lost to follow-up before reaching the event of death; in the TC group, time was censored at the date of crossover., Up to 24 months|Stage 1: Pharmacokinetic Parameter Cmax, Time to maximum plasma concentration for guadecitabine, decitabine and carboplatin, Pre-dose and up to 8 hours post-dose on Cycle 1 Day 1 for guadecitabine and decitabine and Day 8 for carboplatin (28 day cycles)|Stage 1: Pharmacokinetic Parameter Tmax, Time to last measurable concentration for guadecitabine, decitabine and carboplatin, Pre-dose and up to 8 hours post-dose on Cycle 1 Day 1 for guadecitabine and decitabine and Day 8 for carboplatin (28 day cycles)|Stage 1: Pharmacokinetic Parameter AUC0-8, Area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 8 hours (AUC0-8) for guadecitabine, decitabine and carboplatin, Pre-dose and up to 8 hours post-dose on Cycle 1 Day 1 for guadecitabine and decitabine and Day 8 for carboplatin (28 day cycles)
