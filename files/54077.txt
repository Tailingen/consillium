Predictive Value of PET/CT for Efficacy of Neoadjuvant Immunotherapy in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
The aim of this study was to investigate the enhancement of FAPI PET/CT metabolic parameters in predicting the efficacy performance of neoadjuvant immunotherapy using the pCR status of surgically resected specimens of lung cancer as the gold standard.
