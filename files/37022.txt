Feasibility Trial Of Image Guided External Beam Radiotherapy With Or Without High Dose Rate Brachytherapy Boost In Men With Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer
This research is being done because investigators involved in this study would like to compare image guided external beam radiation therapy (IGRT) to IGRT plus HDR brachytherapy boost to see which treatment is better and what the side effects of treatment are.
Prostate Cancer
RADIATION: Image guided external beam radiotherapy with or without brachytherapy boost|RADIATION: Brachytherapy
Feasibility of Ability to Accrue Patients, The ability to accrue 60 patients over an 18 month period to a study that randomizes men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer to curative intent treatment with image guided external beam radiotherapy (IGRT) or IGRT with high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy boost within a Canadian multicentre setting., 21 months
Number of Participants Reported Adverse Events, Acute genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events., 21 months|Treatment Compliance, Treatment compliance will be monitored on an ongoing basis by Central Office and the designated radiotherapy quality assurance reviewer and will be described for both arms., 21 months|Radiotherapy Quality Assurance -Timing, The time from the the time from IGRT Real Time Review Signed to IGRT Real Time Review Uploaded., 5 months
Before a big study is done, a smaller study (called a "feasibility study") is required to make sure that patients and physicians are willing to participate in a study comparing the two kinds of treatments, and to verify how the radiation therapy is given in different centres across Canada.

The standard or usual treatment for this disease includes treatment with IGRT or IGRT plus HDR brachytherapy boost.
