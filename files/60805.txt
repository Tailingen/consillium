A Phase I Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and PK of HLX43 in Advanced/Metastatic Solid Tumors
This study is an open-label first-in-human phase I clinical study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of HLX43.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: HLX43
The Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) of HLX43 within 21 days after the first Administration, DLT refers to the AEs that are determined to be related to the investigational product by the investigator, whose severity will affect the escalation of dose level. In this study, the DLT observation period lasts for 21 days after the first administration of HLX43., From first dose to the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 3 weeks)|The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of HLX43, The highest dose level, at which DLT is observed in no more than one of 6 evaluable patients, is defined as MTD of HLX43, From first dose to the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 3 weeks)
Objective response rate (ORR), Percentage of participants with complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) based on investigator assessment., approximately up to 24 months|Duration of response (DOR), Length of time response continued based on investigator's assessment., approximately up to 24 months.|Progression-free survival (PFS), The PFS is defined as the time from the date of enrollment to the date of the first objective documentation of disease progression (as per RECIST v1.1) or death due to any cause,whichever occurred first., approximately up to 24 months|Overall survival (OS), Time from the date of enrollment to the date of death for any cause., approximately up to 24 months|Cmax, Maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of HLX43., Up to 21 days after the first dose|Tmax, Time to maximum serum concentration (Tmax) of HLX43., Up to 21 days after the first dose|T1/2, Half-life (T1/2) of HLX43., Up to 21 days after the first dose|ADA (anti-drug antibody), Incidence and titer of ADA of HLX43., approximately up to 24 months|Nab (neutralizing antibody), Incidence and titer of Nab of HLX43., approximately up to 24 months|Number of subjects experiencing adverse events, Frequency and seriousness of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs)., Day 1 through 90 days after last dose.
This study is an open-label first-in-human phase I clinical study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of HLX43 with escalated doses in the treatment of patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumors.

In the phase Ia of this study, a 3 + 3 dose escalation method will be adopted, and the patients will be administered with HLX43 at different doses via intravenous infusion. The DLT observation period lasts for 3 weeks after the first administration of HLX43.

In phase Ib of this study. The Safety Review Committee will recommend dose groups for expansion based on the safety, efficacy and PK data of the dose escalation phase.
