A Study of Cediranib and Olaparib at the Time Ovarian Cancer Worsens on Olaparib
This is a phase 2 study (the second phase in testing a new drug or drug combination) to see how useful adding investigational drug cediranib to olaparib after disease progression on olaparib alone in patients with ovarian cancer.

Cediranib works by blocking (inhibiting) several specific proteins in cancer cells called the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors. These proteins are important in the formation of blood vessels to the tumor. It is believed that many tumors survive because the blood vessels on the tumors bring oxygen and nutrients to the cancer cells which enable them to grow. If the formation of the blood vessels is blocked, the tumor cells may die.

Olaparib works by blocking protein called poly \[adenosine diphosphate-ribose\] polymerase (PARP). PARP is an important protein which tries to fix damaged deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA, molecules that contain important instructions for the development of cells). Many cancers are though develop from damaged DNA. By blocking PARP from fixing damaged DNA, the tumor cells may die.

Adding cediranib to olaparib, and therefore blocking several different mechanisms for cancer growth, may stop tumor growth.
