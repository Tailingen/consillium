Antibiotic Treatment and Long-term Outcomes of Patients With Pseudomyxoma Peritonei of Appendiceal Origin
The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of antibiotic therapy on the disease progression and overall survival of patients with Pseudomyxoma Peritonei (PMP).
Pseudomyxoma Peritonei|Appendiceal Neoplasms
DRUG: PrevPac (Prevacid, Amoxicillin, Clarithromycin)
Overall survival, Kaplan-Meier survival estimates, 5 year
Progression-free survival measured by no evidence of disease progression, i.e. tumor markers within normal limits, no radiographical evidence of disease, Kaplan-Meier survival estimates, 5 year
Tolerance and safety of PrevPac administration, Rate of morbidity and mortality, Through 14 day treatment therapy|Analyze number of live bacteria in PMP tumor and mucin, In situ hybridization \[ISH\], either bright light or fluorescence in situ hybridization \[FISH\], through study completion, an average of 5 years
Single center, open label, historical controlled, phase II study that proposes two courses of standard H. Pylori eradication antibiotic therapy can suppress carcinogenesis and improve the long-term outcomes of patients with PMP. The first course of antibiotics (PrevPac) will be administered before cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC and the second course afterwards. The historical control group will consist of all PMP patients from Mercy Medical Center's Tumor Registry who did not receive perioperative antibiotic treatment. Long-term statistical outcomes will be calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard ratio to compare pertinent variable. 80 subjects to be enrolled over 2 years, with a 5 year follow-up period.
