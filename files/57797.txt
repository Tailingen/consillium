Clinical Trial of HY004 Cell Injection in the Treatment of Relapsed or Refractory B-Cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
This is a multi-center, open-label, single-arm, phase I/II trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of HY004 treatment in Adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (r/r B-NHL).

This trial is a multi-center, open label, single-arm, phase I/II trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of HY004 in Adult(aged 18\~75 years old) patients with r/r B-NHL.

The phase I part of the trial is to evaluate the safety, optimal dose of HY004, Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics(PK/PD)and preliminary efficacy in the treatment of Adult patients with r/r B-NHL. The phase II part of the trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of HY004 in in the treatment of Adult patients with r/r B-NHL. The study includes screening, pre-treatment (Cell Product manufacture \& lymphodepletion), HY004 infusion , safety and efficacy follow-up, and survival follow-up. All subjects who have received HY004 infusion will be followed for up to 2 years.
