Evaluation of the Immunogenicity of Vaccination With Multiple Synthetic Melanoma Peptides With Granulocyte-macrophage Colony-stimulating Factor (GM-CSF)-In-Adjuvant, in Patients With Advanced Melanoma
This is an open-label, phase II study of a vaccine comprising melanoma peptides and a tetanus helper peptide, administered in GM-CSF-in-adjuvant. Patients will be randomized to receive one of two different vaccine regimens. Patients will be stratified by stage of disease (IIB versus III versus IV).

BIOLOGICAL: 4-peptide and 12-peptide melanoma vaccines
Safety of the 12-peptide mixture and cumulative number of T cells derived from the sentinel immunized node that are reactive to the 12 melanoma peptides included in the vaccine, in the context of HLA-A1, -A2, or -A3., 24 months
Immunogenicity of the individual peptides incorporated into the vaccine, cytotoxic and proliferative responses of T-cells to autologous and allogeneic melanoma cells., Week 4|Disease-free survival of stage IIB and stage III patients, ongoing
Each vaccination will be administered over a 6-week period (days 1, 8, 15, 29, 36, 43). Patients will be randomized into one of two groups, Group A or Group B.

Group A will receive 4 class I MHC-restricted synthetic melanoma peptides (1 each restricted by HLA-A1, -A3, and two restricted by HLA-A2) and a tetanus helper peptide.

Group B will receive the 12 class I MHC-restricted synthetic melanoma peptides (4 each restricted to HLA-A1, -A2, and -A3) and a tetanus helper peptide.

All vaccines will contain GM-CSF-in-adjuvant and will be administered intradermally and subcutaneously. Concurrent with the first three of these vaccinations, each patient will also receive an additional set of 3 identical vaccinations in a distal site, the response to which will be evaluated at the draining lymph node. This node will be harvested using lymphatic mapping and sentinel node biopsy methods and will be referred to as the sentinel immunized node (SIN).
