Molecular Imaging of HER2 Expression in Breast Cancer Using 99mTc-ZHER2.
The study should evaluate distribution of 99mTc-ZHER2:41071 Affibody molecule in patients with primary HER2-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer

The primary objectives are:

1. To assess distribution of 99mTc-ZHER2:41071 in normal tissues and in tumors over time;
2. To evaluate dosimetry of 99mTc-ZHER2:41071;
3. To obtain initial information concerning safety and tolerability of 99mTc-ZHER2:41071 after single intravenous injection:

The secondary objectives are:

1. To compare the tumor imaging data with the data concerning HER2 expression obtained by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and/or fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of biopsy samples.

2. To evaluate dosimetry of 99mTc-ZHER2:41071;
3. To obtain initial information concerning safety and tolerability of 99mTc-ZHER2:41071 after single intravenous injection:

The secondary objectives are:

1. To compare the tumour imaging data with the concerning HER2 expression obtained by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of biopsy samples:

Methodology:

Open-label, exploratory, single center study. The subjects will receive a single injection of the labelled tracer.
