The current study proposes to examine the efficacy of couples-based mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) on positive and negative psychological responses to active surveillance (AS) and AS adherence, with a larger, more geographically representative sample of men on AS and their spouses. We will compare the MBSR intervention condition (Group A) with a health promotion and wellness condition (Group B) in a sample of prostate cancer patients and their spouses. We will evaluate its efficacy on self-reported measures of positive and negative psychological responses to AS.

PRIMARY AIM Examine longitudinal change in positive and negative psychological responses to AS between groups over time.

SECONDARY AIM Observe the relation between positive and negative psychological responses to AS and AS adherence between groups over time.

THIRD AIM Explore dyadic factors on positive and negative psychological responses to AS and AS adherence between groups over time.
