A Study of HY-0102 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a phase 1 open label multicenter study to evaluate the maximum tolerance, safety, tolerance and PK of HY-0102 administered intravenously (IV) once every two weeks in patients with advanced solid tumors, so as to confirm the recommended phase 2 dose of HY-0102 and obtain the preliminary efficacy information of patients with advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumor

ORR (confirmed complete or partial response), The overall response rate (ORR) will be estimated based on the proportion of evaluable patients whose overall response (ORR) during study treatment is CR or PR. Disease response will be assessed by the investigator using RECIST v1.1, FU period/EOS visits every 3 months (± 14 days) after the EOT visit for 12 months|DCR (confirmed response or stable disease lasting for at least 6 months), According to the RECIST v1.1 to assess anti-tumor activity of HY-0102, FU period/EOS visits every 3 months (± 14 days) after the EOT visit for 12 months|Duration of Response (DoR), According to the RECIST v1.1 to assess anti-tumor activity of HY-0102, FU period/EOS visits every 3 months (± 14 days) after the EOT visit for 12 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), According to the RECIST v1.1 to assess anti-tumor activity of HY-0102, FU period/EOS visits every 3 months (± 14 days) after the EOT visit for 6 months|Cmax (Maximum observed serum concentration) of HY-0102, Cmax of HY-0102 is observed directly from data, From first dose through 30days(±7) days after the last dose of study medication|Ctrough (Trough observed serum concentration) of HY-0102, Ctrough of HY-0102 was observed directly from data., From first dose through 30(±7) days after the last dose of study medication|Tmax(Time to maximum plasma concentration), Tmax of HY-0102 was observed directly from data as time of Cmax., From first dose through 30(±7) days after the last dose of study medication|AUC(0-T) [Area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to the last quantifiable concentration] of HY-0102, AUClast of HY-0102 was determined by linear/log trapezoidal method., From first dose through 30(±7) days after the last dose of study medication|AUC(tau) [Area under the concentration-time curve in one dosing interval] of HY-0102, AUCtau of HY-0102 was determined using linear/log trapezoidal method., From first dose through 30(±7) days after the last dose of study medication|AUC(inf) [Area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity and the extrapolated area] of HY-0102, AUCinf = AUClast + (Clast\*/kel), where Clast\* is the estimated concentration at the time of the last measurable concentration and kel is the terminal phase rate constant calculated as the absolute value of the slope of a linear regression during the terminal phase of the natural log-transformed concentration time profile., From first dose through 30(±7) days after the last dose of study medication|T1/2 (Elimination half life) of HY-0102, T1/2 of HY-0102 was observed directly from data., From first dose through 30 days (+/- 7 days) after the last dose of study medication|Anti-drug Antibody (ADA), To assess the immunogenicity of HY-0102, From first dose through 30(±7) days after the last dose of study medication
This is a Phase I trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary antitumor activity of HY-0102 administered intravenously (IV) once every two weeks in adult patients with locally advanced/metastatic malignant solid tumors (urothelial carcinoma, colorectal and pancreatic cancers, etc).

Three dosing cohorts are planned with the doses of 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg. The study will apply a standard 3+3 dose escalation design in dose escalation.Dose expansion will enroll approximately 30-40 cases of tumor types that have demonstrated preliminary efficacy in the early escalation phase.

The number of enrolled patients is estimated to be up to 50. The dose limiting toxicity evaluation period will be the first 28 days (Cycle 1) and subsequent cycles will be 4 weeks in duration. Patients will receive the investigational drug on Day 1 of cycle 1 followed by 28 days of observation. HY-0102 will be administered IV once every two weeks for Cycle 2 and beyond.
