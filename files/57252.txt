Plan for Microwave Thermal Field
Develop an intelligent system based on contrast-enhanced ultrasound and clinical information to help doctors automatically obtain ablation parameters (ablation needle number, ablation needle type, ablation time,ablation power) when preparing to use microwave ablation to treat hepatocellular carcinoma
Hepatocellular Carcinoma|Ablation
PROCEDURE: Microwave Thermal guided by Plan for Microwave Thermal Field system
MRI within 3 days after ablation, Postoperative MRI is used to determine whether the ablation zone completely covers the tumor and whether the size is appropriate, MRI within 3 days after ablation|local tumor progression, Follow up to observe whether local tumor progression occurs within 6 months after ablation, 6 months
Develop an intelligent system based on contrast-enhanced ultrasound and clinical information to help doctors automatically obtain ablation parameters (ablation needle number, ablation needle type, ablation time,ablation power) when preparing to use microwave ablation to treat hepatocellular carcinoma
