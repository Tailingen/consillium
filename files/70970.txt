Phase I Study of SPH1188-11 in NSCLC
This study will treat patients with advanced NSCLC who have already received at least one course of specific anti-cancer treatment but the tumour has started to re-grow following that treatment. This is the first time this drug has ever been tested in patients, and so it will help to understand what type of side effects may occur with the drug treatment, it will measure the levels of drug in the body, it will also measure the anti-cancer activity. By using these pieces of information together the best dose of this drug to use in further clinical trials will be selected.
