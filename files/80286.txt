Study to Evaluate Immune Responses in Neurologically Normal Cancer Patients
The purpose of this study is to study whether immune cells capable of killing tumors that express proteins associated with paraneoplastic neurologic syndrome (PNS) can be found in small cell lung cancer and ovarian cancer patients. The presence of these cells may play a role in tumor immunity in these patients. The protocol involves neurological examinations and collection of blood.
Cancer
Paraneoplastic neoplastic disease antibody titer, Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte activity, and clinical data in neurologically normal patients with small cell lung cancer and gynecologic tumors, with tumors unrelated to PNDs, and in normal control patients., Duration of study
