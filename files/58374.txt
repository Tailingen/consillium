IDENTIFICATION OF SENTINEL NODE(S) IN BREAST CANCER
The study is based on the identification of sentinel node(s) by SENTIMAG / SIENNA + in addition to the usual method (blue and /or radioactive product). This is a feasibility study
BREAST CANCER
PROCEDURE: Excision of sentinel node(s)
Sentinel node(s)detected with new technical, Idenfication 's rate of sentinel nodes detected with new technical(SentiMag ® / Sienna + TM), The day of surgery
Detected node(s) for each method(standard and new), Proportion of detected nodes for each method(standard and new), The day of surgery
* Identification of Sentinel node(s)

  1. Step 1: Identification using the technique Nanocis Sub-areolar injection of Tc99m-Nanocis ® the day before or the day of surgery
  2. Step 2: Identification using the technique SentiMag ® / Sienna+ Injection Sienna + ™ should be done just after induction of anesthesia and before the injection of Patent Blue dye
  3. Step 3: Identification using the technique of Patent Blue Dye or Lymphotropic dye injection or Patent Blue is performed after induction of anesthesia, the injection and production Sienna + ™, the operating theater by the surgeon
* Detection of Sentinel node(s)

  1. Step 1: probe SentiMag ® (study)
  2. Step 2: hand probe gamma radiation detection and / or colorimetric detection (standard)
* Sentinel node's excision of radioactive and / or blue and / or magnetic (colored brown-brown)
* After the procedure:

Characterization of the size and weight of lymph nodes, histological and / or molecular OSNA and linking nodal status with the detection rate of sentinel nodes for each technique.

NB: In case of synchronous bilateral cancer, 2 records are possible
