Comparison of CE-DBT and MRI in Patients With Known Breast Lesions
The purpose of this pilot study is to compare radiologist confidence level in evaluating patients with known breast lesions between contrast enhanced digital breast tomosynthesis (CE- DBT) and contrast enhanced dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) acquired as a part of a standard clinical workup.

This is a pilot study of CE-DBT scans to evaluate its utility relative to breast CE-MRI. Twenty women who have planned or received conventional breast MRI imaging at UNC Hospitals will be recruited for the study. Participants will be scanned with the DBT system after the administration of iodinated contrast agent. Images will be acquired prior to the administration of contrast, followed by at approximately 2 minutes and 5 minutes. For the purposes of this study, imaging will focus on a single breast to simplify data acquisition.
