Development and Validation of a Personalized Digital Healthcare Model for Managing Side Effects in Breast Cancer Survivors
The ultimate goal of this research and development is to develop personalized digital healthcare technologies and self-management strategies based on self-assessment results and evidence, for breast cancer survivors who require management and recovery from acute and chronic side effects related to various treatments (surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, hormone therapy, etc.). Additionally, the aim is to verify the clinical applicability and establish a service model to address the diverse unmet healthcare needs of breast cancer survivors.
