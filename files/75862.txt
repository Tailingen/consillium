Phase II Study of PX-12 in Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
This study is being conducted to evaluate the clinical efficacy, biologic activity (inhibition of PX-12 target thioredoxin-1) and effects of an expired metabolite of PX-12 in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.
Pancreatic Neoplasms
DRUG: PX-12
Progression free survival and overall survival (percentage of patients alive at 6 months), 6 months|Determine if there is a difference in effect on circulating Trx-1 protein levels between two dose levels of PX-12, 21 days
Determine which of two dose levels of PX-12 causes the greatest effect on three surrogate markers of clinical activity, 42 days|Determine effects of two different dose levels on overall clinical response, 42 days|Further evaluate safety profile of PX-12, 21 days|Assess the effects of metabolic excretion of PX-12, 3 hours
In a Phase I trial, PX-12 demonstrated anti-tumor activity and pharmacodynamic activity across a wide dose range. At higher doses, one side effect of the agent was a garlic-like odor of an expired metabolite. This study is being conducted to evaluate the clinical efficacy, biologic activity (inhibition of PX-12 target thioredoxin-1) and effects of the expired metabolite at two dose levels of PX-12. This study will determine if the efficacy and biologic activity achieved at either of the two dose levels is sufficient to proceed to further studies without pushing to the maximally tolerated dose.
