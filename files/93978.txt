Trial of Five Versus Six Fractions Per Week for Head and Neck Cancer
This trial compares the use of 6 fractions versus the standard 5 fractions of radiotherapy used in the treatment of head and neck cancer.
Head and Neck Cancer
RADIATION: Accelerated Radiotherapy Fractionation|RADIATION: Accelerated Radiotherapy Fractionation
Three Years Loco-regional Control, 3 years
Disease-specific Survival, 8 years|Overall Survival, 8 years|Acute Adverse Effects|Late Adverse Effects, 8 years
The purpose of this trial is to study the clinical effects of increasing the weekly fraction number for locally advanced head and neck cancers by a multi-institutional prospective randomised trial. The primary endpoint is to clarify whether a six fraction per week protocol has a greater effect on the survival, as compared to the conventional five fraction per week protocol.
