Study of HS-20105 for Injection in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors.
HS-20105 is a novel antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) targeting Trop-2. This first-in-human trial is aimed to assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT), to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and preliminary anti-tumor activity of HS-20105 in patients with advanced solid tumors.

This is a multicenter, open-label Phase I clinical study evaluating the safety, tolerability, PK, and efficacy of HS-20105 in patients with advanced solid tumors. The study includes Phase Ia (dose escalation) and Phase Ib (dose extension). Phase Ia will conduct a dose escalation using the "Rolling 6" design in advanced solid tumor patients who have failed or are unable to tolerate standard treatment, to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK characteristics, and efficacy of HS-20105. The subsequent Phase Ib study will be conducted in certain population to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of HS-20105 at different doses and in different populations.
