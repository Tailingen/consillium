Multi-dose-escalation Safety and Pharmacokinetic Study of SAR3419 as Single Agent in Relapsed/Refractory B-cell Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma
The primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of SAR3419 and to characterize the dose limiting toxicity(ies). Secondary objectives are to determine the anti-lymphoma activity, the global safety and the PK profile.
