A Study Evaluating the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Clinical Effects of Intravenously Administered PT-112 Injection in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors and Subsequent Dose Expansion Cohorts
This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, multi-center, non-randomized, dose-escalation study to be conducted in two parts: the Dose Escalation Phase and the Dose Expansion Phase. The Dose Escalation Phase will determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose(s) (RP2D) of PT-112 Injection and evaluate its safety and tolerability, and PK (pharmacokinetics).

The Dose Escalation Phase is complete and no longer enrolling.

The Dose Expansion Phase has two cohorts: one cohort for the study of PT-112 in patients with thymoma and thymic carcinoma (Cohort A), and one cohort for the study of PT-112 in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) (Cohort D).
