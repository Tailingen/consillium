A Dose Finding and Expansion Study of RO7051790 Administered Orally in Participants With Relapsed, Extensive-Stage Disease Small Cell Lung Cancer (ED SCLC)
This is a Phase I, open-label, multicenter study designed to assess the safety and tolerability of RO7051790 in participants with relapsed ED SCLC. This dose escalation and expansion study plans to determine the maximum tolerated dose and/or optimal biological dose as a recommended Phase 2 dose for RO7051790, based on the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles observed after oral administration of RO7051790.
Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: RO7051790
Percentage of Participants with Adverse Events, Baseline up to approximately 18 weeks|Number of Participants with Dose-Limited Toxicities (DLTs), DLTs were to be assessed based on the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03. DLTs were at least possibly related to RO7051790 and had to meet any one of the following criteria: Grade≥4 neutropenia lasting \>7 days; Grade 4 thrombocytopenia; Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding; Grade≥4 anemia; Febrile neutropenia; Grade≥3 elevation in serum hepatic transaminase lasting \>7 days; Grade≥3 elevation of serum bilirubin; and Grade≥3 non-hematologic, non-hepatic adverse event (with few exceptions)., First treatment cycle (21 days)
Percentage of Participants with Best Confirmed Overall Response, Best Confirmed Overall Response was evaluated according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). Complete Response (CR) included the disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR) was at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD) was at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions; and Stable Disease (SD) was neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD., Time from first study treatment to the time of progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (Assessed every 6 weeks up to approximately 18 weeks)|Percentage of Participants with Objective Response According to RECIST, Objective response was defined as the percentage of participants with a Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) as defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions; PR was defined as a 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions., Time from first study treatment to the time of progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (assessed every 6 weeks up to approximately 18 weeks)|Duration of Response According to RECIST v1.1, Duration of response was defined as the interval between the date of the first documented response by RECIST to the date of first disease progression or death, whichever occurred earlier., Time from first occurrence of a documented objective response to the time of progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (assessed every 6 weeks up to approximately 18 weeks)|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) According to RECIST v1.1, Progression-free survival was defined as the time from the first administration of any study treatment to the first disease progression using RECIST or death from any cause, whichever occurred first., Time from first study treatment to the time of progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (assessed every 6 weeks up to approximately 18 weeks)|Overall Survival (OS), Time from first study treatment to death from any cause (up to approximately 12 months)|Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of RO7051790, Predose (0 hours [hrs]) on Day 1 of every cycle until end of treatment (up to 18 weeks, each cycle is 21 days); Cycles 1 and 2: 1,2,4,6,8 (only in Cycle 1) hrs postdose on Day 1 and on Days 2 (only in Cycle 1), 4, 5 (only in Cycle 1), 8,12,15,19|Minimum Observed Plasma Trough Concentration (Cmin) of RO7051790, Predose (0 hrs) on Day 1 of every cycle until end of treatment (up to 18 weeks, each cycle is 21 days)|Time to Reach Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Tmax) of RO7051790, Predose (0 hrs) on Day 1 of every cycle until end of treatment (up to 18 weeks, each cycle is 21 days); Cycles 1 and 2: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 (only in Cycle 1) hrs postdose on Day 1 and on Days 2 (only in Cycle 1), 4, 5 (only in Cycle 1), 8, 12, 15, 19|Plasma Decay Half-Life (t1/2) of RO7051790, Predose (0 hrs) on Day 1 of every cycle until end of treatment (up to 18 weeks, each cycle is 21 days); Cycles 1 and 2: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 (only in Cycle 1) hrs postdose on Day 1 and on Days 2 (only in Cycle 1), 4, 5 (only in Cycle 1), 8, 12, 15, 19|Area Under the Curve From Time Zero to Extrapolated Infinite Time (AUCinf) of RO7051790, Predose (0 hrs) on Day 1 of every cycle until end of treatment (up to 18 weeks, each cycle is 21 days); Cycles 1 and 2: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 (only in Cycle 1) hrs postdose on Day 1 and on Days 2 (only in Cycle 1), 4, 5 (only in Cycle 1), 8, 12, 15, 19|Area Under the Curve from Time Zero to End of Dosing Interval (AUCtau) of RO7051790, Predose (0 hrs) on Day 1 of every cycle until end of treatment (up to 18 weeks, each cycle is 21 days); Cycles 1 and 2: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 (only in Cycle 1) hrs postdose on Day 1 and on Days 2 (only in Cycle 1), 4, 5 (only in Cycle 1), 8, 12, 15, 19|Apparent Oral Clearance (CL/F) of RO7051790, Predose (0 hrs) on Day 1 of every cycle until end of treatment (up to 18 weeks, each cycle is 21 days); Cycles 1 and 2: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 (only in Cycle 1) hrs postdose on Day 1 and on Days 2 (only in Cycle 1), 4, 5 (only in Cycle 1), 8, 12, 15, 19|Apparent Volume of Distribution (Vz/F) of RO7051790, Predose (0 hrs) on Day 1 of every cycle until end of treatment (up to 18 weeks, each cycle is 21 days); Cycles 1 and 2: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 (only in Cycle 1) hrs postdose on Day 1 and on Days 2 (only in Cycle 1), 4, 5 (only in Cycle 1), 8, 12, 15, 19|Accumulation Ratio (RA) of RO7051790, Predose (0 hrs) on Day 1 of every cycle until end of treatment (up to 18 weeks, each cycle is 21 days); Cycles 1 and 2: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 (only in Cycle 1) hrs postdose on Day 1 and on Days 2 (only in Cycle 1), 4, 5 (only in Cycle 1), 8, 12, 15, 19
