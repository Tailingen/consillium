A Study to Compare Health Care Costs Between Apixaban and Low Molecular Weight Heparin in Patients With Venous Thromboembolism and Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the health care resource utilization and costs associated with treating patients diagnosed with cancer and venous thromboembolism with apixaban or low molecular weight heparin. This is a retrospective database analysis of health care claims data. All-cause costs as well as costs associated with recurrent VTE, major bleeding, and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding will be assessed.
