Finding Barriers and Designing Solutions to Promote Women s Cancer Screening in South Africa
The primary aim of the study explore drivers of cervical cancer screening and barriers contributing to low screening coverage among women in South Africa. Secondary aims are determining preferences for cervical cancer prevention services using a discrete choice experiment and developing a multi-level package of interventions that will address barriers to cervical cancer screening and improve engagement in care among women.

Phase 1: Barriers to cancer screening and engagement, Barriers and enablers will be explored through focus groups and in-depth interviews with women, men, and other stakeholders., Single visit
Phase 2: Woman preferences for cancer screening services, Preferences for cancer screening will be determined through the relative importance of the attribute according on how it is scored in the Discrete Choice Experiment., Single visit|Phase 3: Acceptability and feasibility of multi-level package of interventions addressing barriers to cancer screening., Acceptability and feasibility will be measured through development and user pre-testing workshops., Single visit
Cervical cancer is a leading cause of cancer death among South African women. Despite a comprehensive national cancer control policy, cervical screening coverage is low and attrition during on-ward referrals for diagnostic confirmation and treatment remains common.

This study uses a sequential mixed-methods design:

Phase 1) A qualitative exploratory phase using focus groups and in-depth interviews with women, men, other stakeholders will inform our design and interpretation of quantitative findings from a multi-cohort DCE.

Phase 2) Women will be recruited to participate in the DCE and determine their preferences for cancer screening services.

Phase 3) Design Thinking to co-create an intervention package for cervical cancer screening and enhanced linkage between screening, diagnosis, and treatment will be created.
