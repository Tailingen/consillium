Vitamin E δ-Tocotrienol Administered to Subjects With Resectable Pancreatic Exocrine Neoplasia
The purpose of this study is to determine the safest dose of the study drug Vitamin E Delta-tocotrienol, how often it should be taken, and how well people with pancreatic tumors tolerate Vitamin E Delta-tocotrienol.
Pancreatic Neoplasms
DRUG: Vitamin E δ-Tocotrienol
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), To determine the recommended Phase II dose of Vitamin E δ-Tocotrienol which will be defined as the biologic effective dose (BED) which induces significant apoptosis in the pancreatic neoplastic cells of resected tumor specimens following oral administration of Vitamin E δ-Tocotrienol twice daily for 14 (± 2)days prior to surgery, and one dose the day of surgery., 12 weeks per participant
Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), To characterize the safety and tolerability of Vitamin E δ-Tocotrienol when orally administered at up to 5.6 times the predicted biological effective dose (1600mg twice daily) for 14 (± 2) consecutive days and one dose the day of surgery in patients with pancreatic neoplasia., 12 weeks per participant
Delta-tocotrienol is a natural Vitamin E compound that has been consumed by humans as a dietary supplement. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved it for sale as a drug. Vitamin E Delta-tocotrienol is being investigated for the prevention and treatment of pancreatic tumors. The usefulness of the Vitamin E Delta-tocotrienol in treating human tumors is unknown.

This study consists of the following: (1) a Pre-Treatment Period in which participants are consented and qualified for the study; (2) a Study Treatment Period in which participant will receive Vitamin E δ-Tocotrienol administered orally twice daily for 14 (±2) consecutive days and once on the day of surgery, with associated pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic sampling; (3) a Post Treatment Period in which laboratory and physical examinations are performed. Adverse events will be recorded throughout the study.
