The Efficacy of Precision Treatment for Gastric Cancer Guided by Molecular Profiling
Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common and lethal cancers worldwide, especially in China, and the median overall survival for patients with advanced, metastatic GC remains only about 1 year. Several molecular profiling studies have demonstrated that a proportion of gastric cancer harbour actionable molecular alterations which shows a predictive benefit from a specific therapy (in any cancer type). In the current study, the efficacy of precision treatment for gastric cancer guided by multidimensional molecular biology profiling will be observed. The analysis focused on the overall survival outcomes for patients whose tumours harboured actionable molecular alterations and who received appropriately matched therapy.
Gastric Cancer
Overall survival, Overall survival was measured from the date of advanced disease until death., up to 3 years|Progression-free survival, The PFS was calculated from the date of advanced disease to the date of disease progression or death, up to 3 years
Positive rate, Actionable molecular alterations detected by molecular profiling, up to 3 years
