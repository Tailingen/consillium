A Study to Compare PK, Immunogenicity and Safety of Trastuzumab of Incepta Pharmaceuticals Ltd With Trastuzumab (Roche)
Trastuzumab is an Ig G1 kappa, humanized monoclonal antibody which is most abundant subclass of IgG, that works against overexpress of HER2 (Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Type 2). Trastuzumab is used to treat HER2-positive breast, gastroesophageal, and gastric cancers. HER2 regulate cell growth and survival, as well as adhesion, migration, differentiation and other cellular response. But when HER2 signaling is over expressed it causes uncontrolled cell growth which leads to the formation of cancerous tumor.

Cmax, Maximum Observed Drug Concentration In Plasma, 71 days from the starting of infusion|AUC0-t, Area Under The Concentration Versus Time Curve Up To The Last Measurable Time Point, 71 days from the starting of infusion|AUC0-inf, Area Under The Concentration Versus Time Curve From Time 0 To Infinity, 71 days from the starting of infusion|Safety assessment: The number of adverse events will be evaluated and compared between the reference and test drugs groups., No of adverse events in both reference and test product arm will be assessed and compared by monitoring the presence of any AEs or SAEs throughout the study period., 71 days from the starting of infusion|Immunogenicity assessment: Immunogenicity will be assessed by measuring Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADA) formation., The incidence of Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADA) formation will be measured by taking blood samples on before treatment (pre-dose) and and on day 71, 71 days from the starting of infusion
In this study, healthy adult male volunteers will receive a single intravenous administration of Trastuzumab (Incepta) or Trastuzumab (Roche) according to randomization. During the course of the study, the pharmacokinetics will be assessed by sampling the levels of the drug in the blood and by comparing these levels among the different administration arms. Safety and immunologic response will also be evaluated throughout the study.
