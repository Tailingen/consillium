A Prospective Study To Identify Predictive Biological Markers In Blood And Cyst Fluid Aspirates From Patients With Pancreatic Cyst Lesions
The purpose To determine the diagnostic potential of various biological markers in blood and cyst fluid aspirates from patients with Pancreatic Cystic Lesions (PCLs).

Research design This is a 10-year prospective cohort and pancreatic cyst fluid repository study enrolling all patients diagnosed with pancreatic cyst and undergoing the cyst aspiration.

Procedures to be used Blood Sample Cyst Fluid Sample

Data Collection:

Medical Record Number Demographics (age, sex, gender, race) Contact information History of alcohol use and IV and other recreational drugs and narcotics use/abuse Medication history Past hospitalizations, diagnoses, and treatment Physical examination findings Imaging data of abdominal and chest regions, including and not limited to ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) Future admissions, diagnoses, treatment including histopathological findings of resected specimens and blood reports End of study data: clinical progression of disease, cyst size, wall thickening, calcification, communication with pancreatic duct, string sign, cytology, immunohistochemical findings, assay levels of lipase, amylase CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen), carbohydrate antigen19-9 (CA 19-9), and other biomarkers.

Risks and potential benefits The risks associated with this study are slight discomfort or bruising from the blood sampling and the possible loss of confidentiality if the patient data or information is inadvertently disclosed outside of this study. The patient will not receive any additional benefit from the study aside from those received as part of routine standard of care.

Importance of knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result The knowledge gained from this study may benefit other patients with Pancreatic Cyst Lesions in the future.
