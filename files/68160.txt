Safety and Efficacy of OBX-115 in Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a study to investigate the safety and efficacy of an investigational OBX-115 regimen in adult participants with advanced solid tumors.

BIOLOGICAL: OBX-115
Incidence and nature of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), • Incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) during the first 28 days after OBX-115 infusion (Phase 1)., 28 Days|The proportion of participants who have a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST v1.1, • The proportion of participants who have a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST v1.1 as assessed by the Investigator from the date of OBX-115 infusion until disease progression, death, start of a new anticancer therapy, withdrawal of consent, or end of study, whichever comes first (Phase 2), 2 years
The proportion of participants who have a confirmed CR or PR per RECIST v1.1, • The proportion of participants who have a confirmed CR or PR per RECIST v1.1 as assessed by the Investigator from the date of OBX-115 infusion until disease progression, death, start of a new anticancer therapy, withdrawal of consent, or end of study, whichever comes first (Phase 1), 2 years|Incidence of AEs, • Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), including SAEs, study intervention related AEs, and AEs leading to early discontinuation of study intervention or withdrawal from the Assessment Period or death up to 2 years after initiation of study intervention, 2 years
Primary Objective (Phase 1):

• Assess the safety and tolerability of OBX-115 regimen

Primary Objective (Phase 2):

• Evaluate preliminary efficacy of OBX-115 regimen as measured by the investigator using objective response rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1

Secondary (Phase 1):

• Assess preliminary efficacy of OBX-115 regimen by evaluating ORR

Secondary (Phase 2):

• Evaluate safety and tolerability of OBX 115 based on the collected AE data

Secondary (both Phase 1 and Phase 2):

* Evaluate duration of response (DOR): To evaluate the duration from the time that criteria are met for CR or PR per RECIST v1.1 as assessed by the investigator until disease progression or death due to cancer.
* Evaluate disease control rate (DCR): To evaluate the percentage of participants with a best overall confirmed response of CR or PR at any time plus stable disease (SD) for at least 4 weeks per RECIST v1.1 as assessed by the investigator.
* Evaluate progression-free survival (PFS): To evaluate the time from the date of OBX-115 infusion until disease progression per RECIST v1.1 as assessed by the investigator or death due to any cause.
* Evaluate overall survival (OS): To evaluate the time from the date of OBX-115 infusion to death due to any cause
* Evaluate feasibility of the manufacturing process: Evaluated as the proportion of OBX-115 products initiated for manufacturing that pass release criteria for infusion.
