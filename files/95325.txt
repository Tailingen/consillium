Study of CT071 Injection in High Risk Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma
This trial is a single-arm, single-center, open-label clinical trial to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and metabolism kinetics of CT071 in patients with high-risk newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Chimeric antigen receptor modified T cells Infusion
Adverse Events (AE) after CT071 infusion, An assessment of severity grade will be made according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), with the exception of cytokine release syndrome (CRS), and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS)., From first dose of study drug administration to end of treatment (up to 24 months)|Overall response rate (ORR), ORR defined as proportion of patients achieving partial response or better based on International Myeloma Working Group defined response criteria, From first dose of study drug administration to end of treatment (up to 24 months)|Recommended Phase II Dose of CT071 in patients with high-risk newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, Evaluate Dose limited toxicity and adverse events after CT071 infusion, Assessed from the date of first dose of study treatment until 28 days
