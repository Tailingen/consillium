Early Detection of Lung Cancer With Machine Learning Based on Routine Clinical Investigations
This observational, cross-sectional study in lung cancer patients and lung cancer-free controls aims to develop a machine learning model for early detection of LC based on routine, widely accessible and minimally invasive clinical investigations. The model with adequate predictive performance could later be used in clinical practice as an aid in defining the optimal population and timing for lung cancer screening program.

Develop a model with high predictive performance for early detection of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the eligible patient population., The primary outcome is tested by calculating a joint rectangular 95% confidence region for {sensitivity, specificity} and compared with the reported accuracy of NLST study screening criteria., 11 years
Demonstrate that the newly developed model achieves higher prediction accuracy than the well-validated model PLCOm2012., 11 years
Develop a model with high predictive performance for early detection of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in the eligible patient population., 11 years|Develop a model for prediction of lung cancer in a time period when the disease is still highly unlikely to be clinically detectable, in a subset of patients who meet the extended eligibility criteria., 11 years|Identify features with the highest discriminatory power of lung cancer prediction and early detection., 11 years|Identify features with the highest discriminatory power to distinguish between lung cancer patients in stage I-II and stage III-IV., 11 years
