DLT, Dose at which no toxic effect is observed, by determination of the LDT (Toxic Limit Dose). A TLD is defined by the occurrence of grade ≥ 3 daratumumab related toxicity that is not reversible after 7 days (except for haematological toxicity) or the absence of emergence from aplasia at D45 of induction (in the absence of treatment failure). Toxicity is assessed according to NCI-CTCAE version 5 criteria. The search for DLT is continued until D45 of induction., DAY 45
