On Dose Efficiency of Modern CT-scanners in Chest Scans
CT scans of the chest / thorax are of great importance both in the initial diagnosis and in the follow-up of pulmonary or thoracic diseases. As an example, CT angiography of the pulmonary arteries (CTPA) is worldwide considered to be gold standard test in patients with a suspicion for pulmonary embolism.

The aim of this study is to measure and compare dose efficiency of modern CT scanners for unenhanced and contrast-enhanced scan protocols of the chest/thorax. Patients who are referred for a CT of the chest/thorax will be randomly assigned to one of the three CT scanners currently in use at our institution.
Pneumonia|Lung Cancer|Pulmonary Embolism|Pulmonary Disease|Aortic Stenosis
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Imaging on Scanner with Spectral Imaging Capabilities|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: CT Scan using an Energy-Integrating Detector CT (128 slice MDCT)|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: CT Scan using an Energy-Integrating Detector CT (20-slice MDCT)
Parameters of Objective Image Quality, Measured as signal, image noise and modulation transfer function equivalent parameters, 1 year|Parameters of Radiation Dose, measured as x-ray tube parameters such as dose length product (DLP), 1 year
Subjective Image Quality Evaluation (entire cohort and for individual disease groups), measured by blinded evaluation by radiologists, 1 year
