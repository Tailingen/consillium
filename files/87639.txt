A Study of Docetaxel for Injection (Albumin-bound) and SG001 in Combination With Cisplatin and Simultaneous Radiotherapy for Locally Advanced Unresectable Esophageal Squamous Carcinoma.
The study is a multicenter, open-label, phase Ib/II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of docetaxel for injection (albumin-bound) (HB1801) and SG001 in combination with cisplatin and simultaneous radiotherapy versus paclitaxel in combination with cisplatin and simultaneous radiotherapy for locally advanced unresectable esophageal squamous carcinoma.

Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of Docetaxel for Injection (Albumin-bound), At the end of Cycle 2 (each cycle is 21 days)|Incidence and frequency of adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE) in Phase Ib, up to 4 years|PFS as determined by the investigator according to RECIST 1.1 in Phase Ⅱ, up to 4 years
Objective remission rate (ORR), up to 4 years|Disease control rate (DCR), up to 4 years|Duration of remission (DOR), up to 4 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), up to 4 years|Overall survival (OS), up to 4 years|Incidence of SG001 antidrug antibodies and neutralizing antibodies (if applicable), up to 4 years|Incidence and frequency of adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE) in Phase Ⅱ, up to 4 years
Total docetaxel concentration in plasma and free docetaxel concentration, up to 4 years|SG001 concentration in serum, up to 4 years|To evaluate the correlation between PD-L1 expression and efficacy in tumor tissues, up to 4 years
This study will be conducted in two stages. The first stage (Phase Ib) is a dose-escalation study designed to determine the safety and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of HB1801 and SG001 in combination with cisplatin and simultaneous radiotherapy for locally advanced unresectable esophageal squamous carcinoma. Patients will be assigned to receive sequentially higher doses of HB1801 once every three weeks (a Cycle) by intravenous infusion, starting at a dose of 60 mg/m\^2. The second stage (Phase II) is a study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of HB1801 and SG001 in combination with cisplatin and simultaneous radiotherapy versus paclitaxel in combination with cisplatin and simultaneous radiotherapy for locally advanced unresectable esophageal squamous carcinoma. Regular visits and imaging examinations will be conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of the two groups.
