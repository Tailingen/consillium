Recurrence Free Survival (RFS), This is an event driven trial. Recurrence-free survival time (RFS) is computed from the earliest of the date of recurrence or death or, if without recurrence or death, the date last assessed for recurrence without diagnosis of recurrence (censored). The date of recurrence is specified as the first date a recurrence is suspected, which is later confirmed by biopsy., 436 events or approximately 4 years
Overall Survival (OS), Survival time is computed based on the date of death if the subject is known dead or the date last known to be alive (censored). Zero time is the date of randomization., 432 events or approximately 10 years
