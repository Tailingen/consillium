Phase 1 Study of the Combination of Rogaratinib With Copanlisib in Patients With Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor (FGFR)-Positive, Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and efficacy of rogaratinib in combination with copanlisib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors that are mRNA-positive for at least one FGFR1-4 subtype.

The secondary objectives of this study are to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of rogaratinib and copanlisib alone and in combination, and to assess the anti-tumor efficacy of rogaratinib in combination with copanlisib for locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors that are mRNA-positive for at least one FGFR1-4 subtype.
