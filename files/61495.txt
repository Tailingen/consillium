Transarterial Chemoembolization (TACE) Therapy of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) With Blocking Tumor Blood Temporarily and Enhancing Perfusion
According to radiology imaging, the patients of HCC are divided into two groups(hypovascular tumor group and moderately vascular tumor group). Every group is divided into TACE therapy with balloon catheter subgroup and regular TACE therapy subgroup. Patients take the TACE therapy each 45 days, and have MRI diffusion examine or CT one week before next therapy. All objects are observed until the end event happening or in the group for 6 months.
