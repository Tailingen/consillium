ACOU085 for Hearing Loss Prevention in Testicular Cancer Patients Receiving Cisplatin
Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter phase IIa clinical trial in adult male TCa patients with the risk to suffer from sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) due to cisplatin therapy within a chemotherapeutic regimen of testicular cancer. Patients will have an indication for a cisplatin-containing chemotherapy according to current guidelines and trial site tumor board recommendations. The trial is designed to show efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ACOU085 administered into the middle ear using 3 transtympanic injections per ear prior to 3 planned and corresponding 3-week chemotherapeutic cycles. The intra-individual control will be done by placebo injection into the respective contralateral middle ear.
