Gallium-68 Labeled LM3 PET/CT in Neuroendocrine Tumors
LM3 is a novel somatostatin receptor antagonist, while Gallium-68 DOTATATE is a typical somatostatin receptor agonist, This study is to evaluate the safety, biodistribution, dosimetry, and lesion detection ability of Gallium-68 labeled somatostatin receptor antagonist LM3 for the diagnostic imaging of metastatic, well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors using positron emission tomography / computed tomography (PET/CT).

The results will be compared between antagonist Gallium-68 labeled LM3 and agonist Gallium-labeled DOTATATE in the same group of patients.

It will also be compared between the two different antagonists, Gallium-68 DOTA-LM3 and Gallium-68 NODAGA-LM3, in two parallel-designed arms.

Patients with histologically confirmed metastatic, well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors will be recruited in this study.

All patients will be randomized into two groups: Gallium-68 NODAGA-LM3 group and Gallium-68 DOTA-LM3 group.

The study will be divided into the following 2 parts:

Part ONE, which will enroll 16 patients (8 in each group), focuses on the safety evaluation, biodistribution, and dosimetry. In Part A, patients will undergo serial whole-body PET/CT scans at multiple time points (5m, 10m, 20m, 40m, 1h, 2h) after administering 40ug/150-200MBq Gallium-68 NODAGA-LM3 or Gallium-68 DOTA-LM3 (according to their group).

Part TWO, which will enroll 24 patients (12 in each group) and follows Part A study, focuses on lesion detection ability. In Part B, patients will undergo one whole-body PET/CT scan at 1 hour after administering 40ug/150-200MBq Gallium-68 NODAGA-LM3 or Gallium-68 DOTA-LM3 (according to their group).

All patients need to do a Gallium-68 DOTATATE PET/CT scan (40ug/150-200MBq, 1h post-injection) for comparison on the next day.
