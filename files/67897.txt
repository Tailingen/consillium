Perioperative Tislelizumab Combined With Nab-Paclitaxel for Muscle-invasive Urothelial Bladder Cancer: A Multicenter Study
This is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter clinical trial to investigate the safety and efficacy of tislelizumab when given in combination with nab-paclitaxel as perioperative treatment in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) prior to cystectomy or complete TURBT. Patients will receive perioperative treatment with tislelizumab in combination with nab-paclitaxel every 3 weeks for 3 treatment cycles over 9 weeks followed by radical cystectomy or complete TURBT.

complete response (CR) rate, defined as the percentage of participants having CR. CR is defined as absence of viable tumor in examined tissue, At the time of complete transurethral resection of bladder tumor or radical cystectomy (within 12 weeks of the first dose of tislelizumab)
Number of subjects that reach pathological downstaging to <pT2, defined as pT0-T1N0M0 at the time of cystectomy or cTURBT, At the time of complete transurethral resection of bladder tumor or radical cystectomy (within 12 weeks of the first dose of tislelizumab)|Objective response rate (ORR), defined as the proportion of patients who have a partial or complete response to therapy, At the time of complete transurethral resection of bladder tumor or radical cystectomy (within 12 weeks of the first dose of tislelizumab)|Event-free survival (EFS), defined from D1 of neoadjuvant treatment until progression (in those who progress prior to surgery) or until recurrence (post-surgery) or until death as a result of any cause., up to 3 years|Overall Survival (OS), defined as the number of days from study entry to death. Individuals who are alive at last contact will be censored on the date of last contact., up to 3 years|Number of adverse events and severity by grade (CTCAE), Safety and toxicity will be characterized according to the reported adverse event (AE) profile using NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0, as well as a patient questionnaire derived from the Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO)-CTCAE and Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)., up to 1 years
