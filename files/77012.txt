Chemoradiotherapy Followed by Planned Surgery or by Surveillance and Surgery Only When Needed for Oesophageal Cancer
NEEDS is a pragmatic open-label, randomised, controlled, phase III, multicenter trial with non-inferiority design with regard to the first co-primary endpoint overall survival and superiority for the experimental intervention definitive chemoradiotherapy. A second co-primary endpoint is global health related quality of life (HRQOL) one year after randomisation. A third co-primary endpoint is eating restictions one year after randomisation.

The aim is to compare outcomes after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy with subsequent esophagectomy to definitive chemoradiotherapy with surveillance and salvage esophagectomy as needed in patients with resectable locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the esophagus, with the aim to provide generalisable guidance for future clinical practice.

Weight (in kg) will be measured at all visits., Up to 5 years after randomisation|Nutritional outcomes - dysphagia, Dysphagia will be evaluated at all visits according to the CTC adverse event scale, grading from 0 (no problems) to 4 (worst problems)., Up to 5 years after randomisation|Gender stratified analyses of all endpoints, Up to 5 years after randomisation
