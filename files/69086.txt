Safety and Efficacy Study of a Dual PI3K Delta/Gamma Inhibitor in Hematological Malignancies
The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of RP6530, a dual PI3K delta/gamma inhibitor in patients with hematologic malignancies.
Lymphoma, B-Cell|T-Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: RP6530
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and pharmacokinetics (PK) of RP6530, * To access maximum tolerated dose by clinical laboratory assessments, adverse events and dose limiting toxicities.
* PK parameter AUC, Cmax, tmax, t1/2 will be determined., 28 days
Clinical response following administration of RP6530, Overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR)., 8 weeks
The Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be determined based on the safety, pharmacokinetic (PK) and efficacy data. Safety analyses include AE's, AE's related to the drug, SAE's, laboratory values, vitals/ ECG and dose limiting toxicity (DLT). PK include measurement of peak plasma concentration (Cmax), area under the plasma concentration versus the time curve (AUC), time of maximum concentration observed (Tmax). Efficacy analyses include overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR).
