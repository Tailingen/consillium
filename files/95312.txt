A Dye for the Detection of Cancer of the Tongue and Mouth
The purpose of this study is to test if an investigational dye, called PARPi-FL, can be used to detect this type of cancer. This will be the first time that PARPi-FL is being tried in people. First, the investigators will test the safety of PARPi-FL at different doses to find out what effects, if any, it has on people. The investigators will also see which amount of PARPi-FL is best suited to detect cancers of the mouth and tongue.
