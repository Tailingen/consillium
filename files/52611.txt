A Phase 1 Dose Escalation and Expansion Study of AK117
This is a multicenter, open label, single arm, Phase 1ï¼Œdose escalation and dose expansion study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, PK, immunogenicity, and preliminary antitumor activity of AK117 administered intravenously to adult subjects with relapsed/refractory advanced or metastatic solid tumors or lymphomas.
Neoplasms Malignant
DRUG: AK117
Number of participants with adverse events (AEs), An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment., From the time of informed consent signed through 30 days after the last dose of AK117|Number of participants with a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), DLTs will be assessed during the first 21 days of treatment for dose-escalation phase and are defined as toxicities that meet pre-defined severity criteria, and assessed as having a suspected relationship to study drug, and unrelated to disease, disease progression, inter-current illness, or concomitant medications ., During the first 21 days
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR defined as the proportion of subjects who achieves a best overall response of CR or PR, assessed by Investigator per RECIST Version 1.1 for solid tumor or the Lugano 2014 Classification for lymphoma, Up to 2 years|Disease control rate (DCR), The DCR is defined as the proportion of subjects with CR, PR, or SD ., Up to 2 years|Maximum observed concentration (Cmax) of AK117, The endpoints for assessment of PK of AK104 include serum concentrations of AK117 at different timepoints after AK117 administration., From first dose of AK117 through to 30 days after last dose of AK117|Minimum observed concentration (Cmin) of AK117 at steady state, The endpoints for assessment of PK of AK104 include serum concentrations of AK117 at different timepoints after AK117 administration., From first dose of AK117 through to 30 days after last dose of AK117|Number of subjects who develop detectable anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), The immunogenicity of AK117 will be assessed by summarizing the number of subjects who develop detectable antidrug antibodies (ADAs)., From first dose of AK117 through to 30 days after last dose of AK117
The study comprises a dose escalation phase and a dose expansion phase. The phases will be conducted sequentially. Approximately 162 subjects will be enrolled in this study.
