Brentuximab Vedotin Followed by ABVD in Patients With Previously Untreated Hodgkin Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of two three-weekly 1.8 mg/kg Brentuximab vedotin administrations in untreated patients with Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL).
Hodgkin Lymphoma
DRUG: Brentuximab vedotin|DRUG: ABVD
Number of Participants with Complete Metabolic Response by FDG-PET, Complete Metabolic Response will be defined by Deauville score 1, 2, 3., between day +8 and day +15 from second administration of Brentuximab
Overall Response Rate (ORR), Up to 4 weeks from the end of full treatment program.|Progression Free Survival (PFS), at 1 year from the end of full treatment program.|Number of Participants with Adverse Events, All serious and on-serious adverse events will be assessed, from C1D1 of Brentuximab vedotin up to 1 year from the end of full treatment program.
This is a multicenter pilot phase II trial assessing 2 administrations of Brentuximab vedotin followed by PET scan and subsequent standard treatment with ABVD Â± Radiotherapy. 12 patients defined by inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled in one year. All subjects will be followed for disease evaluation every 3 months for one year after end of therapy until disease progression, death, initiation of alternative therapy, withdrawal of consent, or end of study. For all study procedures patient will be assigned a Unique Subject Identifier (SID) number that will be used to identify the subject during the screening process and throughout study participation. A master log will be maintained of all consented subjects and will document all screening failures (i.e. subjects who are consented but do not meet study eligibility criteria). Study records such as case report forms (CRFs) may be maintained electronically and require the same security and confidentiality as paper. Clinical information will not be released without written permission of the subject/legal representative, except as specified in the informed consent form
