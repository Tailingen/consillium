Mirvetuximab Soravtansine With Bevacizumab Versus Bevacizumab as Maintenance in Platinum-sensitive Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Peritoneal Cancer
GLORIOSA is a Phase 3 multicenter, open label study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of mirvetuximab Soravtansine as maintenance therapy in participants with platinum-sensitive ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancers with high folate receptor-alpha (FRα) expression.

Mirvetuximab Soravtansine (MIRV) is an investigational antibody drug conjugate designed to selectively kill cancer cells. The antibody (protein) part of MIRV targets tumors by delivering a cell-killing drug to the tumor cells carrying a tumor-associated protein called folate receptor alpha (FRα). It is being developed as maintenance therapy for the treatment of subjects with recurrent platinum-sensitive, highgrade epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancers with high folate receptor-alpha expression. Patients must have confirmation of FRα positivity by the Ventana FOLR1 Assay.
