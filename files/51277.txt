[18F]Fluoro-PEG-folate PET/CT Imaging in Epithelial Ovarian Cancer
The pre-operative assessment of intra-abdominal tumor load in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) remains unreliable with standard imaging modalities. The use of tumor targeted imaging, such as folate receptor (FR)-targeted positron emission tomography (PET) imaging could aid in the preoperative assessment of metastatic tumor load.

This study aims to evaluate the safety and tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of the \[18F\]fluoro-PEG-folate PET tracer and to assess the sensitivity and specificity of a \[18F\]fluoro-PEG-folate PET/CT scan for the preoperative detection of intra-abdominal metastatic lesions in patients with advanced stage epithelial ovarian cancer.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: [18F]fluoro-PEG-folate PET/CT scan
Tolerability of the [18F]fluoro-PEG-folate PET tracer, To assess the tolerability of the \[18F\]fluoro-PEG-folate PET tracer vital signs will be recorded every 15 minutes starting directly before administration and continued up to two hours after dosing. The endpoint for this study is the number of patients whose vital signs stayed within a normal range of their baseline., From administration up to two hours after administration|Arterial plasma input curve of the [18F]fluoro-PEG-folate tracer, Blood samples will be collected to determine the arterial plasma input curve of the tracer., At regular intervals up to 90 minutes post injection of the tracer.|Pharmacokinetic distribution of the [18F]fluoro-PEG-folate tracer, Blood samples will be collected to determine the pharmacokinetic distribution of the tracer., At regular intervals up to 90 minutes post injection of the tracer.|Safety of the [18F]fluoro-PEG-folate PET tracer, Total number of AEs and SAEs that occur during the observation period., Up to six weeks after the injection of the tracer.
Sensitivity and specificity, Sensitivity and specificity of the FR-targeted PET/CT scan for the detection of metastatic EOC lesions. Postoperative histopathology will serve as the gold standard., Up to 6 weeks after the FR-targeted PET/CT scan.
