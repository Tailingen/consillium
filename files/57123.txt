Malignant Pleural Effusion
Patient Experiences of living with malignant pleural effusion and different pleural procedures, Qualitative interviews - Interviews will be recorded on a digital audio recorder and then downloaded on to a password protected computer. The interviews will then be sent for transcription using secure email and anonymised.

We will perform thematic analysis on the interview data. This is a process to help explore the experiences of the subject as they describe it rather than looking at how they talk about the experience. Themes will be drawn from the data following coding. Common codes relating to a theme, for example pain, will be identified and examples of text used to demonstrate the theme extracted. This will ensure a wide variety of quotes across the interviews rather than focusing on one main or a subset of interviews. We will use an inductive approach whereby themes will emerge and not be developed in advance. Emerging codes will be checked by the supervisory team.
