Umbilical Cord Blood Transplantation In Patients With Hematologic Malignancies Using A Myeloablative Preparative Regimen
In this study, participants with high-risk hematologic malignancies undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), who do not have a suitable human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched related/sibling donor (MSD), matched unrelated donor (MURD) or killer-immunoglobulin receptors (KIR) ligand mismatched haploidentical donor identified, will receive an umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) using a myeloablative preparative regimen.

The preparative regimen includes fludarabine (75 mg/m2), fractionated total body irradiation (TBI) (10.0 Gy), and cyclophosphamide (120mg/kg) with mesna. Fludarabine will be given once a day at 25 mg/m2 for three days on day -10 to day -8, TBI will be given twice a day at 150 cGy for four days on day -7 to day -4, and cyclophosphamide will be given once a day for at 60mg/kg for two days on day -3 and day -2. Post-transplantation immunosuppression with cyclosporine and MMF will begin on day -3. Cord Blood infusion will occur on day 0 and G-CSF will start on day +1.

Event Free Survival (EFS) for Research Participants, Estimate EFS for research participants at one-year post transplant by using single unit umbilical cord blood. The event is defined as relapse, graft failure, death due to any cause. The number of participants who did not experience any of those events (relapse, graft failure, death due to any cause) at year 1 post-transplant was given., 1 year post-transplant
Number of Observational Arm Participants Engrafted, For patients enrolled in the observational arm (undergoing a double unit UCBT), the number of patients engrafted was given., 1 year|Number of Observational Arm Patients Who Relapsed, The number of observational arm patients who relapsed was given., 1 year|Number of Deaths of Observational Arm Patients, The number of observational arm patients who died was given., 1 year|Number of Observational Arm Patients With Transplant-related Mortality (TRM), The number of patients with TRM within the first 100 days post transplant was given., First 100 days|Number of Participants With Acute GVHD, The number of participants with incidence of acute GVHD by grade was given. Participants are graded on a scale from 1 to 4, with 1 being mild and 4 being severe., 1 year|Number of Participants With Chronic GVHD, Due to the small sample size, cumulative incidence analysis was not done. The incidence of chronic GVHD was evaluated using NIH Consensus Global Severity Scoring. The number of patients with incidence of chronic GVHD by severity was provided., 1 year|Time to Engraftment of Research Arm Participants, Platelet engraftment was defined as platelet count ≥20,000/mm\^3 for 3 consecutive tests performed on different days with no platelet transfusions in the preceding 7 days. Neutrophil engraftment will be defined as achieving ANC ≥ 500/mm3 for 3 consecutive tests performed on different days with evidence of donor cell engraftment. Descriptive statistics are provided., first 100 days post transplant|Incidence of Transplant-related Mortality (TRM), TRM is death occurring in patients in continuous complete remission. The numbers of patients with TRM was given., first 100 days post transplant|The Number of Participants With Transplant-related Morbidity, Any patient who had adverse events listed either as probable or definite in the first 100 days post-transplant are counted as transplant related morbidity. The number of patients with transplant-related morbidity was given., first 100 days post transplant
The primary objectives is to estimate the event-free survival (EFS) at one-year post-transplant for research participants with high-risk hematologic malignancies undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) using single unit umbilical cord blood (UCB).

Secondary objectives are:

* Describe the clinical outcome of patients undergoing a double unit UCBT.
* Estimate the incidence and severity of acute and chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) of patients enrolled in the research arm.
* Estimate the incidence and time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment among patients enrolled in the research arm.
* Estimate the incidence of transplant related mortality (TRM) and transplant related morbidity in the first 100 days after transplantation among patients enrolled in the research

Exploratory Objectives are:

* Assess the relationship between pre-transplant minimal residual disease (MRD) with transplant outcomes.
* Record immune reconstitution parameters, including chimerism analysis, quantitative lymphocyte subsets, T cell receptor excision circle (TREC) and spectratyping. Immunophenotyping and functional assays of T, B and NK cells and lymphocytes will also be evaluated.
* Evaluate the determinants of engraftment.
