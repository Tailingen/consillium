Neoadjuvant Immunotherapy and Chemotherapy Followed by Surgery in Unresectable Stage Ⅲ NSCLC
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Camrelizumab in combination with platinum doublet neoadjuvant chemotherapy before surgery \[neoadjuvant phase\], followed by Camrelizumab alone after surgery \[adjuvant phase\] in participants with unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Carrelizumab|DRUG: Pemetrexed (Nonsquamous NSCLC) or Nab-paclitaxel(Squamous NSCLC)|DRUG: Carboplatin|PROCEDURE: Surgery
Major pathological response (MPR) rate, MPR rate is defined as the percentage of participants having ≤10% viable tumor cells in the resected primary tumor and all resected lymph nodes following completion of neoadjuvant therapy., 1 year
Resectability rate, Resectability rate is defined as the percentage of patients who were able to undergo surgery after neoadjuvant therapy., 1 year|Percentage of incidence of adverse Events, The incidences and types of adverse events that occur during neoadjuvant therapy and perioperative period (within postoperative 30 days and 90 days) will be evaluated according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0., approximately 16.5 months overall|PFS, Progression free survival, 2 year|OS, Overall survival, 2 year
Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is the recommended therapeutic approach for patients with unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC), although surgery offers the chance of cure. With combined radiation and chemotherapy, the prognosis of unresectable stage III NSCLC remains poor. Immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy has been shown to be efficacious as treatment for advanced non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without targetable genetic aberrations. Camrelizumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody against PD-1, has shown its efficacy in the treatment of advanced NSCLC. This study is to studying neoadjuvant camrelizumab plus double platinum based chemotherapy followed by surgery to see how well it works in treating patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC.
