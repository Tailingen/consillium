Use of a Remifentanil-propofol Mixture in Patients Undergoing Breast Cancer Surgery
Co-administration of propofol and remifentanil is considered to be an ideal total intravenous anesthesia technique, which is widely used in induction and maintenance of general anesthesia. Remifentanil and propofol can be mixed in polypropylene syringes for one hour with a remaining concentration of 91% in small concentrations of remifentanil. However, delivery of remifentanil-propofol mixture by target-controlled infusion(TCI) for general anesthesia in surgical procedure has not been described. Breast cancer surgery ( including modified radical mastectomy and breast-conserving surgery) is a less time-consuming procedure for patients with breast cancer with one-hour duration in our hospital. This pilot study was to examine the merit of remifentanil-propofol mixture as a GA regimen for breast cancer surgery.
