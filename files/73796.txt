RaPiDS- A Phase 2 Study of Anti-PD-1 Independently or in Combination With Anti-CTLA-4 in Second-Line Cervical Cancer
This is a randomized, blinded, non-comparative, two-arm Phase 2 clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of AGEN2034 administered with placebo (Treatment Arm 1 - monotherapy) or with AGEN1884 (Treatment Arm 2- combination therapy) for treatment of patients with advanced cervical cancer who relapsed or progressed after receiving first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. The study is not intended to compare the efficacy of the 2 experimental arms. Rather, the efficacy of each arm will be evaluated against its relevant historical controls as appropriate.
Cervical Cancer
DRUG: AGEN2034|DRUG: AGEN1884
Objective Response Rate, To assess the Objective Response Rate (ORR) to the treatment of AGEN2034 (anti-PD-1) administered with placebo (Treatment Arm 1 - monotherapy), or with AGEN1884 (anti-CTLA4) (Treatment Arm 2 - combination therapy), defined as the binomial proportion of intent to treat (ITT) patients with best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), in women with recurrent/persistent/metastatic cervical cancer who have progressed following first-line therapy. BOR will be determined by the Independent Radiology Review Committee (IRRC), according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1)., 48 months
Frequency, severity and duration of treatment-emergent AEs, To confirm the safety and tolerability of AGEN2034 administered with placebo (Treatment Arm 1 - monotherapy) or with AGEN1884 (Treatment Arm 2 - combination therapy) in patients with recurrent, progressive second-line cervical cancer., 48 months|DOR per RECIST 1.1, To assess duration of response (DOR), stable disease (SD), duration of stable disease and disease control rate (DCR), overall survival (OS), and progression-free survival (PFS) per RECIST 1.1 for AGEN2034 administered with placebo (Treatment Arm 1 - monotherapy) or with AGEN1884 (Treatment Arm 2 - combination therapy)., 48 months|Time to Confirmed Progression, To estimate the time to confirmed progression by the investigator per iRECIST for AGEN2034 administered with placebo (Treatment Arm 1 - monotherapy) or with AGEN1884 (Treatment Arm 2 - combination therapy)., 48 months|Immunogenicity of AGEN2034, To evaluate the immunogenicity of AGEN2034 administered with placebo (Treatment Arm 1 - monotherapy) or with AGEN1884 (Treatment Arm 2 - combination therapy) and to correlate it to exposure and biological activity., 48 months|Maximum observed drug concentration at steady state (Cmax-ss), To characterize AGEN2034 and AGEN1884 pharmacokinetics (PK)., 48 months|Minimum observed drug concentration at steady-state (Cmin-ss), To characterize AGEN2034 and AGEN1884 pharmacokinetics (PK)., 48 months|Area under the concentration-time curve within time span t1 to t2 at steady-state (AUC(τ1-τ2)-ss), To characterize AGEN2034 and AGEN1884 pharmacokinetics (PK)., 48 months|Area under the drug concentration-time curve from time zero to time t (AUC(0-t)), To characterize AGEN2034 and AGEN1884 pharmacokinetics (PK)., 48 months|Area under the drug concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC(0-∞)), To characterize AGEN2034 and AGEN1884 pharmacokinetics (PK)., 48 months|Time to maximum drug concentration (tmax), To characterize AGEN2034 and AGEN1884 pharmacokinetics (PK)., 48 months|Terminal disposition rate constant (λz), To characterize AGEN2034 and AGEN1884 pharmacokinetics (PK)., 48 months|Terminal elimination half-life (t1/2), To characterize AGEN2034 and AGEN1884 pharmacokinetics (PK)., 48 months|Systemic clearance (CL), To characterize AGEN2034 and AGEN1884 pharmacokinetics (PK)., 48 months|Volume of distribution (Vd), To characterize AGEN2034 and AGEN1884 pharmacokinetics (PK)., 48 months|Quality of Life Assessment per FACT-Cx, To assess quality of life in the treated population using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Cervical Cancer Trial Outcome Index (FACT-Cx), 35 months|Quality of Life Assessment per BPI, To assess quality of life in the treated population using Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), 35 months
This is a randomized, blinded, non-comparative, two-arm Phase 2 clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of AGEN2034 administered with placebo (Treatment Arm 1 - monotherapy) or with AGEN1884 (Treatment Arm 2- combination therapy) for treatment of patients with advanced cervical cancer who relapsed or progressed after receiving first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. The study is not intended to compare the efficacy of the 2 experimental arms. Rather, the efficacy of each arm will be evaluated against its relevant historical controls as appropriate Patients will receive AGEN2034 with placebo as a monotherapy or with AGEN1884 as combination therapy for a maximum of 24 months or until confirmed progression, unacceptable toxicity, or any criterion for stopping the study drug or withdrawal from the trial occurs. Placebo administration in Treatment Arm 1 (AGEN 2034 monotherapy) of the study is intended to preserve the integrity of the investigators' interpretation of the efficacy and safety data by eliminating biases in disease assessment monitoring, declaration of disease progression, and assessment of toxicities. Therefore, it is understood that investigators, patients, and research personnel will not know whether patients have received AGEN2034/placebo (Treatment Arm 1) or AGEN2034/AGEN1884 (Treatment Arm 2).

An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will evaluate safety and efficacy. An IRRC will be established to adjudicate tumor response.
