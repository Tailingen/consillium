IMPACT-AML: A Randomized Pragmatic Clinical Trial for Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia.
This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, pragmatic low intervention clinical trial comparing high intensity reinduction chemotherapy with low intensity therapies in 1st or 2nd relapse Acute Myeloid Leukemia. The study is funded by European Commission (HORIZON-MISS-2022-CANCER-01-03, Project ID 101104421)
Acute Myeloid Leukemia|Relapse/Recurrence
DRUG: High intensity therapies|DRUG: Low intensity therapies
To determine in R/R AML patients the clinical benefit of low intensity therapy as shown by event-free survival compared to high intensity therapy., Event-free survival defined as time from randomization to treatment failure, hematologic relapse from CR/CRh/Cri or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., 36 months
To determine if low intensity therapy improves overall survival, Overall survival, defined as time from randomization to the date of death from any cause., 36 months|To determine if low intensity therapy improves the overall response (Complete response (CR)/CR with partial hematologic recovery(CRh)/CR with incomplete hematologic recovery(CRi),morphologic leukemia-free state(MLFS)), Overall response rate (CR/CRh/CRi, MLFS) as the best assessment of response during the study treatment and the overall study cohort., 36 months|To determine if low intensity therapy improves patients-reported quality of life, Change in Hematologic Malignancy-Patient-Reported Outcome (HM-PRO) A-total as defined by the HM-PRO questionnaire between screening and end of treatment assessment., 36 months|To evaluate the safety of low intensity therapies as compared to high intensity therapies, Proportion of patients experiencing adverse events., 36 months
Thanks to recent advantages and results that demonstrate that low-intensity rescues may be quantitatively comparable to chemotherapy, novel personalized therapies are being slowly integrated into the treatment options of R/R AML. These new strategies, for the high interpatient variability, for the different cross-country reimbursement, for the school of thinking of treatment physicians, will wait decades to be proficiently compared with standard chemotherapy in the R/R setting, especially because most of the novel drugs are being pushed by the companies in the front-line (a setting that still has a large room for improvements). In IMPACT-AML RPCT, low-intensity therapies will be compared with high intensity chemotherapy rescue following a pragmatic, clinical-oriented approach.
