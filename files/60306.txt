Entia Liberty: Accuracy and Precision
This study forms part of Entia's clinical evidence for regulatory submission. This study evaluates Entia Liberty's performance claims with venous blood compared to the gold standard clinical laboratory haematology analysers. Excess blood flagged by the laboratory meeting our requirements will be tested on the Entia Liberty device and have its results compared against the laboratory results. Samples will also be flagged for precision testing (same blood sample, split into 10 Entia Liberty samples).
