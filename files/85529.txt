Real World Evidence Study on Metastatic Prostate Cancer in the Pirkanmaa Hospital District in Finland
Comprehensive understanding of the epidemiology and disease burden of metastatic prostate cancer patients in Finland is lacking. This study will address the following questions:

* What are the demographic and clinical characteristics of metastatic prostate cancer patients?
* How are metastatic prostate cancer patients currently treated and how effective are these treatments?
* How does the development of castration-resistance affect patient outcomes?
* What is the economic burden of metastatic prostate cancer?
