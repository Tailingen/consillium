Study of Radspherin® in Colorectal Carcinoma Subjects With Peritoneal Carcinomatosis Treated With HIPEC
This is a phase 1/2a open label study to evaluate the dose, safety, tolerability and efficacy of an IP α-emitting radionuclide therapy (Radspherin®) in subjects with peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) from colorectal carcinoma following complete CRS (cytoreduction score CC-0) and HIPEC.

The study consists of three different cohorts:

* Dose escalation cohorts
* Repeated injection cohorts
* Expansion cohort
Peritoneal Carcinoma|Colorectal Carcinoma
DRUG: Radspherin
Number of participants with Dose Limiting Toxicities as assessed by CTCAE v5.0., To investigate safety and toxicity of Radspherin®, 18 months|Maximum Tolerated Dose, To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of Radspherin®, among the four suggested doses 1, 2, 4 and 7 MBq, as a single intraperitoneal (IP) injection and two repeated IP injections following cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic IP chemotherapy (HIPEC), 21 Days|Explore efficacy (expansion cohort), Peritoneal recurrence free survival, 18 months
Primary objectives:

* To investigate safety and toxicity of Radspherin®
* To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of Radspherin®, among the four suggested doses 1, 2, 4 and 7 MBq, as a single intraperitoneal (IP) injection and two repeated IP injections following cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic IP chemotherapy (HIPEC)

Secondary objectives:

* To establish a recommended dose of Radspherin® as a single IP injection and two repeated IP injections following CRS and HIPEC
* To describe the biodistribution of Radspherin®
* To examine the efficacy and clinical benefit of Radspherin® following CRS and HIPEC

Exploratory objectives:

* To explore the association of biomarkers with activity/clinical benefits, adverse events (AEs), or other effects associated with Radspherin®
* To explore effects of catheter placement, Radspherin® administration technique, and infusion volume on the distribution of 224Ra labelled micro particles in the peritoneal cavity

The maximum number of subjects receiving Radspherin® in this study is 67. Subjects who discontinue prior to Radspherin® administration will be replaced.

Dose escalation cohorts: 3 - 24 subjects Repeated injection cohorts: 3 subjects Expansion cohort: up to 40 subjects
