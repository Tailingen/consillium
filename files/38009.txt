Effect of a Resilience Model-Based Care Plan in Newly Diagnosed Colorectal Cancer Patients
The aims of this three-year study are to explore the protective and risk factors of resilience in colorectal cancer patients, and examine the effect of the resilience model-based care plan in reducing fear of recurrence and GI symptom distress and improving quality of life in newly diagnosed colorectal cancer (CRC) patients.
