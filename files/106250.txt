End to End Anastomosis With Omega Suture Versus End to Anterior Rectal Wall In Colorectal Anastomosis in Sigmoid and Upper Rectal Cancer
The aim of this study is to compare end to end anastomosis with omega suture versus end to anterior rectal wall in colorectal anastomosis as regard post operative anastomotic leakage, bowel function, operative time and intra operative blood loss.

Colorectal cancer has been reported to be the 3rd most common and the second most deadly cancer world wide.

Anterior resection is the gold standard operation for both rectal and recto-sigmoid cancer with considering oncological safety maintenance to be the most important goal which can be achieved by keeping abundant resection margin and ensuring anastomotic safety, despite the technical difficulties of working in a narrow deep pelvis.

Understanding the characteristics of each anastomotic technique and establishing a stable anastomotic procedure both are pillars in anastomotic leakage prevention.

The intersection of the linear staple line and circular staple line in conventional anastomotic way is considered a risk factor for anastomotic leakage by creating stapled corners (called "dog-ears") which considered potentially ischemic and represent the area with high incidence of anastomotic leakage. Single stapled technique using ether end to end with omega suture or end to side stapled anastomosis allows avoidance of the formation of this intersection.
