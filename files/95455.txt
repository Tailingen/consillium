Suprapubic Versus Transurethral Catheterization After Rectal Resection With Low Anastomosis for Cancer in Males
The purpose of this study is to compare the urinary tract infection rate on the four postoperative day between the 2 groups of patients who have undergone total mesorectal excision for cancer and low anastomosis, with either suprapubic or transurethral catheterization.
Infection|Cancer
DEVICE: suprapubic catheterization|DEVICE: transurethral catheterization
Number of participants with urinary tract infection when using suprapubic versus transurethral catheterization as assessed by significant bacteriuria and pyuria, The urinary tract infection, defined as significant bacteriuria ( \> 104 CFU / mL) and pyuria (\> 6 white blood cells per high power field) in urine samples obtained immediately after removal of the urethral catheter or clamping suprapubic catheter and removing the fourth postoperative day., four days postoperative
Duration of catherism as assessed by the number of days for participants with the catheter and number of participants leaving the hospital with the catheter, 1 month|Pain as assessed by visual analogue scale (0 to 10 score) for abdomen and urethra, visual analogue scale (0-10) for both the abdomen and the urethra (a measure daily until hospital discharge ), at 1, 2, 3 and 4 days|Participants morbidity and mortality as assessed by Dindo and Clavien classification, at 1 month and 6 months|Rate of satisfaction for participants as assessed by questionnaries (Fact-C and EQ-5D-3L, Patient satisfaction : very, or moderately dissatisfied , unchanged , slightly , moderately , or very disappointed at the exit of the Fact- C hospital and EQ-5D - 3L at 30 days and 6 months., at 30 days and 6 months|Cost as assessed by the addition of the costs of the full process depending on the catheterism duration and additional consultations and readmissions for complications, Estimated cost of complications, urologic surgery, medication , hospitalization, additional consultations and readmissions., at 6 months|Duration of hospital stay in days, the hospital stay by day, within 6 months|Rate of recatheterization, in the first 6 months|Duration of postoperative return to normal bladder function as assessed by IPSS score, at 1 and 6 months|Number of additionnal consultations, in the first 6 months|Lack of comfort as assessed by visual analogue scale (0 to 10 score) for abdomen and urethra, visual analogue scale (0-10) for both the abdomen and the urethra (a measure daily until hospital discharge ), at 1, 2, 3 and 4 days|Specific complications, in the first 6 months
