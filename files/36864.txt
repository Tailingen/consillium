Genetic Characteristics of Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients
Genomic analysis for metastatic breast cancer(MBC) patients

* Participant (Inclusion criteria)

  1. Patients who diagnosed metastatic/stage IV breast cancer
  2. Patients who were not received treatment for metastatic breast cancer on palliative setting
* Process

  (1) Tissue/ Blood sample
* At diagnosis, MBC tissue / blood sample (20cc) will be obtained.
* At disease progression after 1st line treatment for MBC, blood sample (20cc) will be obtained (tissue; optional)

  (2) WES, RNASeq, ctDNA, Exosome
* We will analyze genomic characteritics using WES, RNASeq, ctDNA, Exosome.
