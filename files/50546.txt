Anamorelin Hydrochloride in Reducing Anorexia in Patients With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This phase II/III trial studies how well anamorelin hydrochloride works in reducing anorexia in patients with non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to other places in the body. Anamorelin hydrochloride may help to improve patients' appetite in order to stop weight loss.

To reach thematic saturation by qualitatively examining experiences related to anorexia at the baseline in advanced lung cancer patients with anorexia/cachexia receiving either oral Anamorelin 100 mg or placebo., A 60-90 minute interview will be conducted to identify and explore a range of issues, including: impact on daily psycho-social function (relationships, work, mood, initiative, pleasurable activities); food intake; independence; physiological changes in appetite/eating; visuality of cachexia; weight loss interpreted as a "bad sign"; response from health care professionals; conflict over food; coping responses; and the patient's report of meaningful change in symptoms due to the intervention (and if so, why)., Baseline up to day 64
Explore changes in anorexia/cachexia in patients with advanced non-small cell cancer after oral anamorelin 100 mg/placebo treatment, Measured by the Functional Assessment of Anorexia/Cachexia Treatment (FAACT) anorexia/cachexia subscale (A/CS). The FAACT A/CS domain is a 12-item symptom-specific domain designed to measure patients' additional concerns about their anorexia /cachexia during the previous 7 days on a scale of 0 to 4., Baseline up to day 64|Explore changes in anorexia after 9 weeks of oral Anamorelin 100 mg or placebo treatment, Measured by the A/CS. 5-item Anorexia Symptom Scale obtained by summing 5 anorexia symptom items derived from the FAACT A/CS domain measured by the following responses: "good appetite," "interest in food drops," "food tastes unpleasant," "get full quickly," and "difficulty eating rich/heavy foods"., Baseline up to day 64|Explore associations between changes in anorexia and body composition assessed with body weight in kilograms and (lean body mass in kilograms)., Body weight and height will be combined to report BMI in kg/m\^2, Baseline up to day 64|Explore associations between changes in anorexia with nutrition assessed by serum pre-albumin, Insulin Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1), and IGF binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3)., Measured by blood proteins to evaluate nutrition improvement related to loss of appetite and body weight loss., Baseline up to day 64|Explore associations between changes in anorexia with inflammation assessed by C-Reactive Protein (CRP), monocyte IL-6&R, TNF-Î±&R, IL-10,IL-8,IL-1&RA) inflammatory biomarkers., Measured by blood proteins (cytokines) to evaluate inflammation improvement related to loss of appetite and body weight loss., Baseline up to day 64|Explore associations between changes in anorexia with quality of life assessed by Functional Assessment of Cancer Illness Therapy (FACT-G), The FACT-G is a 27-item compilation of general questions divided into four primary domains: Physical Well-Being, Social/Family Well-Being, Emotional Well-Being, and Functional Well-Being. Answers rated from 0 meaning "Not at All" to 4 meaning "Very Much"., Baseline up to day 64|Explore any associations between changes in anorexia assessed by Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGIS) Scale, PGIS is a validated global impression scales used to evaluate subjective patients' response at the end of the intervention by assessing the severity and change in the symptom of interest. Determined by the participant's responses: Which of the following statements best describes your current appetite/eating-related symptoms? I currently do not have any appetite/eating-related symptoms I currently have minor appetite/eating-related symptoms I currently have moderate appetite/eating-related symptoms I currently have severe appetite/eating-related symptoms.., Baseline up to day 64|Explore any associations between changes in anorexia assessed by Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), PGIC is a validated global PGIC is a validated global impression scales used to evaluate subjective patients' response at the end of the intervention by assessing the severity and change in the symptom of interest using the following questions: "Since the start of the treatment, how would you describe your change in appetite/eating-related symptoms?" and "Since the start of treatment, how would you describe your change in your overall condition?" Determined by participant's responses ranging from "Very Much Improved" to "Very Much Worse"., Baseline up to day 64|Explore any associations between changes in anorexia with food intake after 9 weeks of oral Anamorelin 100 mg or placebo treatment, Participants will record their food and beverage intake at the time of consumption using MyFitnessPal., Baseline up to day 64
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To qualitatively examine experiences related to anorexia in advanced lung cancer patients with anorexia-cachexia and the impact of nine weeks of treatment of oral anamorelin hydrochloride (anamorelin) (100 mg) and placebo.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To explore changes in anorexia-cachexia (measured by the Functional Assessment of Anorexia/Cachexia Treatment \[FAACT\] anorexia/cachexia subscale \[A/CS\]) in patients with advanced non-small cell cancer after 9 weeks of oral anamorelin (100 mg) or placebo.

II. To explore changes in anorexia as measured by the 5-item Anorexia Symptom score (derived from the FAACT A/CS) after 9 weeks of oral anamorelin (100 mg) or placebo.

III. To explore any associations between changes in anorexia with body weight, body composition (as assessed by InBody, weight scale, and L3 vertebrae compute tomography \[CT\] scan), quality of life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Illness Therapy \[FACT-G\]), Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGIS), Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), nutritional markers (pre-albumin, IGF-1 and IGFBP-3), inflammatory biomarkers (C-reactive protein \[CRP\], monocyte IL-6\&R, TNF-a\&R, IL-10,IL-8, IL-1\&RA), and food intake after 9 weeks of oral anamorelin (100 mg) or placebo.

OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

ARM I: Patients receive anamorelin hydrochloride orally (PO) daily for 9 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unaccepted toxicity.

ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO daily for 9 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unaccepted toxicity.
