Phase 2 Study of Maintenance OSI-906 Plus Erlotinib (TarcevaÂ®), or Placebo Plus Erlotinib in Patients With Nonprogression Following 4 Cycles of Platinum-based Chemotherapy
A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study with a 1:1 randomization scheme.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) With Nonprogression Following 4 Cycles of Platinum-based Chemotherapy
DRUG: OSI-906|DRUG: erlotinib|DRUG: placebo
The Progression Free Survival (PFS) of maintenance OSI-906 plus erlotinib, or placebo plus erlotinib in patients with nonprogression following four cycles of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC in the overall population, PFS is defined as the time from randomization to disease progression based on RECIST v1.1 or death due to any cause whichever comes first, 22 months
Overall survival (OS), The time from the date of randomization until the documented date of death, 27 months|Disease control Rate (DCR), The proportion of patients with a best overall response of continued Complete Response (CR), CR, Partial Response (PR), OR Stable Disease (SD) based on RECIST criteria, 27 months|Best overall response rate (ORR), The proportion of patients with a best overall response of CR or PR based on RECIST criteria, 27 months|Response upgrade rate (RUR), The proportion of patients with a response upgrade, 27 months|Duration of response, The time from the date of the first documented response (CR/PR) to documented progression or death due to underlying cancer, 27 months|Safety assessed through physical examination, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiograms (ECG) and Adverse Events, 27 months
Adult patients with advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) and nonprogression after platinum-based chemotherapy will be randomized 1:1 to receive either OSI-906 plus erlotinib or placebo plus erlotinib.
