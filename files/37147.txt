Bendamustine in Patients With Refractory or Relapsed T-cell Lymphoma
A Phase II clinical study to determine the efficacy of single agent Bendamustine for T cell lymphoma "BENTLY".
T-cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Bendamustine
Determine the overall response rate (ORR) (CR+CRu+PR), 36 months follow-up
Evaluation of the tolerance and Safety of bendamustine in this subset of patients, 36 months follow-up|Determination of the progression free survival (PFS), time to treatment failure (TTF), time to progression (TTP), overall survival (OS) and the duration of response., 36 months follow-up
The primary objective of this study is to define the activity of Bendamustine for the treatment of T cells lymphomas. The activity of Bendamustine is determined by the response rate (RR) to the treatment within 22 days after intravenous infusion which enables to get a confidence interval of 95 % for the probability of an overall response rate (ORR).
