Evaluation of Long-term Immunogenicity and Safety of a Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccine in Healthy Female Subjects.
Infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) has been clearly established as the necessary cause of cervical cancer. This study is designed to evaluate the long-term immunogenicity and safety of the 580299 HPV vaccine up to 10 years after administration of the first dose of HPV vaccine (Month 0) administered in the primary study 580299/013. This protocol posting deals with objectives \& outcome measures of the extension phase from Month 60 to Month 120. The objectives \& outcome measures of the primary phase are presented in a separate protocol posting (NCT00196924). The objectives \& outcome measures of the extension phase up to Month 48 are presented in a separate protocol posting (NCT00316706).

PROCEDURE: Blood sampling
Number of Seroconverted Subjects With Anti-HPV-16/18 Antibody Titers Equal to or Above Cut-off Values., Anti-HPV-16 assay cut-off value was defined as 8 ELISA units per milliliter (EL.U/mL). Anti-HPV-18 assay cut-off value was defined as 7 EL.U/mL.

Seroconversion was defined as the appearance of antibodies (i.e. titer greater than or equal to the cut-off value) in the serum of subjects seronegative before vaccination.
