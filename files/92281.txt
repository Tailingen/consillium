A Phase IIII Study of AL8326 in Small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AL8326 tablets in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients with disease progression or recurrence after receiving at least second-line treatment regimens.
Small Cell Lung Carcinoma
DRUG: AL8326 tablets|DRUG: placebo
Overall survival (OS), The time between the date of randomization and the death of the subject from any cause., Cycle 1 Day 1 up to 3 years (each cycle is 28 days)
Progression-free survival (PFS), The period of time between the start of the subject's date of randomization and the first observation of disease progression (based on RECIST 1.1 criteria) or the occurrence of death due to any cause (the earlier of the two occurrences)., Cycle 1 Day 1 up to 12 months(each cycle is 28 days)|Objective remission rate (ORR), Proportion of subjects achieving CR and PR according to RECIST 1.1., 12 months|Duration of remission (DOR), Time from the start of the first assessment of the tumor as CR or PR to the first assessment of PD or death from any cause., 12 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Proportion of subjects achieving CR, PR, and SD., 12 months|Adverse Events (AEs), According to CTCAE V5.0, AES and abnormal indicators of laboratory tests need to be reported according to treatment group, category and worst grade., Cycle 1 Day 1 up to 12 months(each cycle is 28 days)|Plasma Concentration, Sparse PK samples (plasma concentration time data) of all subjects treated with study drug (AL8326 tablets / placebo) were collected for population pharmacokinetic analysis., Cycle 1 Day 1，Cycle 2 Day1（±3days），Cycle 4 Day 14（±3days）(each cycle is 28 days)
There are 2 treatment groups in this trial, and the study population, sample size and basic design of each group are:

Patients with pathologically confirmed small cell lung cancer at baseline and need = or \>3rd line treatment : the sample size was expected to be 243 cases, 162 in the active group and 81 in the control group.

Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio under double-blind conditions into two groups, with the active group receiving the trial drug AL8326 tablets and the control group receiving placebo. AL8326 tablets and placebo are administered as follows: oral administration, once daily for 28 days per cycle until intolerable toxicity or established disease progression or death or voluntary withdrawal or up to 12 months ( approximately 13 cycles) of treatment. Subjects will have a final visit, followed by a long-term follow-up period, and the tumor disease status will be determined according to RECIST 1.1.
