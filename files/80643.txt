Effect of Bladder Distension on Dosimetry in Brachytherapy of Cervical Cancer
The purpose of this study is to compare, for each patient, dosimetry of organs at risk (bladder, rectum, sigmoid, small bowel) in two bladder distension procedures (emptied by a urinary catheter or filled with 120cc) during PDR 3D image-guided brachytherapy of cervical cancer.
