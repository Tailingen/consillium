A Clinical Study of TQB3824 in Subjects With Advanced Cancer
TQB3824 blocks function of a specific protein called Cell Division Cycle 7 (CDC7) kinase in the human body, which plays important roles in the maintenance of DNA replication forks and DNA damage response pathways. This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of TQB3824.
Advanced Cancer
DRUG: TQB3824 tablets
Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), DLT describes side effects of a drug or other treatment that are serious enough to prevent an increase in dose or level of that treatment., up to 18 months|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), The maximum Dose at which less than 33% subjects experiencing DLT, up to 18 months|Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D), RP2D will be based on evaluation of clinical safety and tolerability and guided by accumulating PK data, up to 18 months
