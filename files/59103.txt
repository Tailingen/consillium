Darolutamide in Addition to ADT Versus ADT in Metastatic Hormone-sensitive Prostate Cancer
The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of darolutamide in combination with standard androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in patients with metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer.
Prostatic Neoplasms
DRUG: Darolutamide (Nubeqa, BAY1841788)|DRUG: Placebo|OTHER: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)
Radiological progression-free survival (rPFS), Time from the date of randomization to the date of first documentation of radiological progressive disease or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., 36 months
Overall survival (OS), Time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause., Up to 55 months|Time to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), Time from the date of randomization to the date of first castration resistant event (radiological progression, PSA progression or symptomatic skeletal events, whichever occurs first)., Up to 55 months|Time to initiation of subsequent anti-cancer therapy, Time from the date of randomization to initiation of first subsequent anti-cancer therapy for prostate cancer., Up to 55 months|Time to PSA progression, Time from the date of randomization to the date of first prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression. PSA progression is defined as a ≥25% increase above the nadir (lowest Screening or baseline) value, which is confirmed by a second value 3 or more weeks later, and an increase in absolute value of ≥ 2 ng/mL above nadir, at least 12 weeks from baseline., Up to 55 months|PSA undetectable rates (<0.2 ng/mL), The percentage of participants with detectable PSA values (≥0.2 ng/mL) at baseline which become undetectable (\<0.2 ng/mL) during the study treatment., Up to 55 months|Time to pain progression, Time from the date of randomization to pain progression, where progression is defined as an increase of 2 or more points from baseline. Pain to be assessed with a patient reported questionaire., Up to 55 months|Number of participants with adverse events as a measure of safety, Up to 55 months
