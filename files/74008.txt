3D Modeling of the Cervico-facial Region and Cranial Nerve Tractography: IMAG 2 ORL Project
3D modeling associated with the tracking of nerve fibers meets the needs of preoperative planning for tumors and cervico-facial congenital malformations. Indeed, these lesions are closely related to the cranial nerves and in particular nerve V (infratemporal fossa), nerve VII (temporal bone, parotido-masseter region), nerves IX, X, XI, XII and the chain cervical sympathetic (infratemporal and cervical regions). The development of a model of this region will therefore improve the surgical management of these children.

Children aged 1 to 5 benefiting from a 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at the Necker Enfants-Malades hospital for their care, meeting the inclusion criteria and participating in the study, will benefit during their MRI from the care, a sequence "Research" tractography MRI lasting 10 minutes. This sequence is already validated and proposed for tractography but in specialties other than pediatric ENT.

Tractography techniques are mathematical algorithms based on the diffusion tensor (micro-movements of water molecules in tissues) to reconstruct the path of nerve fibers in each volume unit of the MRI image (voxel).
