Uterine sarcoma accounts for less than 1% of gynecologic malignancies and 2% to 5%
of all uterine malignancies.[
1
]  The following  tumors arise primarily from three distinct
tissues:
Carcinosarcoma arises in the endometrium,  in other organs of mullerian origin, and accounts for 40% to 50% of all uterine sarcomas.
Leiomyosarcoma arises from myometrial muscle, with a peak incidence occurring at age 50 years, and accounts for 30% of all uterine sarcomas.
Sarcoma arises in the endometrial stroma, with a peak incidence occurring before menopause for the low-grade tumors and after menopause for the high-grade tumors. It accounts for 15% of all uterine sarcomas.
These three distinct entities are often grouped together as uterine sarcomas; however, each type of tumor is being studied in separate clinical trials.
Carcinosarcoma (the preferred designation by the World Health Organization [WHO]) is also referred to as mixed mesodermal sarcoma or mullerian tumor. Controversy exists about the following issues:
Whether carcinosarcoma is a true sarcoma.
Whether the sarcomatous elements are actually derived from a common epithelial-cell precursor that also gives rise to the usually more abundant adenocarcinomatous elements.
The stromal components of carcinosarcoma are further characterized by homologous elements, such as malignant mesenchymal tissue considered possibly native to the uterus, or heterologous elements, such as striated muscle, cartilage, or bone, which are foreign to the uterus. Carcinosarcoma parallels endometrial cancer in its postmenopausal predominance and in other epidemiological features. Increasingly, the treatment of carcinosarcoma is becoming similar to combined modality approaches for endometrial adenocarcinoma.
Other rare forms of uterine sarcoma also fall under the WHO classification for mesenchymal and mixed tumors of the uterus.  These sarcomas include the following:[
2
,
3
]
Mixed endometrial stromal and smooth muscle tumors.
Adenosarcomas, in which the epithelial elements appear benign within a malignant mesenchymal background.
Embryonal botryoides or rhabdomyosarcomas, which are found almost exclusively in infants.
PEComa—a perivascular epithelial-cell tumor that may behave in a malignant fashion, which is the latest to be added.
For more information, see
Childhood Rhabdomyosarcoma Treatment
.
Risk Factors
The only documented
etiological factor in 10% to 25% of these malignancies is prior pelvic radiation therapy,
which is often administered for benign uterine bleeding that began 5 to 25 years earlier.
An increased incidence of uterine sarcoma has been associated with tamoxifen in the treatment of breast cancer. Subsequently, increases have also been noted when tamoxifen  was given to prevent breast cancer in women at increased risk—a possible result of the estrogenic effect of tamoxifen on the uterus. Because of this increase, patients taking tamoxifen should have follow-up pelvic examinations and should undergo endometrial biopsy if there is any abnormal uterine bleeding.[

Prognosis
The prognosis for women with uterine sarcoma primarily depends on the extent of
disease at the time of diagnosis.[
7
] For women with carcinosarcoma, significant
predictors of metastatic disease at initial surgery include:[
7
]
Isthmic or cervical location.
Lymphatic vascular space invasion.
Serous and clear cell histology.
Grade 2 or 3 carcinoma.
These factors, in addition to the following ones, correlate with a progression-free interval:[
7
]
Adnexal spread.
Lymph node metastases.
Tumor size.
Peritoneal cytologic
findings.
Depth of myometrial invasion.
Factors that bear no relationship to the presence or absence of metastases at surgical exploration include:
Presence or absence of stromal heterologous elements.
Types of such elements.
Grade of the stromal components.
Mitotic
activity of the stromal components.
In one study, women
with well-differentiated sarcomatous components or carcinosarcomas had
significantly longer progression-free intervals than those with moderately to
poorly differentiated sarcomas for the homologous and heterologous types. 
The recurrence rate was 44% for homologous tumors and 63% for heterologous
tumors.  The type of heterologous sarcoma had no effect on the progression-free
interval.
For women with leiomyosarcomas, some investigators consider tumor size to be the most
important prognostic factor. Women with tumors larger than 5.0 cm in maximum
diameter have a poor prognosis.[
8
]  However, in a Gynecologic Oncology Group
study, the mitotic index was the only factor significantly related to
progression-free interval.[
7
]  Leiomyosarcomas matched for other known
prognostic factors may be more aggressive than their carcinosarcoma 
counterparts.[
9
]  The 5-year survival rate for women with stage I disease, which is 
confined to the corpus, is approximately 50% versus 0% to 20% for the remaining
stages.
Surgery alone can be curative if the malignancy is contained within the uterus. 
The value of pelvic radiation therapy is not established.  Current studies consist
primarily of phase II chemotherapy trials for patients with advanced disease.  Adjuvant
chemotherapy following complete resection  for patients with stage I or II disease was not found to be effective in a randomized trial.[
10
]  Yet, nonrandomized
trials have reported improved survival following adjuvant chemotherapy with or
without radiation therapy.[

Cellular Classification of Uterine Sarcoma
The most common histological types of uterine sarcomas include:
Carcinosarcoma (mixed
mesodermal sarcoma [40%–50%]).
Leiomyosarcoma (30%).
Endometrial stromal
sarcoma (15%).
The uterine neoplasm classification of the International Society of
Gynecologic Pathologists and the World Health Organization uses the term
carcinosarcoma
for all primary uterine
neoplasms containing malignant elements of both epithelial and stromal light
microscopic appearances, regardless of whether malignant heterologous
elements are present.[

FIGO Staging
FIGO Staging
The Fédération Internationale de Gynécologie et d’Obstétrique (FIGO) and the American Joint Committee on Cancer have designated staging to define uterine
sarcoma; the FIGO system is most commonly used.[
1
,

]
The FIGO staging system has two divisions, one for
leiomyosarcoma and endometrial stromal sarcoma, and one for
adenosarcoma. Carcinosarcoma is staged using the designated endometrial
carcinoma definitions. For more information, see

Treatment Option Overview for Uterine Sarcoma
Surgery is often the principal means of diagnosis and is the primary treatment for all patients with uterine sarcoma. If the diagnosis is known, the extent of surgery is planned according to the stage of the tumor.  Hysterectomy is usually performed when a uterine malignancy is suspected, except for rare instances when preservation of the uterus in a young patient is deemed safe for the type of cancer (e.g., a totally confined low-grade leiomyosarcoma in a woman who desires to retain childbearing potential).  Medically suitable patients with the preoperative diagnosis of uterine sarcoma
are considered candidates for abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy, and pelvic and periaortic selective lymphadenectomy. 
Cytologic washings are obtained from the pelvis and abdomen.  Thorough
examination of the diaphragm, omentum, and upper abdomen is performed.
There is no firm evidence from a prospective study that adjuvant chemotherapy
or radiation therapy is of benefit for patients with uterine sarcoma.[
1
] 
In one Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) study, the use of adjuvant doxorubicin did not alter the survival rate of patients with resected stage I or stage II uterine sarcomas; however, interpretation of these results is difficult because this study included some patients who received radiation and three types of uterine sarcomas that have variable responses to doxorubicin.[
1
][
Level of evidence A1
] Because the risk of disease recurrence is high, even with localized
presentations, many physicians have considered the use of adjuvant chemotherapy
or radiation therapy.[

]
Another GOG   study  (
GOG-0150
[NCT00002546]) addressed radiation therapy versus adjuvant chemotherapy.[

used 3-day ifosfamide regimens (instead of the more toxic 5-day regimen in the preceding study) given alone or in combination with paclitaxel (with filgrastim starting on day 4).[
5
] The combination was superior in response rates (45% vs. 29%), PFS (8.4 months vs. 5.8 months), and overall survival (13.5 months vs. 8.4 months). The hazard ratio for death favored the combination (0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.49–0.97).[

[NCT00003128] used 3-day ifosfamide regimens (instead of the more toxic 5-day regimen in the preceding study) given alone or in combination with paclitaxel (with filgrastim starting on day 4).[

] The combination was superior in response rates (45% vs. 29%), PFS (8.4 months vs. 5.8 months), and overall survival (13.5 months vs. 8.4 months). The hazard ratio for death favored the combination (0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.49–0.97).[

Level of evidence A1
] In this study, 52% of 179 evaluable patients had recurrent disease, 18% had stage III disease, and 30% had stage IV disease.  In addition, imbalances were present in the sites of disease and in the use of prior radiation therapy, and 30 patients were excluded for wrong pathology.
Radiation therapy may be an effective
method of palliative care for patients with carcinosarcoma who have localized recurrence in the pelvis
confirmed by computed tomography.  Phase I and II clinical trials are appropriate for patients who
have disease recurrence with distant metastasis and are unresponsive to first-line phase II
trials.  High-dose progesterone hormone therapy may be of some benefit to
patients with low-grade stromal sarcoma.[
