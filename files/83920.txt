Evaluation of a New Radiotracer (64Cu-DOTA-AE105) for Diagnosing Aggressive Cancer With Positron Emission Tomography
The primary objective of the study is to test a new radiotracer called 64Cu-DOTA-AE105 for PET imaging of uPAR (urokinase plasminogen activator receptor). The tracer has the potential of identifying the invasive cancer phenotype, thereby distinguishing between aggressive and less aggressive tumors. This is a first in human study to test the radiotracer in cancer patients. The biodistribution and tumor uptake will be evaluated by repeated PET imaging (1,3 and 24 hours post injection).

OTHER: Injection of 64Cu-DOTA-AE105
Biodistribution, The patients will be PET scanned 1, 3 and 24 hours post injection of the radiotracer 64Cu-DOTA-AE105. These different timepoints will be used for assessment of biodistribution, 24 hours|Dosimetry, The patients will be PET scanned 1, 3 and 24 hours post injection of the radiotracer 64Cu-DOTA-AE105. These different timepoints will be used for calculation of dosimetry, 24 hours
Expression of UPAR in tumor tissue, Tumor uptake of 64Cu-DOTA-AE105 will be compared with expression of uPAR (using immunohistochemistry and ELISA) in tumor tissue obtained from biopsies/or operative removal of the tumors., 24 hours|Quantitative uptake of UPAR in tumor tissue, The patients will be PET scanned 1, 3 and 24 hours post injection of the radiotracer 64Cu-DOTA-AE105. These different timepoints will be used for assessment of tumor uptake of 64Cu-DOTA-AE105 will be assessed by PET scans 1, 3 and 24 hours post injection, 24 hours

The primary end points are Biodistribution and dosimetry of 64Cu-DOTA-AE105. In addition, the quantitative uptake of 64Cu-DOTA-AE105 in tumors and expression of uPAR in tumor tissue obtained by surgery or biopsies (either 14 days before (only biopsies) or after the PET scans) will be compared to validate the image-derived data on UPAR expression
