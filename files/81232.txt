Salvage Surgery for Patients With Metastatic GIST With Rego
Some researches have shown surgery may acquire progression-free (PFS) benefit for selected patients with metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) who received first-line imatinib and second-line sunitinib. However, impact of salvage surgery on pre-treated GIST patients receiving third-line regorafenib facing progression is not yet reported. Investigators retrospectively reviewed patients with regorafenib treatment with salvage surgery.

Between 2014 and 2019, 41 metastatic GIST patients received regorafenib therapy. 35 out of 41 metastatic GIST patients who were on regorafenib therapy facing progression and 15 experienced local progression underwent salvage surgery. Thirty-five of 41 (85.4 %) pre-treated GIST patients receiving regorafenib who experienced disease progression after a median follow-up of 12.4 months of regorafenib use. 15 out of 35 (42.9%) metastatic GIST patients receiving regorafenib facing progression underwent salvage surgery.
