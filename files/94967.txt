Chloroquine in Combination With VELCADE and Cyclophosphamide for Relapsed and Refractory Multiple Myeloma
This pilot phase II trial studies how well giving bortezomib and cyclophosphamide together with chloroquine works in treating patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Velcade|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Chloroquine
Response Rate (CR + PR After 2 Cycles), Response rate is defined as the percentage of patients who have a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). Responses were assessed every two cycles of treatment, based on the criteria published by the International Myeloma Working Group (Durie, et al, 2006). Per International Myeloma Working Group response criteria:

CR: Negative immunofixation on the serum and urine and disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas and \< 5% plasma cells in bone marrow PR: \> 50% reduction of serum M-protein and reduction in 24 hours urinary M-protein by \>90% or to \< 200 mg/24 h, Up to 2 years
Number of Participants With Adverse Events of Grade 3 or Higher, Adverse events reported here were at least possibly related to the protocol therapy., Treatment period plus 30 days post-treatment|Percentage of Subjects Who Have Complete Response or Partial Response and Have 2+ or Higher Autophagy, until clinical response (up to 2 years)|Median Duration of Response of This Regimen, Duration of response is the time from response (CR or PR) until progression of disease or relapse. Responses and progression were evaluated based on the criteria published by the International Myeloma Working Group (Durie, et al, 2006)., up to 2 years
Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Chloroquine may help chemotherapy drugs work better by making cancer cells more sensitive to the drug. Giving bortezomib and cyclophosphamide together with chloroquine may kill more cancer cells.
