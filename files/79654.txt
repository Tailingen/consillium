A Multi - Center Study Of PET Imaging With [F-18] FLT & [F-18] FDG in Cancer Patients for Treatment Evaluation
Approximately 60 patients will be enrolled with highly suspected lung cancer, or head and neck cancer. The patients must also be starting radiotherapy or a chemoradiotherapy regimen (except with 5-fluorouracil). The patients will undergo 3 visits. One screening, one pre therapy PET/CT imaging visit, and one (3-5 weeks after the start of therapy) post PET/CT imaging visit. This study will evaluate the FLT and FDG images for tumor proliferation rates for early assessment of tumor response to radiation or chemo-radiation combo.

DRUG: [F-18]FLT
[F-18]FLT PET Scan for Early Assessment of Tumor Response to Radiation or Chemoradiotherapy Compared to [F-18] FDG PET Scan, The sponsor decided not to further develop \[F-18\]FLT. Therefore, no further analysis was performed., 3-5 weeks after the start of radiation or chemo radio therapy
PHASE: II/III

OBJECTIVES:

Primary: To investigate the clinical value of serial quantitative \[F-18\] FLT positron image assessment of tumor proliferation rates for early assessment of tumor response to radiation or chemoradiotherapy regimens (except with 5-fluorouracil) in comparison to serial quantitative \[F-18\] FDG images

Secondary: To gain additional clinical information and experience with \[F-18\]FLT to guide the design of a future, pivotal, Phase III trial where changes in tumor proliferation from pre-treatment baseline values can be used as a early indicator of response to therapy regimens.

DESIGN: Open label, nonrandomized, uncontrolled, single group assignment

DURATION: Pre treatment \[F-18\] FLT PET scan following a clinical \[F-18\] FDG PET scan followed by post treatment \[F-18\] FLT PET scan and a post treatment, clinical \[F-18\] FDG PET scan at 4 weeks (Â±1 week) to monitor radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy.

PROCEDURES: Informed consent, collection of demographic information, medical history, physical examinations, vital signs, 12-lead ECGs, concomitant medication collection, monitor adverse events, pre treatment \[F-18\] FLT PET scan and post treatment \[F-18\] FLT PET scan

SUBJECTS: Approximately 60 patients will be enrolled with confirmed lung cancer, or head and neck cancer. The patients must also be starting radiotherapy or a chemoradiotherapy regimen (except with 5-fluorouracil) to be eligible. This allows for approximately 40 evaluable patients to complete this study at approximately four to eight sites and conducted in the United States.
