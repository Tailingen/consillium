Candonilimab (AK104) Plus Preoperative Chemotherapy for Locally Advanced Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (ESCC)
This is a prospective, single-arm, open-label，multi-center, phase II study, aiming to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AK104 combined with preoperative chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced ESCC.
Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: AK104, nab-paclitaxel, carboplatin
pCR, Pathological complete response, up to 2 years
MPR, Major pathologic response, up to 2 years|R0 resection rate, R0 resection rate, up to 2 years|Downstaging rate, Downstaging rate, up to 2 years|DFS, Disease-free survival, up to 2 years|OS, Overall survival, up to 2 years|AE, Adverse event, up to 2 years
Eligible patients first receive AK104 (10mg/kg, iv, Q2W) for one cycle in the induction period, and then patients receive AK104 (10mg/kg, iv, Q3W) combined with nab-paclitaxel (130mg/m2 ivgtt d1，d8, Q3W) and carboplatin ((AUC=5) d1，Q3W) for 2 cycles. After neoadjuvant therapy of 3 cycles, patient will undergo preoperative evaluation. For patients who can be performed for R0 surgery, surgery wil be performed in 4 to 6 weeks. Patients who do not achieve Pathological complete response (pCR) will receive AK104 (10mg/kg, iv, Q3W) as adjuvant therapy until disease progression or intolerable toxicity for up to 12 months. Patients who achieve pCR after surgery will be enrolled in observational follow-up.
