A Study of JNJ-78278343 in Combination With Either JNJ-63723283 (Cetrelimab), Taxane Chemotherapy, or Androgen Receptor Pathway Inhibitors for Metastatic Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to identify the recommended phase 2 regimen(s) RP2R(s) of JNJ-78278343 and combination agent in Part 1 (dose escalation) and to determine safety at the putative RP2R(s) of JNJ-78278343 with the combination agent in Part 2 (dose expansion).
Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Neoplasms
DRUG: JNJ-78278343|DRUG: Cetrelimab|DRUG: Cabazitaxel|DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Apalutamide|DRUG: Enzalutamide|DRUG: Darolutamide|DRUG: Abiraterone acetate plus prednisone (AAP)
Part 1: Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), DLTs are specific adverse events and are defined as any of the following: high grade non-hematologic toxicity or hematologic toxicity., Up to 21 days after first dose of combination agent|Part 1 and Part 2: Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) by Severity, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant participating in a clinical study that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the pharmaceutical/biological agent under study. Severity will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 5.0 with the exception of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome events, which will be graded by American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) guidelines. Severity scale ranges from grade 1 (mild) to grade 5 (death). Grade 1= mild, Grade 2= moderate, Grade 3= severe, Grade 4= life-threatening and Grade 5= death related to adverse event., Up to 2 years 11 months
Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who have a partial response (PR) or better without evidence of bone progression according to Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria., Up to 2 years 11 months|Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Response Rate, PSA response rate is defined as the percentage of participants with a confirmed decline of PSA of 50 percent (%) or more from baseline., Up to 2 years 11 months|Radiographic Progression-free Survival (rPFS), rPFS is defined time from the date of first dose of JNJ-78278343 until the date of objective disease progression or death, whichever comes first., Up to 2 years 11 months|Time to Response (TTR), TTR is defined for the responders as the time from the date of first dose of to the date of first documented response that is subsequently confirmed., Up to 2 years 11 months|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined for participants who achieved response (PR or better) as the time between the date of initial documentation of response (PR or better) to the date of first documented evidence of progressive disease, as defined in the PCWG3, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 2 years 11 months
The purpose of this study is to identify the recommended phase 2 regimen(s) RP2R(s) of JNJ-78278343 and combination agent in Part 1 (dose escalation) and to determine safety at the putative RP2R(s) of JNJ-78278343 with the combination agent in Part 2 (dose expansion).
