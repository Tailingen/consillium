Molecular Profiling in Small Cell Lung Cancer
This protocol is to obtain tumor tissues and blood samples from patients with a confirmed histological diagnosis of Small cell lung cancer(SCLC) for molecular profiling.

Overall survival(OS), OS is defined as time duration from randomization until the date of death from any cause. If the participants who had survived after the end of the study, or loss of follow-up, their last time of contact is defined as a deadline., Five years
Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as time duration from randomization until the date of SD(Stable Disease) or PD(Progressed Disease) evaluated by WHO RECIST (World Health Organization Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumorsï¼Œ Edition1.1)., Five years
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is most invasive subtypes of lung cancer. After diagnosis, the SCLC patients without treatment often die in 2-4 months. SCLC is a highly heterogeneous malignant tumor, the previous treatment principle of the tumor is based on the traditional histopathology, which not provide accurate guidance for precise treatment. In recent years, breakthrough has been made in molecular classification of breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, gastrointestinal cancer and of the other tumor, but SCLC molecular classification has not yet reported.

In this prospective study, SCLC tissues and blood samples from extensive SCLC patients will be obtained and evaluated of molecular profiling. Eligible population includes: patients who have not undergone any treatment and diagnosed of extensive SCLC by immunohistochemistry(IHC). The purpose is to evaluate molecular profiling of SCLC patients who are sensitive or resistant to chemotherapy (Cisplatin+Etoposide). To compare molecular alterations of SCLC patients with different prognosis (Overall Survival, Progress Free Survival).
