Nivolumab and Bevacizumab in Patients With Advanced and or Metastatic Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This is an open label, phase I study to test for maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of the combination of nivolumab and bevacizumab. The study will use a 3+3 phase I study design using a fixed dose of nivolumab (240mg) and escalating doses of bevacizumab (1-10mg).

Adverse Events that occur, Investigate the safety and tolerability of 14-day cycles of nivolumab plus bevacizumab.

Adverse events will be collected for each subject that received the study treatment combination., Every 14 day cycle for up to 2 years - Patients are expected to be on treatment for an average of 6 months|Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).

Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT) will define subsequent subject accrual and dose escalation, The DLT period will begin at Cycle 1 Day 1 and continue through Cycle 1 Day 28 for each patient
Progression Free Survival (PFS), To examine the effect of the study treatment combination on the rate of progression-free survival (PFS).

Subjects will have regular imaging scans to measure disease status and response will be defined by RECIST1.1., 3 years after treatment stops|Overall Survival, To examine the effect of the study treatment combination on the rate of overall survival., 3 years after treatment stops
