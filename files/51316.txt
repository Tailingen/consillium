Total Xenoestrogen Body Burden in Relation to Mammographic Density, a Marker of Breast Cancer Rlisk
Mammographic density is sensitive to estorgen exposure and constitutes a strong intermediate maker of breast cancer risk. We hypothesize that women with higher serum xenoestrogen levels will have greater mammographic density.
