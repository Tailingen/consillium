Pattern of Use and Safety/Effectiveness of Nivolumab in Routine Oncology Practice
This is an observational, multicenter study in participants treated with nivolumab for the approved indications of melanoma and Lung cancer in Australia, the EU, Switzerland, the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States (US). The targeted countries in the EU for study participation include Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland, and Spain. Study objectives are to assess the safety experience, survival, adverse event management, and outcomes of adverse events associated with nivolumab in routine oncology care facilities.
