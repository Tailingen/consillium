HyBryte (Synthetic Hypericin) Versus Valchlor (Mechlorethamine) in the Treatment of CTCL
The objective of this clinical study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of Valchlor versus HyBryte following 12 weeks of treatment.
Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma/Mycosis Fungoides
DRUG: Hypericin|DRUG: Mechlorethamine Topical Gel
Number of Participants with a Treatment Response in the Modified Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Disease Severity (mCAILS) score, A treatment response is defined as a â‰¥50% improvement in mCAILS score at Week 12 when compared to the mCAILS score at baseline.

The Modified Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Disease Severity (mCAILS) score measures: Erythema (or redness) on a scale of 0 (no redness) to 8 (very red), Scaling on a scale of 0 (no scaling) to 8 (all of the lesion is covered by a very rough surface), Plaque Elevation on a scale of 0 (no evidence of plaque above normal skin level) to 3 (plaque shows marked elevation above normal skin level) and Surface Area on a scale of 0 (no lesion/surface area is 0 cm\^2) to 18 (the lesion is larger than 300 cm\^2). A lower score means a better outcome., 12 weeks
Participants will be randomized to receive HyBryte or Valchlor in a 1:1 randomization. Participants will be treated for 12 weeks and follow-up visits will be conducted 1, 2, and 4 weeks after completion of the treatment phase of the trial.

Prior to randomization, each participant will have at least 3 and up to 5 lesions identified (index lesions) that will be evaluated during the treatment phase and during the follow-up visits.
