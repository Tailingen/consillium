Study of the Efficacy of Local Analgesia as an Adjunct to General Anesthesia in Thyroidectomy and Parathyroidectomy
We aim to study the effect of local anesthetic when used in conjunction with general anesthesia during thyroidectomy or parathyroidectomy. We hypothesize there is equivalent pain control between bilateral superficial cervical plexus block and local wound infiltration when used in conjunction with a general anesthetic.

PROCEDURE: Superficial Cervical Plexus Block|PROCEDURE: Local Wound Infiltration|DRUG: 0.9% saline|DRUG: Marcaine
Intraoperative Fentanyl Administration, The total amount of Fentanyl administered during the procedure will be recorded., During the procedure
Post Operative Pain, Pain scores will either be verbally reported to nursing and recorded or reported on a questionnaire. Back of neck pain scores range 0-10, throat pain scores range 0-9, incisional pain scores range 0-9 (zero means no pain and 9 or 10 means severe pain)., At four hour after operation|Post Operative Nausea Score, Nausea scores will either be verbally reported to nursing and recorded or reported on a questionnaire. The scores range 0-9 (zero means no symptom and 9 means "very severe")., At 2 weeks after operation|Total Pain Medication Utilization, Total operative opioid dosages administered converted to effective mg of Hydromorphine., At follow up appointment 1-2 weeks postoperatively
