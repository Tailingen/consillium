Phase 1b/2 Study of Rogaratinib (BAY1163877) in Combination With Atezolizumab in Urothelial Carcinoma
FORT-2 is designed to evaluate safety, efficacy, RP2D and PK of rogaratinib in combination with atezolizumab in patients with untreated FGFR-positive urothelial carcinoma. The study originally comprised two separate parts: Phase 1b (Part A) and Phase 2 (Part B). The study parts differ in design, objectives, and treatment.

The primary objectives of this Phase 1b study (Part A) are to determine the safety, tolerability, RP2D and pharmacokinetics of rogaratinib in combination with atezolizumab in these patients.

The primary objective of the Part B is to compare progression-free survival (PFS) according to RECIST v1.1 of rogaratinib in combination with atezolizumab over placebo in combination with atezolizumab in untreated patients with FGFR-positive locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma.

Of note, patients who participate in Part A are not allowed to participate in Part B.

Part B will be initiated once the data from Part A supports continuation of the study, even if this occurs prior to primary completion of Part A. The sponsor may decide not to continue the study as a whole after completion of Part A if the data do not support further development.

Part B of the study will no longer be conducted.
Urothelial Carcinoma
DRUG: Rogaratinib (BAY1163877)|DRUG: Atezolizumab
Number of Participants With Dose-limiting Toxicities(DLTs), Up to 21 days|Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), up to 90 days after the last study medication intake, an average of 60 days|Number of Participants With Drug-related TEAEs, up to 90 days after the last study medication intake, an average of 60 days|Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Serious Adverse Events(TESAEs), up to 90 days after the last study medication intake, an average of 60 days
Objective Response Rate(ORR), Objective response rate (ORR) was defined as the percentage of patients with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). Patients for whom best overall tumor response was not CR or PR, as well as patients without any post-baseline tumor assessment were considered non-responders. For all patients, the best overall tumor response was determined locally by investigators using the RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors) criteria. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., Up to 5 months|Maximal Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of Rogaratinib, At cycle 1 Day 1|Area Under the Rogaratinib Concentration Versus Time Curve (AUC), At cycle 1 Day 1, 0-t(last)
