The Effects of Curcuminoids on Aberrant Crypt Foci in the Human Colon
The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of curcumin in reducing the number of aberrant crypt foci (ACF) in the colon.
Aberrant Crypt Foci
DRUG: sulindac|DRUG: curcumin
To evaluate the effects of curcumin or the NSAID sulindac on the number of ACF in the left colon and rectum of normal volunteers found to have them on an initial magnifying chromoendoscopic screening exam, 48 months
To determine the turnover (proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation) of colorectal epithelial cells in the crypts in situ in response to each treatment, 48 months
Laboratory studies have indicated that this agent, which is derived from plants and found in foods we eat, has anti-inflammatory properties and prevents colon cancer in animal studies. ACFs are small abnormalities in the lining of the colon that with time may grow into colorectal adenomas (also called polyps, growths or small masses of tissue on the lining of the colon or rectum which have the potential to become cancerous) which can then grow into adenocarcinomas (cancer) in the colon or rectum.
