Phase 2, Open-label, Single-arm Study on the Use of Metformin as Adjunctive Therapy in High-grade Glioma
About 75% of CNS malignant tumors are classified as gliomas and the IDH-wildtype glioblastoma (GBM) represents the most aggressive form among CNS malignancies.

This is a nationwide single-center phase II drug clinical trial with an approximate duration of 32 months.

The clinical trial will be single-arm to evaluate the biological activity and effects of metformin in combination with TMZ in patients with GBM.

DRUG: Metformin
Value of PFS at 6 months after the start of treatment, It allow us to determine the efficacy at the recommended dose (RD) of metformin in patients with GBM, Frome baseline to 6 months
EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire at 6 months after the start of treatment, The Quality of Life of Cancer Patients questionnaire allow us to evaluate the change in the level of health-related quality of life.

It consists of several questions that the patient must answer by choosing a value from 1 (minimum) to 4/7 (maximum), depending on the question., Frome baseline to 6 months|MMSE questionnaire at 6 months after the start of treatment, The Mini Mental State Evaluation questionnaire allow us to evaluate the change in the level of health-related quality of life.

It consists of several questions for the patient to answer, but there are no minimum or maximum values for the patient to choose from., Frome baseline to 6 months|Safety and tolerability assessment of treatment, Safety will be assessed throughout the study as type, frequency and severity of grade III and IV events.

Tolerability will be assessed as number of discontinuations or dose reduction and by evaluation of clinical and hematochemical parameters, From baseline through study completion, an average of 32 months|Plasma measurement of circulating metabolites, Peri-operative plasma will be taken from each patient for hematochemical analysis, in order to research of prognostic biomarkers., At study completion, an average of 32 months|Plasma measurement of adiponectin, Peri-operative plasma will be taken from each patient for hematochemical analysis, in order to research of prognostic biomarkers., At study completion, an average of 32 months|Proteomic analysis, Peri-operative plasma will be taken from each patient for proteomic analysis, in order to research of prognostic biomarkers., At study completion, an average of 32 months|Correlations between in vivo clinical response and effect of association measured in vitro on cell lines obtained from the same patient undergoing surgery, In vitro cell response measured as cell growth inhibition and correlation with clinical response (PFS) of the same patient., At the end of recruitment, an average of 18 months|Gene expression analysis, Identifying the molecular phenotype of cells taken from patients' tissue samples during surgery and comparing clinical response and molecular phenotype by transcriptomic analysis, At the end of recruitment, an average of 18 months
About 75% of CNS malignant tumors are classified as gliomas, tumors of neuroectodermal origin arising from glial cells or glial cell precursors. The World Health Organization classification distinguishes gliomas into low-grade gliomas (low-grade gliomas, grade I and II) and high-grade gliomas (high-grade gliomas, grade III and IV).

IDH-wildtype glioblastoma (GBM) represents the most aggressive form among CNS malignancies.

Over the past century, numerous epidemiological and experimental observations have reported a preventive and beneficial antitumor effect of metformin, which has suggested the possibility of using it as adjunctive therapy in many cancer subtypes, including GBM.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of Metformin as adjuvant therapy to TMZ in the treatment of patients with GBM.

Patients will start with a Metformin dose of 1 g/day orally in two administrations (500 mg tablets) during the first two weeks of treatment, increasing to 2 g/day in two 1 g tablets thereafter.

The approximate total duration of the study is 32 months, and 25 patients will be enrolled
