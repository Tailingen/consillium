Intrapatient Comparison of Urinary Radioactivity Following Piflufolastat (18F) and Flotufolastat (18F) PET in Men With Low PSA Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer Following Radical Prostatectomy
Intrapatient Comparison of Urinary Radioactivity Following Piflufolastat (18F) and Flotufolastat (18F) PET in Men with Low PSA Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer Following Radical Prostatectomy
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Flotufolastat (18F)|DRUG: piflufolastat (18F)
To compare urinary bladder radioactivity observed on piflufolastat (18F) PET and flotufolastat (18F) PET., Difference in urinary bladder mean SUV (SUVmean) between piflufolastat (18F) and flotufolastat (18F)., Screening, piflufolastat (18F) on Day 1, At least 24 hours after the piflufolastat (18F) scan, but within 10 calendar days
To assess the following for piflufolastat (18F) PET and flotufolastat (18F) PET: Detection rates; Detection rates stratified by PSA level; Prostate bed detection rates: local recurrences by subregion; Pelvic lymph node (PLN) detection rates, Estimate of the following for each radiopharmaceutical: Patient-level detection rate; Patient-level detection rate by baseline PSA categories; Detection rate for local recurrences in prostate bed for the following subregions: vesicourethral anastomosis lesions; retrovesical lesions; remnant seminal vesicles/lateral surgical margin lesions; Detection rate for PLN lesions., Screening, piflufolastat (18F) on Day 1, At least 24 hours after the piflufolastat (18F) scan, but within 10 calendar days
This is a multi-center, prospective intra-patient comparator study of urinary radioactivity (standardized uptake values \[SUV\]) following both piflufolastat (18F) and flotufolastat (18F) positron emission tomography (PET) in patients with low prostate-specific antigen (PSA; â‰¤0.5 ng/mL) biochemical recurrence (BCR) of prostate cancer following radical prostatectomy (RP).
