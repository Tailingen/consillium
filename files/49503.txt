The EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire is designed for use with a wide range of cancer patient populations and is intended to be supplemented by tumour-specific questionnaire modules. The EORTC QLQ-C30 incorporates different multi-item scales, i.e. functional scales, symptom scales and a Global Health Status/QoL scale. All parameters are evaluated using single or multi-item questions which are consequently converted into a 100-point score., Up to 48 months|Assess the impact of treatment on health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) by EORTC QLQ-G.I.NET-21 questionnaire, EORTC QLQG. I.NET-21 will be filled in by the patient prior to knowing computed tomography (CT) scan/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) result.

EORTC QLQ-G.I.NET-21 questionnaire is a module specific for neuroendocrine tumours and comprises 21 questions assessing disease symptoms, side effects of treatment, body image, disease related worries, social functioning, communication and sexuality. Each subscale is based on the following items: endocrine scale (items 31-33); gastrointestinal scale (34-38); treatment scale (39, 40, and 46); social function scale (42, 44, and 49); disease related worries scale (41, 43, and 47); muscle/bone pain (48), sexual function (51), information/communication function (50), and body image (45).

Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) is a standard way of measuring the ability of cancer patients to perform ordinary tasks. The KPS score ranges from 0 to 100. A higher score means the patient is better able to carry out daily activities.

Data on patients will be collected from the date when patient consent was obtained, during treatment with Lutathera® and for a follow-up period until end of study (EOS), defined as the time when the last enrolled patient has completed 36 months of assessments (unless early termination) after enrolment. Data will be collected in accordance with routine clinical visits.

The study duration will be 48 months in total: 12 months recruitment and 36 of follow-up from the last patient in.
