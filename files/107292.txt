Identifying Best Approach in Improving Quality of Life and Survival After a Donor Stem Cell Transplant in Older, Medically Infirm, or Frail Patients With Blood Diseases
This phase II/III trial studies the best approach in improving quality of life and survival after a donor stem cell transplant in older, weak, or frail patients with blood diseases. Patients who have undergone a transplant often experience increases in disease and death. One approach, supportive and palliative care (SPC), focuses on relieving symptoms of stress from serious illness and care through physical, cultural, psychological, social, spiritual, and ethical aspects. While a second approach, clinical management of comorbidities (CMC) focuses on managing multiple diseases, other than cancer, such as heart or lung diseases through physical exercise, strength training, stress reduction, medication management, dietary recommendations, and education. Giving SPC, CMC, or a combination of both may work better in improving quality of life and survival after a donor stem cell transplant compared to standard of care in patients with blood diseases.

Improvement in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) (Phase II), The arm with the largest mean change in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Bone Marrow Transplant (FACT-BMT) from baseline to day 90. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test will be used to compare change in FACT-BMT between arms, and this will also be the test to be used in computation of the conditional power at the end of phase II., First 90 days after HCT|Survival after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) (Phase III), At 1 year after HCT|Change in HRQOL (Phase III), Will be measured by the FACT-BMT., Baseline to 90 days post-HCT
Rate of overall survival, Overall survival will be compared between each of the experimental arms and the usual care only (UCO) arm using the log-rank test. Arms that do not survive the screening phase will also be included for comparison., Up to 1 year|Non-relapse mortality, Will be compared between arms using appropriate tests for continuous data (two-sample t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test, as appropriate for two-group comparisons; analysis of variance (ANOVA) or Kruskal-Wallis test for comparisons involving more than two groups). Will use generalized estimating equations (GEEs) approach for regression models, which can accommodate the within patient correlation structure and arbitrary patterns of missing data and also allow for the population average interpretation., At 90 days and up to 1 year|Cumulative incidence of relapse, Will be compared between arms using appropriate tests for continuous data (two-sample t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test, as appropriate for two-group comparisons; ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test for comparisons involving more than two groups). Will use GEEs approach for regression models, which can accommodate the within patient correlation structure and arbitrary patterns of missing data and also allow for the population average interpretation., Up to 1 year|Relapse-free survival, Will be compared between arms using appropriate tests for continuous data (two-sample t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test, as appropriate for two-group comparisons; ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test for comparisons involving more than two groups). Will use GEEs approach for regression models, which can accommodate the within patient correlation structure and arbitrary patterns of missing data and also allow for the population average interpretation., Up to 1 year|Cumulative incidence of frailty, Will be compared between arms using appropriate tests for continuous data (two-sample t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test, as appropriate for two-group comparisons; ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test for comparisons involving more than two groups). Will use GEEs approach for regression models, which can accommodate the within patient correlation structure and arbitrary patterns of missing data and also allow for the population average interpretation., Up to 1 year|Cumulative incidence of disability, Will be compared between arms using appropriate tests for continuous data (two-sample t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test, as appropriate for two-group comparisons; ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test for comparisons involving more than two groups).

Will use GEEs approach for regression models, which can accommodate the within patient correlation structure and arbitrary patterns of missing data and also allow for the population average interpretation., Up to 90 days after HCT|Duration of each hospitalization, Will be compared between arms using appropriate tests for continuous data (two-sample t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test, as appropriate for two-group comparisons; ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test for comparisons involving more than two groups).

OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 arms.

ARM I: Patients undergo SPC on days -15 before to +56 after transplant.

ARM II: Patients undergo a CMC program on days -15 before to +56 after transplant.

ARM III: Patients undergo interventions as outlined in Arm I and Arm II.

ARM IV: Patients receive standard of care.

In all arms, patients undergo HCT on day 0 and complete questionnaires and surveys at enrollment and 30, 90, 180, and 365 days post HCT. In all arms patients complete a 4-meter walk test, 6-minute walk test, up and go test, measured strength test and cognitive assessment at enrollment, 90, 180, and 365 days post HCT. Patients may also complete surveys on medical and non-medical (transportation, lodging) costs related to transplant after HCT.
