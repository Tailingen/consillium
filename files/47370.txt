A Study of HS-20089 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
HS-20089 is a novel DAR-6 antibody-drug conjugate （ADC） targeting B7-H4. In preclinical studies, it inhibited tumor cell growth expressing B7-H4 in vitro and in vivo. The first-in-human trial is conducted to assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT), to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and preliminary anti-tumor activity of HS-20089 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: HS-20089 (Phase Ia：Dose escalation )|DRUG: HS-20089 (Phase Ib: Dose expansion)
Maximum Tolerated Dose of HS-20089, To determine the MTD for further evaluation of IV administration of HS-20089 in subjects with advanced solid tumors., 3 weeks after initiation of treatment
Incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events, The CTCAE criteria will be used to assess adverse events on this trial., Baseline through study completion(90 days after last dose)|Observed maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) after single dose of HS-20089, Cmax will be obtained after single dose of HS-20089 on Day 1., From pre-dose to 120 hours after single dose on Day 1|Observed maximum plasma concentration (Cmax ss) after multiple dose of HS-20089, Cmax ss will be obtained on Day 1 of dosing in the 21-Day cycle of therapy., From pre-dose to 24 hours after the dose on Day 1 of the 21-Day cycle of therapy|Apparent terminal half-life (t1/2) after single dose of HS-20089, Apparent terminal half-life is the time measured for the concentration to decrease by one half., From pre-dose to 120 hours after single dose on Day 1|Area under plasma concentration versus time curve from zero to the 24-hour sampling time (AUC0-24) after single dose of HS-20089, Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time zero to the 24-hour sampling time at which the concentration was at or above the lower limit of quantification (LLQ)., From pre-dose to 24 hours after single dose on Day 1|Area under plasma concentration versus time curve from zero to last sampling time (AUC0-t) after single dose of HS-20089, Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time zero to the last sampling time t at which the concentration was at or above the lower limit of quantification (LLQ)., From pre-dose to 120 hours after single dose on Day 1|Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC0-∞) after single dose of HS-20089, AUC0-∞ was calculated by combining AUC0-t and AUCextra. AUCextra represents an extrapolated value obtained by Clast/ λz, where Clast is the calculated plasma concentration at the last sampling time point at which the measured plasma concentration is at or above the LLQ and λz is the apparent terminal rate constant determined by log-linear regression analysis of the measured plasma concentrations of the terminal log-linear phase., From pre-dose to 120 hours after single dose on Day 1|To further evaluation of the anti-tumor activity of HS-20089 by assessment of objective response rate (ORR), Anti-tumor efficacy will be assessed by best radiographic response based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors at baseline (Day -28 to -1). For patients that continue on repeating 21-Day cycles after the primary evaluation period, progression will be assessed after each 6 weeks of therapy. ORR is defined as the percentage of patients with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) that was confirmed at a subsequent scan at least 4 weeks later, as assessed according to RECIST version 1.1., From the date of first occurrence of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) on 2 consecutive occasions (≥4 weeks), until the date of disease progression or withdrawal from study，up to 2 years|Anti-drug Antibodies (ADA) of HS-20089, Number of participants who test positive for ADA to HS-20089 will be reported., Baseline through study completion(90 days after last dose)
This is a Phase 1a/1b open-label, multicenter study with dose escalation and dose expansion cohorts to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK and preliminary efficacy of HS-20089 in patients with advanced solid tumors.

The Dose Escalation will include an initial accelerated titration design followed by a Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design. Enrollment into Dose Expansion will begin after identification of the MTD and/or MAD in Phase 1a. In Phase 1b, preliminary efficacy will be evaluated in planned expansion cohorts that include patients with specific tumor types that are B7-H4+ advanced solid tumors.
