This is a phase I study, where the purpose is to find a safe dose of a new medicine called antibody 8H9. Antibodies are made by the body to fight infections and in some cases, to fight tumors. The antibody 8H9 is made by mice and can attack many kinds of tumors. 8H9 antibody can have a dose of radiation attached to it called 131-I. 131I-8H9 has been given in the vein to patients to find cancer cells. This is the first study using 131I-8H9 in the fluid in the spine to kill cancer cells. 131-I is a beta emitting isotope used extensively for radiation targeted therapies.
