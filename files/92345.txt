Quantitative and Functional Study of TH17 Lymphocytes in Horton's Disease (HD)
The aim of this open, controlled, multicentre biomedical research study is to identify new markers specifically associated with Horton's disease. This would make it possible to improve the diagnosis and management of this disease.

Participation consists in taking one or several blood samples depending on the group patients/controls.

OTHER: 1 blood sample|OTHER: 2 to 3 blood samples (at inclusion, at 3 months and at 6 months in cases of relapse)
Quantification of specific cytokines of the Th17 immune response (IL-17 A and IL-23) in the serum, Up to 6 months|Quantification of LTh17 by flow cytometry, Up to 6 months|Measurement of the activation level of genes specifically involved in Th17 response using RT-PCR on frozen mRNA, Up to 6 months|Measure the ability of Treg to proliferate and to synthesize IL-17 in response to different antigenic stimulations, Up to 6 months
