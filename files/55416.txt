Study of Cabozantinib in Combination With Atezolizumab Versus Second NHT in Subjects With mCRPC
This is a Phase 3, multi-center, randomized, open-label, controlled study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of cabozantinib given in combination with atezolizumab versus a second novel hormonal therapy (NHT) in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have previously been treated with one, and only one, NHT for their prostate cancer disease.

DRUG: Cabozantinib|DRUG: Atezolizumab|DRUG: Abiraterone Acetate|DRUG: Enzalutamide|DRUG: Prednisone
Duration of Progression Free Survival per Response Evaluable Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), Defined as time from randomization to the earlier of progressive disease (PD) per RECIST 1.1 as determined by the Blinded Independent Radiology Committee (BIRC) or death from any cause, Approximately 21 months after the first subject is randomized.|Duration of Overall Survival (OS), Defined as time from randomization to date of death from any cause, Approximately 37 months after the first subject is randomized
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR per RECIST 1.1 by BIRC, Approximately 37 months after the first subject is randomized
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of cabozantinib (XL184) in combination with atezolizumab versus a second NHT (abiraterone or enzalutamide) in subjects with mCRPC who have previously been treated with one, and only one, NHT (e.g. abiraterone, apalutamide, darolutamide, or enzalutamide) to treat metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC), non-metastatic CRPC (M0 CRPC), or mCRPC, and who have measurable extrapelvic disease. The multiple primary efficacy endpoints comparing the experimental arm and control arm are Duration of Progression Free Survival (PFS) per RECIST 1.1 by Blinded Independent Radiology Committee (BIRC) and Duration of Overall Survival (OS). The secondary efficacy endpoint is Objective Response Rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1 per BIRC.
