Analysis of Risk Factors for Hearing Loss in Survivors of Cancer Occurred During Childhood, Adolescence or Young Adulthood
This study is aimed at people treated for cancer before the age of 25, who have been followed for at least 5 years, and who are now aged between 18 and 50. It is a prospective, multicenter, non-randomized study.

The main aim of the project is to identify hearing impaired patients using the iAudiogram medical device, and to analyze the risk factors associated with the risk of hearing impairment.

Around 500 patients will take part in this study in France. Participation in this research project will consist in carrying out a hearing test (audiogram with tonal audiometry) with the iAudigram medical device (at Gustave Roussy, Curie or Necker Hospital) and completing self-questionnaires focusing on ototoxicity and its consequences.
Ototoxicity, Drug-Induced|Ototoxicity, Radiation-Induced|Pediatric Cancer
DEVICE: Audiogram
measurement of hearing loss by frequency and/or sound level, The patients explored with the automated tonal audiometry (iAudiogram medical device) with one of the following results as well as patients wearing a Lyric hearing prosthesis or any other permanent hearing prosthesis or cochlear implant will be considered as as having an audiological impairment:

* Average hearing loss at 500Hz 1kHz 2kHz 4kHz 8kHz, ≥ 30dB
* Hearing loss at least on 2 adjacent frequencies (among 500Hz 1kHz 2kHz 4kHz 8kHz) ≥ 30dB
* Hearing loss at 8kHz ≥ 40dB (Brock1, according to Brock Grading system)
* Asymmetrical hearing: interaural gap of ≥ 15 dB on two adjacent frequencies or interaural gap of ≥ 25 dB on one frequency
* Abnormal result on high-frequency audiometry: hearing loss at least on 2 points on frequencies 11.2-16 kHz, ≥ 30 dB, Baseline
