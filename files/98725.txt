Protocol for Radiofrequency Ablation of Pulmonary Neoplasms
This research trial involves the development of a new treatment for lung tumors. It is for patients whose tumor cannot be surgically removed, have refused surgery, or the tumor has not responded well to other forms of treatment. This treatment uses a needle probe to deliver energy into the lung tumor. This probe is placed utilizing a CT scan image. The energy heats the tumor causing tumor cell death.
