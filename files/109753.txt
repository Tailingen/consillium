Comprehensive Genomic Profiling and Next Generation Functional Drug Screening for Patients With Aggressive Haematological Malignancies
EXALT-2 is a prospective, randomized, three arm study for treatment decision guided either by either comprehensive genomic profiling, next generation drug screening or physician's choice

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Next generation functional drug screening|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Comprehensive genomic profiling
Percentage of patients with a ratio ≥1.3 of progression free survival (PFS) compared to most recent treatment, The study aims to identify if next-generation functional drug screening (ngFDS) and/or comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP; FoundationOne®Heme) compared to physicians' choice guided treatment will have an increased percentage of patients with a ratio

≥1.3 of progression free survival (PFS)/PFS of most recent treatment in patients with aggressive haematological malignancies, Through study completion, an average of 8 month
