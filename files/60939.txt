Efficacy Combined Fecal Immunochemical Test-Sigmoidoscopy for the Detection of Advanced Colorectal Neoplasia
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of fecal immunochemical test combined with sigmoidoscopy (FITS) for the detection of advanced colorectal neoplasia compared to colonoscopy.

Adenoma detection rate and sessile serrated polyp detection rate, We will evaluate adenoma detection rate and sessile serrated polyp detection rate on 7 days after sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy when pathologic diagnosis would be reported., on 7 days after intervention|Missing adenoma rate of sigmoidoscopy, We will evaluate missing adenoma rate of sigmoidoscopy on 7 dyas after sigmoidoscopy when pathologic diagnosis would be reported., on 7 days after intervention|The characteristic of polyps which would be missed by sigmoidoscopy, We will evaluated the characteristic of polyps which would be missed by sigmoidoscopy on 7 days after sigmoidoscopy when pathologic diagnosis would be reported., on 7 days after intervention|Cut off value of fecal immunochemical test that could have equal detection rate for colorectal cancer with colonoscopy., We will evaluate the cut off value of fecal immunochemical test that could have equal detection rate for colorectal cancer with colonoscopy on 7 days after colonoscopy when pathologic diagnosis would be reported., on 7 days after intervention|Sigmoidoscopic findings which could predict colorectal advanced adenomas with equal efficacy with colonoscopy, We will evaluate sigmoidoscopic findings which could predict colorectal advanced adenomas with equal efficacy with colonoscopy., on 7 days after intervention
The investigators will evaluate the efficacy of FITS for the detection of advanced colorectal neoplasia compared to colonoscopy. This study was designed as multicenter randomized interventional study. The expected period are 36months. A total 13 tertiary hospitals will participate in the study.

Subjects will be randomly allocated to FITS group and colonoscopy group. Subjects who undergo FITS will be performed by following colonoscopy to confirm the efficacy of FITS. In colonoscopy group, subjects as a control group would be performed colonoscopy.
