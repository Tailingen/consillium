Real-world Study of Sunvozertinib Treatment in Advanced EGFR-Mutant NSCLC After EGFR-TKI Treatment Failure
Observe the efficacy and safety of sunvozertinib in the real world in the treatment of EGFRm aNSCLC patients with previous EGFR-TKI treatment
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Sunvozertinib
Objective Response Rate (ORR), assess the proportion of subjects who have a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR)\], Time from first dose to last dose, up to 24 month
Progression-free survival (PFS), To assess anti-tumor activity of Sunvozertinib according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 by investigator, Time from first dose to first documented disease progression assessed by investigator or death due to any cause up to 24 month|Overall survival (OS), To assess anti-tumor activity of Sunvozertinib according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 by investigator, Time Frame: Time from first dose to the death of the subject due to any cause assessed up to 36 months.
Locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR-sensitive mutations who have been previously treated with EGFR-TKIs and PD for last therapy can be involved in this study. Investigators will assess patients whether to be suitable for sunvozertinib treatment. And this study will evaluate the safety and efficacy.
