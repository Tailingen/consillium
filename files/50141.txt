BATs in Patients With Breast Cancer and Leptomeningeal Metastases
This study uses bi-specific antibody (HER2Bi) armed activated T-cells (HER2 BATs) to target breast cancer cells that have metastasized to the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. This is known as leptomeningeal metastases. Two doses will be evaluated in order to determine a safe dose.

Study treatment includes a test dose of HER2 BATs followed by 8 weekly infusions of HER2 BATs at the assigned dose level. Before, during and after study treatment, participants will be monitored objectively by brain MRIs and clinically through physical and neurological exams, and blood and cerebrospinal fluid will be collected to evaluate immune responses.

For each potential symptom, there is an eleven-point scale where 0 is "Not Present" and 10 is "As Bad As You Can Imagine" so the minimum score would be 0 and the maximum score would be 240. For a subset of questions, the scale measures how much the symptoms interfered with other parts of life and the scale ranges from symptoms that "Did Not Interfere" (0) to those that "Interfered Completely" (10). Lower scores indicate fewer/less severe/less interfering symptoms and higher scores indicate more/more severe/more interfering symptoms., Prior to test dose of study treatment, prior to the 5th and 8th weekly infusions, and 30 days following last infusion|MD Anderson Symptom Inventory for Brain Tumors (MDASI- BT), The MDASI- BT is a 28 item questionnaire that focuses on symptoms related to brain tumors.

Once subjects are determined eligible, white blood cells (lymphocytes) are collected via leukapheresis procedure approximately 3 to 4 weeks prior to the first BATs infusion. The white blood cells, specifically T cells, are then mixed with two proteins in order to activate the cells to multiply.

After approximately 14 days in culture, the activated T cells are coated with OKT3 and trastuzumab/Herceptin (HER2Bi), and washed to remove excess Herceptin in order to produce bispecific antibody armed T cells (BATs). Cells are then frozen and stored until scheduled to be infused.

Up to 2 weeks following leukapheresis, participants will undergo surgery to place the catheter/reservoir into the lateral ventricle of the brain to allow intraventricular administration of HER2 BATs and a chemotherapy agent methotrexate. A few weeks later, participants will receive the intraventricular methotrexate in order to control disease while the BATs product is being manufactured. About 4-5 weeks following the leukapheresis and at least 7 days after receiving methotrexate, study treatment will begin with a test dose of HER2 BATs. If this dose is well tolerated by the participant, she will then receive 8 weekly doses of HER2 BATs at the assigned dose level.
