Foundation and Clinical About the Expression of PD-1 in Peripheral Blood T Lymphocytes
Providing more theoretical basis for the prediction of the efficacy of advanced NSCLC and helping select better advantaged population of NSCLC immunotherapy to maximize the benefits of patients By exploring the relationship between the changes of PD-1 expression in peripheral blood T lymphocytes and the clinical efficacy before and after the use of PD-1 / PD-L1 inhibitors.

Compare Progression Free Survival (PFS) Regimen using RECIST 1.1., PFS was defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of first documented disease progression or death, whichever occurs first. Disease progression was determined based on investigator assessment using response evaluation criteria In solid tumors (RECIST) v1.1., approximately 24 months
Compare Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS) was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause. Data for participants who were not reported as dead at the time of analysis was censored at the date when they were last known to be alive., approximately 24 months
From the perspective of immunology, it is intended to explore whether the expression of PD-1 in peripheral blood T lymphocytes can be used as a reference index for selecting immune "+" therapy in patients with advanced HCC, and to clarify the relationship between the expression level of peripheral blood T lymphocytes and the survival data of patients receiving immune "+" therapy. And explore whether there is consistency between the expression level of PD-L1 and that of PD-L1 on patients. At the same time, to explore whether there is a correlation between the distribution of T cell subsets and the efficacy of immunotherapy, so as to provide a new theoretical basis for the clinical screening of the target population of immune "+" therapy and a new clinical screening index for the prognosis assessment of patients.
