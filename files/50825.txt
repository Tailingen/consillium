Fibroids and the Risk of Miscarriage: a Prospective Observational Study in an Early Pregnancy Population
The aim of this observational study is to whether fibroids increase the risk of miscarriage in women in our early pregnancy population.

We will be collecting lots of data detailing other factors, which may have an impact on overall health and on the risk of miscarriage (this includes age, weight, use of vitamins or progesterone supplements, postcode which is linked to national deprivation scoring status and employment status).

By collecting all this data, we hope to remove the effect of other factors and purely assess the effect that the fibroids have on the outcome in early pregnancy.

We will also be looking closely at whether the location, number or size of the fibroids can affect the pregnancy too and following up women at 24 weeks via phone. We will also look at other secondary outcomes such whether women with fibroids experience symptoms of pain or bleeding in the first or second trimester more so than their control counterparts. We will also look at the value of uterine volume as a surrogate marker of fibroid mapping.

Once all the data has been analysed, we will be able to assess whether fibroids lead to an increased risk of miscarriage. We hope that this information will be useful in counselling women affected by fibroids in the pregnancy.
Fibroid|Miscarriage in First Trimester|Miscarriage in Second Trimester
Miscarriage prior to 24 weeks, Miscarriage prior to 24 weeks - or delivery prior to 24 weeks, From enrollment to the end of data collection (data would be collected from 24 weeks)
Risk of miscarriage based on fibroid characteristics, Risk of miscarriage based on volume, size and location of fibroids, From enrollment until data colelction (from 24 weeks)|Risk of miscarriage according to trimester, Risk of miscarriage according to trimester, From enrollment to end of data collection (from 24 weeks)|Presence of symptoms of pain or bleeding and association with fibroids and trimester, Presence of symptoms of pain or bleeding and association with fibroids and trimester, From enrollment to end of data collection (from 24 weeks)
Uterine volume and value as a surrogate marker for fibroid mapping, Can uterine volume be used as a surrogate marker for fibroid mapping - and does this have an association with miscarriage, From enrollment to end of data collection (from 24 weeks onwards).
