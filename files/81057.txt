Immunotherapy for the Treatment of Advanced Solid Tumor
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, side effects and benefits of autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) specific to personalized Neo-antigens in the treatment of patients with recurrent, metastatic and advanced solid tumors.
Recurrence Tumor|Metastatic Cancer|Solid Tumor
BIOLOGICAL: TIL|DRUG: Aldesleukin|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Fludarabine
Objective Responce Rate [Time Frame: 24 months after cell infusion], The Objective Responce Rate of patients received immunotherapy are accesed by the Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.0., 24 months after cell infusion
Adverse Event, Aggregate of all adverse events, as well as their frequency and severity are accessed by the Common Terminology Criteria in Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.03)., up to 24 months|Disease Control Rate, Disease control rate (DCR) as measured by RECIST 1.1 criteria., up to 24 months|Duration of Response, Duration of response (DOR) as measured by RECIST 1.1 criteria ., up to 24 months|Progression-Free Survival, PFS will be summarized using Kaplan-Meier estimates., up to 24 months|Overall Survival, The overall survival of all patients entering the study will be monitored., up to 24 months
Adoptive cell transfer therapy that utilizes an autologous TIL manufacturing progress is originally developed by the NCI for the treatment of patients with recurrent, metastatic cervical cancer and liver cancer. TILs specific to personalized neo-antigens will be expended in vitro and given back to the patients through vein. A total of 20 patients will be enrolled in the single-arm, open label, interventional study.
