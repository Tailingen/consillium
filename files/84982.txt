Chemotherapy Combined With Whole-body Hyperthermia to Treat Stage IIIB/IV Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
Millions of patients die of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) every year. There are several methods to treat NSCLC, including surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and bioimmuotherapy. Recently, hyperthermia therapy has played an important role in neoplasm therapy. It has showed some effect in NSCLC both in animal experiment and clinical practice, yet there is little literature about Whole-body Hyperthermia (WBH) with neoplasm. The investigators decides to develop this randomized contrasted multicenter clinical study to testify to the effect of chemotherapy combined with WBH to treat stage IIIB/IV Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).
