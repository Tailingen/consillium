Clinical Study of Venetoclax Combined With CACAG Regimen in the Treatment of Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia
The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of venetoclax combined with CACAG regimen with the traditional "3+7" regimen in the treatment of newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Azacytidine;Cytarabine;Aclacinomycin;Chidamide;Venetoclax;Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor|DRUG: "3+7"
Overall Response Rate (ORR) after 1 course of treatment, Defined as the percentage of participants achieving a best overall response of complete response (CR), CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi), or partial response (PR).Biological characteristics exploratory studies were analyzed by single-cell sequencing and Atac-seq. Further, according to European LeukemiaNet risk group, we analyzed the outcomes of patients by molecular subtype as a sub-group analysis., 1 months after the start of study treatment

Bone marrow blasts\<5 percent; absence of blasts with Auer rods; absence of extramedullary disease; absolute neutrophil count \>1.0 x 109/L (1000/µL); platelet count \>100 x 109/L (100,000/µL); independence of red cell transfusions., 2 months after study treatment|Complete Remission (CR) Rate after 2 courses of treatment, Defined in accordance with the IWG Response Criteria in AML. Bone marrow blasts\<5 percent; absence of blasts with Auer rods; absence of extramedullary disease; absolute neutrophil count \>1.0 x 109/L (1000/µL); platelet count \>100 x 109/L (100,000/µL); independence of red cell transfusions., after two courses of chemotherapy (each course is 28 days)|Overall Response Rate (ORR) after 2 course of treatment, Defined as the percentage of participants achieving a best overall response of complete response (CR), CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi), or partial response (PR).Biological characteristics exploratory studies were analyzed by single-cell sequencing and Atac-seq. Further, according to European LeukemiaNet risk group, we analyzed the outcomes of patients by molecular subtype as a sub-group analysis., after two courses of chemotherapy (each course is 28 days)|Rate of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD)-Negative Response, Percentage of participants who achieved MRD-negative response, defined as \< 1 leukemia cell per 10,000 leukocytes as assessed by flow cytometry., after two courses of chemotherapy (each course is 28 days)|Event-free survival, Defined as the time interval from treatment initiation to the occurrence of induction failure,relapse,or death,whichever came first., 180 days after study treatment|Overall Survival (OS), Defined as the time from joining the clinical study to death due to any cause., 180 days after study treatment|Treatment-related adverse events, Defined as adverse events that occurred from the first dose of study treatment to 30 days after the discontinuation of treatment., From the first dose of study treatment to 30 days after the discontinuation of treatment|Early death, Defined as death within 30 days of chemotherapy., Within 30 days of the start of the first course of treatment|Disease-free survival, Defined as the time interval from disease remission to the occurrence of relapse or death,whichever came first., 180 days after study treatment
Despite the availability of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and the emergence of many new therapeutic drugs, the prognosis of newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia is still poor.Over the past years, combination chemotherapy with anthracycline and standard dose cytarabine (standard "3+7" induction therapy) remains the standard induction. In order to improve the outcome of patients with de novo AML, we developed a venetoclax combined with CACAG regimen in the treatment of de novo AML. In this study, we intent to compare the efficacy and safety of venetoclax combined with CACAG regimen with the traditional "3+7" regimen in the treatment of newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia.
