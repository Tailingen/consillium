Effectiveness, Safety and Immunogenicity of GSK Biologicals' HPV Vaccine GSK580299 (Cervarix) Administered in Healthy Adolescents
Genital infections with oncogenic human papillomaviruses (HPV) are common in both men and women. The most important disease associated with oncogenic HPV infection is cervical cancer, currently the second leading cause of cancer-related death among women globally. The current study is designed to evaluate the overall impact of HPV immunization in adolescents 12-15 years of age.

BIOLOGICAL: Cervarix|BIOLOGICAL: Engerix-B
Number of Female Subjects With Overall Vaccine Effectiveness Against Genital Infection With Human Papilloma Virus (HPV)-16/18 Types in Cervarix/Engerix-B B Group Versus Engerix-B Group and in Cervarix/Engerix-B A Group Versus Engerix-B Group, The analysis of overall effectiveness of Cervarix vaccine against genital infection with HPV-16/18 types was based on stratified Mantel-Haenszel adjusted for clustering. The overall vaccine effectiveness was computed as 1- the prevalence odd ratio in all subjects from the investigated group (prevalence rate in all subjects from the investigated group/prevalence rate in all subjects from Engerix-B Group)., At the time of Visit 5 (i.e. at 18.5 years of age)
