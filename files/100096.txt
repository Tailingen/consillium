A Safety Study in Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
This is an open-label, dose-escalation study to determine the tolerability, safety profile, and antitumor activity of SGN-40 in patients with CLL. All patients will receive dose escalation during the first two weeks regardless of cohort designation.
Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic
DRUG: SGN-40 (anti-huCD40 mAb)
To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of multiple doses of SGN-40|To evaluate the safety profile, immunogenicity, and pharmacokinetics of SGN-40|To test the antitumor activity of SGN-40 in patients with CLL who have demonstrated recurrence or progression after at least one systemic therapy
A minimum of three patients will be entered into each dose-level cohort for five weeks. Escalation to the next cohort will occur when three patients have received at least one infusion at the highest scheduled dose level, and at least one patient has completed the entire five week dosing schedule. Cohorts will be enrolled at a maximal dose level of 3, 4, 6, or 8 mg/kg/week. Initial therapy will last for 5 weeks. Responding patients will receive additional infusions every two weeks x 4 at the maximal dose for each specific cohort.
