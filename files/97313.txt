Pembrolizumab in Combination With R-ICE Chemotherapy in Relapsed/Refractory Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma
This is an open-label, multicentre, randomised phase II trial in relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Ifosfamide|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Etoposide
To establish the event-free survival at 1 year in patients treated with P+R-ICE, Event free survival at 1 year (binary) - the proportion of patients alive and event free at 1 year. An event is defined as any of the following:

* Progression / relapse of lymphoma
* Stable disease at 3 cycles of therapy
* Commencement of any unplanned non-protocol treatment for lymphoma
* Death from any cause, 12 months
Event free survival (EFS) (time to event outcome) - median and at 1 and 2 years from Kaplan-meier curve, Event free survival (EFS) (time to event outcome) - median and at 1 and 2 years from Kaplan-meier curve - defined as time from day of registration until relapse or progression, unplanned re-treatment of lymphoma, or death as a result of any cause, whichever occurs first. Patients who do not experience an EFS event will be censored at the date of their last clinical follow-up., 12 months to 24 months|Progression-free survival (PFS) (time to event outcome) - median and at 1 and 2 years from Kaplan-meier curve, Progression-free survival (PFS) (time to event outcome) - median and at 1 and 2 years from Kaplan-meier curve - defined as the time from the day of registration to the date of progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Patients who do not experience progression, or death will be censored at the date of their last clinical follow up., 12 months to 24 months|Overall Survival (OS) (time to event outcome) - median and at 1 and 2 years from Kaplan-meier curve, Overall Survival (OS) (time to event outcome) - median and at 1 and 2 years from Kaplan-meier curve - defined as the time from the day of registration to the date of death from any cause. Patients who do not die will be censored at the date of their last follow up., 12 months to 24 months|Number of patients achieving 2 x 106 CD34 positive cells per kg stem cells on harvest, Number of patients achieving 2 x 106 CD34 positive cells per kg stem cells on harvest, 12 months|The number and proportion of patients achieving CR at the end of induction, The number and proportion of patients achieving CR at the end of induction (assessed by PET-CT at the end of cycle 3) determined by the Lugano response criteria, 12 months|The number and proportion of patients achieving CR at the end of transplantation., The number and proportion of patients achieving CR at the end of transplantation (PET-CT at week 27) determined by the Lugano response criteria. The Lugano response criteria determines a patient's response to treatment using a 1-4 staging to describe the spread of disease. Stage 1 being minimum spread of disease to stage 4 which is classed as a wide spread into at least one organ outside the lymph system. Clinicians will determine the Lugano response stage via a PET-CT image., 12 months|Number and proportion of patients achieving CR at any point during follow up., Number and proportion of patients achieving CR at any point during follow up determined by the Lugano response criteria. The Lugano response criteria determines a patient's response to treatment using a 1-4 staging to describe the spread of disease. Stage 1 being minimum spread of disease to stage 4 which is classed as a wide spread into at least one organ outside the lymph system. Clinicians will determine the Lugano response stage via a PET-CT image., 12 months|Number and proportion of patients with an Objective response at end of cycle 3., Number and proportion of patients with an Objective response (partial or complete metabolic response (PR or CR)) at end of induction assessed by PET-CT at end of cycle 3 determined by the Lugano response criteria. The Lugano response criteria determines a patient's response to treatment using a 1-4 staging to describe the spread of disease. Stage 1 being minimum spread of disease to stage 4 which is classed as a widespread into at least one organ outside the lymph system. Clinicians will determine the Lugano response stage via a PET-CT image., 12 months|Number and proportion of patients with an Objective response at the end of transplantation., Number and proportion of patients with an Objective response (partial or complete metabolic response (PR or CR)) assessed by PET-CT at the end of transplantation (week 27) as determined by the Lugano response criteria. The Lugano response criteria determines a patient's response to treatment using a 1-4 staging to describe the spread of disease. Stage 1 is the minimum spread of disease to stage 4 which is classed as a widespread into at least one organ outside the lymph system. Clinicians will determine the Lugano response stage via a PET-CT image., 12 months|Number and proportion of patients achieving an Objective response at any time point., Number and proportion of patients achieving an Objective response (CR or PR) at any point during follow up determined by the Lugano response criteria. The Lugano response criteria determines a patient's response to treatment using a 1-4 staging to describe the spread of disease. Stage 1 being the minimum spread of disease to stage 4 which is classed as a widespread into at least one organ outside the lymph system. Clinicians will determine the Lugano response stage via a PET-CT image., 12 months|Frequency, severity and causality of adverse and serious adverse events., Frequency, severity and causality of adverse and serious adverse events severity according to National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5., 12 months
The study has two treatment arms to which participants will be randomised on a 3:1 basis to the experimental arm. The control arm (Arm A) will be R-ICE for 3 cycles followed by an autologous stem cell transplant (for patients in a CR or PR on the post treatment PET-CT scan). The experimental arm (Arm B) will consist of P+R-ICE for 3 cycles followed by an autologous stem cell transplant (for patients in a CR or PR on the post treatment PET-CT scan) and maintenance Pembrolizumab every 3 weeks for one year.

All patients will be randomised at study entry and will be stratified by relapse within 12 months or \> 12 months of first line therapy.
