A Study of Prexasertib (LY2606368) in Platinum-Resistant or Refractory Recurrent Ovarian Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of prexasertib in women with platinum-resistant or refractory recurrent ovarian cancer.
Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: Prexasertib
Percentage of Participants Who Achieve Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR): Overall Response Rate (ORR), Overall response rate is the best response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as classified by the independent central review according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1). CR is a disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. PR is an at least 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline sum diameter) without progression of non-target lesions or appearance of new lesions. Overall response rate is calculated as a total number of participants with CR or PR divided by the total number of participants per cohort with at least 1 measurable lesion, multiplied by 100., Baseline through Disease Progression (Up to 6 months)
Pharmacokinetics (PK): Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of Prexasertib, Pharmacokinetics(PK): Maximum Plasma Concentration of Prexasertib. The same dose was administered to Cohort 1, 2, 3 and 4 and were combined for analysis., Cycle 1, Cycle 2, Cycle 4, Cycle 6 (Day 1 (End of prexasertib infusion (+15 min), 1-2 hours following end of prexasertib infusion), Cycle 2, day 1(Prior to start of prexasertib infusion)|Disease Control Rate (DCR): Percentage of Participants With a Best Overall Response of CR, PR, or Stable Disease (SD) for at Least 4 Months, DCR is defined as the number of participants who achieve a best overall response of CR, PR or SD for ≥4 months as determined by per RECIST version 1.1. CR is the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions; PR is a ≥30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions without new lesion and progression of non-target lesion; SD is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease. Disease control rate is calculated as a total number of participants with CR or PR or SD divided by the total number of participants treated, then multiplied by 100., Baseline through Disease Progression (up to 6 months)|Duration of Response, Duration of response is defined as the time from the date measurement criteria for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) are first met until the first date that disease is recurrent or objective progression is observed, per RECIST 1.1, or the date of death from any cause in the absence of objectively determined disease progression or recurrence. Participants known to be alive and without disease progression will be censored at the time of the last adequate tumor assessment., Date of CR or PR to Date of Disease Progression or Death Due to Any Cause (up to 20 months)|Percentage of Participants With at Least a 50% Reduction in CA-125 Levels From Baseline, CA-125 response is defined as ≥50% reduction in CA-125 levels from a pretreatment sample. The response must be confirmed and maintained for ≥28 days according to GCIG criteria. Participants must have a pretreatment sample that is ≥2 times the upper limit of the reference range and obtained within 2 weeks before starting the treatment., Baseline, 4 Weeks|Progression-Free Survival, Progression-Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the date of enrollment until the first occurrence of documented disease progression per RECIST 1.1, or death from any cause in the absence of progressive disease (PD). Participants known to be alive and without disease progression will be censored at the time of the last adequate tumor assessment., Baseline to Disease Progression or Death from any Cause (Up to 22 months)|Overall Survival, Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from the date of enrollment until death from any cause. If the participant is alive, lost to follow-up or withdrawn from study at the time of data analysis, OS data will be censored on the last date the participant is known to be alive., Baseline to Date of Death from Any Cause (Up to 26 months)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of prexasertib in women with platinum-resistant or refractory recurrent ovarian cancer.
