Endoscopic Ultrasonography-guided Double Ethanol Lavage for Pancreatic Cysts: a Prospective Cohort Study
Due to widespread use of cross-sectional imaging modalities, pancreatic cysts are common in abdominal image. These lesions encompass a wide spectrum, ranging from benign to malignant. The diagnosing specific type of cystic lesion is limited in spite of recent advances of diagnostic modalities. Surgical resection is generally recommended for malignant and potentially malignant lesions. However, surgical resection has significant morbidity and sometimes mortality. Recently, a few study of EUS-guided ethanol lavage for cystic tumors of the pancreas reported that complete resolution was achieved in only one-third of patients. Ethanol lavage of pancreatic cysts may be alternative method to surgical resection.

The purpose of this study is the double ethanol lavage is a safe and effective method for treatment in those with the indeterminate pancreas cysts.
Pancreatic Mucinous-Cystic Neoplasm
DRUG: Endoscopic ultrasonography-guided double ethanol lavage
Rate of Subjects with Complete or Partial response of treatment, Complete or partial response of treatment will be defined by the presence of a treated cystic structure, and its volume and maximum diameter in cross-sectional imaging studies (CT, MR), 1 year after final treatment
Incidence rate of adverse events after treatment, Adverse events include pancreatitis, bleeding, perforation, any other occurrence resulting in hospitalization, medical treatment, surgery, death, or disability, 1 year after final treatment
