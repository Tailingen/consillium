Phase III Study to Determine the Efficacy of Durvalumab in Combination With Chemotherapy in Completely Resected Stage II-III Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
This is a Phase III, randomized, parallel-arm, placebo controlled, double blind, multicenter study assessing the efficacy and safety of durvalumab versus placebo following SoC chemotherapy in patients with completely resected stage II-III NSCLC who are MRD+ post surgery
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
DRUG: Durvalumab + SoC chemotherapy|OTHER: Placebo + SoC chemotherapy
Disease-free Survival (DFS) in FAS (Using Investigator Assessments According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 [RECIST 1.1]), DFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization until either of the following events, whichever occurred first: disease recurrence using Investigator RECIST 1.1 assessments (i.e., local or regional recurrence, distant recurrence, second primary NSCLC) or death from any cause., Every 12 weeks (q12w) ± 1 week until appearance of RECIST 1.1-defined disease recurrence or until primary DFS analysis, up to 33.28 months
DFS in Minimal Residual Disease-positive (MRD+) Analysis Set (Using Investigator Assessments According to RECIST 1.1), DFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization until either of the following events, whichever occurred first: disease recurrence using Investigator RECIST 1.1 assessments (i.e., local or regional recurrence, distant recurrence, second primary NSCLC) or death from any cause., Every 12 weeks (q12w) ± 1 week until appearance of RECIST 1.1-defined disease recurrence or until primary DFS analysis, up to 33.28 months|OS in FAS, OS was defined as the time from the date of randomization until death due to any cause. Any participant not known to have died at the time of analysis was censored based on the last recorded date on which the participant was known to be alive., From the date of randomization until death due to any cause, up to 35 months|Overall Survival (OS) in MRD+ Analysis Set, OS was defined as the time from the date of randomization until death due to any cause. Any participant not known to have died at the time of analysis was censored based on the last recorded date on which the participant was known to be alive., From the date of randomization until death due to any cause, up to 35 months
Patients who have no evidence of disease recurrence confirmed by CT and/or MRI and are confirmed to meet all eligibility criteria will be randomized 1:1 to durvalumab + Standard of care (SoC) chemotherapy or placebo + Standard of care (SoC) chemotherapy arm.

The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of durvalumab +SoC chemotherapy compared to placebo+ SoC chemotherapy as measured by DFS in all patients.
