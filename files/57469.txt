PIPAC With Nab-paclitaxel and Cisplatin in Peritoneal Carcinomatosis
Phase Ib trial including investigating the combination of nab-paclitaxel and cisplatin in patients diagnosed with peritoneal carcinomatosis related to pancreatic, oeso-gastric, ovarian cancer or primitive peritoneal mesothelioma.
Peritoneal Carcinomatosis
DRUG: Nab paclitaxel|DRUG: Cisplatin
Determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of Nab paclitaxel (Abraxane®) administered IP by PIPAC in concomitance with cisplatin., MTD is defined as the lowest dose level at which ≥33% of patients' experience dose limiting toxicity in accordance to CTCAE version 5.0 criteria., From the time of treatment randomization through 30 days following cessation of treatment
Adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE), AE and SAE with predefined toxicity criteria will be applied using CTCAE version 5.0 criteria, documented before and after each cycle of PIPAC treatment. Surgical complications will be assessed according to Clavien classification and comprehensive complication index (CCI), D-1/D10 of each cycle|The efficacy, It will be assessed by the objective histological regression and objective tumor response rate (OTR) according to the new regression system for peritoneal cancer (PRGS, peritoneal regression grade score system). The objective response rate (ORR), the clinical benefit rate (CBR) as defined by RECIST version 1.1 criteria and the relevance of radiological response assessed by CT enterography (CT-PCI score)., D0 of each cycle|The QoL, QoL will be evaluated based on the EORTC questionnaire QLQ-C30 Version 3.0 and visual analogic scale for pain (VAS scale)., D-1/D10 of each cycle
Phase Ib trial investigating the combination of intraperitoneal Cisplatin (10.5 mg/m2) and Nab-paclitaxel (escalated dose from 7.5 mg/m2 to 70 mg/m2) administered by pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy (PIPAC) every 4-6 weeks for 3 cycles.
