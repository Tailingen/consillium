This research study aims to address the limited understanding of the challenges faced by specific demographic groups of chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients in their participation in clinical trials.

This trial will scrutinize the experiences of patients diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia as they take part in a separate medical intervention clinical trial. The focus will be on tracking the rates of completion and withdrawal among these individuals.

It will also try to analyze data from the perspective of different demographic groups to check for recurring trends which might yield insights for the sake of future chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients.
