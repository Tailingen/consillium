Cancer and Blood Pressure Management, CARISMA Study
This phase II trial studies how well intensive blood pressure management works in decreasing systolic blood pressure in patients with kidney or thyroid cancer that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic) who are starting anti-angiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitor cancer therapy. This study is being done to find out if a systolic blood pressure to a target of less than 120 mmHg (intensive systolic blood pressure management) can be achieved, well tolerated, and beneficial as compared to the usual approach to a target of less than 140 mmHg while taking an anti-angiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitor. This study may help doctors understand the best way to control blood pressure in kidney or thyroid cancer patients taking anti-angiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitor.

Differences in systolic blood pressure (SBP) based on automated office BP measurements, Differences in SBP over the 6- month study period between intensive BP control (intervention) versus standard care (non-intervention group) will be compared using the "difference-indifference" method. All mixed effects models will be estimated using generalized estimating equations (GEE)., Up to 6 months

These include the incidence of significant CV events including stroke, acute coronary syndrome/myocardial infarction or hospitalization for heart failure; the suspension of anti-angiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors therapy due to toxicity; or all-cause death., Up to 6 months
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To determine the feasibility of an intensive (systolic blood pressure \[SBP\] \< 120 mmHg) "Intervention" versus standard care (SBP \< 140 mmHg) "Non-Intervention" approach to blood pressure (BP) control in metastatic renal cell and thyroid cancer patients initiating anti-angiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

ARM A: Patients receive intensive systolic blood pressure management for 6 months. Patients receive increased blood pressure medication every 2 weeks while systolic blood pressure is 120 mmHg or higher. Patients also monitor blood pressure at home 1 day a week (4 times in 1 day) every 2 weeks and upload the recorded blood pressure readings to the provider and to a central blood pressure monitoring team. Patients with changes in blood pressure medications monitor blood pressure readings on 3 days in 1 week (4 times in 1 day).

ARM B: Patients receive standard blood pressure management for 6 months. Patients receive blood pressure medications per doctor's instruction. Patients also monitor blood pressure at home 1 day (4 times in 1 day) every 2 weeks and upload the recorded blood pressures to a central monitoring team.
