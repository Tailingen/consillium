Repurposed Drugs to Improve Haematological Responses in Myelodysplastic Syndromes
Over 7,000 people in the UK are living with Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS). Approximately 1,600 of these individuals (23%) die each year from their disease. MDS affects the production of blood cells by the bone marrow, causing chronic fatigue, bleeding, and recurrent infections. Many patients die because their disease transforms into acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) an even more aggressive blood cancer. The general outlook for AML is poor, but when AML arises from MDS it is worse.

REPAIR-MDS seeks to repurpose existing drugs in order to dramatically improve the outlook, health and quality of life of people with MDS. The trial treatments aim to improve the production of healthy functioning blood and immune cells that will fight against infections and boost the immune system's action against the MDS clone.

REPAIR-MDS design is a is a multicentre open label phase 2 randomised controlled trial which will compare VBaP (sodium valproate, bezafibrate, medroxyprogesterone) with danazol in patients who have received either Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents (ESAs) and lost response, not responded to ESAs or are deemed unlikely to respond to ESAs.
Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS)
DRUG: Sodium Valproate, Bezafibrate, Medroxyprogesterone|DRUG: Danazol
Haematological improvement (HI) in each arm and in the trial overall, with 25% or more of the participants having HI in each arm and overall., HI will be assessed in each participant by comparing post randomisation FBC parameters (Haemoglobin, platelet and neutrophil counts) and transfusion requirements, with their individual baseline as determined by the IWG 2018 haematology response criteria in patients with MDS., 12 months
Reduced burden of red cell and/or platelet transfusion in each arm and in the trial overall, as per the IWG 2018 response criteria., Changes in transfusion requirements will be assessed in each participant by comparison with their individual 16-week lead-in baseline as determined by the IWG 2018 haematology response criteria in patients with MDS., 12 months|Duration of haematological response, Clinically meaningful haematological responses that persist for 16 weeks or longer., 12 months|Reported improved Health Related Quality of Life scores in each arm and in the trial overall., The four Health Related Quality of Life questions measure 1) self-perceived health (excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor), (2) number of days out of the past 30 that physical health was not good, (3) number of days out of the past 30 that mental health was not good, and (4) number of days out of the past 30 that usual activities were limited by poor physical or mental health of life scores will be evaluated using established protocols., 12 months|Overall survival, Overall survival at close of trial will be reported separately for each trial arm, Through study completion, an average of 1 year
