Clinician-Collected Versus Patient-Collected Cervical Pap Smears
The purpose of this study is to see if it is possible to conduct a full study to determine whether the SoloPap™ cervical cell sample collection kit is as good as a clinician performed Pap test in detecting precancerous cervical lesions in females.

Begin to determine patient attitudes regarding ease of use and discomfort using SoloPap.
Cervical Cancer
DEVICE: Patient-Collected Cervical Pap Smear
Concordance of Pap Test Results Between Self- and Physician-collected Pap Tests, whether the SoloPap™ cervical cell sample collection kit used by the subject (patient) is as good as a clinician performed Pap test in detecting precancerous cervical lesions in females., 1 hour
Patient Opinions, Results from a survey about simple subject attitudes regarding the SoloPap.

Patient Solo Pap Kit Questions

1. Did you experience any discomfort while using the Solo Pap Kit? Yes / No
2. Would you use the Solo Pap Kit for future Pap Tests? Yes / No
3. Would you recommend the Solo Pap Kit to a friend or family member? Yes / No, Directly after interventions (Solo Pap and physician-collected pap smear samples)
The SoloPap "kit" provides to subjects who would not otherwise have a Pap smear done a convenient and private way to collect samples and ship them to a laboratory for processing. The current study is pilot/pre-cursor study for a larger subsequent study that aims to determine whether SoloPap is truly noninferior to clinician-collected Pap smears in detecting cervical pathology. It will also determine user preference and willingness to perform a self- test.
