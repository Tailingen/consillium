ctDNA as a Biomarker for Treatment in Advanced NSCLC
The dynamic monitoring of circulating tumor DNA aims to evaluate the response and progression-free survival of short-course chemotherapy (2 cycles) combined with immunotherapy in patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Immunotherapy|DRUG: Chemotherapeutic Agent|DRUG: Chemotherapy
Change in ctDNA Level Following Chemo-immunotherapy, Will be assessed for ctDNA levels at baseline, end of chemotherapy, and immunotherapy maintenance, up to 1 year
Progression-free survival, From the date of treatment until the date of progression of lung cancer or death from any other cause assessed up to 12 months, up to 1 year|Overall survival, From the date of treatment until the date of death from any cause assessed up to 24 months, up to 24 months
For patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic non-small cell lung cancers, 4-6 cycles of chemotherapy plus immunotherapy with immune maintenance therapy is currently the standard treatment. Short-course chemotherapy (2 cycles) combined with immunotherapy has been proved effective in some patients. Recently, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has been detected in the cell-free component of peripheral blood samples in advanced non-small cell lung cancers and many other solid tumors. To identify the patients who can benefit from the short-course chemotherapy (2 cycles) combined with immunotherapy, dynamic monitoring of ctDNA in both 4-6 cycles and 2 cycles chemotherapy patients could be a promising alternative test.
