This study is a prospective, single-arm, single-center phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of immune checkpoint inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy and recombinant human endostatin in patients with advanced (stage IIIB-IV) squamous non-small cell lung cancer. Patients with locally advanced stage ⅢB/ⅢC, metastatic or recurrent stage IV squamous NSCLC who were not operable and could not receive radical concurrent chemoradiotherapy were selected after signing informed consent. Eligible subjects who met the inclusion criteria were screened for immune checkpoint inhibitor combined with chemotherapy and recombinant human endostatin. After cycles 4 to 6, maintenance therapy with an immune checkpoint inhibitor and endostatin was administered until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, initiation of additional antineoplastic therapy, death, or other protocol-specified discontinuation of treatment, whichever occurred first.
