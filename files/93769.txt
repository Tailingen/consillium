Pooled Mutant KRAS-Targeted Long Peptide Vaccine Combined With Nivolumab and Ipilimumab for Patients With Resected Mismatch Repair Protein (MMR-p) Colorectal and Pancreatic Cancer
Phase 1 study for patients with resected PDAC after neoadjuvant and/ or adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation, as well as patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have exposure to 2 or more lines of chemotherapy, to evaluate safety and the immune response to pooled mutant-KRAS peptide vaccine (KRAS peptide vaccine) with poly-ICLC adjuvant in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab.
Colorectal Cancer|Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: KRAS peptide vaccine|DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: Ipilimumab
Number of participants experiencing study drug-related toxicities, Number of participants experiencing study drug-related adverse events Grade 3 or higher as defined by CTCAE v5.0, 2 years|Fold change in interferon-producing mutant-KRAS-specific cytotoxic (CD8) and helper (CD4) T cells at 16 weeks, Evaluated by the fold change in interferon-producing mutant-KRAS-specific CD8 and CD4 T cells after vaccination at 16 weeks compare to pre-vaccination baseline., Baseline, 16 weeks
Disease Free Survival (DFS), DFS is defined as the number of months from cycle 1, day 1 of vaccination until the first documented disease recurrence or death due to any cause in patients with resected PDAC. Will be censored at the date of the last progressive disease evaluation if no event observed., 4 years|Percentage change of interferon (IFN)-γ-producing mutant-KRAS-specific CD8 and CD4 T cells, Percent change of IFN-γ-producing mutant-KRAS-specific CD8 and CD4 T cells at any time after vaccination., 2 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1, ORR is defined as the number of patients with metastatic microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC who are administered at least one dose of KRAS achieving a complete response (CR) partial response (PR) based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) at any time during the study. CR = disappearance of all target lesions, PR is =\>30 percent decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, progressive disease (PD) is \>20 percent increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, stable disease (SD) is \<30 percent decrease or \<20 percent increase in sum of diameters of target lesions., 4 years|Progression-free Survival (PFS) for RECIST 1.1, PFS is defined as the numbers of months from the date of the first vaccine dose to the date of disease progression or death due to any cause, which ever occurs first, for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (mCRC) patients. Censored at the date of last scan for subjects without documentation of disease progression (PD) at the time of analysis or relapse from complete response \[CR\] as assessed using RECIST 1.1 criteria) or death due to any cause. Per RECIST 1.1 criteria, CR = disappearance of all target lesions, Partial Response (PR) is =\>30 percent decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, Progressive Disease (PD) is \>20 percent increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, Stable Disease (SD) is \<30 percent decrease or \<20 percent increase in sum of diameters of target lesions., 4 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS will be measured as the number of months from the date of first vaccine dose until death or end of follow up. OS will be censored on the date the subject was last known to be alive for subjects without documentation of death at the time of analysis. Estimation based on the Kaplan Meier Curve, 4 years
