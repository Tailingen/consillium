Targeted Pediatric High-Grade Glioma Therapy
The goal of this study is to perform genetic sequencing on brain tumors from children, adolescents, and young adult patients who have been newly diagnosed with a high-grade glioma. This molecular profiling will decide if patients are eligible to participate in a subsequent treatment-based clinical trial based on the genetic alterations identified in their tumor.

Molecular profiling, Utilize molecular, clinical, and histopathologic data to assess eligibility for specific biologically-guided treatment subprotocols among pediatric, adolescent and young adult patients with newly diagnosed HGG, including DIPG., 4 years|Feasibility of molecular profiling and enrollment to a TarGeT treatment protocol, Determine the percent of pediatric, adolescent, and young adult patients newly diagnosed with HGG, including DIPG, who undergo comprehensive molecular characterization across clinical molecular testing laboratories at CONNECT sites and begin treatment on a TarGeT treatment subprotocol within 10 calendar days of starting radiation therapy (RT) (if treatment involves an agent given concurrently with RT) or within 35 days of completion of RT (if treatment involves adjuvant maintenance therapy)., 4 years
Genomic Research, Increase knowledge of the genomic and immunologic landscape of newly-diagnosed pediatric and young adult HGGs, including DIPG, through comprehensive molecular characterization., 6 years|Germline susceptibility testing, Determine the frequency and spectrum of germline cancer susceptibility mutations in children and young adults with HGG and DIPG and assess the feasibility of return of those results., 4 years|Biobanking, Prospectively collect tumor tissue from diagnostic biopsy/resection as well as baseline peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples for the CONNECT biorepository to be used in correlative research for the present trial as well as future studies., 4 years
A novel, molecularly-guided, multi-arm phase umbrella II trial is proposed in children, adolescents, and young adults with newly diagnosed HGG, including DIPG, in which we will (1) conduct comprehensive molecular screening of tumor tissue using a multi-omic approach (WES/WGS, gene fusion panels/RNASeq, DNA methylation microarray) across international CONNECT genomics cores with rapid return of clinical results, (2) stratify patients to biologically-targeted treatment arms, based on the tumor molecular profile and histopathology, and (3) perform longitudinal evaluation of peripheral blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and/or tumor tissue as well as advanced neuro-imaging to determine genomic, immune, and radiologic biomarkers predictive of response, recurrence, resistance, and toxicity.

Based on results of the above tumor molecular profiling and pathology-based confirmation of HGG diagnosis, eligible patients will be assigned to one of several biologically guided treatment arms on a phase II trial.

Approximately 400-450 patients will be enrolled on the screening protocol through which biospecimens (paired tumor DNA/RNA and normal comparator samples) will undergo extensive molecular profiling to assess eligibility to any of the therapeutic subprotocols of the phase II study.
