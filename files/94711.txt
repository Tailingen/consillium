A Prospective Study of Liquid Biopsy for Pancreatic Cancer Early Detection
This study is a multi-center, observational study aiming at developing a machine learning-based early detection model using prospectively collected liquid biopsy samples from clinically-annotated individuals.
Pancreatic Cancer
Performance of cfDNA methylation-based model for discriminating pancreatic cancer versus non-cancer, Sensitivities of cfDNA methylation-based model at specificity of 99% and 95%, respectively., 12 months
Performance of models using multi-omic data for discriminating pancreatic cancer versus non-cancer, Sensitivities of model integrating multi-omics data at specificity of 99% and 95%,respectively., 12 months|Performance of pre-defined model in clinical sub-groups of interest, Sensitivity of pre-defined model in different pathological subtypes or different age groups or tumor marker-negative cases., 12 months
Peripheral blood samples from participants with new diagnosis of pancreatic cancers will be collected to characterize the cancer-specific circulating signals by sequencing cell free DNA. A noninvasive test integrating machine learning algorithm will be trained and validated through a two-stage approach in recruited well-classified individuals, along with non-cancers without clinical diagnosis of cancer after routine medical screening. The performance of liquid biospy assays discovering cancer from non-cancer will be evaluated in participants with benign disease as well as average risk individuals.
