A Phase II Study of PF-03446962 in Patients With Advanced Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma
This is a non-randomized open label multicentre Phase II trial to evaluate the response rate of PF03446962 in patients with advanced malignant pleural mesothelioma who have been previously treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy.
Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma
DRUG: PF-03446962
Response Rate, Assessing the efficacy (response rate, complete and partial) of PF-03446962 given by IV infusion Day 1 of a 2 week cycle(14 days = 1 cycle) in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma and previously treated with cytotoxic therapy., 30 months
Amount and severity of adverse events, To assess toxicity, safety and tolerability of PF-03446962., 30 months|Duration of Response, To assess the duration of response or stable disease, stable disease rate, progression-free survival, median and overall survival rates, 30 months|Blood and tissue marker evaluation, Specimen collection to look for markers in cancer cells. These markers might help predict which patients are most likely to be helped by the study drug PF-03446962., 30 months
