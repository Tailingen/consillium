Measuring Alterations of DNA in Human Blood
The purpose of this research is to evaluate an automated, laser-based technique for measuring DNA damge resulting from radiation. We want to use controlled exposure on cancer patients to help develop a measurement to test people who may have been accidentally exposed to radiation.
