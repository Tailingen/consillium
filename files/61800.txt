Study of Intratumoral Ipilimumab and TLR4 Agonist GLA-SE in Combination With Systemic Nivolumab and Chemotherapy
To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and the toxicity profile (NCI CTCAE v5.0 and immune related adverse events) of i.t. administration of anti-CTLA4 antibody (ipilimumab) and TLR4 agonist (synthetic glucopyranosyl lipid A formulated in a stable emulsion \[GLA-SE\]) in colorectal LM (CRLM) in combination with intravenous (i.v.) administration of anti-PD-1 antibody (nivolumab) and chemotherapy (FOLFOX regimen).

Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), MTD will be determined based on the DLT definitions and identified as the maximum dose level at which less than 33% of DLT are observed in the evaluable patients., For all the cohorts, the DLT period to determine the MTD will be 28 days|Recommanded phase 2 dose (RP2D), RP2D will be determined based on the MTD identified, on analysis of DLT defining events, RP2D will be assessed on 8 weeks
