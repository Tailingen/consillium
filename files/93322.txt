A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Activity of Belvarafenib as a Single Agent and in Combination With Either Cobimetinib or Cobimetinib Plus Nivolumab in Patients With NRAS-mutant Advanced Melanoma.
This study will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and activity of belvarafenib as a single agent and in combination with either cobimetinib or cobimetinib plus nivolumab in patients with NRAS-mutant advanced melanoma who have received anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy.

The study will evaluate three treatment regimens in three arms: a belvarafenib monotherapy arm (Belva arm); a belvarafenib plus cobimetinib arm (Belva + Cobi arm) in an initial dose-finding phase followed by an expansion phase and a belvarafenib plus cobimetinib plus nivolumab arm (Belva + Cobi + Nivo arm) in a run-in phase followed by an expansion phase.
