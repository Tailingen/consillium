Protocol for High-Risk Assessment, Screening, and Early Detection of Pancreatic Cancer
The purpose of this study is to find out whether Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) can detect early stage pre-cancerous or cancerous changes in the pancreas in patients at high-risk for the development of pancreatic cancer. Endoscopic refers to the use of an instrument called an endoscope - a thin, flexible tube with a tiny video camera and light on the end. Ultrasound refers to an imaging technique that uses sound waves to produce pictures. EUS in this research study is a method of combining endoscopy and ultrasound imaging to obtain high quality images of the pancreas.
Pancreatic Cancer
PROCEDURE: Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS)
Number of Abnormalities Detected by EUS, To determine whether targeted screening of these high-risk individuals using Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) at regular intervals can detect precancerous pancreas changes or early stage asymptomatic pancreatic cancer., Average of 5 years
