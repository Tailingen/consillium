Evaluation of Mailers Promoting Mammogram Screening
In this evaluation, 3 different versions of mailers promoting annual mammograms are being sent to women on the month of their 50th and 64th birthdays. The researchers hypothesize that the use of behavioral nudges in the mailers should lead to increased uptake in mammogram screening.
Breast Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Postcard|BEHAVIORAL: Small Gift|BEHAVIORAL: Loss Frame and Fear Appeals
Mammogram Completion at 6 months (2020), Binary variable indicating whether a mammogram was completed, 6 months from intervention start date
Mammogram Completion at 12 months (2020), Binary variable indicating whether a mammogram was completed (a longer time frame allows for late responses), 12 months from intervention start date|Primary Care Provider Visits at 6 months (2020), Number of visits (proxy for increased preventative health care), 6 months from intervention start date|Primary Care Provider Visits at 12 months (2020), Number of visits (proxy for increased preventative health care), 12 months from intervention start date|Obstetrician-Gynecologist Visits at 6 months (2020), Number of visits (proxy for increased preventative health care), 6 months from intervention start date|Obstetrician-Gynecologist Visits at 12 months (2020), Number of visits (proxy for increased preventative health care), 12 months from intervention start date|Breast Cancer Diagnosis at 6 months (2020), Binary variable indicating whether the recipient was diagnosed with breast cancer, 6 months from intervention start date|Breast Cancer Diagnosis at 12 months (2020), Binary variable indicating whether the recipient was diagnosed with breast cancer, 12 months from intervention start date|Emergency Department Visits at 6 months (2020), Number of Emergency Department Visits (proxy for increased costly utilization of health system resources), 6 months from intervention start date|Emergency Department Visits at 12 months (2020), Number of Emergency Department Visits (proxy for increased costly utilization of health system resources), 12 months from intervention start date
Mammogram Completion at 12 months (2019), Binary variable indicating whether a mammogram was completed to be used for exploratory pre-post comparisons, 12 months from 2019 intervention start date|Primary Care Provider Visits at 12 months (2019), Number of visits to be used for exploratory pre-post comparisons (proxy for increased preventative health care), 12 months from 2019 intervention start date|Breast Cancer Diagnosis at 12 months (2019), Binary variable indicating whether the woman was diagnosed with breast cancer, 12 months from 2019 intervention start date|Emergency Department Visits at 12 months (2019), Number of Emergency Department Visits (proxy for increased costly utilization of health system resources), 12 months from 2019 intervention start date
Mammogram screening for women, starting at age 50, can significantly reduce the risk of complications due to breast cancer. As part of an existing outreach campaign, the health system mails a postcard and small gift (pink socks) to women on the month of their 50th and 64th birthdays to promote annual mammogram screening.

The researchers are evaluating two new versions of the mailers against a standard mailer to see which version leads to greater uptake in mammograms. The new mailers have content that applies behavioral nudge theory - specifically, loss frames and fear appeals - to encourage taking action. One of the two new versions does not include the small gift, to test whether its inclusion or exclusion has any effect on mammogram screening.
