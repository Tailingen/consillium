Comparison of Drainage Methods in Minimally Invasive Esophagectomy
This RCT compares three drainage approaches after minimally invasive esophagectomy (chest tube + thoracic mediastinal drainage tube, thoracic, and abdominal mediastinal drainage tube) to evaluate perioperative outcomes, addressing current evidence gaps in pain and complication profiles.

Postoperative Pain Scores, Pain scores were assessed based on the visual analog scale according to the World Health Organization guidelines, in which 0 indicated no pain and 10 indicated the worst possible pain.

We also recorded and evaluated maximum daily pain scores when pain caused by the mediastinal drainage tube incision., Pain scores were recorded at different times during the postoperative period when the patients were quiet and active (at 7 AM, 11 AM, 3 PM, and 7 PM) from postoperative day 1 to postoperative day 4.
Postoperative complications, Postoperative complications included anastomotic leak, major pulmonary complications, and major abdominal complications. Pleural effusion was defined as a drainage volume of greater than 800 mL. Pneumothorax was defined by a distance of greater than 3 cm between the apex of the lung and the top of the ribcage on chest radiography., Postoperative complications from posoperative day 1 to postoperative month 3
