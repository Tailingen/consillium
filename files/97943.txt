Evaluation of Oral Potentially Malignant Disorders (OPMDs) with STRATICYTE™
The purpose of this study is to validate the ability of the STRATICYTE™ predictive model to predict the transformation of oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs) to oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) in a retrospective cohort of patients who received biopsies.
Mouth Diseases
OTHER: STRATICYTE™ Test
Sensitivity and Specificity, Standard measures of accuracy calculated using cross-tabulation of predicted risk category and confirmed cancer progression over a 5-year period from biopsy, 5 years|Survival analysis, Kaplan-Meier analyses to compare time to a positive diagnosis of oral cancer between patients/biopsies with a STRATICYTE™ classification of Low- and Elevated-Risk., 5 years
AUC, Area under the receiver operator curve, 5 years|C-index (Harrell's), From all possible pairs of patients, compute the number of concordant and discordant pairs. Compute C-index as the proportion of all possible pairs that are concordant., 5 years
The study objectives are to:

1. Evaluate STRATICYTE™ sensitivity and specificity in a cohort of patients that meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria.
2. Identify patient and clinical characteristics influencing the sensitivity and specificity of the STRATICYTE™ model.
3. Estimate the correlation between STRATICYTE™ outcome and time to a positive diagnosis of oral cancer.
