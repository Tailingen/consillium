Follow-Up Study for Men Diagnosed With Prostate Cancer Through Participation in a Prostate Specific Antigen Screening Program
There is controversy concerning the preferred treatment for men with localized prostate cancer with regard to the relative effectiveness of different treatments in controlling the cancer and how different treatments affect the patient's quality of life. The purpose of this research is to describe the disease course of prostate cancer and to determine the effectiveness, potential complications, and quality of life after different treatments in men with prostate cancer detected via screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and/or digital rectal examination
