Phase 1/2 Study Evaluating Safety and Potential Efficacy of Allocetra-OTS Via Pressurized Intra-Peritoneal Aerosol Chemotherapy as Add-on to Standard of Care Chemotherapy for Treatment of Peritoneal Metastasis
This is an open-label study to evaluate safety and potential efficacy of Allocetra-OTS in the treatment of patients with peritoneal metastasis as an add-on to the standard of care (SoC) chemotherapy.

Pressurized Intra-Peritoneal Aerosol Chemotherapy (PIPAC) is utilized in patients with malignant dissemination to the peritoneal cavity, for the treatment of peritoneal metastasis that have a high tumor burden or are unresectable, and are unresponsive to systemic therapy.

Allocetra-OTS is an immunomodulatory cell-based therapy consisting of allogeneic peripheral blood mononuclear cells that have been modified to be engulfed by macrophages and reprogram them into their homeostatic state.

The study will evaluate the safety and potential efficacy of Allocetra-OTS in the treatment of peritoneal metastasis as an add-on to the standard of care (SoC) chemotherapy. Patients will be treated with escalating doses of Allocetra-OTS as an add-on to the chemotherapy administered via PIPAC, and in addition to systemic chemotherapy.
