Combination Chemotherapy for 3 Months or 6 Months in Treating Patients With Stage III Colon Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as oxaliplatin, leucovorin calcium, and fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. It is not yet known whether giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) is more effective when given for 3 months or 6 months in treating patients with colon cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying giving combination chemotherapy for 3 months to see how well it works compared with giving combination chemotherapy for 6 months in treating patients with stage III colon cancer.
Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: FOLFOX regimen|DRUG: CAPOX
Disease-free survival (DFS), DFS, defined as the time from random assignment to relapse or death, whichever occurred first. Secondary colorectal cancers were regarded as DFS events, whereas noncolorectal cancers were disregarded in the analysis., 3 years after randomisation
Overall survival (OS), The time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause, Death from randomization; up to 7 years after randomization|Safety profile, All grade and severe toxicities, according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0, Assessed up to 6 months after randomisation|Treatment compliance, duration, dose intensity, and dose in mg/m2, Until 3 months or 6 months (according randomization arm)
OBJECTIVES:

Primary Objective

* To assess whether a 3-month modified FOLFOX 6 or XELOX treatment is not inferior to a 6-month modified FOLFOX 6 or XELOX treatment in terms of disease free survival (DFS) in patients with radically resected stage III colon cancer.

Secondary Objectives

* To assess whether 3-month modified FOLFOX 6 (6 cycles) or XELOX (4 cycles) treatment is not inferior to 6-month modified FOLFOX 6 (12 cycles) or XELOX (8 cycles) treatment in terms of overall survival (OS) in patients with radically resected stage III colon cancer
* To evaluate the safety profiles of the treatment groups

Tertiary Objectives

* For patients who signed a specific informed consent, blood and tumour tissue samples will be stored, registered, and centralized in a data bank for translational research projects that will be further determined according to the literature and scientific knowledge at the time of the end of inclusion. (exploratory)
* An economic evaluation at the country level will be conducted alongside the clinical evaluation. (exploratory)

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to center, T stage (1 or 2 vs 3 vs 4), N stage (1 vs 2), performance status (0 vs 1 vs 2), and age (\< 70 years vs â‰¥ 70 years). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

* Arm I: Patients receive modified FOLFOX 6 comprising oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours, leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours, and fluorouracil IV over 46 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days for 6 courses (3 months).
* Arm II: Patients receive modified FOLFOX 6 as in arm I. Treatment repeats every 14 days for 12 courses (6 months).

Blood and tumor samples may be collected at baseline for pharmacogenetic and other analyses.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 8 years.
