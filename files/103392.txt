IAH0968 in Combination With GC for the Treatment of HER2-Positive Unresectable Advanced/Metastatic Malignant Tumors
The study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of IAH0968 in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin for the treatment of HER2-positive unresectable advanced/metastatic malignant tumors and cholangiocarcinoma. The study is divided into two stages: Phase Ib, an open-label, non-randomized, multicenter dose-escalation trial, and Phase II, a randomized, double-blind, parallel-controlled, multicenter trial.

Phase Ib is an open-label, non-randomized, multicenter dose-escalation trial. It utilizes the classic "3+3" design to investigate the safety and tolerability of IAH0968 in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin for the treatment of HER2-positive unresectable advanced/metastatic malignant tumors and cholangiocarcinoma.

Phase II study is a randomized, double-blind, parallel-controlled, multicenter research design. It aims to investigate the efficacy of IAH0968 in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin for the treatment of HER2-positive unresectable advanced/metastatic malignant tumors and cholangiocarcinoma.
