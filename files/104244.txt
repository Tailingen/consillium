Pegylated Interferon ALFA-2b in Children With Juvenile Pilocytic Astrocytomas and Optic Pathway Gliomas
This is a phase II study of the drug, pegylated interferon alfa-2b (PEG-Intron), used to treat brain tumors in a pediatric population. Researchers want to see if treatment with PEG-Intron will stop tumor growth for patients with juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas or optic pathway gliomas.

The purposes of this study are:

* To learn more about the response to pegylated interferon
* To learn more about the side effects of pegylated interferon
* To learn more about MRI images in patients with Juvenile Pilocytic Astrocytomas or Optic Pathway Gliomas.
* To learn more about quality of life in patients treated with pegylated interferon

Number of Children Responding to Treatment, The objective response of study participants was categorized as complete response, partial response, or stable disease. Determination of tumor response or progression is based on the pre-study baseline scan performed closest to time of study entry. The overall response assessment takes into account response in both target and non-target lesion, and the appearance of new lesions. Complete response is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions and non-target lesions, and no new lesions. Partial response is defined as ≥ 65% decrease in the sum of the products of the three perpendicular diameters of all target lesions, and no development of new lesions. Stable disease is defined as neither sufficient decrease in the sum of the products of the three perpendicular diameters of all target lesions to qualify for partial response, nor sufficient increase in a single target lesion to qualify for progressive disease, as well as no new lesions., Month 12
Number of Participants Meeting Event Free Survival Criteria, Event free survival is the time to treatment failure from the time of study enrollment to tumor progression, tumor recurrence, death from any cause or occurrence of a second malignant neoplasm., Month 12, Month 24|Number of Participants Meeting Overall Survival Criteria, Overall survival is measured as the time from study enrollment to death from any cause., Month 12, Month 24
Low grade gliomas are the most common pediatric central nervous system malignancies and can occur in different parts of the brain. Patients who undergo gross total resection, usually those with hemispheric tumors, have an excellent prognosis with surgical resection alone. Patients for whom gross total resection is not achievable have a significant risk of disease progression. Therefore, these patients benefit from adjuvant therapy. Multiple chemotherapy regimens have shown some efficacy in residual tumor, but more than 50% of patients experience recurrences. Radiation has been shown to be an effective therapy in the treatment of these tumors. Because of concerns regarding radiation toxicity especially in young children, and progression despite chemotherapy, novel approaches are needed. This protocol represents an attempt to measure the efficacy and safety of use of pegylated interferon for patients with recurrent, refractory Juvenile Pilocytic Astrocytomas (JPA) or optic pathway gliomas. It provides a different approach to the commonly used treatment modalities. The objectives of this study are to determine the response of children with chemotherapy-refractory progressive JPA or optic pathway gliomas (OPG) to weekly pegylated interferon alpha-2b. The secondary objectives include to better identify the toxicities of weekly pegylated interferon alpha-2b (PEG-Intron™) in pediatric patients with unresectable, refractory, recurrent JPAs or optic pathway gliomas, to evaluate various magnetic resonance imaging techniques for noninvasive monitoring of metabolic and biologic changes in the tumors and to evaluate the quality of life for patients with recurrent, refractory JPAs who receive therapy with pegylated interferon alpha-2b (PEG-Intron™).

The primary end point is to determine the response rate. A two-stage design has been selected to evaluate the response rate. If the treatment demonstrates at least a 25% response rate, the researchers would consider it a promising regimen for further study. A response rate less than 5% is considered evidence of unpromising regimen. Seventeen evaluable pediatric patients with JPA or OPG will be accrued. If at least 3 responders are seen among the 17 patients, this will be considered evidence of a promising response rate for further evaluation.
