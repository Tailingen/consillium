Study to Evaluate the Efficacy, Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamic Effects of PQR309 in Glioblastoma Patients
PQR309 is an oral, dual pan-PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase phosphoinositide 3-kinase) and mTOR (mammilian target of rapamycin) inhibitor that penetrates the blood-brain barrier at pharmacodynamically active concentrations. This study plans to evaluate PQR309 in treatment of patients with first progression of glioblastoma.

Open-label, non-randomized, two-stage, multi-center study evaluating clinical efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic effects of PQR309 in patients with progressive glioblastoma during or after standard temozolomide chemoradiotherapy.

The first stage of the study will enroll a minimum of 18 patients with glioblastoma at first progression during or after temozolomide chemoradiotherapy or temozolomide only. Following the completion of recruitment of patients in the first stage of the study, the decision will be made by the study team (study investigators and the sponsor), based on the continuous evaluation of safety and efficacy data, whether to continue recruitment of patients in the second stage while awaiting the data analyses. 17 additional patients may be enrolled for the second stage of the study, for a minimum of 35 patients in total. All patients evaluable for the primary endpoint will be followed until disease progression or death.
