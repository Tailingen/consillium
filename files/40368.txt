PET-guided External Beam Radiotherapy in Differentiated Thyroid Cancer
Description of the role of a post-operative external beam radiotherapy in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer.
Differentiated Thyroid Cancer
Progression free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) after radiotherapy is evaluated with CT-scan and 18F FDG PET-scan. Also laboratory tests are performed (HTG serum level evaluation in case of biochemical recurrence)., 6 months
toxicities, Acute and late toxicities after radiotherapy are assessed with CTCAE v. 4.03 and EORTC-RTOG scales, respectively., 6 months
The role of post-operative external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) in differentiated thyroid cancer is still discussed considering the low clinical aggressiveness and the availability of ablative 131Iodine therapy. However, there is a subgroup of tumors which lose the ability to capture Iodine over time. This study wants to describe the role of a post-operative external beam radiotherapy in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer.
