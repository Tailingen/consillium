Evaluating Positron Emission Mammography Imaging of Suspicious Breast Abnormalities
The goal of this pilot project is to test the new Radialis Positron Emission Mammography (R-PEM) system in breast cancer patients that has a higher sensitivity with lower radiation doses than conventional PET/CT.

The plan for the pilot study is to image patients who are already scheduled for diagnostic imaging for breast cancer after a positive core biopsy. Participants will be injected with 5mCi (millicurie) of F18-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and patient will wait for a couple of hours for uptake of FDG. After this time, the first R-PEM scan will occur. Additional optional R-PEM scans can be performed 4 hours after injection and 7 hours after injection with reductions in radiation emission.

Additionally, R-PEM images will be compared to standard-of-care breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) to study extension of disease and screening of contralateral breast.

DEVICE: Performance of R-PEM
Evaluating Performance of the R-PEM system as the Dose Decays, The diagnostic performance of R-PEM including sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values compared to magnetic resonance imaging, digital breast tomosynthesis mammography, and digital mammography in characterization of suspicious breast abnormalities will also be evaluated in our study when those images are available through standard patient care., 2 years
