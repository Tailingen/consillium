Effect of Prehabilitation During the Conversion Therapy on Postoperative Outcomes in Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This is a prospective, randomised controlled clinical trial to study the impact of prehabilitation on postoperative complications, physical function, quality of life, and short-term survival outcomes in patients with unresectable liver cancer undergoing conversion therapy.
Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)|Prehabilitation
BEHAVIORAL: Prehabilitation|BEHAVIORAL: Routine nursing measures
Complication Composite Index (CCI) at 30 days postoperatively, Surgical patients were scored based on the severity and number of complications that occurred within 30 days after surgery., 30 days after surgery
30-Day Postoperative Mortality Rate, The 30-day postoperative mortality rate refers to the proportion of patients who die within 30 days following surgery. This rate was recorded separately for patients in both groups who underwent the surgical procedure., 30 days after surgery|Six-Minute Walk Distance (6MWD), In a flat, straight corridor, a 6-minute walk test is conducted to measure the total distance covered on foot., Baseline, each cycle of therapy, the time of surgery, and at 2、6 weeks and 6 months postoperatively.|The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) Score, The EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire, comprising 30 items, is meticulously structured into multiple dimensions or domains to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the quality of life in cancer patients. Patients respond to each item based on their personal circumstances, with each item assigned a specific scoring range, typically from 0 to 4 points (or 0 to 3 points, depending on the particular configuration of the item)., Baseline, each cycle of therapy, the time of surgery, and at 2、6 weeks and 6 months postoperatively|The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7) Score, The Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale consists of seven items, each of which is associated with symptoms of anxiety. These items include feelings of being nervous, anxious, or on edge; not being able to stop or control worrying; worrying too much about various things; finding it hard to relax; being restless due to unease; becoming easily annoyed or irritable; and feeling afraid as if something awful might happen. Patients respond to each item based on their personal circumstances., Baseline, each cycle of therapy, the time of surgery, and at 2、6 weeks and 6 months postoperatively|The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) Depression Scale Score, The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) comprises nine items, each addressing a distinct facet of depressive symptoms. The total score is derived by aggregating the scores from each individual item based on the respondent's chosen answers., Baseline, each cycle of therapy, the time of surgery, and at 2、6 weeks and 6 months postoperatively|The incidence and severity of postoperative complications., During the course of this study and throughout the follow-up period, the severity of postoperative complications in patients who underwent surgery in both groups will be graded and assessed according to the Clavien-Dindo classification system, with all occurrences and degrees of severity of complications being documented., 30 days after surgery|Adverse Events Related to Conversion Therapy, During the course of this study and throughout the follow-up period, the severity of adverse events will be graded and assessed according to the NCI-CTCAE 5.0. All occurrences of adverse events (AEs), treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs), and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be documented, including their incidence, severity, and correlation with the study medication. Additionally, the number and proportion of subjects who discontinue treatment due to these adverse events will be recorded., Up to approximately 2 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective Response Rate (ORR) is a term used in oncology to describe the proportion of patients who experience a complete or partial reduction in their tumor burden in response to treatment. This measure includes both complete responses (CR) and partial responses (PR), and is an important endpoint in assessing the efficacy of cancer therapies., Up to approximately 2 years|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), The time from the initiation of the conversion treatment protocol to the occurrence of tumor progression (in any aspect) or death (for any reason)., Up to approximately 2 years
