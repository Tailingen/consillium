Study to Test the Value of a Pain Modulation Test in Predicting Persistent Postoperative Pain After Breast Cancer Surgery
The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that a preoperative test of pain modulation predicts persistent pain 4 months after breast cancer surgery. In addition, a risk score for the prediction of persistent pain will be developed from parameters available before surgery.
