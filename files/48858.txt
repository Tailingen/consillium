T Cell Receptor Immunotherapy Targeting NY-ESO-1 for Patients With NY-ESO-1 Expressing Cancer
Background:

The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Surgery Branch has developed an experimental therapy for treating patients with cancer that involves taking white blood cells from the patient, growing them in the laboratory in large numbers, genetically modifying them, and then giving the cells back to the patient. In a previous study the NCI Surgery Branch used the anti-ESO-1 gene and a type of virus (retrovirus) to make these tumor fighting cells (anti-ESO-1 cells). About half of the patients who received this treatment experienced shrinking of their tumors. In this study, we are using a slightly different method of producing the anti-ESO-1 cells which we hope will be better in making the tumors shrink.

Objectives:

The purpose of this study is to see if these tumor fighting cells (genetically modified cells) that express the receptor for the ESO-1 molecule on their surface can cause tumors to shrink and to see if this treatment is safe.

Eligibility:

- Patients 15 years old and older with cancer that has the ESO-1 molecule on their tumors.

Design:

* Work up stage: Patients will be seen as an outpatient at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) clinical Center and undergo a history and physical examination, scans, x-rays, lab tests, and other tests as needed
* Leukapheresis: If the patients meet all of the requirements for the study they will undergo leukapheresis to obtain white blood cells to make the anti ESO-1 cells. {Leukapheresis is a common procedure which removes only the white blood cells from the patient.}
* Treatment: Once their cells have grown the patients will be admitted to the hospital for the conditioning chemotherapy, the anti-ESO-1 cells and aldesleukin. They will stay in the hospital for about 4 weeks for the treatment.
* Follow up: Patients will return to the clinic for a physical exam, review of side effects, lab tests, and scans about every 1-3 months for the first year, and then every 6 months to 1 year as long as their tumors are shrinking. Follow up visits take up to 2 days.

Percentage of Participants With a Response, Percentage of patients who have a clinical response (complete response or partial response) to treatment (objective tumor regression). Response was determined entirely by radiographic imaging using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.0 to compare target lesions in centimeters. Complete Response is defined as disappearance of all target lesions. Partial Response is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD., 6 and 12 weeks after cell infusion, then every 3 months x3, then every 6 months x 2, then per principal investigator (PI) discretion, up to five years or disease progression.
Percentage of T Cell Receptor (TCR) in Cluster of Differentiation 3 (CD3) + Cells, T Cell Receptor (TCR) and vector presence will be quantitated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) samples using established polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques., 3 and 6 months, and 1 year post cell administration
Number of Participants With Serious and Non-serious Treatment Related Adverse Events Assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.0), Here is the count of participants with serious and non-serious adverse events assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.0). A non-serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence. A serious adverse event is an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that results in death, a life-threatening adverse drug experience, hospitalization, disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, congenital anomaly/birth defect or important medical events that jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the previous outcomes mentioned., Date treatment consent signed to approximately 6 weeks following cell administration.

Background:

* We have constructed a single retroviral vector that contains both and \<= chains of a murine T cell receptor (mTCR) that recognizes the New York Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma-1 (NY-ESO-1) (ESO) tumor antigen, which can be used to mediate genetic transfer of this T-cell receptor (TCR) with high efficiency.
* In co-cultures with human leukocyte antigen serotype within the HLA-A serotype group (HLA-A2) and ESO double positive tumors, anti-ESO mTCR transduced T cells secreted significant amounts of Interferons (IFN)- \>= with high specificity.

Primary objective:

- To determine whether the administration of anti-ESO mTCR-engineered peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) plus high-dose aldesleukin following a non-myeloablative lymphoid depleting preparative regimen may result in objective tumor regression in patients with metastatic cancers including melanoma expressing the ESO antigen.

Eligibility:

* Age greater than or equal to 15 years and less than or equal to 70 years. Patients aged 15-17 years must weigh at least 50 kg.
* HLA-A\*0201 positive
* Metastatic cancer including melanoma whose tumors express the ESO antigen
* Previously received and have been a non-responder to or recurred after receiving standard care for metastatic disease
* No contraindications for high-dose aldesleukin administration

Design:

* Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained by leukapheresis will be cultured in the presence of anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (OKT3) and aldesleukin to stimulate T-cell growth.
* Transduction is initiated by exposure of cells to retroviral vector supernatant containing the anti-ESO mTCR genes. This mTCR targets the exact same epitope as the human T-cell receptor (hTCR).
* All patients will receive a non-myeloablative lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine.
* On day 0 patients will receive anti-ESO mTCR gene-transduced PBMC and then begin high dose aldesleukin.
* A complete evaluation of evaluable lesions will be conducted 6 weeks (+/- 2 weeks) following the administration of the cell product.
* The study will be conducted using a phase II optimal design (Simon R, Controlled Clinical Trials 10:1-10, 1989). The objective will be to determine if the combination of high dose aldesleukin, lymphocyte depleting chemotherapy, and anti-ESO TCR-gene engineered lymphocytes is able to be associated with a clinical response rate that can rule out 5% (p0=0.05) in favor of a modest 20% Partial Response (PR) + Complete Response (CR) rate (p1=0.20).
* A total of up to 43 patients may be enrolled (41, plus allowing for up to 2 non-evaluable patients).
