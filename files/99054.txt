This proposed study is a descriptive study of the adult oncology population at the Seton Infusion Center in order to provide information about patient needs and identify areas for further research and resource allocation. The patient reported outcome measures being collected cover the following domains: anxiety, depression, fatigue, physical function, financial toxicity and pain. Patients and caregivers will be informed about the study and given the opportunity to enroll at the time of routine clinic visits at the Dell Seton Medical Center at The University of Texas Seton Infusion Center (SIC). Patients choosing to enroll in the study will be provided informed consent, and then allowed to complete the measures during their clinic visit on an iPad provided by the research staff. After IRB approval for a period of 1-2 months data collection will take place at the SIC clinic at DMS. Upon completion of the measures patients will be asked for an email address and phone number so that a follow up link to survey questions can be sent to them in 3 months.
