Open-label Phase 3 BTK Inhibitor Ibrutinib vs Chlorambucil Patients 65 Years or Older With Treatment-naive CLL or SLL
A Randomized, Multicenter, Open-label, Phase 3 Study of the Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor PCI-32765 versus Chlorambucil in Patients 65 Years or Older with Treatment-naive Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia or Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma
DRUG: Ibrutinib|DRUG: Chlorambucil
PFS (Progression Free Survival), The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of Ibrutinib compared with Chlorambucil based on the independent review committee (IRC) assessment of PFS

Progressive disease according to 2008 IWCLL guidelines was defined as:

* Group A

  * Lymphadenopathy, increase ≥50%
  * Hepatomegaly, increase ≥50%
  * Splenomegaly, increase ≥50%
  * Blood lymphocytes, increase ≥ 50% over baseline
* Group B

  * Platelets counts, decrease of ≥ 50% from baseline secondary to CLL
  * Hemoglobin, decrease of \> 2 g/dL from baseline secondary to CLL, Analysis was conducted when 15 months had elapsed after the last subject was randomized with the cutoff date of 4 May 2015. The median follow-up time is 18 month.
Overall Survival (OS), OS is calculated for all randomized subjects as the duration of time from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause or the date last known alive for subjects who were not known to have died at study closure., Analysis was conducted when 15 months had elapsed after the last subject was randomized with the cutoff date of 4 May 2015. The median follow-up time is 18 month.|ORR (Overall Response Rate), ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved complete response (CR), complete response with incomplete marrow recovery (CRi), nodule partial response (nPR) or PR per IRC assessment. Response criteria are as outlined in the International Workshop on CLL (iwCLL) 2008 criteria with the 2012 iwCLL modification stating that treatment-related lymphocytosis in the setting of improvement in other parameters was not considered as PD and the 2013 iwCLL clarification of criteria for a partial response to therapy., Analysis was conducted when 15 months had elapsed after the last subject was randomized with the cutoff date of 4 May 2015. The median follow-up time is 18 month.|Proportion of Sustained Hemoglobin Improvement, The proportion of subjects who achieved Hemoglobin \>11 g/dL or increase ≥ 2 g/dL over baseline and persisted continuously for ≥56 days (8 weeks) without blood transfusion or growth factors., Analysis was conducted when 15 months had elapsed after the last subject was randomized with the cutoff date of 4 May 2015. The median follow-up time is 18 month.|Proportion of Sustained Hemoglobin Improvement in Subjects With Baseline Anemia, In randomized subjects with baseline hemoglobin ≤ 11 g/dL, the proportion of subjects who achieved Hemoglobin \>11 g/dL or increase ≥ 2 g/dL over baseline persisted continuously for ≥56 days (8 weeks) without blood transfusion or growth factors., Analysis was conducted when 15 months had elapsed after the last subject was randomized with the cutoff date of 4 May 2015. The median follow-up time is 18 month.|Proportion of Sustained Platelet Improvement, The proportion of subjects who achieved platelet \>100 x 10\^9/L or increase ≥50% over baseline and persisted continuously for ≥56 days (8 weeks) without blood transfusion or growth factors., Analysis was conducted when 15 months had elapsed after the last subject was randomized with the cutoff date of 4 May 2015. The median follow-up time is 18 month.|Proportion of Sustained Platelet Improvement in Subjects With Baseline Thrombocytopenia, In randomized subjects with baseline platelet ≤ 100 x 10\^9/L, the proportion of subjects who achieved platelet \>100 x 10\^9/L or increase ≥50% over baseline persisted continuously for ≥56 days (8 wee without blood transfusion or growth factors., Analysis was conducted when 15 months had elapsed after the last subject was randomized with cutoff date of 4 May 2015. The median follow-up time is 18 month.
Study design: This is a randomized, multicenter, open-label, Phase 3 study designed to compare the safety and efficacy of Ibrutinib versus Chlorambucil in treatment-naive patients 65 years or older who have CLL or SLL.

Eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to Treatment Arm A or B:

* Treatment Arm A: Oral Chlorambucil 0.5 mg/kg on Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle; the dose can be increased, if well tolerated, in increments of 0.1 mg/kg on Day 1 of each cycle to a maximum of 0.8 mg/kg; patients receive a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 12 cycles, in the absence of progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity.
* Treatment Arm B: Oral Ibrutinib 420 mg/day Randomization will be stratified on Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (0,1 versus 2); presence of advanced Rai stage (yes/no), advanced being defined as Stages 3-4; and geographic region: US versus non-US.
