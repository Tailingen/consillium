Phase I EGFR BATs in Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma
This is a phase I trial using EGFR Bi-armed Activated T-cells (BATs) in combination with standard of care temozolomide (TMZ) and radiation (RT) in patients with glioblastoma (GBM). The purpose of the study is to determine a safe dose of EGFR BATs when given with standard of care therapy.
Glioblastoma|Glioblastoma Multiforme
DRUG: EGFR BATs with TMZ following SOC RT/TMZ|DRUG: Weekly EGFR BATs following SOC RT/TMZ
Maximum tolerated dose, Maximum tolerated dose will be based on number of dose limiting toxicities at each dose level, The study will not advance to the next dose until 7 days after the last patient in the cohort completes his or her second infusion of EGFR BATs
Immune measures in blood- cellular phenotype, Sequential monitoring of cellular phenotype, Before surgery (optional), during screening, at apheresis, at multiple timepoints during study treatment, following completion of study treatment, and every 2-6 months after completion of EGFR BATs infusions through 1 year after last EGFR BATs infusion|Immune measures in blood- interferon-γ, Sequential monitoring of interferon-γ, Before surgery (optional), during screening, at apheresis, at multiple timepoints during study treatment, following completion of study treatment, and every 2-6 months after completion of EGFR BATs infusions through 1 year after last EGFR BATs infusion|Immune measures in blood- EliSpots, Sequential monitoring of EliSpots, Before surgery (optional), during screening, at apheresis, at multiple timepoints during study treatment, following completion of study treatment, and every 2-6 months after completion of EGFR BATs infusions through 1 year after last EGFR BATs infusion|Immune measures in blood- anti-GBM cytotoxicity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells directed at GBM cell lines, Sequential monitoring of anti-GBM cytotoxicity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells directed at GBM cell lines, Before surgery (optional), during screening, at apheresis, at multiple timepoints during study treatment, following completion of study treatment, and every 2-6 months after completion of EGFR BATs infusions through 1 year after last EGFR BATs infusion|Immune measures in blood- serum cytokine patterns, Sequential monitoring of serum cytokine patterns, Before surgery (optional), during screening, at apheresis, at multiple timepoints during study treatment, following completion of study treatment, and every 2-6 months after completion of EGFR BATs infusions through 1 year after last EGFR BATs infusion|Immune measures in blood- anti-GBM antibodies, Sequential monitoring of anti-GBM antibodies, Before surgery (optional), during screening, at apheresis, at multiple timepoints during study treatment, following completion of study treatment, and every 2-6 months after completion of EGFR BATs infusions through 1 year after last EGFR BATs infusion|Clinical response, Progression-free survival (PFS), Every 3 months following last study visit until death or study closure, expected within 5 years|Survival, Overall Survival (OS), Every 3 months following last study visit until death or study closure, expected within 5 years|Response Rate, Objective Response Rate, Every 3 months following last study visit until death or study closure, expected within 5 years|Correlation of imaging to PFS and OS, Imaging (extent of resection) will be evaluated for correlation with PFS and OS., Up to 12 months after study treatment completion|Correlation of pathology to PFS and OS, EGFR expression and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and age will be evaluated for correlation with PFS and OS., Up to 12 months after study treatment completion|Correlation of clinical response to PFS and OS, Steroid use at the time of leukapheresis and age will be evaluated for correlation with PFS and OS., Up to 12 months after study treatment completion|Correlation of immune response to PFS and OS, Immune response characteristics will be evaluated for correlation with PFS and OS., Up to 12 months after study treatment completion|Adverse events, including dose limiting toxicities, Safety of 8 weekly doses of BATs in unmethylated MGMT patients without adjuvant temozolomide, Through 30 days following last dose of EGFR BATs
In addition to finding the safe dose of EGFR BATs, immune evaluations will be performed as delineated in the schedule of events to measure immune responses during all stages of treatment for GBM.
