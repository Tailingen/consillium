RCT of Uniport VATS for Lung Cancer
Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) has been widely used for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) for nearly two decades. Usually, it was applied through three ports with at least one drainage after surgery, which often lead to acute chest pain. Therefore, fewer, smaller ports, and wider intercostal space for surgery has been required.

Uniport VATS became a feasible option with the development of surgical techniques and instruments, with potentially less postoperative pain and shorter hospital stays. However, there may be some complications, or with a longer time of operation, even more difficult in lymph nodes resection during learning curve.

In our study, a Randomized Controlled Trial was designed to study the operation time, perioperative blood loss, conversion rate, duration of postoperative drainage, length of hospital stay, visual analogue score of postoperative pain, complications, and survival.
