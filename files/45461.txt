Non Inferiority Trial of Standard RT Versus Hypofractionated Split Course in Elderly Vulnerable Patients With HNSCC
Randomized comparison between standard radiotherapy and hypofractionated split course schedule. Compared to standard radiotherapy, the investigators expect that hypofractionated split course (interruption of 2 weeks) radiotherapy will improve compliance to treatment, acute tolerance of treatment, preservation of autonomy, prevention of malnutrition, with the same efficacy, measured by the locoregional control rate.
