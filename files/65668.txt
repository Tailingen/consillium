Evaluate Cardiac Function Using Cardiac MRI and Dosimetric Correlation
The association between radiation exposure and cardiac disease is well recognized, it is not fully understood if there exists an optimal or "safe" radiation dose-volume relationship.
Node Positive Breast Cancer
RADIATION: Radiation therapy groups
Cardiac MRI Parameters, Cardiac MRI parameters include Left Ventricular (LV) ejection fraction, LV mass (indexed), LV dimensions, extracellular volume (ECV), and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE)., day of MRI scan
Correlate Cardiac MRI Parameters, Correlate cardiac MRI parameters with pre-treatment heart imaging and cardiac dose volume constraints as a measure of cardiac injury after partial heart irradiation in women with node positive breast cancer treated with surgery, anthracycline-based chemotherapy and regional nodal irradiation., the day of MRI
Dose-volume Constraints for the Heart During Radiation Therapy for Breast Cancer., Trial data will improve the understanding of cardiac function after radiotherapy and allow oncologists to start to define safe dose-volume constraints for the heart in women treated with regional nodal irradiation for breast cancer., The day of the MRI
Identification of "safe" dose volume constraints (DVC) for the heart from breast cancer radiotherapy would permit maximal oncologic benefit from radiation, identifying which patients require more complicated and resource consumptive radiation methods such as respiratory-gating or intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and establish patients who need targeted follow-up for their long term cardiac risk. Two recent technical developments now make it conceivable to identify the dose-volume relationship between heart dose and subsequent cardiac event risk: 1. CT based three dimensional conformal radiation delivery methods (3DCRT) where the precise radiation dose to any given heart volume is known, and 2. Cardiac MRI (CMR) that is more sensitive to prior methods of cardiac evaluation (e.g. SPECT) for detecting and measuring cardiac injury.

An MRI, subject health questionnaire, clinical and dosimetric data will be included in the analysis.
