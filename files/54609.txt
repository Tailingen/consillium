AEs and SAEs, Incidence, severity and drug correlation of AEs and SAEs, All aes and saes are to be collected from the time the pre-screened informed consent is signed until 54 weeks after cell retransfusion, unless the subject withdraws from the study early for any reason
ORR, The proportion of subjects receiving a confirmed optimal response of PR or above which was evaluation according to RECIST or iRECIST principles., Two years|DCR, The proportion of subjects whose response was assessed as CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) to the total number of subjects for which response could be assessed, Two years|DOR, The first assessment of efficacy was CR or PR up to PD or the time of death from any cause, Two years|PFS, The time from the beginning of preconditioning until disease progression (PD) or death from any cause, Two years|OS, The time from the subject's pre-treatment until death from any cause, Two years
The study was divided into two phases, the dose-range exploration study and the expanded enrollment study.

Exploration of the dosage range phase and the expanded enrollment phase were designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and initial efficacy of TAL-T cell therapy in patients with advanced solid tumors
