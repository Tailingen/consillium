AXT1003-1102 is a multicenter, open-label, Phase I safety study of AXT-1003 in patients with advanced malignancies. It is designed to observe the safety of AXT-1003 in patients with advanced malignancies, determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile, and explore the preliminary antitumor activity.
