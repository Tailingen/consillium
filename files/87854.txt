A First-in-human, Clinical Trial Assessing the Safety of ES2B-C001-S01 With or Without [Adjuvant] in Patients With HER2 Expressing Metastatic Breast Cancer.
The trial is a first-in-human, phase I, open-label, dose-escalating trial to assess the safety and tolerability of ES2B-C001 combined with or without \[adjuvant\], in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expressing metastatic breast cancer.
