Direct-acting Antivirals and Hepatocellular Carcinoma Recurrence
Background and Aims: Arrival of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents against hepatitis C virus (HCV) with high-sustained virological response (SVR) rates and very few side effects has drastically changed the management of HCV infection. The impact of DAA exposure on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence after a first remission in patients with advanced fibrosis remains to be clarified.

Methods: 68 consecutive HCV patients with a first HCC diagnosis and under remission, subsequently treated or not with a DAA combination, were included. Clinical, biological, and virological data were collected at first HCC diagnosis, at remission and during the surveillance period.

Hepatocellular recurrence event, The primary outcome (hepatocellular recurrence event) is evaluated using imaging surveillance data at different time points during follow-up (every 3 months within the first year following HCC remission and every 3 to 6 months thereafter) after the first HCC remission., From date of HCC remission until the date of HCC recurrence, assessed up to January 1st, 2017
