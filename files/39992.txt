Study of Anti-tumour Effects and Safety of Prolarixâ„¢ in Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This an open-label study designed to evaluate the anti-tumour activity and safety of Prolarix in subjects with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.

Prolarix is a chemotherapy comprised of tretazicar as prodrug and caricotamide as co-substrate for the endogenous enzyme, NQO2.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: Prolarix (tretazicar co-administered with caricotamide)
Overall Best Tumor Response Rate (Proportion of Subjects With Complete or Partial Response) as Defined by Modified RECIST, every 6 weeks until progression
Disease Control Rate Defined as the Proportion of Subjects With Either Complete or Partial Response or Stable Disease, Approximately 12 weeks or more after first treatment with Prolarix|Time to Tumour Progression, Every 3 weeks until progression|Post-treatment Changes in the Amount of Contrast-enhancing and Non-contrast-enhancing Tumour, Every 6 weeks until progression|Changes in Alpha Fetoprotein, Baseline, every 3 weeks until progression|Adverse Events, Until progression|Changes in Laboratory Measurements, Baseline and every 3 weeks until progression
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the anti-tumour effects of treatment with Prolarix in subjects with advanced HCC (Child-Pugh A and B only).

All subjects will receive an IV infusion of Prolarix once every 21 days until disease progression is observed.

Subjects will have CT scans for tumour measurements before starting treatment with Prolarix and every 6 weeks until disease progression.

Subjects will undergo evaluation for safety (adverse events, vital signs, clinical laboratory measurements, weight, ECG) every 21 days until disease progression.
