Study to Evaluate Concordance of Detecting EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) Mutation by Circulating Tumour Free DNA Versus Tissues Biopsy in NSCLC (Non-small Cell Lung Cancer).
This is a multicentre, prospective, study of EGFR )Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) mutation status in advanced NSCLC (Non-small cell lung cancer)patients (locally advanced and/or metastatic disease) with adenocarcinoma histology proposed to be conducted at 15 sites from different geographical regions across India. The study targets to enrol 268 patients over a period of 6 months.
NSCLC (Non-small Cell Lung Cancer)
Determine the level of concordance between EGFR mutation status, by tissue and plasma based testing in terms of Overall Concordance, Sensitivity, specificity, Positive predictive value \& negative predictive value., 1 Day
Assess the frequency of T790M mutation among study patients., Frequency and percentage of TKI treatment naïve NSCLC patients with T790M mutation will be provided., 1 Day
This is a multicentre, prospective, study of EGFR mutation status in advanced NSCLC patients (locally advanced and/or metastatic disease) with adenocarcinoma histology proposed to be conducted at 15 sites from different geographical regions across India. The study targets to enrol 268 patients over a period of 6 months. The study will enroll patients with histologically confirmed, systemic treatment naïve adenocarcinoma metastatic cancer (stage IV). This will be a single visit study. No study medication will be prescribed or administered as a part of study procedure.
