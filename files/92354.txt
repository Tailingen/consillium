Efficacy-Safety-Immunogenicity Study of CBT124&EU-sourced Avastin® in Stage 4 NSCLC
The purpose of this study is to determine whether CBT124 and Avastin® are comparable in terms of efficacy, safety, immunogenicity; and whether the pharmacokinetics of CBT124 matches that of Avastin® (pharmacokinetics is nested in this study for Indian patients).

Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective Response Rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) criteria (version 1.1). Defined as the proportion of subjects whose best confirmed overall response over Week 1 to Week 19 is either Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR). Confirmed best overall response (complete or partial response) may be claimed only if the criteria for each are met after a repeat radiologic tumor assessment (using RECIST criteria version 1.1) 6 weeks later., 19 weeks

The purpose of this study is to determine whether CBT124 and Avastin® are comparable in terms of efficacy, safety, immunogenicity; and whether the pharmacokinetics of CBT124 matches that of Avastin® (pharmacokinetics is nested in this study for Indian patients). To test the clinical equivalence in terms of efficacy and safety, a two-sided test approach based on a pre-specified range to test the null hypothesis that the proposed biosimilar is either (1) inferior to the reference product or (2) superior to the reference product based on the pre-specified equivalence margin will be used. The equivalence margins are chosen to enable detection of clinically meaningful differences in effectiveness between CBT124, candidate biosimilar bevacizumab and reference product (EU-sourced Avastin®) at the 95% confidence interval (CI). In this trial, asymmetric equivalence margins will be used, i.e., the upper (superiority) and the lower (inferiority) bounds of the equivalence margin are not symmetric. The goal is to reject the null hypothesis of non-equivalence and accept the alternative hypothesis that the two treatments (in this case, CBT124 and EU-sourced Avastin®) are equivalent (i.e., the differences between the two are not clinically and statistically meaningful). The hypothesis testing will be performed by determining if the difference in the primary end point (Objective Response Rate \[ORR\]) between the reference product (EUsourced Avastin®) and proposed biosimilar (CBT124) is within the equivalence margin at the 95% CI.
