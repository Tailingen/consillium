Neoadjuvant Pembrolizumab, Carboplatin and Paclitaxel in Triple-negative Breast Cancer
This is a phase II, single-centered, open-label, single-armed study in patients with early triple-negative breast cancer that will evaluate the pathological complete response (pCR) rate of a non-anthracycline-based chemo-immunotherapy regimen. The trial includes a lead-in cycle of pembrolizumab, then a combination of paclitaxel, carboplatin, and pembrolizumab in the neoadjuvant setting.

Pathological complete response rate (pCR= ypT0/Tis ypN0), The number of patients with pathological complete response (pCR) out of the total number of trial participants using a definition of ypT0/Tis ypN0 after treatment with neoadjuvant pembrolizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin (PCb)., 3 years|Molecular dynamics of cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME), The molecular state of cells in the TME will be measured at a single-cell level using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) before and after one dose of pembrolizumab., 3 years
3-year overall survival (OS) rate, The number of patients that are alive three years after entering the trial out of the total number of trial participants., 5 years|3-year event-free survival (EFS) rate, The number of patients without disease recurrence three years after entering the trial out of the total number of trial participants., 5 years
The cure rate of stage I and II triple-negative breast cancer treated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy is high but comes at the price of substantial toxicity. This is a phase II, single-centered, open-label, single-armed study in patients with early triple-negative breast cancer that will evaluate the pathological complete response (pCR) rate and immune effects of a non-anthracycline-based chemo-immunotherapy regimen. The trial includes a lead-in cycle of pembrolizumab, then a combination of paclitaxel, carboplatin, and pembrolizumab in the neoadjuvant setting.
