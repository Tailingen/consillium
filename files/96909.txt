The Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of KD01 in Cervical Malignancies
The recombinant oncolytic adenovirus injection (KD01) primarily consists of a recombinant human type 5 adenovirus with a deletion in the E3 region, where the ADP gene is replaced by the tBID apoptosis protein gene. This virus exhibits a conditional replication capability, with a 27 base pair deletion in the E1A region corresponding to nucleotides 920-946 of Ad5. This trial is a researcher-initiated clinical study aimed at concurrently evaluating the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of intratumoral administration of KD01 in patients with cervical malignancies.
Cervical Cancer
DRUG: KD01(the recombinant oncolytic adenovirus)
The incidence rates of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Adverse Events (AEs), 5 years|The Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) determined by the incidence rate of Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT)., 5 years
Evaluation of Tumor Microenvironment:, Evaluation of the virus's effect on tumor cell destruction and local immune activation; tumor lesion tissue analysis will include: a) H\&E staining; b) Detection of adenovirus-related markers; c) Assessment of PD-L1 expression levels; d) Analysis of immune cells and immune checkpoint markers such as CD3, CD4, CD8, CD56, CD68, and CD20., 5 years|Local Control (LC) Rate:, Measured via imaging methods for target lesions (injection site lesions). Superficial tumor lesions can be measured with calipers, with the longest diameter measured for non-lymph node lesions and the shortest diameter for lymph nodes., 5 years|Overall Response Rate (ORR):, Evaluated through imaging methods for all tumor lesions (superficial tumor lesions can be measured with calipers) to assess the response and determine the Objective Response Rate (ORR). Efficacy will be evaluated using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. If applicable, the modified RECIST (mRECIST) may serve as a supplementary standard for efficacy evaluation., 1 years|The biological distribution of KD01, The biological distribution of the drug in the patient's blood, urine, feces, saliva, and injection site., 1 years
