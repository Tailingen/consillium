Background

* Although malignant gliomas display genetic heterogeneity, several key proliferation and survival signaling pathways have been identified.
* Recent work has focused on targeting these tumor specific pathways in hopes of improving treatment efficacy and minimizing treatment toxicity. Because molecularly targeted agents have been mostly ineffective when used alone, combination therapy that inhibits multiple pathways is an appealing strategy.
* Sorafenib is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor with effects on tumor proliferation and tumor angiogenesis. Although most GBMs lack rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (RAF) mutations, targeting the RAF/methyl ethyl ketone (MEK)/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway may be beneficial as this pathway may be activated by other genetic alterations upstream from RAF.
* The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) protein is a downstream component of the Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K)/Protein kinase B (Akt) pathway. Everolimus (everolimus; Novartis) is a novel oral derivative of rapamycin.
* Combining everolimus and sorafenib allows targeting of both the PI3K pathway and the RAF-MAPK pathway and in addition targets vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), other active targets in malignant glioma.

Objectives

Phase 1

-To determine the maximum tolerated dose and safety of everolimus in combination with

sorafenib for patients with recurrent malignant gliomas.

Phase 2

* 6 months progression free survival rate for glioblastoma patients with no prior bevacizumab exposure treated with everolimus and sorafenib at the maximum tolerated dose as determined in the phase I study.
* 3 months progression free survival rate for glioblastoma patients with prior bevacizumab exposure treated with everolimus and sorafenib at the maximum tolerated dose as determined in the phase I study.
* 6 months progression free survival rate for Anaplastic Glioma (AG) patients with no prior bevacizumab exposure treated with everolimus and sorafenib at the maximum tolerated dose as determined in the phase I study.

Eligibility

* Patients with histologically proven recurrent intracranial malignant glioma will be eligible for the phase I/II component of this protocol.
* Patients must be \>= 18 years old with a Karnofsky performance status of greater than or equal to 60
* No more than 2 prior chemotherapies and 1 relapse. Prior bevacizumab therapy is allowed.

Design

* This is a phase 1 /2 study of everolimus and sorafenib in patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas.
* Phase 1: Patients will be treated with daily everolimus (days 1-28) in combination with sorafenib.
* Phase 2: Patients will be treated with the combination of sorafenib and everolimus. Sorafenib will be taken daily for 7 days on, then 7 days off. Everolimus will be taken daily.
* There is not a defined set maximum number of cycles that a patient may have. Patients may continue with protocol therapy until criteria for Off Treatment is met. Patients will then be followed every 3 months for survival status.
* There will be an accrual of approximately 3-6 eligible patients per cohort to the Phase I component of the study. Patients removed at any time for toxicity are evaluable. Phase I patients removed from study treatment within 28 days for reasons other than toxicity may be replaced.
* There will be a total accrual of approximately 82 eligible patients to the Phase II study (34 recurrent GBM with no prior exposure to bevacizumab, 16 recurrent Anaplastic Glioma with no prior exposure to bevacizumab, and 32 glioblastoma with prior exposure to bevacizumab).
