NUV-868 as Monotherapy and in Combination With Olaparib or Enzalutamide in Adult Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
NUV-868-01 is a first-in human, open- label, Phase 1/2 dose escalation and expansion study in patients with advanced solid tumors. The Phase 1 and 1b portions include patients with advanced solid tumors and are designed to determine the safety and the dose(s) of NUV-868 to be used as monotherapy and in combination with olaparib or enzalutamide for the Phase 2 portion. In Phase 2, NUV-868 in combination with olaparib or enzalutamide will be given to determine the safety and efficacy of these study treatments. One cohort of patients (with enzalutamide-naïve metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer) will be randomized to receive either NUV-868 monotherapy, enzalutamide monotherapy, or the combination of NUV-868 + enzalutamide. Patients will self-administer NUV-868 orally daily in 28-day cycles as monotherapy in Phases 1 and 2. In Phases 1b and 2, patients will self-administer NUV-868 orally daily in 28-day cycles in combination with olaparib or enzalutamide daily at standard prescribed doses (Phase 1b) or at the recommended Phase 2 combination dose (RP2cD) that is determined in Phase 1b. Patients will be treated until disease progression, toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or termination of the study.
