Use of PET-MR in Head and Neck Cancer Patients - Diagnostic and Therapeutic Applications
The primary research question to be answered in this project is "Are patients with locally-advanced head and neck cancer able to tolerate a PET-MRI scan when they are immobilised in a radiotherapy treatment shell?" This will be assessed by measuring the proportion of patients that complete the full scanning protocol and by obtaining participant feedback on their experience of completing the scan.

The secondary question is "Can a PET-MRI scan fused with a planning CT scan improve the accuracy in radiotherapy planning of patients with head and neck cancer? Accuracy will be assessed by:

1. Comparing the radiotherapy target volumes and radiotherapy plans with and without the use of a PET-MRI scan.
2. Comparing inter- and intra-observer variability in treatment contours with and without the use of a PET-MRI scan within and between oncologists and implications of that.
Head and Neck Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: PET-MRI
Completion of PET-MRI, To assess the proportion of patients completing the full PET-MRI scans when they are immobilised in a radiotherapy treatment shell., 12 months
Impact of additional PET-MRI on radiotherapy target volumes, The secondary objective is to compare the radiotherapy target volumes between conditions (with vs without the use of PET-MRI scan), 12 months|Impact of additional PET-MRI on treatment plan, Assess inter- and intra-observer variability in treatment contours and precision of target delineation in the three categories above (CT, CT-MRI, and CT-PET-MRI scans). This will be assessed using Hausdorff distance in the three categories., 12 months|Impact of additional PET-MRI on treatment plan, Assess inter- and intra-observer variability in treatment contours and precision of target delineation in the three categories above (CT, CT-MRI, and CT-PET-MRI scans). This will be assessed using Dice Similarity Index in the three categories., 12 months
Added benefit to diagnostic investigations, Clinical reports of the PET-MRI scan will be compared to reports from staging MRI and PET-CT scans to determine if any new diagnostic information is brought to light by PET-MRI., 12 months
