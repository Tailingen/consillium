Study of Anti-CD33/CLL1 CAR-NK in Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This is an open-label, nonrandomized, investigator-initiated clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of anti-CD33/CLL1 CAR-NK cell injection in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and to determine PK parameters, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and phase II recommended dose (RP2D) for subjects receiving CAR-NK cell injection.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: Anti-CD33/CLL1 CAR-NK Cells
Incidence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT), To evaluate the safety and tolerability of Anti-CD33/CLL1 CAR-NK cells, 28 days after initial infusion
Overall survival (OS), To evaluate the effectivity of anti-CD33/CLL1 CAR-NK cells, Up to 1 year after infusion|Minimal residual disease (MRD), To evaluate the effectivity of anti-CD33/CLL1 CAR-NK cells, Up to 1 year after infusion|Objective response rate (ORR), To evaluate the effectivity of anti-CD33/CLL1 CAR-NK cells, Up to 1 year after infusion|Duration of overall response (DOR), To evaluate the effectivity of anti-CD33/CLL1 CAR-NK cells, Up to 1 year after infusion|Plasma concentration of CAR-NK cells, Blood samples will be collected at specified time points to detect the number of CAR-NK cells in peripheral blood and to evaluate the PK parameters, One month after the last infusion|Cytokine release, Blood samples will be collected at specified time points to detect the cytokine (IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1ra, IL-10, IL-2, etc.) concentration (pg/mL), One month after the last infusion|Adverse Events (AEs), The incidence and severity of adverse events assessed according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) v5.0, and the correlation between adverse events and CAR-NK cells, From day 1 to day 90 after the last infusion|Percentage of subjects receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), To explore HSCT in subjects receiving CAR-NK cell therapy., Up to 1 year after infusion
The treatment cycle in this study is 28 days. The administration of CAR-NK cells will be performed on day 1 and day 3 of each cycle. Subjects will be treated continuously until the criteria for termination of treatment are met. In this study, the dose escalation design is adopted. The first administration dose in the first cycle is 2.0×10\^9 cells. If no adverse events were observed, the second administration dose in the first cycle would be 3.0×10\^9 cells, and each administration dose in the second cycle and thereafter would be 3.0×10\^9 cells.
