Subclavian Vein catheterization_Seldinger Vs Modified Seldinger
Seldinger technique is a minimally invasive technique in which the practitioner accesses the target vessel with a small bore needle, then dilates to the size required for the catheter. Contrarily, modified Seldinger technique(guiding sheath-over-the-needle technique) use needle that is covered with guiding sheath.

Both technique is widely used in central venous catheterization, however, few researches have been investigated to compare success rate or complications of both methods.

PROCEDURE: Seldinger technique|PROCEDURE: Modified Seldinger technique
Major complication rate of subclavian catheterization, Compare main complication rates of subclavian catheterization including pnumothorax, hemothorax, arterial puncture, malposition of cathter., intraoperative
primary success rate of subclavian catheterization, Check the number of attempts of needling, guidewire advance, and catheterization in both groups., intraoperative|Total insertion time, Check the total insertion time from skin puncture to confirm the successful catheterization via venous aspiration though catheter lumen., From skin puctuation until confim the successful catheterization anticipated within 3min
The major complications of central venous catheterization through subclavian vein, are unintended arterial puncture, pneumothorax, hemothorax, malposition of catheter etc,. We assume that using modified Seldinger technique (MST), guiding sheath is easily slid over the needle, providing stable route into the vessel lumen relatively.

We aimed to compare the Seldinger technique and modified Seldinger technique(MST) on success rate and complications during subclavian central venous catheterization in this prospective, randomized , controlled trials.
