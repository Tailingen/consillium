ABC294640 in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ABC294640 in treating patients with advanced solid tumors. ABC294640 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Please note that the FDA OOPD is participating as a funding source.
Pancreatic Cancer|Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific
DRUG: sphingosine kinase-2 inhibitor ABC294640
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) defined as highest dose of ABC294640 at which 0 or 1 patient of 6 experiences a DLT., MTD defined as the highest dose at which 0 or 1 patient of 6 experiences a DLT. The DLT rate will be estimated with its 95% confidence interval., Patients will be followed until the point in time when no more than 1 of 6 patients has a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) in cycle 1, and expected 54 days.|Safety assessed using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) version 4.0., Assessed using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) version 4.0. Adverse events (AEs) will be coded by body system and summary tables with incidence rates of adverse events will be generated. Descriptive statistics of AEs will be reported by doses and for subsets of patients with serious adverse events (SAEs), patients who discontinue due to AEs, and patients with related AEs., Weekly during course 1, bi-weekly for all subsequent courses, and at the end of treatment study-- expected to occur at an average of 6 months from study start.
Pharmacodynamic parameters for sphingosine kinase-2 inhibitor ABC294640, Area under the drug concentration over time curve (AUC), maximum concentration, minimum concentration, and time to maximum concentration will be calculated for each subject., Days 1 and 28 of cycle 1 collected at prior to dose, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 hours post drug administration.|Pharmacodynamic parameters for sphingosine kinase-2 inhibitor ABC294640, Pharmacodynamic parameters for ABC294640 action will include measurement of plasma levels of S1P, including absolute concentration at each sampling time and chance from baseline concentration at each sampling time after drug administration., Weekly during course 1, bi-weekly for all subsequent courses, and at the end of treatment study-- expected to occur at an average of 6 months from study start.|Tumor response rate, All patients who have measureable disease according to RECIST 1.1, received at least one cycle of treatment, and have had disease re-evaluated will be included., Every 8 weeks till end of treatment study-- expected to occur at an average of 6 months from study start.
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To assess safety and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of ABC294640 (sphingosine kinase-2 inhibitor ABC294640) in patients with solid organ tumors. (Part I) II. To assess the safety and tolerability of ABC294640 at the MTD in an expanded cohort of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. (Part II)

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To establish the dose of ABC294640 recommended for future phase II protocols. (Part I) II. To describe the pharmacokinetics of ABC294640 in patients with solid organ tumors. (Part I) III. To describe the effects of ABC294640 on plasma levels of sphingosine 1-phosphate in patients with solid organ tumors. (Part I) IV. To assess antitumor activity of ABC294640 in patients with solid organ tumors by objective radiographic assessment using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria. (Part I) V. To describe the pharmacokinetics of ABC294640 in HCC patients. (Part II) VI. To describe the effects of ABC294640 on plasma levels of sphingosine 1-phosphate in HCC patients. (Part II) VII. To assess antitumor activity of ABC294640 in HCC patients by objective radiographic assessment using RECIST 1.1 criteria. (Part II)

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

Patients receive sphingosine kinase-2 inhibitor ABC294640 orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly for 1 year.
