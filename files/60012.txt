Lenvatinib Combined Pembrolizumab in Advanced Hepatobiliary Tumors
The investigators design a phase IIB clinical study to explore the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab as a second-line treatment in patients with advanced hepatobiliary malignant tumors and to analyze potential biomarkers of therapeutic response.

This trial is a single-arm, non-randomized and single-center clinical study of targeted therapy combined immunotherapy in patients with hepatobiliary malignant tumors.

It is estimated that 50 patients who met the study criteria will be enrolled in PUMCH and treated with lenvatinib and pembrolizumab. The investigators will follow up and collect subjects' data each month to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment, including overall survival and time to progression. Multi-omics data analysis will be used to find potential biomarkers of treatment response.
