Non Small Cell Lung Cancer|KRAS Gene Mutation
DRUG: Trametinib 0.5 mg|DRUG: Trametinib 1 MG|DRUG: Trametinib 1.5 MG|DRUG: Trametinib 2 mg|DRUG: Ponatinib 15 MG|DRUG: Ponatinib 30 MG
Maximum Tolerated Dose of Ponatinib, Phase I, In the Phase I portion of the study, a standard 3+3 design will be used to find the maximum tolerated dose., maximum of 18 months|Overall Response Rate, In the Phase II portion of the study, RECIST criteria 1.1 will evaluate the overall response rate. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., 1 year
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of the combination of ponatinib and trametinib as well as the most appropriate dosages of the combination.
