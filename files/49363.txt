Cadonilimab Plus Anlotinib for R/M/P Cervical Cancer
The goal of this clinical trial is to test a new treatment combination including cadonilimab, anlotinib and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in recurrent, metastasis and persistent cervical cancer. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* The efficacy of this combination in R/M/P CC;
* The tolerance of this combination in R/M/P CC;
* Possible biomarker of treatment response for this combination.

Participants will receive cadonilimab of 10mg/kg every three weeks at day 1, take anlotinib (12mg) orally in day 1 to day 14, then take a 7 days break and subcutaneously injection of GM-CSF (200ug) from day 1 to day 14, then also take a 7-days break. This treatment will continue until progression or intolerable toxicity or withdraw of participants and it will last for no longer than 2 years.

The prognosis was poor for recurrent, metastasis and persistent cervical cancer especially for those who had multiple lesions and history of previous radiation therapy. KEYNOTE-826 Study demonstrated survival benefit of adding pembrolizumab into the standard first-line treatment for cervical cancer. Here we designed a exploratory clinical study to test a new treatment combination including cadonilimab and anlotinib in recurrent, metastasis and persistent cervical cancer. All participants will receive cadonilimab of 10mg/kg every three weeks at day 1, take anlotinib (8mg) orally in day 1 to day 14, then take a 7-days break and subcutaneously injection of GM-CSF (200ug) from day 1 to day 14, then also take a 7-days break. This treatment will continue until progression or intolerable toxicity or withdraw of participants and it will last for no longer than 2 years.
