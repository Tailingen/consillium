Prospective Trial to Compare ADR of G-EYE™ Colonoscopy With Standard Colonoscopy
The purpose of this study is to compare the adenoma detection rate (ADR) of the G-EYE™ colonoscopy with that of standard colonoscopy.
Adenoma|Polyps|Colorectal Cancer
DEVICE: G-EYE™ Colonoscopy|DEVICE: Standard Colonoscopy
G-EYE™ Colonoscopy detection rate of adenomas and serrated lesions compared to the standard colonoscopy detection rate of the same, Approximately following 14 days (histology results)
Polyp and adenoma detection, The secondary outcome is a composite- each of the measured parameters will be reported as a single value for each arm., Up to 14 days (Histology results)|Procedure times, At time of procedure|Safety (number of patients with adverse events), 48-72 hours
This is a single-center, two-arm , randomized, open-label study intended to compare the detection rate obtained by performing G-EYE™ colonoscopy vs. the detection rate obtained by performing standard colonoscopy.

The study will enroll 350 subjects. Consecutive adult subjects who were referred for elective colonoscopy will be asked to enroll in this randomized clinical study if the candidate meets the study inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Subjects will sign an informed consent form and undergo randomization.
