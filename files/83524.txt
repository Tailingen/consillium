A Study of Avastin (Bevacizumab) in Combination Chemotherapy in Patients With Metastatic Cancer of the Colon or Rectum
A study of Avastin (bevacizumab) in combination chemotherapy in patients with metastatic cancer of the colon or rectum. The anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression.
Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Bevacizumab [Avastin]|DRUG: Capecitabine|DRUG: Irinotecan
Percentage of Participants With Disease Progression or Death, Disease progression was defined according to National Cancer Institute (NCI) guidelines and best clinical practices., Randomization, Weeks 3, 6 and 9, and every 3 months up to 5 years or Death|Time to Progression (TTP), TTP is defined as the time from date of randomization until objective tumor progression or death due to any cause. It includes deaths and thus can be correlated to overall survival., Randomization, Weeks 3, 6 and 9, and every 3 months up to 5 years or Death
Percentage of Participants Who Died, Overall survival is defined as the time from date of randomization until death from any cause, Randomization, Weeks 3, 6 and 9, and every 3 months up to 5 years or Death|Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from date of randomization until death from any cause; Kaplan-Meier estimates were used for analysis., Randomization, Weeks 3, 6 and 9, and every 3 months up to 5 years or Death|Percentage of Participants With Treatment Failure, Treatment failure is defined as discontinuation of treatment for any reason, including disease progression, death, treatment toxicity, insufficient therapeutic response, failure to return, refusing treatment, being unwilling to cooperate and withdrawing consent., Randomization, Weeks 3, 6 and 9, and every 3 months up to 5 years or Death|Time to Treatment Failure, Time to treatment failure is defined as a composite endpoint measuring time from date of randomization to discontinuation of treatment for any reason, including disease progression, death, treatment toxicity, insufficient therapeutic response, failure to return, refusing treatment, being unwilling to cooperate and withdrawing consent. Analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier estimates., Randomization, Weeks 3, 6 and 9, and every 3 months up to 5 years or Death|Percentage of Participants With Progression Excluding Deaths, The failure event was defined as tumor progression excluding deaths due to any reason., Randomization, Weeks 3, 6 and 9, and every 3 months up to 5 years or Death|Time to Progression Excluding Deaths, The failure event was defined as tumor progression excluding deaths due to any reason. Kaplan-Meier estimates were used for analysis., Randomization, Weeks 3, 6 and 9, and every 3 months up to 5 years or Death|Percentage of Participants With Progression Excluding Deaths Not Related to Underlying Cancer, The failure event was defined as tumor progression excluding only deaths not related to underlying cancer., Randomization, Weeks 3, 6 and 9, and every 3 months up to 5 years or Death|Time to Progression Excluding Deaths Not Related to Underlying Cancer, The failure event was defined as tumor progression excluding only deaths not related to underlying cancer. Kaplan-Meier estimates were used for analysis., Randomization, Weeks 3, 6 and 9, and every 3 months up to 5 years or Death|Percentage of Participants by Best Overall Response, Best overall response is defined as the best response recorded from the date of randomization until disease progression or recurrence. Complete response (CR): at least 2 determinations of CR at least 4 weeks apart before progression; Partial response (PR): at least 2 determinations of PR at least 4 weeks apart before progression; Stable disease (SD): at least one SD assessment; Progressive Disease (PD): Disease progression or death due to underlying cancer. CR: Complete disappearance of all target lesions; PR: At least 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of all target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum of all target lesions; PD: At least 20% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of all target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum of longest diameter of all target lesions or the appearance of one or more new lesions; SD: Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for CR or PR or increase in lesions;, Randomization, Weeks 3, 6 and 9, and every 3 months up to 5 years or Death|Percentage of Participants With a Best Overall Response of CR or PR, CR: Complete disappearance of all target lesions; PR: At least 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of all target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum of all target lesions;, Randomization, Weeks 3, 6 and 9, and every 3 months up to 5 years or Death|Percentage of Participants With Stable Disease, Stable disease rate was the proportion of participants who achieved CR, PR, or SD., Randomization, Weeks 3, 6 and 9, and every 3 months up to 5 years or Death|Percentage of Participants With Progressive Disease Within 12 Weeks From Start of Treatment, Early progression was the proportion of participants with progressive disease within 12 weeks from the start of treatment., Randomization, Weeks 3, 6 and 9, and 12|Duration of Overall Response, Duration of overall response included participants who achieved a CR or PR., Randomization, Weeks 3, 6 and 9, and every 3 months up to 5 years or Death|Duration of Stable Disease (SD), Duration of SD was calculated as the number of months the participants remained in CR, PR or SD. Kaplan-Meier estimates were used for analysis., Randomization, Weeks 3, 6 and 9, and every 3 months up to 5 years or Death|Duration of Overall Complete Response, Duration of complete response was calculated as the time in months from the date of randomization to the date of first documentation of CR. Kaplan-Meier estimates were used for analysis., Randomization, Weeks 3, 6 and 9, and every 3 months up to 5 years
