Prospective Validation of the OHI Index
Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) associated with hematologic malignancies (HM-HLH) is a syndrome with an abysmal prognosis (10-30% 5 years overall survival). The investigators have recently established an improved diagnostic and prognostic index for HM-HLH, termed the Optimized HLH Inflammatory (OHI) index. The OHI index is comprised of the combined elevation of soluble CD25 (sCD25) \> 3,900 U/mL and ferritin \>1,000 ng/mL . However, the true incidence and outcomes of HLH/OHI+ in an unselected cohort are unknown, and so is the mechanism of HM-HLH.

To assess 365 days mortality of OHI+ and OHI- patients, The investigators will use Kaplan-Meier curves to compare survival between OHI+ and OHI- patients, Mortality rate one year from OHI assessment
To determine the incidence of OHI+ patients in our cohort, The investigators will assess the incidence of OHI+ within our cohort (OHI+/total patients enrolled), The investigators will assess the incidence after three years of enrollment
The investigators will enroll patients with new/transformed hematologic malignancies. The investigators will follow the patients until the end of the study, report their survival at one year and examine their prognosis.
