An Observational Study Measuring Outcomes in Cancer Patients Treated for Moderate to Severe Hyponatremia in Italy
This observational, prospective, non-interventional study will include cancer patients who need a treatment for hyponatraemia secondary to SIADH. Patients will be prescribed treatment(s) according with the clinical practice regardless of the patient participation in the study. The purpose of this NIS is to collect additional scientific and clinical information that can help in describing the characteristics of cancer patients with hyponatraemia secondary to SIADH, the current management of hyponatremia, the therapies to keep under control serum \[Na+\] and the guidelines for the management of this population in Italy.
Hyponatremia|Syndrome of Inappropriate ADH (SIADH) Secretion|Cancer
Change in serum [Na+], Change in serum \[Na+\] from the baseline visit to the end of the first month or sixth month of the observational period or until earlier discontinuation from the study, 1 month and 6 months
EQ-5D to measure quality of life, Will be assessed at baseline and at subsequent visits (falling within routine clinical practice) until 6 months.

EQ-5D EQ-5D is a standardised measure of health status developed by the EuroQol Group in order to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal., From baseline up to 6 months|EORTC QLQ-C30 to measure quality of life, Will be assessed at baseline and at subsequent visits (falling within routine clinical practice) until 6 months.

EORTC QLC-C30: European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Study Group on Quality of Life has developed the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire consisting in a modular system for assessing the quality of life of cancer patients in clinical research., From baseline up to 6 months|ECOG PS to assess progress of the disease, Will be assessed at baseline and at subsequent visits (falling within routine clinical practice) until 6 months.

The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status is a scale used to assess how a patient's disease is progressing, assess how the disease affects the daily living abilities of the patient, and determine appropriate (oncology) treatment and prognosis., From baseline up to 6 months|Measure of cognitive impairment: mini-mental state examination (MMSE), Will be assessed at baseline and at subsequent visits (falling within routine clinical practice) until 6 months.

The mini-mental state examination (MMSE) or Folstein test is a sensitive, valid and reliable 30-point questionnaire that is used extensively in clinical and research settings to measure cognitive impairment., From baseline up to 6 months|Time to chemotherapy (days), Longitudinal (up to 6 months)|Length of stay (days), Longitudinal (up to 6 months)|Readmission (number of readmissions), will be used to evaluate rate of readmissions among this population, Longitudinal (up to 6 months)|Survival status (%), Will be used to evaluate overall survival (%) among this population after 6 months., 6 months
