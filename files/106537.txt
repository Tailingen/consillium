Phase II Study of Brivanib (BMS-582664) to Treat Multiple Tumor Types
The purpose of this study is to determine if gastric/esophageal, lung, pancreatic, bladder and sarcoma patients show benefit from brivanib treatment. Patients who clearly do, stay on treatment. Those in which it is unclear will be randomized to continue or withdraw treatment to determine whether that benefit is related to brivanib
