Trial of Sunitinib and/or Nivolumab Plus Chemotherapy in Advanced Soft Tissue and Bone Sarcomas
Phase I-II, single-arm, non-randomized, open-label, multicenter, international clinical trial, with two stages. Stage one has two cohorts (soft tissue sarcoma and bone sarcoma) and stage two has eight cohorts (DDCS, EMC, VS, SFT, CCS, ASPS, UPS, LMS and OS). Nine sites in Spain, 3 sites in Italy and 1 site in the United Kingdom.

Stage 1 (PHASE 1 and PHASE 2)

Objective: To determine the recommended dose of the sunitinib plus nivolumab combination for phase II part. To evaluate the efficacy of the sunitinib plus nivolumab combination as measured by the progression-free survival rate (PFSR) at 6 months in patients with advanced soft tissue and bone sarcomas.

Treatment: Adult patients will receive an initial induction phase (IP) from day 1 to day 14 of sunitinib 37.5 mg/day followed by a maintenance phase (MP) of sunitinib 37.5 mg/day continuously + nivolumab 3 mg/kg intravenous every 2 weeks infused over 1 hour. If three or more DLTs occur from day 15 to 42, for an initial set of 10 patients, sunitinib dose will be lowered to 25 mg/day or treatment schedule will be changed to 2 weeks on and one week off until recovery from toxicities.

Stage 2

C1 to 6

Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of the sunitinib plus nivolumab combination as measured by PFSR at 6 months (CS/DDCS, EMC, VS, SFT, CCS cohorts) and at 12 months (ASPS cohort).

Treatment: Adult patients will receive an initial induction phase (IP) from day 1 to day 14 of sunitinib 37.5 mg/day followed by a maintenance phase (MP) of sunitinib 25mg/day continuously + nivolumab 240mg every 2 weeks. Pediatric patients will receive an initial IP from day 1 to day 14 of (\<18 years) sunitinib at 25 mg/day unless the body surface area (BSA) of the patient is \>1.7. If BSA is \>1.7, then sunitinib 37.5 mg/day will be given followed by a MP of sunitinib 25 mg/day continuously + nivolumab 240 mg every 2 weeks regimen (if weight ≥40 kg) or sunitinib 25 mg/day continuously + nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks regimen (if weight \<40kg).

Stage 1

Sample size has been obtained for a one-arm one-stage survival design based on Brookmeyer-Crowley like test. The test statistic for survival probability is assumed to be based on the non-parametric estimate of the survival distribution. For STS 2nd line cohort sample size has been obtained for the primary endpoint progression-free survival rate (PFSR) at 6 months. Estimated accrual time: 24 months. A PFSR of 5% will be considered not promising, whereas a PFSRof 15% will be considered promising in this population. With a type I error α of 0.05 and a power of 0.80, 48 patients are needed in this cohort. For bone sarcoma 2nd line cohort sample size has been obtained under the same assumptions than above, but with a type I error α of 0.10, therefore 38 patients are needed in this cohort.

Stage 2

Cohorts 1-6:

COHORT 1 - Dedifferentiated Chondrosarcoma (DDCS): For DDCS sample size is obtained for the primary endpoint of 6-month progression-free survival rate, estimated accrual 24 months. A 6-m PFSR of 40% will be considered not promising whereas of 70% will be considered promising in this population. With a type I error α of 0.05 and a power of 0.90, 23 patients were estimated in this cohort. With one arm survival design based on survival probability a Brookmeyer-Crowley like test is assumed (Brookmeyer, 1982) \[65\]. If at least 14 cases over the 23 patients have a 6-m PFSR, then further investigation of the experimental treatment is warranted.

COHORT 2 - Extraskeletal Myxoid Chondrosarcoma (EMC): For EMC sample size is obtained for the primary endpoint of 6-month progression-free survival rate, and estimated accrual 24 months. A 6-m PFSR of 50% will be considered not promising whereas of 80% will be considered promising in this population. With a type I error α of 0.05 and a power of 0.90, 22 patients were estimated in this cohort. With Simon's two-stage Minimax design, at least 13 cases over the 20 first patients (stage 1) should have a 6-m PFSR. Then additional 2 patients would be accrued up to 22 patients. If at least 15 patients had a 6-m PFSR, further investigation of the drug is warranted.

COHORT 3 - Vascular sarcomas (VS) (including angiosarcoma, hemangioendothelioma and intimal sarcomas): For VS sample size is obtained for the primary endpoint of 6-month progression-free survival rate, and estimated accrual 24 months. A 6-m PFSR of 30% will be considered not promising whereas of 60% will be considered promising in this population. With a type I error α of 0.05 and a power of 0.90, 23 patients were estimated in this cohort. With Simon's two-stage Minimax design, at least 8 cases over the 18 first patients (stage 1) should have a 6-m PFSR. Then additional 5 patients would be accrued up to 23 patients. If at least 11 patients had a 6-m PFSR, further investigation of the drug is warranted.

COHORT 4 - Solitary Fibrous Tumor (SFT): For SFT cohort sample size is obtained for the primary endpoint of 6-month progression-free survival rate by Choi criteria, and estimated accrual of 24 months. A 6-m PFSR of 35% will be considered not promising whereas of 65% will be considered promising in this population. With a type I error α of 0.05 and a power of 0.90, 24 patients were estimated in this cohort. With Simon's two-stage Minimax design, at least 6 cases over the 14 first patients (stage 1) should have a 6-m PFSR. Then additional 10 patients would be accrued up to 24 patients. If at least 13 patients had a 6-m PFSR, further investigation of the drug is warranted.

COHORT 5 - Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma (ASPS): For ASPS cohort sample size is obtained for the primary endpoint of 12-month progression-free survival rate by RECIST criteria, and estimated accrual 24 months. A 12-m PFSR of 40% will be considered not promising whereas of 75% will be considered promising in this population. With a type I error α of 0.05 and a power of 0.90, 18 patients were estimated in this cohort. With Simon's two stage Minimax design, at least 7 cases over the 12 first patients (stage 1) should have a 12-m PFSR. Then additional 6 patients would be accrued up to 18 patients. If at least 11 patients had a 12-m PFSR, further investigation of the drug is warranted.

COHORT 6 - Clear Cell Sarcoma (CCS): For CCS cohort sample size is obtained for the primary endpoint of 6-month progression-free survival rate by RECIST criteria, and estimated accrual 24 months. A 6-m PFSR of 25% will be considered not promising whereas of 55% will be considered promising in this population. With a type I error α of 0.05 and a power of 0.90, 23 patients were estimated in this cohort. With Simon's two-stage Minimax design, at least 4 cases over the 13 first patients (stage 1) should have a 6-m PFSR. Then additional 10 patients would be accrued up to 23 patients. If at least 10 patients had a 6-m PFSR, further investigation of the drug is warranted. An additional 5-7% of patients may be recruited to compensate for potential unevaluable participants.For the variables that follow binomial distributions, like the PFS rate and for the categorical variables, frequencies and percentages will be calculated as well as their confidence interval. If needed, to compare categorical variables both Chi-square test and Fisher's exact test will be performed. Besides, Kaplan-Meier estimations will be used for PFS. Where possible, exploratory analysis will include Cox models to estimate the impact of several factors on PFS.

Cohort 7: This cohort includes a phase 1b study (3+3 design plus expansion cohorts) and therefore no formal sample size has been calculated. Each subcohort (7a: UPS and 7b: LMS) will include between 10 and 20 patients respectively (including the expansions).

Cohort 8: A phase I/II is planned for this cohort. For the phase I part, the safety of the MAP + nivolumab combination will be assessed using a 3+3 design including 6 patients treated at the recommended phase II dose (RP2D). This phase I could include up to 12 patients approximately. Regarding the phase II part, for osteosarcoma with metastasis at presentation and resectable primary tumor, in patients with less than 40 years, sample size is obtained for the primary endpoint of histological response after 2 MAPs of induction. A proportion of 45% of good histological response (≥90% necrosis) will be considered not promising, whereas 68% will be considered promising in this population. With a type I error α of 0.05 and a power of 0.80, 31 patients were estimated in this cohort. With Simon's two-stage Minimax design, at least 7 cases over the 13 first patients (initial part) should have good histological response. Then, additional 18 eligible patients will be accrued up to 31 patients. If at least 19 patients had good histological response, further investigation of the drug is warranted.
