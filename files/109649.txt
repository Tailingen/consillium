A Phase II Study of Oxaliplatin Capecitabine and Pre-operative Radiotherapy for Patients With Locally Advanced and Inoperable Rectal Cancer
To assess the efficacy and safety of pre-operative capecitabine and oxaliplatin followed by capecitabine with concurrent radiotherapy followed by post-operative capecitabine in the treatment of patients with locally advanced or inoperable rectal cancer.

To assess the efficacy and safety of pre-operative capecitabine and oxaliplatin followed by capecitabine with concurrent radiotherapy followed by post-operative capecitabine in the treatment of patients with locally advanced or inoperable rectal cancer.
