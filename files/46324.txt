Biomarkers in Bone Marrow Samples From Patients With Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia
This research study is studying biomarkers in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia. Studying samples of bone marrow from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and about biomarkers related to cancer.

OBSERVATIONAL STUDY MODEL: Case-only TIME PERSPECTIVE: Retrospective BIOSPECIMEN RETENTION: Samples With DNA BIOSCPECIMEN DESCRIPTION: Bone marrow STUDY POPULATION DESCRIPTION: Primary Care Clinic SAMPLING METHOD: Non-Probability Sample

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To measure WT1 and VEGF-1 expression in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patient mRNA samples from diagnosis are analyzed via quantitative PCR to measure WT1 and VEGF-1 expression.
