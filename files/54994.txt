Adverse events will be summarized for the DLT observation period and the entire treatment period based on the DLT analysis set and the safety analysis set, respectively, and drug-related AEs, SAEs, AEs of toxicity grade ≥3, and AEs leading to discontinuation will be counted. The occurrence of DLT will be assessed specifically for the DLT analysis set., From the first dose to 30 days after the last dose or the initiation of new antitumor therapy (whichever occours first).|Cmax of FCN-338, Pharmacokinetics of FCN-338 by assesment of the maximum plasma concentration, Up to 24 hours postdose|AUC0-t of FCN-338, Pharmacokinetics of FCN-338 by assesment of the Area Under The Plasma Concentration Time Curve From Time 0 To The Time Of The Last Quantifiable Concentration, Up to 24 hours postdose|AUC0-24 of FCN-338, Pharmacokinetics of FCN-338 by assesment of the Area Under The Plasma Concentration Time Curve From Time 0 To The 24 hours postdose, Up to 24 hours postdose|AUC0-∞ of FCN-338, Pharmacokinetics of FCN-338 by assesment of The Plasma Concentration Time Curve From Time 0 To Infinity, Up to 24 hours postdose|Tmax of FCN-338, Pharmacokinetics of FCN-338 by assesment of Time To Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration, Up to 24 hours postdose|t1/2 of FCN-338, Pharmacokinetics of FCN-338 by assesment of Terminal Half-life, Up to 24 hours postdose|CL/F of FCN-338, Pharmacokinetics of FCN-338 by assesment of Apparent Clearance Of Drug From Plasma After Oral Administration, Up to 24 hours postdose|Vd/F of FCN-338, Pharmacokinetics of FCN-338 by assesment of Apparent Volume Of Distribution, Up to 24 hours postdose|Css_max of FCN-338, Pharmacokinetics of FCN-338 by assesment of Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration At Steady State, Up to 24 hours postdose|Css_av of FCN-338, Pharmacokinetics of FCN-338 by assesment of the Average concentration At Steady State, Up to 24 hours postdose|AUCss of FCN-338, Pharmacokinetics of FCN-338 by assesment of the Area Under The Plasma Concentration Time Curve within dosing interval At Steady State, Up to 24 hours postdose|DF of FCN-338, Pharmacokinetics of FCN-338 by assesment of fluctuation, Up to 24 hours postdose|MRT, Pharmacokinetics of FCN-338 by assesment of Mean residence time, Up to 24 hours postdose|Kel of FCN-338, Pharmacokinetics of FCN-338 by assesment of the Terminal rate constant., Up to 24 hours postdose|Css_min of FCN-338, Pharmacokinetics of FCN-338 by assesment of Trough Concentration At Steady State, Up to 24 hours postdose
Primary Objectives:1.To assess the safety and tolerability of FCN-338 in combination with AZA or chemotherapy in patients with myeloid neoplasms. 2. To explore the antitumor activity of FCN-338 combination therapy in patients with myeloid neoplasms.

Secondary Objectives: 1. To assess the pharmacokinetic profile of the FCN-338 combination therapy in patients with myeloid neoplasms.2. To assess the transfusion independence rate in patients with myeloid neoplasms.

There were 2 cohorts based on different combination therapies and different indications.

Cohort A is FCN-338 combined with AZA (75mg/m², SC, QD, D1-7) for the treatment in relapsed/refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients.

Cohort B is FCN-338 combined with intensive chemotherapy for first line (1L) fit AML patients. During the induction phase, patients will be treated with erythromycin (60 mg/m², IV, QD , D1-3) and Ara-C (100 mg/m², IV, QD, D1-7). Patients achieving partial remission (PR) will repeat induction phase once, and patients who do not reach PR after first cycle of induction phase and those who do not achieve complete remission (CR)/Complete remission with incomplete hematological recovery (CRi)/morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS) after two cycles of induction phase will receive other new antitumor treatments. Patients who achieve CR/CRi/MLFS will undergo consolidation phase with medium- to high-dose Ara-C (1 to 3 g/m²/12h, 6 doses) for 3 to 4 cycles, with the exact dose and number of cycles determined by investigator. Patients with intermediate- to high-risk according to the 2017 European Leukemia Net (ELN) stratification will undergo a total of 24 cycles of maintenance phase after completion of consolidation phase. Maintenance phase will consist of 24 cycles, FCN-338 in combination with AZA (50 mg/m², d1-5) for the first 12 cycles and FCN-338 alone for the rest 12 cycles. FCN-338 will be administered once daily (QD), D1-14 per cycle during induction phase, consolidation phase and maintenance phase.
