Endometrial Preparation Before Operative Hysteroscopy in Premenopausal Women
The presence of a thin endometrium has an important role in allowing the best conditions for hysteroscopic surgery. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a 21 day administration of 2 mg of dienogest versus ulipristal acetate 5 mg, in rapid endometrial preparation to operative hysteroscopy.
Uterine Fibroids
PROCEDURE: operative hysteroscopy|DRUG: Dienogest|DRUG: Ulipristal acetate
Endometrial thickness, We perform a transvaginal ultrasound (baseline) and we measure the maximum thickness of endometrial line; at the time of surgery (operative hysteroscopy) we repeat the ultrasound after pharmacological treatment. It will be expressed in mm, Change in mm from baseline after farmacological therapy
Ovarian follicle dimensions, We perform a transvaginal ultrasound (baseline) and we measure the maximum diameter of follicles; at the time of surgery (operative hysteroscopy) we repeat the ultrasound after pharmacological treatment. It will be expressed in mm, Change in mm from baseline after farmacological therapy|Endometrial appearance, We perform a diagnostic hysteroscopy (baseline) and we describe the endometrial appearance; at the time of surgery (operative hysteroscopy) we describe the endometrial appearance after pharmacological treatment, Change from baseline after farmacological therapy|Operative time, It will be expressed in minutes, Within 2 hours after the end of the hysteroscopy
