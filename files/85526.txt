A Study of KW-2478 in Combination With Bortezomib in Subjects With Relapsed and/or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and benefits of the investigational study drug, KW-2478, when given with bortezomib (Velcade®), a drug approved for the treatment of Multiple Myeloma (MM).

The primary objectives:

* To establish the safety, tolerability, and recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of KW-2478 in combination with bortezomib (Phase I);
* To assess the overall response rate (ORR) when subjects with advanced MM are treated (Phase II).

The secondary objectives:

* To characterize the Pharmacokinetic (PK) and Pharmacodynamic (PD) of KW-2478 with bortezomib (Phase I only);
* To evaluate for preliminary evidence of efficacy (Phase I);
* To determine progression free survival (PFS) and duration of response of KW-2478 with bortezomib (Phase II).
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: KW-2478|DRUG: Bortezomib
To Establish the Safety, Tolerability, and RP2D (Phase 1); To Assess the Overall Response Rate in Subjects With Advanced Multiple Myeloma (Phase 2)., The safety of KW-2478 was determined by reported TEAEs, observed DLTs, changes in PEs, vital sign measurements, ECGs, and laboratory analyses.

The ORR, was defined as the best response over a specified number of cycles (calculated and summarized).

Disease control rate (DCR) was defined as the best response over a specified number of cycles (calculated and summarized). Progression-free survival was defined as the time from the first day of treatment until the date of disease progression or death is first reported (calculated and summarized)., 21 day cycle, up to 52 weeks

This is a multicenter, open label, dose escalation, Phase I / II study in subjects with relapsed and/or refractory MM. Up to 24 subjects to be enrolled in the Phase I to determine the RP2D. Up to 77 additional evaluable subjects to be enrolled in Phase II for a maximum up to 101 subjects treated in the study. Study centers in the USA and the UK will participate in Phase I and II. Centers in the Philippines will be participating in Phase II only. The planned enrollment period is 22 months and the planned study duration is 28 months.
