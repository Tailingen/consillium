Bortezomib and Doxil for the Treatment of Patients With Acute Myelogenous Leukemia
The purpose of this study is to determine whether bortezomib in combination with doxil/lipodox is effective in the treatment of Acute Myeloid Leukemia.
Acute Myelogenous Leukemia
DRUG: Bortezomib|DRUG: Doxil
Progression Free Survival, The time from first day of treatment to the first observation of disease progression or death due to any cause. If a patient has not progressed or died, progression-free survival is censored at the time of last follow-up., Up to 2 years
Overall Survival, Overall survival wil be measured as the time from start of treatment to the Date of death or the last date the patient was known to be alive, Up to two years|Toxicity Information Recorded Will Include the Type, Severity, Time of Onset, Time of Resolution, and the Probable Association With the Study Regimen., Toxicity will be evaluated based on the standard NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects CTCAE) V.4.0 grading criteria., Up to two years
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains largely incurable despite advances that have been made in recent years into increasing the complete response (CR) rates. In elderly patients (over the age of 60), CR rates are lower, 40 to 50%, and long term disease-free and overall survival is less than 10%. The therapeutic options for relapsed/refractory AML are significantly limited. Bortezomib has shown promising activity in patients with advanced hematologic malignancies, including those with leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

Given the available data suggesting efficacy of bortezomib in combination with doxil in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma (MM), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and Non Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) as well as the known sensitivity of AML to anthracyclines and in vitro data demonstrating the sensitivity of multiply resistant AML cells to bortezomib, we are proposing the use of this combination in patients with relapsed/refractory AML or elderly patients who are not candidates for standard induction therapy.

Using the subcutaneous formulation of bortezomib would provide patients with reduced neurotoxicity and easier schedule due to decreased time in the infusion room and it would decrease overall cost of care.
