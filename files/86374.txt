A Study of Selicrelumab (RO7009789) in Combination With Atezolizumab in Participants With Locally Advanced and/or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is an open-label, multicenter study designed to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and activity of Selicrelumab administered in combination with Atezolizumab (ATZ) in participants with metastatic or locally advanced solid tumors. The study will be conducted in two Parts (I and II), with Part I divided into Parts IA and IB. All participants will be followed up for survival until death or loss of follow-up after the last visit or withdrawal of consent.
