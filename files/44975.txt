Clinical Impact of EUS in Staging NSCLC
The goal of this prospective study is to determine the clinical and economic impact of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) in staging NSCLC. Aims: 1) Determine the accuracy of EUS in staging NSCLC 2) Measure 5-year survival 3) Measure quality of life in patients that undergo surgery 4) Determine the cost benefit of EUS in staging NSCLC.
