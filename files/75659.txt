A Dose Escalation Study of BIBF 1120 Together With Paclitaxel and Carboplatin in Patients With Advanced Stage Non-small-cell Lung Cancer
The primary objectives of this trial were to determine the MTD of BIBF 1120 in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel, pharmacokinetics and objective response of treatment
