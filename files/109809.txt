Domestic Surgical Robot Clinical Study
Central South University in collaboration with Tianjin University developed the first domestically produced Chinese minimally invasive surgical (MIS) robot system which named "Micro Hand S" in 2013. Recently, as the domestic surgical robot research project's main section, this new MIS robot had been authorized to enter the clinical trial stage by the Ethics Committee of the Third Xiangya Hospital at Central South University.

intraoperative outcomes, surgical procedure/operative time/console time/blood loss/conversion, up to 1 week after operation|postoperative outcomes, Time to first flatus/intake/hospital stay, up to 1 month after operation|pathological outcomes, resection margin/harvested lymph node/mesorectal grade, up to 1 month after operation|complication, type of complication/grade of complication, within 30 days after surgery
functional outcomes, wexner/ipss/iief score, at least12 months after operation|recurrence, local recurrence and metastasis, at least 12 months after operation|survival, disease free survival/overall survival, at least 12 months yesra after operation|change of blood and biochemiacl, wbc/hgb/albumin/cea, within 1 month after operation
One surgeon perform these surgical trials using the robot "Micro Hand S". All of the patients were followed for 12 months, and pre- and postoperative changes in blood route test and hepatorenal function examination, surgery duration, hospital stay, total robotic setup time, total robotic operation time, intraoperative blood loss, total postoperative drainage amount, duration of bearing drainage tubes were recorded. In addition, the pre- and postoperative changes in the pathological and functional outcomes were measured.
