Flat Dose Vs. Weight-based IP Chemotherapy for CRS/HIPEC
Peritoneal carcinomatosis from advanced gastro-intestinal malignancy has historically been associated with poor overall survival (≤ 12 months) with few treatment options. Cytoreductive surgery (CRS), which involves removal of all macroscopic tumor nodules, combined with direct administration of heated intra-peritoneal (IP) chemotherapy (HIPEC) to the affected peritoneal surfaces, has been shown to be an effective treatment option that extends overall survival among certain cases of peritoneal carcinomatosis. IP chemotherapy allows delivery of a high dose of cytostatic drug directly onto the peritoneal surfaces at risk for microscopic residual disease while systemic exposure remains limited. Additionally, hyperthermia is known to enhance the cytotoxicity of several agents (including Mitomycin C) and improves the depth of peritoneal penetration.

This trial will be a randomized phase 2 comparison of flat dose versus weight-based dose Mitomycin C. The hypothesis of this study is that HIPEC weight-based dosing may result in similarly effective peritoneal Mitomycin C concentrations with less systemic absorption and potential systemic toxicity, compared with the HIPEC flat dosing approach in patients undergoing CRS/HIPEC.
Peritoneal Carcinomatosis
DRUG: Mitomycin C, flat dose 40 mg|DRUG: Mitomycin C, weight-based dose 12.5 mg/m2
Area Under the Curve (AUC) - Pharmacokinetics, Drug exposure will be measured by calculating the area under the curve (AUC) or integral of a plasma concentration-time curve. Samples will be collected at 0,15, 30, 60 and 90 minutes intra-operatively, and 2, 4, and 12 hours postoperatively., Approximately 20 hours|Drug Clearance (CL) - Pharmacokinetics, Drug clearance will be calculated as the volume of plasma cleared per unit time. Samples will be collected at 0,15, 30, 60 and 90 minutes intra-operatively, and 2, 4, and 12 hours postoperatively., Approximately 20 hours|Drug Half-Life (T1/2) - Pharmacokinetics, Drug half-life will be calculated as the time required for the plasma Mitomycin C concentration to be half of its maximum concentration. Samples will be collected at 0,15, 30, 60 and 90 minutes intra-operatively, and 2, 4, and 12 hours postoperatively., Approximately 20 hours
