A Clinical Study of MK-2870 Alone or With Chemotherapy to Treat Gastrointestinal Cancers (MK-9999-02A)
Researchers want to learn if sacituzumab tirumotecan (MK-2870) alone or with chemotherapy can treat certain gastrointestinal (GI) cancers. The GI cancers being studied are either advanced (the cancer has spread to other parts of the body), or unresectable (the cancer cannot be removed with surgery). The goals of this study are to learn:

* About the safety and how well people tolerate sacituzumab tirumotecan alone or with chemotherapy
* How many people have the cancer respond (get smaller or go away) to treatment
Colorectal Cancer|Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma|Biliary Tract Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Sacituzumab tirumotecan|DRUG: Fluorouracil (5-FU)|DRUG: Leucovorin (LV) or levoleucovorin|DRUG: Rescue medication|DRUG: Supportive care measures
Number of Participants Who Experience a Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLT), A DLT is a medical problem related to the study medicine that prevents giving participants a higher dose or may prevent giving the participant the same dose. DLTs will be measured during Cycle 1 (the first 4 weeks) of treatment., Up to approximately 4 weeks|Number of Participants Who Experience One or More Adverse Events (AEs):, An AE is a health problem that happens or worsens during the study. The number of participants who have an AE during the study will be reported., Up to approximately 53 months|Number of Participants who Discontinue Study Treatment due to an AE, An AE is a health problem that happens or worsens during a study. The number of participants who stop study treatment will be reported., Up to approximately 53 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 as Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with Complete Response (CR: disappearance of all target lesions) or Partial Response (PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1. The percentage of participants who experience CR or PR as assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) will be presented., Up to approximately 53 months
Duration of Response (DOR) per RECIST 1.1 as Assessed by BICR, For participants who demonstrate a confirmed Complete Response or Partial Response, DOR is defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until progressive disease (PD) or death. Per RECIST 1.1, PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD. DOR as assessed by BICR will be presented., Up to approximately 53 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS) per RECIST 1.1 as Assessed by BICR, PFS is defined as the time from start of study treatment to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. According to RECIST 1.1, PD is defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD. PFS as assessed by BICR will be presented., Up to approximately 53 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS is the length of time from when the participant starts treatment until death from any cause, Up to approximately 53 months
