Study of Whole-brain Irradiation With Chloroquine for Brain Metastases
Background and purposes:Chloroquine (CLQ), an antimalarial drug, has a lysosomatrophic effect associate with increase the sensibility of Radiation through leakage of hidroliticenzimes, increase of apoptosis, autophagy mediated by lysosomalhidrolases and increase of oxidative stress "in vitro". In this phase II study we evaluated the efficacy and safety as radiosensitizing of the Chloroquine plus concomitant 30 Gray (Gy) of Whole-brain irradiation (WBI)in patients with brain metastases (BM) from solid tumors.
Brain Metastasis
DRUG: Chloroquine|RADIATION: Total brain radiotherapy
Overall Response Rate, Corresponding Complete plus Partial Response according with RECIST 1.1 Criteria, Every third month after randomization until 24 months follow-up. Measured by brain MRI
Central Nervous System Progression Free Survival, Clinical o radiological brain progression or death. Radiological Progression is measured by RECIST 1.1 Criteria, From time to progression to 24 months follow up
Quality of life in brain metastases, The 30-item EORTC Quality of Life (QoL) Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) version 3.0 (Mexican version) was used in this trial. The EORTC QLQ-C30 v3 consisted of five multi-item functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status/QoL scale, and six single items, The quality of life questionnaires were completed 1 day before radiotherapy began and 1 month later.
Seventy-three eligible patients were randomized. Thirty-nine patients received WBI (30 Gy in 10 fractions over 2 weeks) concomitant with 150 mg of CLQ for 4 weeks (the CLQ group). Thirty-four patients received the same schedule of WBI concomitant with a placebo for 4 weeks (the control arm). All the patients were evaluated for quality of life (QoL) using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire (Mexican version) before beginning radiotherapy and one month later.
