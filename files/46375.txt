Neoadjuvant PSMA-RLT in Oligometastatic PCa
Prospective single-center phase II study to evaluate the PSA, imaging and pathological response, as well as oncological outcomes of systemic radioligand therapy \[177Lu\]Lu-PSMAI\&T (PSMA-RLT) in patients planned for radical prostatectomy (RP) for oligometastatic prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosed using \[68Ga\]Ga-PSMA-11 PET examination.

Ten patients with oligometastatic primary PCa diagnosed using \[68Ga\]Ga-PSMA-11 PET-CT/MRI imaging will be included in this study.
