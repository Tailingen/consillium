Hypofractionated Preoperative Radiation for Head and Neck Cancers (HyPR-HN)
This is a phase 1 study to determine the safety of a condensed preoperative radiation regimen (10, 7, or 5 fractions) for the management of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.

RADIATION: 46 Gy Radiation Therapy|RADIATION: 40 Gy Radiation Therapy|RADIATION: 35 Gy Radiation Therapy
The number of subjects with a dose-limiting toxicity related to inoperability., Inoperability after HyPR-HN, is defined as an inability to proceed to surgery within eight weeks of radiation., 8 Weeks|The number of subjects with a dose-limiting toxicity related to perioperative complication rates., Severe perioperative complication rates, defined as unacceptable toxicity from initiation of treatment until 30 days postoperatively (grade 4/5 toxicity) probably or definitely related to treatment., 8 Weeks|The number of subjects with severe delayed toxicity., Severe delayed toxicities, defined as any unacceptable toxicity (grade 4+) after 30 days postoperatively until one year after initiation of HyPR-HN probably or definitely related to treatment., Up to one year
Overall survival, This measure is the number of subjects alive at one year following the conclusion of scheduled radiation therapy., One year|Recurrence-free Survival, This measure is the number of subjects who are survival free of locoregional recurrence or distant metastasis., One year
All subjects in this study will receive pre-operative hypofractionated radiation therapy, which will be subject to fractionation reduction, that being 10 fractions, 7 fractions, or 5 fractions, as compared to 30 fractions of conventional radiation therapy. All patients will subsequently undergo surgery for resection of remaining disease at the primary site and at-risk nodal basins 6-8 weeks after completion of radiation.

The subjects will receive smaller number of fractions (total visits) but with a higher dose of radiation with each Dose Level. Participants will receive a total radiation dose of 46 Gy in 10 fractions (Dose Level 1), 40 Gy in 7 fractions (Dose Level 2), or 35 Gy in 5 fractions (Dose Level 3), depending on the assigned experimental total fractions. Radiation will be delivered using intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) with a daily cone-beam CT for five days a week, for less than two weeks depending on the assigned dose level at the time of enrollment.

Due to the novelty of translational data and non-dependency on the primary endpoint, presentation and publication in a scientific journal of the translational endpoints may precede publication of the primary endpoint.
