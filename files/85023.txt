Study to Determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose for the Combination of Pomalidomide, Bortezomib and Low-Dose Dexamethasone in Subjects With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of pomalidomide in combination with bortezomib and low-dose dexamethasone in subjects with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Pomalidomide|DRUG: Bortezomib|DRUG: Dexamethasone
Maximum Tolerated Dose, To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), Up to 2 years
Adverse events, Number of participants with adverse events (AEs), Up to 7 years|Overall Survival, Number of patients alive, Up to 7 years|Response Rate, Overall response rate based on the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Uniform response criteria, Up to 7 years|Duration of response, Time from the initial documented response to confirmed disease progression, Up to 7 years|Time to response, Time from enrollment to the first documented response, Up to 7 years
A 3 + 3 design will be utilized to determine the MTD for POM + IV BTZ + LD-DEX combination treatment in a 21-day treatment cycle. DLT will be assessed to determine MTD during the first treatment cycle. Once the MTD is determined or the maximum planned dose (MPD) is reached without reaching MTD for POM + IV BTZ + LD-DEX, a cohort of 6 additional subjects will be treated at this MTD/MPD level to further confirm the safety and assess preliminary efficacy. An additional cohort of subjects will be enrolled to explore the safety for the combination of POM + BTZ + LD-DEX when using SQ BTZ. Subject in this cohort will receive POM + BTZ + LD-DEX at the MTD/MPD level per the MTD determination part of the study, except, the BTZ will be administered subcutaneously (SQ) instead of intravenously (IV). In, Protocol Amendment #4, the number of subject enrolled to be enrolled into the exploratory SQ BTZ cohort was increased from 6 to 12.
