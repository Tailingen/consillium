Zalutumumab in Combination With Chemo-Radiation in a Certain Type of Lung Cancer
The purpose of the study is to investigate if treatment with zalutumumab in combination with chemotherapy and radiotherapy (chemo-radiation) will lead to a prolonged life in patients with lung cancer compared to patients treated with chemo-radiation alone.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Zalutumumab|DRUG: Induction chemotherapy|RADIATION: Radiotherapy
Progression Free Survival Verified by Imaging Techniques., Disease progression was planned to be confirmed using RECIST criteria J Natl Cancer Inst 2000;92:205-16, Until disease progression
Adverse Events, Number of participants reporting at least one adverse event, Up to 3 months
Originally the study was planned as Part 1A, Part 1B and Part 2. Part 1A was one arm with zalatumumab fixed dose 8 mg/kg. Part 1B was planned as zalutumumab dose-titration and Part 2 adding a comparator. The trial was prematurely closed for enrolment when patients had only been enrolled in Part 1A due to published results showing increased toxicity from induction chemotherapy without any survival benefit.
