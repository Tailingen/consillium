HM2023-43:Ph 2 Trial of Tafasitamab With Lenalidomide+Rituximab in Treatment-naive FL and MZL
The study follows a Simon's two-stage phase II trial design to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tafasitamab added to rituximab and lenalidomide for two treatment-naïve, parallel, independent cohorts: follicular lymphoma (FL) and marginal zone lymphoma (MZ). Each cohort, FL and MZ, will be evaluated separately. This study is presented to the patient and consent is signed prior to the initiation of treatment for their primary malignancy.
