Recurrence Patterns and Cost-Effectiveness of Surgical Approaches in Early-Stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This study aims to investigate the recurrence patterns and cost-effectiveness of robotic-assisted, laparoscopic, and open liver resections in patients with early-stage (BCLC 0/A) hepatocellular carcinoma. By analyzing data from 3000 patients across 27 centers, the research evaluates recurrence-free survival, overall survival, and long-term economic impacts using metrics such as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Findings will provide insights into optimal surgical approaches to improve patient outcomes and healthcare resource utilization.
