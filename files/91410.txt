A Study of Daratumumab, Bortezomib, Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone (DVRd) Followed by Ciltacabtagene Autoleucel Versus Daratumumab, Bortezomib, Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone (DVRd) Followed by Autologous Stem Cell Transplant (ASCT) in Participants With Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of Daratumumab, Bortezomib, Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone (DVRd) followed by Ciltacabtagene Autoleucel versus Daratumumab, Bortezomib, Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone (DVRd) followed by Autologous Stem Cell Transplant (ASCT) in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients.

Progression free survival (PFS), Progression free survival is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documented PD, as defined in the IMWG criteria, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, up to 10 years ( or 300 PFS events)|Sustained MRD-negative CR, Sustained MRD-negative CR is defined as being MRD negative by bone marrow aspirate, as determined by NGS with a sensitivity of at least 10-5, and meeting the IMWG criteria for CR, and with MRD-negativity status confirmed at a minimum 12 months apart and without any examination showing MRD-positive status or PD in between., up to 24 months
Overall Response (OR), OR is defined as participants who achieve a partial response (PR) or better according to the IMWG criteria., up to 17 years|Complete Response (CR) or better status, CR or better is defined as percentage of participants who achieve a CR response or Stringent Complete Response (sCR) response according to the IMWG criteria., up to 17 years|Overall Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) -negative CR, achieving MRD-negative CR, as determined by NGS at any time after the date of randomization before initiation of subsequent antimyeloma therapy., up to 17 years|Time to subsequent antimyeloma therapy, Time to subsequent anti-myeloma therapy is defined as the time from randomization to the start of subsequent anti-myeloma therapy., up to 17 years|Progression Free Survival on Next-line Therapy (PFS2), the time from the date of randomization to the date of event, defined as PD as assessed by investigator that starts after the next line of subsequent therapy, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., up to 17 years|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival is measured from the date of randomization to the date of the participant's death., up to 17 years|Change from Baseline in Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) as Assessed by European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC-QLQ-C30) Scale Score, The EORTC QLQ-C30 includes 30 items in 5 functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social), 1 global health status scale, 3 symptom scales (pain, fatigue, nausea/vomiting), and 6 single symptom items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). The responses are reported using a verbal rating scale. The item and scale scores are transformed to a 0 to 100 scale. A higher score represents greater HRQoL, better functioning, and more (worse) symptoms., up to 17 years|Change from Baseline in Health-Related Quality of Life as Assessed by MySIm-Q Scale Score, The MySIm-Q is a disease-specific PRO assessment complementary to the EORTC-QLQ-C30. It includes 17 items with recall period of "7 days" and responses are reported on a 5-point verbal rating scale. Item responses are scored from 0 to 4. Higher scores indicate greater severity/impact., up to 17 years|Change from Baseline in Health-Related Quality of Life as Assessed by European Quality of Life - 5 Dimensions-5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L) Scale Scor, The EQ-5D-5L is a generic measure of health status. The EQ-5D-5L is a 5-item questionnaire that assesses 5 domains including mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each of the 5 dimensions is divided into 5 levels of perceived problems, where Level 1: no problem, Level 2: slight problems, Level 3: moderate problems, Level 4: severe problems and Level 5: extreme problems, plus a visual analog scale rating "health today" with anchors ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state)., up to 17 years|Change from Baseline in Health-Related Quality of Life as Assessed by Patient Global Impression of Symptom Severity (PGIS) Scale Score, The PGIS uses 2 items to assess the participant's perception of the severity of their disease symptoms and impact using a 5-point verbal rating scale. Score ranges from 1 (None) to 5 (Very Severe)., up to 17 years|Patient-reported Outcomes Version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE), The National Cancer Institute's PRO-CTCAE is an item library of common adverse events experienced by people with cancer that are appropriate for self-reporting. Each symptom selected for inclusion can be rated by up to 3 attributes characterizing the presence/frequency, severity, and/or interference that ranges from 0 to 4 with higher scores indicating higher frequency or greater severity/impact., up to 280 days
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant plasma cell disorder characterized by the production of monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) proteins or protein fragments (M proteins) that have lost their function.

JNJ-68284528 (ciltacabtagene autoleucel \[cilta-cel\]) is an autologous chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy that targets B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) that is being evaluated to treat participants with multiple myeloma. The primary hypothesis is that in transplant-eligible participants with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM), cilta-cel will significantly improve progression-free survival (PFS) and Sustained MRD-negative CR rate compared with Autologous Stem Cell Transplant (ASCT).

Approximately 750 participants (375 per arm) will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio into 2 arms.
