Development and Validation of a Blood Test for Early Diagnosis of Colorectal Cancer
This is a prospective, multicenter, case-control study. The aim is to develop an optimized algorithm by combining the levels of molecular markers in plasma together with risk factors for developing colorectal cancer and clinical data of patients diagnosed with CRC or AA and healthy individuals.
Colorectal Carcinoma|Advanced Adenomas (AA)
