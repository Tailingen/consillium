Overall tumor response rate (the proportion of subjects with the best tumor response of PR or CR within the first 6 cycles of treatment), Baseline, 8, 16, 24, 32 weeks (cycle 6)
Time to tumor progression, Baseline, every 8 weeks until progression|Survival, At 6 months|Tumor response rate at each tumor assessment time point (CR/PR/SD/PD/not assessable), At baseline and repeated every 2 cycles until tumor progression between Day 22 of even numbered cycles and Day 1 of subsequent odd numbered cycle and also at EOT and F-up visiit (90 days after the EOT and every 3 months until disease progression)|Time to death, Baseline, every 8 weeks until death|Number of participants with adverse events, Approximately 8-64 weeks
