Combined Therapy Using Oxaliplatin and Gemcitabine Chemotherapy, Lenvatinib and PD1 Antibody (JS001) for Patients With Advanced and Unresectable Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma
In this phase 2 study, the investigators aim to evaluate the effects and safety of combined therapy using oxaliplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy, Lenvatinib and immune checkpoint inhibitor PD-1 antibody (JS001) for patients with advanced and unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma

Most intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) patients are often accompanied by local or distant metastases and lose the opportunity for surgical resection. For patients with unresectable ICC who have been in stages IIIb and IV (AJCC/UICC, V2, 2018), the survival time is less than 4 months, and there is currently no standard treatment. The Gemox chemotherapy (oxaliplatin + gemcitabine) has been used in the treatment of advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, but the efficacy is still unsatisfactory. Lenvatinib is a small molecule multi-kinase inhibitor, the main targets including VEGFR1-3, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1-4, PDGFRÎ±, RET(ret proto-oncogene ), KIT(KIT proto-oncogene, receptor tyrosine kinase), have anti-angiogenic effects, have been proven effective in hepatocellular carcinoma. In recent years, monoclonal antibodies against programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) have shown remarkable therapeutic effects in the treatment of various solid tumors. Combined with other means such as chemotherapy and targeted drugs is an important direction to improve the therapeutic effect of immunological checkpoint inhibitors. In this study, the investigators aim to evaluate the effects and safety of Gemox chemotherapy combined with Lenvatinib and immune checkpoint inhibitor PD-1 antibody (JS001) for patients with advanced and unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.
