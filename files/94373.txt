EUS-RFA for Unresectable Pancreatic Cancer
The clinical application of intraoperative or percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is limited due to higher mortality and incidence of adverse events. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of endoscopic ultrasonography-guided RFA (EUS-RFA) for locally advanced, unresectable PDAC. Patients with unresectable PDAC who underwent EUS-RFA were included from September 2013 to June 2016. Pre- and post-procedural clinical data was retrospective collected.
