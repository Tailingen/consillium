Study of the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of XL147 (SAR245408) in Adults With Solid Tumors or Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of XL147 in subjects with solid tumors or lymphoma. Both a capsule and a tablet formulation will be evaluated. XL147 is a new chemical entity that inhibits PI3 Kinase. Inactivation of PI3K has been shown to inhibit growth and induce apoptosis (programmed cell death) in tumor cells.
