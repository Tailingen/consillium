Morehouse Total Cancer Care Protocol
The overall objective of the Morehouse Total Cancer Care study is to develop an improved standard of cancer care by facilitating new biomarker and drug target discovery, informatics solutions, clinical trials, and "personalized medicine" for our community oncology partners (i.e., community hospital systems, and other cancer care providers). To bring new translational research to the community, Morehouse School of Medicine has initiated the Total Cancer Care Program (TCCP). The TCCP establishes a unique collection of blood, tissue, other biological samples and their associated data (survey data, medical records data, cancer registry data, and other related data) from thousands of African American cancer patients, survivors, or those at risk of having cancer. This is not a treatment trial, but a longitudinal study designed to create a centralized cancer biorepository for precision medicine.

Improve Standard of Cancer Care, Establish a longitudinal clinical and related data and tissue repository that will contain cancer predisposing risk factors via surveys and questionnaires., Time Frame: up to 20 years|Improve Standard of Cancer Care, Establish a longitudinal clinical and related data repository that will contain quality of life care via surveys and questionnaires, Time Frame: up to 20 years|Improve Standard of Cancer Care, Establish a longitudinal tissue repository that will contain blood, tissue, and other biological samples other biological samples and associated clinical data collected from consenting patients., Time Frame: up to 20 years
Through this protocol, Morehouse School of Medicine and its partners will establish and maintain a unique repository of blood, tissue, other biological samples and their associated data (survey data, medical records data, cancer registry data, and other related data) collected from thousands of patients 18 years of age or older who have cancer or are at risk of developing cancer. In this protocol, investigators require an informed consent of patients to study their answers to survey questions that may be collected as part of their regular clinical care, permission to study their medical and related records, and permission to collect excess tissues removed at the time of planned surgery, an additional tumor sampling (needle passes) at the time of planned diagnostic biopsies, previously collected, stored tumor tissue (if available), blood, and/or other biological samples. Additional research tumor samples may be collected at the time of any diagnostic needle biopsy or endoscopic biopsy or, if available, patient tissue from a previous procedure will be obtained and utilized as needed. Clinical and related data will be collected on all patients from the time of initial entry into the study and will continue for life.
