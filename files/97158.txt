A Phase 2 Study of Zanidatamab in Patients With HER2-expressing Tumors
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of zanidatamab for the treatment of participants with previously treated solid tumors that have Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) Immunohistochemistry (IHC) 3+ overexpression.
