Disease control, defined as achievement of either CR, PR, or SD, as defined by modified Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (mRANO) criteria., Complete response (CR) is seen as the disappearance of all enhancing measurable and non-measurable disease sustained for at least 4 weeks.

Partial response (PR) is ≥50% decrease in sum of products of perpendicular diameters or ≥65% decrease in total volume of all measurable enhancing lesions compared with baseline, sustained for at least 4 weeks.

Stable disease (SD), must be present on two consecutive MRI scans, with the 2nd/confirmatory MRI performed at least 16 weeks after starting treatment., When termination of the study or 5 years after removal from protocol therapy, whichever occurs first.
Number of AEs (Adverse Events), Assessed by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0, all events will be recorded from the time a subject has signed the informed consent form., When termination of the study or 5 years after removal from protocol therapy, whichever occurs first.|Duration of disease control., Achieving a confirmed best response to treatment of stable disease (SD), partial response (PR), or complete response (CR)., When termination of the study or 5 years after removal from protocol therapy, whichever occurs first.|Objective radiographic response (ORR), ORR is defined by mRANO criteria, and duration of response., When termination of the study or 5 years after removal from protocol therapy, whichever occurs first.|Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from date of enrollment until the earliest date of disease progression (as determined by mRANO criteria) or death due to any cause., When termination of the study or 5 years after removal from protocol therapy, whichever occurs first.|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from date of enrollment until death from any cause., When termination of the study or 5 years after removal from protocol therapy, whichever occurs first.
Objective response rate (ORR) associations., Association between pre-treatment tumor genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and prior bevacizumab use and ORR., When termination of the study or 5 years after removal from protocol therapy, whichever occurs first.|Progression-free survival (PFS) associations, Association between pre-treatment tumor genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and prior bevacizumab use and PFS., When termination of the study or 5 years after removal from protocol therapy, whichever occurs first.|Overall survival (OS) associations, Association between pre-treatment tumor genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and prior bevacizumab use and OS., When termination of the study or 5 years after removal from protocol therapy, whichever occurs first.
Tumor-treating fields (TTFields) causes downregulation of BRCA1 signaling and reduced deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) double-strand break repair capacity. Tumors that are deficient in the homologous recombination DNA damage repair pathway are highly sensitive to blockade of the repair of single strand DNA breaks via poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibition. This is a study of niraparib, a PARP inhibitor, in combination with tumor-treating fields for recurrent glioblastoma. We hypothesize that tumor-treating fields will induce a state of "BRCAness" in the glioma tumor cells, thus sensitizing them to PARP inhibition and resulting in tumor cell death.
