Incidence
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in pregnant and postpartum women and occurs in about 1 in 3,000 pregnant women.  The average patient is between the ages of 32 years and 38 years. Because many women are choosing to delay childbearing, it is
likely that the incidence of breast cancer during pregnancy will increase.
Anatomy
Enlarge
The female breast contains lobes, lobules, and ducts that produce and transport milk to the nipple. Fatty tissue gives the breast its shape, while muscles and the chest wall provide support. The lymphatic system, including lymph nodes, filter lymph and store white blood cells that help fight infection and disease.
Diagnostic Evaluation
The natural tenderness and engorgement of the breasts of pregnant and lactating
women may hinder detection of discrete masses and early diagnosis
of breast cancer.  Delays in diagnosis are common, with an average reported
delay of 5 to 15 months from the onset of symptoms.[
1
-
4
]  Because of this
delay, cancers are typically detected at a later stage than in a nonpregnant,
age-matched population.[
5
]
The following tests and procedures may be used to diagnose breast cancer during pregnancy:
Breast self-examination.
Clinical breast examination.
Ultrasound.
Biopsy and hormone receptor assays.
Mammography.
To detect breast cancer, pregnant and lactating
women should consider practicing self-examination and undergo a clinical breast examination as part
of the routine prenatal examination by a doctor.  If an abnormality is found,
diagnostic approaches such as ultrasound and mammography may be used.  With
proper shielding, mammography poses little risk of radiation exposure to the
fetus.[
6
]  However, mammograms are only used  to evaluate dominant masses
and to locate occult carcinomas in the presence of other suspicious physical
findings.[
6
]
Because at least 25% of mammograms in pregnancy may be negative in
the presence of cancer, a biopsy is essential for the diagnosis of any palpable
mass.  Diagnosis may be safely accomplished with a fine-needle aspiration, core biopsy, or
excisional biopsy under local anesthesia.  To avoid a false-positive diagnosis
as a result of misinterpretation of pregnancy-related changes, the pathologist
should be advised that the patient is pregnant.[
7
]
Breast cancer pathology is similar in age-matched pregnant and nonpregnant
women.  Hormone receptor assays using a competitive binding assay are usually negative in pregnant patients with breast cancer, but this may be the result of receptor binding by high serum estrogen
levels associated with the pregnancy.  Enzyme immunocytochemical
receptor assays  are more sensitive than competitive binding assays.  A study
that used both assay methods indicated similar receptor positivity between pregnant
and nonpregnant women with breast cancer.[
8
]  The study concluded that
increased estrogen levels during pregnancy could result in a higher incidence
of receptor positivity detected with immunohistochemistry than is detected by
radiolabeled ligand-binding assay because of competitive inhibition by high levels of
endogenous estrogen.
For more information, see the
Diagnosis
section in Breast Cancer Treatment.
Prognosis
The overall survival of pregnant women with breast cancer may be worse than that of nonpregnant women at all stages.[
6
]  However, this discrepancy may be primarily the result of  delayed diagnosis.[
9
]
Termination of pregnancy has not shown any beneficial effect on
breast cancer outcome and is not usually considered as a therapeutic
option.[

Staging Evaluation
American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Stage Groupings and Definitions of TNM
Staging Evaluation
The following procedures are used to determine the extent of the cancer:
Chest x-ray.
Bone scan.
Ultrasound of the liver.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain.
Procedures used for determining the stage of breast cancer are modified for pregnant women to avoid
radiation exposure to the fetus.  Nuclear scans cause fetal
radiation exposure.[
1
]  If such scans are essential for evaluation, hydration and
Foley catheter drainage of the bladder can be used to prevent retention of
radioactivity.  Timing of the exposure to radiation relative to the gestational
age of the fetus may be more critical than the actual dose of radiation
delivered.[
2
]  Radiation exposure during the first trimester (>0.1 Gy) may lead to
congenital malformations, intellectual disability, and increased relative risk of carcinogenesis.
Chest x-rays with abdominal shielding are considered
safe, but as with all radiological procedures, they are used only when
essential for making treatment decisions.[
1
,
3
]  A chest x-ray delivers 0.00008 Gy.[
4
]
For the diagnosis of bone
metastases, a bone scan is preferable to a skeletal series because the bone
scan delivers a smaller amount of radiation and is more sensitive.  A bone scan
delivers 0.001 Gy.[
5
]
Evaluation
of the liver can be performed with ultrasound, and brain metastases can be
diagnosed with an MRI scan.   Data on MRI during pregnancy are not available, but gadolinium crosses the placenta and is associated with fetal abnormalities in rats.[

Treatment of Early/Localized/Operable Breast Cancer During Pregnancy
In This Section
Surgery
Chemotherapy
Fluorouracil dosing
Endocrine Therapy
Targeted Therapy
Generally, pregnant women with stage I or stage II breast cancer are treated in the same way as nonpregnant patients, with 
some modifications to protect the fetus.
Treatment options for early/localized/operable breast cancer in pregnant women include:
Surgery
. Postpartum radiation therapy may also be given to women diagnosed with breast cancer late in pregnancy.
Chemotherapy
(after the first trimester).
Endocrine therapy
(after delivery).
The use of
trastuzumab
during pregnancy is contraindicated.
Surgery
Surgery is recommended as the primary treatment of breast cancer in pregnant
women.
The data 
regarding safety of sentinel lymph node biopsy in pregnant patients are limited to several retrospective case 
series.  One study examined sentinel lymph node biopsy in eight  patients in the first trimester, nine patients in the second trimester,
and eight  patients in the third 
trimester.  Technetium Tc 99m alone was used in 16 patients, methylene blue dye alone 
was used in seven patients, and two patients had unknown mapping methods.  All 25 patients had live-born infants, 
of whom 24 were healthy, and one had a cleft palate (in the setting of other maternal risk factors).[
1
]
Because radiation in therapeutic doses may expose the fetus to
potentially harmful scatter radiation,[
2
]  modified radical mastectomy is the
treatment of choice if the breast cancer was diagnosed early in 
pregnancy.  If diagnosed late in pregnancy, breast-conserving surgery with postpartum radiation therapy
has been used for breast preservation.[
3
]  An analysis has been performed that
helps to  predict the risk of waiting to have radiation.[
4
,
5
]
Chemotherapy
Data suggest that it is safe to administer certain chemotherapeutic drugs after the first trimester, with most pregnancies resulting in live births with low
 rates of morbidity in the newborns.
Anthracycline-based 
chemotherapy (doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide or fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and 
cyclophosphamide [FAC]) appears to be safe to administer during the second and/or third trimester 
on the basis of  limited prospective data.[
6
-
8
] Safety data on the use of taxanes during pregnancy are limited.
Evidence (use of chemotherapy during the second and/or third trimester of pregnancy):
A multicenter 
case-control study compared pediatric outcomes of 129 children whose mothers had breast cancer 
with  matched children of women without cancer. 
 In the pregnancy study group, 96 children 
(74.4%) were exposed to chemotherapy, 11 (8.5%) to radiation therapy, 13 (10.1%) to surgery alone, 2 
(1.7%) to other drug treatments, and 14 (10.9%) to no treatment.[
9
]
The study 
showed that there was no 
significant difference in birth weight below the 10th
 percentile (22% in the breast cancer treatment‒exposed 
group vs. 15.2% in the control group,
P
= .16) or in cognitive development based on the Bayley 
score (
P
= .08). The gestational age at birth was correlated with cognitive outcome in the two study 
groups.
Evaluation of cardiac function among 47 children, who were age 36 months in the study group, showed 
normal cardiac findings.
In a prospective
 single-arm study, 57 pregnant patients 
with breast cancer were treated with FAC in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant
 setting.[
6
]
Survey data 
collected when the children were aged 2 months to 157 months revealed that no stillbirths, miscarriages, or 
perinatal deaths occurred.
One child born vaginally at a gestational age of 38 weeks had a 
subarachnoid hemorrhage on day 2 postpartum, one child 
had Down syndrome, and two children had congenital 
anomalies (club foot and bilateral ureteral reflux).
The findings of the prospective single-arm study above were consistent with other smaller 
retrospective series of anthracycline-based chemotherapy.[
7
,
8
]
A systematic review studied 40 case 
reports of taxane administration during the second or 
third trimesters of pregnancy.[
10
]
Minimal maternal, fetal, or neonatal toxicity 
was observed.
Fluorouracil dosing
The
DPYD
gene encodes an enzyme that catabolizes pyrimidines and fluoropyrimidines, like capecitabine and fluorouracil. An estimated 1% to 2% of the population has germline pathogenic variants in
DPYD
, which lead to reduced DPD protein function and an accumulation of pyrimidines and fluoropyrimidines in the body.[
11
,
12
] Patients with the
DPYD*2A
variant who receive fluoropyrimidines may experience severe, life-threatening toxicities that are sometimes fatal. Many other
DPYD
variants have been identified,  with a range of clinical effects.[
11
-
13
] Fluoropyrimidine avoidance or a dose reduction of 50% may be recommended based on  the patient's
DPYD
genotype and number of functioning
DPYD
alleles.[
14
-
16
]
DPYD
genetic testing costs less than $200, but insurance coverage varies due to  a lack of national guidelines.[
17
] In addition, testing may delay therapy by 2 weeks, which would not be advisable in urgent situations. This controversial issue requires further evaluation.[
18
]
Endocrine Therapy
Endocrine therapy is generally avoided
 until after delivery.  Case reports and a literature review of 
tamoxifen during pregnancy show that tamoxifen administration during pregnancy is associated with vaginal bleeding, miscarriage, congenital 
abnormalities such as  Goldenhar syndrome, and fetal death.[
19
-
21
]  Breastfeeding is also not recommended 
concurrently with endocrine therapy.[
22
]
Targeted Therapy
The use of trastuzumab during pregnancy is contraindicated
 based on results of a systematic review of 
17 studies (18 pregnancies, 19 newborns).[
23
] Of the fetal 
complications noted, occurrence of oligohydramnios/anhydramnios was the most common (61.1%) 
adverse event. Of the pregnancies exposed to trastuzumab during the second or third trimester, 73.3% of the pregnancies  were 
complicated with oligohydramnios/anhydramnios. Of the pregnancies exposed to 
trastuzumab exclusively during the first trimester, 0%
 (
P
= .043) of the pregnancies were complicated with oligohydramnios/anhydramnios. The mean gestational age at 
delivery was 33.8 weeks, and the mean weight of newborns at delivery was 2,261 grams or 4.984 pounds. In 52.6% of 
cases, a healthy neonate was born. At the long-term evaluation, all children who were without complications at birth 
were healthy, with a median follow-up of 9 months, and four of nine children with complications at birth 
had died within an interval ranging from birth to  5.25 months. All children exposed to trastuzumab in 
utero exclusively in the first trimester were completely 
healthy at birth. The data suggest that for women 
who become pregnant during trastuzumab administration and wish to 
continue pregnancy, trastuzumab should be stopped and pregnancy would be allowed to continue.

Treatment of Advanced Breast Cancer During Pregnancy
There is no standard treatment for patients with advanced (stage III or stage IV) breast cancer during pregnancy. Most studies show a 5-year survival rate of 10% in pregnant
patients with stage III or IV disease.
First-trimester radiation therapy should be avoided.  Chemotherapy may be given
after the first trimester as discussed in the section on
Treatment of Early/Localized/Operable Breast Cancer During Pregnancy
.
Because the mother's life span may be
limited, and there is a risk of fetal damage
with treatment during the first trimester,[
1
,
2
] issues regarding continuation of
the pregnancy should be discussed with the patient and her family.  Therapeutic
abortion does not improve prognosis.[

Fetal Consequences of Maternal Breast Cancer
Pregnancy in Patients With a History of Breast Cancer
Lactation
Suppression of lactation does not improve prognosis. If surgery  is
planned, however, lactation is suppressed to decrease the size and vascularity of
the breasts.  If chemotherapy is to be given, lactation is also suppressed because many antineoplastic agents (i.e., cyclophosphamide and methotrexate), when 
given systemically,  may occur in high levels in breast milk and would
affect the nursing baby.  Women receiving chemotherapy should not
breastfeed.[
1
]
Fetal Consequences of Maternal Breast Cancer
No damaging effects on the fetus from maternal breast cancer have been
demonstrated,[
2
] and there are no reported cases of maternal-fetal transfer of
breast cancer cells.
Pregnancy in Patients With a History of Breast Cancer
Based on limited retrospective data, pregnancy does not appear to compromise the survival of women with a previous
history of breast cancer, and no
deleterious effects have been demonstrated in the fetus.[
3
-
11
]  Some
physicians recommend that patients wait 2 years after diagnosis before
attempting to conceive.  This allows early recurrence to become manifest, which
may influence the decision to become a parent.
Little is known about pregnancy
after bone marrow transplant and high-dose chemotherapy with or without
total-body irradiation.  In one report of pregnancies after bone marrow
transplant for hematologic disorders, a 25% incidence of preterm labor and low
birth weight for gestational-age infants was noted.[
