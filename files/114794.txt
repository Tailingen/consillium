First Line Study of Tamibarotene in Combination for Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
The goal of this study is to determine the progression-free survival and objective response rate in subjects with either stage IIIB with pleural effusion NSCLC or stage IV NSCLC who are treated with up to six cycles of paclitaxel plus carboplatin and either tamibarotene or placebo. Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive tamibarotene, 6 mg/m2, divided as twice daily orally, or an equal number of matching placebo tablets, starting 1 week before chemotherapy and continuing through all 6 cycles and beyond. Subjects will be assessed for response on Day 50, Day 113, then every other month using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1).
Stage IIIB Non-small Cell Lung Cancer With Pleural Effusion|Stage IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Tamibarotene|DRUG: Placebo
Progression-free survival, Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from enrollment (i.e., assignment of subject ID number) to first documentation of objective tumor progression or to death due to any cause in the absence of previous documentation of objective tumor progression., Within 18 months of study start.
Objective response rate, Objective tumor response will be evaluated using the RECIST 1.1 criteria., Within 18 months of study start.|Overall survival, Within 24 months of study start.|Assessment of quality of life, EORTC QLQ-C30 version 3., Within 24 months of study start.
