The Safety and Efficacy of Autologous Transfusion in Spinal Surgery for Lung Cancer With Spinal Metastasis
The goal of this single-center prospective randomized controlled trial is to test and compare the safety and effectiveness of autologous blood transfusion in spinal surgery for lung cancer spinal metastases. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Does autologous blood transfusion increase the incidence of new metastases?
* Does autologous blood transfusion affect postoperative hemoglobin levels and the number of circulating tumor cells in the blood?
* Can autologous blood transfusion reduce the rate of allogeneic transfusion during and after surgery for spinal metastases?

PROCEDURE: Autoblood transfusion
Intraoperative and postoperative allogeneic blood transfusion rate, The number of allogeneic blood transfusion patients (Intraoperative or postoperative )/ the total number of patients, Through study completion, an average of 1 year
Number of circulating tumor cells in the blood, Number of circulating tumor cells in the blood, within 30 days post-surgery|Incidence of transfusion related adverse reactions, the number of adverse reactions/ the total number of patients, within 14 days post-surgery|occurence of new lesions, the number of patients with occurence of new lesions / the total number of patients, through study completion, an average of 1 year
In this study, participants underwent standard open spinal decompression surgery, and when blood transfusion was needed, autologous blood transfusion or allogeneic blood transfusion was used. Participants will be patients with lung cancer spinal metastases. Investigators will use flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and tumor cell culture methods to measure the number of circulating tumor cells in the blood before and after autologous blood transfusion.

Investigators will compare participants who receive autologous blood transfusion with those who do not to observe if there are differences in:

* The incidence of new metastases
* The rate of allogeneic transfusion during and after surgery
* Postoperative hemoglobin levels
* The number of circulating tumor cells in the blood
* The cost associated with transfusion
