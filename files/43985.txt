This is a Phase I, multi-center, open-label, dose-finding study of ATG-022 in patients with advanced solid tumours. The study design includes a Dose Escalation Phase which will enroll subjects with advanced/metastatic solid tumors, and a Dose Expansion Phase which will enroll select advanced/metastatic solid tumors with Claudin 18.2-positive expression at the defined maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) to further evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of ATG-022.
