Pelvic Microbiomes of Benign and Malignant Ovarian Diseases
This case-control study aims to compare the pelvic microbiomes of benign ovarian diseases and ovarian malignancies by 16s RNA techniques and culture. Discharges/flushing fluid from vagina, faces and fimbria end of fallopian tube are collected from age and menopausal status matched patient before and during procedures of laparoscopies. The discharges/flushing fluid would be sent for 16s RNA analysis and microculture respectively, and the results would get self-contrasted comparison and case-control comparison.
