Chidamide/Everolimus for PIK3CA Wild-type/Mutant HR+/HER2- Advanced Breast Cancer
To explore the efficacy and safety of chidamide combined with endocrine in phosphoinositide-3-kinase,catalytic,alpha gene(PI3KCA) wild type hormone receptor positive(HR+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer patients and to explore the efficacy and safety of Everolimus combined with endocrine therapy in patients with PI3KCA Mutant HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer.

First stage progression free survival (PFS1), First stage progression free survival (PFS1), 2 years
Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS), 2 years|objective response rate (ORR), objective response rate (ORR), 2 years|disease control rate (DCR), disease control rate (DCR), 2 years|clinical benefit rate (CBR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), 2 years|time to chemotherapy, time to chemotherapy, Through study completion，an average of 1 year|chemotherapy free survival, chemotherapy free survival, Through study completion，an average of 1 year|patient reported outcome indicators (PRO), National Cancer Center of China-Breast Cancer-A 1.0 (NCC-BC-A 1.0) during the study was used to assess the quality of life；The minimum to maximum values: 0 , 100 Meaning: the higher scores mean a better outcome., Through study completion，an average of 1 year
This study is an open, multi center, prospective cohort, and Phase II exploratory research. According to the PIK3CA gene mutation status of patients, the study is divided into two cohorts. The PIK3CA Mutant uses everolimus combined with endocrine therapy as the cohort A, and the PIK3CA wild type uses chidamide combined with endocrine therapy as the cohort B, until the disease progresses or the toxicity is intolerable. According to the judgment of the researchers, whether to enter the second stage of cross design, Queue A was cross administered with chidamide in combination with endocrine therapy. Cohort B cross used everolimus combined with endocrine until the disease progressed or the toxicity was intolerable.
