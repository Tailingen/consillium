MR Textural Analysis in Low Grade Gliomas
WHO classification of low grade gliomas now relies on tumoral molecular patterns, especially on IDH mutation and 1p/19q co deletion status. Textural analysis on medical imaging is studied in several fields, and could provide help in patients with brain tumor due to possible complications of brain biopsy. The purpose of this study is to determine if specific textural signature on MR imaging could be found for low grade gliomas. The investigators included patients with LGG diagnosed at CHU of Nice abd whose first MRI was available on the PACS of the CHU. Textural data are extraxted by tumoral contouring and specific logiciel (LifeX) and histopathologic data are assessed for each patient. Then the investigators analyze it to dtermine if textural indices can predict molecar status.
