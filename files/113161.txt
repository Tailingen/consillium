Multi-omics Model Predicts Efficacy of Preoperative Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy Combined PD-1 Antibody Therapy for Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer
The purpose of this clinical research is to establish a multi-omics model based on genomics，transcriptomics，gut microbiota in predicting pathologic response after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy combined PD-1 antibody given to patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.
Colorectal Neoplasms
COMBINATION_PRODUCT: long course radiotherapy + capecitabine + PD-1 monoclonal antibody
pathologic complete response（pCR）, All the enrolled patients will receive total mesorectal excision (TME) 7-9 weeks after the end of long course radiotherapy. The rectal specimens will be evaluated by the pathologists who are experienced on the rectal cancer diagnosis according to the 1997 Dworak grading system. The rectal cancer will be classified into 5 grades. Grade 0-3 will be considered as non-pCR while grade 4 represent pCR., 1 year
