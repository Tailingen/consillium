The Effect of Clip-traction on ESD Resection Time.
Patients scheduled for an endoscopic submucosal dissection(ESD) in the colorectum will be randomized to the use of a traction device(consisting of an endoscopic clip with a loop of dental floss secured in the lesion to be removed, another clip will anchor the loop to adjacent bowel wall) or a standard ESD.
Adenoma Colon
DEVICE: clip-traction
Resection speed (mm2/min), Measured as area of the removed lesion divided by procedure time., Within completion of procedure
Patients with an adenoma or an early colorectal cancer treatable with endoscopic submucosal dissection will be randomized to the use of a traction device or a standard ESD. Location, morphology and size of the lesion will be recorded. Time of the procedure will be measured using a stopwatch
