Safety Study of PLX3397 and Paclitaxel in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This was a 3-part study designed to explore the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of PLX3397 with weekly paclitaxel to establish a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), to confirm RP2D in participants with advanced non-resectable solid tumors, and to determine the efficacy of PLX3397 600 mg twice daily (BID) administered in combination with weekly paclitaxel in participants with advanced, metastatic or non-resectable, platinum-resistant or -refractory epithelial ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer, or fallopian tube cancer.
Solid Tumors
DRUG: PLX3397|DRUG: Paclitaxel
Percentage of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (>10%) Classified by Preferred Term Following PLX3397 Administered in Combination With Paclitaxel (Parts 1 and 2) (Safety Population), Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported by \>10% of all participants in Parts 1 and 2 are reported., From post first dose up to 28 days after the last dose, up to 5 years 9 months|Percentage of Participants With TEAEs (>10%) Classified by Preferred Term Following PLX3397 Administered in Combination With Paclitaxel (Part 3) (Safety Population), Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported by \>10% of all participants in Part 3 are reported., From post first dose up to 28 days after the last dose, up to 5 years 9 months|Best Overall Tumor Response Based on RECIST V1.1 Following PLX3397 Administered in Combination With Paclitaxel (Parts 1 and 2) (Efficacy Evaluable Population), Best overall tumor response (complete response \[CR\], partial response \[PR\], stable disease \[SD\], progressive disease \[PD\]) is reported, including participants who were not evaluable (NE). RECIST v1.1 for target lesions are assessed by magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, or positron emission tomography-computed tomography and are summarized as: CR, Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm; PR, At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters; PD, at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (includes the baseline sum). In addition, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm; SD, Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study., From post first dose up to 5 years 9 months post dose|Best Overall Tumor Response Based on RECIST V1.1 Following PLX3397 Administered in Combination With Paclitaxel (Part 3) (Efficacy Evaluable Population), Best overall tumor response (complete response \[CR\], partial response \[PR\], stable disease \[SD\], progressive disease \[PD\]) is reported, including participants who were not evaluable (NE).

Duration of Response Following PLX3397 Administered in Combination With Paclitaxel (Parts 1 and 2) (Efficacy Evaluable Population), From the date of initial response until disease progression or death, whichever occurs first, up to 5 years 9 months post dose|Duration of Response Following PLX3397 Administered in Combination With Paclitaxel (Part 3) (Efficacy Evaluable Population), From the date of initial response until disease progression or death, whichever occurs first, up to 5 years 9 months post dose|Progression-free Survival Following PLX3397 Administered in Combination With Paclitaxel (Part 3) (Efficacy Evaluable Population), Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the number of days from the start of therapy (i.e. Cycle 1 Day 1) to the date of first documented disease progression/relapse or death, whichever occurs first. If the disease progression/relapse does not occur, PFS will be censored as of the date of their last evaluable tumor assessments., From the first day of treatment to the first documented disease progression or date of death, whichever occurred first, up to 5 years 9 months post dose|A Summary of Pharmacokinetic Parameter (Tmax) Following Exposure to PLX3397 (Parts 1 and 3), Cycle 1, Day 15|A Summary of Pharmacokinetic Parameter (Cmax) Following Exposure to PLX3397 (Parts 1 and 3), Cycle 1, Day 15|A Summary of Pharmacokinetic Parameters (AUC[0-4h], AUC[0-6h], and AUC[0-12h]) Following Exposure to PLX3397 (Parts 1 and 3), Cycle 1, Day 15|Percentage of Participants With PLX3397-Related Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (>10%) by Preferred Term (Parts 1 and 2) (Safety Analysis Set), From post first dose up to 28 days after the last dose, up to 5 years 9 months|Percentage of Participants With Paclitaxel-Related Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (>10%) by Preferred Term (Parts 1 and 2) (Safety Analysis Set), From post first dose up to 28 days after the last dose, up to 5 years 9 months|Percentage of Participants With PLX3397- and/or Paclitaxel-Related TEAEs (>10%) by Preferred Term (Part 3) (Safety Analysis Set), From post first dose up to 28 days after the last dose, up to 5 years 9 months
