Study of LVGN7409 (CD40 Agonist Antibody) in Locally Advanced, Metastatic or Recurrent/Refractory Malignancy
The study of LVGN7409-201 is designed to use a bridging dose escalation to quickly establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended dose for expansion (RDE) as well as the recommended Phase 2 dose(s) (RP2D) of LVGN7409 as a single agent (monotherapy) in the treatment of locally advanced, metastatic or recurrent/refractory malignancy.
Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: LVGN7409
MTD and/or RDE and RP2D, MTD or RDE or RP2D will be determined according to safety, tolerability, Pharmacokinetic (PK) profile and clinical activity., up to 24 months|Incidence rate of Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLT) within 3 weeks after first dose, Incidence rate of dose-limiting toxicities within 3 weeks after first dose, up to 24 months|Safety and tolerability (Serious adverse events, adverse events, dose-limiting toxicities, Maximum Tolerated Dose), Adverse events will be assessed, and severity will be assigned by using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (ECI CTCAE) v5.0., up to 24 months
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR will be documented as the percentage of paritcipants who achived either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), as assessed based on RECIST v1.1 and iRECIST critieria., up to 24 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR will be documented as the percentage of participants who achived CR, PR or stable disease (SD), as assessed based on RECIST v1.1 and iRECIST critieria., up to 24 months|Duration of Respons (DOR), DOR will be documented as the time from the date on which objective response (CR or PR)., up to 24 months|PK parameter, PK parameter：AUC0-∞, up to 24 months|PK parameter, PK parameter：AUC0-t, up to 24 months|PK parameter, PK parameter：Cmax, up to 24 months|PK parameter, PK parameter：Tmax, up to 24 months|PK parameter, PK parameter：T1/2, up to 24 months|PK parameter, PK parameter：CL, up to 24 months|Anti drug antibody (ADA) to LVGN7409, The presence of ADA directed against LVGN7409 will be determined., up to 24 months
Biomarkers PD-L1/ MSI/dMMR and/or tumor mutational burden (TMB), Level of PD-L1/ MSI/dMMR and/or TMB will be assessed., up to 24 months|Biomarkers IL-6, IL-12, TNF-α, IFN-γ and soluble CD40 antigen, Level of IL-6, IL-12, TNF-α, IFN-γ and soluble CD40 antigen in serum will be assessed., up to 24 months|Immune cell typing in peripheral blood, CD40 receptor occupation in B lymphocyte cell., The change of biomarkers will be assessed., up to 24 months
