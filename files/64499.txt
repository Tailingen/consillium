Compare Efficacy and Safety of Raltitrexed-based and 5fu-based Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Colorectal Liver Metastasis
This study is a multicenter ,randomization, open control study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Raltitrexed-based chemotherapy and 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy in the peri-operative treatment of patients with Liver Metastasis From colorectal cancer (CRC).
Colorectal Cancer|Liver Metastasis
DRUG: Raltitrexed-based chemotherapy|DRUG: Raltitrexed-based chemotherapy|DRUG: 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy|DRUG: 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy
Objective response rate, 38 months
R0 resection rate of liver, 38 months
The side effects of the treatment, 38 months|The early tumor shrinkage （ETS）and depth of response(DPR), 38 months
The contrast analysis is separately done on Raltitrexed plus oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil plus oxaliplatin;Raltitrexed plus irinotecan and 5-fluorouracil plus irinotecan.To investigate the objective response rate,the R0 resection rate, the early tumor shrinkage （ETS）and depth of response(DPR) and the safety profile.
