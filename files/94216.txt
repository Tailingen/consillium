CASCADE-LUNG: Cancer Screening Assay Using DELFI; A Clinical Validation Study in Lung
CASCADE-LUNG is an event-driven, multisite, prospective, observational, blood specimen collection study in the elevated-risk lung cancer screening population. The primary objective is to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the Delfi Lung Cancer ScreeningTest (DLCST).
Lung Cancer
OTHER: Blood Sample Collection
Performance characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV) of the DLCST., Approximately 4 months
Performance characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV) of the Delfi DLCST based on results at the time of a 12-month follow-up., Approximately 12 months|Adverse events (AEs) associated with the blood specimen collection., Approximately 12 months
Participants will be enrolled into the DELFI-L201 study after informed consent and eligibility is confirmed. DELFI identifies circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to detect cancer. The study purpose is to validate the performance of the DELFI-based test for the detection of lung cancer among individuals eligible for routine lung cancer screening. Participants will have blood collected and medical record review at baseline and will have medical records reviews at two additional timepoints.
