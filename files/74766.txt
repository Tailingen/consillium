First in Human Dose Escalation Study of YL-13027 in Subjects With Advanced Stage Solid Tumors
YL-13027-001 is a phase I open-label, first in human, dose escalation study which investigate the tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and efficacy of YL-13027 in subjects with advanced stage solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: YL-13027
Dose limited toxicities evaluated with NCI-CTC AE v5.0, Incidence of dose limited toxicities and associated dose of YL-13027, within 28 days after the first dose|Adverse events evaluated by NCI CTCAE v5.0, Incidence of adverse events and associated dose of YL-13027, from the first dose to within 30 days after the last dose
Plasma concentration of YL-13027, This composite endpoint will measure the plasma concentration of YL-13027, within 56 days after the first dose|Objective response rate, the proportion of subjects who have a Complete Response or Partial Response, within 30 days after the last dose|Disease control rate, the proportion of subjects who have a Complete Response or Partial Response, within 30 days after the last dose
This is a open-label, single-center, dose-escalation, phase I study of YL-13027 comprised of a dose escalation part and a dose expansion part in subjects with advanced stage solid tumors. The study will investigate the tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and efficacy of YL-13027, and will define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of YL-13027 using an accelerated titration test and 3+3 design. a dose expansion part will identify the recommended phase 2 dose. YL-13027 is an orally bioavailable small molecule that inhibits protein serine/threonine kinase of activin receptor-like kinase 5 (ALK5) and blocks intracellular signaling of TGF-Î² by inhibiting the phosphorylation of ALK5 substrates. In this clinical trial, YL-13027 is given orally daily. A treatment cycle is defined as 28 days. Adverse events (AEs) were graded by NCI-CTCAE V5.0. Efficacy was evaluated according to RECIST V1.1.
