Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy Containing Paclitaxel&Cisplatin With/Without Tarceva in Locally Advanced Esophageal Cancer
This study is multi-center randomized phase III one to evaluate the difference in local-control and survival rate between patients receiving concurrent chemoradiotherapy combined Tarceva or not.
Esophageal Cancer
DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Tarceva|RADIATION: Radiotherapy|RADIATION: Radiotherapy
overall survival, failure: death from any cause, five years after enrollment
Progression-free survival, Failure: occurrence of local or regional progression, distant metastases, or death from any cause, five years after enrollment|local-regional control rate, Failure: occurrence of local or regional progression, three years after enrollment|Adverse events, assessed by RTOG Acute Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria and RTOG/EORTC Late Radiation Morbidity Scoring Schema, five years after enrollment|Health-related quality of life, assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Esophageal (FACT-E), five years after enrollment
For the esophageal carcinoma in II\~III stage, routine dosage of Paclitaxel and platinum medicine chemotherapy concurrently radical radiotherapy is worthy to be studied. On this base, we advanced approach the enlarged field radiotherapy and the intervention of Tarceva. And we approach the therapeutic effect for this method theoretically, which may give a further reasonable guidance for the clinical therapy.
