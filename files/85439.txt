Combined Immunotherapies in Metastatic ER+ Breast Cancer
Women with Hormone Receptor (HR)+ Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor (HER)2- metastatic breast cancer are eligible to a randomized trial. Patients receiving standard first line therapy for metastatic HR+ Breast cancer(BC) (letrozole+palbociclib) are randomly assigned to also receive Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy(SBRT) to each metastatic lesion.
