BIOLOGICAL: SHR-1210|BIOLOGICAL: CIK cells
Progression-free survival, PFS will be calculated from initiation of treatment until first progression, and patients alive in stable state will be censored at the time of last contact., 3 year
In the experimental group, patients received Camrelizumab injection (SHR-1210) 200mg d1, CIK cells 1x10\^10 d14; Q3W, for 4 cycles; then Camrelizumab injection maintenance treatment for 2 years. In the control group, patients received Camrelizumab injection 200mg d1, Q3W, for 2 years.
