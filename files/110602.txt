Phase II Study of Bevacizumab, Pemetrexed and Carboplatin as First-Line Therapy in Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma
The primary objective is to assess antitumor activity of the combination of bevacizumab, pemetrexed and carboplatin, in terms of time to progression.
Mesothelioma
DRUG: Bevacizumab, Pemetrexed, Carboplatin
Time to progression (TTP) from first day of treatment until first observation of disease progression or death due to any cause or the last date the patient was known to be progression free or alive., At the end of study
Response rate (RR) assessed according to modified RECIST criteria for Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma., Two months after the end of enrollment|Overall survival (OS) computed as the time between the first day of treatment and the date of death or the last date the patient was known to be alive., At the end of study
Secondary endpoints are to evaluate:

* the objective response rate (RR) of the combination;
* the toxicity and the safety profile of the combination;
* the duration of response (RD) and time to treatment failure (TTF);
* the overall survival (OS)
* RR, TTP and OS according to baseline plasma VEGF levels (introduced with Amendment 1 dated 8/11/2007)
