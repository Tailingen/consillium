HMPL-453 (FGFR Inhibitor) in Combination With Chemotherapy or Anti-PD-1 Antibody in Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a phase Ib/II clinical study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of HMPL-453 combined with chemotherapy or anti-PD-1 antibody in patients with advanced solid tumors.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: HMPL-453|DRUG: gemcitabine and cisplatin|DRUG: toripalimab|DRUG: Docetaxel
Safety and tolerability(Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs)), DLT, TEAEs and SAEs, 6 months after the last patient enrolled|Preliminary efficacy/Objective response rate (ORR), Objective response rate (ORR) in patients with the selected tumors along with certain FGFR gene alterations, up to 2 years
Efficacy/Progression-free survival (PFS), the duration between the enrollment date and the first disease progression (PD) or death (whichever comes first)., up to 2 years|disease control rate (DCR), The incidence of complete response, partial response and stable disease, up to 2 years|time to response (TTR), The period from the date of enrollment to the date when the criteria for complete response or partial response was first measured (first record shall prevail)., up to 2 years|duration of response (DoRï¼‰, The duration between the date the criteria for complete response or partial response was first measured (first record shall prevail) and the date of disease recurrence or progression as objectively recorded, up to 2 years|overall survival (OS), The period from date of enrollment to date of death, up to 2 years
The study includes a dose escalation phase and a dose-expansion phase.

Patients with advanced solid tumor will be enrolled in the dose escalation phase to assess the tolerability, safety, and PK profile of HMPL-453 monotherapy or combination therapy.

Patients with specific types of advanced or metastatic tumors harboring certain FGFR gene alterations will be enrolled in the dose expansion phase to assess the preliminary efficacy of HMPL-453 combination therapy.
