On the Cyberknife Dose Fraction of Liver Cancer Treatment
The research aims to the primary hepatic carcinoma patients whose diameter of the single tumor is equal or less than 5cm.By supervising the changes of liver function, Child-Pugh score, ICG-R15 value, secondary reaction, incidence rate of RILD during and after the radiotherapy, meanwhile combining the outcome of the progression of disease and the condition of survival quality, the optimum proposal could be obtained and apply to clinic thus make the treatment safe, effective and personalized.

RADIATION: Dose fraction forms
Local control rate, Local control illustrates the time from the tumor appearance to progress (the diameter more than or equal to 1.5 times of original) .The ratio of the number of the local control patients to the whole number of patients is local control rate., From date of the participants completing the therapy until the date of first documented progression, assessed up to 36 months.|Overall survival rate, Overall survival rate means the ratio of the number of patients who are alive to the whole patients after the treatment., From date of the participants diagnosed until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 36 months.
RILD rate, the rate of radiotherapy induced liver disease, From the date of radiotherapy completion until the 4 months after therapy,up to 6 months.|Child-Pugh score, By testing the liver function,coagulation function and ascites,we could calculate the Child-Pugh score,which reflect the liver function roundly., From the date of radiotherapy completion until the 4 months after therapy,up to 6 months.|the value of ICG R15, It means the indocyanine green retention rate at 15 minutes,which reflects the liver reserve., From the date of radiotherapy completion until the 4 months after therapy,up to 6 months.
