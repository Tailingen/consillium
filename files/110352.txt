Efficacy and Safety of Apatinib as Third-line Therapy for Primary Pulmonary Lymphoepithelioid Carcinoma
Currently, there is no standard treatment for primary pulmonary lymphoepithelioid carcinoma. Apatinib is a new kind of Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). A disease-control rate of 75% was found in lung cancer patients in a phase II clinical study. Therefore, researchers hope to explore the efficacy and safety of apatinib in the treatment of primary pulmonary lymphoepithelioid carcinoma.

This study is a prospective, exploratory clinical trial. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of apatinib monotherapy in the treatment of primary pulmonary lymphoepithelioid carcinoma.

Thirty-three cases of pulmonary lymphoepithelioid carcinoma were enrolled in this study.

The primary endpoint was median progression-free survival.
