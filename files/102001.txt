This was a single-arm, multi-centeric Phase IIIb study provided pediatric/young adult patients with r/r B-cell ALL the opportunity to be treated with CTL019. The main purpose of this study was to assess the safety of CTL019 for up to 12 months after the CTL019 infusion. The study had the following sequential phases for all patients: Screening including leukapheresis, Pre-Treatment (Cell Product Preparation and Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy), Treatment and Follow-up, and Long-Term Follow-Up (LTFU). The end of study (EOS) was defined as the last patient's last visit, which was the last patient's Month 12 evaluation, or the time of premature withdrawal. All patients were followed in this study for up to 12 months after the CTL019 infusion.
