ExAblate (MRgFUS) Treatment of Metastatic Bone Tumors for the Palliation of Pain
A Pivotal Study to Evaluate the Effectiveness and Safety of ExAblate Treatment of Metastatic Bone and Multiple Myeloma Tumors for the Palliation of Pain in Patients Who are not Candidates for Radiation Therapy
Bone Metastases|Multiple Myeloma
DEVICE: ExAblate MRfFUS|DEVICE: Sham
Number of Responders, Using the Numerical Rating Score (NRS) for pain (0 being no pain and 10 being worst imaginable pain), each subject was rated as a Responder or Non-responder. A responder is defined as a subject with a reduction in NRS worst score from baseline of two (2) or more points, and no increase in pain medication use., 3 months post treatment
Number of Participants With a Change in Medication Use, Medication Use change reported from baseline until of study. Medication use is quantified by "morphine equivalent usage" (measured separately from Responder/Non-responder definition for the primary endpoint), 3 months post treatment|Quality of Life (QOL) as Measured by Change in Bodily Pain Inventory (BPI) From Baseline, The BPI-QOL questionnaire is designed to show the severity and interference of pain in the lives of patients. This is a 7-item questionnaire that asks respondents the extent to which pain interferes with their general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep and enjoyment of life using a 0-10 numerical rating scale in which 0 represents 'does not interfere' and 10 indicates 'completely interferes'. Responses to the 7 items are averaged to form the pain interference scale score. Lower scores are better, showing less interference in daily activities while higher scores show more interference and hence worse outcomes., 3 months post treatment
