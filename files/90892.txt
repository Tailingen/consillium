Xpede Clinical Study
The purpose of this clinical study is to confirm the efficacy and safety of the Kyphon®Xpede™ Bone Cement in human use in China.
Pathological Fracture of Vertebra Due to Secondary Osteoporosis (Disorder)|Pathological Fracture of Vertebra Due to Neoplastic Disease (Disorder)
DEVICE: Xpede™ Bone Cement|DEVICE: Mendec Spine Bone Cement
The Change of Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) Score From Baseline at 6 Months Postoperative, NRS is used for rating patient pain intensity from 0-10, with a score of 0 representing "no pain" and a score of 10 representing "pain as bad as it could be.", Baseline and 6 months|The Change of Index Vertebral Body Angle From Baseline at 6 Months, Vertebral body angle is defined the angle formed by lines drawn parallel to the superior endplate of the fractured vertebral body and the inferior endplate of the fractured vertebral body for each fractured vertebral body., Baseline and 6 months
The Change of NRS Score From Baseline at 1 Day and 3 Months, NRS is used for rating patient pain intensity from 0-10, with a score of 0 representing "no pain" and a score of 10 representing "pain as bad as it could be.", Baseline, 1 day, and 3 months|The Change of Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) Score From Baseline at 1 Day, 3 Months, and 6 Months, ODI Questionnaire is used to assess patient back function. The ODI score ranges from 0-100. The best score is 0 (no disability) and worst is 100 (maximum disability)., Baseline, 1 day, 3 months, and 6 months|The Change of SF-36 From Baseline at 1 Day, 3 Months, and 6 Months, The Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) is used to assess general health status. The SF-36 results were summarized into two components, a physical component summary (PCS) and a mental component summary (MCS). The score for PCS/MCS is between 0 and 100, with higher scores denoting better quality of life., Baseline, 1 day, 3 months, and 6 months|Change in Vertebral Body Height at 1 Day, 3 Months, and 6 Months, Vertebral Body Height in the lateral projection will be measured at each treated vertebra as well as the next adjacent vertebrae (superior and inferior) without fracture and reported in millimeters.

Vertebral Body Height is the distance between comparable points on the superior and inferior endplates of the vertebral body at the posterior (Hp), midline (Hm) and anterior (Ha) locations。, 1 day, 3 months, and 6 months|Change in Vertebral Body Angle From Baseline at 1 Day and 3 Months, Vertebral body angle is defined the angle formed by lines drawn parallel to the superior endplate of the fractured vertebral body and the inferior endplate of the fractured vertebral body for each fractured vertebral body., Baseline, 1 day and 3 months|Number of Participants With Adverse Events Reported Through 6 Months, Adverse events reported through 6 months, in particular, the following events will be reported:

* Bone Cement Implantation Syndrome;
* Bone Cement leakage;
* Vertebral body compression fracture;
* Adjacent vertebral body fracture;, 6 months
The purpose of this clinical study is to confirm the efficacy and safety of the Kyphon®Xpede™ Bone Cement in human use in China.
