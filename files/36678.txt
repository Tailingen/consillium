Naxitamab and Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) Combined With Isotretinoin for Maintenance Treatment of Patients With High-Risk Neuroblastoma in First Complete Response.
This is a single-arm, multicenter clinical trial conducted in patients ≥ 12 months of age with high-risk neuroblastoma in first complete response. 62 patients will be enrolled to receive naxitamab + GM-CSF in combination with isotretinoin.

In line with post-consolidation maintenance treatment of high-risk neuroblastoma, this trial will include patients with high-risk neuroblastoma in first complete response. Patients must have completed a multimodal frontline regimen (induction and consolidation) and have achieved complete response (positive bone marrow minimal residual disease as assessed by RTqPCR is allowed) following the multi agent induction and consolidation therapy.
