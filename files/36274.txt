Elastographic and Ultrasonographic Evaluation of Patients With Breast Cancer Related Lymphedema
The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of shear-wave elastography for the diagnosis and staging of breast cancer related lymphedema by assessing the skin and subcutaneous tissues of the arm and forearm, which could serve as a reference standard and be more easily applicable in daily life; and to investigate the relationship between the patients' symptoms and elastographic measurements.

B Mode Ultrasonography Measurements, Arm and forearm skin and subcutaneous tissue thicknesses in milimetres evaluated by B mode USG, Day 0|Shear Wave Elastography Measurements, Arm and forearm skin and subcutaneous tissue stiffness in kilopascal evaluated by Shear wave elastography, Day 0|B Mode Ultrasonography Measurements, Arm and forearm skin and subcutaneous tissue SEG and SEFS grades evaluated in echogenicity grade system by B mode USG, Day 0
Association of USG and SWE Measurements With Symptoms, It is the relationship between the parameters evaluated by USG ( thickness in milimetres echogenity according to grading system) and SWE (stiffness in kilopascal) and the pain, tension, heaviness and stiffness scoring in which symptoms in numeric scale., Day 0|Association of USG and SWE Measurements With Functionality, It is the relationship between the parameters evaluated by USG (thickhickness in milimetres , echogenity according to grading system) and SWE (stiffness in kilopascal) and QUİCK DASH Questionnaire Score, Day 0|Association of USG and SWE Measurements With Participation İn Daily Life, It is the relationship between the parameters evaluated by USG (thickness in milimetres ,echogenity according to grading system) and SWE (stiffness in kilopascal) and The Life İmpact Questionnaire Scale, Day 0|Association of USG and SWE Measurements With Volume Measurements, It is the volume measurement of both arms of the patients in cubic centimetre., Day 0
Both upper extremities of 72 patients with lymphedema and 72 healthy upper extremities were included in the study. The patients' demographic and clinical data were recorded. The thickness and echogenicity of the skin and subcutaneous tissues of all extremities were evaluated with B-mode ultrasonography, and the stiffness of the skin and subcutaneous tissues was evaluated with shear-wave elastography. The lymphedema arm and the healthy arm of the patients were compared both with each other and with the data of the control group. Interobserver and intraobserver reliability analysis was performed for ultrasonography and elastography measurements. The patients' pain, tension, weight, and stiffness symptoms associated with lymphedema were questioned using a numerical scale. The patients' functionality and participation in daily life activities were evaluated with the Quick DASH and Life Impact Index questionnaires. The relationship between these findings and elastographic and ultrasonographic parameters was analyzed.
