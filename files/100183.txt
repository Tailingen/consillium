E7050 in Combination With Sorafenib Versus Sorafenib Alone as First Line Therapy in Participants With Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to determine whether patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who receive either E7050 administered with Sorafenib or Sorafenib alone experience greater benefit (cancer responds to treatment) when E7050 is administered with Sorafenib.

ECOG has 6 levels (0-5). Level 0 is the best status (fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease performance without restriction); Level 1 is mildly restricted (Restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory ad able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature, e.g. light house work, office work); Level 2 is more restricted (Ambulatory and capable of all selfcare but unable to carry out any work activities; up and about more than 50% of waking hours); Level 3 is restricted (Capable of only limited selfcare; confined to bed or chair more than 50% of waking hours); Level 4 is highly restricted (completely disabled; cannot carry on any selfcare; totally confined to bed or chair); and Level 5 is death (dead)., From first dose of study drug up to 30 days after last dose of study drug (up to approximately 3 years 11 months)|Phase 2: Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Change From Baseline in Laboratory Values, From first dose of study drug up to 30 days after last dose of study drug (up to approximately 3 years 11 months)|Phase 2: Number of Participants With Markedly Abnormal Change From Baseline in Electrocardiograms (ECGs) Parameters, From first dose of study drug up to 30 days after last dose of study drug (up to approximately 3 years 11 months)
Phase 2: Time to Progression (TTP), TTP was defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of PD of such participants disease based on independent assessments according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v) 1.1. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase or 5 millimeter (mm) increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions (taking as reference the smallest sum on study) recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions. TTP was estimated and analyzed using Kaplan-Meier (K-M) method., From the date of randomization until the date of PD (up to approximately 3 years 11 months)|Phase 2: Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization of a participant until (1) the date of first documented progression (2) the date of such participant's death due to any cause based on independent assessments according to RECIST v. 1.1. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase or 5 mm increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions (taking as reference the smallest sum on study) recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions. PFS was estimated and analyzed using KM method., From the date of randomization until the earlier of the following two events: the date of PD or the date of death (Up to approximately 3 years 11 months)|Phase 2: Percentage of Participants With PFS at Week 12, The PFS rate at week 12 was defined as the percentage of participants who were still alive without disease progression at 12 weeks from the date of randomization. PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization of a participant until (1) the date of first documented progression (2) the date of such participant's death due to any cause based on independent assessments according to RECIST v. 1.1. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase or 5 mm increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions (taking as reference the smallest sum on study) recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions., At 12 weeks|Phase 2: Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of death. Participants were censored at the date of last known alive. OS was analyzed using K-M method., From the date of randomization until the date of death (Up to approximately 3 years 11 months)|Phase 2: Percentage of Participants With Overall Response, Overall response rate was defined as percentage of participants with best confirmed response (CR) or partial response (PR) assessed by investigator per RECIST v1.1. A confirmatory scan was required after no less than 4 weeks and no later than 8 weeks, starting on the date that the response was first recorded. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions (non-lymph nodes). All pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have a reduction in their short axis to less than (\<)10 mm. PR was defined as at least a 30 percent (%) decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., From the date of randomization until disease progression or death (Up to approximately 3 years 11 months)
This open-label, multicenter, randomized study will consist of a Phase Ib: a safety run-in period with 3 ascending doses of E7050 in combination with sorafenib; and a Phase II portion: a randomized 2-arm period. Approximately 95 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma will be enrolled in the study (10-15 patients in the Phase Ib portion and 80 patients in the Phase II portion). Patients will only participate in either the Phase Ib or the Phase II portion of the study. In both Phase Ib and phase II, Patients will receive study treatment (E7050 plus sorafenib or sorafenib alone) until the occurrence of progressive disease (PD)for approximately six 28-day cycles (24 weeks). After 6 cycles. ath the discretion of the Investigator and in consultation with the Medical Monitor, patients who are experiencing clinical benefit may continue E7050, with or without sorafenib (Arm 1), or may continue sorafenib alone (Arm 2), depending on the original randomization treatment arm, for as long as clinical benefit is sustained and the treatment is well tolerated. Patients will be followed until death following completion of therapy.
