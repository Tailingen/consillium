Effectiveness of Cryotherapy Study for Prostate Cancer
This is a single-centre prospective, non-randomized trial to investigate the efficacy of cryotherapy in patients with localized prostate cancer.The aim of study is to investigate the safety profile of cryotherapy in the treatment of prostate cancer and to evaluate the oncological control of prostate cancer by means of cryotherapy focal treatment.

Conventional treatment options for localized prostate cancer include prostatectomy, radiotherapy and active surveillance. However, prostatectomy and radiotherapy carry certain degree of morbidity, including the risks of urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction and injury to the structures in the proximity. Active surveillance carries the risk of disease progression and psychological distress to the patients. Focal therapy employs the concept of only destroying the significant lesion, resulting in disease cure and improved functional outcome. Among the different options of focal therapy, cryotherapy is one of the most commonly employed energy sources. It exerts its effect through freezing of tissue and vascular injury, leading to destruction of cancer tissue. Our study aims at assess the safety and effectiveness of such treatment in prostate cancer management
