PTK787 + Trastuzumab for HER2 Overexpressing Metastatic Breast Cancer
HER2 gene amplification increases VEGF production in breast cancers; combined inhibition of HER2 and VEGF enhances response in xenograft models. The upregulation of VEGF in HER2-overexpressing breast cancers may contribute to the aggressive phenotype observed in HER2-positive breast cancer. New therapeutics targeting VEGF and/or its receptors may enhance the efficacy of trastuzumab monotherapy.

This trial will investigate the safety and efficacy of combined HER2 and VEGF inhibition.

DRUG: PTK787|DRUG: Trastuzumab
Phase I Cohorts:, 18 months|The primary objective is to ensure the safety and tolerability of the combination of Trastuzumab and PTK787,, 18 months|Phase II Cohorts:, 18 months|To assess response rate of PTK787 combined with trastuzumab in patients with newly diagnosed HER2 overexpressing, 18 months
Phase II Cohorts:, 12 months|To assess the safety and tolerability of PTK787 combined with trastuzumab, 12 months|To assess the time to progression and clinical benefit of PTK787 combined with trastuzumab, 12 months
OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

PTK787 daily plus trastuzumab 4 mg/kg IV week 1, followed by 2 mg/kg weekly with disease evaluation every other cycle.

Patients may continue treatment until disease progression or toxicity intervenes.
