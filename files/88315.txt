Treatment With Bendamustine, Ofatumumab and MethylPrednisolone in Relapsed B-CLL
ICLL01 The BOMP trial: Phase II study of salvage treatment with Bendamustine, Ofatumumab and MethylPrednisolone (BOMP) in relapsed B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL).

A study of the GOELAMS / GCFLLC-MW intergroup
B-cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (B-CLL)
DRUG: BOMP
Efficacy: Response rate according to IWCLL 2008 guidelines, Complete response rate (CR) at 6 cycles of BOMP according to IWCLL 2008 criteria Hallek 2008, 9 months
Tolerance and safety, Tolerance and safety of the BOMP regimen according to the CTC criteria, 57 months
Available datas suggest that a combination of bendamustine, ofatumumab and high dose steroids (the BOMP regimen) appears meaningful and likely to induce a high response rate in patients with relapsed CLL, including those who have relapsed after modern 1st line immuno-chemotherapy combinations and those who are fludarabine-refractory. The BOMP trial will address the complete response rate as its main objective. The results of bendamustine and rituximab CLL2M trial will serve of a comparator for the BOMP trial. Among secondary objectives, an extensive study of the p53 pathway (deletion 17p, TP53 mutational status and p53 function) will be performed and its impact on response and survival will be analyzed.
