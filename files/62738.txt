A First-in-Human Trial of Safety and Efficacy of GEN1078 in Participants With Solid Tumors
The purpose of this trial is to measure the following in participants with solid cancers who receive GEN1078.

* The side effects seen with GEN1078
* What the body does with GEN1078 once it is administered
* What GEN1078 does to the body once it is administered
* How well GEN1078 works against advanced solid tumors

Trial details include:

* The estimated trial duration is 8 months for an individual participant (the trial duration may vary for each participant).
* The treatment duration will be an estimated 3-month treatment period (the duration of treatment may vary for each participant).
* The visit frequency will be daily or visits every few days for the first few months.

All participants will receive active drug; no one will be given placebo.
Malignant Solid Tumor
DRUG: GEN1078
Dose Escalation: Number of Participants With Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs), Toxicities will be graded for severity according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) criteria version 5.0, except for cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) which will be evaluated according to the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) criteria., Up to 21 days|Dose Escalation: Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), From first dose until the end of the safety follow-up period (30 days after the last dose)|Dose Expansion: Confirmed Objective Response Rate (ORR), Confirmed ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with confirmed best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) v1.1 as assessed by the investigator., Up to approximately 5 years
Dose-Escalation and Expansion: Clearance (CL) of GEN1078, Predose and postdose at multiple timepoints up to end of treatment (approximately 3 months)|Dose-Escalation and Expansion: Volume of Distribution (Vd) of GEN1078, Predose and postdose at multiple timepoints up to end of treatment (approximately 3 months)|Dose-Escalation and Expansion: Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve from Time Zero to Last Quantifiable Concentration (AUC0-last) of GEN1078, Predose and postdose at multiple timepoints up to end of treatment (approximately 3 months)|Dose-Escalation and Expansion: Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve from Time Zero to Infinity (AUC0-∞) of GEN1078, Predose and postdose at multiple timepoints up to end of treatment (approximately 3 months)|Dose-Escalation and Expansion: Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of GEN1078, Predose and postdose at multiple timepoints up to end of treatment (approximately 3 months)|Dose-Escalation and Expansion: Time to Reach Cmax (Tmax) for GEN1078, Predose and postdose at multiple timepoints up to end of treatment (approximately 3 months)|Dose-Escalation and Expansion: Predose Concentration for GEN1078, Predose up to end of treatment (approximately 3 months)|Dose-Escalation and Expansion: Terminal Half-life (t½) of GEN1078, Predose and postdose at multiple timepoints up to end of treatment (approximately 3 months)|Dose-Escalation and Expansion: Number of Participants with Anti-drug Antibodies (ADAs), Up to approximately 5 years|Dose Escalation: Confirmed ORR, Confirmed ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with confirmed BOR of CR or PR based on RECIST v1.1 as assessed by the investigator., Up to approximately 5 years|Dose-Escalation and Expansion: Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from first documentation of response (CR or PR) to the date of the first documented progression or death whichever occurs earlier based on RECIST v1.1 as assessed by the investigator., Up to approximately 5 years|Dose-Escalation and Expansion: Disease Control Rate (DCR), The DCR is defined as the percentage of participants with confirmed BOR of CR, PR, or Stable Disease (SD) according to RECIST v1.1 as assessed by investigator., Up to approximately 5 years|Dose-Escalation and Expansion: Time to Response (TTR), TTR based on investigator assessment is defined as the time from Cycle 1, Day 1 (C1D1) to first documentation of objective response (CR or PR) in participants achieving PR or CR according to RECIST v1.1 as assessed by investigator., Up to approximately 5 years|Dose Expansion: Number of Participants With AEs, From first dose until the end of the safety follow-up period (30 or 60 days after the last dose)
