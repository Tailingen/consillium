Calculated at 9 months using the Kaplan-Meier technique|Progression-free Survival (PFS) Rate at 12 Months Based on Independent Central Review (ICR), PFS based on ICR is defined as the time from date of enrolment until the date of objective disease progression or death (by any cause in the absence of progression) regardless of whether the patient withdraws from therapy or receives another anti-cancer therapy prior to progression, Tumour assessments every 6 weeks from 1st dose of treatment until Recist 1.1 defined radiological progressive disease. Calculated at 12 months using the Kaplan-Meier technique|Progression-free Survival (PFS) Rate at 15 Months Based on Independent Central Review (ICR), PFS based on ICR is defined as the time from date of enrolment until the date of objective disease progression or death (by any cause in the absence of progression) regardless of whether the patient withdraws from therapy or receives another anti-cancer therapy prior to progression, Tumour assessments every 6 weeks from 1st dose of treatment until Recist 1.1 defined radiological progressive disease. Calculated at 15 months using the Kaplan-Meier technique|Progression-free Survival (PFS) Rate at 18 Months Based on Independent Central Review (ICR), PFS based on ICR is defined as the time from date of enrolment until the date of objective disease progression or death (by any cause in the absence of progression) regardless of whether the patient withdraws from therapy or receives another anti-cancer therapy prior to progression, Tumour assessments every 6 weeks from 1st dose of treatment until Recist 1.1 defined radiological progressive disease. Calculated at 18 months using the Kaplan-Meier technique|Progression-free Survival (PFS) Rate at 21 Months Based on Independent Central Review (ICR), PFS based on ICR is defined as the time from date of enrolment until the date of objective disease progression or death (by any cause in the absence of progression) regardless of whether the patient withdraws from therapy or receives another anti-cancer therapy prior to progression, Tumour assessments every 6 weeks from 1st dose of treatment until Recist 1.1 defined radiological progressive disease. Calculated at 21 months using the Kaplan-Meier technique|Disease Control Rate (DCR) Based on Independent Central Review (ICR), Disease control rate based on ICR according to RECIST version 1.1 was defined as the rate of best objective response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD), Tumour assessments every 6 weeks from 1st dose of treatment until Recist 1.1 defined radiological progressive disease. Assessed up to a maximum of 22 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR) Based on Independent Central Review (ICR) at Week 12, Disease control rate based on ICR according to RECIST version 1.1 was defined as the rate of best objective response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) for at least 11 weeks (ie 12 weeks - 1 week to allow for an early assessment within the assessment window), Tumour assessments every 6 weeks from 1st dose of treatment until Recist 1.1 defined radiological progressive disease. DCR assessed at Week 12|Duration of Response (DoR) Based on Independent Central Review (ICR), DoR defined as the time from the date of first documented OR (confirmed CR or confirmed PR) until date of documented progression (PD) or death in the absence of progression based on investigator assessments by using RECIST version 1.1, Tumour assessments every 6 weeks from 1st dose of treatment until Recist 1.1 defined radiological progressive disease.
