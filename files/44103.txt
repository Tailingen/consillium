Exercise During and After Neoadjuvant Rectal Cancer Treatment
This study is designed to investigate if aerobic exercise during and after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NACRT) can improve outcomes for rectal cancer patients.
Rectal Cancer

Change in Cardiorespiratory fitness, VO2 peak, pre-NACRT (baseline), post-NACRT (an average of 6 weeks)
Cardiorespiratory fitness, VO2 peak, pre-surgery (an average of 12 weeks)|Functional fitness, Senior's Fitness Test, pre-NACRT (baseline), post-NACRT (an average of 6 weeks), pre-surgery (an average of 12 weeks)|Generic quality of life, European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer core 30-item questionnaire, pre-NACRT (baseline), post-NACRT (an average of 6 weeks), pre-surgery (an average of 12 weeks)|Disease specific quality of life, European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer questionnaire module for colorectal cancer, pre-NACRT (baseline), post-NACRT (an average of 6 weeks), pre-surgery (an average of 12 weeks)|Symptom burden, M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory, pre-NACRT (baseline), post-NACRT (an average of 6 weeks), pre-surgery (an average of 12 weeks)|Exercise motivation, Theory of planned behaviour, pre-NACRT (baseline), post-NACRT (an average of 6 weeks), pre-surgery (an average of 12 weeks)|Eligibility rate, Number of eligible patients divided by the number of rectal cancer patients scheduled to receive long-course NACRT, up to 20 months|Recruitment rate, Number of patients randomized divided by the number of eligible patients, up to 20 months|Exercise adherence rate, Exercise adherence during NACRT will be assessed by the number of exercise sessions attended out of 18 as well as adherence to the intensity and duration of the HIT intervals. Exercise adherence to the unsupervised exercise after NACRT will be assessed by self-report using the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise., post-NACRT (an average of 6 weeks), pre-surgery (an average of 12 weeks)|Follow-up assessment rate, Number of patients in each group completing the objective outcomes (cardiorespiratory fitness and functional fitness) and patient-reported outcomes (quality of life, symptom burden) at each timepoint., post-NACRT (an average of 6 weeks), pre-surgery (an average of 12 weeks)|Safety: Adverse event rate, Number of serious adverse events that occur during exercise testing or the supervised exercise sessions, post-NACRT (an average of 6 weeks), pre-surgery (an average of 12 weeks)

The EXERT trial is a single-center, prospective, two-armed, phase II randomized controlled trial designed to test the preliminary efficacy of exercise training in this clinical setting and to further evaluate its feasibility and safety. Participants will be 60 rectal cancer patients scheduled to receive long-course NACRT followed by total mesorectal excision. Participants will be randomly assigned to exercise training or usual care. Participants in the exercise training group will be asked to complete three supervised, high-intensity interval training sessions/week during NACRT and ≥ 150 min/week of unsupervised, moderate-to-vigorous-intensity, continuous exercise training after NACRT prior to surgery. Participants in the usual care group will be asked not to increase their exercise from baseline. Assessments will be completed pre NACRT, post NACRT, and pre surgery. The primary endpoint will be cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2 peak) at the post-NACRT time point assessed by a graded exercise test. Secondary endpoints will include functional fitness, quality of life, and symptom management. Exploratory clinical endpoints will include treatment toxicities, treatment completion, treatment response, and surgical complications.
