Study of CG0070 Given in Combination With Pembrolizumab, in Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer, Unresponsive to Bacillus Calmette-Guerin
To evaluate the activity of intravesical administration of CG0070 and intravenous administration of Pembrolizumab in patients with tissue pathology-confirmed non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) who have Bacillus-Calmette-Guerin (BCG) unresponsive disease with carcinoma in situ (CIS) with or without Ta/T1 papillary disease.
Non Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: CG0070|BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab Injection|OTHER: n-dodecyl-B-D-maltoside
Complete response rate in patients, Percentage of patients with a complete response as defined by FDA guidance document dated February 2018 for NMIBC., 12 months
Incidence of adverse events when CG0070 administered intravesically when combined with pembrolizumab., Percentage of patients with adverse events by grade as determined by NCI CTCAE v5.0, 12 months|Median duration of response (DoR), Median duration of response in patients with a CR or PR, 12 months|Median overall survival (OS), Median overall survival in months in patients, 12 months|Median progression free survival, Median duration of progression free survival of patients, 12 months
An opened label trial designed to evaluate CG0070 and DDM in combination with Pembrolizumab in patients with NMIBC who have failed prior BCG therapy.

The target population of 37 subjects with CIS with or without concomitant high-grade Ta or T1 papillary disease will be enrolled.

BCG failure is defined as persistent or recurrent disease within 12 months of completion of adequate BCG therapy.
