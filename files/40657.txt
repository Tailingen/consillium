A Phase 0 Study of AZD1775 in Recurrent GBM Patients
This study would test how much of the new drug, AZD1775, is present in tumor, blood, and skin after one dose of the drug.

The purpose of the study is not to treat the tumor, but to see if the drug actually gets into the tumor cells. This study does not replace routine cancer treatment.
Glioblastoma|GBM
BIOLOGICAL: AZD1775
Plasma concentration of AZD1775 following single dose of AZD1775, Will be summarized using descriptive statistics, at baseline, 2-4, 8-12, and 22-26 hours following single dose of AZD1775|Intratumoral concentration of AZD1775, Will be summarized using descriptive statistics, up to day of surgery
Degree of CDC2 (Tyr15) phosphorylation in tissue, Will be summarized using descriptive statistics, at baseline and up to 26 hours post dosing|Number of GBM cells in M-phase of cell cycle (PH3), Will be summarized using descriptive statistics, at baseline and up to 26 hours post dose AZD1775|Presence of double-strand DNA damage (Î³H2AX)., Will be summarized using descriptive statistics, at baseline and up to 26 hours post dose AZD1775
P53 mutation status, Will be summarized using descriptive statistics, up to time of surgery|Presence of checkpoint regulator genes in GBM specimens, checkpoint regulator genes in GBM specimens, up to time of surgery
Patients will be administered one dose of AZD1775 prior to surgical resection of their tumor. There will be 2 portions of this trial, referred to as Part 1 and Part 2. Part 1 will involve a dose escalation strategy where 3 separate doses (100, 200, and 400mg) will be evaluated. Each dose cohort will involve 4 patients. Surgery, with tissue harvest for determination of both tissue drug level and biomarker evaluation, will occur at 8 hrs post drug administration.

Part 2 will determine the potential tumor drug level and PD effects at various time intervals after drug administration of a single select drug dose. Currently, we are planning to use a dose (200 mg) that has been deemed safe when used in combination with cytotoxic therapy. However, if results from Part 1 suggest an alternate dose may be preferable, we will consider using that alternate dose in Part 2. Dosing will be followed by surgical resection at 2-4 hrs and at 22-26 hrs post dose.
