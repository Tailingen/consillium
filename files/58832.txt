Preoperative Hypnosis in Gynecology
The research hypotheses that preoperative formal hypnosis session reduces perioperative anxiety among women undergoing a hysterectomy for pelvic gynecological cancer. The key objective is to estimate the effect of preoperative hypnosis on preoperative anxiety among this population
Pelvic Gynecological Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Caregiver Accompaniment Time (CAT) + preoperative hypnosis session
evolution of anxiety, visual analog scale (from 0, no anxiety to 10, extreme anxiety), 1 month after the surgery
pain, numerical scale of pain (from 0, no pain, to 10, extreme pain), The day of the consultation with anesthesist, the day before the surgery, 2 days, an average of 12 days, and 1 month after the surgery|nausea and vomiting, frequency and intensity through an interview with a nurse, 2 days, an average of 12 days, and 1 month after the surgery|concomitant medication, concomitant medication within anxiolytic, antalgic, and/or antiemetic pharmaceutical classes (yes/no), The day of the consultation with anesthesist, the day before the surgery, 2 days, an average of 12 days, and 1 month after the surgery|medical history, chronic pathologies (e.g. arterial hypertension, type 2 diabetes) (yes/no), The day of the consultation with anesthesist|length of hospital stay, an average of 12 days after the surgery|hypnosis intervention feasibility (composite outcome), Compliance with the formal Hypnosis session checklist (Installation, pre-session interview, kinesthetic induction, dissociation, deepening, post-hypnotic suggestions and anchoring, return to normal wakefulness)

Other factors: proportion of refusals, proportion of abandoned, proportion of lost sight, after the hypnosis session (average of 1 week before the surgery)
Anxiety is present preoperatively in 40% of patients. The operated subjects are on average 20% more anxious than the general population, according to a study of 2013. Cancer as well as surgery modifying the body pattern and impairing femininity are risk factors for preoperative anxiety. Recent work in both children and adults has shown that significant levels of preoperative anxiety increase the risk of postoperative complications and the occurrence of postoperative emotional and behavioral disorders. The consequences of hysterectomy increase patients' anxiety, for fear of affecting femininity, and the modification of the body regimen. The prevention of preoperative anxiety in such population is therefore a major issue.
