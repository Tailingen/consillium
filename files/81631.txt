Apatinib in the Treatment of Patients With EGFR T790M-Negative NSCLC
This phase 2 study is designed to evaluate the safety and activity of apatinib,a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that selectively inhibits the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2, in combination with EGFR-TKI in NSCLC with T790M-negative after the failure of EGFR-TKI therapy.
