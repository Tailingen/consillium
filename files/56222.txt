Gene Mutations in Patients With Advanced Prostate Cancer That Is Not Responsive to Hormone Therapy
RATIONALE: Gene mutations may make prostate cancer cells unable to attach to androgens. This may permit the growth of prostate cancer. Gene testing may improve the identification of patients with advanced prostate cancer.

PURPOSE: Clinical trial to study the androgen receptor gene in patients with prostate cancer that is not responsive to hormone therapy.
Prostate Cancer
OTHER: mutation analysis
overall survival, Up to 10 years
response rate, Up to 10 years
OBJECTIVES:

1. the feasibility of collecting bone marrow biopsies from prostate cancer patients in a cooperative group setting
2. the incidence of marrow invasion by prostate tumor in random bone marrow biopsy
3. the influence of previous prostate radiation on obtaining prostate tumor
4. the frequency and type of AR mutations and
5. association of AR mutations with response to antiandrogen withdrawal.
