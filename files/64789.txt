Pharmacokinetics And Pharmacodynamics Of Lapatinib In Two Dosing Regimens In Treatment-naive Patients With Breast Cancer
This study will examine the inhibition of ErbB1 and ErbB2 phosphorylation and downstream mediators of tumor cell growth and survival tumor tissue in treatment-naive breast cancer patients for three dosing schedules of lapatinib.
Neoplasms, Breast
DRUG: lapatinib
Comparison of the effects of 3 dosing schedules of lapatinib on biomarkers involved in regulating tumor cell proliferation and survival in pre-treatment and post-treatment breast tumor tissue samples., biomarker analysis of tumor biopsies pre/post dose, subjects on study up to 15 days
Evaluation of adverse events and changes in lab values from pre-dose and post-dose. Assessment of safety & tolerability of lapatinib at multiple doses when administered to patients who have not have not been treated for breast tumors., safety assessments of labs, hematology labs, Electrocardiogram, vital signs, subjects on study up to 15 days
