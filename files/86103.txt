A Study of TRK-950 When Used in Combination With Ramucirumab and Paclitaxel in Patients With Gastric Cancer
This study will assess the efficacy, safety, optimal dose and ADA and NAbs development of TRK-950 at two separate dose levels in combination with ramucirumab and paclitaxel (RAM+PTX) as compared with RAM + PTX treatment alone in participants with gastric or gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma.

This study will assess and compare the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), optimal dose and anti-drug antibodies (ADA) and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) development of TRK-950 at two separate dose levels in combination with RAM + PTX as compared with RAM + PTX treatment alone in participants with gastric or gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma. The primary objective is progression free survival (PFS). Secondary objectives are overall survival, objective response rate, best overall response, duration of response, disease control rate, safety, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of TRK-950 when used in combination with RAM+PTX.
