Primary Chemotherapy by BCNU-TMZ Combination in Newly Diagnosed Anaplastic Oligodendrocytic Tumors: Phase II Trial With Translational Molecular Analysis
The first-line treatment of anaplastic oligodendrogliomas, radiotherapy exclusive or combined with PCV, will be defined by the pending results of phase III of the EORTC.

If the phase II study proposed here achieves its objective, it may help define a new treatment regimen that will be compared to the standard arm from phase III of the EORTC.

In addition, this study, by prospectively testing the predictive value of 1p and 19q deletions and of REGF amplification, may allow characterization of patients using these markers. If validated, this characterization can constitute a key element in any therapeutic evaluation (patient stratification), and potentially a major tool for medical decision support in these tumors.
