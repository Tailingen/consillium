Evaluation of Effects of Silymarin on Cisplatin Induced Nephrotoxicity in Upper Gastrointestinal Adenocarcinoma
Cisplatin is a potent chemotherapeutic agent that has been widely used to treat many solid tumours. acute renal failure, despite conservative fluid and electrolyte management, frequently reported adverse event and limiting cisplatin use. Silymarin, a flavonolignan complex isolated from Silybum marianum, has a strong antioxidant, hepatoprotective, anticancer and in animal model nephroprotective properties. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) protein is a promising biomarker to detect acute kidney injury due to cisplatin. Milk thistle extract inhibitory effects on epidermal growth factor receptor, vascular endothelial growth factor and insulin-like growth factor-I have shown in the previous in-vitro studies.The aim of present study,a randomized double-blind placebo- controlled clinical trial, to investigate the therapeutic effect of silymarin on cisplatin induced nephrotoxicity and it's impact on chemotherapy. Fifty-eight patients with diagnosed upper gastrointestinal tract carcinomas randomized to silymarin (420mg) or placebo plus chemotherapy \[cisplatin 50-60 mg/m2, 5-fluorouracil mg/m2, docetaxel 60-80 mg/m2 every 21 days\] for 63 day after inclusion. serum creatinin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum and urine electrolyte will be measured daily during chemotherapy.

changes in urine NGAL, serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)and caspase activity assessed up to 64 days.
Upper GI Cancer|Cisplatin Adverse Reaction
DRUG: Silymarin|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: chemotherapy
Urine concentration of NGAL, All subject receive silymarin at dose of 420mg or placebo in three dose for 65 consecutive day, urine NGAL concentration will be measured., up to 9 weeks
Changes in VEGF Serum concentration, To assess interaction between silymarin and cancer chemotherapy serum vascular endothelial growth factor will be measured., up to 9 weeks|Tissue activity of caspase 3, To assess interaction between silymarin and cancer chemotherapy Tissue activity of caspase 3will be measured., up to 9 weeks
This study will look for possible protective effects silymarin on kidney injury in patients receiving cisplatin.
