A Study Evaluating the Safety, Tolerance and Anti-tumor Activity of HBM1020 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the study drug HBM1020 which contains two parts. Part 1 will enroll solid tumor participants and Part 2 will enroll renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRC).
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: HBM1020
Proportion of subjects with dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), Number of subjects who experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) events during 21 days, From Day 1 until disease progression or Day 21, whichever comes first.
Adverse events (AEs), According to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0 (including vital signs, physical examinations, and abnormal laboratory parameters)., From the date of informed consent until safety follow-up Day 90.|Objective response rate (ORR), The proportion of subjects with best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST 1.1, Up to 2 years or until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, subject withdraw consent or investigator's decision, whichever occurs first.|Duration of response, The time interval from first occurrence of a documented objective response to the time of disease progression as determined by the Investigator using RECIST 1.1 or death from any cause, whichever comes first, Up to 2 years or until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, subject withdraw consent or investigator's decision, whichever occurs first.|Disease control rate, The proportion of subjects with a best overall response of CR, PR, or stable disease (SD), Up to 2 years or until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, subject withdraw consent or investigator's decision, whichever occurs first.|Duration of disease control, The time from the date of start of treatment to the date of disease progression or death for subjects who had CR or PR or SD during treatment, Up to 2 years or until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, subject withdraw consent or investigator's decision, whichever occurs first|Tumor shrinkage (The percentage of patients with tumor shrinkage), The greatest tumor shrinkage achieved at any follow-up assessment. Measured by radiological (computed tomography \[CT\]/Magnetic Resonance Imaging \[MRI\]) scanning until documented radiographic disease progression according to RECIST 1.1, or loss of clinical benefit after disease progression according to RECIST 1.1, Up to 2 years or until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, subject withdraw consent or investigator's decision, whichever occurs first.|Maximum serum concentration (Cmax), Maximum serum concentration, Up to 90 days after end of treatment.|Time to reach maximum serum concentration (Tmax), Time to reach maximum serum concentration, Up to 90 days after end of treatment.|Area under the serum concentration versus time curve from time zero to the dosing interval tau (AUC0-tau), area under the serum concentration versus time curve from time zero to the dosing interval tau, Up to 90 days after end of treatment.
This is a study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the study drug HBM1020, and to determine the maximum tolerated dose and/or recommended Phase 2 study dose of HBM1020. The study will also look at the anti-tumor activity of HBM1020.The study consists of 2 parts. In Part 1, patients are enrolled into different cohort doses in order to identify the appropriate recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) or maximum tolerated dose (MTD). In Part 2, participants with metastatic/unresectable RCC, CRC will receive the MTD and/or RP2D established in Part 1 of the study. In Part 1 and Part 2, participants will be administered treatment every 3 weeks.
