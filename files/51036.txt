A Study Investigating the Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy of ASP7517 in Subjects With Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and Relapsed/Refractory Higher Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability and to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and/or the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ASP7517.

This study also evaluated the clinical response of ASP7517 as well as other measures of anticancer activity of ASP7517.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)|Myelodysplastic Syndrome
BIOLOGICAL: ASP7517
Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), DLT was defined as any of the following events that occurred within 28 days starting with the first dose on cycle 1 day 1 (C1D1) and that was considered to be related to study drug. DLT was defined as follows:

* Grade 3 of more : non-hematologic AEs that are ≥ grade 3
* Confirmed Hy's law case
* New onset of grade 4 thrombocytopenia (with minimum of 2 grade worsening from baseline) within 24 hours of dosing
* Prolonged myelosuppression, defined as absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \< 500/microliter (μL) for more than 28 days off therapy and in the absence of evidence of active leukemia or MDS in the marrow or blood., Day 1 up to 28 days|Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) & Serious TEAE, An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE could therefore be any unfavorable \& unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. An AE was considered "serious" if, it resulted in any of the following outcomes: results in death; is life-threatening; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions; results in congenital anomaly, or birth defect; requires inpatient hospitalization; or leads to prolongation of hospitalization; other medically important events. TEAE was defined as an AE observed after starting administration of the study drug. TEAEs included both Serious and non-serious AEs., From first dose up to 43 months|Phase 2: Composite Complete Remission (CRc) Rate for Participants With R/R AML, Percentage of participants with CRc was reported. CRc:defined as rate of all complete \& incomplete remissions (CR + CR with incomplete platelet recovery \[CRp\] + CR with incomplete hematological recover \[Cri\]). CR: achieved morphologic leukemia-free state \& their bone marrow was regenerating normal hematopoietic cells. If absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1×10\^9/L, platelet count (PC) ≥ 100×10\^9/L, normal marrow differential \< 5% blasts, \& were red blood cell (RBC) and platelet transfusion independent (defined as 1 week without RBC transfusion \& platelet transfusion prior to disease assessment). There was no evidence of extramedullary leukemia or Auer rods \& blast counts in peripheral blood must be ≤ 2%. CRp: must achieve CR except for incomplete platelet recovery (\< 100×10\^9/L). CRi: must fulfil CR except for incomplete hematological recovery with residual neutropenia (ANC \< 1×10\^9/L), with or without complete platelet recovery. RBC and platelet transfusion independence not required., From first dose up to 43 months|Phase 2: Complete Remission + Bone Marrow Complete Remission + Partial Remission (CR + BM CR + PR) Rate for Participants With R/R Higher Risk MDS, Percentage of participants with CR+BM CR+ PR was reported. CR, BM CR and PR achieved for minimum of 4 weeks; CR: bone marrow: ≤ 5% myeloblasts with normal maturation of all cell Lines, peripheral blood evaluation (hemoglobin (Hb) ≥ 11 g/dL, platelets ≥ 100 × 10\^9/L, neutrophils ≥ 1.0 × 10\^9/L, 0% blasts in blood)

BM CR: bone marrow: ≤ 5% myeloblasts and decrease by ≥ 50% over pretreatment

PR: achieved all CR criteria except bone marrow blasts decreased by ≥ 50% over pretreatment but still \> 5%, cellularity and morphology not relevant., From first dose up to 43 months|Number of Participants With ECOG Performance Status at Cycle 1(C1) Day2(D2), Number of participants with ECOG PS was reported.

KM Estimate was used., From first dose up to 43 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from the date of first dose until the date of death from any cause (death date - first dose date + 1). For a Participant who was not known to have died by the end of study follow-up, OS was censored at the date of last contact (date of last contact - first dose date + 1).

This study consisted of 2 parts: phase 1 dose escalation and phase 2 dose expansion.

Phase 1 Dose Escalation:

Approximately 18 subjects with either relapsed/refractory (R/R) AML or R/R higher risk MDS were enrolled. Participants received 2 single doses of ASP7517 via intravenous infusion. Dosing occured on day 1 of each cycle. Each cycle was defined as 28 days with a total of 2 treatment cycles.

Participants were managed under hospitalization for at least 7 days during the first cycle of the dose escalation phase. In addition, prior to hospital discharge, participant safety was ensured by performing medical tests and procedures listed on day 7 of cycle 1 and tests considered clinically necessary to evaluate the participant's general condition and adverse event (AE) resolution. The participant was also followed on an outpatient basis on planned visits during cycles 1 and 2 after hospital discharge during the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) assessment period to closely monitor any AEs. Participants were hospitalized days 1 to 7 during cycle 2.

Phase 2 Dose Expansion:

Approximately 104 participants per dose level were enrolled. Each dose level enrolled up to 52 R/R AML participants and up to 52 R/R higher risk MDS participants. Both groups of participants were enrolled in parallel and independently. The number of dose levels investigated during phase 2 were based upon the data from phase 1. When escalation and expansion cohorts were both open for enrollment, enrollment into escalation cohorts took priority such that participants who were eligible for both were preferentially enrolled in the escalation cohorts.
