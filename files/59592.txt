Real-Time kV Imaging vs. Real-Time 3D Patient Surface Tracking for Head & Neck Cancer
To determine if a new optical system that can track a patient's movement during treatment can be used to measure motion and allow for motion adjustments in order to decrease the amount of healthy tissue that receives radiation without limiting our ability to cure cancers using radiation.
Head and Neck Cancer
PROCEDURE: Radiotherapy|PROCEDURE: Align RT
We are measuring how much a patient moves during treatment., This information will be available immediately have the patient is treated.
