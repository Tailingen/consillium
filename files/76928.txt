A Phase Ib/II Dose-finding Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of LDE225 + INC424 in Patients With MF
The purpose of this phase Ib/II clinical trial was to: a) evaluate the safety of the co-administration of LDE225 and INC424 in myelofibrosis patients and establish a maximum tolerated dose and/or Recommended Phase II dose of the combination and b) to assess the efficacy of the co-administration of LDE225 and INC424 on spleen volume reduction.

The first 6 items assess MF symptom severity at its worst as recalled in the 7 days prior to the clinic visit assessment. The symptoms measured include night sweats, itching, abdominal discomfort, pain under the ribs (left side), early satiety, \& bone/muscle pain. The 7th item captures MF-related inactivity in the past 7 days prior to the clinic visit assessment. All 7 items ask subjects to record their answers on an 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS), (0 = Absent, 10 = Worst Imaginable). The first 6 items of the instrument focus on MF symptoms \& are summed to create a Total Symptom score., Week 24, Week 48|Phase Ib and Phase II: Change in Total Symptom Score (TSS) From Baseline to Week 25 & Week 49 Using the MFSAF Total Symptom Scores, The 7-day modified Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form (MFSAF) v2.0 is a 7-item PRO instrument based on the modified MFSAF v2.0 diary administered at specified visits.

The scale includes 5 functional scales (physical functioning, role functioning, emotional functioning, cognitive functioning \& social functioning), global health status/QoL \& 9 symptom scale/items (fatigue, nausea \& vomiting, pain, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, \& financial difficulties). This instrument asks the subject to respond according to the past week, with the exception of the first 5 questions that represent physical functioning \& capture the subject's current status. The range of scores for all of the scales is from 0 to 100. For functional \& global health status/QoL scales, higher scores indicate better QoL \& level of functioning; for symptom scales, higher scores indicate greater level of symptoms or difficulties., Week 24, Week 48|Phase Ib and Phase II: LDE225: PK Parameter: Racc, Racc: Accumulation ratio calculated as AUC0-12h on Week 9 Day 1 divided by AUC0-12h on Week 1 Day 1 \[fold\], 0, 0.5, 1. 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8 hrs on Week 9 Day 1|Phase Ib and Phase II: INC424: PK Parameter: T1/2, T1/2: Elimination half-life associated with the terminal slope (lambda_z) of a semi logarithmic concentration-time curve \[time\], 0, 0.5, 1. 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8 hrs on Week 1 Day 1|Phase Ib and Phase II: INC424: PK Parameter: Vss/F, Vss/F: Apparent volume of distribution at steady state after oral administration \[volume\], 0, 0.5, 1. 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8 hrs on Week 1 Day 1
The study is considered to have been completed because the participants completed the study as per study design at the time of trial termination. If participants were already in extension phase until discontinuation criteria were met or alternative setting was available, they were considered as completed. The study was terminated due to one of the compounds being divested.
