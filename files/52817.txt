Digital Single-operator Cholangioscopy and Intraductal Ultrasound for Nonicteric Biliary Strictures
This study aims to evaluate the usefulness of disposable digital single-operator cholangioscopy (SOC) and intraductal ultrasound (IDUS) for the accurate diagnosis of indeterminate biliary stricture.

Although early and accurate diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma from the biliary stricture is important, accurate differential diagnosis is still difficult even in computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. We planned to evaluate the usefulness of disposable digital single-operator cholangioscopy (SOC) and intraductal ultrasound (IDUS) for the accurate diagnosis of biliary stricture.
