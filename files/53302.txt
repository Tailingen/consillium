A Dose Escalation/Expansion Study of LDK378 in Patients With Tumors Characterized by Genetic Abnormalities in Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase
This study assessed the safety and efficacy of LDK378 in adult patients with genetic abnormalities in anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK).
Tumors Characterized by Genetic Abnormalities of ALK
DRUG: LDK378
Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was defined as the highest dose for a given schedule that was expected to cause DLTs in no more than 33% of patients during the first cycle of treatment. A patient with multiple occurrences of a DLT under one treatment is counted only once in the AE category for that treatment. MTD was determined at 750mg., 33 months
Overall Response Rate (ORR) Based on Investigator Assessment, Overall response rate (ORR) was defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST 1.0. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI. Both CR and PR had to be confirmed by repeat assessments performed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response were first met. CR was the disappearance of all target lesions. PR was at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of the longest diameters. Both CR and PR had to be confirmed by repeat assessments performed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response were first met. CR = at least two determinations of CR, at least 4 weeks apart before progression. PR = at least two determinations of PR or better at least 4 weeks apart before progression (and not qualifying for a CR)., 275 weeks|Overall Response Rate Based on Blinded Independent Review Committee (BIRC) Assessment, Overall response rate (ORR) was defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST 1.0.
