Salvage Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy of the Prostate Bed for Biochemical Recurrence After Radical Prostatectomy.
This is a a randomized phase II/III trial comparing salvage SBRT with standard of care (SOC) regimens for patients with a persistent detectable PSA or biochemical progression during follow-up after radical prostatectomy.

This is a multicentric randomized seamless phase II/III study comparing SBRT to conventional RT or moderately hypofractionated RT on the prostate bed.

All subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio:

1. Experimental arm: Radiotherapy treatment in 5 fractions.
2. Control arm: Radiotherapy treatment within a normofractionated or mildly hypofractionated schedule. For the control arm, each participating center can choose between a normofractionated schedule (32 to 35 treatment sessions) and a moderately hypofractionated schedule (20 sessions).
