Combination Chemotherapy With or Without Anlotinib in the Maintenance Treatment of Non-Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.
This study will compare maintenance therapy with anlotinib plus pemetrexed versus pemetrexed or anlotinib alone, in patients with Non-squamous Non-small cell lung cancer who have not progressed during first-line therapy with anlotinib + pemetrexed + carboplatin. The primary endpoint of the study is progression-free survival (PFS); the secondary endpoints are disease control rate (DCR), objective response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS).
Non-squamous Non-small-cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Anlotinib + Pemetrexed+Carboplatin|DRUG: Pemetrexed|DRUG: Anlotinib + Pemetrexed|DRUG: Anlotinib
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of treatment to the first date of disease progression or death from any cause., 6 months
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Treatment response are defined as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) and progression disease (PD) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECISIT criteria, version 1.1). The percentage of patients who achieved CR and PR was defined as objective response rate (ORR)., each 42 days up to intolerance the toxicity or PD (up to 12 months)|Disease control rate (DCR), Treatment response are defined as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) and progression disease (PD) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECISIT criteria, version 1.1) and the percentage of patients who achieved CR, PR and SD was defined as disease control rate (DCR)., each 42 days up to intolerance the toxicity or PD (up to 12 months)|Overall Survival (OS), OS is calculated from diagnosis to death or last follow-up time., 12 months|Number of Participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, Number of Participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, Until 30 day safety follow-up visit
