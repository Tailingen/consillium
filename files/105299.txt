Multi-center Clinical Study to Evaluate the C2 CryoBalloon Focal Ablation System
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the CryoBalloon Focal Ablation System for the treatment of previously-untreated ("treatment naÃ¯ve") Barrett's Esophagus (BE)

Coldplay III is a multi-center, prospective study that will provide evidence of the efficacy and safety of the System in treatment of patients with previously untreated (treatment naÃ¯ve) low grade dysplasia (LGD) or high grade dysplasia (HGD) BE. Subjects may have a maximum of five (5) ablation treatment sessions during their 12 months of study participation to achieve complete eradication of their dysplastic BE and intestinal metaplasia. As many ablations as needed to treat the dysplastic areas are allowed in each treatment session at the discretion of the investigator.
