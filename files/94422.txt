A Study of DMOT4039A in Participants With Unresectable Pancreatic or Platinum-Resistant Ovarian Cancer
This multicenter, open-label, dose-escalating study will assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of DMOT4039A in participants with unresectable pancreatic or platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. Cohorts of participants will receive multiple ascending intravenous doses of DMOT4039A.
