Measured in Complete Response and Partial Response, Nivo Mono: approximately up to 6 years and 9 months Nivo Ipi: approximately up to 5 months Nivo Liri: approximately up to 4 years 1 month|Progression Free Survival, Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the time between date of randomization and date of progression or death, whichever occurs first. Participants who died without a reported prior progression were considered to have progressed on the date of their death. Subjects who did not progress or die were censored on the date of their last efficacy assessment., From date of randomization to date of progression or death, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 24 months)|Progression Free Survival Rate, The percentage of participants remaining progression free at the specified timepoints (up to 48 Months), From randomization to the specified timepoints (up to 48 months)|Overall Survival, The percentage of participants remaining alive. Median values are computed using Kaplan-Meier method, Nivo Mono: approximately up to 6 years and 9 months Nivo Ipi: approximately up to3 years Nivo Liri: approximately up to 4 years 1 month|Number of Participants With PD-L1 Expression, Number of Participants with PD-L1 expression in the following categories

* baseline PD-L1 expression â‰¥ 1%
* baseline PD-L1 expression \< 1%
* without PD-L1 quantifiable at baseline, At baseline (prior to start of study treatment)|Percentage Change From Baseline in the Modified Severity Weighted Assessment Tool (mSWAT) Score, mSWAT is a scoring technique involving the direct assessment of the percentage of body-surface-area (BSA) affected by skin lesions.

There are 12 body regions (each one assigned a different percentage of BSA). For each body region, the assigned BSA percentage is multiplied by a factor weighing the type and severity of lesion observed (patch= x1, plaque = x2, tumor= x4).

The sum of the individual body region sub-scores is then summed to generate the final mSWAT score, which ranges from 0 (best outcome) to 400 (worst outcome)., From baseline (last measurement before start of study treatment) to last available measurement after start of study treatment (88 weeks for Nivo mono, 93 weeks for nivo+ipi, 25 weeks for nivo+liri)|Time to MRD Negativity Status in the Nivolumab + Daratumumab Cohort, Time to MRD Negativity status in specific NGS and NGF sensitivity levels, approximately up to 4 years|Objective Response Rate in the Nivolumab + Daratumumab Cohort, approximately up to 4 years|Duration of Response in the Nivolumab + Daratumumab Cohort, approximately up to 4 years|Progression Free Survival in the Nivolumab + Daratumumab Cohort, approximately up to 4 years|Cmax in the Nivolumab + Daratumumab Cohort, Maximum observed serum concentration, approximately up to 4 years|Tmax in the Nivolumab + Daratumumab Cohort, Time of maximum observed serum concentration, approximately up to 4 years|Cmin in the Nivolumab + Daratumumab Cohort, Serum concentration achieved at the end of dosing interval (trough concentration), approximately up to 4 years|AUC (0-T) in the Nivolumab + Daratumumab Cohort, Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to the last time of the last quantifiable concentration, approximately up to 4 years|AUC (TAU) in the Nivolumab + Daratumumab Cohort, Area under the concentration-time curve in one dosing interval, approximately up to 4 years|End of Infusion Nivolumab Concentration Levels in the Nivolumab + Daratumumab Cohort, Serum concentration achieved at the end of study drug infusion, Measurements collected at cycles 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11; each cycle is 28 days
