Comparison of Two Endoscopic Biopsic Needles for Pancreatic Tumors
This observational study compared quality of histological sampling of pancreatic EUS-FNB with the 20-gauge Procore® and 22-gauge Acquire® needles. In total, 68 patients were recruited. Histological diagnosis was achieved and a histological core biopsy was obtained in 82% of patients (28/34) in the 20-gauge Procore® group and 97% of patients (33/34) in the 22-gauge Acquire® group (P=0.1). Core biopsy specimens obtained were significantly longer with the 22-gauge Acquire® needle with a mean cumulative length of tissue core biopsies per needle pass of 4,33±3,46mm vs. 7,9±4,35mm for the 20-gauge Procore® (P\<0,01). Reproducibility of this simple histological criterion was validated in intra and inter-observer.

Between March and December 2017, 68 EUS-FNB were consecutively performed in our unit for a pancreatic or peripancreatic mass. The choice of the needle depended upon the availability at the time of admission: 34 punctures were performed with a 20-gauge Procore®, and 34 with a 22-gauge Acquire®. Histological material was studied in a blinded manner with respect to the needle, and cumulative length of tissue core biopsies per needle pass was determined. Intra and inter-observer variability of this criterion was then evaluated.
