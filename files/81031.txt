Phase II Trial Comparing ABI-007 (Abraxane®, Nab®-Paclitaxel) to Taxotere in First Line Therapy of Patients With Stage IV Breast Cancer
This was an open-label study conducted comparing the toxicity and antitumor activity of ABI-007 (Abraxane®, nab®-paclitaxel) to docetaxel (Taxotere).
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: ABI-007|DRUG: Docetaxel
Percentage of Participants Showing an Overall Response As Assessed by the Independent Radiology Reader and by the Investigator, Percentage of participants who achieve an objective confirmed complete or partial overall response based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0. A complete response (CR) is the disappearance of all known disease and no new sites or disease related symptoms. A partial response (PR) is \>= 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesion. PR was also recorded when all measurable disease has completely disappeared, but a non-measurable component (ie, ascites) is still present but not progressing. Overall response (ORR) = CR+PR., Day 1 up to 95 weeks
Percentage of Participants With Stable Disease for ≥ 16 Weeks, or Complete or Partial Overall Response, Known as the disease control rate, this outcome measures the percentage of participants with stable disease for 16 weeks or more, or had a confirmed complete or partial response (see outcome #1 for confirmed response definitions). Assessments made by independent radiology and by investigators are reported separately, Day 1 up to 95 weeks|Kaplan-Meier Estimates for Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the start of disease progression (PD) or patient death (any cause), whichever occurred first. Patients without disease progression were censored at the last time the patient was known to be progression-free. Patients who initiated new anticancer therapy prior to documented progression or death were censored at the start of new therapy. Disease progression was assessed separately by investigators and by an independent radiologist. Both assessments are offered. Response was evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0 (Therasse, 2000). PD for target lesions is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of the longest diameters recorded since the treatment started; or the appearance of one or more new lesions; or the unequivocal progression of a non-target lesion., Day 1 up to 95 weeks|Kaplan-Meier Estimates for Duration of Response Based on Independent Radiology Assessment of Response and Progression, Duration of response was measured as the progression-free survival on patients with confirmed response. The independent radiology assessment is offered here. Response was evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0 (Therasse, 2000) and is defined in outcome #1. Progression-free survival is defined in outcome #3., Day 1 - 95 weeks|Kaplan-Meier Estimates for Duration of Response Based on Investigator Assessment of Response and Progression, Duration of response was measured as the progression-free survival on patients with confirmed response. The investigator assessment is offered here. Response was evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0 (Therasse, 2000) and is defined in outcome #1. Progression-free survival is defined in outcome #3., Day 1 - 95 weeks|Kaplan-Meier Estimate for Overall Survival (OS), Participant survival was defined as the date of randomization to the date of death. Participants that were alive at the time of analysis were censored at the last known time that the participant was alive. The final analysis of mature overall survival was conducted after 2 years of follow-up (data cutoff date 31 Jan 2010)., Day 1 to 221 weeks|Participants With Treatment-Emergent, Treatment-Related Adverse Events, Summary of participants who had treatment-emergent that were treatment-related in the opinion of the investigator, and summarized in a variety of categories. The National Cancer Institute (NCI)'s Common Terminology Criteria for AEs (CTCAE) was used to grade AE severity: severity grade 3= severe and undesirable AE. Severity grade 4= life-threatening or disabling AE. Severity grade 5 = death., Day 1 up to 125 weeks
Nadir of Myelosuppression (Over All Cycles) as Measured by Absolute Neutrophils (ANC), White Blood Cells (WBC) and Platelet Counts, Maximal degree of myelosuppression is represented by the nadir in absolute neutrophil (ANC), white blood cell (WBC), and platelet measurements over all treatment cycles., Day 1 up to 125 weeks|Nadir of Myelosuppression (Over All Cycles) as Measured by Hemoglobin (Hb) Counts, Maximal degree of myelosuppression is represented by the nadir in hemoglobin (Hb) measurements over all treatment cycles., Day 1 up to 125 weeks
This was an open-label, randomized study to compare the following regimens with respect to toxicity and antitumor activity:

* the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ABI-007 300 mg/m\^2 every 3 weeks;
* ABI-007 100 mg/m\^2 administered weekly for 3 weeks with a 1 week rest;
* ABI-007 150 mg/m\^2 administered weekly for 3 weeks with a 1 week rest;
* the standard dose and schedule of Taxotere (100 mg/m\^2 every 3 weeks).
