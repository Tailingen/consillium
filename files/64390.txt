Safety of Intraperitoneal (IP) OXAliplatin (OXA) in Association With Systemic FOLFIRI Bevacizumab Chemotherapy in Patients With Peritoneal Carcinosis
Peritoneal carcinosis (PC) corresponds to a locoregional extension into the peritoneum of rare primary peritoneal cancers, or more frequently distant extension of digestive cancers (colorectal or gastric) or gynecological (ovarian, fallopian tube, or endometrial). PC can be considered as a distinct oncological entity as its genesis, natural history, and response to systematic treatments differ to those of other metastases. The development of PC, observed in 25-35% of colorectal cancers, is generally considered as a unfavorable event in the course of the disease. The prognosis is defined by the possibility of complete resection, possibly after neoadjuvant treatment. The benefit provided by the combination of cytoreductive surgery and heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) with respect to systemic chemotherapy in patients with PC of colorectal origin has been demonstrated based on overall survival in several randomized trials, among which one evaluated oxaliplatin. The evaluation of the clinical benefit-risk related to the repeated administration of non-hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy, as has been validated in ovarian cancer, in patients with PC of colorectal origin is already being investigated by several international teams.

The FOLFOXIRI + bevacizumab every 2 weeks is a modern therapeutic option in patients with this disease. The intraperitoneal rather than intravenous (IV) administration of oxaliplatin, in this combination, could increase the response of peritoneal lesions known to be relatively insensitive to IV chemotherapy.
