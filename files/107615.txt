PROWESS (PROstate Cancer Wearables Exercise and Structured Supports): a Pilot Supportive Care Intervention
The goal of this research study is to conduct an open pilot of a behavioral change intervention called PROstate Cancer Wearables, Exercise, and Structured Supports (PROWESS) for integrating health behavior change tools and to increase exercise, reduce side effects of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), and improve quality of life in Black and Hispanic/Latino men with prostate cancer.

The name of the intervention used in this research study is:

PROWESS (behavioral change intervention)
Prostate Cancer|Prostatic Neoplasms
BEHAVIORAL: PROWESS
Participant Satisfaction, Assessed by the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-3 (CSQ), a 3-item survey with answers ranging from 1-4, "quite dissatisfied" to "very satisfied.", At week 8-12 (intervention completion)
Change in Objective Physical Activity, Collected physical activity via FitBit measure of steps and activity classification., At Baseline and from weeks 1 - 12|Change in Self-Reported Exercise, Assessed by the Short-Form International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), a self-reported measure of physical activity., At Baseline and weeks 8-12|Change in Participant Quality of Life, Assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P), which consists of five subscales assessing physical, functional, emotional, social wellbeing., At Baseline and weeks 8-12|Change in Psychological Distress Symptoms, Assessed by the Patient Health Questinnaire-4, a 4-item measure with two separate subscales to evaluate symptoms of anxiety and depression., At Baseline and weeks 8-12|Change in Self-Efficacy for Managing Symptoms, Assessed by the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Self-Efficacy for Managing Chronic Conditions - Managing Symptoms Scale, an 8-item measure to evaluate self-efficacy., At Baseline and weeks 8-12
This research study is to test a behavioral change intervention called PROstate Cancer Wearables, Exercise, and Structured Supports (PROWESS) for integrating health behavior change tools with wearable technology, to increase exercise, reduce side effects of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), and improve quality of life in Black and Hispanic/Latino men with prostate cancer on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).

Study procedures include screening for eligibility, intervention sessions, questionnaires and surveys, and an exit interview with study staff.

Participation in this research study is expected to last for up to four months.

The goal and primary outcome of this open pilot study is refinement of the intervention and study procedures to allow for us to conduct a larger feasibility study in the future.

It is expected that about 10 people will take part in this research study.

This research study is being supported by the MGH Cancer Center
