A Study of NBF-006 in Non-Small Cell Lung, Pancreatic, or Colorectal Cancer
This is an open-label, non-controlled study conducted in two parts - Part A (dose escalation) followed by Part B (dose expansion).
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer|Pancreatic Cancer|Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: NBF-006
Number of patients with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, Change in the incidence and severity of adverse events related to study treatment from baseline to 4 weeks following last dose
Best Overall Response per RECIST 1.1, The rate of complete remission (CR) + partial remission (PR) + stable disease (SD), Number of days from date of first dose to 30 days after last treatment|Pharmacokinetic parameters for siRNA, Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Up to 72 hours from start of infusion on Cycle 1, Day 1 and Day 22 and prior to infusion Cycle 1, Day 8 and Cycle 2, Day 1|Additional pharmacokinetic parameters for siRNA, Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), Up to 72 hours from start of infusion on Cycle 1, Day 1 and Day 22 and prior to infusion Cycle 1, Day 8 and Cycle 2, Day 1
To evaluate correlation between biomarkers and clinical outcome, analysis of ADAs, immune activation biomarkers, GSTP knockdown, and other biomarker activity, Number of days from date of first dose to 30 days after last treatment|To evaluate correlation between KRAS mutations and clinical outcome, Number of days from date of first dose to 30 days after last treatment
Patients in Part A will have previously treated progressive or metastatic NSCLC, pancreatic, or colorectal cancer, with or without KRAS mutation. Five dose levels will be explored. In dose level 5, only patients with previously-treated NSCLC with KRAS mutation will be included.

Patients in Part B must have previously treated NSCLC with confirmed KRAS mutation. Two dose levels will be explored further in Part B. Twenty (20) patients will be enrolled in Part B, with 10 patients enrolled in each of the two cohorts. Once dose level 5 has been confirmed to be safe in Part A (i.e. 0-1 DLT in 6 patients), an additional 4 patients will then be enrolled for a planned total of 24 patients in Part B.
