Evaluation of UCPVax Plus Nivolumab as Second Line Therapy in Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
Lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy and the leading cause of cancer-related mortality both in men and women worldwide.

The past few years have demonstrated great progress in the field of tumor immunotherapy through agents that address mechanisms of immune escape notably, so called immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICB). Indeed, ICB have emerged as a fatal weapon in the anticancer treatment arsenal. Anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies have shown promising results in several cancers including Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) patients. Although such ICB extend patient's survival compared with conventional systemic therapies, they fail to control cancer progression in a significant proportion of patients which can reach up to 50-60% in NSCLC. Recent literature highlights a range of factors involved in the heterogeneous responses and failures to ICB therapies. The challenge is how can ICB treatment efficacy be extended to majority patients? To respond to this question, to increase the success of immunotherapy, immuno-oncology community develops combinations approaches.

The aim of these project is to evaluate the efficacy of Nivolumab plus a novel CD4Th1 inducer anti-cancer vaccine in NSCLC patients.

Nivolumab (NIVO), which is an anti-PD-1 antibody, has shown promising results in 2nd line treatment for advanced NSCLC.

UCPVax is a therapeutic anti-cancer vaccine based on the telomerase-derived helper peptides designed to induce strong TH1 CD4 T cell responses in cancer patients (NCT02818426).
Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: UCPVax + Nivolumab|DRUG: standard chemotherapy
6 months Progression-Free Survival (PFS) rate, PFS is defined by the duration from the date of initiation of the treatment to the disease progression (RECIST) or death from any cause whichever occurs first, censoring cases without progression at the date of last disease assessment., 6 months after the date of initiation of treatment (1st day of 1st cycle of chemotherapy)
