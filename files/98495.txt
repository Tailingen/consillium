Efficacy and Safety of JMT101 Combined With Osimertinib in Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This study is a phase II, open label, multi-center study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of JMT101 combined with Osimertinib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations.
