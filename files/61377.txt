Objective response rate, The proportion of patients whose tumor volume shrinks to a predetermined value and can maintain the minimum required duration, including complete response and partial response., Baseline up to approximately 6 months
Disease control rate, It refers to the proportion of patients whose tumor volume control (shrinkage or enlargement) reaches a predetermined value and can maintain the minimum required duration. According to the RECIST criteria (version 1.1), during the treatment period or within 30 days after the discontinuation of the investigational drug, it is the sum of the percentage of subjects who achieve complete response (CR), partial response (PR), and stable disease (SD)., Baseline up to approximately 6 months|Progression-free survival, It refers to the time from the first administration of the regimen to the first occurrence of disease progression or death due to any cause in the subjects., Baseline up to approximately 12 months|Overall survival, The time from randomization to death due to any cause in the subjects., Baseline up to approximately 12 months|Duration of response, It refers to the time from the first report of objective tumor partial or complete response (based on the earlier occurrence) to the first occurrence of disease progression or death in the subjects., Baseline up to approximately 12 months|Clinical benefit rate, The ratio of subjects who achieve complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) or maintain stable disease (SD) ., Baseline up to approximately 12 months|progression-free survival rate, The percentage of patients who have not experienced disease progression or death due to any cause after receiving the therapy, among the evaluable patients for efficacy., Baseline up to approximately 12 months|overall survival rate, The percentage of patients who died due to any cause after receiving therapy among all enrolled patients., Baseline up to approximately 12 months
This trial is a two-arm, randomized, multi-center phase II clinical study. Eligible subjects who meet the study criteria will be screened and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive treatment with intravenous infusion of Durvalumab combined with oral lenvatinib, with or without chemotherapy. The investigators will closely follow up and assess the efficacy and safety of the combined treatment, evaluate the progression-free survival of the subjects until progression occurs, and observe their overall survival as a secondary outcome.
