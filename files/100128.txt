Ultrasound Guided Percutaneous Microwave Ablation for Breast Lesions
The investigators will perform this study to prospectively analyse the clinical outcome after percutaneous microwave ablation(MWA) of benign and malignant breast lesion under ultrasound (US) guidance.
Neoplasm of Breast
DEVICE: microwave ablation
reduction in volume, the volume reduction ratio (VRR) which was calculated by the following equation: VRR (%) = \[(initial volume - final volume) × 100\]/initial volume., 5 year
A total of more than 500 patients diagnosed with benign breast lesions and 50 patients with malignant breast lesions in seven centers of China will be recruited in this study and underwent US-guided percutaneous MWA treatment. Information for each patient includes demographics; longest diameters of tumors; tumor numbers; tumor pathological type; location of tumor according to whether adjacent to skin, pectoralis, areola and papilla. Ablation variables including session, puncture, time, and power; complete ablation, complications; reduction in volume, palpability, pain and cosmetic satisfying outcomes,recurrence,survival will be measured and analyzed.
