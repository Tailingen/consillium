Single Arm Trial of Preoperative Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) for T3a or Gleason Grade Group 4 Prostate Cancer
This study involves Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) followed by prostatectomy (removal of the prostate). SBRT is a relatively new radiation technique in which a few doses of radiation are delivered to small, well-defined tumors. It has been used effectively in other cancers like lung and liver. The radiation will be given for only 5 days.

The purpose of this study is to compare the effects, good and/or bad, of different doses of SBRT given before prostatectomy.
Prostate Cancer
DEVICE: Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT)
Measure of PSA (Prostate Specific Antigen), Measure of PSA through treatment. PSA is expected to be undetectable (\<0.2 mg/ml) after prostatectomy and radiation therapy., Up to 12 months|Number of symptomatic adverse anastomotic events, Number of symptomatic anastomotic events related to pre-operative SBRT., Up to 12 months
Mean Catheterization Time, Average time of catheterization following prostatectomy, Up to 4 weeks post surgery|Mean Hospital Stay, Average time of hospitalization after prostatectomy, Up to 2 week post surgery|Quality of Life assessment, Quality of Life will be assessed using 2 questionnaires: International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM). The IPSS is an eight question questionnaire of symptoms ranging from 0 "not at all" to 5 "always". The SHIM is a five question questionnaire ranging from 1 "almost never or never" to 5 "almost always or always" to determine erectile dysfunction., Baseline, at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 2 months and every 3 months up to 12 months post surgery
