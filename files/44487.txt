Oral ONC201 in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of Oral ONC201 in treating patients with advanced solid tumors. Oral ONC201 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
Solid Tumors
DRUG: Oral ONC201
Dose limiting toxicity rate during cycle 1 of treatment with oral ONC201, Day 21
Recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for oral ONC201, At the end of 6 weeks therapy|Frequency of toxicities associated with ONC201, Up to 4 weeks after end of study treatment|Pharmacokinetics of oral ONC201 - Half-life, Up to 4 weeks of therapy|Pharmacokinetics of oral ONC201 - Maximum concentration, Up to 4 weeks of therapy|Pharmacokinetics of oral ONC201 - Area under the curve (AUC) over time, Up to 4 weeks of therapy|Response rate of oral ONC201 in patients with advanced solid tumors, 3 months
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the recommended phase II dose of single agent ONC201 orally once every three weeks.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To characterize pharmacokinetics of ONC201. II. To assess serum biomarkers of therapeutic response to ONC201. III. To assess preliminary antitumor activity of ONC201 as a single agent in advanced solid tumors.

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

Patients receive ONC201 orally (PO) on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days for a total of 2 courses.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.
