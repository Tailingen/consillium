A Prospective Randomized Controlled Study of Radiotherapy and the Concurrent Three-week and Single-week TP Chemotherapy for Advanced Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma and the Correlation Between HPV Classification and Sensitivity.
the main purpose for this experiments are as follows: 1. Patients with stage ⅡB-ⅢB cervical squamous cell carcinoma who received full dose radiotherapy will be randomly assigned to the combined TP regimen weekly treatment group and 3-week treatment group for the short-term efficacy and safety observation; 2. All enrolled patients will be tested for HPV subtype infection; the relationship between the sensitivity and curative effect of concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy will be analyzed, and at the end of the test, HPV subtypes will be tested again and changes will be analyzed to provide more clinical evidence for the reasonable comprehensive treatment and precision medical treatment of advanced cervical squamous cell carcinoma.
