A Phase 1 Study Evaluating CB-5083 in Subjects With Lymphoid Hematological Malignancies
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, dose limiting toxicities, and maximum tolerated dose of CB-5083 in subjects with lymphoid hematological malignancies.
Lymphoid Hematological Malignancies|Relapsed and Refractory Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: CB-5083|DRUG: Dexamethasone
To determine the dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) of oral CB-5083 in subjects with lymphoid hematological malignancies, Dose Escalation Stage - the first 28 days of treatment (Cycle 1) with CB-5083|To determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of oral CB-5083 in subjects with lymphoid hematological malignancies by measuring the AUC, Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion Stages - days 1, 2, 4 and 5 of Cycle 1 and days 1 and 2 in the second 28 days (Cycle 2) of treatment with CB-5083|To determine the PK profile of oral CB-5083 in subjects with lymphoid hematological malignancies by measuring the Cmax, Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion Stages - days 1, 2, 4 and 5 of Cycle 1 and days 1 and 2 of Cycle 2 of treatment with CB-5083|To determine the PK profile of oral CB-5083 in subjects with lymphoid hematological malignancies by measuring the Cmin, Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion Stages - days 1, 2, 4 and 5 of Cycle 1 and days 1 and 2 of Cycle 2 of treatment with CB-5083|To determine the PK profile of oral CB-5083 in subjects with lymphoid hematological malignancies by measuring the Tmax, Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion Stages - days 1, 2, 4 and 5 of Cycle 1 and days 1 and 2 of Cycle 2 of treatment with CB-5083|To determine the PK profile of oral CB-5083 in subjects with lymphoid hematological malignancies by measuring the T1/2, Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion Stages - days 1, 2, 4 and 5 of Cycle 1 and days 1 and 2 of Cycle 2 of treatment with CB-5083|To confirm the safety and tolerability of oral CB-5083 administered to subjects with relapsed and refractory Multiple Myeloma at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) at the end of the Dose Escalation Stage, Dose Expansion Stage - from day 1 of Cycle 1 through 28 days after the patient's last cycle of treatment|To confirm the safety and tolerability of oral CB-5083 administered to subjects with relapsed/refractory DLBCL or Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia at the MTD, Dose Expansion Stage - from day 1 of Cycle 1 through 28 days after the patient's last cycle of treatment
To assess the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of CB-5083 in peripheral blood cells and cancer cells, Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion Stages - days 1, 2, 4 and 5 of Cycle 1|To further asses the PK profile of oral CB-5083 in subjects by measuring the AUC, Dose Expansion Stages - days 1, 2, 4 and 5 of Cycle 1 and days 1 and 2 of Cycle 2 of treatment with CB-5083|To further asses the PK profile of oral CB-5083 in subjects by measuring the Cmax, Dose Expansion Stages - days 1, 2, 4 and 5 of Cycle 1 and days 1 and 2 of Cycle 2 of treatment with CB-5083|To further asses the PK profile of oral CB-5083 in subjects by measuring the Cmin, Dose Expansion Stages - days 1, 2, 4 and 5 of Cycle 1 and days 1 and 2 of Cycle 2 of treatment with CB-5083|To further asses the PK profile of oral CB-5083 in subjects by measuring the Tmax, Dose Expansion Stages - days 1, 2, 4 and 5 of Cycle 1 and days 1 and 2 of Cycle 2 of treatment with CB-5083|To further asses the PK profile of oral CB-5083 in subjects by measuring the T1/2, Dose Expansion Stages - days 1, 2, 4 and 5 of Cycle 1 and days 1 and 2 of Cycle 2 of treatment with CB-5083|To evaluate preliminary efficacy of oral CB-5083 in subjects, using standard response criteria, Dose Expansion Stages - at the end of each 28 day cycle of treatment
To assess the predictive value of potential baseline biomarkers for clinical trial subject enrichment strategies, Dose Expansion Stages - within 28 days before day 1 of Cycle 1
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, dose limiting toxicities, and maximum tolerated dose of CB-5083 in subjects with lymphoid hematological malignancies.
