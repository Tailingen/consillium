Animal-Assisted Interactions in Children With Life-Threatening Conditions and Their Parents
This study will evaluate the effects of animal-assisted interactions (AAI) on stress, anxiety, and quality of life in children with a life-threatening condition and their parents. It is anticipated to be a milestone in understanding the human-animal bond.

BEHAVIORAL: Animal-Assisted Interactions
Pediatric Quality of Life, The Peds Quality of Life measure will be administered to children and their parents (proxy) once a month, up to 3 months|Anxiety, The state-trait anxiety inventory will be administered to children and their parents after each intervention or usual care visit, up to 3 months|Stress, Saliva samples to measure cortisol levels will be administered to children after animal-assisted interventions or after completion of measures in usual care group, up to 3 months
Objectives:

1. Examine the feasibility of animal-assisted interactions sessions for children with a life-threatening condition and primary caregiver to:

   * Identify and document modifications for a safe and feasible intervention,
   * Obtain recruitment estimates and determine potential recruitment barriers
   * Evaluate elements of implementation fidelity (design, training, delivery/receipt of Treatment, enactment)
   * Verify safety.

   H1-1: Children and parents (\>60%) will complete the interventions and provide positive acceptability data. H1-2: Implementation fidelity can be achieved with the proposed methodology
2. Determine the preliminary efficacy of animal-assisted interactions sessions for:

   * Children with a life-threatening condition (LTC) for the outcome of health-related quality of life
   * Children with a LTC and their primary caregivers for the outcomes of stress and anxiety

H2-1 Children with a life-threatening condition who receive animal-assisted interactions will experience improved health-related quality of life (HRQOL) more than patients who do not receive animal-assisted interactions.

H2-2a Children with life-threatening condition who receive animal-assisted interactions will experience decreased stress and anxiety more than parents of children who do not receive animal-assisted interactions.

H2-2b Primary caregivers of children with a life-threatening condition who receive animal-assisted interactions will experience decreased stress and anxiety more than parents of children who do not receive animal-assisted interactions.
