Efficacy and Resistance Mechanisms of IP in NSCLC With Leptomeningeal Metastases
This is a prospective interventional study clinical study to investigate the efficacy and resistance mechanisms of intrathecal pemetrexed in patients with driver gene mutations advanced NSCLC with leptomeningeal metastases.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Intrathecal pemetrexed
Intracranial progression-free survival (I-PFS), Intracranial progression-free survival was defined as the duration from the start of IP to the worsening of neurological symptoms, radiological confirmation of brain progression, or patient death, Time from first subject dose to study completion, or up to 36 month
System progression-free survival (s-PFS), System progression-free survival was defined as the duration from the start of IP to the worsening of neurological symptoms, radiological confirmation of brain progression, or patient death, Time from first subject dose to study completion, or up to 36 month
Overall Survival Time, Overall Survival Time was defined as the duration from the start of IP to patient death, Time from first subject dose to study completion, or up to 36 month
This is a prospective interventional clinical study aimed at investigating the efficacy and resistance mechanisms of intrathecal pemetrexed in advanced NSCLC patients with EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 mutations presenting leptomeningeal metastases. Approximately 30 advanced NSCLC patients with EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 mutations, who have developed leptomeningeal metastases following TKI resistance, will receive intrathecal pemetrexed. Cerebrospinal fluid samples will be collected before and after pemetrexed resistance to analyze molecular mechanisms and differences. Second-generation gene detection will be performed to identify potential resistance mechanisms to pemetrexed. The study is expected to commence recruitment in mainland China around April 2024, with an anticipated completion date in April 2025.
