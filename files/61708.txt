Verbal and Written Instruction Versus Verbal and Written Plus Simulation in Patients With Breast Cancer and Their Caregivers
The purpose of this study is to compare two different ways of teaching people how to give injections at home. The first is what we do now, which is teaching patients and/or their caregivers verbally and by giving written instructions. The second is what we do now (verbal and written instructions) along with a demonstration and practice using a needle and an injection pad that feels similar to skin and fat. This is being done to find the best method for teaching people to give an injection at home.

compare verbal and written teaching for injection teaching, with verbal and written teaching + simulation using an injection model, in terms of:

* Patient/caregiver satisfaction
* Patient/caregiver self-confidence
* Nurse satisfaction, 1 year
Assess for changes in patient self-reported, worry about injection before and after the injection teaching, 1 year|Compare nurses' perceptions of patient/caregiver confidence levels, after injection teaching to actual patient/caregiver reported confidence levels, 1 year|Compare the amount of nurses' time spent teaching, between the teaching modalities, 1 year
