Isatuximab in Adult Patients With Cytologic or Molecular Relapsed/Refractory CD38 Positive T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
The planned trial offers treatment cohorts for patients with full cytologic relapse (R/R ALL - Cohort 1), as well as for patients with molecular failure/relapse (MRD+ ALL - Cohort 2). Basically, the study aims to develop data for optimization of first-line therapy of T-ALL, either by modification of standard induction with Isatuximab or by establishing a post-induction therapy for eradication of MRD and thereby evaluates in parallel two different strategies.
