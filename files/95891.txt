Evaluating the Effectiveness of Art Therapy on Mood, Anxiety, and Pain Levels in Cancer Patients
Participants in this research study are asked to tell about their experience with art therapy. Participants in this research study are currently receiving chemotherapy treatment for cancer. The purpose of this study is to learn how art therapy affects mood, anxiety, pain, and emotions of individuals with cancer who are undergoing chemotherapy.

The effect of art therapy on the cancer patient's mood, The primary endpoint of the trial is to access the effect of an art therapy session on the patients' mood, anxiety level, and pain. To accomplish this, patients will complete four visual analog scales (VAS) prior to and after the session. The primary end points are the pre-and post session changes in the VAS., Change from baseline to after intervention, about 50 minutes|The effect of art therapy on the cancer patient's anxiety, The primary endpoint of the trial is to access the effect of an art therapy session on the patients' mood, anxiety level, and pain. To accomplish this, patients will complete four visual analog scales (VAS) prior to and after the session. The primary end points are the pre-and post session changes in the VAS., Change from baseline to after intervention, about 50 minutes|The effect of art therapy on the cancer patient's pain, The primary endpoint of the trial is to access the effect of an art therapy session on the patients' mood, anxiety level, and pain. To accomplish this, patients will complete four visual analog scales (VAS) prior to and after the session. The primary end points are the pre-and post session changes in the VAS., Change from baseline to after intervention, about 50 minutes
exploratory assessment of the association between sum of pain, anxiety, and mood visual analog scale (VAS) scores and ethnic group of patients, The secondary goal is to assess, in an exploratory manner, associations between VAS scores (baseline and changes) and patient characteristics as well as patients' expressed primary concerns. Data will be analyzed using methods such as 2-sample and paired t-tests, ANOVA, and Pearson correlations., Change from baseline to after intervention, about 50 minutes|exploratory assessment of the association between sum of pain, anxiety, and mood visual analog scale (VAS) scores and race of patients, The secondary goal is to assess, in an exploratory manner, associations between VAS scores (baseline and changes) and patient characteristics as well as patients' expressed primary concerns. Data will be analyzed using methods such as 2-sample and paired t-tests, ANOVA, and Pearson correlations., Change from baseline to after intervention, about 50 minutes|exploratory assessment of the association between sum of pain, anxiety, and mood visual analog scale (VAS) scores and age of patients, The secondary goal is to assess, in an exploratory manner, associations between VAS scores (baseline and changes) and patient characteristics as well as patients' expressed primary concerns. Data will be analyzed using methods such as 2-sample and paired t-tests, ANOVA, and Pearson correlations., Change from baseline to after intervention, about 50 minutes|exploratory assessment of the association between sum of pain, anxiety, and mood visual analog scale (VAS) scores and sex of patients, The secondary goal is to assess, in an exploratory manner, associations between VAS scores (baseline and changes) and patient characteristics as well as patients' expressed primary concerns. Data will be analyzed using methods such as 2-sample and paired t-tests, ANOVA, and Pearson correlations., Change from baseline to after intervention, about 50 minutes|exploratory assessment of the association between sum of pain, anxiety, and mood visual analog scale (VAS) scores and caregiver support of patients, The secondary goal is to assess, in an exploratory manner, associations between VAS scores (baseline and changes) and patient characteristics as well as patients' expressed primary concerns. Data will be analyzed using methods such as 2-sample and paired t-tests, ANOVA, and Pearson correlations., Change from baseline to after intervention, about 50 minutes|exploratory assessment of the association between sum of pain, anxiety, and mood visual analog scale (VAS) scores and cancer diagnosis of patients, The secondary goal is to assess, in an exploratory manner, associations between VAS scores (baseline and changes) and patient characteristics as well as patients' expressed primary concerns. Data will be analyzed using methods such as 2-sample and paired t-tests, ANOVA, and Pearson correlations., Change from baseline to after intervention, about 50 minutes|exploratory assessment of the association between sum of pain, anxiety, and mood visual analog scale (VAS) scores and reason for visit of patients, The secondary goal is to assess, in an exploratory manner, associations between VAS scores (baseline and changes) and patient characteristics as well as patients' expressed primary concerns. Data will be analyzed using methods such as 2-sample and paired t-tests, ANOVA, and Pearson correlations., Change from baseline to after intervention, about 50 minutes|exploratory assessment of the association between sum of pain, anxiety, and mood visual analog scale (VAS) scores and marital status of patients, The secondary goal is to assess, in an exploratory manner, associations between VAS scores (baseline and changes) and patient characteristics as well as patients' expressed primary concerns. Data will be analyzed using methods such as 2-sample and paired t-tests, ANOVA, and Pearson correlations., Change from baseline to after intervention, about 50 minutes|exploratory assessment of the association between sum of pain, anxiety, and mood visual analog scale (VAS) scores and primary concern expressed by patients during art therapy session, The secondary goal is to assess, in an exploratory manner, associations between VAS scores (baseline and changes) and patient characteristics as well as patients' expressed primary concerns. Data will be analyzed using methods such as 2-sample and paired t-tests, ANOVA, and Pearson correlations., Change from baseline to after intervention, about 50 minutes
In this single-center single-arm non-controlled descriptive study, we aim to describe the effects of a single art therapy session on a cancer patient's mood, pain, anxiety level.

Primary Objectives

* To assess the effect of art therapy on the cancer patient's mood
* To assess the effect of art therapy on the cancer patient's anxiety
* To assess the effect of art therapy on the cancer patient's pain

Secondary Objectives

* To explore differences in response to art therapy by ethnic group, race, age, sex, caregiver support, cancer diagnosis, reason for visit, and marital status
* To explore differences in response to art therapy by primary concern expressed by patients during art therapy sessions
