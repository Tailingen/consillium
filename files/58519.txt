Assessment of VMCore Biopsy Versus Standard of Care Biopsy
Prostate biopsy is the definitive test to establish the diagnosis of prostate cancer. The standard of care biopsy needles do not predictably obtain full cores of tissue and what tissue obtained is often fragmented, making pathologic review a challenge. The VMCore Biopsy System has a geometry in the tip of its biopsy needles that capture more tissue in a single sample. This study is to compare the characteristics of tissue captured by either standard of care needles and the VMCore needle.
Prostate Cancer
DEVICE: VMCore Biopsy System|DEVICE: Standard of Care Biopsy Needle
Procedure Success, Percentage of tissue samples suitable for pathological review, 1 Day of the procedure|Adverse Events, Incidence and Severity of Adverse events associated with use of the biopsy needles, 1 Day of the procedure|Patient Pain During use of the biopsy needles, Pain measured with Likert Scale of 1 to 5, 1 Day of the procedure
Mean Tissue volume for each sample taken, Length and diameter of tissue samples for cubic centimeters of volume, 1 Day of the procedure
This post-market study is being conducted in order to assess the capability of the VMCore biopsy needle to capture prostate tissue in subjects consenting to the use of both the VMCore needle and the urological practice's standard of care needle for twinned samples during a routine prostate biopsy procedure. The primary endpoints are to success in tissue core sampling, safety of the sampling, and subject's tolerance to the procedure.
