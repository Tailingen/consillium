First-in-human Trial of EGL-001 in Patients with Selected Advanced And/or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This multicenter, open-label, first-in-human, Phase 1/2 study consists of a Part 1 (Phase 1) open-label dose escalation of EGL-001 administered as a single agent and in combination with an anti-PD(L)-1 treatment, followed by a Part 2 (Phase 2) open-label dose expansion of EGL-001 administered at the RP2D in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic solid tumors as monotherapy and/or combination therapy with anti-PD(L)-1.
Solid Tumor, Adult
DRUG: EGL-001
To evaluate the safety, tolerability, dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) leading to the recommended Phase 2 doses (RP2Ds), DLTs occurrence per dose level of EGL-001 during the DLT period (number), Day 1 up to 90 days after last dose|To evaluate the safety, tolerability, dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) leading to the recommended Phase 2 doses (RP2Ds), Proportion of patients with adverse events (AEs) (%), Day 1 up to 90 days after last dose|To evaluate the safety, tolerability, dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) leading to the recommended Phase 2 doses (RP2Ds), Proportion of patients with treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) (%), Day 1 up to 90 days after last dose|To evaluate the safety, tolerability, dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) leading to the recommended Phase 2 doses (RP2Ds), Proportion of patients with serious AEs (SAEs) (%), Day 1 up to 90 days after last dose
To evaluate the preliminary antitumor efficacy (according to RECIST v1.1), ORR: the proportion of patients with complete response (CR) or partial response PR), based on local evaluations using RECIST Version 1.1. (%), From Dose 1 to to the date of first documented tumor progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.|To evaluate the preliminary antitumor efficacy (according to RECIST v1.1), Disease control rate (DCR): the proportion of patients with CR, PR, or stable disease (SD), and assessment of DCR at 6 months (%), From Dose 1 to to the date of first documented tumor progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.|To evaluate the preliminary antitumor efficacy (according to RECIST v1.1), Duration of overall response (DoR): applies only to patients with CR or PR. The start date is the date of first documented response (CR or PR), and the end date is the date of first documented disease progression or the date of death due to underlying cancer (months), From Dose 1 to to the date of first documented tumor progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.|To evaluate the preliminary antitumor efficacy (according to RECIST v1.1), PFS: time from the date of first study treatment administration to the date of first documented tumor progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first (months), From Dose 1 to to the date of first documented tumor progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.|To evaluate the preliminary antitumor efficacy (according to RECIST v1.1), OS: time from the date of first study treatment administration to the date of death due to any cause. If a patient is not known to have died at the cut-off date for analysis, survival will be censored at the date of last contact (months), From Dose 1 to to the date of first documented tumor progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.
In approximately 4 centers in France and 4 centers in Spain, 30 to 50 patients will be included in the dose escalation Part 1 of the trial. Number of participating countries and sites as well as patients will be defined based on Part 1 for Part 2 dose expansion phase.
