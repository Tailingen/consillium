Predictive Factors of Visual Recovery After Paraoptic Tumors Removal
Paraoptic tumors - including mostly sellar meningiomas, pituitary gland adenomas and craniopharyngiomas - classically affect the visual function. Some preoperative factors, determined on retrospective studies, are known to constitute bad prognostic factors, such as duration of symptoms and retinal nerve fiber layer thinning on OCT. We propose to perform a single center prospective study in which detailed preoperative ophthalmological and radiological criteria will be collected before surgery. Intraoperative information will be noted as well. All these data will be statistically examined regarding the postoperative visual recovery at 3, 6 and 12 months
