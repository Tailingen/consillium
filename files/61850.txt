A Study Comparing the Efficacy of L19TNF+Doxorubicin vs Doxorubicin Alone as First-line Therapy in Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Soft Tissue Sarcoma
The present study is an open-label, randomized, controlled, two-arm multi-center study of the efficacy of L19TNF treatment in combination with doxorubicin versus doxorubicin alone in advanced or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma patients.

In the study, 102 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive doxorubicin treatment (Arm 1) or L19TNF treatment in combination with doxorubicin (Arm 2).

The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate if L19TNF in combination with doxorubicin (Arm 2) given for unresectable or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma improves efficacy measured as progression free survival, as compared to doxorubicin alone (Arm 1).

Phase III, open label, randomized, controlled study in subjects with advanced or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma. In the study, 102 patients will be enrolled and parallel assigned in a 1:1 fashion to one of two different arms, as follows:

* ARM 1: Patients will receive 75 mg/m2 doxorubicin once every 3 weeks (reference treatment).
* ARM 2: Patients will receive 13 Âµg/kg L19TNF on days 1, 3 and 5 every 3 weeks in combination with 60 mg/m2 doxorubicin (once every 3 weeks).

Anti-cancer activity will be assessed every 6 weeks during therapy and every 12 weeks thereafter. Median PFS, PFS rates at 3, 6, 9, 12 and 18 months, mOS, OS rate at 12 and 18 months and ORR will be calculated.

Safety assessment will be performed on an ongoing basis during study participation, including standard laboratory assessments. The incidence of AEs will be summarized by severity in all patients with at least one study drug intake.
