Effect of Low-dose Interferon-alfa2a on Peri-operative Immune Suppression
The aim of this randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled phase 2 study is to determine efficacy of preoperative treatment with interferon-alfa2a in patients with pMMR colon cancer on perioperative immune suppression and infiltration of lymphocytes in the primary tumor.
