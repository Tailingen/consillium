Body Surface Area-based vs Concentration-based Dosing of Cisplatin for Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) in Women With Advanced Ovarian Cancer
Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) with the addition of hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is used in current clinical practice in selected patients with advanced ovarian cancer. Clinical evidence for the benefit of HIPEC in ovarian cancer comes from the pivotal phase 3 OVHIPEC trial. Worldwide, two established strategies exist for dosing of HIPEC protocols, which follow either a body surface area (BSA)-based or a concentration-based approach. Since both strategies result in different exposure to intra-peritoneal chemotherapy, we aim to compare the pharmacokinetics and safety of both strategies.
