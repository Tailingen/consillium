Survey of Current Interventional and Diagnostic Imaging Residents After Participation in Endovascular Simulator Training
This study looks at the comfort of interventional and diagnostic imaging residents in performing simulated endovascular procedures after completing training on the Mentice endovascular simulator device. Implementation of a training curriculum with radiology residents interested in interventional radiology will help facilitate hands-on training in a low-risk environment and allow for safer future patient encounters.
