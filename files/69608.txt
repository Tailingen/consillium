Study to Assess Allogeneic Anti-CD38 A2 Dimeric Antigen Receptor T Cells in Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
This is a phase 1b, open-label, dose-escalation study of STI-1492 administered by a single intravenous infusion in subjects with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.
Multiple Myeloma
BIOLOGICAL: STI-1492
Safety of STI-1492, Safety as assessed by incidence of adverse events, SAEs, DLTs, neurotoxicity, cytokine release syndrome, host rejection, and laboratory abnormalities, Baseline through study completion at up to approximately 54 months
Overall response and duration, Response and duration according to the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) response criteria, Baseline through study completion at up to approximately 54 months|Assessment of improvements in hypercalcemia, renal function, anemia and lytic bone lesions (CRAB criteria), Assessment of improvement in CRAB criteria, Baseline through study completion at up to approximately 54 months|Assessment of serum immunoglobulin levels, Assessment of serum immunoglobulin levels, Baseline through study completion at up to approximately 54 months
This is a phase 1b, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study of STI-1492 administered by a single intravenous infusion in subjects with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

The study will determine the MTD and RP2D, assessing safety and preliminary efficacy using a conventional 3+3 study design with two design stages, an ascending dose stage followed by an expansion study.

Patients will be enrolled sequentially within each cohort and between cohorts during the dose escalation portion of the study with the staggered intervals of at least 28 days. Only one patient will be allowed to receive study treatment at any time through the end of the staggering period before the next subject may begin study treatment.
