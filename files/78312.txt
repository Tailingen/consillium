Study of Paclitaxel, Carboplatin, and Cetuximab for Advanced Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the role of cetuximab (Erbitux) with chemotherapy for advanced colorectal carcinoma. This study will determine if this new agent can improve one's response to standard treatment.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
DRUG: Cetuximab
To determine the response rate and stable disease rate with this combination regimen
To determine the clinical benefit (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR] + static disease [SD])|Time to progression|Survival rate|As well as toxicity evaluation
This research study is being done to determine if cetuximab will improve efficacy of standard chemotherapy. This agent targets epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). EGFR sits on the outside of tumor cells and controls tumor cell growth. This agent has been looked at alone and with other chemotherapy drugs in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It has shown to be safe and can shrink tumors. There is little information about the combination of this agent with both paclitaxel and carboplatin. This study combines cetuximab with monthly carboplatin and weekly paclitaxel.
