ASPEN-09: A Study of Evorpacept in Combination With Anti-cancer Therapies in Advanced / Metastatic Malignancies
The purpose of this study is to evaluate evorpacept with anti-cancer therapies in advanced/metastatic malignancies. The study is comprised of the following substudies:

* Metastatic HER2+ breast cancer (MBC) - randomized 1:1 to one of two arms (evorpacept + standard of care therapy vs. standard of care only)
* Metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) - dose escalation phase to evaluate evorpacept in combination with other drugs
* Recurrent/metastatic head and neck cancer (HNSCC) - note that this substudy will not be open at the time of study initiation
Breast Cancer, Metastatic|Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Evorpacept (ALX148)|DRUG: Cetuximab|DRUG: FOLFIRI (Irinotecan, 5-Fluorouracil, and Leucovorin)|DRUG: Trastuzumab|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Capecitabine|DRUG: Eribulin|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Vinorelbine
MBC substudy: Overall Response Rate, ORR per RECIST version 1.1 based on blinded independent central read (BICR), defined as a best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), Approximately 6 months after the last participant is randomized|CRC substudy: Determine the safety and tolerability of evorpacept in combination with cetuximab and FOLFIRI, Dose limiting toxicities for all participants enrolled in the dose escalation phase who received at least one dose of evorpacept and completed the DLT evaluation., 28 days from the first dose of evorpacept|CRC substudy: Determine the MAD/MTD, the RP2D and recommended regimen, AEs as characterized by type, frequency, severity, timing, seriousness and relationship to study drug in all treated participants, 28 days from first dose of evorpacept
MBC substudy: Assess secondary measures of efficacy, ORR based on Investigator assessment; CBR, DoR and PFS, using RECIST 1.1 based on BICR and Investigator assessment, and OS, Approximately 6 months after the last participant is randomized|MBC substudy: Evaluate the safety profile of evorpacept in combination with trastuzumab and each of the chemotherapy regimens, AEs as characterized by type, frequency, severity (as graded by NCI CTCAE v5.0), timing, seriousness, and relationship to study drug. Laboratory abnormalities as characterized by type, frequency, severity, and timing., Enrollment to 28 days after the last administration of the study drug|All substudies: Characterize single and multiple dose PK of evorpacept, Based on pharmacokinetic parameters of evorpacept such as Cmax, Tmax, AUC, CL and t1/2, Approximately 6 months after the last participant is randomized|All substudies: Evaluate the immunogenicity of evorpacept, Measured by presence of human serum ADA (anti-evorpacept antibodies), Approximately 6 months after the last participant is randomized|CRC substudy: Evaluate the overall safety profile of evorpacept in combination with other agents, Laboratory abnormalities as characterized by type, frequency, severity and timing for all enrolled participants who received at least one dose of evorpacept, Enrollment to 28 days after the last administration of the study drug|CRC substudy: Evaluate the anti-tumor activity of evorpacept, Determined by ORR per Investigator Assessment using RECIST 1.1 and DCR by Investigator assessment per RECIST v1.1, DoR, PFS and OS in all enrolled participants who receive at least 1 dose any study drug and undergo at least one post-baseline disease assessment., Approximately 6 months after the last participant is randomized
Participants will continue study treatment until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, participant request to stop treatment, investigator decision or study termination by the sponsor.

Not all substudies may be active and/or open to enrollment at a given time. Not all study centers may be participating in every substudy.
