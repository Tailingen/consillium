Eribulin and Lenvatinib in Advanced Solid Tumors
The overall purpose of this study is to determine the overall response rate, efficacy and safety of the combination of eribulin and Lenvatinib.
Cancer|Solid Tumor
DRUG: Eribulin|DRUG: Lenvatinib
Overall Response Rate of Lenvatinib and Eribulin (Phase II), Defined as the percentage of patients with best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as assessed by independent imaging review., The overall response rate will be assessed after two cycles of therapy (1 cycle = 3 weeks) until the date of first documentation of disease progression or death (whichever occurs first) over an average of 18 months.|Progression Free Survival, Progression-free survival (PFS) will be defined as the time from the first study treatment to the first occurrence of progression or death., Baseline to 50 months
Overall Survival Rate, Baseline to 50 months|Lenvatinib and Eribulin Toxicities Will be Graded Using NCI CTCAE Version 4.03, Adverse events are graded in the NCI CTCAE version 4.03 scale and reported by number of adverse events per grade, Safety will be evaluated from the time of registration until 30 days after last dose of treatment, resolution of the related AE or death up to 40 months.
This is a phase II clinical trial of the combination of eribulin, and Lenvatinib. A cycle will be defined as 21 days. Eribulin will be given on days 1 and 8 of each cycle. Lenvatinib will be given daily during each cycle.
