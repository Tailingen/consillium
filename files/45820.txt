Ocular Mysathenia Gravis Generalization
Secondary ocular myasthenia gravis (OMG) generalization represents a pejorative evolution and no validated generalization prevention strategy exists. The aim of this observational study was to determine the percentage of patients with OMG generalization and identify factors predictive of that pejorative evolution. Data from patients with OMG registered in the Fondation Hospital A. de Rothschild database between January 1990 and January 2017 were collected. Among the 183 patients registered in this database, 151 patients with available informations were analyzed.

OTHER: Use of nomogram for predictions of Ocular Mysathenia Gravis generalization
Time to myasthenia gravis generalization, Kaplan-meier survival estimations, descriptive and multivariate Cox model analyses were computed (age at onset, first year anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody positivity, electromyogram decrement, steroid use)., 1 year
