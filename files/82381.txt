Skin Cancer Oncology Radiation Evidence Registry
To collect and analyze long term safety and efficacy outcomes of patients undergoing radiotherapy for non-melanoma skin cancer. A target of 400 VMAT-treated sites is set which is estimated to be identified in approximately 350 participants. Participants referred for radiotherapy for the management of non-melanoma skin cancer.
Non-melanoma Skin Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: There is no medical intervention for the purposes of this Registry.
Participants will have their responses to radiotherapy after treatment of non-melanoma skin cancer measured and reported as number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0., To assess participant safety following treatment of non-melanoma skin cancers with radiotherapy., 5 years
The Registry will collect information on key clinical indications and patient reported outcomes to assess the safety and efficacy of VMAT radiotherapy. Data that will be collected includes baseline data of demographic, relevant medical history, photographs, treatment schedule, and treatment outcomes. Data may be collected retrospectively in regard to previous relevant medical history, prior treatments and outcomes as well as prospectively, including treatment schedule and treatment outcomes of radiotherapy treatment.

The Registry aims to assess the safety and outcomes of treatment for up to 5 years. This Registry will be the first of its kind in the US and will provide a basis for a number of potential research publications. The Registry will also give insights into treatment delivery and potentially facilitate future improvements in patient care.
