Open-label Phase 1b Study of ARQ 092 in Combination With Anastrozole
An Open-label Phase 1b Study of ARQ 092 in Combination with other Antineoplastic Agents in Subjects with Selected Solid Tumors
Solid Tumors|Ovarian Cancer|Endometrial Cancer
DRUG: ARQ 092 + carboplatin + paclitaxel (Closed)|DRUG: ARQ 092 + paclitaxel (Closed)|DRUG: ARQ 092 + anastrozole
Number of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) as assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03, The incidence of adverse events will be assessed as a measure of the safety and tolerability profile of ARQ 092, Assessed at each scheduled visit up to treatment discontinuation + 30 days with an estimated treatment duration of 3 to 24 weeks|Overall Response Rate (ORR) based on central review of tumor measurement using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, ORR will be assessed as a measure of efficacy, Baseline and every 2 cycles (8 weeks) after the first dose of ARQ 092 during the first 6 cycles (24 weeks) of treatment, and every 3 cycles (12 weeks) thereafter or as clinically indicated, and at the End of Treatment.|Progression Free Survival (PFS) based on central review of tumor measurement using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, PFS will be assessed as a measure of efficacy, Baseline and every 2 cycles (8 weeks) after the first dose of ARQ 092 during the first 6 cycles (24 weeks) of treatment, and every 3 cycles (12 weeks) thereafter or as clinically indicated, and at the End of Treatment.|Duration of Response (DoR) based on central review of tumor measurement, DoR will be assessed as a measure of efficacy, Baseline and every 2 cycles (8 weeks) after the first dose of ARQ 092 during the first 6 cycles (24 weeks) of treatment, and every 3 cycles (12 weeks) thereafter or as clinically indicated, and at the End of Treatment.
Peak plasma concentration (Cmax), During Cycle 1, Day 1 and Cycle 2, Day 1 of treatment (t=0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 hours post ARQ 092 dose). And at Cycle 1, Day 8, Day 15, and Day 22 (t = pre-dose ARQ 092 dose).|Area under the plasma concentration vs. time curve (AUC), During Cycle 1, Day 1 and Cycle 2, Day 1 of treatment (t=0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 hours post ARQ 092 dose). And at Cycle 1, Day 8, Day 15, and Day 22 (t = pre-dose ARQ 092 dose).|Half-life of ARQ 092, During Cycle 1, Day 1 and Cycle 2, Day 1 of treatment (t=0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 hours post ARQ 092 dose). And at Cycle 1, Day 8, Day 15, and Day 22 (t = pre-dose ARQ 092 dose).
This is an open-label Phase 1b, dose escalation study of oral ARQ 092 administered in combination with carboplatin plus paclitaxel (Carboplatin Plus Paclitaxel Arm) or in combination with paclitaxel alone (Paclitaxel Arm), in subjects with advanced, inoperable metastatic and/or recurrent solid tumors, or in combination with anastrozole (Anastrozole Arm) in subjects with ovarian or endometrial cancer.

Enrollment in the Carboplatin plus Paclitaxel Arm and Paclitaxel Alone Arm is now closed. Enrollment in the Expansion Cohort for the Anastrozole Arm continues for patients with Endometrial cancer.
