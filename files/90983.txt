Adjuvant Radiotherapy(Postoperative radiotherapy) is proposed in stage II and III thymic carcinoma，stage III thymoma，stage IIB B2/B3 thymomas.

Hypofractionation Radiotherapy is used in this study. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficiency and toxicity of adjuvant hypofractionation radiotherapy for thymic epithelial tumours after complete resection.
