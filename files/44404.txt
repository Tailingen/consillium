Home-based HIIT to Improve CRC Survivorship: Feasibility and Relationship With Novel Surrogate Biomarkers of CRC Recurrence
This 12-week, exercise study will assess the feasibility of a home-based high-intensity interval training (HIIT) program among colorectal cancer survivors and explore the impact of home-based HIIT compared to a standard home-based moderate-intensity continuous aerobic exercise program on physical outcomes linked with survival from colorectal cancer and surrogate blood markers of colorectal cancer recurrence.

HIIT is a type of aerobic exercise that includes short bursts (i.e. 1-4 minutes) of vigorous exercise followed by longer periods of moderate to lower intensity exercise (i.e. 1-10 minutes). Participants in this study will be randomly assigned into a personalized home based exercise program - either high-intensity interval training (HIIT) or moderate-intensity continuous aerobic exercise (MICE).

This pilot study will provide us with preliminary evidence for a larger trial aimed to compare the effectiveness of these two different types of home-based exercise programs on physical outcomes linked with survival, quality of life, and surrogate blood markers of colorectal cancer recurrence.

BEHAVIORAL: Home-based high-intensity interval training|BEHAVIORAL: Home-based moderate-intensity continuous exercise
Feasibility of home-based high-intensity interval training among colorectal cancer survivors, Feasibility will be assessed by adherence to the home-based high-intensity interval training protocol, which is defined at the participant level as completing ≥70% of workouts consistent with the exercise prescription. The intervention will be considered feasible if ≥75% of participants meet or exceed the 70% criterion., 12 weeks
