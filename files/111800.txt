Timolol Maleate Gel for the Treatment of Infantile Hemangioma
The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of timolol maleate (TM) gel in subjects with superficial infantile hemangioma (IH) in the proliferative phase. The main question it aims to answer is:

• The primary endpoint (success or failure) assessment was a centralized and independent qualitative assessment based on blinded comparison on B-ultrasonography results and photographs of IH at W24 from baseline.

Researchers will compare TM gel to a placebo (a look-alike substance that contains no drug) to see if TM gel works to treat IH.

Participants will:

* Take the study drug 3 times daily (once in the morning, noon, and evening, respectively) for 24 weeks.
* The family members of patients are instructed to bring the patients to the clinic for regular follow-up visits at Week 4 (W4), Week 12 (W12), and Week 24 (W24) of the treatment period.
* Keep a diary of concomitant medications and adverse events.

DRUG: Timolol Maleate Gel+Placebo|DRUG: Timolol Maleate Gel|DRUG: Placebo
Success rate of cure of IH after 24-week treatment., Treatment success is defined as complete or almost complete resolution of the patient's IH at W24 compared with baseline.

At the time of centralized independent assessment., 24 weeks
Changes in the hemangioma volume, Changes in the hemangioma volume from baseline after treatment for 4, 12 and 24 weeks, adopting the estimation formula of IH volume: V = 0.07×(the average of the hemangioma's longest length and width)\^3., baseline, week 4, 12 and 24|Changes in hemangioma color, Change in the color of hemangioma after 4, 12, and 24 weeks of treatment, which is assessed by the CEA (Clinician Erythema Assessment) criteria.The color intensity (e.g., no signs of erythema;slight redness;defined redness;marked redness;fiery redness.) of the IH is assessed on a 5 point scale., baseline, weeks 4, 12 and 24|Complete/almost complete regression rates of IH from baseline after 4 and 12-week treatment., At the time of centralized independent assessment., baseline, weeks 4 and 12|Complete/almost complete resolution rate of IH at each post-baseline visit (Weeks 4, 12, and 24) from baseline., On-site qualitative assessment by the investigator of efficacy., baseline, Weeks 4, 12, and 24|Evolution of IH at each post-baseline visit(Weeks 4, 12, and 24) from baseline., Classified into 5 categories: completely/almost completely resolved, improved, stable, aggravated, and not assessable.

On-site qualitative assessment by the investigator of efficacy., baseline, Weeks 4, 12 and 24|Changes in IH at each post-baseline visit(Weeks 4, 12, and 24) compared to the previous visit., Classified into 5 categories: complete/almost complete regression, relief, stabilization, exacerbation, and unable to determine.
