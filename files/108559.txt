Study Of SU011248 Versus Chemotherapy For Patients With Previously Treated Triple Receptor Negative Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to compare progression free survival for SU011248 \[sutent (sunitinib malate)\] versus standard of care therapy in patients with previously treated, advanced, triple receptor negative (ER, PR, HER2) locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer.
Breast Neoplasms
DRUG: SU011248|DRUG: Chemotherapy
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Time in months from start of study treatment to first documentation of objective tumor progression (per RECIST) or death due to any cause. PFS was calculated as (first event date minus first randomization date plus 1) divided by 30.4. Tumor progression was determined from oncologic assessment data (where data meet the criteria for progressive disease \[PD\]), or from adverse event (AE) data (where the outcome was "Death")., Baseline, every 6 weeks until disease progression or death (up to 3 years from first dose)
Proportion of Participants With Objective Response, Objective response based assessment of confirmed response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) according to RECIST. CR are those that persist on repeat imaging study at least 4 weeks after initial documentation of response. PR are those with a greater than or equal to (â‰¥) 30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions (SLD) of the target lesions taking as a reference the baseline SLD., Baseline until response or disease progression (up to 3 years from first dose)|Duration of Response (DR), Time in months from the first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR) to objective tumor progression or death. Duration of tumor response was calculated as (the date of the first documentation of objective tumor progression or death due to cancer minus the date of the first CR or PR that was subsequently confirmed plus 1) divided by 30.4. DR was calculated for the subgroup of participants with a confirmed objective tumor response., Time from first response to disease progression up to 3 years from first dose|Survival Probability at 1 Year, Probability that the participants will survive at end of 1 year from the first dose of study treatment. Calculated using data collected from baseline until death (up to 3 years after first dose of study medication). Probability calculated from Kaplan-Meier estimate., Baseline until death (up to 3 years after first dose of study medication)|Overall Survival (OS), Time in months from the date of randomization to date of death due to any cause. OS was calculated as (date of death minus randomization date plus 1) divided by 30.4. Death was determined from adverse event data (where outcome was death) or from follow-up contact data (where the participant current status was death)., Baseline until death (up to 3 years after first dose of study medication)|Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and Disease Related Symptoms as Measured by European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life (QoL) Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-C30), EORTC QLQ-C30: global health/QoL, functional domains (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, social), and symptom scales/items (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea). Recall period: past week; response range: not at all to very much; global/QoL range: very poor to excellent. Scale score range: 0 to 100. Higher functional/global QoL score = better functioning and higher symptom score = greater degree of symptoms., Day 1, Cycle 1; Day 1, odd number cycles; and end of treatment (EOT)/withdrawal|HRQoL and Disease Related Symptoms as Measured by EORTC-QLQ-C30 Breast Cancer Module (BR23) Score, BR23: measured disease related symptoms of dry mouth, eye pain, hair loss, hot flushes, attractiveness, future health, sexual activity, arm/shoulder pain, breast pain, swollen breast, and skin problems on the breast. Recall period: past week; response range: not at all to very much. Scale score range: 0 to 100. Higher symptom score = greater degree of symptoms., Day 1, Cycle 1; Day 1, odd number cycles; and EOT/withdrawal|Observed Plasma Trough Concentrations (Ctrough) of Sunitinib, Predose Day 1, Cycles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 and Day 15 of Cycles 1, 2, and 3|Ctrough of SU012662 (Metabolite of Sunitinib), Predose Day 1, Cycles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 and Day 15 of Cycles 1, 2, and 3|Ctrough of Total Drug (Sunitinib + SU012662), Predose Day 1, Cycles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 and Day 15 of Cycles 1, 2, and 3|Dose-corrected Ctrough of Sunitinib, Ctrough = plasma concentration of sunitinib prior to study drug administration, dose corrected using the following formula Intended Dose/Actual Dose, where Actual Dose: the dose the participant received over the last 10 consecutive days and Intended Dose: the starting dose per study protocol., Predose Day 1, Cycles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 and Day 15 of Cycles 1, 2, and 3|Dose-corrected Ctrough of SU012662 (Metabolite of Sunitinib), Ctrough = plasma concentration of SU012662 prior to study drug administration, dose corrected using the following formula Intended Dose/Actual Dose, where Actual Dose: the dose the participant received over the last 10 consecutive days and Intended Dose: the starting dose per study protocol., Predose Day 1, Cycles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 and Day 15 of Cycles 1, 2, and 3|Dose-corrected Ctrough of Total Drug (Sunitinib + SU012662), Ctrough = plasma concentration of total drug (Sunitinib + SU012662) prior to study drug administration dose corrected using the following formula Intended Dose/Actual Dose, where Actual Dose: the dose the participant received over the last 10 consecutive days and Intended Dose: the starting dose per study protocol., Predose Day 1, Cycles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 and Day 15 of Cycles 1, 2, and 3|Plasma Concentration of Soluble Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 2 (sVEGFR2), Plasma concentrations of sVEGFR2 were examined as a potential pharmacodynamic marker, Baseline (Cycle 1, Day 1), Day 1 (Cycles 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7), and EOT/withdrawal|Plasma Concentration of Soluble Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 3 (sVEGFR3), Plasma concentrations of sVEGFR3 were examined as a potential pharmacodynamic marker, Baseline (Cycle 1, Day 1), Day 1 (Cycles 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7), and EOT/withdrawal|Plasma Concentration of Soluble Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A (sVEGF-A), Plasma concentrations of sVEGF-A were examined as a potential pharmacodynamic marker, Baseline (Cycle 1, Day 1), Day 1 (Cycles 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7), and EOT/withdrawal|Plasma Concentration of Soluble Placental Growth Factor (sPlGF), Plasma concentrations of sPlGF were examined as a potential pharmacodynamic marker, Baseline (Cycle 1, Day 1), Day 1 (Cycles 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7), and EOT/withdrawal|Plasma Concentration of Soluble Kinase Insert Domain for Tyrosine (sKIT), a Stem Cell Factor Receptor, Plasma concentrations of sKIT were examined as a potential pharmacodynamic marker, Baseline (Cycle 1, Day 1), Day 1 (Cycles 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7), and EOT/withdrawal|Circulating Endothelial Cells (CEC), Blood samples were collected to enumerate the number of total CECs and sVEGFR1, sVEGFR2 and sVEGFR3 protein expression and/or cellular viability., Days 1 and 15 of Cycles 1, 2 and 3, Day 1 of Cycles 4 and 5, and every odd cycle thereafter, and EOT/withdrawal|Circulating Tumor Cells (CTC), Blood samples were collected to enumerate the number of total CTCs and insulin growth factor 1R positive (IGF-1R+) CTCs, Days 1 and 15 of Cycles 1, 2 and 3, Day 1 of Cycles 4 and 5, and every odd cycle thereafter, and EOT/withdrawal
