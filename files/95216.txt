Intestinal Flora Sequencing for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
This study investigated the correlation between the changes in the intestinal flora and NPC by an examination of the intestinal flora and multiple clinical indicators of the blood of 8 carefully screened patients of familial NPC, 24 patients of sporadic NPC and 27 healthy controls and a comparison of the differences in their intestinal flora structures and biological functions. By analyzing the function of the intestinal floras of NPC patients, we aimed to provide a better biological marker for patients with familial and sporadic NPC and constructed a disease prediction model for high-risk populations.

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a malignant nasopharyngeal disease with a complicated etiology that occurs mostly in southern China. Intestinal flora imbalance is believed to be associated with a variety of organ malignancies. Currently, the relationship between intestinal flora and NPC is not clear, although many studies have shown that intestinal flora can be used as a biomarker for many cancers and to predict cancer.

To compare the differences in intestinal flora compositions and biological functions among patients with familial NPC (NPC_F), patients with sporadic NPC (NPC_S) and healthy controls (NOR), we compared the intestinal flora DNA sequencing and hematological testing results between every two groups using bioinformatic methods.
