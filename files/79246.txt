Clinical Trial of a Therapeutic Vaccine With NY-ESO-1 in Combination With the Adjuvant Monophosphoryl Lipid A (MPLA)
This study is a clinical trial phase I/II. Its goal is to determine the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and efficacy of a therapeutic vaccine with the tumor antigen NY-ESO-1 combined with the adjuvant MPLA from B. pertussis in cancer patients.
Cancer.|Melanoma.|Ovarian Cancer.|Lung Cancer.
BIOLOGICAL: NY-ESO-1 combined with MPLA|BIOLOGICAL: NY-ESO-1 combined with MPLA vaccine
Safety, CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events), Six months after immunization.
Immunogenicity, IgG against NY-ESO-1 (ELISA). NY-ESO-1-specific T cells CD4+ and CD8+ (ELISPOT and FACs - flow citometry with tetramers)., Six months after immunization.
The safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine with the antigen NY-ESO-1 in combination with the MPLA will be evaluated in a phase 1 clinical trial conducted in patients with malignancies that express the antigen (lung, ovarian and melanoma). This study will involve 15 patients, who will receive 250 mcg of NY-ESO-1 and 100 mcg of MPLA.
