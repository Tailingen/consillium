DRUG: ME-401|DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Zanubrutinib
Minimum Biologically Effective Dose (mBED) of ME-401 alone, The mBED will be defined as the dose that is safe and that achieves an objective response rate that is not less than 30%., 1 year|Maximally Tolerated Dose (MTD) of ME-401 alone, The MTD will be determined as the maximum dose that is safe. DLT rate closest to .25 and not to exceed 2 DLTs in 6 subjects, 1 year|Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) of ME-401 alone, DLTs will be measured by the number of treatment related AEs that occur within the first 56 days of ME-401 administration, is considered clinically significant by the P.I. and occurs in the presence of supportive care, within the first 56 days|Evaluate the safety and tolerability of ME-401 plus rituximab, Safety and tolerability will be measured by the number of treatment related AEs, 1 year|Determine the MTD of ME-401 plus zanubrutinib, The MTD of ME-401 is defined as the dose level with a DLT rate closest to 0.25., 1 year|Determine the DLTs of ME-401 plus zanubrutinib, DLTs will be measured by the number of treatment related AEs that occur within the first 56 days of ME-401 plus zanubrutinib, within the first 56 days|Evaluate the safety and tolerability of ME-401 plus zanubrutinib, Safety and tolerability will be measured by the number of treatment related AEs, 1 year
Safety profile of ME-401 alone, Safety profile will be measured by number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, 1 year|Efficacy of ME-401 alone as assessed by (OR), The efficacy of ME-401 alone will be assessed by the overall response (OR) of subjects which is calculated as the percent of subjects achieving complete response (CR), minimal disease negativity (MRD), duration of response (DOR) and progression free survival (PFS)., 2 years|Evaluate the (AUC) PK of ME-401 alone, Determined by the Area Under the Concentration time curve (AUC), 2 years|Evaluate the PK (Cmax) of ME-401 alone, Determined by Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax), 2 years|Efficacy of ME-401 with rituximab, The efficacy of ME-401 with Rituximab will be determined by the overall response (OR) of subjects calculated as the percent of subjects achieving a complete remission (CR), duration of response (DOR) or Progression Free survival (PFS) according to the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (iwCLL), 2 years|Evaluate the PK (AUC) of ME-401 with rituximab, Determined by the Area Under the Concentration time curve (AUC), 2 years|Evaluate the PK (Cmax) of ME-401 with rituximab, Determined by Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax), 2 years|Efficacy of ME-401 with zanubrutinib, The efficacy of ME-401 with zanubrutinib will be assessed by the overall response (OR) of subjects calculated as the percent of subjects achieving a complete remission (CR), Duration of response (DOR) and progression free survival (PFS), 2 years|Evaluate the PK (AUC) of ME-401 in combination with zanubrutinib, Determined by the Area Under the Concentration time curve (AUC), 2 years|Evaluate the PK (Cmax) of ME-401 in combination with zanubrutinib, Determined by Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax), 2 years
This is a three-arm study of ME-401 alone, of ME-401 in combination with rituximab, and of ME-401 in combination with zanubrutinib in subjects with relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL or B cell NHL. The 3 arms of the study will be conducted in parallel, with subject allocation to ME-401 alone, ME-401 plus rituximab, or ME-401 plus zanubrutinib based on disease type and availability of an open enrollment slot.
