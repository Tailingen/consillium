Docetaxel, Carboplatin, and Rucaparib Camsylate in Treating Patients With Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer With Homologous Recombination DNA Repair Deficiency
This phase II trial studies how well docetaxel with carboplatin followed by rucaparib camsylate works in treating patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (spread outside of prostate and resistant to testosterone suppression) with homologous recombination DNA repair deficiency. Chemotherapy drugs, such as docetaxel and carboplatin, work to stop the growth of cancer cells, by stopping them from dividing or spreading. Rucaparib camsylate may stop the growth of tumor cells with defects in the ability to repair mistakes in DNA by forcing additional errors so that the cancer cells cannot overcome the number of errors and will then die. Giving induction docetaxel and carboplatin followed by maintenance rucaparib camsylate may work better in treating patients with castration resistant prostate cancer.

OUTLINE:

INDUCTION: Patients receive docetaxel intravenously (IV) and carboplatin IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

MAINTENANCE: Patients receive rucaparib camsylate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
