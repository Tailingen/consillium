A Study Of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC) Treated With Celecoxib And ZD1839
EGFR and COX-2 are involved in tumorigenesis, angiogenesis and metastases and are frequently over expressed in NPC.COX-2 and EGFR inhibitors are active in NPC.There is synergistic action between COX-2 and EGFR inhibitors.

Study hypothesis: Celecoxib and gefitinib can reduce angiogenesis and induce anti-tumorigenicity in patients with nasopharngeal cancer.
