Albumin-bound Paclitaxel Combined With Gemcitabine First-line Inoperable Pancreatic Cancer
This study aims to further observe and evaluate whether the three-week administration of albumin-bound paclitaxel combined with gemcitabine is equivalent to the four-week administration in the treatment of inoperable locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer
Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: albumin-bound paclitaxel
Progression-free Survival (PFS), From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, through study completion, an average of 5year
Disease Control Rate(DCR), The percentage of confirmed complete remission, partial remission and stable disease among patients with evaluable efficacy, through study completion, an average of 5year|Objective response rate(ORR), The proportion of patients whose tumors have shrunk to a certain level and maintained for a certain period of time, including CR and PR cases.The solid tumor response assessment standard (RECIST 1.1 standard) was used to assess the objective tumor response.The subject must have measurable tumor lesions at baseline.According to the RECIST 1.1 standard, the efficacy evaluation criteria are divided into complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR), stable (SD), and progress (PD), through study completion, an average of 5year|Overall survival(OS), From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, through study completion, an average of 5year
Pancreatic cancer is a common clinical malignant tumor of the digestive system, and its incidence is gradually increasing worldwide.The prognosis is poor and the mortality rate is high, accounting for about 7% of cancer deaths.Albumin-bound paclitaxel is a good first-line treatment for pancreatic cancer. It has the advantages of high dose, high tumor tissue distribution, high efficacy, and low toxicity.It is hoped that the low-dose intensity can achieve the same clinical efficacy as the high-dose intensity, which provides strong evidence for the clinical choice of low-dose intensity.
