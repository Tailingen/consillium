Nivolumab and AVD in Early-stage Unfavorable Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma
The aim of the trial is to improve first-line treatment for early unfavorable cHL by introduction of the anti-PD-1 antibody Nivolumab with a truncated standard chemotherapy (AVD).

The primary objective is to show efficacy of the two experimental treatment strategies. Secondary objectives are to further evaluate efficacy, show safety and feasibility and perform correlative studies.
