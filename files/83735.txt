CTC Immune Checkpoint
This pilot study will explore the prevalence of expression of four immune checkpoint biomarkers on circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from men with metastatic prostate cancer that are captured by EpCAM via the CellSearch method, and specifically defined as co expressing DAPI and cytokeratin, and lacking CD45 expression.
Prostate Cancer
DEVICE: CTC biomarker expression prevalence
