Water-based Versus Land-based Exercise for Breast Cancer Survivors
Physical activity and exercise have demonstrated to be an integral part of the cancer-continuum care. Despite strong evidence suggesting that both endurance and strength training should be encourage in cancer patients, there is still controversy regarding exercise dosage, frequency, volume and optimal environment of delivery. In this randomised controlled trial we aim to compare water-based versus land-based exercise in breast cancer survivors to decrease cancer-related fatigue (CRF), improve Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL), exercise tolerance, muscle strength and physical activity levels.
