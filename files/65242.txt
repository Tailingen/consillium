Each item is scored from 0 to 10, with '0' indicating that the symptom was either not present or did not interfere with their activities, and '10' indicating that the symptom was "as bad as you can imagine" or "interfered completely" with their life. The 2 subscales, symptom severity score and symptom interference score were average of respective items and ranged from 0 to 10, higher score indicating greater severity or interference of symptoms., Cycle 1 Day 1 (baseline), every 2 weeks for the first 2 months (Cycle 2 Day 1 [C2D1], Cycle 3 Day 1, and Cycle 4 Day 1) then monthly thereafter starting Cycle 6 Day 1, and 28 days after the last dose
