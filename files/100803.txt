Biomarkers in Bone Marrow Samples From Young Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia
RATIONALE: Studying samples of bone marrow from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer.

PURPOSE: This research study is looking at biomarkers in bone marrow samples from young patients with acute myeloid leukemia.
Leukemia
GENETIC: RNA analysis|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis
miR expression patterns in pediatric AML are regulated by the niche MSC-associated microenvironment|Exposure of AML cells to the niche MSCs generate changes in pediatric AML miR expression profiles|Correlation between changes in pediatric AML miR expression profiles and changes in biological behavior of AML cells (dormant versus invasive)
OBJECTIVES:

* To study the effect of niche mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) exposure on microRNAs (miR) expression in pediatric AML at different time points and compare those profiles to the miR profiles at baseline.
* To focus on four pediatric AML-specific miRs (miR34a, miR538e, miR193e, and miR198) which show the most significant differential expression after in vivo niche exposure at four months (hematogenous spread).
* To determine whether altered miR expression reflects or causes the metastatic invasion pattern of AML.

OUTLINE: Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) samples are implanted subcutaneously in NOD/SCID mice. Cells are then harvested at day 0, 1 month, and 4 months post-implantation. miRNA is isolated and analyzed by Ilumina MicroRNA Expression Profiling single Beadchip. The obtained data is then analyzed by the Illumina Genome Studio Analysis Software.
