A Study to Evaluate the Tolerance, Efficacy and Pharmacokinetics of TQB3454 Tablets
This is a open-label, multicenter, phase I study to evaluate tolerance and pharmacokinetics of TQB3454 tablets in subjects with advanced solid tumor or hematologic tumor.
Advanced Solid Tumor or Hematologic Tumor
DRUG: TQB3454
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), MTD was defined as the dose in which more than 2 of up to 6 patients developed a DLT., Baseline up to 28 days
Cmax, Cmax is the maximum plasma concentration of TQB3454 or metabolite(s)., Hour 0(pre-dose), 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 10, 24, 48, 72, 120, 168 hours post-dose on single dose;|Tmax, To characterize the pharmacokinetics of TQB3454 by assessment of time to reach maximum plasma concentration., Hour 0(pre-dose), 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 10, 24, 48, 72, 120, 168 hours post-dose on single dose;|AUC0-t, To characterize the pharmacokinetics of TQB3454 by assessment of area under the plasma concentration time curve from zero to infinity., Hour 0(pre-dose), 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 10, 24, 48, 72, 120, 168 hours post-dose on single dose;|Objective response rate (ORR), Percentage of participants achieving complete response (CR) and partial response (PR)., up to 60 weeks|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS defined as the time from first dose to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause., Up to 60 weeks|2-hydroxyglutaric acid, Correlation between 2-hydroxyglutaric acid and efficacy, Hour 0(pre-dose) on single dose; Hour 0(pre-dose) of day1, day8, day15, day28 on multiple dose of first cycle; hour 0(pre-dose) of day15, day28 of second and third cycle; hour 0(pre-dose) of day28 of fourth to eighth cycle.Each cycle is 28 days.
