A Study Evaluating Atezolizumab, With or Without Bevacizumab, in Participants With Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Child-Pugh B7 and B8 Cirrhosis
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety of atezolizumab and bevacizumab, or atezolizumab alone, as first-line treatment in participants with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with Child-Pugh B7 or B8 cirrhosis.
