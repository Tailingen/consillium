Evaluation of Gixam's Efficacy Predicting Pre-cancerous Colorectal Polyps and Colorectal Cancer
This is a prospective, single arm, multi-center clinical investigation aim to demonstrate the efficacy of Gixam in predicting the presence of premalignant colorectal polyps and colorectal cancer (CRC) in a fecal immunochemical test (FIT) positive population.
Colorectal Cancer|Colorectal Adenomatous Polyp|Colorectal Neoplasms
DEVICE: Gixam System
Safety - number of device related adverse events and serious adverse events, Number of device related adverse events and serious adverse events, Through study completion, up to 30 days|Efficacy - Gixam's sensitivity and specificity, Gixam's sensitivity and specificity to predict the presence of premalignant neoplastic colorectal polyps (advanced premalignant neoplastic lesions/non-advanced premalignant neoplastic lesion) and CRC, Through study completion, up to 30 days
1. Average risk persons eligible for CRC screening that have received a positive FIT outcome in the past 6 months and are scheduled for a screening colonoscopy at one of the participating centers will be offered to participate in the study.
2. Following the informed consent process, subjects will undergo the Gixam test.

   1. A subset of 50 subjects will participate in the repeatability assessment. They will undergo three (3) repetitive Gixam tests one after the other, by the same operator.
   2. Both the subject and the endoscopist will be blinded to the Gixam outcome
3. All subjects will thereafter undergo a standard of care HD-WL colonoscopy procedure.
4. All resected and retrieved lesions will be sent separately for histopathological evaluation.
