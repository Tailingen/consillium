Umbrella Study for Single Patient Treatments in Oncology
The purpose of this study is to collect data on how advanced and rare cancers respond to biomarker-based treatments.
Advanced Cancer|Rare Diseases
OTHER: Patient-specific treatments
Overall response rate for the overall cohorts and the number of patients accessing precision targeted therapy, 3 years
Overall survival rate, 5 years|Progression-free survival rate, 5 years|Number of participants with adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, For Groups 1 and 2: Only Grade 3 and above AEs/AESIs and SAEs that are related (possibly, probably or definitely) to the study drug.

For Group 3: All SAEs (regardless of causality)., 5 years
The UNIQUE umbrella protocol is an overarching framework to study precision medicine in patients with precise molecular data, who have exhausted all established treatment options and who are not eligible for any of the ongoing trials. There is no additional visit or procedure required to participate in this study. Participants who have received/who may receive the following treatments may join the study and will be assigned to a study cohort (group):

* Group 1 - Health Canada approved/marketed drug(s) used on or off-label as Standard of Care (SOC)
* Group 2 - Drugs accessed from Special Access Program (SAP)
* Group 3 - Non-marketed investigational agents

Under the UNIQUE framework, data from participants will be evaluated. The following data will be collected:

* Demographic data (for example: sex, race, month and year of birth)
* Medical history
* Cancer characteristics including biomarkers
* Treatment history
* response to treatment
