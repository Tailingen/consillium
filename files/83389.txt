B-CD30 + Hodgkin Lymphoma International Multi-center Retrospective Study of Treatment Practices and Outcomes
The purpose of this study is to describe progression-free survival (PFS) in participants with relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (RRHL), defined as the time from initiation of first treatment for RRHL to first documentation of relapse or disease progression, or death.
Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma|Relapsed or Refractory Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma
Group 2, RRHL: Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as time from initiation of frontline regimen to first documentation of relapse or disease progression or death, censored at date of most recent follow-up/contact. Progressive disease (PD) was defined as any new lesion or increase by \>=50% of previously involved site from nadir, and was evaluated based on International Working Group (IWG) criteria (Cheson et al 2007). Median PFS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method., From initiation of first treatment until first documentation of relapse/PD/until date of death (or date when participant was last alive), whichever occurred first (observed retrospectively from 2010 until date of data collection [up to 9 years 10 months])
Group 1, cHL: Number of Participants Based on Clinical Staging According to Ann Arbor Staging at Diagnosis, The Ann Arbor staging system of lymphomas is used to summarize the extent of the cancer's spread. Stages are classified by Roman numerals I (lessspread) to IV (more spread). Additional sub staging variables include: A, asymptomatic; and B, presence of B symptoms (including fever, night sweats and weight loss of \>=10 percent \[%\] of body weight over 6 months)., Day 1 at cHL diagnosis|Group 2, RRHL: Number of Participants Based on Clinical Staging According to Ann Arbor Staging at Diagnosis, The Ann Arbor staging system of lymphomas is used to summarize the extent of the cancer's spread.

Stages are classified by Roman numerals I (less spread) to IV (more spread). Additional sub staging variables include: A, asymptomatic; and B, presence of B symptoms (including fever, night sweats and weight loss of \>=10% of body weight over 6 months)., At second, third, fourth, and fifth relapse (up to 9 years 10 months)|Group 1, cHL: Number of Participants Based on Each International Prognostic Score (IPS) Category, IPS score was calculated based on following factors: age \>=45 years, male sex, stage IV disease, albumin\<4 gram per liter (g/L), white blood cell (WBC)\>=15\*10\^9 per liter (/L), haemoglobin \<10.5 g/L, and lymphocyte count\<0.6\*10\^6/L or \<8% of differential. One point was assigned for each of above factors. The sum of points allotted correlates with following risk groups: good risk (0-1 points)-5 year survival of 89-90%; fair risk (2 to 3 points)-5 year survival of 78-81%; poor risk (4-7 points)-5 year survival of 56-61%. Total score range is 0 to 7, lower scores indicate higher survival rate., Day 1 at cHL diagnosis|Group 1, cHL: Number of Participants With B Symptoms at Diagnosis, The Ann Arbor staging system of lymphomas is used to summarize the extent of the cancer's spread.

B-symptoms indicate the presence of systemic symptoms. The presence or absence of B-symptoms has prognostic significance and is reflected in the staging of these lymphomas., Day 1 at cHL diagnosis|Group 2, RRHL: Number of Participants With B Symptoms at Diagnosis, The Ann Arbor staging system of lymphomas is used to summarize the extent of the cancer's spread.

This is a retrospective, non-interventional study of participants with newly-diagnosed cHL, or with RRHL. The study will review the medical records of participants to describe participant's demographics, disease characteristics, treatments received, outcomes, health resources used by the participants, and adverse events that are associated with treatments, and resources used for treatment.

The study will enroll approximately 50 to 100 participants in each group at each of the 13 participating countries. Based on the diagnosis of the disease, participants will be assigned to one of the following groups:

Group 1: cHL Group 2: RRHL

This multi-center trial will be conducted in Argentina, Australia, China, Colombia, Hong Kong, Mexico, Republic of Korea, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan, and Turkey. The data for Group 1 and Group 2 will be collected from date of cHL or RRHL diagnosis until the date of death (or the date when the participant was last known to be alive, whichever occurs first).
