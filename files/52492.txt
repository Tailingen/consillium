Metabolism of Lipids in Advanced Cancer
The causes of failing nutrition status in advanced cancer are not well known. The way fat is moved, stored, burned or changed into other compounds may be affected and will be followed in patients using a tracer and other blood tests. The investigators hypothesize that fat loss and wasting results from low essential fatty acid availability in the body. Changes may occur in the liver that limits distribution and availability of fat to the body as an energy source or for other essential functions.

Weight loss in cancer is the result of breakdown of fat (lipid) and muscle protein reserves. This research will explore how people with cancer use fat in their body through the use of tracers and measures in the blood. A stable isotope of hydrogen called 'deuterium' is used to trace the production of different fats by the liver. Other methods will determine how much and what types of fat are transported around the body. Body composition will be determined by CT scan and related to fat measures.
