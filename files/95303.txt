Clinical Trial of CNCT19 Cell Injection in the Treatment of Relapsed or Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
The study is a Phase II, single-arm, open-label, single-dose clinical trial, and its primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CNCT19 Cell Injection in the treatment of CD19 positive Relapsed or Refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

The study is a Phase II, single-arm, open-label, single-dose clinical trial, and its primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CNCT19 Cell Injection in the treatment of CD19 positive Relapsed or Refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The study consists of screening period (8 weeks), treatment period (4 weeks), and follow-up period (2 years at most).
