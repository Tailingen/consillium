A Pilot Study to Explore the Role of Gut Flora in Myasthenia Gravis
This study seeks to correlate microbiome sequencing data with information provided by patients and their medical records.
Myasthenia Gravis|Myasthenia Gravis, Generalized
OTHER: No intervention
Correlation of Microbiome to Disease via Relative Abundance Found in Microbiome Sequencing, Relative abundance of bacterial classes within taxonomic phyla and, more broadly, within their domain will be analyzed by sequencing the gut microbiome. These data will then be categorized with Myasthenia Gravis., Three years
The goal of this Research Study is to better understand how the genetic information in subject's microbiome correlates to Myasthenia Gravis.
