BAriatric Surgery Induced Chromosomal Change
The purpose of this study is to better understand the impact of weight-loss surgery on telomere length. Telomeres are a key marker of biological aging of cells. Telomere shortening is a natural process of aging. Several pathologies and lifestyles are associated with premature telomere shortening, such as obesity, diabetes mellitus or sedentary lifestyle. New evidence supports that telomere shortening can be partially reversed by lifestyle changes such as healthy diet, reduced stress, or increased physical activity.

This study aims to evaluate the impact of metabolic and bariatric surgery on telomere length as well as the role of type 2 diabetes resolution and oxidative stress improvement on telomere lengthening.

The investigators hypothesize that metabolic and bariatric surgery is associated with the lengthening of telomeres as a possible underlying mechanism of cancer risk reduction.

It is a prospective, single-center study including patients with obesity class II or more (Body Mass Index ≥ 35kg/m2) and patients having had metabolic and bariatric surgery more than 12 months ago.
