Safety and Efficacy of Marqibo in Metastatic Malignant Uveal Melanoma
Marqibo (liposomal vincristine) is a form of vincristine preparation. Vincristine is designed to interfere with the multiplication of cancer cells, which may slow or stop their growing and spreading throughout the body. This may cause the cancer cells to die. Liposomal vincristine is formed when vincristine is placed inside of oil droplets called liposomes, which may help to improve the delivery of drug to the tumor site. The liposomal formulation results in a slow, steady release of vincristine in the tumor metastasis, exposing the cancer cells to vincristine continuously.

The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if Marqibo (liposomal vincristine) can help to control metastatic uveal melanoma. The safety of liposomal vincristine will also be studied.

Approximately 50 patients will take part in this study.
