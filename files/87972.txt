Measuring the Quality of Surgical Care and Setting Benchmarks for Training Using Intuitive Data Recorder Technology
MASTERY is a multi-centre prospective cohort study involving patients undergoing robotic assisted surgery for prostate, colorectal, lung, gynaecological, hepatobiliary, and ear, nose \& throat tumours.

All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high score for the Sexual Activity and Sexual Functioning scales represents a high level of functioning, whereas a high score for the Urinary, Bowel, and Hormonal Treatment-Related symptoms scales and Incontinence Aid item represents a high level of symptomatology or problems., Baseline, day 30 and day 90 after surgery
MASTERY will create a data collection platform to capture, annotate and analyse digital point of care data relating to surgeon's performance during live surgery. This is a multi-centre prospective cohort study involving patients undergoing robotic assisted surgery for prostate, colorectal, lung, gynaecological, hepatobiliary, and ear, nose \& throat tumours. In this study, automated digital point of care data relating to the surgeons' performance will be collected via the Intuitive Data Recorder (IDR) device (Intuitive Surgical Inc, USA). Data collection will also encompass surgeon characteristics, patient characteristics, 30-day clinical outcomes including surgical complications, reoperation, length of stay and hospital readmission. This will also include collection of baseline, 30- and 90-day patient reported outcomes data.

MASTERY is the first study of the RCS Robotics Working Group and aims to initially recruit 500 patients across 13 centres in United Kingdom from January 2021.
