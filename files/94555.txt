PTK787/ZK222584 With Bevacizumab in Patients With Refractory and/or Advanced Malignancies
PTK787/ZK222584 is an orally active inhibitor of VEGF-R tyrosine kinases. Bevacizumab is an intravenous humanized monoclonal antibody directed against vascular endothelial growth factor. By binding to VEGF, bevacizumab blocks VEGF-A receptor binding. Due to the different mechanisms of action and the non-overlapping toxicity profiles of the two agents, it is hoped that a combination regimen incorporating both compounds will produce increased activity without enhanced toxicity.
