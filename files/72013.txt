A Prospective, Multicenter, Multicohort Phase II Study: Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of Preoperative Neoadjuvant Treatment With a PD-1 Inhibitor in Combination With Chemotherapy in Locally Advanced Laryngeal and Hypopharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) refers to a series of tumors that occur in the head and neck region, including the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, thyroid gland, and salivary glands. Malignant tumors of the head and neck account for approximately 19.9% to 30.2% of all tumors in the body, ranking sixth in incidence among all malignant tumors, with over 90% being squamous cell carcinoma in terms of pathological type. The treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is primarily surgical. Early-stage cases can achieve a cure through simple surgical resection or radiotherapy. For locally advanced and late-stage cases, a combination of surgery with radiotherapy or chemotherapy can yield satisfactory therapeutic effects. However, most patients with head and neck tumors present at a locally advanced (Stage III to IVB) or late stage, possibly having lost the opportunity for surgery and can only opt for a comprehensive treatment mainly based on radiochemotherapy. Current data show that with standard treatment, the 5-year survival rates for patients with early-stage, locally advanced, and metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma are 80%, 50%, and 25%, respectively. Fifty to sixty percent of newly diagnosed subjects cannot be cured and experience recurrence or metastasis within 3 years. For patients with recurrent or metastatic disease after first-line treatment failure, the median survival time with chemotherapy is only 6 to 9 months, with a 1-year survival rate of 5% to 33% and a 5-year survival rate of merely 3.6%. Laryngeal cancer and hypopharyngeal cancer hold unique significance among head and neck tumors because they not only threaten patients' lives but can also significantly affect their quality of life, particularly the preservation of laryngeal function. Laryngeal function includes voice production, swallowing, and breathing, and the loss of these functions can lead to a severe decline in quality of life. Traditionally, surgical resection has been the main treatment for these cancers, but total laryngectomy can result in permanent voice loss and significant psychological and social impacts. Therefore, how to effectively control the tumor while preserving laryngeal function has become an important goal of treatment.

PD-L1 is a key negative regulator of self-reactive T cells and plays a role in maintaining peripheral immune tolerance and suppressing autoimmunity in various ways, leading to T cell exhaustion and dysfunction, and allowing tumor cells to evade immune surveillance. PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies restore the function of tumor-specific T cells by blocking the binding of PD-1 to PD-L1, thereby enhancing antitumor immunity and are now used to treat a variety of tumors. The efficacy of PD-1 inhibitors as neoadjuvant therapy in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is not yet clear. However, given the good therapeutic effects of immunotherapy in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, induction therapy with PD-1 inhibitors is considered to have promising clinical application prospects.

In summary, we hypothesize that compared with the traditional TPF (docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil) neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen, a PD-1 inhibitor combined with chemotherapy regimen may be safer and more effective and easier to apply in clinical practice. At present, there are no reports of studies on the use of PD-1 inhibitors combined with chemotherapy regimens for locally advanced, resectable head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients, either domestically or internationally. We plan to investigate the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant treatment with PD-1 inhibitors combined with chemotherapy for resectable head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients in China, to provide a basis for future neoadjuvant treatment regimens.
