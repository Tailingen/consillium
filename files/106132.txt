MicroRNAs From Blood Samples as Biomarkers for Gastric Cancer Detection
The goal of this observational study is to compare specific microRNA levels from the plasma of gastric cancer patients and healthy volunteers to see if there is an upregulated expression in gastric cancer patients.

The main question it aims to answer is:

- Can microRNAs be effectively used as diagnostic biomarkers for gastric cancer?

Participants will be asked for their consent to obtain 5 cc of blood.
