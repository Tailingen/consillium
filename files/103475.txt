A Study to Learn About the Effects of the Combination of Elranatamab (PF-06863135) and Iberdomide in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma (MagnetisMM-30)
The main purpose of the study is to understand how safe and tolerable is elranatamab when given along with iberdomide.

There are 2 parts to this study. Part 1 will look at how safe and tolerable is elranatamab when given with iberdomide. Part 2 will look at the correct amount of this combination that can be given to patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

Myeloma is a type of cancer that begins in plasma cells (white blood cells that produce antibodies). Refractory means a disease or condition that does not respond to treatment. Relapsed means the return of a disease after a period of improvement.

All study medicines are given in cycles that last 28 days. Everyone taking part in this study will receive elranatamab as a shot under the skin. Iberdomide will be taken by mouth once a day for 21 days over a 28-day cycle.

Participants will receive study medicine until:

* their disease progresses or,
* they experience unacceptable side effects or,
* they choose to no longer take part in the study.

The study will look at the experiences of people receiving the study medicines. This will help see if the study medicines are safe and can be used for multiple myeloma treatment.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Elranatamab|DRUG: Iberdomide
Part 1: Number of participants with dose limiting toxicity (DLT), Dose limiting toxicity rate based on dose limiting toxicity evaluable participants, Cycle 1, about 28 days|Part 2: Number of participants with Adverse Events (AE) by Seriousness and Relationship to Treatment, Number of participants with AE among participants who take at least 1 dose of study intervention. AEs are categorized by seriousness and relationship to treatment. Relatedness to study drug is assessed by investigator., Assessed from baseline up to 90 days after last dose of study treatment
Part 1: Number of participants with Adverse Events (AE) by Seriousness and Relationship to Treatment, Number of participants with AE among participants who take at least 1 dose of study intervention. AEs are categorized by seriousness and relationship to treatment. Relatedness to study drug is assessed by investigator., Assessed from baseline up to 90 days after last dose of study treatment|Part 1 and Part 2: Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AE) characterized by type, frequency, severity, An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibly of causal relationship, Assessed from baseline up to 90 days after last dose of study treatment|Part 1 and Part 2: Number of Participants with Clinically Significant Change from Baseline in Laboratory Abnormalities, Laboratory abnormalities as characterized by type, frequency, severity, Assessed from baseline up to 90 days after last dose of study treatment|Part 1 and Part 2: Percentage of Participants with Objective Response Rate (ORR), Percent of participants having confirmed Stringent Complete Response (sCR), Complete Response (CR), Very Good Partial Response (VGPR), or Partial Response (PR) per IMWG criteria as determined by investigator, Assessed for approximately 2 years|Part 1 and Part 2: Percentage of Participants with Complete Response Rate (CRR), Percent of participants having Complete Response/ Stringent Complete Response (CR+sCR) per IMWG criteria as determined by investigator, Assessed for approximately 2 years|Part 1 and Part 2: Time to Response (TTR), For participants with an objective response per IMWG criteria, TTR is the time from first dose to the first documentation of objective response that is subsequently confirmed, Assessed for approximately 2 years|Part 1 and Part 2: Duration of Response (DOR), For participants with an objective response per IMWG criteria, DOR is the time from first documentation of objective response that is subsequently confirmed until the first documentation of confirmed progressive disease (PD) per IMWG criteria, Assessed for approximately 2 years|Part 1 and Part 2: Duration of Complete Response (DOCR), For participants with a Complete Response/ Stringent Complete Response (CR+sCR) per IMWG criteria, DOCR is the time from the first documentation of CR/sCR that is subsequently confirmed until the first documentation of confirmed progressive disease (PD) per IMWG criteria, Assessed for approximately 2 years|Part 1 and Part 2: Time of Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression free survival (IMWG criteria), Assessed for approximately 2 years|Part 1 and Part 2: Time of Overall Survival (OS), The duration of time from first dose of study treatment to death, Assessed for approximately 2 years|Part 1 and Part 2: Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Negativity Rate, The proportion of participants achieving CR+sCR with negative MRD per IMWG sequencing criteria, from the date of first dose until the first documentation of confirmed progressive disease (PD), death, or start of new anticancer therapy., Assessed for approximately 2 years|Part 1 and Part 2: Concentrations of elranatamab, Pre-dose and post-dose concentrations of elranatamab, Assessed for approximately 2 years|Part 1 and Part 2: Concentrations of iberdomide, Pre-dose concentrations of iberdomide, Assessed for approximately 4 months|Part 1 and Part 2: Percentage of participants with positive anti-drug antibodies (ADA) against elranatamab, Percent of participants with positive ADA to elranatamab when given in combination with iberdomide, Assessed for approximately 2 years
