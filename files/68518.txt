A Phase 2 Study With MIP-1404 in Men With High-Risk PC Scheduled for RP and EPLND Compared to Histopathology
This was a multicenter, multi-reader, open-label, Phase 2 study assessing the safety and performance characteristics of MIP 1404 imaging in the detection of prostate gland and pelvic lymph node cancer. Comparative performance characteristics between MIP 1404 imaging and MRI were also assessed, as judged by histopathology results.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Drug: 99mTc-MIP-1404
Assess the Ability of 99mTc-MIP-1404 to Detect Prostate Cancer Within the Prostate Gland., For the prostate gland, sensitivity values refer to the number of subjects in the study, i.e., the percentages of true positive subjects correctly identified by the imaging technique. Pathology results were used as the truth standard for all imaging analyses., Within 3-6 hours of dosing SPECT/CT images will be taken
Assess the Ability of MIP-1404 to Detect Metastatic Prostate Cancer Within Pelvic Lymph Nodes, For lymph nodes, sensitivity values refer to the number of subjects in the study, i.e., the percentages of true positive subjects correctly identified by the imaging technique. Pathology results were used as the truth standard for all imaging analyses., Within 3-6 hours of dosing SPECT/CT images will be taken|Assess the Ability of MIP-1404 to Detect the Extent and Location of Prostate Cancer Within the Prostate Gland, For specific segments of the prostate, a sensitivity value refers to the number of evaluable segments (histologically examined "tissue-segments") from all subjects, i.e., the percentages of true positive segments correctly identified by the imaging technique., Within 3-6 hours of dosing SPECT/CT images will be taken|Assess the Ability of MIP-1404 to Detect the Specific Location of Metastatic Prostate Cancer Within Anatomic Pelvic Lymph Node Regions, For specific segments of the lymph nodes, a sensitivity value refers to the number of evaluable segments (histologically examined "tissue-segments") from all subjects, i.e., the percentages of true positive segments correctly identified by the imaging technique., Within 3-6 hours of dosing SPECT/CT images will be taken|Assess the Comparative Performance of MIP-1404 Against MRI for Detection of Prostate Cancer Within the Prostate Gland., Comparative performance characteristics between MIP-1404 imaging and MRI were analyzed for the prostate gland.

This is a single arm, open label study of approximately 100 high-risk prostate cancer patients scheduled for prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymph node dissection. Patients receive a single IV dose of 99mTc-MIP-1404 (study drug) followed by SPECT/CT scan 3-6 hours after injection. As standard of care, patients will undergo prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymph node dissection (EPLND) within three weeks of study drug dosing. 99mTc-MIP-1404 image data will be evaluated for visible uptake and compared with histopathology.
