A Study on the Impact of Intelligent Nutrition Management on Clinical Outcomes in Chemotherapy Patients With Gastrointestinal Malignancies
An increasing body of evidence suggests that nutritional status is a key factor in determining the quality of life of cancer patients. The sensitivity of cancer patients to anti-tumor treatments, the occurrence of side effects, and their quality of life are closely related to their nutritional status. Data show that about 50% of cancer patients experience a weight loss of more than 10% at the time of diagnosis and treatment, and once patients enter a cachexia state, the weight loss becomes difficult to reverse. Therefore, the extent to which nutritional interventions can impact clinical outcomes in these patients needs to be answered through clinical research. Currently, there are few studies using randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to explore how nutritional interventions can improve patients' quality of life, particularly in terms of prolonging survival. A recent RCT in a smaller sample population found that long-term, intensive, individualized nutritional counseling and support not only improved malnutrition in cancer patients, reduced treatment complications, and enhanced quality of life but also significantly extended survival time.

This study is a prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial aimed at investigating the effect of full-scale intelligent nutrition management in gastrointestinal malignancy patients (esophageal cancer, gastric cancer) undergoing chemotherapy. The study attempts to confirm that full-scale intelligent nutrition management can benefit these patients by maintaining or improving their nutritional status, and that the clinical effectiveness of intelligent nutrition management is comparable to that of professional nutritionists. This research will also provide clinical evidence for the intelligent and standardized nutritional treatment of cancer patients during the chemotherapy period.
