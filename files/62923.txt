To Identify Potential New Urine Marker Panel for Cancer Screening
Polyamines are naturally produced metabolites in our cells. There were some reports suggested the urinary levels of polyamines were altered in patients with different cancers. This study is to explore the use of urinary polyamine for the diagnosis of common cancers.

The sensitivity and specificity of cancer detection by urine polyamines, Urine samples will be prepared and analyzed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (UPLC-MS/MS). Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve for overall and individual cancer diagnosis will be performed.pathological result will be assessed., 1 month after surgery
Urine tests is a simple, non-invasive approach for cancer detection. One example of such cancer biomarkers are natural polyamines. Recently, there are also other reports on the use of polyamines in diagnosis of other cancers. In this larger scale study, with inclusion of subjects with different cancer types, to further assess the correlation urine polyamines and other urine metabolite markers for the diagnosis of different cancer types and investigate their role as a potential non-invasive marker for cancer detection and monitoring.
