A Study Evaluating the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Escalating Doses of Forimtamig in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma (r/r MM)
This is a first-in-human, open-label, uncontrolled, multi-center, monotherapy, dose-escalation and dose expansion study. Forimtamig will be administered to participants with r/r MM for whom no standard-of-care treatment exists or who are intolerant to those established therapies. The study consists of two parts: dose-escalation of forimtamig (Part 1) and a randomized dose expansion of forimtamig (Part 2).
