KN026 Combined With KN046 in Subjects With HER2 Positive Solid Tumor
This is a phase Ib, open-label, dose-escalation and expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor activity of KN026 combined with KN046 in subjects with advanced HER2 positive solid tumors.
HER2 Positive Solid Tumor
BIOLOGICAL: KN026 combined with KN046
Dose-limiting toxicity（DLT）, Dose-limiting toxicity, 28 days|Objective response rate (ORR), Objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1 criteria according to investigators assessment, up to 2 years|Duration of response (DOR), Duration of response (DOR) per RECIST 1.1 criteria according to investigators assessment, up to 2 years
Clinical benefit rate, Clinical benefit rate, up to 2 years|Progression free survival (PFS) rates, Progression free survival (PFS) rates, 6 months and 12 months|Overall survival (OS) rates, Overall survival (OS) rates, 6 months and 12 months
The study is composed of 2 stages. Stage 1 consists of dose escalation cohorts for determining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Part 2 consists of 4 tumor type expansion cohorts for expanding the information on clinical safety, clinical pharmacokinetics and antitumor activity in HER2 positive patients.
