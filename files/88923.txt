The Safety and Effectiveness of rhTSH in Radioiodine Treatment for Patients With Differentiated Thyroid Cancer.
This is a randomized, open, parallel controlled, multi-center clinical trial; 120 subjects were randomly assigned to the test group and the control group according to 3:1.
Differentiated Thyroid Cancer
DRUG: Recombinant Human Thyroid Stimulating Hormone for Injection(rhTSH)|OTHER: radioactive iodine
Ablation success rate by Diagnostic Whole Body Scan (DxWBS), In the THW state (TSH≥30mU/L), DxWBS showed the proportion of subjects who did not see radioactive iodine uptake in the thyroid gland., at week 36
Serum thyroglobulin (Tg) levels, In the THW state (TSH≥30mU/L), the proportion of patients with Tg levels \<1ng/mL and neck B-ultrasound negative during rhTSH stimulation accounted for all subjects., at week 36|Adverse Event, Classification and degree of adverse events, up to week 40 ± 7 day
This study was conducted in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer who had undergone near-total thyroidectomy. After surgery patients were randomized to one of two methods of performing thyroid remnant ablation (use of radioiodine to remove any remaining thyroid tissue). One group of patients who took thyroid hormone medicine and were euthyroid \[i.e. their thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels are normal\], and received injections of Thyrogen (0.9 mg daily on two consecutive days) followed by oral radioiodine. The second group of patients did not take thyroid hormone medicine so that they were hypothyroid (i.e. their TSH levels were high), and were given oral radioiodine. All patients received the same amount of radioactive iodine (30mCi±1.5mCi or 1.11GBq of 131I). Approximately 9 months later, whole body scans were performed on all patients to learn whether the thyroid remnants had been successfully ablated.
