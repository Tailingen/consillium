A Study of Bevacizumab Therapy in Patients With Newly Diagnosed High-Grade Gliomas and Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Gliomas
The outcome for children with high-grade gliomas and diffuse intrinsic brainstem gliomas remains poor despite the use of multi-modal therapy with surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy.

DRUG: Temozolomide|DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Irinotecan
To determine the toxicities and feasibility of the proposed treatment regimen in patients with high-grade glioma and diffuse intrinsic brainstem glioma, 2-3 years
To determine 1-year EFS, median PFS and median OS in newly diagnosed patients with high-grade glioma treated with radiotherapy and concurrent temozolomide, bevacizumab followed by bevacizumab, irinotecan and temozolomide for 12 courses, 2-3 years|To determine the 1-year EFS, median PFS and median OS in newly diagnosed patients with diffuse intrinsic brainstem glioma treated with radiotherapy and concurrent bevacizumab followed by bevacizumab and irinotecan for 12 courses, 2-3 years|To estimate blood levels of VEGF in circulating endothelial cells in patients at different time points, 2-3 years|To document changes in MR perfusion and diffusion within 24-48 hours after the 2nd dose of bevacizumab during radiotherapy, 2-3 years|To correlate functional changes in tumor with responses to treatment using MR diffusion/perfusion imaging, 2-3 years|To correlate the results of the biology studies in serum or tumor with PFS, 2-3 years|To conduct gene expression profiling, CGH and SNP arrays in patients with high-grade gliomas, 2-3 years|To assess telomerase activity, hTert expression, and telomere length in patients with high-grade gliomas, 2-3 years|To assess the health-related quality of life of patients by parent report, and when possible, patient report at key points in therapy, 2-3 years|To assess functional abilities and level of independence of patients during and following treatment, 2-3 years
Novel therapies are needed to improve the outcome of these children. Recent studies have demonstrated very promising results of treatment with bevacizumab/irinotecan in patients with recurrent high grade gliomas. Based on these promising results, and the tolerability of the irinotecan and bevacizumab in children with recurrent CNS malignancies both anecdotally and in a study conducted by the Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium, we have designed a novel study incorporating concurrent radiation therapy with bevacizumab ± temozolomide followed by bevacizumab, irinotecan ±temozolomide in patients with newly diagnosed high-grade gliomas and diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas.
