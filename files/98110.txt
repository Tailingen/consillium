Study of Mirvetuximab Soravtansine in Combination With Bevacizumab, Carboplatin, Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin, Pembrolizumab, or Bevacizumab + Carboplatin in Participants With Folate Receptor Alpha (FRα) Positive Advanced Epithelial Ovarian Cancer, Primary Peritoneal, or Fallopian Tube Cancer
This study comprises a Dose Escalation phase followed by a Dose Expansion phase. Dose Escalation part of the study will assess the safety and tolerability and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) as the recommended Phase 2 (RP2D) dose for each regimen. Participants will be assigned to one of the 4 regimens in Dose Escalation phase: Regimen A: mirvetuximab soravtansine administered with bevacizumab; Regimen B: mirvetuximab soravtansine administered with carboplatin; Regimen C: mirvetuximab soravtansine administered with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin; or Regimen D: mirvetuximab soravtansine administered with pembrolizumab. Dose Expansion of the study will further assess safety, tolerability and preliminary anti-tumor activity of mirvetuximab soravtansine. A Dose Expansion phase is planned for Regimen A and Regimen D and will open pending Sponsor decision; participants enrolled in the Dose Expansion phase will receive study treatment at the MTD or RP2D determined during Dose Escalation. For Regimen A, participants in the Dose Expansion phase may be enrolled according to prior exposure to bevacizumab into 3 Dose Expansion Cohorts as follows: 1) Dose Expansion Cohort 1: bevacizumab naïve; 2) Dose Expansion Cohort 2: bevacizumab pretreated; and 3) Dose Expansion Cohort 3: one to three prior treatments, one of which could have been bevacizumab. A triplet Regimen (Regimen E: mirvetuximab soravtansine + bevacizumab + carboplatin) will be opened to evaluate the safety and tolerability and to assess any early signs of activity in participants dosed with the combination regimen. All mirvetuximab soravtansine doses were calculated according to adjusted ideal body weight.

Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Adverse events (AEs) were any noxious, pathologic, or unintended change in anatomical, physiologic, or metabolic function that developed or worsened during the clinical study, not necessarily having a causal relationship to study drug. Severity was graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03: Grade 1=mild, Grade 2=moderate, Grade 3=severe, Grade 4=life-threatening, Grade 5=death. Serious AEs included death, a life-threatening AE, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or an important medical event that jeopardized the participant and required medical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes previously listed. TEAEs were any AE that emerged on or after the first dose, and within 30 days of the last dose. Serious and other non-serious AEs regardless of causality are reported in the AE module., From first dose of study drug up to 30 days after last dose of study drug (maximum exposure: 238.3 weeks)|Dose Expansion (Regimens A and D) and Triplet (Regimen E): Objective Response Rate (ORR); Percentage of Participants With Confirmed Response, as Assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1, ORR was defined as percentage of participants with confirmed response (complete response \[CR\] + partial response \[PR\]). CR: Disappearance of all target or non-target lesions. All pathological or non-pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to less than (\<) 10 millimeters (mm). PR: At least 30 percent (%) decrease in the sum of the longest diameters (SLD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline SLD. The 95% confidence interval (CI) was based on binomial distribution., From first dose of study drug until first CR or PR (maximum exposure: 238.3 weeks)
Dose Escalation (Regimens A Through D): ORR; Percentage of Participants With Confirmed Response, as Assessed by RECIST Version 1.1, ORR was defined as percentage of participants with confirmed response (CR + PR). CR: Disappearance of all target or non-target lesions. All pathological or non-pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. PR: At least 30% decrease in the SLD of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline SLD., From first dose of study drug until first CR or PR (maximum exposure: 238.3 weeks)|Progression-Free Survival (PFS); Time From the Date Of First Dose Until The Date Of Progressive Disease (PD) Or Death By Any Cause, As Defined By RECIST Version 1.1, PFS was defined as the time from the date of the first dose of study drug until the date of PD or death from any cause, whichever occurred first, estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. PFS was defined based on radiological assessments and determined by the investigator. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the SLD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest (nadir) SLD since and including baseline. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the SLD must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. Unequivocal progression of non-target lesions and appearance of new lesions. Unequivocal progression should not normally trump target lesion status. It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase., From first dose of study drug until the date of PD or death by any cause (maximum exposure: 238.3 weeks)|Duration of Response (DOR) Per RECIST v1.1 by Investigator Assessment, DOR was defined as the time from the date of the first response (CR or PR), to the date of PD or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. DOR was only defined for patients who had a best overall response of CR or PR, estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The response-evaluable population included all patients with radiographic assessment at baseline, who received at least 1 dose of combination treatment and had at least 1 post-dose radiographic tumor assessment or who died within 105 days of first dose., From the date of first objective response to the time of PD (maximum exposure: 238.3 weeks)|Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup (GCIG) Cancer Antigen (CA)-125 Clinical Response Rate by Investigator Assessment, A CA-125 response was defined as a ≥ 50% reduction in CA-125 levels from baseline. GCIG CA125 response rate was defined as the number of participants with a CA-125 confirmed response divided by the number of participants in the CA-125 response-evaluable population multiplied by 100. The CA-125 evaluable population included all participants whose pretreatment sample was ≥2.0 times the upper limit of normal, within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of combination treatment, and who had at least 1 post-baseline CA-125 evaluation., From first dose of study drug until first CR or PR (maximum exposure: 238.3 weeks)|Pharmacokinetics (PK) Parameter: Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of Mirvetuximab Soravtansine and Total Antibody, Blood samples from participants were analyzed to characterize the PK of mirvetuximab soravtansine when administered in 3- or 4-week cycles.
