Etoposide Plus Lobaplatin Versus Etoposide Plus Cisplatin for Patients With Limited Small-cell Lung Cancer
This randomized phase II study compare survival outcomes and toxicity of two chemotherapy regimens (etoposide plus lobaplatin or etoposide plus cisplatin) in combination with concurrent thoracic radiation therapy (TRT) for limited stage small cell lung cancer.
Small-cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: etoposide plus lobaplatin|DRUG: etoposide plus cisplatin
Progression-free survival(PFS), PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first., up to 12 months
Overall survival(OS), Overall survival is defined as the time interval from date of diagnosis to date of death from any cause, up to 24 months|Treatment toxicities, To assess and record nausea, vomiting, hematologic toxicity,radiation oesophagitis and other treantment complications by CTCAE v4.0, up to 12 months
Lobaplatin is a platinum complex with DNA alkylating activity that was developed by ASTA Medica (Degussa) for the treatment of cancer. Lobaplatin as the third-generation platinum antineoplastic agent, showed promising antineoplastic effects in variety of preclinical test tumor models. A randomized, multicenter phase III study showed that Lobaplatin plus etoposide (EL) regimen is not inferiority to cisplatin plus etoposide (EP) regimen in terms of PFS, the tolerance and QOL with EL regimen are better than that with EP regimen. Thus, we perform this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of EL and EP regimens concurrently with thoracic radiotherapy in patients with limited-stage SCLC.
