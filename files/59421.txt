Breast Implant-associated Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (BIA-ALCL) Registry
Anaplastic large cell lymphoma associated with breast implants (BIA-ALCL) is a rare disease seen only in women with a breast implant.

Because of the low incidence of this disease and the peculiar histological subtype, French authorities, in accordance with the recommendations of an expert group, recommended the implementation of a BIA-ALCL case registry, in connection with a national Multidisciplinary meeting (Réunion de Concertation Pluridisciplinaire nationale de recours- RCP).

This registry is opened in France and in Belgium
