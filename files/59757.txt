Comparison of Pain After Uterine Artery Embolization Using Gelatin Microsphere or Tris-acryl Gelatin Microsphere
This study is a prospective and randomized investigation planned to compare pain after uterine artery embolization using Gelatin microsphere or tris-acryl gelatin microsphere in 60 patients with symptomatic fibroids.
Uterine Myoma|Uterine Fibroid
DEVICE: Gelatin microsphere (Nexsphereâ„¢)|DEVICE: Embosphere
Pain intensity by numerical rating scale, 0-10 numerical rating scale (0, no pain at all; 10, worst pain imaginable, 0-24 hours after embolization
Fentanyl and analgesic usage volume, Fentanyl and analgesic usage volume within 24 hours after embolization, 24 hours|Symptom severity score, Comparison of symptom severity score before and 3 months after embolization

Symptom was scored on a scale of 0-10, with 0 being no symptoms and 10 being the baseline, or initial symptoms., 3 months|Postoperative inflammation, Comparison of level or counts of C-Reactive Protein (CRP), leukocyte, neutrophil before and after embolization, 24 hours|Tumor necrosis degree, Assessment of tumor necrosis degree in MR after embolization, 3 months|Fluoroscopy and procedure time, Fluoroscopy and procedure time taken for embolization to achieved, procedure time|Serum Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH), Residual ovarian function before and after embolization, 3 months
This investigational study is designed to compare pain after uterine artery embolization using Gelatin microsphere or tris-acryl gelatin microsphere in patients with symptomatic fibroids.

The primary end-points will be evaluated by assessing the maximum Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score obtained for each time points within 24 hours after embolization.

Secondary end-points consist of evaluating six items: 1) fentanyl and analgesic usage within 24 hours, 2) comparison of symptom severity score and health-related quality of life score, 3) comparison of postoperative inflammation, 4) assessment of tumor necrosis degree in Magnetic Resonance Imaging, 5) fluoroscopy and procedure time comparison, and 6) assessment of residual ovarian function before and after surgery (Serum AMH).

This study included patients between the ages of 20 and less than 60 years of age who were diagnosed with uterine myoma and planned to undergo uterine artery embolization.
