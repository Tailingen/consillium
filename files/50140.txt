A Clinical Study of Albumin-bound Paclitaxel/Granulocyte-based Therapy for Recurrent/Metastatic Breast Cancer
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if Albumin-bound Paclitaxel/Granulocyte drug can treat patients with recurrent/metastatic breast cancer. The main questions it aims to answer are:

To verify the safety of Albumin-bound Paclitaxel/Granulocyte drug in patients with recurrent/metastatic breast cancer.

To evaluate the efficacy of Albumin-bound Paclitaxel/Granulocyte drug in patients with recurrent/metastatic breast cancer.

To detect the pharmacokinetic behavior of Albumin-bound Paclitaxel/Granulocyte drug in patients with recurrent/metastatic breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Albumin paclitaxel/neutrophil drug
To verity the safety of Albumin-bound Paclitaxel/Granulocyte in the treatment of Recurrent/Metastatic Breast Cancer, The adverse events and severe adverse events will be evaluated., 13 months
To evaluate the efficiency of Albumin-bound Paclitaxel/Granulocyte drug in the treatment of Recurrent/Metastatic Breast Cancer, The objective clinical response will be evaluated., 13 months
In this open, single-armed study, selected patients with recurrent/metastatic breast cancer confirmed by Histopathology will be received Albumin-bound Paclitaxel/Granulocyte-based therapy. The granulocyte will be separated by blood cell separator, and will be cultured in the GMP laboratory to make Albumin-bound Paclitaxel/Granulocyte drug. Then the drug will be infused intravenous into patients.
