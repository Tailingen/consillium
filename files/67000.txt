AlloStim速 Immunotherapy Dosing Alone or in Combination With Cryoablation in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
This is a single center, open label dose frequency escalation study of CryoVax速. personalized anti-tumor vaccine protocol combining the cryoablation of a selected metastatic lesion with intra-lesional immunotherapy with AlloStim速. The in-situ (in the body) cancer vaccine step combines killing a single metastatic tumor lesion by use of cryoablation in order to cause the release of tumor-specific markers to the immune system and then injecting bioengineered allogeneic immune cells (AlloStim速) into the lesion as an adjuvant in order to modulate the immune response and educate the immune system to kill other tumor cells where ever they reside in the body.
Colorectal Cancer Metastatic
BIOLOGICAL: AlloStim|PROCEDURE: Cryoablation
Evaluate the Overall Survival, Subjects are followed for survival monthly after completion of dosing, from time of signing informed consent for up to 18 months or until death
Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks as the third most common cancer worldwide. Metastasis is the main reason of death in CRC patients. The current drugs used to treat colorectal cancer provide important treatment options for patients, their limitations including drug resistance, poor efficacy and severe side effects. Development of new therapeutic strategies for KRAS mutant as well as BRAF mutant tumors are therefore highly needed in order to offer a new category of drug (immunotherapy). This study targets the population of mCRC patients that have progressed after two lines of chemotherapy and are not eligible for targeted therapies.
