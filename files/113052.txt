Patients At Risk for Sensory Screening (HPARSS) to Enhance Sensory Deficit Screening in Childhood Cancer Survivors
The overall goal of this study is to attempt to overcome the organizational barriers that impede prompt screening for at-risk sensory deficits in childhood cancer survivors (CCS). Using a cross sectional design study, collaborators in the Informatics Research branch of the Institute of Informatics at the Washington University School of Medicine will identify CCS at risk for sensory deficits based upon their therapy exposure to generate the highlighting patients at risk for sensory screening (HPARSS) document. The investigators will utilize the HPARSS that will link therapy related risks for sensory deficits to specific screening procedures prompting the primary oncology provider to implement screening, diagnostic testing, and therapy.
