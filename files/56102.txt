A Study of BDTX-4933 in Patients With KRAS, BRAF and Select RAS/MAPK Mutation-Positive Cancers
BDTX-4933-101 is a first-in-human, open-label, Phase 1 dose escalation and an expansion cohort study designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability, maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the preliminary recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), and antitumor activity of BDTX-4933. The study population for the Dose Escalation part of the study comprises adults with recurrent advanced/metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring KRAS non-G12C mutations, BRAF, or CRAF (RAF1) mutations, advanced/metastatic melanoma harboring BRAF or NRAS mutations, histiocytic neoplasms harboring BRAF, CRAF, or NRAS mutations, and other solid tumors harboring BRAF mutations. The study population for the Dose Expansion part of the study comprises adults with recurrent advanced/metastatic NSCLC harboring KRAS non-G12C mutations. All patients will self-administer BDTX-4933 orally in 28-day cycles until disease progression, toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or termination of the study.
