Study subjects: Patients diagnosed with Gastric - type Endocervical Adenocarcinoma were identified using the SEER database and SEER\*Stat 8.4.2 software. The search scope was the "SEER Research Plus Data, 17 Registries, Nov 2021 sub (2000 - 2019)" database, and the screening criteria included "Site and Morphology, Analytic Behavior Recode = Malignant" and "Site and Morphology, ICD - O - 3 / WHO 2008 Recode Site = Cervix". Patients with cervical Gastric - type Endocervical Adenocarcinoma were selected from the database.

Outcome measures: Overall survival (OS): The time from diagnosis to death of the patient.
