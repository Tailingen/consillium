Correlation Between Gut Microbiota and Radiosensitivity of Rectal Cancer
The purpose of this process is to clarify the characteristics of gut microbiota changes in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer undergoing preoperative neoadjuvant treatment, and to identify key bacterial species closely related to sensitivity to radiotherapy. This aims to elucidate the mechanism linking gut microbiome dysbiosis with radiotherapy sensitivity, thereby providing new combined treatment strategies to enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy.
Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer
OTHER: No intervention
Diameter of tumor, The tumor diameter before and after radiotherapy and the reduced tumor diameter after treatment were calculated, 30 days
Change in Gut Microbiota Composition, Change in gut microbiota composition, including alterations in bacterial taxa, diversity, and abundance, between rectal cancer patients sensitive to radiotherapy and a control group of patients insensitive to radiotherapy., 30 days|Change in Plasma metabolites, Metabolomics sequencing, including profiling of metabolites and their differences, was performed on patients' plasma before radiotherapy., 30 days
Five-year survival rate, 5 year
The study is expected to enroll 100 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer, including 50 patients in the radiotherapy-sensitive group and 50 in the radiotherapy-resistant group. Each participant will provide stool and blood samples before treatment for subsequent metagenomic and metabolomic sequencing analysis.
