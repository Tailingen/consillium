Exploratory Platform Research on Precision Therapy of Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
The study is being conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of ADC drugs monotherapy or combination therapy with HRS-4642 in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer.

This study is an open, single center, exploratory clinical trial aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of ADC drugs monotherapy or combination therapy with HRS-4642 in the treatment of patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer.

This study experiment is divided into two stages: dose exploration stage and efficacy exploration stage. During the dose exploration phase, RP2D was determined based on the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy data of ADC drugs monotherapy or combination therapy with HRS-4642, and then entered the efficacy exploration phase.
