Sintilimab Combined With Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy in Newly Diagnosed Metastatic Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma: A Multicenter Study
To explore the progression-free survival rate (progression-free survival, PFS), overall survival (OS), objective response rate(objective response rate, ORR) and safety of patients with Sintilimab + GP chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy for newly diagnosed metastatic NPC.
