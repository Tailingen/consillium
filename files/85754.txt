Study of Cord Blood-derived CAR NK Cells Targeting CD19/CD70 in Refractory/Relapsed B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
To find the highest tolerable dose of dualCAR-NK19/70 (a type of cell therapy) that can be given to patients who have B-cell lymphoma that is relapsed or refractory.
Refractory or Relapsed B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma

Incidence of Adverse Events, Type, frequency, and severity of adverse events,Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5, through study completion; an average of 1 year,up to 3 years|Exploratory Objectives, The exploratory objectives are to assess the cellular kinetics and pharmacodynamic effects of dualCAR-NK19/70 and to evaluate biomarkers associated with response, resistance, and toxicity after administration of dualCAR-NK19/70 in blood and tumor samples., Up to 3 years
Primary Objectives:

--The primary objective is to determine the safety and identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of dualCAR-NK19/70 in patients with r/r B-cell lymphomas.

Hypothesis: DualCAR-NK19/70 will be safe, well-tolerated, and effective in patients with r/r B-cell lymphomas.

Secondary Objectives:

--The secondary objective is to determine the efficacy in adults with r/r LBCL and FL grade 3B treated at the MTD or RP2D of dualCAR-NK19/70. Although the clinical benefit of dualCAR-NK19/70 has not yet been established, the intent of offering this treatment is to provide a possible therapeutic benefit, and thus the patient will be carefully monitored for tumor response and symptom relief in addition to safety and tolerability. Secondary endpoints include overall response rate (ORR; including CR + PR) and CR rate as defined by the Lugano Classification response criteria for malignant lymphoma, DOR, PFS, and OS.

Exploratory Objectives:

--The exploratory objectives are to assess the cellular kinetics and pharmacodynamic effects of dualCAR-NK19/70 and to evaluate biomarkers associated with response, resistance, and toxicity after administration of dualCAR-NK19/70 in blood and tumor samples.
