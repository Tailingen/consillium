A Study in Patients With BRAF V600E-mutant Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (OCTOPUS)
This study aims to describe the treatment patterns in clinical practice in adult patients with mNSCLC with a BRAF V600E mutation. This study will also describe Real-World Progression-Free Survival (rwPFS) and Overall Survival (OS) for treatments prescribed in routine practice for mNSCLC with BRAF V600E mutation. Adverse events (AEs) related to treatment management will also be described.
