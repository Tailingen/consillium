OTHER: The investigators will extract total protein, DNA and RNA from PSC patients.

The investigators will analyzed proteomes of paired normal lung tissues and pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma with or without metastasis, sequenced transcriptomes, perform whole exome sequencing, and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array profiling for triplets, each comprising normal lung tissue, primary pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma, and its synchronous matched metastasis, as well as analyzed genomics of lung cancer characterized previously by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to conduct integrated proteogenomic analyses.
