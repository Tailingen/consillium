Phase I, Open-label, Dose-escalation, Safety and PK Study of AZD6918
The primary purpose of this study is to find out what the maximum tolerated dose is for an experimental drug called AZD6918 based on the side effects experienced by patients with advanced solid malignancies that receive daily AZD6918 alone. It is possible that AZD6918 will be administered twice daily. Then maximum tolerated doses in combination with either gemcitabine or pemetrexed will also be investigated.
