A Phase 2 Trial of SCO-101 in Combination With FOLFIRI for Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (mCRC) With Acquired Resistance to FOLFIRI
This study evaluates the combination of SCO-101 to FOLFIRI for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer patients who have developed resistance to FOLFIRI treatment. The study is divided in two parts, where the first part evaluates the safety and toxicity of increasing doses of SCO-101 in combination with FOLFIRI at the same dose as the patient has previously developed resistance to. The second part of the study evaluates the safety and efficacy of the combination of FOLFIRI and SCO-101 at the dose level established in the first part.

This is a multi-center, open label, dose escalation, Phase 2 study of SCO-101 in combination with FOLFIRI in up to 50 mCRC patients. All patients included have previously had effect from treatment with FOLFIRI, but have now progressed (i.e. treatment failure due to acquired resistance).

FOLFIRI is a key anti-cancer chemotherapeutic combination in the treatment of several solid tumor cancers, e.g. colorectal cancer. Cancer resistance to FOLFIRI exposure is a well known phenomenon and can often be attributed to upregulation of cellular efflux pumps, e.g. ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC)G2 and ABCB1, involved in the efflux of the chemotherapeutic agents from the cancer cells and resulting in treatment failure.

SCO-101 is an inhibitor of ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) efflux pumps and SRPK1 kinase which is responsible for phosphorylation of splicing factors, a key element involved in tumour growth.

The combination of SCO-101 with FOLFIRI is expected to inhibit the active efflux of chemotherapy molecules from the cancer cell thereby re-sensitizing it to the chemotherapeutic agents.
