Exploring the Neo-Adjuvant Therapy Effects on Lung Cancer Through Monitoring and Assessment of Tumor Environment
This translational study aims to investigate how neoadjuvant therapy affects lung cancer patients by monitoring dynamic changes in the tumor environment. The study focuses on patients with histologically confirmed lung cancer, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC), who are eligible for neoadjuvant therapy in the LungMate clinical trial series. By analyzing intra-tumour genetic and functional heterogeneity following neoadjuvant therapy through multi-omic analysis (including genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and proteomics), this study could potentially identify new biomarkers or therapeutic targets that could improve lung cancer patient outcomes.
Lung Cancer
OTHER: Observation
Intratumour heterogeneity index, To validate ITH index as an independent biomarker of response to neoadjuvant therapy in patients with lung cancer mutation in a gene of interest through multi-omic analysis (genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, proteomics) based on sequential sampling over time.

Outcomes will be quantified using descriptive statistics with the intention of providing hypothesis-generating data for use in future studies., From trial activation until trial closure (approximately 15 May 2033)
