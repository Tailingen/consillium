A Study of JNJ-80948543 in Combination With Other CD3 T-Cell Engagers in Participants With Relapsed/Refractory B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (R/R B-Cell NHL)
The purpose of this study is to determine the recommended phase 2 regimen (RP2R) for JNJ-80948543 in combination with JNJ-75348780 (Part 1: Dose Escalation) and to further assess the safety of JNJ-80948543 at the RP2R in combination with JNJ-75348780 (Part 2: Dose Expansion).
Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin
DRUG: JNJ-80948543|DRUG: JNJ-75348780
Number of Participants with Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLT), Number of participants with DLT will be reported. DLTs are defined as any of the treatment-related toxicities: any toxicity that would require discontinuation of treatment; Fatal toxicity; Non-hematologic toxicity (Grade 3 toxicity or higher with exceptions); and Hematologic Toxicity (Grade 4 neutrophil count decrease; Grade 4 febrile neutropenia; Grade 3 febrile neutropenia that does not recover with best supportive care within 7 days; Grade 4 platelet count decrease for \>=7 days or Grade \>3 with Grade \>=2 bleeding; Grade 4 anemia)., Up to 1 year and 10 months|Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a pharmaceutical (investigational or non-investigational) product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the intervention., Up to 1 year and 10 months
Serum Concentration of JNJ-80948543 and JNJ-75348780, Serum Concentration for JNJ-80948543 and JNJ-75348780 will be reported., Up to 1 year and 10 months|Area Under the Curve (AUCtau) for JNJ-80948543 and JNJ-75348780, AUC tau is defined as area under the serum concentration-time curve during a dosing interval for JNJ-80948543 and JNJ-75348780., Up to 1 year and 10 months|Maximum Serum Concentration (Cmax) for JNJ-80948543 and JNJ-75348780, Cmax for JNJ-80948543 and JNJ-75348780 will be reported., Up to 1 year and 10 months|Time to Reach Cmax (Tmax) for JNJ-80948543 and JNJ-75348780, Tmax is the time to reach maximum observed serum concentration for JNJ-80948543 and JNJ-75348780., Up to 1 year and 10 months|Number of Participants with Presence of Anti-Drug Antibodies of JNJ-80948543 and JNJ-75348780, Number of participants with presence of anti-drug antibodies of JNJ-80948543 and JNJ-75348780 will be assessed., Up to 1 year and 10 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who have a best response of partial response (PR) or better as assessed by the investigator based on standard response criteria., Up to 1 year and 10 months|Complete Response Rate (CRR), CR is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve a best response of CR as assessed by the investigator based on standard response criteria., Up to 1 year and 10 months|Duration of Response (DoR), DOR is defined as the time from the first efficacy evaluation at which the participant meet all criteria for a response of PR or better to the date of first documented evidence of progressive disease or death as assessed by the investigator based on standard response criteria., Up to 1 year and 10 months
