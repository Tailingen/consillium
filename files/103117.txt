The Feasibility of Bilateral Intermediate Cervical Plexus Block for Thyroidectomy/Parathyroidectomy
The aim of this study was evaluated the feasibility of bilateral intermediate cervical plexus blockade to be anesthesia for simple thyroid/parathyroid surgery.
Parathyroid Adenoma|Thyroid Nodule
PROCEDURE: Bilateral intermediate cervical plexus block
Conversion to general anesthesia, inability to operate under nerve block and sedation, during operation
opioid usage, fentanyl consumption, intraoperative|dypnea, phrenic nerve paralysis, intraoperative|pain score within 24 hours, numerical rating score, within 24 hours postoperative|complications, local anesthetic systemic toxicity, intraoperative
Bilateral intermediate cervical plexus blocks have been reported for thyroid/parathyroid surgery. This technique combined with intravenous sedation has used with safety in patients undergoing simple thyroid or parathyroid surgery. Simple surgery is defined as the thyroid conditions are not cancer, redo or substernal goiter.
