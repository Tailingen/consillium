Percutaneous Cryoablation Versus Partial Nephrectomy for T1b Renal Tumor
The aim of our study is to assess the long-term oncological and functional outcomes of cryoablation for T1b renal tumors, as well as such important parameters as the patient's quality of life after treatment, and to compare the results with those after partial nephrectomy.
