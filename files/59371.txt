Study to Assess the Impact on Calcium Levels When Hemodialysis Patients With Secondary Hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) Switch From Cinacalcet to Etelcalcetide
This is a multicenter, multiple-dose, single-arm, open-label study to assess the impact on serum corrected calcium levels when switching patients from cinacalcet to etelcalcetide (AMG 416).
Hyperparathyroidism, Secondary
DRUG: Etelcalcetide
Percentage of Participants With Serum Corrected Calcium < 7.5 mg/dL During the 4-week Treatment Period, 4 weeks
Percent Change From Baseline in Parathyroid Hormone During the Treatment Period, Baseline and weeks 2, 3 and 4|Percentage of Participants With Serum Corrected Calcium < 8.3 mg/dL During the 4-week Treatment Period, 4 weeks
Number of Participants With Adverse Events, From the first dose of study drug up to 30 days after the last dose; 8 weeks|Percentage of Participants With Symptomatic Hypocalcemia During the 4-week Treatment Period, Hpocalcemia was used for events of decreased calcium accompanied by clinical signs and symptoms of hypocalcemia., From the first dose of study drug up to 30 days after the last dose; 8 weeks
