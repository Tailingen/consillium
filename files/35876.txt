Biliary Drainage Preceding Possible Pancreaticoduodenectomy. Are Self-expandable Metallic Stents (SEMS) Superior to Plastic Stents?
This study looks in to the rate of biliary stent dysfunction for plastic and metallic stents in patients who need biliary drainage due to a tumor in pancreas before possible pancreaticoduodenectomy. Complications related to the biliary decompression, and possible post-surgical complications in all patients are also recorded.

This trial aims to confirm whether metallic biliary stents really are superior to plastic stents as some previous studies suggest. Specific patient groups are also evaluated individually to see, whether patients with ongoing cholangitis at the time of diagnosis or patients receiving neoadjuvant treatments have less stent dysfunction cases and complications with metallic stents than with plastic stents.
