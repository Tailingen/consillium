A Study of the First-line Treatment of Patients With Newly Diagnosed Transplant-ineligible Multiple Myeloma in Spain
This is an observational, post-authorization, retrospective, multicenter study (PAS-OD) that will be conducted in approximately 20 centers in Spain. In all cases, only data recorded prior to the date of study start will be collected to ensure its retrospective nature, thus reflecting real clinical practice, avoiding any influence on the physician's clinical practice.
