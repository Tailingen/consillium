Phase 1 Dose Escalation and Expansion Study of TROP2 CAR Engineered IL15-transduced Cord Blood-derived NK Cells in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors (TROPIKANA)
To find the recommended dose of TROP2- CAR-NK cells that can be given to participants with advanced forms of solid tumors.
Solid Tumors
DRUG: Rimiducid|DRUG: TROP2-CAR-NK Cells|DRUG: Fludarabine phosphate|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide
Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, through study completion; an average of 1 year
Primary Objective:

1. To determine the safety, tolerability, optimal cell dose (OCD), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of TROP2-CAR-NK cells in participants with solid tumors with high TROP2 expression.

Secondary Objectives:

1. To determine the antitumor activity of TROP2-CAR-NK cells in participants with high TROP2-expressing NSCLC and high TROP2-expressing HER2-negative/low breast

   cancer. Although the clinical benefit of TROP2-CAR-NK cells has not yet been established, the intent of offering this treatment is to provide a possible therapeutic benefit and thus, the participant will be carefully monitored for tumor response and symptom relief in addition to safety and tolerability.
2. To quantify the persistence of infused allogeneic donor TROP2-CAR-NK cells in the peripheral blood of the recipient.
3. To evaluate tissue and blood-based biomarkers associated with response and resistance to TROP2-CAR-NK cell infusion.

Exploratory Objectives:

1. To profile and assess dynamic changes in the tumor microenvironment.
2. To evaluate longitudinal changes in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA).
