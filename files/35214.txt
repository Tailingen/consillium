Automated Method for Breast Cancer Detection
Participants with suspicious breast lesions by mammography will undergo fine needle aspiration (FNA) under ultrasound guidance. The FNA will be read by the cytopathologist and analyzed in the breast cancer detection cartridge. All patients will receive standard of care (Ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy and diagnosis). We will also receive FNA collected from 60 patients with palpable lesions in South Africa and analyze them samples in our lab with the same method.
Breast Cancer Diagnosis
PROCEDURE: Fine needle aspiration|DEVICE: Cancer Detection cartridge
Correlation of Diagnostic Cartridge With Histopathology as Assessed by Number of Participants With Same Diagnosis From Both Cancer Detection Cartridge and Core Biopsy or Resected Lesion, Number of participants in whom DNA methylation profile of 10 genes in the Cancer Detection cartridge correlates with diagnosis based on the gold standard of histopathology of the core biopsy or resected sample., up to 2 years|Correlation of Diagnostic Cartridge With Cytopathology as Assessed by Number of Participants With Same Diagnosis From Both Cancer Detection Cartridge and Cytology of Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA), Number of participants in whom DNA methylation profile of 10 genes as determined in the Cancer Detection cartridge correlates with FNA cytology, up to 2 years
Correlation of Diagnostic Cartridge With Known Lab Assay, Number of participants in whom gene-methylation prediction of FNA in the Cancer Detection cartridge is malignant or benign when compared to gene-methylation prediction of FNA using our known laboratory assay (QM-MSP), up to 2 years|Correlation of Known Lab Assay for FNA Versus the Core Biopsy, Number of participants in whom gene-methylation prediction of benign or malignant using our known laboratory assay (QM-MSP) matches for both the FNA sample and the core biopsy sample, up to 2 years|Correlation of Cartridge Based Quantitative Evaluation of Tumor Markers (ER/PR/Her2 and Ki67) in FNA Versus FFPE Sections, Number of participants with same expression of ER/PR/Her2 and Ki67 in FNAs of methylation positive breast lesions as with expression of ER/PR/Her2 and Ki67 in Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) sections of tumors using cartridge based quantitative evaluation, up to 2 years
