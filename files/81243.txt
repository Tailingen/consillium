Goal 1: Identify Local Inflammatory Response in Prostate Tissue and Systemic Response in the Blood of Patients with Prostate Cancer Depending on the Stage of the Disease and Evaluate Their Prognostic Value

Objective: To investigate and characterize both local and systemic inflammatory responses in prostate cancer patients at various disease stages.

Approach:

* Local Inflammatory Response: Examine prostate tissue samples to identify markers and levels of inflammation. This involves histological analysis and possibly molecular assays (e.g., PCR, immunohistochemistry).
* Systemic Inflammatory Response: Measure inflammatory markers in the blood, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukins (e.g., IL-6), and other cytokines.
* Disease Staging: Correlate these inflammatory responses with the stage of prostate cancer (e.g., localized, advanced, metastatic) to understand the progression of the disease.
* Prognostic Value: Analyze the data to determine if these inflammatory markers can predict disease progression, response to treatment, and overall prognosis.

Expected Outcome: Establish a comprehensive profile of inflammatory responses associated with different stages of prostate cancer and identify potential prognostic biomarkers.

Goal 2: Identify the Spectrum of Microorganisms and Antibiotic Resistance in Patients with Prostate Cancer Prior to Prostate Biopsy and Assess the Risk of Complications When Using Ciprofloxacin and Fosfomycin

Objective: To profile the microbial flora and antibiotic resistance in prostate cancer patients before biopsy, and evaluate the safety and efficacy of Ciprofloxacin and Fosfomycin.

Approach:

* Microbial Spectrum: Collect and analyze urine, prostatic fluid, and other relevant samples to identify bacterial species present using culture methods and molecular techniques.
* Antibiotic Resistance: Test the identified microorganisms for resistance to common antibiotics, focusing on Ciprofloxacin and Fosfomycin.
* Risk Assessment: Review patient outcomes post-biopsy to assess the incidence of complications such as infection and adverse reactions, particularly in relation to the use of the studied antibiotics.
* Data Analysis: Correlate microbial profiles and resistance patterns with clinical outcomes to determine the risk factors for complications.

Expected Outcome: Develop guidelines for antibiotic use in prostate biopsy procedures based on microbial and resistance profiles to minimize the risk of complications.

Goal 3: Determine the Significance of GAS5, JAZF1, and CTBP2 Gene Polymorphism in the Development of Prostate Cancer

Objective: To investigate the role of specific gene polymorphisms (GAS5, JAZF1, and CTBP2) in the susceptibility to and development of prostate cancer.

Approach:

* Genetic Analysis: Collect DNA samples from prostate cancer patients and a control group. Perform genotyping to identify polymorphisms in the GAS5, JAZF1, and CTBP2 genes.
* Association Studies: Conduct statistical analyses to compare the frequency of these polymorphisms in patients versus controls. Assess their correlation with the presence and severity of prostate cancer.
* Functional Studies: Where possible, explore the biological impact of these polymorphisms on gene expression and function, potentially through in vitro or in vivo models.

Expected Outcome: Identify genetic markers that contribute to prostate cancer risk, enhancing understanding of disease mechanisms and potential targets for intervention.

Goal 4: Evaluate the Associations of One Gene Polymorphism with the Clinical Course of Disease in Patients with Prostate Cancer

Objective: To determine how a specific gene polymorphism influences the clinical trajectory of prostate cancer.

Approach:

* Polymorphism Selection: Choose a gene polymorphism of interest, potentially based on findings from previous research or Goals 1-3.
* Clinical Data Collection: Gather comprehensive clinical data from prostate cancer patients, including disease stage, progression, treatment response, and outcomes.
* Genotype-Phenotype Correlation: Perform genetic testing to identify the presence of the polymorphism in these patients. Correlate the genetic data with clinical parameters to assess associations.
* Statistical Analysis: Use appropriate statistical methods to determine the significance of the associations between the polymorphism and various clinical aspects of prostate cancer.

Expected Outcome: Gain insights into how genetic variations can affect the progression and treatment response in prostate cancer, potentially guiding personalized treatment approaches.
