Insulin Resistance in Women With Prolactinoma
Prolactin is suggested to influence insulin resistance, but scarce data is available on the metabolic profile of patients with prolactinoma.

The purpose of the protocol was to evaluate cardiovascular disease risk factors in women with prolactinoma treated with dopamine agonists and to study the influence of disease control and anthropometry on their metabolic profile.
Prolactinoma|Insulin Resistance|Hyperlipidemia
A cross-sectional study was performed in non-obese premenopausal women with prolactinoma treated with dopamine agonists evaluated regarding glucose, insulin, Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA), lipid profile, C reactive protein (CRP), body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, prolactin, estradiol, testosterone, and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). They were compared with control women of similar age and BMI distribution.
