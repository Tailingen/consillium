Milciclib in Combination With Gemcitabine in Advanced NSCLC
The goal of this interventional clinical study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Milciclib plus gemcitabine in the treatment of persons with advanced NSCLC. This is an open label uncontrolled clinical trial

Eligible patients will receive 150 mg/day of milciclib orally using the 7 days on/7 days off schedule in combination with gemcitabine at the dose of 1000 mg/mÂ² on Days 1, 8, and 15 every 4 weeks. Treatment cycles will be repeated every 4 weeks until progressive disease (radiologic or symptomatic deterioration), the start of a new systemic anticancer therapy, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal per investigator's judgment, or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurs first.
NSCLC
DRUG: Milciclib Dose: 150 mg/day Mode of administration: oral
Disease progression, The primary endpoint is an independent, central reader-assessed, blinded to time of scan, and confirmed objective response rate (ORR), defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), using RECIST v1.1. Any patient with CR or PR must be able to confirm the CR or PR at least 4 weeks following the first observation., The study will be closed 6 months after the last scheduled visit
Duration of response, The secondary efficacy endpoints (using central reader-assessed response according to RECIST v1.1 when applicable) are:

* Duration of response (DoR), defined as the duration between first documentation of CR or PR to first documentation of disease progression or death
* Progression-free-survival (PFS), defined as the time from the date of first dose of study drug to the date of first documented disease progression or death due to any cause
* Time to response (TTR), defined as the time from first dose of study drug to first documentation of CR or PR
* Overall survival (OS), defined as the time from the date of first dose of study drug to the date of death due to any cause, time from date of randomization to date of death from any cause or end of study up to 12 months|Adverse Events, Incidence of AEs and SAEs, Up to 6 months after the last scheduled visit
This study is a multicenter, prospective, non-randomized, open-label, single-arm Phase 2 study in locally advanced non-resectable recurrent and/or metastatic KRAS-mutated NSCLC after failure of at least 1 line of SoC therapy.

All patients will be screened for KRAS mutation status. A total of up to 28 patients harboring G12A, G12D, G12F, G12R, G12S, G12V, or G13D KRAS mutations, or, any pathogenic KRAS mutation other than G12C mutations will be enrolled and treated. According to the Simon's 2-stage design, 13 patients will be treated at Stage 1 with up to 15 patients treated at Stage 2.

At the completion of Stage 1, a review of the tumor response evaluation will be undertaken to determine if the second stage should be conducted. If there are 2 or more patients with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) in the first 13 patients, an additional 15 patients will be accrued.

Stage 1 will be considered complete when all patients have experienced progressive disease (radiologic or symptomatic deterioration), started a new systemic anticancer therapy, have withdrawn per investigator's judgment or experienced unacceptable toxicity, have withdrawn consent, or have completed 6 cycles of treatment.

In addition, Stage 1 patients who, at the time of transition to Stage 2, were responding with a CR, PR, or stable disease, will be allowed to continue in the study at the recommended Phase 2 dose; or lower for safety reasons). These patients will not be part of the 15 new patients to be targeted in Stage 2, because they will have already received treatment with milciclib plus gemcitabine in Stage 1, but they will provide additional safety information regarding prolonged treatment with milciclib plus gemcitabine
