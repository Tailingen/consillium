Open-Label Extension Treatment With Etanercept (TNFR:Fc) for Participating Patients in Etanercept (TNFR:Fc) Clinical Trials
This study was designed to provide all adult and pediatric arthritis patients (placebo and etanercept(TNFR:Fc) treated) who have participated in clinical trials with etanercept (TNFR:Fc) the opportunity to receive continued treatment with etanercept (TNFR:Fc). The primary objective of this study is to examine safety parameters.
