Durvalumab With or Without Olaparib as Maintenance Therapy After First-Line Treatment of Advanced and Recurrent Endometrial Cancer
A study to assess the efficacy and safety of durvalumab in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy (paclitaxel + carboplatin) followed by maintenance durvalumab with or without olaparib for patients with newly diagnosed advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer.
Endometrial Neoplasms
DRUG: olaparib|BIOLOGICAL: durvalumab|DRUG: durvalumab placebo|DRUG: olaparib placebo|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Paclitaxel
Progression Free Survival (PFS) for Arm B vs Arm A and Arm C vs Arm A, Defined as the time from randomisation until the date of objective disease progression (per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by investigator) or death (by any cause in the absence of progression), Up to 4 years
Second Progression (PFS2), Defined as the time from randomisation to the earliest of progression event subsequent to first subsequent therapy (assessed by the investigator per local standard clinical practice and may involve any of the following: objective radiological imaging, symptomatic progression), or death due to any cause, Up to 6 years|Overall Survival (OS), Defined as the time from randomisation to death due to any cause, Up to 6 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Defined as the proportion of patients with measurable disease at baseline who have confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as determined by the Investigator at local site., Up to 4 years|Duration of response (DoR), Defined as time from the date of first documented response until date of documented progression or death in the absence of disease progression, Up to 4 years|Time to first subsequent therapy (TFST), Defined as the time from randomisation to the earlier of start date of the first subsequent anti-cancer therapy after discontinuation of randomised treatment or death due to any cause, Up to 6 years|Time to second subsequent therapy (TSST), Defined as the time from randomisation to the earlier of start date of the second subsequent anti-cancer therapy after discontinuation of first subsequent treatment or death due to any cause., Up to 6 years|Time to discontinuation or death (TDT), Defined as the time from randomisation to the earlier of the date of study treatment discontinuation or death., Up to 6 years|The pharmacokinetics (PK) of durvalumab will be determined after steady state doses, Determination of durvalumab concentration in serum, Up to 4 years|Safety and tolerability of drugs by assessment of AEs/SAEs, Graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI CTCAE), Up to 6 years|The immunogenicity of durvalumab as determined by concentration of Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) to durvalumab, Determination concentration of Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) to durvalumab in serum, Up to 4 years
This Phase III study will assess the efficacy and safety of durvalumab in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy (paclitaxel + carboplatin) followed by maintenance durvalumab with or without olaparib for patients with newly diagnosed advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer.

Target patient population: Adult female patients with histologically confirmed diagnosis of epithelial endometrial carcinoma (excluding sarcomas): newly diagnosed Stage III, newly diagnosed Stage IV, or recurrent endometrial cancer
