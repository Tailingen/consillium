Avatrombopag for Thrombocytopenia in People With Cancer
This study will test whether avatrombopag is an effective treatment for thrombocytopenia in people who have both cancer and a liver disease (such as cirrhosis, cholangitis, or hepatitis). Researchers will look at whether giving participants avatrombopag for 3 weeks can raise their platelet levels enough for them to begin chemotherapy. The study will also test whether avatrombopag can continue to be effective against thrombocytopenia while participants are on chemotherapy for 12 weeks or longer. In addition, researchers will determine how safe the study drug is in participants.
Thrombocytopenia|Cancer|Liver Diseases
DRUG: Avatrombopag
Number of patients who achieve platelet counts of ≥ 100,000/mcL, the platelet count is ≥ 100,000/mcL, this will be considered successful achievement of the primary endpoint, within 3 weeks of treatment
Number of patients who can undergo systemic cancer therapy without more than one dose delay or dose reduction, without platelets dropping below 100,000/mcL on the day of the start of next scheduled cycle of systemic cancer therapy, 12 weeks
