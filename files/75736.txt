A Study of Nivolumab, Ipilimumab, and Chemotherapy in Participants With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to describe the real-world patient and disease characteristics of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) participants initiated on first-line (1L) treatment with nivolumab, ipilimumab, and platinum-based chemotherapy (NIVO/IPI/PBC), in the overall study population and the subpopulations per histological subtype of NSCLC and PD-L1 expression level.
