Proteogenomic Signatures Analysis In Ovarian Cancer
Proteogenomic analysis to detect individual platinum-induced modifications on tumor tissue of HGSC according to chemotherapy response score (CRS), using a combined approach of High resolution liquid chromatography mass Spectrometry based platform (HR-LC-MS/MS and advanced immunometric methods on illumine platform); multiple supervised machine learning algorithms will be used to discover proteogenomic signatures and biological processes associated with platinum modification during the neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment. These results contribute to precision medicine by building an accurate proteogenomic profile of ovarian cancer, in order to better understand the underlying mechanisms of different chemotherapy response among affected patients.
