Dynamic Area Telethermometry (DAT) as an Imaging Modality in Patients With Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether this new method of taking pictures called Dynamic Area Telethermometry (DAT) might be a good way of looking at patients with cancer that is relatively close to the surface of the body.
Malignant Tumors|Subcutaneous Tumors|Lymph Node Tumors
PROCEDURE: Dynamic Area Telethermometry (DAT)
To assess the feasibility of DAT in tumors detected by conventional imaging and evaluation of therapy induced changes in DAT imaging profile over time.
* The DAT system resembles a video camera which picks up changes in body temperature which may reflect disease-related changes in blood flow to some areas, particularly those involved with tumors.
* Patients with known tumor sites amendable to DAT evaluation will be imaged at the time of staging and at later time points. Thermal profiles will be compared to those of normal adjacent tissues and correlated with the images of the tumors on conventional images.
