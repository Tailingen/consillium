Trial of Chidamide in Combination With Exemestane in Patients With Advanced Breast Cancer
This study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Chidamide in combination with exemestane in postmenopausal patients with hormone-receptor positive advanced breast cancer.

DRUG: Chidamide|DRUG: exemestane|DRUG: placebo
progression-free survival (PFS), double-blinded period, PFS is measured from the date of randomization until progression or death, whichever is first met, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 3 years|pharmacokinetic profiles of Chidamide, open-label period, The pharmacokinetic parameters include Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) , Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax), time to reach Cmax (Tmax), mean concentration at steady state (Css), 0,1,2,4,8,12,24,48,72 hours after the first dose of Chidamide on day 2 at induced stage (4 days in total); 0,1,2,4,8,12,24,48,72 hours post-dose on day 1 of cycle 1 at combination treatment stage|pharmacokinetic profiles of exemestane, open-label period, The pharmacokinetic parameters include Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) , Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax), time to reach Cmax (Tmax), mean concentration at steady state (Css), 0,1,2,4,8,12,24 hours after the first dose of exemestane on day 1 at induced stage (4 days in total); 0,1,2,4,8,12,24,48,72 hours post-dose on day 1 of cycle 1 at combination treatment stage|acetylation level of histone H3, open-label period, The acetylation level of histone H3 is assayed by enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA)., pre-dose of Chidamide on day 2 at induced stage (4 days in total); pre-dose of Chidamide on day 1 of cycle 2 at combination treatment stage
overall survival, double-blinded period, OS is measured from the date of randomization until death, Time from randomization to death from any cause, assessed up to 6 years|duration of response (DOR), double-blinded period, DOR is measured from the first date when criteria for response is met until the first date when the criteria for progression is met, From the first date of response until the date of first documented progression, assessed up to 3years|objective response rate (ORR), open-label period and double-blinded period, ORR is defined as percentage of participants with Complete Response and Partial Response, assessed by the investigators according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), Response is assessed once every 6 weeks, assessed up to 3 years|clinical benefit rate (CBR), open-label period and double-blinded period, ORR is defined as percentage of participants with Complete Response, Partial Response or Stable Disease â‰¥ 24 weeks, assessed by the investigators according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), Response is assessed once every 6 weeks, assessed up to 3 years|PFS, open-label period, PFS is measured from the start of treatment until progression or death, whichever is first met, Time from the start of treatment to the earliest of documented disease progression, or death, assessed up to 3 years
This study including two parts: (1) Part A, open-label design, 20 patients will be enrolled and receive 30 mg Chidamide BIW and 25 mg exemestane QD. The main object of part A is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of Chidamide when in combination with exemestane. (2) Part B, randomized and double-blinded design, 328 patients will be assigned randomly in a 2:1 ratio to experiment group (30 mg Chidamide BIW + 25 mg exemestane QD) and control group (placebo BIW + 25 mg exemestane QD), to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Chidamide when in combination with exemestane in patients with locally advanced or metastatic estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer progressing on endocrine therapy.
