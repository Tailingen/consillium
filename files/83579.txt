Sorafenib Long Term Extension Program
The primary purpose of program was to enable patients, currently receiving sorafenib (Nexavar) in a Bayer/Onyx sponsored clinical trial, to continue sorafenib treatment after their respective study had met its primary endpoint and/or had reached the end as defined in the original protocol. Patients were able to continue treatment until (i) the treating physician felt the patient was no longer benefiting from the treatment or (ii) the treatment becomes commercially available and reimbursed for the respective indication as applicable in the country in which the patient lived and the patient could obtain suitable amounts of drug for treatment through standard mechanisms of commercial availability (ie, there should be no interruption in the patient's treatment schedule when switching to commercially available product) or (iii) the patient could join a Post-Trial-Access Program, another study or can receive sorafenib through any other mechanism (e.g. local access program) in accordance with local legal and compliance rules, with no cost to the patient with respect to sorafenib.

An additional objective was the assessment of the safety of Nexavar or Nexavar combination treatment.

DRUG: Sorafenib (Nexavar, BAY43-9006)
Sorafenib Treatment Duration Within STEP, Treatment duration was calculated in days as the date of the last dose of any study treatment minus date of the first dose of any study treatment plus one day., From the date of the first sorafenib dose until the date of the last sorafenib dose, with a mean duration of 25 months and max duraton of 153.8 months|Number of Participants With New Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered with a pharmaceutical product. The adverse event did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. A serious adverse event (SAE) was any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: resulted in death; was life-threatening; required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability or incapacity; was a congenital anomaly or birth defect; was an important medical event. A new treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was any AE that had a start date on or after ICF date in STEP and up to 30 days after the last sorafenib dose. A drug-related new TEAE was any new TEAE that had a causal relationship with the study treatment as assessed by the investigator., From signing the informed consent form (ICF) in STEP until 30 days after the last sorafenib dose, with a mean duration of 26 months|Number of Participants With New TEAEs of CTCAE Grades 3 or Higher by Worst CTCAE Grade, An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered with a pharmaceutical product. The AE did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. A new treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was any AE that had a start date on or after ICF date in STEP and up to 30 days after the last sorafenib dose. The intensity or severity of AEs were graded using the National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria, Version 3.0 (NCI-CTC v. 3.0). The Common Terminology Criteria for AE (CTCAE) are a set of criteria for the standardized classification of adverse effects of drugs used in cancer therapy. It uses a range of grades from 1 to 5. Specific conditions and symptoms may have values or descriptive comment for each level, but the general guideline is: Grade 1 - mild; Grade 2 - moderate; Grade 3 - severe; Grade 4 - life-threatening; Grade 5 - death., From signing the ICF in STEP until 30 days after the last sorafenib dose, with a mean duration of 26 months|Number of Participants With Study Drug-related New TEAEs of CTCAE Grades 3 or Higher by Worst CTCAE Grade, An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered with a pharmaceutical product. The AE did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. A new treatment-emergent AE (TEAE) was any AE that had a start date on or after ICF date in STEP and up to 30 days after the last sorafenib dose. A drug-related new TEAE was a new TEAE that had a causal relationship with the study treatment as assessed by the investigator. The intensity or severity of AEs were graded using the National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria (CTC v3). The Common Terminology Criteria for AE (CTCAE) are a set of criteria for the standardized classification of adverse effects of drugs used in cancer therapy. It uses a range of grades from 1 to 5. The general guideline is: Grade 1 - mild; Grade 2 - moderate; Grade 3 - severe; Grade 4 - life-threatening; Grade 5 - death., From signing the ICF in STEP until 30 days after the last sorafenib dose, with a mean duration of 26 months|Number of Participants With All Adverse Events, An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered with a pharmaceutical product. The AE did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. A drug-related AE was any AE that had a causal relationship with the study treatment as assessed by the investigator. All AEs in STEP were the combination of AEs ongoing from feeder studies and new TEAEs., From signing the ICF in STEP until 30 days after the last sorafenib dose, with a mean duration of 26 months|Number of Participants With All Adverse Events of CTCAE Grades 3 or Higher by Worst CTCAE Grade, An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered with a pharmaceutical product.

Hematology and blood chemistry values were graded based on the applicable laboratory threshold values outlined in NCI CTCAE version 3.0. Participants with a specific laboratory value that were "not graded" are not included in the table. CTCAE grade was set to "not graded" if the reference ranges or other information necessary to derive grades were unavailable or result had a special character (such as \> or \< ).
