Study of High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) Combined With Toripalimab Plus Chemotherapy Versus Chemotherapy as Neoadjuvant Therapy for Estrogen Receptor-Positive/Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2-Negative (ER+/HER2-) Breast Cancer (NeoHunter)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) combined with toripalimab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy as neoadjuvant therapy for ER+/HER2- breast cancer.
ER+/HER2- Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: HIFU|DRUG: Toripalimab|DRUG: nab-Paclitaxel (nab-P)|DRUG: Epirubicin (E)|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide (C)
Total Pathological Complete Response (tpCR) Rate: ypT0/Tis, ypN0, The tpCR rate is defined as the proportion of participants with no residual invasive cancer cells in both the breast primary tumor site (residual in situ cancer cells are permitted) and all sampled axillary lymph nodes., Up to approximately 30 weeks
Breast Pathological Complete Response (bpCR) Rate: ypT0/Tis, The bpCR rate is defined as the proportion of participants with no residual invasive cancer cells in the breast primary tumor site (residual in situ cancer cells are permitted)., Up to approximately 30 weeks|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of participants with a complete or partial response., Up to approximately 30 weeks|Event-Free Survival (EFS), EFS is defined as the time from randomization to any of the following events: precludes surgery, local or distant recurrence, second primary malignancy, or death due to any cause., Approximately five years|Adverse Event (AE), An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a study participant administered a medicinal product, temporally associated with study intervention, without presumption of causality., Approximately three years
Study participants will be randomly allocated to either the experimental group or the control group and receive the following treatments. Experimental group: HIFU therapy followed by 8 cycles of neoadjuvant immunotherapy and chemotherapy; Control group: 8 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone. Each cycle lasts 21 days. Subsequently, all participants will undergo surgery within 6 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant therapy.
