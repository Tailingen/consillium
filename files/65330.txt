A Study in Cancer Patients to Evaluate the Effect of a Single Dose of NKTR-102 (Etirinotecan Pegol) on the QTc Interval and to Assess Pharmacokinetics and Safety
The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the effect of NKTR-102 on the QT/QTc interval in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors
Advanced Cancer|Metastatic Solid Tumors
DRUG: NKTR-102
QTcF interval values, 10 pre-dose and 18 post-dose ECG measurements to evaluate the effect of NKTR-102, Day -1 through Day 42
Pharmacokinetics (PK) and ECG Parameters, 1 pre-dose and 18 post-dose blood samples to measure concentrations of NKTR-102 and its metabolites, Day 1 through Day 42
This is an open-label study that will assess the effect of NKTR- 102 on cardiac ventricular repolarization, as characterized by QTcF (QT interval with Fridericia correction) interval values, in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors following administration of a single dose of NKTR-102.
