Sufficient Chemotherapy Combine With Maintenance Chemotherapy in the Treatment of Oligometastatic Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
This study is a randomized, phase II, prospective, multicenter clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sufficient chemoradiotherapy plus oral capecitabine/S-1 for 1 year in the treatment of oligometastatic Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
DRUG: Capecitabine/S-1|DRUG: Chemotherapy|RADIATION: Head and neck radiotherapy|OTHER: Local Consolidative Therapy
Progression-Free Survival(PFS), PFS was defined as the time from randomization to first documented disease progression (PD) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. For target lesions, PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of the longest diameter recorded since treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions. For non-target lesions, PD was defined as the appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions., 12 months and 24 months
overall survival(OS), OS was defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause, 12 months and 24 months
