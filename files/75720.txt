A Single-Arm Pilot Study of Adjuvant Pembrolizumab Plus Trastuzumab in HER2+ Esophagogastric Tumors With Persistent Circulating Tumor DNA Following Curative Resection
The purpose of this study is to find out whether treatment with trastuzumab combined with pembrolizumab will improve the clearance of tumor DNA from participants' bodies after surgery.

Rate of ctDNA Clearance at 6 Months, The primary endpoint of the study is the proportion of patients with ctDNA clearance at 6 months with trastuzumab/pembrolizumab or trastuzumab/placebo in patients with HER2+ esophagogastric cancer with persistent ctDNA despite curative surgery and standard perioperative/adjuvant therapy.

CtDNA clearance is the conversion of detectable to undetectable ctDNA, 6 months
The purpose of this study is to find out whether treatment with trastuzumab combined with pembrolizumab will improve the clearance of tumor DNA from participants' bodies after surgery.
