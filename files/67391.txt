Open-Label Study to Determine the Maximum Tolerated Oral Dose of the Kinase Inhibitor CEP-11981 in Patients With Advanced Cancer
The primary objective of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities of CEP-11981 in patients with advanced, relapsed/refractory solid tumors.
