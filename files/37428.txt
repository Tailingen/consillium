Humanized Monoclonal Antibody 3F8 (Hu3F8) With Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) in the Treatment of Recurrent Osteosarcoma
The purpose of this study is to find out what effect an antibody called Humanized 3F8 (Hu3F8) and a drug called GM-CSF have on the patient and whether it can keep the patient in remission longer and/or prevent recurrence of the disease.
Recurrent Osteosarcoma
BIOLOGICAL: humanized anti-GD2 antibody|DRUG: GM-CSF
event free survival (EFS), EFS is defined as the time from surgery to relapse or death from any cause, recurrence of tumor or second malignancy., 12 months
time to recurrence, Time to recurrence will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods. Very few patients are expected to die without relapse (\<5%). Recurrence is defined as the radiographic presence of any new lesion that is not attributable to differences in scanning techniques, change in imaging modality or findings thought to represent something other than osteosarcoma, or if a biopsy is performed which shows osteosarcoma., 12 months
