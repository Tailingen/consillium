Safety Study of SGX523, a Small Molecule Met Inhibitor, to Treat Solid Tumors
SGX523 is a drug which acts by blocking the function of an enzyme called MET. MET activity may be important in growth and survival of some types of cancer. This Phase I trial is studying the safety, side effects, and best dose of SGX523 when given to patients with advanced cancer, and how well it inhibits MET activity in tumors.
