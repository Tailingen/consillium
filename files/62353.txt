BBI608 and Best Supportive Care vs Placebo and Best Supportive Care in Pretreated Advanced Colorectal Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to find out whether it is better to receive a new drug, BBI608, or better to receive no further treatment for colon or rectal cancer. To do this, half of the patients in this study will get BBI608 and the other half will receive a placebo (a substance that is designed not to do anything).
Colorectal Carcinoma
DRUG: BBI608|DRUG: Placebo|OTHER: Best Supportive Care
Overall Survival, Time from the day of randomization to death. For alive patients, overall survival was censored at the last day the patient was known alive (LKA)., 36 month
Progression Free Survival, Defined as the time from randomization to the first objective documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause., 36 months|Disease Control Rate, Proportion of all randomized patients with a documented complete response (CR) defined as disappearance of all target lesions, partial response (PR) defined as \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, and stable disease (SD) defined as \<30% decrease but also \<20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions without new lesions per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST) 1.1 for target lesion., 36 months|Number of Patients With Adverse Events, Number of patients with at least one adverse event as assessed by NCI CTCAE Version 3.0 criteria., 36 months|Change of Global Quality of Life at 8 Weeks From Baseline, Change scores from baseline at time 2 (8 weeks) from baseline for the global health status/quality of life scale scores (between 0 and 100 with higher value indicating better quality of life) as derived from responses of patients to the EORTC (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer) quality of life questionnaire (QLQ-C30)., 8 weeks
This research is being done because currently there are no approved remaining effective treatments for colon or rectal cancer.

The purpose of this study is to compare the effects on colon cancer of a new drug, BBI608, and best supportive care (BSC) compared to BSC alone.

BBI608 has been shown to shrink tumours in animals and has been studied in a few people and seems promising, but it is not clear if it can offer better results than the usual care which is best supportive care alone.

The standard or usual treatment for this disease is treatment with drugs and other treatments that may help to make a patient feel better or may improve their quality of life. This treatment is known as "best supportive care" (BSC). Although patients with best supportive care can feel better for some months, the cancer usually continues to grow.
