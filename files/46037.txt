BIOLOGICAL: autologous ET1402L1-CART cells
Number of patients with dose-limiting toxicity, A dose limiting toxicity is defined as any toxicity that is considered to be primarily related to the ET1402L1-CART-cells, which is irreversible, or life threatening or CTCAE Grade 3-5. Assessed at all visits., 28 days up to 2 years|Toxicity profile of ET1402L1-CART-cell treatment, Frequency of treatment-related adverse events that occurred at any time from the first day of infusion that are "possibly", "likely", or "definitely" related to the study, including infusion related toxicity and ET1402L1-CART T cells related toxicity. Include but not limited to: Fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, jaundice and other gastrointestinal symptoms; Fatigue, hypotension, respiratory distress; Tumor lysis syndrome; Cytokine release syndrome; Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia; Liver and kidney dysfunction. Assessed at all visits., 28 days up to 2 years
Rate of disease response by RECIST in the liver, Response rates will be estimated as the percent of patients with objective response (OR), complete remission (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), no response (NR), overall survival (OS)., 2 years|Rate of disease response by RECIST at non-liver sites, Response rates will be estimated as the percent of patients with objective response (OR), complete remission (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), no response (NR), overall survival (OS)., 2 years|Anti-tumor responses, Progression free survival (PFS) and Median survival (MS) at 4 months, 1 year, 2 years, 4 months, 1 year, 2 years|AFP serum levels, Percent change compared to the baseline, 2 years|CART cell engraftment, Number and % of ET1402L1-CART cells in peripheral blood will be presented as Time to peak, Time to baseline level and the overall exposure will be presented as area under curve (AUC)., 2 years|AFP expression in tumors, Percent of AFP-positive cells in randomly selected fields in tumor biopsies, 4-8 weeks|Tmax of serum cytokine levels, Increases or decreases in the amount of cytokine produced compared to baseline at time points measured up to 24 weeks since dosing. Cytokines as measured by Bio-Plex Multiplex Immuoassays will be presented as time to peak level., 24 weeks|Time to baseline for serum cytokine levels, Increases or decreases in the amount of cytokine produced compared to baseline at time points measured up to 24 weeks since dosing.

The molecular target for ET1402L1-CART is alpha fetoprotein (AFP), which is expressed on 60-80 percent of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). ET1402L1-CART is a second generation (CD28/CD3Î¶) chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) engineered with a human single-chain variable antibody fragments (scFv) against the anti-HLA-A02/AFP complex. This clinical study evaluates the safety and pharmacokinetics of ET1402L1-CART-cells in patients with HCC who have no available curative therapeutic options and a poor overall prognosis.

Patients with lesion(s) localized in liver will be enrolled in the IA arm, with the ET1402L1-CART-cells administered via intrahepatic artery catheter. Patients with extrahepatic metastasis will be enrolled in the IV arm, with the ET1402L1-CART-cells administered through intravenous infusion.
