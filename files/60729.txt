Ganitumab in Locally Advanced Unresectable Adenocarcinoma of the Pancreas
This study is a phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active placebo-controlled trial of AMG 479 or placebo in combination with gemcitabine as first-line therapy for locally advanced unresectable adenocarinoma of the pancreas. Approximately 150 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to AMG 479 and gemcitabine, or gemcitabine and placebo. Randomization will be stratified by ECOG (0 or 1).

Gemcitabine will be given on days 1, 8, and 15, followed by AMG 479 on days 1 and 15 of every 28 day cycle. Treatment will continue until radiographic disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or start of a new anti-cancer therapy.
Adenocarcinoma of the Pancreas|Locally Advanced|Unresectable
DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: AMG 479|DRUG: Placebo
The Primary Endpoint is Progression-free Survival (PFS) as Defined as the Time From Randomization to Progression (Per RECIST v1.1) or Death., The time from randomization to progression (per RECIST version 1.1) or death from any cause. Disease progression per RECIST is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions in reference to the smallest sum on study and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm; the appearance of any new lesions is also considered progression., From randomization to the date of either disease progression or death, up to 181 days progression or death
Overall Survival, OS - time from study day 1 to death (by any cause), Up to 181 days|Number of Participants With Adverse Events, Measured via CTCAE v3.0, Up to 4 months|Progression Free Survival Rate and Overall Survival Rate at at 3 and 6 Months, Objective Response Rate, Disease Control Rate, PFS rates - subjects with disease progression (PD) or death at the timepoint; OS rates - subjects alive at the timepoint; ORR - tumor response assessment of either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST); DCR - subjects with PR, CR, or SD Per RECIST: CR=disappearance of all target lesions; PR=at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters; Disease progression=at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions in reference to the smallest sum on study; stable disease is disease that is not partial or progressed, Up to 181 days|Duration of Response, DOR - time from the first observation of an objective response (subjects with CR or PR) to the time of PD or death; Per RECIST: CR=disappearance of all target lesions; PR=at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters; Disease progression=at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions in reference to the smallest sum on study; stable disease is disease that is not partial or progressed, Up to 181 days|Number of Participants With Anti-AMG 479 Antibodies, post-dose anti-AMG 479 antibody positive rate, Up to 181 days
