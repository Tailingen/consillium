A Clinical Prospective Study to Validate a Risk Scoring Model for the HMGC After Curative Surgery
A previous study of investigators established a risk scoring model for the occurrence of postoperative hepatic metastases in patients who underwent curative gastrectomy directly without neoadjuvant therapy. In order to further validate the clinical applicability of abovementioned model, investigators designed this prospective study, which also included patients who received neoadjuvant therapy before surgery, with the aim of exploring the applicability of the risk scoring model to this group of patients.
Predictive Cancer Model|Hepatic Metastasis|Gastric Cancer
hepatic metastasis, Postoperative telephone follow-up was performed in patients with gastric cancer undergoing curative gastrectomy to determine the occurrence of hepatic metastasis., 2 years after curative surgery
interval between the surgery and hepatic metastasis, Postoperative telephone follow-up was performed in patients with gastric cancer undergoing curative gastrectomy to determine the interval between the gastrectomy and development of hepatic metastasis., 2 years after curative surgery
The study was a single-centre, prospective study. Prospectively collected data were used to analyze the consistency between the actual outcomes of patients with or without hepatic metastases after curative gastrectomy and the predicted outcomes of the risk scoring model, in order to assess the clinical applicability of the model. In addition, analyses were performed to compare the differences in the risk of hepatic metastasis and the time interval of occurrence between patients who did not receive neoadjuvant therapy and those who received neoadjuvant therapy, as well as between patients with different outcomes after receiving neoadjuvant therapy (TRG 0-1 vs. TRG 2-3 in postoperative pathology).
