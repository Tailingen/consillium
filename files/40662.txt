A Feasibility Study on Adaptive 18F-FDG-guided Radiotherapy for Recurrent and Second Primary Head and Neck Cancer in the Previously Irradiated Territory.
Adaptive dose painting appears to increase the chance of cure at minimized radiation-induced toxicity in intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for primary head and neck cancer. This could also be of importance in IMRT for recurrent and second primary head and neck cancers in previously irradiated territory.

This trial investigates the feasibility of continuous adaptive 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose-Positron Emission Tomography-voxel (\[18F\]FDG-PET-voxel) intensity-based IMRT in reirradiation of patients with recurrent and second primary head and neck cancer.
