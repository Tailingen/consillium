Managing Distress in Malignant Brain Cancer
To identify potential adaptations of the managing cancer and living meaningfully (CALM) intervention that will be required for service members, Veterans, their beneficiaries, and civilian cancer metastasis to the brain (bMET) populations.
Cancer Metastatic to Brain|Brain Metastases, Adult
BEHAVIORAL: CALM Intervention
Assess the Need for Adaptations to the CALM Intervention as Measured by the Applicability of the 4 CALM Domains, At the exit interview, participants will be asked to rate the applicability of the four CALM domains on a Likert Scale from 1 (not applicable) to 5 (very applicable). The four CALM domains are as follows: Domain 1) represents symptom management and communication with healthcare providers, Domain 2) reflects changes in personal relationships, Domain 3) sense of meaning and purpose, and Domain 4) the future, hope and mortality. Higher scores mean greater applicability., 4 Months|Feasibility of CALM Intervention in the Proof of Concept Project as Measured by the Rates of Participant Screening, Eligibility, and Consent., Determine how many patients consent to screening after referral to the program, how many patients are eligible for the program after being screened, and how many consent/enroll in the program if eligible., 12 months|Feasibility of CALM Intervention in the Proof of Concept Project as Measured by Attendance at CALM Sessions, Percent of sessions attended across all participants, 3 Months|Feasibility of CALM Intervention in the Proof of Concept Project as Measured by the Rates of Post-session Assessment Completion, Percent of post-session surveys completed by participants immediately after the intervention, 3 Months|Feasibility of CALM Intervention in the Proof of Concept Project as Measured by Post-intervention Assessment Completion, Percent of post-intervention surveys completed, 3 Months|Benefit of Intervention in the Proof of Concept Project, Benefit will be assessed by participant responses to a question during the exit interview (e.g., Rate your overall benefit on a scale of 1-5)., 4 Months
Single-arm, mixed-methods, Phase IIa, proof-of-concept trial to inform CALM adaptations for service members (SMs), Veterans, their beneficiaries, and civilians with bMET.
