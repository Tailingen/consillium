PhII Trial Panitumumab, Nivolumab, Ipilimumab in Kras/Nras/BRAF Wild-type MSS Refractory mCRC
To investigate the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab with panitumumab in subjects with unresectable, refractory, KRAS/NRAS/BRAF wild-type, microsatellite stable (MSS) metastatic colorectal cancer.
Colon Cancer
DRUG: Panitumumab|DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: Ipilimumab
Overall Response Rate, Overall Response Rate (ORR) = CR + PR Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, 12 weeks
Overall Response Rate Per irRECIST, Overall Response Rate (ORR) = irCR + irPR Per immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST) for target and/or non-target lesions and assessed by imaging: Complete Response (irCR), Disappearance of all lesions, no new lesions, lymph nodes \< 10 mm in short axis; Partial Response (irPR), ≥30% decrease in the sum of target lesions and non-target lesions are irNN; Stable response (irSD), not meeting criteria for irCR, irPR, or irPD; Progressive Disease (irPD), ≥20% increase in tumor burden and minimum 5 mm absolute increase in compared to nadir; for no new non-target or (irNN) and where irPR or irPD are confirmed by a repeat, consecutive assessment no less than 4 weeks later, 12 weeks|Length of Progression Free Survival, Time from first day of treatment until disease progression as defined by RECIST, irRECIST, or death from any cause, Up to 3 years|Length of Overall Survival, Time from first day of treatment until death from any cause, Up to 3 years|Duration of Response, Time from documentation of tumor response to disease progression, Up to 3 years|Toxicity of Treatment, The number of treatment-emergent grade 3 and 4 toxicities as defined by National Cancer Institute - Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE v4.03), Up to 36 month
The investigators will conduct a single-arm, open-label Phase II clinical trial investigating the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab with panitumumab in subjects with unresectable, refractory, KRAS/NRAS/BRAF wild-type, microsatellite stable (MSS) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). There will be an initial safety lead-in cohort to ensure the combination is well-tolerated. The primary objective of this study is to estimate the overall response rate in these subjects at 12 weeks . Secondary objectives include the following: estimating the overall response rate in these subjects at 12 weeks by immune-related RECIST criteria (irRECIST), estimating the best response rate by both RECIST 1.1 and irRECIST criteria, estimating progression-free survival (PFS) and duration of response using both RECIST 1.1 and irRECIST criteria, estimating overall survival (OS), and characterizing the safety issues associated with this regimen. Exploratory objectives involve investigating various biomarkers and peripheral blood and tumor assays.
