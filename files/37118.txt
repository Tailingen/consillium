Rises in PSA within the first 12 weeks of the date of first dose were ignored; 2) Where no decline from baseline was documented, PSA progression was defined as a \>= 25% increase from the baseline value along with an increase in absolute value of 2 ng/mL or more after 12 weeks from the date of first dose (without confirmation) as specified in the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 3 (PCWG3) guidelines., Through study completion, assessed up to 2 years.|For phase I/II:Radiographic Progression-free Survival (rPFS), Radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) was defined as the time (in months) from the date of enrollment to the date of radiographic disease progression per the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria or death due to any cause., Through study completion, assessed up to 2 years.|For phase I/II:Overall Response Rate (ORR), Overall Response Rate (ORR) was defined as the proportion of participants with Best Overall Response (BOR) of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR). ORR was based on RECIST 1.1 response for patients with measurable disease at baseline., Through study completion, assessed up to 2 years.|For phase I/II: Duration of Response (DOR), Duration of Response (DOR) was defined as the duration between the date of first documented Best Overall Response (BOR) of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) and the date of first documented radiographic progression or death due to any cause ., Through study completion, assessed up to 2 years.|For phase I/II:Disease Control Rate (DCR), Disease control rate (DCR) was defined as the proportion of participants with Best Overall Response (BOR) of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) or Stable Disease (SD) according to RECIST v1.1., Through study completion, assessed up to 2 years.|For phase I/II:Health related quality of life(HRQOL), Patient evaluation with questionnaires regarding Quality of Life ., Through study completion, assessed up to 2 years.|For phase I/II:Time to First Symptomatic Skeletal Event (SSE), Time to first Symptomatic Skeletal Event (SSE) was defined as the time (in months) from the date of enrollment to the date of the SSE or death from any cause. The SSE date was the date of first new symptomatic pathological bone fracture, spinal cord compression, tumor-related orthopedic surgical intervention, requirement for radiation therapy to relieve bone pain, or death due to any cause., Through study completion, assessed up to 2 years.|For phase I/II:Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS) was defined as the time (in months) from the date of enrollment to the date of death due to any cause. If the patient was not known to have died, then OS was censored. The censoring date was date of the last study visit, or contact, until the cut-off date., Through study completion, assessed up to 2 years.|For phase II:Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability])of [177Lu]Lu-XT033, To evaluate the safety and tolerability of \[177Lu\]Lu-XT033 Injection assessed from the number and incidence of patients with adverse events using CTCAE v5.0 and physical examination, electrocardiogram and laboratory abnormality, etc, Through study completion, assessed up to 2 years.
The study for each participant consisted of a Screening period, a Treatment period and a Follow-up period.

In phase I,Six subjects were enrolled in the 1.11 Gbq (30 mCi) group of \[177Lu\] Lu-XT033 Injection. The last subject in this group completed the 4-week observation period after the first dose, With the consent of the Safety Monitoring Committee (SRC), 6 subjects were enrolled in the 1.85 Gbq (50 mCi) group. Both groups used 8 ± 1 weeks as the dosing interval for a total of 4 doses.In phase II,Subjects who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were treated with \[177Lu\] Lu-XT033 injection at the recommended phase II dose（RP2D）.After Cycle 4 treatment and prior to Cycle 5 treatment, the investigator assessed the following criteria to determine whether:

The patient showed evidence of response (i.e. radiological, PSA, clinical benefit)

The patient had signs of residual disease on CT with contrast/MRI or bone scan

The patient had shown good tolerance to the \[177Lu\] Lu-XT033 Injection

If the patient met all of the criteria above and agreed to continue with additional treatment of \[177Lu\] Lu-XT033, the Investigator could administer 2 additional cycles. A maximum of 6 cycles of \[177Lu\] Lu-XT033 as allowed.

All subjects continued to undergo safety, tolerability, and efficacy assessments until the study-specified visit occurred or the subject was lost to follow-up or death whichever came first.
