TRINOVA-1: A Study of AMG 386 or Placebo, in Combination With Weekly Paclitaxel Chemotherapy, as Treatment for Ovarian Cancer, Primary Peritoneal Cancer and Fallopian Tube Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine if treatment with paclitaxel plus AMG 386 is superior to paclitaxel plus placebo in women with recurrent partially platinum sensitive or resistant epithelial ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer or fallopian tube cancer.

AMG 386 is a man-made medication that is designed to stop the development of blood vessels in cancer tissues. Cancer tissues rely on the development of new blood vessels, a process called angiogenesis, to obtain a supply of oxygen and nutrients to grow.
