HA-1 T TCR T Cell Immunotherapy for the Treatment of Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Leukemia After Donor Stem Cell Transplant
This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of CD4+ and CD8+ HA-1 T cell receptor (TCR) (HA-1 T TCR) T cells in treating patients with acute leukemia that persists, has come back (recurrent) or does not respond to treatment (refractory) following donor stem cell transplant. T cell receptor is a special protein on T cells that helps them recognize proteins on other cells including leukemia. HA-1 is a protein that is present on the surface of some peoples' blood cells, including leukemia. HA-1 T cell immunotherapy enables genes to be added to the donor cells to make them recognize HA-1 markers on leukemia cells.

OUTLINE:

This is a dose-escalation study of CD4+ and CD8+ HA-1 TCR T cells.

Patients receive lymphodepleting chemotherapy ending 2-14 days prior to HA-1 TCR T cell administration. Patients then receive CD4+ and CD8+ HA-1 TCR T cells intravenously (IV).

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up closely for 12 weeks and then every 6 months for years 1-5, and every year for years 6-15.
