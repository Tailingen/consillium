Ketogenic Diet Improves Thrombocytopenia in Cancer Patients
The main purpose of this study is to evaluate whether dietary intervention through ketogenic diet can prevent or improve chemotherapy related thrombocytopenia in cancer patients.
Ketogenic Diet
DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Strict ketogenic diet group|DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Cyclic ketogenic diet group|DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Autonomous ketogenesis group
thrombocytopenia, During radiotherapy and chemotherapy, approximately 3 months
In the study, 80 patients with malignant solid tumors undergoing chemotherapy were randomly assigned to the normal diet group, the strict ketogenic diet group, the circulating ketogenic diet group, and the autonomous ketogenic group. During the chemotherapy period, the corresponding dietary intervention was carried out, and the clinical data of patients before and after treatment were collected, including blood routine, blood ketone concentration, weight, blood sugar, blood lipids, adverse events, and changes in platelets before and after chemotherapy, Statistical analysis of data such as the change degree of platelets and the incidence of adverse events in each diet group before and after treatment was carried out to evaluate the impact of ketogenic diet on clinical indicators and adverse reactions of chemotherapy in cancer patients.
