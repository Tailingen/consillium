A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Oral Navelbine in Female Patients With HER2-Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer
This is a randomized, open-label, parallel, multi-center study, aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of metronomic chemotherapy with oral Navelbine versus intermittent oral Navelbine in female patients with HER2 negative Metastasis Breast Cancer.
Human Epidermal Growth Factor 2 Negative Carcinoma of Breast
DRUG: Oral NVB Metronomic|DRUG: Oral NVB Weekly
Disease Control Rate, Disease Control Rate (DCR) is the proportion of subjects who have best overall response of CR + PR + SD with duration of â‰¥6 weeks., 12 weeks
Time to Tumor Progression, Time to Tumor Progression (TTP) is defined as the time from randomization to time of progressive disease., up to 36 months|Time to Treatment Failure, Time to Treatment Failure (TTF) is defined as the time from randomization to treatment discontinuation for any reason, including disease progression, treatment toxicity, patient toxicity, patient preference, or death., up to 36 months|Progression free survival, Progression free survival (PFS) is the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documentation of disease progression, or to the date of death from any case, whichever occurs first., up to 36 months|Overall survival, Overall survival (OS) will be measured from the date of randomization until the date of death from any case., up to 60 months|Adverse events, Adverse events including Serious AEs and non-serious AEs (since ICF signed and until 30 days after last intake of study medication), up to 36 months|Quality of Life (QoL), The FACT-B +4 (Version 4) (Appendix ) QoL questionnaires will be filled in at baseline before randomization, then every 6 weeks during the Randomization Treatment Period and at EoTV. Changes of the scores from baseline of the parameters will be provided from baseline., up to 36 months
1. The significant efficacy and good safety profile of Vinorelbine in the treatment of advanced breast cancer are accepted.
2. Oral NVB presents absolute bioavailability of 40% and oral availability allows to use different schedules and the endothelial cell functionality and motility are interfered at very low drug concentration
3. Oral NVB at 50 mg three times a week (Monday-Wednesday-Friday) has been tested in phase Ia/Ib/II trials, highlighting the excellent safety of this scheme combined with an interesting activity in various European countries.
4. The study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of metronomic chemotherapy with oral Navelbine versus intermittent oral Navelbine in female patients with HER2 negative Metastasis Breast Cancer.
