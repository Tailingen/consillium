Although SCLC is very responsive to initial treatment, most patients relapse with relatively resistant disease.These patients have a median survival of only 4 to 5 months when treated with further systemic therapy. Improvements in therapy for relapsed SCLC are much needed.The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of S1 combination with Anlotinib in patients with small cell lung cancer whose cancer has progression or recurrence after at least one standard chemotherapy.
