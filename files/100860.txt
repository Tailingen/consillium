A Phase Ib / IIA Study of AL8326 in Small Cell Lung Cancer
Based on indicators such as 24 week progression free survival (24 weeks PFS) in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients without disease progression after first-line platinum containing chemotherapy, objective response rate (ORR) in SCLC patients with recurrence or progression after first-line platinum containing chemotherapy, and orr in SCLC patients with recurrence or progression after second-line and above treatment,Evaluation of the effectiveness of al8326 monotherapy in small cell lung cancer.
Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: AL8326 tablets
(Group A) 24 weeks progression free survival (24 weeks PFS), Objective to evaluate the 24 week progression free survival (24 weeks PFS) of AL8326 in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) without disease progression (PR or CR or SD) after first-line platinum based chemotherapy., Every 2 cycles(each cycle is 28--days)|(Group B and C) Objective response rate (ORR), Objective response rate (ORR) of SCLC patients with recurrence or progression after first-line platinum chemotherapy, and objective response rate (ORR) of SCLC patients with recurrence or progression after second-line or above treatment., Every 2 cycles(each cycle is 28--days)
Safety and tolerance(Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0), Objective to evaluate the safety and tolerability of al8326 monotherapy in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) without disease progression (PR or CR or SD) after first-line platinum based chemotherapy; Safety and tolerability in patients with small cell lung cancer who relapsed or progressed after first-line platinum based chemotherapy; Safety and tolerability in patients with small cell lung cancer who relapse or progress after at least second-line treatment (including first-line platinum containing therapy, second-line monotherapy or other treatments)., Every 2 cycles(each cycle is 28--days)
This trial is a multicenter, single arm, open label, nonrandomized, phase Ib / IIA trial that will evaluate the preliminary efficacy and safety of AL8326 in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC).Three treatment groups were used in this trial, and the study population, sample size, and basic design of each group were as follows:

Group A: Patients with small-cell lung cancer without disease progression (in remission \[PR or Cr\] or stable disease \[SD\] status) after first-line platinum containing chemotherapy were included, with a total sample size expected to be 79 patients.

Group B: Patients who relapsed or progressed after first-line platinum containing chemotherapy regimens, with a total sample size expected to be 79 patients.

Group C: Patients with small cell lung cancer who have relapsed or progressed after at least one line of treatment (including first-line platinum containing therapy, second-line single agent or other) with a total sample size expected to be 79 patients.
