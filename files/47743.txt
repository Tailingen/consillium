Randomized Phase III Study of Folfiri+Avastin Versus Xeliri+Avastin as 1st Line Treatment of CRC
This phase III study will compare two combinations of irinotecan, Folfiri versus Xeliri, with the addition of Avastin as 1st line treatment of colorectal cancer.
Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Irinotecan|DRUG: 5-Fluorouracil|DRUG: Leucovorin|DRUG: Capecitabine|DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Irinotecan
Time To Progression, 1 year
Objective Response Rate, Objective responses confirmed by CT or MRI (on 3rd and 6th cycle)|Overall Survival, Probability of 1-year survival (%)|Toxicity profile, Toxicity assessment on each chemotherapy cycle|Quality of life, Assessment every two cycles|Symptoms improvement, Assessment every two cycles
There is no data of comparison for Folfiri and Xeliri regimens. The reported data demonstrated that the addition of Avastin in the combination of irinotecan/bolus 5-FU/LV has significant improvement of overall survival. Further analysis of these results showed that patients receiving irinotecan in combination with Avastin, as 1st line treatment and oxaliplatin with Avastin, as second line treatment, have median overall survival 25, 1 months, which is the longest survival that has been reported.
