Agreement Between Oral and Cervical Human Papillomavirus Infection in a French Cohort
Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are the most common of sexually transmitted viral agents and they are associated with genital and oral diseases.

Agreement between cervical and oral HPV infection has been described from a small group of patient. Our study, performed on a greater number of patients, will provide a good estimation of this link, between cervical and oral infection, in a French population of women with a primary cervical HPV infection.

OTHER: Agreement between oral and cervical HPV infection
Agreement between oral and cervical HPV infection, Agreement between oral and cervical HPV infection is defined by the presence of at least one identical genotype HPV in both sites in the same wife. All genotypes found in the oral and cervical area will be considered., up to 6 months
Agreement between full and partial oral and cervical HPV genotypes, Agreement between oral and cervical HPV genotypes is considered as complete if the same HPV genotypes were detected on both sites. Agreement between oral and cervical HPV genotypes is considered as partial when at least one but not all HPV genotypes were detected at both sites., up to 6 months|Proportion of women with oral HPV infection in women with primary cervical HPV infection, up to 6 months|Proportion of women with oral high risk HPV infection, up to 6 months|Description of all HPV genotypes found in women with HPV infection at both sites, All genotypes found in the oral and cervical area will be described., up to 6 months|Oral HPV risk factors, The following oral HPV risk factors will be analyzed: smoking, regular alcohol consumption, number of sexual partners, sexual risk behaviors., up to 6 months|Persistence and clearance of oral HPV infection, The persistence of HPV infection will be defined by the detection of the same genotype of oral HPV between the two tests.

The clearance of HPV infection will be defined by a positive oral HPV infection at baseline and a negative oral HPV infection up to 18 months., up to 18 months|Frequency of newly positive women with oral HPV infection, Women with no HPV infection at baseline and positive HPV infection at 18 months will be considered as newly positive women., up to 18 months
