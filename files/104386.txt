Observational Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Bortezomib, Melphalan, Prednisone (VMP) in Participants With Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of this study is to assess the 2-year progression-free survival rate.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Bortezomib|DRUG: Melphalan|DRUG: Prednisone
2-year Progression-free Survival Rate, Progression-free survival rate: the length of time from the day when Bortezomib was first administered to disease progression or death, whichever comes first, in 2 years., Up to 2 years
Time to Response, Time from the first day of Bortezomib administration to the day of confirmed first response in participants with confirmed response, or to the day of loss to follow-up, disease progression, death or completion of study therapy in participants without response., up to 2 years|Overall Response Rate, Percentage of participants who achieved CR, VGPR or PR in 2 years., up to 2 years|Complete Response Rate, Percentage of participants who achieved CR as best response., up to 2 years|Time to Next therapy, The next therapy after the end of the study therapy was investigated, and the time from the day when the first therapy was started to the day when the next therapy was started was calculated., up to 2 years|Time to Disease Progression, Time from the first day of Bortezomib administration to the day of disease progression or relapse from complete response, whichever comes first., up to 2 years
This was a prospective, open-label, multicenter, observational study. Participants who received bortezomib, Melphalan, Prednisone(VMP) therapy for Multiple myeloma (MM) that was not eligible for autologous stem cell transplantation will be enrolled in the study. The study will consist of Screening phase; VMP therapy phase (9cycles); Follow-up phase (2 years from the day when the first cycle was started). Participants visited each institution for evaluation for 2 years from the date of baseline evaluation and first VMP administration (duration of treatment, 9 cycles; follow-up visits, every 3 months after the end of the treatment). Participants receiving VMP therapy will be primarily evaluated for 2-year progression-free survival rate. Participants safety will be monitored throughout the study.
