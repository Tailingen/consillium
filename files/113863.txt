Comparing the Efficacy of Surgery Staging and Image Staging of Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer
The study is a domestic multicenter, prospective, non-randomized controlled concurrent trial. It will be assessed whether surgery staging on locally advanced cervical cancer is superior to image staging for improving progression-free survival and overall survival.
Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer
RADIATION: Concurrent chemoradiation|PROCEDURE: Open/minimally invasive para-aortic lymph node dissection followed by concurrent chemoradiation
PFS, Progression-free survival, 3 years
OS, 3-year and 5-year Overall Survival, 3 years and 5 years|Complication, Some conditions caused by surgery or chemoradiation., 1 year
All eligible patients will be divided into the following two treatment groups nonrandomly.

Image staging group: standard chemoradiation (Pelvic EBRT/Extended-field EBRT + concurrent platinum-containing chemotherapy+brachytherapy).

Surgery staging group: open/minimally invasive para-aortic lymph node dissection followed by concurrent chemoradiation. (Level of lymph node dissection: At least the inferior mesenteric artery. Chemoradiation will be conducted within 28 days postoperatively.)
