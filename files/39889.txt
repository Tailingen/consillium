Rh-Endostatin Combined With CCRT(50 Gy) Followed by Durvalumab Maintenance for the Treatment of Specific Phase III NSCLC
A Study to Assess the Effects of Durvalumab following Rh-Endostatin combined with reduced-dose CCRT(50 Gy) in Patients with Stage III Unresectable Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer who can not tolerate 60 Gy irradiation.
Lung Cancer
DRUG: Recombinant human endostatin (Endostar)|RADIATION: Thoracic irradiation of 50 Gy with 3DCRT or IMRT
Progression Free Survival, PFS was defined as the time from randomization until the date of objective disease progression (RECIST 1.1) or death (by any cause in the absence of progression)., up to approximately 3 years|adverse events (AE), Number of participants with adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, 5 years from patient enrollment
Overall Survival, OS was defined as the time from the date of randomization until death due to any cause. OS was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier technique., up to 5 years from patient enrollment|Objective Response Rate, ORR was defined as the percentage of patients with at least one visit response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) per RECIST 1.1 for target lesions: CR: Disappearance of all target lesions; PR: \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; OR = CR + PR., Tumor scans performed at baseline then every ~8 weeks up to 48 weeks, then every ~ 12 weeks thereafter up to 3 three years
A Phase II, Single-arm, Multi-centre Study of Durvalumab as Sequential Therapy in Patients with Locally Advanced, Unresectable Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (Stage III) Who Have Not Progressed Following Rh-Endostatin combined with reduced-dose CCRT(50 Gy) Therapy (Relief)
