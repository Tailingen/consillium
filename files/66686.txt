IS-002 Phase 2 Prostate Cancer Study
Phase 2 randomized controlled multi-center study of IS-002, in conjunction with near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging, for identification of prostate cancer during robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) with (extended) pelvic lymph node dissection ((e)PLND) using the da Vinci® X/Xi Surgical System with Firefly® Fluorescence Imaging.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Administration of IS-002|DEVICE: Firefly fluorescent imaging|PROCEDURE: robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection
The proportion of subjects with ≥1 positive surgical margins (PSMs) on final histopathologic assessment in the Intervention arm and the Control arm., The proportion of subjects with ≥1 PSMs on final histopathologic assessment in the Intervention arm and the Control arm., Within 3 months post-surgery|The mean number of positive surgical margins (PSMs) on final histopathologic assessment in the Intervention arm and the Control arm., The mean number of PSMs on final histopathologic assessment in the Intervention arm and the Control arm., Within 3 months post-surgery
Diagnostic performance of IS-002 fluorescence, The key secondary outcome is the determination of false-positive, true-positive, false-negative and true-negatives rates., Up to 1 year post-surgery|Safety: Adverse event assessment, Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events from time of IS-002 administration through study exit using CTCAE v5.0, Up to 1 year post-surgery|Pharmacokinetics: Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from time zero to the time of the last measurable concentration as calculated by linear up/log down trapezoidal method (AUC0-last), Up to 24 hours post-IS-002 administration|Time to biochemical recurrence (BCR), Time to BCR in the Intervention arm and the Control arm. BCR is defined a PSA level \>0.1 ng/mL as determined by an ultrasensitive PSA assay., Up to 1 year post-surgery|Time to secondary treatment initiation, Time to secondary treatment(s) for prostate cancer in the Intervention arm and the Control arm., Up to 1 year post-surgery|Number of intraoperative fluorescent lymph nodes that are tumor positive that would not have been resected if the surgeon would have had access to white light imaging only, In the Intervention arm, the number of intraoperative fluorescent lymph nodes, per subject and per lymph node basin, that are tumor positive that would not have been resected if the surgeon would have had access to white light imaging only., Up to 3 months post surgery
