Change in participants physical capacity, as represented by hand grip strength, Previous studies have demonstrated that grip strength is a predictor of surgical outcomes and mortality in cancer participants. Grip strength will be measured utilizing the Jamar Dynamometer., 3 weeks after the surgery
Mortality Rate, Death due to any cause postoperatively., Up to 90 days after the surgery|Morbidity rate, Classified according to the Clavien-Dindo Classification of postoperative complications., Up to 90 days after the surgery|Physical capacity as represented by 30s CST (Chair Stand Test ), Participants rise to full standing position from sitting in a chair as many times as possible within 30 seconds. The 30s CST has been utilized as a reliable test of lower extremity strength., 3 weeks after the surgery|Physical capacity as represented by 6-Minute Walk Test, Participants will walk as far as possible in 6 min at a comfortable pace but do not run or jog. If participants cannot complete the full 6 min walk, then record the time and distance walked and the reason for stopping early., 3 weeks after the surgery
Frailty is independently associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes after major surgery, including pancreatic resection. Prehabilitation aims to optimize modifiable risk factors to improve participants' baseline health prior to surgery. Multiple studies with participants undergoing pancreatic surgery have investigated the impact of prehabilitation on preoperative health metrics as well as postoperative outcomes. The majority of these studies focused only on exercise; if nutritional and/or psychological status were assessed, these dimensions were not intervened upon in prehabilitation regimens or reassessed postoperatively. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) is designed to assess the impact of physical and nutritional prehabilitation on participants' perioperative condition for those undergoing pancreatic resection for diagnosed or suspected pancreatic and periampullary neoplasms.
