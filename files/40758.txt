An Observational Study to Learn More About NTRK Gene Fusion Positive in Solid Tumor in Japan
This is an observational study in which data from the past of people with solid tumors harboring an NTRK gene fusion in Japan are studied. In observational studies, only observations are made without specified advice or interventions.

Advanced or recurrent solid tumor harboring an NTRK gene fusion is a rare type of solid cancer caused by specific changes in the genes called NTRK gene fusion, and which has spread to nearby tissues and/or lymph nodes or has returned. Due to this change in the gene, an altered protein known as a TRK fusion protein is made, which can cause cancer cells to grow and survive.

The main purpose of this study is to learn more about NTRK gene fusion in people in Japan. To do this, researchers will collect information on the number or percentage of Japanese people with NTRK gene fusion in any solid tumor.

The data will come from the national database called C-CAT. They will cover the period from June 2019 until January 2023.

Besides this data collection, no further tests or examinations are planned, and no visits are required in this study.
