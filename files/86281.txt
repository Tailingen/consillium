Combination Pembrolizumab, Chemotherapy and Bevacizumab in Patients With Cervical Cancer
The investigators propose to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of standard chemotherapy with bevacizumab with Pembrolizumab in women with recurrent, persistent, or metastatic cervical cancer.
Cervical Cancer
DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Bevacizumab
Objective Response (OR), Objective response defined as the percentage of patients showing complete or partial response to study therapy. Response to therapy will be evaluated using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1)., Up to 24 months
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as percentage of participants without disease progression at time of study discontinuation will be assessed., Up to 24 months|Overall Survival (OS), The rate of Overall Survival (OS) in study participants at 24 months will be reported. OS is defined as the time from the date of start of treatment until date of death due to any cause or date of last known to be alive. The estimate of OS rate at the 24 months is calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method, which takes into account the censored event-free times., Up to 24 months|Number of Participants Experiencing Treatment-Related Toxicity, The number of study participants experiencing treatment-related toxicity, including adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), will be assessed. Treatment-related AEs and SAEs will be evaluated with respect to grade and relationship to treatment, using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), Version 4.03., Up to 15 months
