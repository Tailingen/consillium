Anlotinib and Irinotecan for Ewing Sarcoma
The investigators explored the activity of anlotinib combined with irinotecan in patients with relapsed and metastatic Ewing Sarcoma.

After standard multimodal therapy, the prognosis of relapsed and metastatic Ewing Sarcoma is dismal and unchanged over the last decades.Thus, the investigators explored the activity of anlotinib combined with irinotecan in patients with relapsed and metastatic Ewing Sarcoma after the failure of first-line chemotherapy with doxorubicin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, ifosphamide and etoposide.
