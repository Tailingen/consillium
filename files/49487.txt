HER-2 Pulsed DC Vaccine to Prevent Recurrence of Invasive Breast Cancer Post Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
The primary goals of this trial will be to determine the safety and immune activity of HER-2 pulsed DC1 vaccine in patients with high risk HER-2pos breast cancer with residual disease post neoadjuvant therapy. Investigators will also explore the possibility of determining whether circulating tumor cells can be used as surrogate to assess response to vaccination.
Breast Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: HER-2 pulsed Dendritic Cell Vaccine
Participation Compliance, Feasibility: Defined as a patient's ability and willingness to complete the treatment regimen (6 weekly vaccinations). Data collection will include rate of successful completion and occurrence rate for each reason stated for non-completion., Up to 18 months|Occurrence of Treatment Related Adverse Events, Number of participants with treatment related adverse events, per event category., Up to 18 months
Immunogenicity, Immunogenicity will be evaluated by descriptive statistics, plots of pre- and post-treatment values and fold changes. Immune response rate and 95% exact confidence interval will be calculated., Up to 5 years follow-up|Anti-HER2 Immunity, Anti-HER2 response will be quantitated as EOS/baseline fold change in dilution studies., Up to 5 years follow-up
Dendritic cell cancer vaccines combined with chemotherapy may increase complete responses giving breast cancer specific immune cells greater opportunity to function while the immune repertoire is being shifted by chemotherapy to anti-breast cancer response and offer the chance to test secondary prevention of breast cancer in high risk settings. There is a need to determine whether this ICAIT DC1 can activate CD4 and CD8 T cells prior to or in combination with chemotherapy with or without added trastuzumab.

This study began at the Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania and will be continued at H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute.
