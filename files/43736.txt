Immunotherapy Using Autologous T Cell-Engineered With CD19-specific Chimeric Antigen Receptor for the Treatment of Recurrent /Refractory B Cell Leukemia
Objectives:

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and prognosis of New Cluster of Differentiation Antigen 19-chimeric Antigen Receptor T (nCAR19-T) Cells in the treatment of recurrent/refractory B-cell tumor and the Optimal dosage of nCAR19-T cell therapy.

Methods:

This study designs a novel therapy using nCAR19-T. 20 patients will be enrolled. Cyclophosphamide 500 mg - 2000 mg/m2 (day 2) with or without Fludarabine 30 mg/m2 /day, 4 days (day-6,-5,-4,-3); nCAR19-T transfusion：day 0(5×10※5/kg，1×10※6/kg，3×10※6/kg). According to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) standard (CTCAE), they will be observed 24 weeks long. Follow-up survey after the clinical study: within 1 months, once a week; then once a month for 1 years; and then once a year, a total of 15 years.
