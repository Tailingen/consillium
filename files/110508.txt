Effectiveness of Narrow Margins in Patients With Low-Risk Basal Cell Carcinoma Undergoing Surgery
This clinical trial studies the effectiveness of narrow margins in patients with low-risk basal cell carcinoma undergoing surgery to remove skin lesions on the face. A margin is the area of normal tissue around a tumor taken out during surgery to make sure all of the cancer is removed. This clinical trial studies tissue samples to determine the least amount of tissue that must be removed to give an acceptable cure rate. This may allow less normal tissue to be removed from patients and may be a less expensive surgery.
Skin Basal Cell Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: Therapeutic Conventional Surgery
Success rate for 1 mm margins, The success rate for 1 mm margin will be calculated along with an exact one-sided 95% confidence interval for the proportion. The success rate will be compared to a null value of 90% using a one-sided exact test of binomial proportion., Up to 3 years|Success rate for 2 mm margins, The success rate for 2 mm margin will be calculated along with an exact one-sided 95% confidence interval for the proportion. The success rate will be compared to a null value of 90% using a one-sided exact test of binomial proportion., Up to 3 years
Recurrence rate after 3 years, Up to 3 years
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the success rate of narrow margin excisions of low-risk facial basal cell carcinoma (BCC).

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the narrowest excision margin for low-risk facial BCC that gives an acceptable (95%) cure rate over a 3 year follow-up period.
