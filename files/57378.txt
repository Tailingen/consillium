A Study in Healthy Subjects to Assess the Pharmacokinetics of Savolitinib When Administered Alone and in Combination With Rifampicin
This is a phase I, open-label, 3 treatment period, fixed-sequence study in healthy non-Japanese male subjects, aged 18 to 65 years (inclusive), performed at a single study centre. Treatment Period 1 will establish the single dose pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of savolitinib. Dosing of daily rifampicin during Treatment Period 2 will result in maximal induction of the CYP450 enzymes including CYP3A4. Treatment Period 3 will then establish the single dose PK profile of savolitinib under maximum CYP450 induction conditions. Comparison of the PK profile of savolitinib between Treatment Period 1 and Treatment Period 3 will quantify the effect of CYP450 enzyme induction.

The treatment starts with a single dose of savolitinib (Treatment Period 1), followed by a washout period at least of 14 days after savolitinib dosing and before the start of Treatment Period 2, followed by rifampicin administration for 5 days (Treatment Period 2), and lastly, a combination of savolitinib + rifampicin (Treatment Period 3). Overall, all subjects will receive 2 single doses of 600 mg savolitinib and 7 daily doses of 600 mg rifampicin. Subjects will be resident in the study centre when receiving study drug administrations (savolitinib \[Treatment Period 1\], rifampicin \[Treatment Period 2\] and savolitinib+rifampicin \[Treatment Period 3\]). Subjects are required to fast overnight before each dosing day. Rifampicin will be administered 1 hour before breakfast with 240 mL water. The subjects will need to complete high-fat, high calorie breakfast before administration of savolitinib in Treatment Period 1, Day 1 (Study Day 1) and Treatment Period 3 Day 1 (Study Day 20).
