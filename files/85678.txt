Testicular cancer (TC) is diagnosed in young adult males between 18-39 years old. There are late (≥10 years after treatment) atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events after cisplatin-based chemotherapy (CBCT) treatment in testicular cancer survivors (TCS), along with heightened rates of hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and metabolic syndrome. Early detection of ASCVD to direct preventive measures in young TCS is an unmet need as these patients typically fall short of traditional 40-45-year age-cut offs for ASCVD screening. ASCVD risk will be evaluated in TCS ≥ 10 years after treatment in three groups: 1)TCS exposed to CBCT, 2)TCS exposed to CBCT and bone marrow transplant (BMT), and 3)TCS cured with surgical resection/surveillance. The focus will be on detecting subclinical atherosclerosis in TCS using blood lipid biomarkers and advanced cardiac CT imaging.
