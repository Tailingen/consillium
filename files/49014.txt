MCS110 in Patients With Pigmented Villonodular Synovitis (PVNS)
This study, designed as a proof of concept study of MCS110 in pigmented villonodular synovitis, assessed the clinical response to MCS110 treatment in Pigmented Villonodular Synovitis (PVNS) patients, after a single or multiple intravenous doses of MCS110, using magnetic resonance imaging to assess tumor volume, and evaluated the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, safety and tolerability in this population.

Change in Pigmented Villonodular Synovitis (PVNS) Tumor Size, To assess the efficacy of a single i.v. dose of MCS110 in changing the size of PVNS tumors (as compared to baseline) compared to placebo over 4 weeks evaluated by volume of PVNS tumors by 3-dimensional MRI. This analysis includes all data from patients 4 weeks after receiving the first dose of MCS110 (3, 5 or 10 mg/kg) or placebo and assesses the tumor volume changes at week 4 as compared to baseline. As all parts (Part A, B and C) of the study are assessed after a single dose at week 4 the data set is called "ABC4"., Week 4|Percent Change in Pigmented Villonodular Synovitis (PVNS) Tumor Size, To assess the efficacy of a single i.v. dose of MCS110 in percent change of the PVNS tumor volume at week 4 as compared to baseline and compared to placebo evaluated by volume of PVNS tumors by 3-dimensional MRI.

Analysis included data starting from 1st dose of MCS110 in all treatment groups of Parts B and C. Part B patients who received placebo as 1st dose, measurement prior to receiving first dose of MCS110, was used as baseline and assessment time-points were adjusted accordingly. For Part C, participants starting treatment with low dose of MCS110 of 3 or 5 mg/kg could switch to 10 mg/kg after 3 monthly doses, if MCS110 was well tolerated and tumor volume reduction was ≤ 45%.

Serum CTX-I data were generated in Part A and Part B. In Part C, samples were collected for serum bone CTX-I analysis. The analysis was not performed, as enough information on compound mode of action was obtained using creatine kinase (CK) and monocytes (hematology) data. Only data from 10mg/kg (single and multiple doses) are available., Baseline, Week 4, Week 24, Week 104|Number of Participants With Negative Anti-MCS110 Antibody, To assess the immunogenicity of MCS110 in serum anti-MCS110 antibody concentrations, Baseline, throughout the study up to Day 505|Assessment of Change From Baseline in Joint Range of Motion for Knee Extension and Flexion, To assess the clinical response of joint range of motion following a single i.v. dose of MCS110 or placebo as compared to baseline 4 weeks post-dose evaluated in participants, who had a knee tumor, which was the majority of participants (75%).

The data presented are changes from baseline in degree. Participants, who started treatment with a low dose of MCS110 of 3 or 5 mg/kg could switch to 10 mg/kg after 3 monthly doses, if MCS110 was well tolerated and the tumor volume reduction was ≤ 45%. This analysis includes data from participants with knee tumor who received at least 2 doses of MCS110 and thus includes only patients from Part B and C of the study, thus the data set is called "Part BC".

Data presented are changes from baseline in degree. Participants were asked to place a line perpendicular to the VAS line at the point that represented her/his pain intensity. Using a ruler, the score was determined by measuring the distance (mm) on the 10-cm line between the "no pain" anchor and the participants mark, providing a score from 0-100.

To be considered a relapse tumor volume had to increase greater than 50% of the difference between tumor volume at baseline and the lowest tumor volume measured by MRI. In this assessment the Part B and Part C patients were analyzed separately. N/A (not available):Data analysis not performed as sample size was not analyzable as no patient had surgery/relapse., Up to Week 104|Time to Surgery, Time to surgery describes the time frame from baseline to the time point when participants had surgical removement of PVNS tumor.

Thus, in Part B, the monocyte sample collection was discontinued., Baseline Up to Week 104|Change From Baseline Per Treatment for Activities of Daily Living (ADL) in the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), The KOOS is a patient-reported outcome measurement instrument developed to assess the subject's opinion about their knee and associated problems. The KOOS questionnaire collected data on 5 knee-specific patient-centered outcomes: activities of daily life (ADL), knee related quality of life (QOL), pain and discomfort, sport/recreation, symptoms. The 5 KOOS sub-scales were scored separately on a Likert scale scored from 0 (no problems) to 4 (extreme problems) and scores were transformed to a 0.100 scale with 0 representing extreme knee problems and 100 representing no problems. The 5 dimensions were analyzed independently. Positive changes (i.e. increases in the score) are beneficial.
