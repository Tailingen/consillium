Early Salvage Therapy for Patients With Advanced Features for Biochemical Relapse After Radical Prostatectomy for Localized Prostate Carcinoma In Correlation With Supposed Molecular-genetic Parameters of Higher Aggressiveness
The primary objective of the trial is to compare the impact and safety of delayed salvage therapy (dSRT, i.e., SRT initiated at PSA values of 0.4-0.5 ng/ml) to those of early salvage therapy (eSRT, i.e., at PSA levels of 0.2 ng/ml) in patients with biochemical relapse after radical prostatectomy.

The secondary objective of the trial is to perform analysis of the subgroups of patients to determine which patients are most likely to benefit from dSRT

Exploratory objective of the trial is to determine whether selected molecular genetic parameters (172 candidate genes and molecular alterations) and known clinical parameters can be used to identify potential predictors of worse prognosis in patients with known risk factors for relapse after radical prostatectomy, thereby augmenting and refining patient stratification, optimizing their therapy, and clarifying the proper timing of multimodal therapy
Prostate Cancer
RADIATION: Early salvage radiotherapy (eSRT)|RADIATION: Delayed Salvage radiotherapy (dSRT)
Event-free survival (EFS), Defined as a time to re-documented biochemical relapse after salvage therapy (bRFS), demonstration of clinical relapse (i.e.,local relapse /lRFS/, locoregional relapse /lrRFS/, distant relapse /MFS/) and/or death from any cause., Analysed 3 years after randomisation of the last patient.
Carcinoma-specific survival (CSS), Analysed 5/10 years after randomization of the last patient.|Overall survival (5y- and 10y- OS), Analysed 5/10 years after randomization of the last patient.|Incidence of treatment-related acute and late toxicity, Comparison of the incidence of treatment-related acute and late toxicity between patients after early/ delayed salvage therapy.

Acute and late toxicity will be assessed and graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)., Analysed 5 years after randomization of the last patient.|Health-related quality of life (QoL) assessment., The analysis of the QoL of both study ARMs will be made based on EORTC validated questionnaires (QLQ-C30 and QLQ-PR25).

QLQ-C30 was developed by the EORTC, this self-reported questionnaire assesses the health-related quality of life of cancer patients in clinical trials. The questionnaire includes five functional scales (physical, everyday activity, cognitive, emotional, and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting), a health/quality of life overall scale, and a number of additional elements assessing common symptoms (including dyspnea, loss of appetite, insomnia, constipation, and diarrhea), as well as, the perceived financial impact of the disease. The EORTC QLQ-PR25 is used in conjunction with the EORTC QLQ-C30 and provides information on an additional 25 items specifically related to prostate cancer., Analysed 5 years after randomization of the last patient.
