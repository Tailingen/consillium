A Study of SBRT in Combination With rhGM-CSF for Stage IV NSCLC Patients Who Failed in Second-line Chemotherapy
The purpose of this study is to determine whether stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) combined with recombined human granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor(rhGM-CSF) is safe, effective in the treatment of stage IV NSCLC patients who failed in second-line chemotherapy.

Total T cells count in peripheral blood, To assess the absolute number of T cells in per milliliter peripheral blood pre- and post-therapy., pre-treatment,1, 2, 3, 6, 12 months after completion of rhGM-CSF|Absolute number of CD4+T, CD8+T and regulatory T cells, To assess ratio of effector T cells: regulatory T cells in per milliliter peripheral blood pre- and post-therapy., pre-treatment,1, 2, 3, 6, 12 months after completion of rhGM-CSF
Metastasis lesion will be treated with a SBRT of 50Gy/5F from day 1 to day 5 in one cycle.Subcutaneous injection of human recombined granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (125ug/mÂ² per day) will be executed from day 1 to day 14 in this cycle. Another metastasis lesion will be treated likewise concurrently with rhGM-CSF in a consecutive cycle. Efficacy evaluation,especially abscopal effect evaluation, will be conducted at the end of therapy and every month after that. Adverse events will be recorded according to NCI-CTC version 4.03.
