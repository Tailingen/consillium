Evaluation of a PREHABilitation Protocol Using Adapted Physical Activity (APA) for Multiple Myeloma Patients Eligible for Intensive Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation Treatment
Adapted physical activity for patients with haematological malignancies generally has positive effects on quality of life, fatigue and physical condition. However, some studies show little or no effect.

This may be explained by inefficient protocols, but also by low rates of patient acceptability regarding the proposed exercises.

The multiplicity of APA protocols and the fluctuation of their results mean that validity, methodology and effects on patients need to be verified before they can be considered for implementation in healthcare services. A program must prove its feasibility, but patients must also adhere to it.

Acceptability can be measured by adherence, which represents the number of validated sessions in relation to the number of planned sessions, and by attrition, which corresponds to the number of stops or drop-outs for any reason. The various APA programs offered in the context of intensive auto or allograft treatment are limited, notably by adherence, which can fall by as much as 24%, and attrition, which can be as high as 67%. Optimization of the proposed exercises and follow-up methods is therefore necessary in order to propose an APA program that will be feasible, effective and acceptable to a maximum number of patients.

To meet these objectives for patients with multiple myeloma eligible for autologous stem cell transplantation, the protocol for this study took into consideration the various recommendations of previous publications and the guidelines from HAS (French National Authority for Health).

The ultimate goal of this study is to validate, in terms of effectiveness and acceptability, the methodology and in particular the use of new specific tools for optimizing an APA program. It will subsequently be offered to all patients with multiple myeloma eligible for autologous stem cell transplantation, independently of their age or physical condition, while respecting their rhythm and physical condition.
