Transvaginal Ultrasound in Women With Abnormal Uterine Bleeding
The objective of this study is to investigate the role of transvaginal ultrasound in detecting endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer in women aged more than 35 presenting with abnormal uterine bleeding.
Abnormal Uterine Bleeding
DEVICE: Transvaginal sonography
The accuracy of endometrial thickness and endometrial pattern detected by transvaginal ultrasound in predicting endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer., The endometrial thickness will be measured in millimeter, at the mid-sagittal plane of the uterus, near the uterine fundus. The measurement will be performed 3 times, from basal layer of the anterior to basal layer of the posterior wall of uterine cavity. The average value of 3 measurements will be used for statistical analysis.

The endometrial patterns are categorized into 3 groups:

1. Triple-layer appearance
2. Mixed echogenic pattern
3. Hyper-echogenic pattern, 14 months
To identify the cut-off points of endometrial thickness that can differentiate normal endometrial pathology and endometrial hyperplasia/endometrial cancer., The results of endometrial thickness will be compared with the endometrial pathologies.The cut-off points of endometrial thickness, in millimeter, that can differentiate normal endometrial pathology and endometrial hyperplasia/endometrial cancer will be analyzed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve., 14 months
To study the prevalence of the various causes of abnormal uterine bleeding in premenopausal women aged more than 35, 14 months
The objective of this study is to investigate the role of transvaginal ultrasound in detecting endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer in women aged more than 35 presenting with abnormal uterine bleeding.
