Prospective Database of Gastrointestinal Stromal Cell Tumors (GISTs)
Specific Aim 1: To determine patient compliance with a GIST surveillance program Hypothesis: Patient compliance with a GIST surveillance program will be low.

Specific Aim 2: To determine if EUS features of GIST, particularly maximum size, change significantly during a surveillance program.

Hypothesis: EUS features of GIST, particularly maximum size, will not change significantly during a surveillance program.

Specific Aim 3: To determine if EGD measures of GIST size correlate well with EUS measures of GIST size.

Hypothesis: EGD measures of GIST size will correlate well with EUS measured of GIST size.
