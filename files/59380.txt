Trabectedin, Doxorubicin and Olaratumab in Patients With Metastatic or Recurrent Leiomyosarcoma
This study seeks to determine if addition of trabectedin (T) to combination doxorubicin (D) and olaratumab (O), is feasible and tolerable with antitumor activity in metastatic or recurrent Leiomyosarcomas (LMS) patients who have limited therapeutic options.
Leiomyosarcoma
DRUG: Trabectedin|DRUG: Doxorubicin|DRUG: Olaratumab
Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of Trabectedin in Combination with Doxorubucin and Olaratumab, Determination of the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of Trabectedin \[T\] to be used in combination with Doxorubicin \[D\] and Olaratumab \[O\] for the treatment of patients with metastatic or recurrent LMS. Patients will be treated at one of 4-6 dose levels according to the standard dose escalation/de-escalation scheme. In accordance with this scheme, the RP2D of TDO will be established as the highest dose level tested for which no more than 2 out of 12 patients experiences dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)., About 21 days, one cycle of protocol therapy
Toxicity in Study Participants, Determination of the safety, tolerability, and toxicity profile of administering TDO in metastatic or recurrent LMS patients, including assessment of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs)., Up to 8 months|Clinical Benefit Rate in Study Participants, Clinical benefit rate (CBR), as defined by best response, (Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR) or Stable Disease (SD)) will be assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria version 1.1., From Baseline to End of Treatment, up to 8 months
This is a traditional 3+3 phase I trial design to identify the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of Trabectedin \[T\] that can be used in combination with Doxorubicin \[D\] and Olaratumab \[O\] for the treatment of patients with advanced stage or recurrent LMS.

Patients will be treated at an assigned dose level of combination therapy per dose escalation design.
