Brentuximab Vedotin in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory EBV-and CD30-positive Lymphomas
This is an open-label, non-randomized, multi-center, phase II trial of brentuximab vedotin to evaluate ORR primarily in patients with EBV- and CD30-positive lymphomas.
Relapsed or Refractory EBV-and CD30-positive Lymphomas
DRUG: brentuximab vedotin
To Evaluate the Overall Response Rate (ORR) of Brentuximab Vedotin in EBV- and CD30-positive Lymphomas, The primary endpoint was the ORR based on the revised criteria or modified Severity Weighted Assessment Tool (SWAT) criteria in the case of cutaneous lymphomas., One-year
To Evaluate the Safety Profile, AEs/SAEs occurring during the study period defined by CTCAE version 4.03, From the first dose of brentuximab vedotin to up to 30 days after the last dose, a total of up to approximately 366 days|To Calculate Progression-free Survival (PFS) Time, PFS as defined as the time from the date of initiation until the date of first documented progression.

Revised tumor response criteria for lymphoma(Revised Cheson) or revised SWAT and assessed by MRI except a pregnant patient whose response evaluation can be assessed by CT scan: Progression is defined using these criteria, as observation of a new lesion or an increase of 50% or more from the nadir in a previously involved site., One-year|To Calculate the Duration of Response, The duration of response was assessed in 12 patients who had objective responses. The response continued even after the completion of the planned 16 cycles of brentuximab vedotin administration in three of these 12 patients (25%) at the time of data cut-off., From the first dose Up to the time of data cut-off.|To Calculate Overall Survival (OS) Time, OS as defined as the time from the date of first dose until death due to any cause.

The median overall survival was obtained, but the upper value of 95% Confidence Interval was not reached at the time of data cut-off. Therefore the longest OS was 30.4 months, the follow-up duration up to the date of data cut-off., From first dose to end of data collection
The Number of Participants With a Tumor Response Stratified by CD30-positive Expression, Exploratory. The level of soluble CD30 (sCD30) was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay., One-year|Exploratory., The level of soluble CD30 (sCD30) was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The specimen were collected on the date of screening visit., On the date of screening visit.|The ORR in the Groups With High sCD30 (≥ 99.03 ng/mL) and Low sCD30 (<99.03 ng/mL)., The ORR in the groups with high sCD30 (≥ 99.03 ng/mL) and low sCD30 (\<99.03 ng/mL) were determined up to the date of data cut-off., Up to the date of data cut-off
This is an open-label, non-randomized, multi-center, phase II trial of brentuximab vedotin to evaluate ORR primarily in patients with EBV- and CD30-positive lymphomas. The ORR will be evaluated based on the revised Cheson's criteria or modified SWAT criteria in case of cutaneous EBV- and CD30-positive lymphomas.
