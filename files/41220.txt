Evaluation of Iron Supplementation During Darbepoetin Alfa Treatment in Prophylaxis of Severe Anaemia Chemo-Induced
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the response rate obtained in an heterogeneous oncologic population treated by chemotherapy, and either by Darbepoetin alfa classic treatment or by association of Darbepoetin alfa -ferric saccharose systematic supplementation, administered concomitantly with chemotherapy.
Neoplasms|Anemia
DRUG: Darbepoetin alfa (Aranesp速)|DRUG: Ferric saccharose(Venofer速)
Biological response rate for each group.
To determine tolerance for ferric saccharose (Venofer速)|To determine percentage of patients who necessitate an increase of Darbepoetin alfa's dose(Aranesp速)|To determine percentage of hemoglobin rate's correction|To determine biological parameters's evolution
