Study of Prednisone, Vinblastine, Doxorubicin, and Gemcitabine in Elderly Patients With Advanced Stages Hodgkin's Lymphoma
The objectives of this study are to assess the feasibility and efficacy of a combination chemotherapy (PVAG) in elderly patients with advanced stages Hodgkin's lymphoma.
Hodgkin's Disease
DRUG: Prednisone|DRUG: Vinblastine|DRUG: Doxorubicin (Adriamycin)|DRUG: Gemcitabine
Phase I: Dose-limiting toxicities and dose reductions|Phase II: Treatment administration and complete response rate
Toxicities|Supportive care (RBCT need, antibiotic need)|Early progression rate|Overall survival
Gemcitabine shows promising activity in patients with relapsed lymphoma either administered as single agent or in combination with other cytotoxic agents. No trial to date evaluated its role in patients with primary Hodgkin's lymphoma. We therefore developed a three-weekly regimen based on the standard ABVD regimen.
