Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: LY2523355|DRUG: Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)
Part A: Percentage of Participants Achieving an Overall Response (Overall Response Rate), The overall response is complete response (CR) + partial response (PR) as classified by the investigators according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines. CR is the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions; PR is a ≥30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions. The overall response rate is calculated as a total number of participants with CR or PR, then divided by the total number of participants treated, then multiplied by 100., Date of enrollment to date of measured progressive disease up to 99.6 weeks|Part B: Percentage of Participants Achieving a Best Response (Clinical Benefit Rate), Clinical benefit rate is complete response (CR) + partial response (PR) + stable disease (SD) as classified by the investigator according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines. CR is the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions; PR is a ≥30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions. SD is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease. Clinical benefit rate is calculated as a total number of participants with CR or PR or SD divided by the total number of participants treated, then multiplied by 100., Date of enrollment to date of measured progressive disease up to 18.1 weeks
Part A: Progression-Free Survival, Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the date of enrollment (first treatment dose) to the first observation of progression of disease (PD) or death due to any cause. PD was determined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. PD is a ≥20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions and/or a new lesion. For participants who had no PD or death or starting new anti-cancer therapy, PFS was censored at their last radiological tumor assessment., Date of enrollment to date of measured progressive disease or date of death from any cause up to 99.6 weeks|Part B: Progression-Free Survival, Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the date of enrollment (first treatment dose) to the first observation of progression of disease (PD) or death due to any cause. PD was determined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. PD is a ≥20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions and/or a new lesion.

The overall response rate is calculated as a total number of participants with CR or PR divided by the total number of participants treated, then multiplied by 100., Date of enrollment to date of measured progressive disease up to 18.1 weeks|Part A: Pharmacokinetics - Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of LY2523355 and Its Metabolite (LSN2546307), Days 1,5 and 9 of Cycle 1 (21-day cycle)|Part B: Pharmacokinetics - Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of LY2523355, Day 3 of Cycle 1 (21-day cycle)|Part A: Pharmacokinetics - Area Under the Plasma Concentration Versus Time Curve of LY2523355 From Time Zero to Infinity [AUC(0-∞)], Due to the very limited pharmacokinetic sampling employed in Part A of the study, the AUC(0-∞) of LY2523355 could not be accurately calculated., Days 1,5 and 9 of Cycle 1 (21-day cycle)|Part B: Pharmacokinetics - Area Under the Plasma Concentration Versus Time Curve of LY2523355 From Time Zero to Infinity [AUC(0-∞)], Day 3 of Cycle 1 (21-day cycle)|Total Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS) and Average Symptom Burden Index (ASBI), LCSS is a 9-item questionnaire. Six questions are symptom-specific measures for lung cancer (appetite, fatigue, cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis and pain), and 3 summation items describe total symptomatic distress, activity status, and overall quality of life. Participant responses were measured using visual analogue scales (VAS) with 100-milliliter (mm) lines. The LCSS total score was defined as the mean of the 9 items of the scale, with scores range from 0 (for best outcome) to 100 (for worst outcome). ASBI was calculated as the mean of six symptom-specific questions from the LCSS, with scores range from 0 (for best outcome) to 100 (for worst outcome)., Baseline and follow-up up to 104 weeks after the first dose of study drug
