Patient Perspectives in Squamous Cell Carcinoma Clinical Trials
Clinical research participation has historically been heavily biased toward specific demographics.

This study will invite several participants to gather a wide range of information on clinical trial experiences for squamous cell carcinoma patients. The aim of the study is to identify the factors that limit the ability of a person to enroll in, as well as complete a clinical trial for treatment of squamous cell carcinoma.

People with squamous cell carcinoma who are invited to take part in clinical research will benefit from the analysis of the data.
