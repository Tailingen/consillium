Feasibility and Tolerance of Nivolumab Neoadjuvant Immunotherapy in High Risk HPV Driven Oropharynx Cancer
The aim of this research is to study the feasibility of neoadjuvant treatment before chemoradiation in "high risk" HPV-driven Oropharynx cancer
Oropharynx Cancer
DRUG: Nivolumab|RADIATION: Chemoradiation
The rate of patients that fulfill the 3 or 5 conditions as described below (Feasibility assessment of nivolumab neoadjuvant treatment before chemoradiation), the rate of patients :

(1) who can receive the 2 nivolumab infusions planned at D1 and between D14 to D16 among patients in the experimental arm And (2) who can receive chemoradiation at D30 (-2 /+7) after the second nivolumab infusion, without delay of more than 7 days with respect to the planned start of chemoradiation (RT-CT) among patients in the experimental arm And (3) with no radiotherapy break of one week or more, among patients in the experimental arm and patients in the control arm separately And (4) with minimal dose of radiotherapy (dose received \>95% of theoretical dose) among patients in the experimental arm and patients in the control arm separately And (5) with minimal dose of chemotherapy of ≥200 mg/m² of cisplatin (CDDP) among patients in the experimental arm and patients in the control arm separately, Between baseline and until 3 months (at the end of chemoradiation)
The incidence of Adverse Events related or not related to chemoradiation and Nivolumab, Acute and delayed toxicities assessed according to national cancer institute (NCI) common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) version 5.0, During treatment phase and until 90 days after the last fraction of radiotherapy|Objective Response Rate in the experimental arm, Radiological response will be assessed according to RECIST 1.1., Between baseline and up to 17 days after the second infusion of nivolumab|Tumor Response in both arms, Radiological response will be assessed according to RECIST 1.1., Between baseline and 3 months after the end of chemoradiation|Overall Survival (OS), the time from randomization to death from any cause, Between baseline and 2 years after the end of chemoradiation|Locoregional control (LRC), the absence of disease progression (radiological progression according to RECIST 1.1 or clinical progression) or recurrence at the site of the primary tumor and loco-regional lymph nodes., Between baseline and 2 years after the end of chemoradiation|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), The time from randomization to progression or death from any cause, Between baseline and 2 years after the end of chemoradiation|Objective Response Rate in the experimental arm, Standardized uptake value (SUV) evolution will be assessed by positron emission tomography (PET)-scan., Between baseline and up to 17 days after the second infusion of nivolumab|Tumor Response in both arms, SUV evolution will be assessed by PET-scan., Between baseline and 3 months after the end of chemoradiation
Methodology:

Patient screened wil be randomized 2:1 between 2 arms:

* Experimental arm: Nivolumab 2 infusions (2 weeks part) before standard of care chemoradiation for 7 weeks with cisplatin at week 1, 4, and 7
* Control arm: Standard of care chemoradiation for 7 weeks with cisplatin at week 1, 4, and 7

Primary Objective:

To assess the feasibility and tolerance of neoadjuvant nivolumab treatment before chemoradiation in "high-risk" HPV-driven Oropharynx Cancer
