A Phase 1B/2 Study of RP1 in Solid Organ Transplant Patients With Advanced Cutaneous Malignancies
This Phase 1B/2 study is a multicenter, open-label, study of RP1 to investigate the (a) objective response rate, in addition to (b) safety and tolerability of RP1 for the treatment of advanced cutaneous malignancies in up to 65 evaluable organ transplant recipients. This will include patients with either previous renal, hepatic, heart, lung, or other solid organ transplantation or hematopoietic cell transplant and experiencing subsequent documented locally advanced or metastatic cutaneous malignancies. The study will enroll a total of 65 evaluable patients. Patients will participate up to approximately 3 years including a 28-day screening period, up to approximately 1 year treatment period, and a 2-year follow-up period.

RP1 is a genetically modified herpes simplex type 1 virus that is designed to directly destroy tumors and to generate an anti-tumor immune response. This is a Phase 1B/2, open label, multicenter, trial evaluating the objective response rate and the safety and tolerability, biodistribution, shedding, and preliminary efficacy of RP1 in adult hepatic, renal, heart, lung, other solid organs, or hematopoietic cell transplant recipients who subsequently experienced advanced or metastatic cutaneous malignancies. Patients will be dosed with RP1 by direct or ultrasound guided intra-tumoral injection into superficial, subcutaneous or nodal tumors. No transplanted organs will be injected.
