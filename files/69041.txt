Feasibility, Acceptability and Preliminary Effects of the Spiritual Care Assessment and Intervention
The purpose of this study is to test a spiritual care intervention for adults with advanced cancer and their caregivers. This intervention will assess 4 areas of spiritual experience: meaning and purpose, relationships, transcendence and peace, self-worth and identity. Participants will be asked to complete questionnaires and participate in 4 sessions with research chaplains.

Several studies have shown that cancer affects multiple dimensions of a patient's life as well as the lives of caregivers and others close to the patient who, when faced with life crises, may use religion and spirituality (R/S) to cope. This study is the first of its kind to incorporate a semi-structured spiritual care and intervention (SCAI) framework into the spiritual care of advanced cancer patients while maintaining proper controls in order to investigate its feasibility, acceptability and potential effects on the emotional and spiritual outcomes of advanced cancer patients and their caregivers. This framework will assess 4 areas of spiritual experience: meaning and purpose, relationships, transcendence and peace, self-worth and identity. Additionally, not only will this study assess acceptability and feasibility of the intervention, it will also track and document coping, satisfaction, anxiety, depression, quality of life outcomes and follow-up with both patient and caregivers following Spiritual Care Assessment and Intervention (SCAI).

Specific Aim 1: To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the SCAI intervention for adults with advanced cancer and their caregivers.

Specific Aim 2: To establish our ability to collect outcome data to support a future efficacy trial for patients and their caregivers in the outpatient clinic and home setting.

Specific Aim 3: To test the preliminary impact of the SCAI intervention on patient and caregiver spiritual wellbeing (primary outcome) and quality of life, religious coping, depression, and anxiety (secondary outcomes)
