A Study of Abemaciclib in Participants With Cancer That is Advanced or Has Spread to Another Part(s) of the Body
This study is known as a "drug interaction study" and is being done to see how abemaciclib may affect the blood levels of a drug mixture of commonly used drugs (caffeine, warfarin, dextromethorphan, and midazolam) when taken in combination with abemaciclib. Each participant will complete screening and four study periods in a fixed sequence, with the option to continue to receive abemaciclib in a safety extension phase. All participants will complete a safety follow-up.
