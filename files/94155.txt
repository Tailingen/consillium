BINGO: Bridging Knowledge, Increasing Awareness
The U.S. population is becoming more diverse, but minority groups are still significantly underrepresented in cancer clinical trials. This disparity limits our understanding of how treatments work across different populations. Efforts like the 21st Century Cures Act aim to improve inclusion, but challenges persist due to historical mistrust and complex barriers in healthcare.

To address these issues, Penn State Health is using a fun and educational approach called "BINGO" to engage the African American/Black community in Dauphin and surrounding counties. Led by the PSCI Diversity Navigator, these BINGO games will provide information about cancer and clinical trials in a relaxed setting. The goal is to build trust, increase awareness, and ultimately improve participation of underrepresented groups in clinical trials.

Through this initiative, they hope to connect participants with needed healthcare services and gather feedback to tailor future trials to community needs. This approach aims to foster collaboration between minority communities and the healthcare system, ensuring that clinical trials reflect the diversity of the population they aim to serve.

Penn State Health is addressing the underrepresentation of minority groups in cancer clinical trials through a community-engagement initiative using a BINGO educational game. Despite efforts like the 21st Century Cures Act, minority participation remains low, impacting the generalizability of trial results and access to novel treatments for diverse populations.

Led by the PSCI Diversity Navigator, this initiative focuses on the African American/Black community in Dauphin and surrounding counties. The BINGO games serve as a platform to educate participants about cancer, clinical trials, and the importance of diversity in research. By creating a relaxed and enjoyable atmosphere, the initiative aims to build trust and increase awareness among community members.

The project's long-term goals include fostering collaboration between minority communities and Penn State Health, improving clinical trial participation rates among underrepresented populations, and addressing healthcare disparities. Immediate objectives involve assessing the feasibility, educational utility, and engagement of the BINGO game through pre- and post-game surveys and knowledge tests.

Recruitment efforts target community centers and organizations like historically Black sororities and churches, leveraging their influence and trust within the community. The initiative strategically focuses on areas with high African American populations, such as Harrisburg, to maximize impact and engagement.

Feedback gathered from participants will guide future trial designs tailored to community needs, enhancing the inclusivity and relevance of research efforts. By promoting understanding and trust, Penn State Health aims to create a model that can be replicated to improve minority participation in clinical trials nationwide.
