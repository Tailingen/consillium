VHAG in Treating R/R T-ALL/LBL
Acute T cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL/LBL) is an aggressive type of leukemia that results from the malignant evolution of T-lineage progenitor cells at different differentiation stages. After induction chemotherapy and consolidation chemotherapy, there are still about 30% of patients who cannot achieve complete remission of clinical symptoms or negative MRD. This is also an important factor for the recurrence of ALL patients. In addition, most relapsed T-ALL/LBL patients relapse during first-line treatment. Once the disease relapses, it is difficult to cure for most young and adult patients, and the overall survival rate of patients is less than 10%.
Acute T Lymphpblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma
DRUG: Venetoclax|DRUG: homoharringtonine|DRUG: Cytarabine (Ara-C)|DRUG: G-CSF
Complete remission with or without incomplete PB cell recovery(CR/CRi) rate, Blast rate lower than 5% with or without peripheral blood cell recovery, at the end of Cycle 1 and 2（each cycle is 28days）
Overall survival (OS), Defined for all patients in a trial; measured from day 1 of treatment to the date of death from any cause;, up to 5 years|Event free survival(EFS), Defined for all patients in a trial; measured from day 1 of treatment to the date of treatment failure, hematologic relapse from CR/CRi or death from any cause, whichever occurs first;, up to 2 years|Minimal residual disease (MRD), MRD level detected by flow cytometry which value \<0.1% is defined as negtive, At the end of Cycle 1 and 2（each cycle is 28 days）|Adverse event, Safety of induction therapy, At the end of Cycle 1 and 2
This is a prospective, single-arm, phase II and open-label study. A total of 50 R/R T-ALL/LBL participants will be enrolled. The primary endpoint is complete remission with or without peripheral blood cell recovery. The induction therapy is a combination of Venetoclax(Ven), Homoharringtonine(HHT) , Cytarabine and G-CSF. The purpose of this study is to explore efficacy of the VHAG in the treatment of R/R T-ALL/LBL patients.
