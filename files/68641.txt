Treosulfan-based Conditioning for Allogeneic Stem-cell Transplantation (SCT) in Lymphoid Malignancies
The study hypotheses is that the introduction of dose escalated treosulfan, in substitution to busulfan or melphalan, will reduce toxicity after allogeneic transplantation while improving disease eradication in patients with lymphoid malignancies not eligible for standard transplantation.
