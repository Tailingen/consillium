CLDN6/GPC3/Mesothelin/AXL-CAR-NK Cell Therapy for Advanced Solid Tumors
This study is an open, exploratory clinical study to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of Claudin6, GPC3, Mesothelin, or AXL targeting CAR-NK cells in patients with Claudin6, GPC3, Mesothelin, or AXL-positive advanced solid tumors (ovarian cancer and others)
Stage IV Ovarian Cancer|Testis Cancer, Refractory|Endometrial Cancer Recurrent|CAR NK
BIOLOGICAL: Claudin6, GPC3, Mesothelin, or AXL targeting CAR-NK cells
Safety by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) V5.0, The type, frequency, severity, and duration of adverse events as a result of Claudin6, GPC3, Mesothelin, or AXL- CAR-NK cells infusion will be summarized., After CAR-NK cells infusion, up to 52 weeks.
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST 1.1) assessed by MRI or CT. ORR defined as the proportion of patients in whom a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) is observed as best overall response, prior to progression or further anti-cancer therapy., After CAR-NK cells infusion, up to 52 weeks.|Disease control rate (DCR), Disease control rate (DCR) defined as the proportion of patients in whom a CR or PR or stable disease (SD) (per RECIST 1.1, SD assessed at least 6 weeks after the first dose) is observed as best overall response., up to 52 weeks.|Duration of response (DOR), Duration of response (DOR) defined as the time from first objective response (CR or PR per RECIST 1.1) to first occurrence of objective tumor progression (Progressive disease (PD) per RECIST 1.1/recurrence) or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., up to 36 months
1. Choose appropriate advanced cancer patients with Claudin6, GPC3, Mesothelin, or AXL expression, with written consent for the study;
2. Perform PBMCs apheresis from the patient and isolate NK cells, transfect the NK cells with Claudin6, GPC3, Mesothelin, or AXL targeting CAR, amplify the number of transfected NK cells as needed, test the quality and killing activity of the Claudin6, GPC3, Mesothelin, or AXL-CAR-NK cells and then transplant back the patients via systemic or local infusions (via artery or intra-tumor), and follow up closely to collect related results as needed;
3. To enhance the killing capability, some CAR-NK cells are genetically engineered to express and secret IL7/CCL19 and/or SCFVs against PD1/CTLA4/Lag3; some CAR-NK cells are combined with Cannabidiol(CBD) or Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD);
4. Evaluate the clinical results as needed.
5. Will also perform the similar clinical trial on different cancer types with Claudin6, GPC3, Mesothelin, or AXL expression.
