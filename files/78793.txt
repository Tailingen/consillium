Assessing Perceptions of ML Explanations by Medical Oncologists
The objective of this proposal is to conduct a vignette-based survey among practicing oncology clinicians who treat non-small cell lung cancer to assess the trustworthiness of explainable predictions from a neurosymbolic AI vs. State-of-the-art post-hoc explanatory algorithms, using simulated patient data.
Oncology
OTHER: Once time de-identified Qualtrics survey
Determine whether neurosymbolic AI explainability methods improve the trustworthiness of explanations from a prognostic model, relative to post-hoc explainers., Oncologist will be invited to complete a vignette-based survey, 3 months
