Surgery Versus Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Stage I Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
The development of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for the treatment of stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has inspired a close partnership between thoracic surgery and radiation oncology. In this study, patients with stage I NSCLC will be screened prior to treatment and will be consented after their treatment plan has been determined. Prospectively collected patient-reported outcomes (PROs) will be collected for 3 years, as will outcomes data.

Disease-free survival (DFS), DFS is defined as time from the date of treatment to date of disease recurrence or death, whichever occurs earlier., Through 36 months post-treatment (estimated to be 36 months and 1 week)|Change in patient-reported outcomes as measured by the PROMIS Bank survey, * Surveys will occur at baseline, 1 month post-treatment, 6 months post-treatment, 12 months post-treatment, 24 months post-treatment, and 36 months post-treatment
* The PROMIS scores will be compared across the 8 pre-specified domains:

  * Cancer Bank v1.1 - Physical Function
  * Cancer Bank v1.1 - Pain Interference
  * Cancer Bank v1.0 - Fatigue
  * Cancer Bank v1.0 - Depression
  * Cancer Bank v1.0 - Anxiety
  * Bank v1.0 - Dyspnea Severity
  * Bank v2.0 - Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities
  * Bank v2.0 - Cognitive Function
* PROMIS is scored 1-100 and normalizes to the population mean of 50 with each 10 being a standard deviation. A higher score indicates a worse patient-reported outcome., From baseline through 36 months post-treatment (estimated to be 36 months and 1 week)
Cancer-specific survival (CSS), Cancer-specific survival (CSS) is defined as time from the date of treatment to date of cancer-related death. The alive patients without any signs or symptoms of that cancer are censored at the last follow-up., Through 36 months post-treatment (estimated to be 36 months and 1 week)|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as time from the date of treatment to date of death. The alive patients are censored at the last follow-up., Through 36 months post-treatment (estimated to be 36 months and 1 week)|Treated-related mortality, At 30 days (estimated to be 1 month and 1 week)|Number of post-treatment events (grade 3 and above), Post-treatment grade 3-5 events measured via CTCAE version 5.0, Through 36 months post-treatment (estimated to be 36 months and 1 week)
