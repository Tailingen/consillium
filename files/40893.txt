Zinc Sulfate for Human Papillomavirus (HPV)
The Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is well established as the primary causative agent in both warts and cervical cancer. Although cervical high risk HPV (hrHPV) infections have a high rate of spontaneous resolution this takes time and the infection can cause cervical cells to progress to precancerous and cancerous lesions. Zinc has been shown to play a central role in immunity. This study is to determine if oral zinc sulfate can improve clearance rates of high risk HPV versus placebo.

Clearance rates of high risk HPV, During 3 month treatment period
Progression versus Regression, Incidence of progression versus regression of cervical changes after treatment with oral zinc sulfate, During 3 month treatment period|Side Effects, Rates of side effects from zinc sulfate, After 3 month treatment period|Compliance Rates, Examine rates of patients finishing the 3-month course of zinc sulfate, After 3 month treatment period|Parity, Examine the correlation of parity on HPV clearance, After 3 month treatment period|Low Zinc Levels and Persistence, Examine potential correlation between low serum levels of zinc and persistence of HPV., After 3 month treatment period|Zinc Levels and Regression, Examine the relation between zinc levels before and after treatment and the relation to regression of HPV., After 3 month treatment period
Upon enrollment eligible participants will be randomized and given a three-month supply of zinc sulfate or placebo to be taken as directed. They will have zinc serum lab testing at enrollment and upon study completion. Patients will also be asked to complete short questionnaires and to make study staff aware of any side effects they should experience.
