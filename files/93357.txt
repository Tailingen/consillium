Pixantrone Dimaleate in Treating Patients With HER2-Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as pixantrone dimaleate, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving pixantrone dimaleate in different ways may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well pixantrone dimaleate works in treating patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: pixantrone dimaleate
Proportion of Confirmed Tumor Responses (Complete or Partial Response), The proportion of confirmed responses will be estimated by the number of women who achieve a CR or PR on two consecutive evaluations at least 6-8 weeks apart depending on the dose level. The proportion of successes will be estimated by the number of successes divided by the total number of evaluable patients at each dose level. Confidence intervals for the true success proportion at each dose level will be calculated according to the approach of Duffy and Santner. Response will be evaluated in this study using the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines (version 1.1); Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions, each target lymph node must have reduction in short axis to \<1.0 cm. and normalization of tumor biomarkers. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of the non-nodal target lesions and the short axis of the target lymph nodes taking as reference the Baseline Sum of Diameters., Up to 5 years
Time to Disease Progression, Time to disease progression is defined as the time from registration to the earliest date of documentation of disease progression. If a patient dies without a documentation of disease progression the patient will be considered to have had disease progression at the time of their death. If the patient is declared to be a major treatment violation, the patient will be censored on the date the treatment violation was declared to have occurred. In the case of a patient starting treatment and then never returning for any evaluations, the patient will be censored for progression one day post-registration. The distribution of time to progression will be estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier at each dose level. Progression is defined using the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines (version 1.1)., Up to 5 years|6-month Progression-free Survival Rate, The 6-month progression free survival (6-mo PFS) rate is the proportion of efficacy-evaluable patients progression-free 6 months from registration. The 6-mo PFS rate is defined as the total number of efficacy-evaluable patients on study without documentation of disease progression 6 months from registration divided by the total number of efficacy-evaluable patients enrolled on study. Patients who died without documentation of progression will be considered to have progressed on the date of their death. The true 6-mo PFS rate will be estimated by the proportion of efficacy-evaluable patients on study without documentation of disease progression 6 months from registration at each dose level. Binomial confidence intervals for 6-mo PFS rate will be constructed for each dose level. Progression is defined using the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines (version 1.1)., At 6 months|Overall Survival Time, Survival time is defined as the time from registration to death due to any cause. The distribution of survival time will be estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier at each dose level., Up to 5 years|Duration of Response, Duration of response is defined for all evaluable patients with measurable disease who have achieved a confirmed response as the date at which the patient's earliest best objective status is first noted to be either a CR or PR to the earliest date progression is documented at each dose level. If a patient dies subsequent to the confirmed response without a documentation of disease progression, the patient will be considered to have had disease progression at the time of their death. In the case of a patient failing to return for evaluations before a documentation of disease progression, the patient will be censored for progression on the date of last evaluation. The distribution of duration of response will be estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier at each dose level., Up to 5 years|Toxicity, For this secondary endpoint, toxicity is defined as a grade 3 or higher adverse events that is classified as either possibly, probably, or definitely related to study treatment. The assignment of attribution to study treatment and grade (or degree of severity) of the adverse event are classified using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. The number of participants reporting a grade 3 or higher toxicity is reported. For a list of all reported adverse events, please refer to the Adverse Events Section below., Up to 1 year after treatment
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To assess the proportion of confirmed tumor responses at each dose level of pixantrone

Secondary

* To describe the distribution of progression-free survival (PFS) times of patients receiving pixantrone
* To assess the 6-month PFS rate in patients receiving each dose level of pixantrone
* To describe the overall survival distribution of patients receiving pixantrone
* To assess the adverse event profile of pixantrone in the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer.
* To evaluate the quality of life and patient-reported symptoms of patients receiving the study regimen

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized according to prior doxorubicin treatment ( yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

* Arm I: Patients receive pixantrone dimaleate IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
* Arm II: Patients receive pixantrone dimaleate IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Some patients undergo blood sample collection at baseline and periodically during study for circulating tumor cells analysis by CellSearch System and mRNA isolation assays.

Patients complete quality-of-life questionnaires using the Linear Analogue Self Assessment (LASA6) and the Patient-Reported Outcomes Version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) at baseline and periodically during study.

After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for up to 5 years.
