Targeted Drug Combined With CHOP in the Treatment of Newly Diagnosed Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma
This prospective，multi-center，open-label, controlled study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of targeted drug in combination with CHOP in treatment of newly diagnosed peripheral T-cell lymphoma.
Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma
DRUG: CHOP|DRUG: CHOP+X
Complete response rate, Percentage of participants with complete response was determined on the basis of investigator assessments according to 2014 Lugano criteria, At the end of Cycle 6 (each cycle is 21 days)
Overall response rate, Percentage of participants with overall response was determined on the basis of investigator assessments according to 2014 Lugano criteria, At the end of Cycle 6 (each cycle is 21 days)|Progression free survival, Progression-free survival was defined as the time from the date of diagnosis until the date of the first documented day of disease progression or relapse, using 2014 Lugano criteria,or death from any cause, whichever occurred first., Baseline up to data cut-off (up to approximately 4 years)|Overall survival, Overall survival was defined as the time from the date of diagnosis to the date of death from any cause. Reported is the percentage of participants with event. of disease progression or relapse, using 2014 Lugano criteria,or death from any cause, whichever occurred first., Baseline up to data cut-off (up to approximately 4 years)|Duration of response, Time from first occurrence of documented CR or PR to disease progression/relapse, or death from any cause for participants with a response of CR or PR. Tumor assessments were performed with PET-CT., Baseline up to data cut-off (up to approximately 4 years)|Treatment related mortality, Percentage of death related with treatment on the basis of investigator assessments, Baseline up to data cut-off (up to approximately 4 years)|Number of Participants With Treatment-Related Adverse Events as Assessed by CTCAE, An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events., Baseline up to data cut-off (up to approximately 4 years)|Change From Baseline in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) Domain Scores, The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a health-related quality of life questionnaire. A higher score indicates better quality of life, with changes of 5 to 10 points considered to be a minimally important difference to participants., Baseline (pre-dose [Hour 0] on Cycle1 Day1), Cycle3 Day 1, end of treatment (up to Month 6), every 3 months 1st year, every 6 months 2nd year, and 12 months thereafter up to data cut-off, up to approximately 4 years (cycle length = 21 days)
Circulating free Deoxyribonucleic Acid (cfDNA) monitoring, CfDNA in peripheral blood assessed by local lab, Baseline up to data cut-off (up to approximately 4 years)|Exploratory biomarker analysis, Exploratory biomarker to predict treatment response and survival, Baseline up to data cut-off (up to approximately 4 years)
Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL）is a distinct and heterogeneous histopathologic subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), accounting for \~10%. Patients with PTCL still have poor treatment response and prognosis under conventional CHOP regimen. There is no standard of care for those patients. Targeted drugs are warranted in this group of patients to improve survival. This prospective，multi-center，open-label, controlled study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of targeted drug in combination with CHOP in treatment of newly diagnosed peripheral T-cell lymphoma.
