Everolimus and OSI-906 for Patients With Refractory Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of OSI-906 and everolimus for the treatment of patients with refractory metastatic colorectal cancer.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: OSI-906|DRUG: Everolimus
To Determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of the Combination of OSI-906 and Everolimus for the Treatment of Patients With Refractory Metastatic Colorectal Cancer., The MTD of the drug combination will be determined as the highest dose at which â‰¤1 of 6 subjects experiences a Grade 3 or Grade 4 DLT according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v4.0, 18 Months
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time between Day 1 Cycle 1 and date of first documented recurrence or death. Patients who do not exhibit progression while on trial will be censored at their last known assessment. Progression is defined per RECIST criteria as either 1) at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest (nadir) sum since the treatment started, or the appearance of one or more new lesions. Requires not only 20% increase, but absolute increase of a minimum of 5 mm over sum. OR 2) Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions., 18 Months|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time between Day 1 Cycle 1 to the date of death from any cause. Those remaining alive will be censored at their last known assessment or follow-up., 18 months|Response Rate, Response rate (RR) will be estimated as the proportion of patients exhibiting complete response or partial response out of all evaluable cases. Complete Response is defined per RECIST as disappearance of all target/non-target lesions and normalization of tumor markers. Partial Response is defined per RECIST as At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD., 18 months
