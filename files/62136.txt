ADCE-T02, a Tissue Factor Targeted Antibody-Drug Conjugate, in Patients With Selected Advanced Solid Tumours
Adcendo ApS is conducting a phase 1 study of an investigational drug called ADCE-T02 (previously known as AMT-754), a tissue factor targeted antibody-drug conjugate which may be used in the future as a possible treatment for advanced solid tumors.

The main purpose of the study is to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), the recommended dose and the safety and tolerability of ADCE-T02 when given as a single therapy over a range of different dose levels.
