Stellate Ganglion Block and Cerebral Vasospasm
At present, cerebral vasospasm (cVS) is the main cause of delayed cerebral infarction (DCI), which leads to high disability and mortality rate after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. As a consequence, the key of reducing DCI is to prevent cVS. But unfortunately, despite years of efforts, the prevention and treatment of cVS is still a major clinical dilemma and various ways of treatment are still being explored. Recent studies have shown that stellate ganglion block (SGB) can dilate cerebral vessels and alleviate the impact of existing cVS. However, there is no study to evaluate the effect of early application of SGB on the improvement and prevention of cVS after aSAH.

The incidence of symptomatic vasospasm during hospitalization, Symptomatic vasospasm is defined as new focal or global neurological dysfunction or a decrease in the Glasgow coma score by more than 2 points, and with angiographic vasospasm on TCD or CTA., an average of 2 weeks
The incidence of TCD vasospasm during hospitalization, The mean blood flow velocity (MFV) of the middle cerebral artery ≥ 120 cm/s or Lindegaard index (ratio of MFV of the middle cerebral artery to the internal carotid artery) ≥ 3., on the days 3-5 after operation|The incidence of CTA vasospasm on the days 3-5 after operation, Compared with the preoperative baseline, the corresponding vessel diameter narrowed by more than 30% or new segmental stenosis occurred, not related to atherosclerosis or mechanical artery stenosis caused by arterial clamps or coils., on the days 3-5 after operation|The incidence of hypoperfusion in CTP diagnosis on the days 3-5 after operation, The incidence of hypoperfusion in CTP diagnosis, on the days 3-5 after operation|The incidence of new cerebral infarction observed on the days 90 after operation and discharge ., New cerebral infarction is defined only as the appearance of new low-density infarct shadow on CT image compared with preoperation., on the days 90 after operation and discharge|The changes of he mean blood flow velocity (mBFV) after operation, the changes in the mean blood flow velocity (mBFV) of all large intracranial anterior circulation vessels, on the days 3-5 after operation|Total length of stay in the intensive care unit and hospital., Days, on the 90 days|The modified Rankin scale at discharge, 30days, and 90 days, The modified Rankin scale ≤2 is defined as good prognosis, on the 30 and 90 days|All-cause mortality rate up to 90 days., The rate, on the 90 days|Postoperative delirium incidence during hospitalization, The rate, on the days 1-3 after operation|Postoperative cognitive dysfunction, The rate, At discharge，an average of 2 weeks|The proportion of remedial treatment after CVS, The rate, At discharge，an average of 2 weeks|Adverse events during hospitalization, Myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, pulmonary embolism, infection, SGB related complications, etc, At discharge，an average of 2 weeks
Cerebral vasospasm refers to the extensive segmental or diffuse contraction of cerebral vasculature after aSAH, and cerebral blood flow is significantly reduced, which can lead to delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) or delayed ischemic neurological dysfunction (DIND). Past studies have shown that if cerebral vasospasm occurs in patients with aSAH, the proportion of ischemic brain injury can be as high as 20%-30%.Obviously, prevention and treatment of CVS are the key to reducing the disability and mortality of aSAH.
