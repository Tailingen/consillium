Lattice Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (Lattice SBRT) for Localized Unresectable or Metastatic Conventional Type Chondrosarcoma
Unresectable (including metastatic) conventional chondrosarcoma requires high dose radiation for local control. Radiation Oncologists have traditionally used long radiation courses and concern for toxicity to surrounding organs at risk. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has the ability to deliver high doses of radiation in a manner that may improve clinical response but has size limitations. SBRT delivered with lattice radiotherapy (LRT) may safely dose escalate smaller portions of the tumor and also provide improved cancer control. This study is to evaluate the safety and initial efficacy of this treatment approach.
