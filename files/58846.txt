Ibrutinib Monotherapy Versus Fixed-duration Venetoclax Plus Obinutuzumab Versus Fixed-duration Ibrutinib Plus Venetoclax in Patients with Previously Untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL)
The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of continuous ibrutinib monotherapy with fixed-duration venetoclax plus obinutuzumab and fixed-duration ibrutinib plus venetoclax by measuring progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with previously untreated CLL.
Chronic Lymphoid Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: Ibrutinib|BIOLOGICAL: Venetoclax|BIOLOGICAL: Obinutuzumab
Investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS), Time from randomization to the first occurrence of progression or relapse (determined using standard iwCLL guidelines), or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, Up to 80 month
Rates of undetectable minimal residual disease (uMRD) in peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM), Undetectable MRD (uMRD) is defined as \<10-4 (=1 CLL-cell per 10,000 leukocytes analyzed).The uMRD rate is defined as the proportion of patients having achieved uMRD., At final restaging (RE): 18 months after start of treatment and additional BM assessment approx. 12 months after RE|MRD levels in PB at different time points, MRD is defined as the number of CLL-cells that can be detected in peripheral blood (PB) or bone marrow (BM). MRD values will be categorized into negative (\<10-4) and positive (â‰¥10-4), Up to 80 month|Overall response rate (ORR), Proportion of patients having achieved a complete response (CR), a CR with incomplete recovery of the bone marrow (CRi), or a partial response (PR) as best response., At final restaging (RE): 18 months after start of treatment|CR/CRi rate, Proportion of patients having achieved a CR or CRi as best response (= number of patients with best response CR or CRi divided by the number of the intention-to-treat population (ITT) population), At final restaging (RE): 18 months after start of treatment|Event-free survival, Event-free survival (EFS) (I vs VG and I vs VI), Up to 80 month|Time to next treatment, Time to next treatment (TTNT), Up to 80 month|PFS2, Progression free survival 2 (i.e. PFS after second-line treatment), Up to 80 month|Incidence of safety parameters such as adverse events (AE) and adverse events of particular/special interest (AEPI/AESI), Type, frequency, severity and relationship to study treatment.of AEs and AEPIs/AESIs, Up to 80 month|Safety parameter TLS, Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) risk category after G or I lead-in (before venetoclax ramp up), Up to 80 month
