A Study to Evaluate 9MW2821 Versus Chemotherapy in Subjects With Previously Treated Locally Advanced or Metastatic Urothelial Cancer
The purpose of this study was to compare the antitumor activity of 9MW2821 and chemotherapy in participants with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer previously treated with PD-(L)1 inhibitor and platinum-containing chemotherapy.
