Trial of Laryngeal Preservation Comparing Induced CT Followed by RT vs CT Concomitant to RT
This study compare the survival without laryngeal dysfunction 2 years after the end of treatment, obtained by chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy or chemotherapy with cisplatin administrated during radiotherapy.
Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Fluorouracil|RADIATION: radiotherapy
free survival, Minimum time between randomization and the occurrence of events such as: death, total laryngectomy, tracheotomy., 24 months after treatment initiation
Overall survival, "From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months")., 60 months|Progression free survival, "From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression assessed up to 60 months")., 60 months|Larynx Preservation, From date of randomization up to 24 months evaluated by dynamic deglutition videoscopy, 24 months after treatment initiation|Feasibility of salvage surgery, Assessing the number of recurrences that could be successfully treated with salvage surgery and description of postoperative, 60 months after randomization
In patients with tumors classified as T3 or T4 larynx and hypopharynx, the usually recommended treatment was total laryngectomy.This intervention allows to obtain locoregional disease control in 75% of cases, without laryngectomy

TPF arm followed by radiotherapy was validated in a Phase III (GORTEC 2000-01), it will be the standard treatment.

The RTOG study concluded that chemotherapy administrated during radiotherapy became a standard of laryngeal preservation.

Taking together all these considerations, it is necessary to perform a direct comparison in a randomized trial to further test this hypothesis. Chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy will be the standard arm. It hopes to increase the survival rate from 52% to 65% in the experimental arm.
