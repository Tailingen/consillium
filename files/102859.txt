H101 Combined With TACE for Primary Hepatocellular Carcinoma With Portal Vein Thrombosis
This study is the first to compare the efficacy and safety of recombinant human adenovirus type 5 injection via hepatic artery infusion combined with TACE-based combination therapy for the treatment of patients with stage IIIa primary hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein carcinoma thrombosis, providing a safe and reliable treatment method for the clinical treatment of this group of patients, and also providing a reference and basis for the treatment of other tumors with this new treatment model.
Primary Hepatocellular Carcinoma|Portal Vein Thrombosis
DRUG: Recombinant human adenovirus type 5 + TACE
disease control rate (DCR), The percentage of patients whose tumors shrank or stabilized and remained for a certain period of time, including cases in complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR), and stable (SD), Up to 1 year
progress free survival(PFS), The time between the start of randomization and the onset of (any aspect of) tumor progression or death (from any cause), Up to 1 year|overall survival(OS), The time from randomization to death (from any cause), Up to 1 year
This is a prospective, single-arm study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of recombinant human adenovirus type 5 injection combined with TACE-based combination therapy in patients with stage IIIa primary hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein carcinoma thrombosis. Subjects will be examined and evaluated at the study center, and after meeting the inclusion criteria, patients will be enrolled in a combination of recombinant human adenovirus type 5 injection via hepatic artery infusion and TACE regimen. The study is divided into screening period, baseline period, treatment period, and follow-up period. Follow-up after the end of treatment will be every 3 months until death or the end of this study. The primary study endpoint of this study is disease control rate (DCR) (up to 1 year), while progression free survival (PFS) (up to 1 year), 1-year overall survival rate, and distant metastasis rate are observed, and adverse events occurring during the study period are monitored for safety Data analysis.
