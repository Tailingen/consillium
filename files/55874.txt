18F-F-AraG PET Imaging to Evaluate Immunological Response to CAR T Cell Therapy in Lymphoma
This is a pilot study in adult subjects with aggressive B-cell lymphoma who will receive commercial or research CAR T cell therapy as anticancer treatment.
Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
DRUG: [ 18F]F-AraG PET
Primary outcome measure, Spearman correlation between changes in SUV in \[18F\]F-AraG signal on PET imaging to changes in T-cell infiltrates in biopsy samples, values obtained on Day 0 and Day 4 (± 2 days)
First exploratory outcome measure, correlation between changes in SUV \[18F\]F-AraG signal on PET imaging to the observed clinical benefit rate using RECISTv1.1 criteria., ≥ 3 months|Second exploratory outcome measure, Correlation between changes in \[18F\]F-AraG signal to the frequency and grade of two common CAR T cell toxicities, cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity, if observed in this study population., ≥ 3 months
Primary Objectives:

\* Explore the relationship of change in \[18F\]F-AraG PET signal following CAR T cell treatment with changes in T cell infiltration in tumor biopsies.

Exploratory Analyses:

* Explore the relationship of change in \[18F\]F-AraG PET signal in tumor lesions following CAR T cell treatment with clinical benefit rate (defined as Complete Response (CR) + Partial Response (PR) + stable disease (SD) ≥ 3 months) using RECISTv1.1 criteria
* Correlate the change in \[18F\]F-AraG PET signal in tumor lesions following CAR T cell therapy with maximum grade of Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity experienced.
