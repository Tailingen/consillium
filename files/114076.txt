Gefitinib in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Synovial Sarcoma
RATIONALE: Biological therapies such as gefitinib may interfere with the growth of the tumor cells and slow the growth of synovial sarcoma.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of gefitinib in treating patients who have locally advanced or metastatic synovial sarcoma.
Sarcoma
DRUG: gefitinib
Progression-free rate at 12 weeks
Toxicity as assessed by CTC 2.0|Response as assessed by RECIST criteria|Time to onset of response|Duration of response|Overall survival
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the therapeutic activity of gefitinib, in terms of progression-free rate, in patients with locally advanced or metastatic synovial sarcoma expressing HER1.
* Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.
* Determine the objective response, in terms of time to onset and duration of response, in patients treated with this drug.
* Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized, multicenter study.

Patients receive oral gefitinib twice daily. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients are followed every 3 months.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-44 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.
