Erector Spinae Catheter Versus Paravertebral Catheter for Postoperative Analgesia in Cancer Patients Post Mastectomies
All patients admitted in National Cancer institute, Cairo University for breast surgeries will be investigated for inclusion criteria in the current study. And will be enrolled if fulfilled the criteria into 2 groups

.70 patients will be included in this prospective randomized study. The patients will be allocated into two groups: the ESPB group (group E, n = 35) , and the paravertebral group (group P, n =35)

* All patients will do Ultrasound-guided ESPB for group E and PVB for group P before receiving general anesthesia
* Postoperatively Patients in both groups will receive intravenous morphine 3 mg as rescue analgesic
Post Operative Pain
PROCEDURE: ERECTOR SPINAE PLANE BLOCK and PARAVERTEBRAL BLOCK:|PROCEDURE: PARAVERTEBRAL BLOCK:
Total 48 hours Post-operative opioid consumption to keep VAS score â‰¤4., the VAS score rating, in which 0 = "no pain" and 10 = "worst possible pain". both during rest and movement, 48 hours postoperative
1st request of analgesia, 1st request of analgesia , any hemodynamic instability and complications, 48 hours postoperative
* 70patients will be included in this prospective randomized study. The patients will be allocated into two groups: the ESPB group (group E, n = 35) , and the paravertebral group (group P, n =35)
* All patients will do Ultrasound-guided ESPB for group E and PVB for group P before receiving GA
* Postoperatively Patients in both groups will receive intravenous morphine 3 mg as rescue analgesic.
* Random numbers were generated using a computer-generated randomization code and were sealed in an opaque envelope. Randomization was conducted by a person who was not involved in the study.
* An independent observer who was blind to the group assignment checked the intraoperative and postoperative data.
* VAS pain score immediately postoperative and at 2,4,6, 8,12,18,24,36 ,48hrs.postoperative.
