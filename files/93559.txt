Prospective Evaluation of the Tool-in-lesion Technology of the Galaxy System in Routine Clinical Practice
A prospective observational study evaluating the accuracy of the tool-in-lesion technology of the Galaxy SystemTM in normal clinical practice.
Lung Cancer|Lung; Nodule
DEVICE: Robotic assisted bronchoscopy
Successful Navigation to the lesion, Placing the scope in an adequate location which the physician operator judges as suitable to initiate biopsy., During the procedure|Successful tool-in-lesion, Successful tool-in-lesion (defined as the tool within the lesion) as confirmed by CBCT., During the procedure|Serious Adverse Events, Serious device or procedure related adverse events, During the procedure and up to 7 days post procedure
Diagnostic yield, Number of patients who are provided a definitive diagnosis based on the pathology report of the biopsied tissue., End of procedure and up to 2-years post-procedure|Center Strike, Center strike (defined as inner one-third of lesion from all 3 views (axial, sagittal, and coronal) confirmed by CBCT., During the procedure
The goal of this study is to collect clinical data from eligible subjects in routine clinical practice to confirm the safety and effectiveness of the Galaxy SystemTM with integrated tool-in-lesion tomography (TiLT+) in bronchoscopically biopsying small peripheral pulmonary nodules.
