Neoadjuvant Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy Prior to Radical Prostatectomy for High Risk Prostate Cancer
This is a single-arm prospective non-randomized, non-blinded trial to assess the safety of neoadjuvant stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) before surgery in high risk prostate cancer patients.

Radiation therapy will be delivered over 5 treatment sessions for approximately 1.5 weeks total.
Prostate Cancer
RADIATION: Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy|PROCEDURE: Radical Prostatectomy
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Neoadjuvant SBRT, The MTD is defined as the SBRT dose that with radical prostatectomy induces dose-limiting toxicity in 28% of subjects or less., 6-week post-prostatectomy
