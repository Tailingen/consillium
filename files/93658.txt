A Phase 1 Study of AZD9833 in Japanese Women With ER Positive, HER2 Negative Advanced Breast Cancer
This is a Phase 1, open-label study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and anti-tumor activity of AZD9833 in Japanese women with endocrineresistant ER+ HER2- breast cancer that is not amenable to treatment with curative intent. This study consists of 2 cohorts, Cohort1 and Cohort2. In cohort 1 (for tolerability evaluation), a minimum of 3, or up to 6, evaluable Japanese patients with ER+ HER2- breast cancer will be enrolled. In cohort 2 (for exploratory research), at least 6 to maximum 12 evaluable Japanese patients with ER+ HER2- breast cancer will be enrolled.

Objectives:

Primary objective:

To investigate the safety and tolerability of AZD9833 in Japanese women with ER+ HER2- advanced breast cancer

Secondary objective:

To assess the anti-tumor activity and efficacy of AZD9833

Exploratory objectives:

To investigate AZD9833 activity in tumor cells

Overall design:

This is a Phase 1, open-label study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and anti-tumor activity of AZD9833 in Japanese women with endocrineresistant ER+ HER2- breast cancer that is not amenable to treatment with curative intent. Eligible patients will receive AZD9833. In cohort 1 (for tolerability evaluation), a minimum of 3 to maximum 6 evaluable patients will be enrolled.

For cohort 2, if paired biopsy after administration of the study drug becomes inoperable during administration of the study drug, additional subjects can be added to obtain an evaluable biopsy sample.

In cohort 2 (for exploratory research), eligible patients will receive AZD9833 once daily and at least 6 to maximum 12 patients will be enrolled. In cohort 2, paired biopsy sample will be collected from at least 6 and maximum 12 patients. If paired biopsy after administration of the study drug becomes inoperable during administration of the study drug, additional subjects can be added to obtain an evaluable biopsy sample.

Number of Subjects:

Maximum 18 evaluable subjects will be enrolled in this study.
