Gynaecological Follow-up of a Subset of 580299/008 (NCT00122681) Study Subjects
This study is designed to provide up to four years of annual oncogenic HPV DNA testing and cervical cytology examination for NCT00122681 study subjects who displayed normal cervical cytology but tested positive for oncogenic HPV infection at their last NCT00122681 study visit (Visit 10, Month 48).

This follow-up study will also be offered to subjects who were pregnant at their last NCT00122681 study visit (Visit 10, Month 48) so that no cervical sample could be collected at that visit.

The objectives \& outcome measures of the primary phase (study 008/580299) are presented in a separate protocol posting (NCT00122681).

OTHER: Gynaecological follow-up
Number of Subjects With HPV DNA in Cervical Samples by Hybrid Capture 2 Test (HCII), Subjects who presented oncogenic HPV DNA in cervical samples by HPV DNA testing. The presence of oncogenic HPV infection was determined by the Hybrid Capture 2 (HCII) test, which detects HPV DNA types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59 and 68.

CIN = Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. CIN1/CIN2/CIN3 = Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1/grade 2/grade 3.

Note: Only CIN1/Only CIN2/Only CIN3 categories contain the subject who has only CIN1/CIN2/CIN3, but not the combinations., At Month 48|Number of Subjects With Treatment Referrals by Treatment Type at Month 12, If a high-grade lesion was detected, the subject was to be referred to treatment according to local medical practice. Any further management following local cervical therapy for cervical lesions was to be handled according to local medical practice within the local health care system. The subject's participation in the study concluded after treatment.

The treatment types included the following: Loop excision of cervix, Loop cone of cervix, Cold knife cone of cervix, Laser excision, other., At Month 12|Number of Subjects With Treatment Referrals by Treatment Type at Month 24, If a high-grade lesion was detected, the subject was to be referred to treatment according to local medical practice. Any further management following local cervical therapy for cervical lesions was to be handled according to local medical practice within the local health care system.

Any was defined as the occurrence of any unsolicited AE regardless of intensity grade or relation to vaccination. Grade 3 AE = an AE which prevented normal, everyday activities. Related = AE assessed by the investigator as related to the vaccination., From Month 12 [i.e. 12 months after the last visit in HPV-008 (NCT00122681) primary study) up to Month 48 [i.e. 48 months after the last visit in HPV-008 (NCT00122681) primary study]|Number of Subjects With Any Fatal SAEs, With Any SAEs Assessed as Possibly Related to Study Participation or to a Concurrent GSK Medication., SAEs assessed include medical occurrences that resulted in death, were life-threatening, required hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization or resulted in disability/incapacity., From Month 12 [i.e. 12 months after the last visit in HPV-008 (NCT00122681) primary study) up to Month 48 [i.e. 48 months after the last visit in HPV-008 (NCT00122681) primary study]
