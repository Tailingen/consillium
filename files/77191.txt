Phase II Image Guided Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This study will help researchers learn about the best dose of radiation to be used when treating large early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a treatment called stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR). Current treatments with SABR for early stage NSCLC show positive response. But, for large early stage NSCLC it may be better to give different SABR doses than what is used in routine early stage NSCLC treatment. It is not understood which dose is best for treating large early stage NSCLC. Therefore, this study can help researchers learn if giving a higher dose using SABR over a period of 5-10 treatment days can increase the chance of cure for large early stage NSCLC.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
RADIATION: Image Guided Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy
Local Control Rate (Absence of Local Progression) Using SABR for Treatment of NSCLC, 2 years
Best Response, To determine the 2-year regional, and distant metastasis rates, progression-free survival (PFS), local progression free survival (L-PFS), overall survival (OS), 2 years
Treatment Plan:

7.5 Gy x 10 daily fractions delivered with volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) or regular intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT).

* Optional schedule of 12 Gy x 5 daily fractions can may also be used ONLY in situations where dose constraints for organs at risk can be EASILY met while optimal planning target volume (PTV) coverage is achieved; but the 7.5 Gy x 10 daily fractions schedule is preferred.
* All doses are prescribed to the tumor periphery.

For this protocol, patients will be followed only up to 2 years post radiation therapy.
