Compare Apatinib Plus Chemotherapy Drug Versus Chemotherapy Drug as Second-line Treatment in NSCLC
Apatinib, a novel targeted inhibitor of VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2), shows significant antitumor activity in the patients with GC. The purpose of this study is to determine whether apatinib plus chemotherapy drug can improve progression free survival compared with chemotherapy drug in patients with metastatic the non-small cell lung cancer who failed one lines of chemotherapy.
Nonsmall Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Apatinib/docetaxel/pemetrexed|DRUG: docetaxel/pemetrexed
progression-free survival, To compare progression-free survival (PFS) in subjects treated with apatinib plus chemotherapy drug versus chemotherapy drug as a second-line treatment in whom with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 6 months
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in world wild, especially non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Detection and early intervention are difficult because pathogenesis of NSCLC is not yet entirely clear.Most of them are advanced or metastatic patients, so approach 3/4 NSCLC undergo chemotherapy. Fewer treatment options exist on NSCLC whom is wild type of EGFR. The patient did not benefit from the existing treatment regimen after first-line treatment. There is currently no effective drug to treat this group of patients.
