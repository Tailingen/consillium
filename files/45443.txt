Safety and Tolerability of Low-Dose Temozolomide During Whole Brain Radiation in Patients With Cerebral Metastases From Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (Study P04071)(TERMINATED)
This is a phase II, randomized, multicenter, open-label study designed to assess the safety and tolerability of concomitant chemotherapy with low-dose temozolomide during whole brain radiation and later on at 14 days on/14 days off schedule in patients with cerebral metastases from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The response to temozolomide will be evaluated by clinical follow up and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) performed every 2 months. Progression-free survival at 6 months, duration of overall survival, and quality of life will also be evaluated.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
DRUG: Temozolomide and radiotherapy|PROCEDURE: Whole brain radiotherapy
Number of Participants With Progression-free Survival (6 Month), The occurrence of progression will be compared between the study groups by Kaplan-Meier curves. Responsiveness to temozolomide will be evaluated by brain Magnetic Resonance Imanging (MRI)/Computed Tomography (CT), thorax CT, and Quality of Life (QoL) assessments. Progression-free is defined as \<25% increase in tumor size on CT or MRI., 6 months
