Fecal Immunochemical Test for Advanced Adenoma Detection in Colorectal Cancer Screening
Early detecting and removing of colorectal advanced adenomas can reduce incidence of colorectal cancer. In order to reduce the incidence of colorectal cancer, improve the early diagnosis of colorectal cancer, the investigators conducted this study to explore diagnostic accuracy of fecal immunochemical test in colorectal cancer screening population.

Colorectal cancer accounts for approximately 10% of all annually diagnosed cancers and cancer-related deaths worldwide. With progress of developing countries, it is predicted that the incidence of colorectal cancer worldwide will increase to 2.5 million new cases in 2035. The majority of colorectal cancer is thought to arise from precancerous lesions through the adenoma-carcinoma pathway. Detecting and removing of colorectal advanced adenomas can reduce incidence of colorectal cancer. In order to reduce the incidence of colorectal cancer, improve the early diagnosis of colorectal cancer, the investigators conducted this study to explore diagnostic accuracy of fecal immunochemical test in colorectal cancer screening population.
