Staying Healthy With Follow-up Care: A Mobile Chatbot Feasibility Study for AYA Cancer Survivors
The purpose of this project is to identify effective strategies to assist survivors of childhood and young adult cancers (diagnosed between birth and age 39) who have not returned for follow-up cancer care for 3 or more years, to reengage with the health care system. The investigator will evaluate the effect of a novel, bidirectional conversational agent ("Penny"), compared to usual care, to assist patients with scheduling appointments, lab work as well as scans and specialty appointments as needed.
Survivorship
BEHAVIORAL: Penny
To evaluate the utilization of a chatbot (Penny) to increase receipt of evidence-based survivorship care in YA survivors of pediatric and YA cancers, We will identify adult survivors of pediatric and YA cancers who have not been seen for follow-up care \>3 years and evaluate patients' engagement with Penny to schedule return appointments and adhere to recommended life-long ongoing follow-up care according to the NCCN guidelines. Patients will be monitored over a 16-week period to see if they scheduled a follow-up care appointment., 1 year|Number of patients who agree to use Penny and patient engagement overtime in those patients randomized to the Penny arm, Percentage of initial responses to the conversation initiated by Penny (opt in vs. opt out) providing permission for text messaging, 1 year|Number of patients who agree to use Penny and patient engagement overtime in those patients randomized to the Penny arm, Total number of times patients engage with Penny to schedule follow up appointments, scans, labs, recommendations for other services made at each clinical visit, 1 year|Number of patients who agree to use Penny and patient engagement overtime in those patients randomized to the Penny arm, Total number of patients who engage with Penny throughout the study, schedule and are compliant with appointments, scans, labs, and referrals to other services made at each clinical visit, 1 year
To achieve this, the investigator will use a two-arm randomized controlled trial to explore how multilevel factors impact the acceptability and effectiveness of this strategy by collecting qualitative and quantitative data from patients. Penny is a conversational agent ("chatbot") that engages patients in real time via text messaging, allowing for bidirectional communication and motivational cues to promote adherence. The chatbot will assist patients who have not been see for cancer follow-up care, with scheduling follow-up appointments, labs, scans, specialty appointments, and monitor compliance with the appointments made.
