Pro- and Anti-inflammatory Cytokines in PCOS
The study will involve measurements and comparisons of the concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines: IL-6, TNF-α, IL-18, as well as anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4 in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and insulin resistance, women with polycystic ovary syndrome without carbohydrate metabolism disorders, and women without PCOS (control group).

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy among women of reproductive age, which, in addition to menstrual disorders and infertility due to anovulation, is characterized by insulin resistance (IR). The metabolic disturbances associated with PCOS contribute to a higher incidence of cardiovascular diseases and endometrial cancer prior to menopause. The severity of IR in women with PCOS is linked to abdominal obesity. There is an urgent need to identify more precise and universal markers of insulin resistance than the HOMA-IR index or glucose tolerance tests, which are intended to identify existing disorders rather than predispositions. Additionally, there is a need to investigate the balance of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory parameters in PCOS and their relationship with insulin resistance, which is responsible for the development of adverse health complications.

The objective of this study is to measure and compare the concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines: IL-6, TNF-α, IL-18, and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4 in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and insulin resistance, women with polycystic ovary syndrome without carbohydrate metabolism disorders, and women without PCOS (control group).

Tests will be conducted using immunoenzymatic methods (ELISA) and the Erba XL biochemical analyzer. The concentrations of the substances under investigation will be measured and compared among the three study groups. Statistical analysis will be performed using SPSS Statistics software.
