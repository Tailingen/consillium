Lifestyle and Dietary Pattern in Relation to Precursor Lesions of Colorectal Cancer and Cardiometabolic Diseases
The association between lifestyle and dietary patterns with precursor lesions of colorectal cancer and cardiometabolic diseases is still unclear. This study is conducted in Jinhua, a city with a high prevalence of colorectal cancer in China, to assess the relationship between lifestyle and dietary factors with precursor lesions of colorectal cancer and cardiometabolic diseases.
Polyps|Cardiovascular Diseases
Numbers of participants with polyps, All polyps, From entry into the study (baseline:2018-2022) until 2028
Numbers of participants with different subtypes of polyps, Subtypes of polyps, including serrated polyps, hyperplastic polyps, sessile serrated polyps/adenoma, From entry into the study (baseline:2018-2022) until 2028|Numbers of participants with cardiometabolic diseases, Cardiometabolic diseases including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and hypertension, From entry into the study (baseline:2018-2022) until 2028
Numbers of participants died, All-cause and cause-specific mortality outcomes, From entry into the study (baseline:2018-2022) until 2028
Investigations of lifestyle and dietary factors in relation to precursor lesions of colorectal cancer and cardiometabolic diseases are limited in China. The investigators aim to collect the basic characteristics of participants at baseline, including sex, age, smoking, exercise, marriage, education level, dietary factors and so on, to assess the associations between lifestyle and dietary factors with precursor lesions of colorectal cancer and cardiometabolic diseases. This large cohort - the Lanxi Pre-colorectal Cancer Cohort (LP3C) also included several subcohorts consisting of patients with CVD, diabetes, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, obese/overweight or fatty liver disease. Results from this study will be valuable for colorectal cancer and cardiometabolic disease prevention in China.
