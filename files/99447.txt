Sensory Recovery of Reconstructed Breast With Breast Reconstructive Options
Over the past 10 years, there have been substantial improvements in breast reconstruction by plastic surgeons, and much has been achieved in aesthetic restoration after mastectomy. Advances in both microsurgery and implants have allowed for a wider variety of surgical methods, and procedural skills that minimize donor site complications have been developed.

With such satisfactory aesthetic results, interest has recently increased not only in breast reconstruction but also in sensory recovery. Due to the growing expectation of patients, sensory discomfort may decrease overall patient satisfaction with breast reconstruction despite good aesthetic results. Hence, for qualitative improvement of breast reconstruction surgery, efforts must be made to restore sensation in the reconstructed breast. There has been little research on the mechanism of sensory recovery despite its clinical importance. This study aimed to compare the degree of sensory recovery in the reconstructed breast using various reconstruction methods as well as to evaluate the status of neural regeneration with harvesting the tissues when nipple reconstruction is performed.
