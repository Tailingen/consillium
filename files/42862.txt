A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy, Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Emapalumab in Adult Patients With HLH
Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare, life-threatening condition characterized by uncontrolled hyperinflammation which may develop on the background of several clinical conditions (e.g. autoimmune disease, infection, malignancy). Emapalumab (previously referred to as NI-0501) is a monoclonal antibody neutralizing interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), a key cytokine driving the inflammation and tissue damage seen in HLH. The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of emapalumab in adult patients with secondary HLH.
Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytoses
DRUG: Emapalumab-Lzsg
Overall Response, Achievement of either a Complete or Partial Response

Complete Response is adjudicated if the following are observed:

* No fever = body temperature \<37.5°C
* Normal spleen size
* No cytopenia = Absolute Neutrophil Counts \>=1.0x10\^9/L and platelet count \>=100x10\^9/L \[absence of G-CSF and transfusion support must be documented for at least 4 days to report no cytopenia\]
* No hyperferritinemia = serum level is \<2000 µg/L
* No evidence of coagulopathy, i.e., normal D-Dimer and/or normal (\>150 mg/dL) fibrinogen levels
* No neurological and CSF abnormalities attributed to HLH
* No sustained worsening of sCD25 (as indicated by at least two consecutive measurements that are \>2-fold higher than baseline)

Partial Response is adjudicated if there is an improvement (\>50% change from baseline or normalization) of at least 3 HLH clinical and laboratory criteria (including Central Nervous System abnormalities)., Week 4

Study NI-0501-10 is an open-label, single arm, multicenter, Phase 2/3 interventional study.

The study enrolls adult patients with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), specifically newly diagnosed patients with malignancy-associated HLH (M-HLH), and newly diagnosed or previously treated patients with non-malignancy-associated HLH.
