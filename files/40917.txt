Safety and Efficacy of Tisotumab Vedotin Monotherapy & in Combination With Other Cancer Agents in Subjects With Cervical Cancer
This is an open label, multi-center trial of tisotumab vedotin monotherapy and in combination with bevacizumab, pembrolizumab, or carboplatin in subjects with recurrent or stage IVB cervical cancer.

The trial consists of two-parts a dose escalation part and an expansion part. The expansion part of the trial will be initiated once the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of the combinations have been determined in the dose escalation part.
Cervical Cancer
DRUG: Tisotumab Vedotin|DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Carboplatin
Dose escalation: Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), To establish the MTD and RP2D of tisotumab vedotin in combination, DLTs will be identified during the first treatment cycle (21 day cycles)|Dose expansion: Objective Response Rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), Objective response is defined as confirmed partial response (PR) or complete response (CR), approximately 2 years
Number of adverse events (AEs), Any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial participant whether or not considered related to the medicinal product., up to 2 years|Dose escalation: ORR per RECIST v1.1, Objective response is defined as confirmed PR or CR., approximately 2 years|Duration of Response (DOR) per RECIST v1.1 by investigator assessment, Will be calculated from the date of initial documentation of a response (CR or PR) to the date of first documented evidence of progressive disease (PD) or death., approximately 2 years|Time to Response (TTR) per RECIST v1.1 by investigator assessment, Will be calculated from the date of the first dose to the date of the initial documentation of response (CR or PR)., approximately 2 years|Progression free survival (PFS) per RECIST v1.1 by investigator assessment, The time from the date of the first trial drug administration to the date of the first documented disease progression or death due to any cause., approximately 2 years|Overall Survival (OS), The time from the date of the first trial drug administration to the date of death due to any cause., approximately 2 years|Maximum concentration (Cmax) (All Arms except G), Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameter, Up to 42 days|Cmax (Arm G only), PK parameter, Up to 2 years|Trough Concentration (Ctrough) (All Arms), PK parameter, Up to 2 years|Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) (All Arms except G), PK parameter, Through 21 days after first dose|AUC (Arm G only), PK parameter, Through 8 days after first dose|Anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), Up to 2 years
The dose escalation part will occur in participants with cervical cancer who have progressed during or after standard of care therapy and who are intolerant or ineligible to receive standard of care treatments. Arm A will be conducted by escalating doses of both tisotumab vedotin and bevacizumab. Dose escalations of the tisotumab vedotin + pembrolizumab and tisotumab vedotin + carboplatin combinations (Arms B and C, respectively) will be conducted by combining fixed doses of either pembrolizumab or carboplatin with increasing doses of tisotumab vedotin.

The dose expansion part of this study (Arms D through H) will be conducted in 2 populations: participants with cervical cancer who have not received prior systemic therapy for recurrent or stage IVB cervical cancer (Arms D, E, and H) and participants with cervical cancer who have progressed on or after at least 1 but no more than 2 prior systemic therapies (Arms F and G).

Participants enrolled to Arms D, E, F and H will receive the RP2D of tisotumab vedotin established in the dose escalation part. Participants enrolled to Arm G will receive tisotumab vedotin weekly (at a dose lower than subjects in all other Arms) for three weeks and 1 week off (28-day treatment cycle).
