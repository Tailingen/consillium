A Study to Learn About the Safety of BESPONSA Injection in Pediatric Patients With Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia.
The purpose of this study is to learn about the safety of BESPONSA for pediatric patients. .

BESPONSA is approved for treatment of relapsed or refractory CD22-positive acute lymphocytic leukemia for pediatric patients. A type of leukemia (blood cancer) that comes on quickly and is fast growing.

The registration criteria for this study are:

* Never used BESPONSA before
* \<18 years at the start of treatment with BESPONSA

All patients in this study will receive BESPONSA according to the prescriptions.

Patients will be followed up as follow.

* Treatment phase: From the day of treatment initiation (Day 1) to Day 28 post-treatment to collect information on safety (e.g., adverse events).
* Follow-up phase: From Day 29 post-treatment to Week 52 to collect information on VOD/SOS.
