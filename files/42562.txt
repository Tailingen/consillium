Study of Natural Killer Cells in Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer: Relationship With Survival and Response Time to Castration
Prospective research of Natural Killer cells as predictive biomarkers to stratify patients likely to have longer response time to castration.
Metastatic Prostate Cancer
OTHER: Blood samples
Response time to castration, Time of occurrence of:

* confirmed PSA rise + serum testosterone \< 0.50 ng/mL
* and/or radiological progression according to the modified PCWG2 criteria (progression according to the RECIST criteria v1.1 or documented by the appearance of at least 2 new lesions on the bone scan), every 6 months during 3 years-follow up|Survival, every 6 months during 3 and 5 years-follow up
Level of alcaline phosphatase, at diagnostic (before inclusion in the study) and at time of treatment for progression in the course of 3 years-follow-up|Tumor volume, at diagnostic (before inclusion in the study)
The main objective is to validate prospectively the results of a retrospective study showing a correlation between the level of NKp30 and NKp46 receptor-activators expression on the surface of NK cells and 1) the survival time, 2) the response time to castration in patients with metastatic prostate cancer.

Prospective monocenter, open-label study.

During a visit in the frame of management of the disease, a single blood sample will be collected. Patients will then have a standard care follow-up for a period of 5 years. Follow up data (death, progression) will be collected every 6 months.
