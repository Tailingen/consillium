A Study of the Safety and Activity of the MEK Inhibitor Given Together With the AKT Inhibitor to Patients With Multiple Myeloma or Solid Tumor Cancers
The purpose of this study is to determine whether the MEK inhibitor and the AKT inhibitor can be given in combination and if the combination is effective treatment for patients with solid tumors, including breast cancer and endometrial cancer, and for patients with multiple myeloma.
Cancer
DRUG: GSK1120212|DRUG: GSK2110183
Part 1: Safety and tolerability in first 4 weeks as determined by the number of patients with adverse events, serious adverse events, dose reductions or delays, withdrawals due to toxicities and changes in lab values and vital signs from baseline, Adverse events, serious adverse events, dose reductions or delays, withdrawals due to toxicities and changes in laboratory values and vital signs, Weekly during first four weeks.|Part 2A: Number of patients whose disease responds to study drugs, as determined by Overall Response Rate (ORR), Defined as stringent complete response, complete response, very good partial response, or partial response, using the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma, Every four weeks for up to one year.|Part 2B: Number of patients whose disease responds to study drugs, as determined by Overall response rate (ORR), Defined as confirmed complete response or confirmed partial response rate, using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v 1.1, Until disease progression or for up to one year.|Part 1: Safety and tolerability in continuation as determined by the number of patients with adverse events, serious adverse events, dose reductions or delays, withdrawals due to toxicities and changes in lab values and vital signs from baseline, Adverse events, serious adverse events, dose reductions or delays, withdrawals due to toxicities and changes in laboratory values and vital signs, Every four weeks for up to one year.
Part 1: Profile of pharmacokinetic parameters following repeat-dose administration of GSK1120212 and GSK2110183 in combination versus repeat-dose administration of monotherapy GSK2110183 and GSK1120212, Parameters include: AUC(0-tau), Ctau, Cmax, and tmax, Day 15 and Day 29 at predose and 1h, 2h, 3h, 4h, 6h, 8h 11h, 18h and 24h postdose|Part 2A: Number of patients whose disease responds to study drugs, as shown by PFS; duration of response; change from baseline measures in biomarkers in the PI3K/ATK and MAPK pathways; genetic alterations in PI3K/AKT/RAS/RAF pathway, Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the interval between date of randomization and the earliest date of disease progression or death due to any cause; duration of response is defined as the time from first documented evidence of response until time of first documented disease progression; biomarkers in the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways, eg pS6RP, pAKT, p-ERK, pRAS40, as measured in bone marrow aspirates/biopsies., Every 4 weeks|Part 2B: Number of patients whose disease responds to study drugs, as shown by PFS; duration of response; change from baseline measures in biomarkers in the PI3K/ATK and MAPK pathways; genetic alterations in PI3K/AKT/RAS/RAF pathway, PFS is defined as the interval between date of randomization and the earliest date of disease progression or death due to any cause; duration of response is defined as the time from first documented evidence of complete or partial response until time of first documented disease progression or death due to any cause; biomarkers in the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways, eg phosphS6RP, p-ERK, pPRAS40, pAKT measured in tumor tissue., Every 8 weeks
This is an open-label, two part, Phase I/II study to investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and clinical activity of the MEK inhibitor GSK1120212 administered in combination with the AKT inhibitor GSK2110183 in subjects with solid tumors and multiple myeloma.

In Part 1, the safety and tolerability of a range of doses for GSK1120212 and GSK2110183 dosed in combination will be investigated; pharmacokinetics will also be analyzed to determine whether there is a drug-drug interaction between GSK1120212 and GSK2110183 when dosed in combination.

The second part of the study will focus on evaluation of the clinical efficacy of the combination as well as the pharmacodynamic response in subjects with proteasome-refractory multiple myeloma (Part 2A) or solid tumors, putatively endometrial and triple negative breast cancer (Part 2B).
