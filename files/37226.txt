Radiofrequency in Differentiated Thyroid Cancer Metastatic Lymph Node: Prospective Study of Safety and Efficacy
Radiofrequency (RF) could be technically feasible and effective in the treatment of lymph node metastases of differentiated thyroid cancer. It could constitute a minimally invasive and feasible therapeutic alternative in ambulatory, allowing a reduction of the tumoral volume sufficient to limit the symptoms even to induce a tumor remission, a normalization of the tumoral markers and a better quality of life.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the anti-tumor echographic efficacy at 12 months of radiofrequency on lymph node (LN) metastasis of thyroid cancer
Differentiated Thyroid Cancer
DEVICE: Radiofrequency (RF star electrode electrode_Fixed)
Treatment response., Treatment success wil; be defined on the following three criteria that should be all fulfilled

* Loss of metastatic aspect on ultrasonography
* LN decreased volume at least 50%
* no vascularization in Doppler, 12 months
Percentage of patients with non-suspicious cyto-punction of treated LN at 6 months after RF, 6 months|Percentage of patients without any new suspicious cervical lesion, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months.|Response time, response time for partial response, major response and disappearance of lymph node at ultrasound., within 38 months|Reduction in thyroglobulin level in blood, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months|Reduction in thyroglobulin antibody level in blood, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months|Percentage of patient in tumor response, Tumor response is defined according American Thyroid Association's criteria, 12 and 24 months|Percentage of patients without any new therapeutic event, 12 and 24 months|Percentage of patients with good immediate tolerance, day 0|Percentage of (either expected or unexpected) clinical complications, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months|Percentage of patients who had a RF complete procedure, day 0|Percentage of patients who had a RF incomplete procedure, day 0|Anxiety, visual analog scale coted by the patient, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months|36-item Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), it measures the quality of life, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months|EuroQol (EQ-5D), EQ-5D is a standardized instrument for measuring generic health status. Health status is measured in terms of five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression., 3, 6, 12 and 24 months
