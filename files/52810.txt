This is a single-arm, open-label, multicentre phase II study evaluating the safety and efficacy of the combination of the G.O.N.O. FOLFOXIRI regimen with bevacizumab as first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer.
Colorectal Cancer Metastatic
DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Irinotecan|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin
Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS was calculated from the day of treatment start to the first observation of disease progression or death from any cause., PFS rate at 10 months from study entry
Response rate (RR), Response evaluation was performed every 8 weeks from the day of treatment start until disease progression for each enrolled patient for the full lenght of the study. Response evaluation was performed according to RECIST criteria. Responses were subsequently confirmed by a central review., 2007-2010|Overall survival (OS), OS was calculated from the day of treatment start until death from any cause for each enrolled patient for the full lenght of the study, censoring patients who had not died at the last date known to be alive., 2007-2010|Number of Participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, During the full lenght of first-line treatment, number of enrolled patients reporting adverse events was recorded. Adverse events were evaluated according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (version 3.0)., 2007-2010|Evaluation of potential surrogate markers predictive of bevacizumab activity, During first-line therapy and at disease progression., 2007-2010
