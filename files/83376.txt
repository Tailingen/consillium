MITO 35B: Olaparib Beyond Progression Compared to Platinum Chemotherapy After Secondary Cytoreductive Surgery in Recurrent Ovarian Cancer Patients.
MITO 35b is designed as randomized, open label, phase III trial that aims to assess the efficacy of olaparib maintenance beyond progression compered to standard platinum-based chemotherapy after secondary cytoreductive surgery.

The target population of this study are ovarian cancer patients who experience a disease recurrence or progression to a first line maintenance therapy with PARPi; at progression patients must have received a secondary cytoreduction according to clinical practice.
