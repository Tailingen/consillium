An Exploratory Study of RD140 Injection in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma or Plasma Cell Leukemia
This is a single-center, open clinical study, divided into two phases of dose escalation and dose expansion, to observe the safety and efficacy of RD140 injection at different doses in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma or plasmacytic leukemia.

This study is divided into two stages: dose escalation and dose extension. The "3+3" dose escalation design was adopted in the dose escalation stage, and three dose escalation dose groups of 1.0×10\^5 CART(Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cell) cells/kg, 3.0×10\^5 CART cells/kg and 6.0×10\^5 CART cells/kg were preset. Each dose group level included 3-6 subjects with a single dose. The objective is to preliminarily observe the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and immunogenicity of RD140 injection at different doses in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) or plasma cell leukemia, and provide evidence for dose expansion phase.

In the dose expansion phase, 1 to 2 dose groups were selected for expansion based on the dose escalation phase, and 3 to 6 subjects were included in each extended dose group to further evaluate the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of RD140 injection in the treatment of RRMM or plasma cell leukemia.
