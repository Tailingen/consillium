Trial of Poor Performance Status Patients (ToPPS)
The purpose of this trial is to evaluate three treatment regimens in patients with stage IIIB/IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) with a performance status of 2 and who were not previously treated.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Pemetrexed|DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Carboplatin
Progression Free Survival (PFS), The Length of Time, in Months, That Patients Were Alive From Their First Date of Protocol Treatment Until Worsening of Their Disease. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., 18 months
Overall Response Rate (ORR), the Number of Patients Who Experience an Objective Benefit From Treatment, Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by MRI or CT: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., 18 months|Time to Progression (TTP), The Length of Time, in Months, That Patients Remain Alive From Their First Date of Protocol Treatment Until Worsening of Their Disease. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., 18 months|Time to Treatment Failure (TTTF), Defined as the Length of Time, in Months, that Patients were Alive from the Date of First Treatment Until Treatment Discontinuation for Any Reason., 18 months|Overall Survival (OS), The Length of Time, in Months, That Patients Were Alive From Their First Date of Protocol Treatment Until Death, 18 months|6-month and 12-month Overall Survival Probability, Overall Survival = The Length of Time, in Months, That Patients Were Alive From Their First Date of Protocol Treatment Until Death, 12 months
This randomized, Phase II trial will evaluate three treatment regimens in patients with previously untreated stage IIIB/IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) and a performance status (PS) of 2. Patients will be randomized to either pemetrexed alone, pemetrexed and bevacizumab, or pemetrexed, carboplatin, and bevacizumab in a 1:1:1 fashion. All 3 regimens should be tolerable in poor performance status patients with advanced NSCLC. The 3-drug regimen (pemetrexed/carboplatin/bevacizumab) has been modified by lowering the dose of carboplatin, in order to minimize myelosuppression. This trial will be conducted at multiple study sites.
