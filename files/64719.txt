A Real-World Study of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors and Chemotherapy for Advanced Esophageal Cancer
The role of preoperative chemotherapy as standard therapy is well-established for advanced esophageal cancer. Immunotherapeutic agents such as Immune checkpoint inhibitors has been shown to improve objective response rate in solid tumors. However, there is a paucity of data regarding the efficacy and safety of preoperative immunotherapy plus chemotherapy in esophageal cancer patients in real-world practice. This study set out to investigate whether the combination of preoperative chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors is beneficial to improve the objective response rate as well as the pathological complete response rate in a real-world scenario.
Esophageal Cancer
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective Response Rate, Up to 24 weeks|Safety as measured by number of participants with Grade 3 and 4 adverse events, Number of Grade 3 and 4 adverse events as defined by CTCAE v5.0, Up to 12 weeks|Feasibility of immunochemotherapy defined as at least 80% of the patients completed all planned courses, The feasibility of immunochemotherapy was defined as at least 80% of the patients completed all planned courses., Up to 36 weeks
