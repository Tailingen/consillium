Sacituzumab Govitecan +/- Pembrolizumab in Metastatic TNBC
This research study involves testing the safety and efficacy of an investigational intervention for patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) that has spread, or metastasized, to other parts the body and is PD-L1-negative.

The names of the study interventions involved in this study are:

* Sacituzumab govitecan (Trodelvy™;IMMU-132)
* Pembrolizumab (Keytruda®; MK-3475)
Breast Cancer|Triple Negative Breast Cancer|PD-L1 Negative
DRUG: Sacituzumab Govitecan|DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Progression Free Survival (PFS), Compare PFS of patients randomized to receive sacituzumab govitecan in combination with pembrolizumab (Arm A) versus those randomized to receive sacituzumab govitecan monotherapy (Arm B).

Defined as the time from study randomization to disease progression, per RECIST 1.1 or medical judgment, the latter based on established clinical parameters, such as rising tumor markers and physical exam evidence of progression, i.e. worsening chest wall disease, or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first., 3 years
Overall Survival (OS), Compare the efficacy of sacituzumab govitecan with pembrolizumab to that of sacituzumab govitecan alone by assessing Overall Survival (OS), defined as the time from randomization (or registration) to death due to any cause, or censored at date last known alive, will be reported with Kaplan Meier estimates., 3 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Compare the efficacy of sacituzumab govitecan with pembrolizumab to that of sacituzumab govitecan alone by assessing Objective Response Rate by RECIST 1.1., 3 years|Duration of response (DOR), Compare the efficacy of sacituzumab govitecan with pembrolizumab to that of sacituzumab govitecan alone by assessing the duration of response (the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented or death due to any cause. Participants without events reported are censored at the last disease evaluation)., 3 years|Time to objective response (TTOR), Compare the efficacy of sacituzumab govitecan with pembrolizumab to that of sacituzumab govitecan alone by assessing the time to objective response defined as the time from randomization to the date of the first documented CR or PR (whichever is first recorded)., 3 years|Time to progression (TTP), Compare the efficacy of sacituzumab govitecan with pembrolizumab to that of sacituzumab govitecan alone by assessing Time to progression (TTP) defined as the time from randomization (or registration) to progression, or censored at date of last disease evaluation for those without progression reported., 3 years|Clinical benefit rate (CBR), Compare the efficacy of sacituzumab govitecan with pembrolizumab to that of sacituzumab govitecan alone by assessing Clinical benefit rate (CBR) according to RECIST 1.1, defined as CR, PR or stable disease for ≥ 24 weeks., 3 years|Number of Participants with Treatment-Related Adverse Events as Assessed by CTCAE v5.0, Evaluate the safety and tolerability of sacituzumab govitecan and pembrolizumab compared to sacituzumab govitecan alone by monitoring adverse events, including immune-related adverse events., 3 years
This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug or a combination of investigational drugs to learn whether the drug or drug combination works in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drug or drug combination is being studied.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Sacituzumab Govitecan for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, but it is currently approved only for patients who have had 2 or more prior regimens for metastatic disease. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Pembrolizumab for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, but it is currently approved only for patients with PD-L1-positive metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.

In this research study, we are:

* Studying Sacituzumab Govitecan alone or in combination with Pembrolizumab as a possible treatment for patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancers that are PD-L1-negative.
* Sacituzumab Govitecan is composed of a chemotherapy drug, called Irinotecan, which is attached to an antibody. Antibodies are proteins normally made by the immune system that bind to substances that don't belong in the body to prevent harm. The antibody in this study binds to certain types of cancer tumors, including triple-negative breast tumors.
* Pembrolizumab is an immunotherapy, called an anti-PD-1 or a checkpoint inhibitor, and is an antibody (a type of human protein) designed to allow the body's own immune system to seek out and destroy tumors. It has been used in previous research studies to treat breast cancer, where it has been shown to be effective.
* The overall goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of either Sacituzumab Govitecan alone or in combination with Pembrolizumab, in delaying the worsening of triple-negative breast cancers that are PD-L1-negative.

The research study procedures include: screening for eligibility, research blood collections, at least two research biopsies, paired research stool collections, questionnaires, data collection, and study treatment including evaluations and follow up visits.

Participants will be randomized into one of two groups.

* Group A: Sacituzumab Govitecan on days 1 and 8 and Pembrolizumab on day 1 of a 21-day cycle
* Group B: Sacituzumab Govitecan alone on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle

Participants will receive study treatment for as long as they are benefitting from this therapy. Participants will be followed for the rest of their life.

It is expected that about 110 people will take part in this research study.
