Objective Examination Score, Analyzed with a paired samples t-test., Up to 8 weeks
Oncology Resident Confidence Rate, Scored using Likert scales and analyzed with non-parametric tests., Week 1 - 8|Oncology Resident Perceived Competence Rate, Scored using Likert scales and analyzed with non-parametric tests., Week 1 - 8
This study involves both the development of a novel learning tool, the Radiation Treatment Plan Evaluation Learning Module, as well as a pilot program to validate this tool as an effective resource to teach treatment plan review and optimization to radiation oncology residents.

Stud procedures include screening for eligibility and completion of surveys and oncology examinations.

Participation is expected to last about 6-8 weeks.

It is expected about 20 radiation oncology resident physicians will participate in the study.
