Stereotactic Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Liver Metastases
RATIONALE: Stereotactic radiation therapy may be able to send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue.

PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of stereotactic radiation therapy in treating patients with liver metastases.
Metastatic Cancer
PROCEDURE: quality-of-life assessment|RADIATION: stereotactic body radiation therapy
Maximum tolerated dose
Toxicity profile|Adverse events profile|Quality of life as measured by the Brief Pain Inventory and Brief Fatigue Inventory|Response profile|Physical exam results
OBJECTIVES:

* To identify the maximum tolerated dose of stereotactic radiation therapy in patients with hepatic metastases.
* To determine the toxicity and adverse events profile of this patient population.
* To examine patient response, treatment effect on blood chemistry, and hematology values and patient quality-of-life in this patient population.

OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to stereotactic radiotherapy level (1 vs 2 vs 3) and the number of liver lesions present (1-2 vs 3-5 vs \> 5).

Patients undergo percutaneous placement of metallic fiducial markers within the liver for stereotactic targeting and planning. Patients then undergo 1 fraction of stereotactic radiotherapy within 1 week of the marker placement.

Patients complete Brief Pain Inventory and Brief Fatigue Inventory questionnaires to assess quality of life at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8 and months 3, 6, and 9 after completion of study treatment.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for at least 8 weeks.
