The First-in-human Phase I Trial of PU-H71 in Patients With Advanced Malignancies
NOTE: This study is now recruiting only patients with Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPN). Dose escalation has been completed.

The purpose of this study is to test a new drug, called PU-H71 for the first time in humans, to find out what effects, good or bad, this new drug has on the patient and the cancer at different dose levels. PU-H71 blocks a protein called Heat Shock Protein-90 (Hsp90). Hsp90 is found in both normal and cancer cells, but may be more important in cancer cells. Attacking Hsp90 can stop the function of certain proteins that are needed for cancer cells to survive. The diseases that are part of this study may be especially sensitive to attacking Hsp90, and the investigators have seen signs of disease control in patients with MPN. This study is currently enrolling a cohort expansion for patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN).
Metastatic Solid Tumor|Lymphoma|Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPN)
DRUG: PU-H71
To assess the safety of PU-H71 in patients with advanced malignancies., Toxicity will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), Version 4.0. All patients enrolled who receive study drug will be eligible for these analyses., 2 years|To assess the tolerability of PU-H71 in patients with advanced malignancies., Toxicity will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), Version 4.0., 2 years|To assess the pharmacokinetics of PU-H71 in patients with advanced malignancies., Blood will be drawn at the multiple time points for radioactive pharmacokinetic and metabolite analyses of 124I-PUH71, The investigators anticipate these time points to be: 5 min (+mins), 3-4, 18-24 and 44-48 hours post-injection.|To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) based on toxicity analysis., Toxicity will be monitored using NCI- Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version (4.0).Patients receiving at least 3 out of 4 planned doses of study drug developing a drug-related toxicity will be eligible for these analyses., 2 years
To assess anti-tumor activity as defined by response rate, complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), duration of response, and progression free survival (PFS). Patients with measurable disease will be eligible for these analyses., 2 years|To evaluate 124I-PU-H71 as a non-invasive means to determine tumor pharmacokinetics and intra-tumoral concentration, In a selected group of patients with advanced malignancies. All patients who undergo planned imaging will be eligible for this analysis., 2 years
