Brain Function in Children Previously Treated on Clinical Trials POG-9605 and POG-9201
RATIONALE: Assessing the effects of methotrexate on brain function in children may improve the ability to plan treatment and decrease side effects.

PURPOSE: Clinical trial to compare brain function of children who have been previously treated with methotrexate.
Long-term Effects Secondary to Cancer Therapy in Children|Neurotoxicity
PROCEDURE: management of therapy complications
Percentage of patients with severe intelligence deficit as evidenced by either a verbal or performance IQ below 85, Length of study
Compare the groups for descriptive purposes, Quantitative scales: IQ (WISC III or WPPSI-R, depending on the age of the child), Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning (4 subscales), Conner's Continuous Performance Test (Attention/Concentration), Woodcock Johnson Revised Processing Speed Cluster, NEPSP Tower Tests (Executive Functioning), and VSI (Visual-Motor Integration)., Length of study
OBJECTIVES:

* Compare the incidence of neuropsychological abnormalities and leukoencephalopathy in children previously treated with methotrexate on protocols POG-9605 versus POG-9201.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

More than 3 years after completion of therapy, patients undergo 9 different tests to assess intelligence, memory, learning, attention, concentration, processing of information, functioning, and visual-motor integration. Patients also undergo MRI of the head.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30-54 patients previously treated on protocol POG-9201 will be accrued for this study. A total of 60-108 patients previously treated on protocol POG-9605 will be accrued for this study.
