A Study Comparing the Pharmacokinetics (PK) of ABP 501 40 mg/0.4 mL (ABP 501-HCF) and ABP 501 40 mg/0.8 ml (ABP 501-LCF) in Healthy Adult Participants
To determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) comparability of ABP 501 40 mg/0.4 mL (ABP 501-HCF) compared to ABP 501 40 mg/0.8 mL (ABP 501-LCF) following single-dose subcutaneous (SC) injection, as assessed principally by area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) from time 0 extrapolated to infinity (AUCinf) and maximum observed serum concentration (Cmax) in healthy adult participants.
