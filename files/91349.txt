Study of Activated Cytokine-induced Killer Armed With Bispecific Antibody for Advanced Breast Cancer
This is a phase II Randomized comparison clinical trial of activated CIK armed with anti-CD3-MUC1 bispecific antibody for advanced breast cancer. And the aim of this research is to study the clinical efficacy and safety of activated CIK armed with anti-CD3-MUC1 bispecific antibody for breast cancer.

Primary breast carcinoma is one of the most common malignancies in China, ranking first in all malignant tumors of women.immunotherapy is considered to be one of the most promising means of human against cancer. This is a phase II clinical trial of single- center, The investigators plan to recruit for 90 patients with advanced breast cancer,and all patients are divided into three groups.one group will receive cryotherapy, one group will receive conventional therapyï¼Œand the rest one will receive mixed liquor of activated CIK and anti-CD3-MUC1 bispecific antibody together with cryotherapy.

The result of this study was statistic and analysed with the record of Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors(RECIST1.1) evaluation standard.
