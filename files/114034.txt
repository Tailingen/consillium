Study of CP-675,206 in Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)-Resistant Bladder Cancer
The purpose of this study is to find out the highest safe dose of the investigational drug CP-675,206 when given in combination with BCG therapy to patients who have experienced recurrent superficial bladder cancer after standard BCG treatment.

In addition, the study will look to see if taking CP 675,206 generates an immune response and evaluate how the drug affects superficial bladder cancer.
