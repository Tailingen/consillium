Patients With Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma Comparing KTd vs. KRd Induction Therapy and Investigating a K-mono Maintenance Strategy
This is a randomized, 2-arm phase II, multi-center study to evaluate the overall response rate in newly diagnosed, transplant ineligible patients receiving 9 cycles induction therapy with either KTd or KRd followed by randomization to either carfilzomib maintenance treatment for 12 months or to observation only. Maintenance is given for 12 cycles or progression of disease, whatever occurs first.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Carfilzomib|DRUG: Thalidomide|DRUG: Lenalidomide|DRUG: Dexamethasone
Response Rates, Overall response rate (ORR) will be assessed according to International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria to determine the ORR in patients NDMM after receiving 9 cycles induction therapy with either carfilzomib in combination with thalidomide and dexamethasone or carfilzomib in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, 36 weeks after start of induction treatment (9 cycles, each cycle is 28 days)
Feasibility of a carfilzomib monotherapy maintenance, Feasibility of maintenance therapy with carfilzomib will be investigated in comparison with observation only strategy by observing treatment and visit compliance (listing withdrawals, treatment/visit delays and drug modifications)., after 12 months of maintenance therapy or observation only|Safety (adverse events) of a carfilzomib monotherapy maintenance, Safety will be assessed by the type, incidence, severity (CTCAE v 4.0), and relatedness of adverse events (AEs) to treatment and by the descriptive analysis of laboratory parameters related to safety. Adverse events will be summarized by presenting the number and percentage (as appropriate) of patients having any adverse event by body system, type of adverse event, and maximum severity., after 12 months of maintenance therapy or observation only|Overall response rate (efficacy) of a carfilzomib monotherapy maintenance, After 12 months maintenance treatment or observation overall response rate (ORR, ratio of the number of patients with CR to partial response (PR) divided by the number of all patients evaluable for response) will be analyzed descriptively and compared using a chi\^2 test without continuity correction. A one-sided 97.5% confidence interval for the difference in ORR will be calculated., after 12 months of maintenance therapy or observation only|Response, The updated IMWG response criteria will be applied for response evaluation in all patients; this also includes minimal residual disease (MRD) evaluation; thus, response rates will be assessed qualitatively and quantitatively; MRD testing will be performed in all patients achieving complete remission (CR) and in patients which are in a CR at the end of maintenance, after 21 months (9 months induction therapy and 12 months maintenance)|Overall survival (OS), To determine Overall Survival (OS) in patients with NDMM ineligible for transplantation receiving either KTd versus KRd induction therapy and sub-sequent being randomised either to maintenance arm with carfilzomib or to control only for a maximum period of 12 months., after 21 months (9 months induction therapy and 12 months maintenance)|Progression free survival (PFS), Response rates will be assessed qualitatively and quantitatively (PR, VGPR, CR, sCR, MRD according to IMWG Rajkumar 2011), after 9 months induction therapy|Safety and tolerability (adverse events) of induction and maintenance treatment, Safety and tolerability of KTd and KRd followed by randomization to carfilzomib maintenance for a maximum period of 12 months or observation only will be assessed by the type, incidence, severity (CTCAE v 4.0), and relatedness of AEs to treatment and by the descriptive analysis of laboratory parameters related to safety. Adverse events will be summarized by presenting the number and percentage (as appropriate) of patients having any adverse event by body system, type of adverse event, and maximum severity., after 21 months (9 months induction therapy and 12 months maintenance)|Changes in quality of life (QoL), Changes in quality of life will be analyzed by using the cancer patient-specific questionnaire EORTC-QLQ-C30. Measures will be calculated and analyzed descriptively, and compared between treatment groups using a Mann-Whitney U-test for unpaired observations., after 21 months (9 months induction therapy and 12 months maintenance)|Changes in quality of life (QoL) using multiple myeloma specific questionnaire, Changes in quality of life will be analyzed by using the multiple myeloma-specific questionnaire "EORTC-QLQ-MY20". Measures will be calculated and analyzed descriptively, and compared between treatment groups using a Mann-Whitney U-test for unpaired observations., after 21 months (9 months induction therapy and 12 months maintenance)|Changes of general health status, Changes in general health status will be analyzed by using the questionnaires "EQ-5D-5L". QoL measures will be calculated and analyzed descriptively, and compared between treatment groups using a Mann-Whitney U-test for unpaired observations., after 21 months (9 months induction therapy and 12 months maintenance)
Multiple myeloma, a clonal neoplastic proliferation of plasma cells, is the second most common hematologic malignancy and accounts for approximately 72,000 annual deaths worldwide. There are an estimated 11,000 deaths per year in the US and more than 19,000 deaths per year in Europe.

This study examines the efficacy of carfilzomib (K) in combination with thalidomide, an old, well established first line immunomodulatory imide drugs (IMiD) in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma versus K in combination with lenalidomide in 1st line. This trial will also evaluate the adherence to and the safety of a thalidomide containing triplet by using a non-neurotoxic proteasome inhibitor. Moreover, weekly dosing of carfilzomib addresses the need for a more convenient dosing schedule. Finally, yet importantly, this trial will assess the efficacy of a less cost intensive triplet and a strategy to keep lenalidomide as backup for later lines.. The second part of the study - after completing 9 cycles induction therapy with KTd or KRd - patients of both arms will be pooled and again randomized 1:1 stratified by induction therapy into two arms (K-monotherapy versus observation-only).
