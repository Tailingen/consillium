Evaluation of the Results of Simultaneous Pancreatic and Hepatic Resections for Metastatic Neuroendocrine Tumors.
The indications for synchronous liver resection for metastatic neuroendocrine tumors of pancreatic origin remain debated and poorly described in the literature.

The reported mortality of this type of simultaneous resection remains very high, especially when a cephalic duodenopancreatectomy is associated with a hepatic resection (up to 40%). The benefit in terms of survival remains to be evaluated. The ReSiPaTNE study proposes to create a retrospective cohort of simultaneous pancreatic and hepatic resections for metastatic neuroendocrine tumors in order to evaluate the short and long term results of this type of resection. The evaluation of the results of this type of resection may be useful for the selection of patients for treatment.
