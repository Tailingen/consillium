Study of Preoperative Radiation Therapy in Participants With Resectable Recurrent Abdominal Adrenocortical Carcinoma
Background:

Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare cancer of the adrenal glands. ACC often returns after tumors are removed with surgery. Less than 35% of people with ACC survive 5 years after diagnosis.

Objective:

To test a new type of radiation therapy (external beam radiation therapy \[EBRT\]) before surgery in people with ACC.

Eligibility:

People aged 18 years and older with ACC that came back after treatment but may be safely removed with surgery.

Design:

Participants will be screened. They will have a physical exam with blood and urine tests. They will have tests of their heart function. They will have imaging scans. A small sample of tumor tissue may be collected if one is not available. They will undergo laparoscopy: Small incisions will be made in the abdomen so that a thin tube with a light and camera can be inserted to view the organs.

EBRT comes from a machine that aims radiation at tumors. Participants will receive EBRT 5 days a week for 2 to 3 weeks. Visits will last 30 to 60 minutes.

Participants will undergo surgery to remove their tumors 4 to 8 weeks after they finish EBRT. They will stay in the hospital 1 to 3 weeks after surgery.

Participants will have follow-up visits for 10 years after surgery.

Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and safety and toxicity profile of preoperative external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) with or without standard-of-care mitotane, before surgical resection, Fraction of participants with a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) will be reported at each dose level, from the start of EBRT and for 30 days after its completion

Background:

* Although surgical resection is the treatment of choice in participants with localized or regionalized primary and recurrent abdominal adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), loco-regional recurrence following complete resection of ACC occurs in 50-80% of the participants, most commonly in the first five years postoperatively.
* Retrospective single institutional series report improvement in local control with postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) in selected participants with ACC.
* Preoperative RT is used in several abdominal and retroperitoneal malignancies to improve local control. There is no prospective data available for the use of this treatment approach for participants with resectable ACC.
* We hypothesize that preoperative RT alone is safe and can result in a lower loco-regional recurrence in participants with resectable recurrent ACC with no peritoneal carcinomatosis. Thus, this phase I dose-escalation trial aims to evaluate the safety and feasibility of preoperative radiation in participants with resectable recurrent ACC.
* Health-related quality of life (QOL) is a well-accepted tool to measure the outcome of cancer treatments. SF-36 v2 questionnaire has been frequently used to evaluate the QOL in participants with cancer. There is no study evaluating the difference in QOL in participants with resectable recurrent ACC undergoing preoperative RT and surgery.

Objectives:

-To determine the maximum tolerated dose and the safety and toxicity profile of preoperative external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) with or without standard of care mitotane, before surgical resection in participants with resectable ACC

Eligibility:

* Age \>= 18 years
* Pathological confirmation of ACC with clinical evidence of abdominal recurrence
* ECOG 0-2
* Surgically resectable disease at presentation with no or limited extra-abdominal disease and without ACC peritoneal carcinomatosis based on a diagnostic laparoscopy at screening.
* The last dose of chemotherapy treatment except for mitotane more than 4 weeks prior to starting treatment with this protocol, and participants must have recovered from chemotherapy.
* No prior abdominal radiation
* No contraindication to abdominal radiotherapy

Design:

* This study will enroll up to 24 evaluable participants as follows:

  * Participants will be enrolled in Cohort 1 or 2 based on mitotane use or serum level. Up to 6-18 evaluable participants per these cohorts (i.e., resectable ACC with and without mitotane use) will be enrolled to assess the safety of 3-level dose-escalating preoperative EBRT.
  * Participants will be enrolled in Cohort 3 regardless of mitotane use or serum level, and will only start enrollment when we observe no DLTs in \> 1 participant in Cohort 1 at Dose Level 1. Up to 12 evaluable participants will be enrolled in this cohort.
* Preoperative assessment of QOL using a standardized questionnaire (SF-36 v2) will be obtained at baseline.
* Participants will be treated with preoperative external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) daily 5 days/week (M-F), followed by a planned surgical resection, 6-8 weeks after the completion of EBRT.
* A standard 3 + 3 design will be used to determine the MTD of dose-escalated EBRT, with 3 dose levels (DL1- 30 Gy delivered in 10 fractions, DL2-36 Gy in 12 fractions, DL3-42 Gy in 14 fractions).
* Postoperative surveillance imaging studies and laboratory tests will be performed every 3 months in the first 3 years, then every 6 months thereafter in years 4-10. FDG-PET scan will be performed every 6 months postoperatively in the first 3 years, then every year in years 4-10. Additional assessments may be performed if clinically indicated.
