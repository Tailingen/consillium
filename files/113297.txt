Stereotactic Radiotherapy Versus Palliative Conventional Radiotherapy for Oligoprogressive Metastatic Cancers
STOP-2 is a phase III multi-institutional double-blind randomized trial. 194 participants will be enrolled in this trial. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio between the Control Arm vs. the Experimental Arm.

Participants, enrolling oncologists, and the statistician will be blinded to trial arm assignment.

In the control arm, radiotherapy will consist of 8 Gy in 1 fraction to all sites of oligoprogression, and the experimental arm will consist of SABR treatment to all sites of oligoprogression.

Primary Objectives

* To assess the impact of SABR, compared to palliative conventional radiotherapy, on Progression-free survival on next line systemic therapy (PFS-NEST), oncologic outcomes, and Quality of Life (QOL) in participants with 1-5 oligoprogressing lesions.
* To assess the feasibility of the clinical trial in terms of accrual and success of double-blinding.

Secondary Objectives

* To evaluate and compare the impact of SABR and palliative radiation therapy on the overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), polymetastatic progression-free survival (PPFS);
* To assess and compare the proportion of participants receiving additional radiation therapy and other metastasis-directed interventions during follow-up between both arms;
* To compare the impact of SABR and palliative radiation therapy on the time to initiation of the next line of systemic therapy;
* To identify and compare the anatomic sites of disease progression between the experimental (SABR) and control (palliative radiation) arms;
* To compare the treatment related toxicity among participants in each arm;
* To evaluate and compare the quality of life among participants in each arm;
* To assess the cost-effectiveness of the experimental arm compared to the control arm.
