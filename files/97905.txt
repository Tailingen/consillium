Study of Zoledronic Acid Administered Monthly Versus Every 3 Months in Multiple Myeloma and Breast Cancer Patients Who Were Treated With Zoledronic Acid the Prior Year
The primary objective of this study is to investigate the repeat-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of zoledronic acid when administered every 4 weeks versus every 12 weeks, in patients treated with 9-20 infusions of zoledronic acid during the previous 10-15 months.
Multiple Myeloma|Breast Cancer
DRUG: Zoledronic acid
Sequential plasmas concentrations of zoledronic acid collected at 13 study visits between visit 2 to visit 17, every four (4) weeks|Sequential urine concentrations of zoledronic acid collected at 9 study visits between visit 2 to visit 13, every four (4) weeks
Pharmacodynamic outcomes will be measured by the concentration of bone resorption markers at all visits., every four (4) weeks|Efficacy outcomes will be measured throughout the study by number and time to skeletal related events (determined by bone surveys and bone scans) as well as the measurement of pain and analgesic scores., bone survey = every 12 weeks; bone scan = every 24 weeks; pain & analgesic scores = weekly prior to visit 8 (inclusive), every 4 weeks after visit 8
