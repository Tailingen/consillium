Minimal Residual Disease Response-adapted Deferral of Transplant in Dysproteinemia (MILESTONE)
This is a phase II interventional study evaluating the use of minimal residual disease by next generation sequencing to defer autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHCT) in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: DaraVRD
Number of patients who are able to attain MRD<10-5 by next generation sequencing after 6 cycles of Dara-VRD and defer AHCT., To determine the feasibility of utilizing post-induction MRD to inform transplant utilization., Baseline through 6 months
Number of patients who was MRD>10-5 that undergo AHCT and attain MRD<10-5., To determine the frequency of conversion from MRD (+) to MRD (-) status with auto-HCT., Baseline through 10 months|Progression free survival, To determine the progression free survival (PFS), Baseline through 7 years|Overall survival, To determine the frequency of overall survival (OS), Baseline through 7 years
While AHCT is an important treatment strategy for patients with multiple myeloma, from a safety standpoint, AHCT is associated with both acute toxicities that reduce quality of life and long-term toxicities that may limit life expectancy for some patients. Additionally its benefit in patients without evidence of minimal residual disease (MRD) is unknown.

We propose to examine MRD response as a strategy to defer AHCT in a systematic manner.
