A Study of Imlunestrant, Investigator's Choice of Endocrine Therapy, and Imlunestrant Plus Abemaciclib in Participants With ER+, HER2- Advanced Breast Cancer
The main purpose of this study is to measure how well imlunestrant works compared to standard hormone therapy, and how well imlunestrant with abemaciclib work compared to imlunestrant in participants with breast cancer that is estrogen receptor positive (ER+) and human epidermal receptor 2 negative (HER2-). Participants must have breast cancer that is advanced or has spread to another part of the body. Study participation could last up to 5 years.

DRUG: Imlunestrant|DRUG: Exemestane|DRUG: Fulvestrant|DRUG: Abemaciclib
Progression Free Survival (PFS) in the Intent-to-Treat (IIT) Population, PFS by investigator assessment in the IIT population, Randomization to the date of first documented progression of disease or death from any cause (estimated as up to 3 years)|PFS in the Estrogen Receptor 1 (ESR1)-mutation Detected Population, PFS by investigator assessment in ESR1-mutation detected population, Randomization to the date of first documented progression of disease or death from any cause (estimated as up to 3 years)
Overall Survival (OS) in the IIT Population, OS in the IIT population, Randomization until death from any cause (estimated as up to 5 years)|OS in the ESR1-mutation Detected Population, OS in the ESR1-mutation detected population, Randomization until death from any cause (estimated as up to 5 years)|Objective Response Rate (ORR): Percentage of Participants Who Achieve a Confirmed Best Overall Response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR), ORR, Randomization until measured progressive disease (estimated as up to 1 year)|Duration of Response (DoR), DoR, Date of CR or PR to date of disease progression or death due to any cause (estimated up to 3 years)|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR): Percentage of Participants Who Achieve a Best Overall Response of CR, PR or Stable Disease for Greater than or Equal to (â‰¥) 24 Weeks, CBR, Randomization until measured progressive disease (estimated as up to 1 year)|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS by blinded independent review, Randomization to the date of first documented progression of disease or death from any cause(estimated as up to 3 years)|Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO): Time to Worsening of "Worst Pain", Measured by the Worst Pain Numeric Rating Scale (NRS). NRS is a single item, participant-administered, 11-point horizontal scale anchored at 0 and 10, with 0 representing "no pain" and 10 representing "pain as bad as you can imagine.", Screening through follow-up (estimated as up to 3 years)|Pharmacokinetics (PK): Steady State Plasma Concentrations of Imlunestrant, PK: steady state plasma concentrations of imlunestrant, Cycle 2 to Cycle 4 (cycle = 28 days)|PK: Steady State Plasma Concentrations of Imlunestrant and Abemaciclib, PK: steady state plasma concentrations of imlunestrant and abemaciclib, Cycle 2 to Cycle 4 (cycle = 28 days)
