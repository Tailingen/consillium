High-Dose Methotrexate in Treating Young Patients With Residual Ependymoma
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as methotrexate, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well high-dose methotrexate works in treating young patients with residual ependymoma.
Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors
DRUG: methotrexate|PROCEDURE: adjuvant therapy
Activity of high-dose methotrexate at 6 weeks
Assess reasons why primary surgery is complete or incomplete at diagnosis|Feasibility and toxicity of second look surgery after course 3 at 2 months|Compare functional imaging studies of ependymomas with biological characteristics of the tumors at diagnosis
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine the activity of high-dose methotrexate as upfront-window therapy in young patients with residual ependymoma.

Secondary

* Assess the reasons why primary surgery was complete/incomplete in these patients.
* Assess the feasibility and toxicity of second-look surgery after 3 courses of high-dose methotrexate in cases where initial surgery was incomplete.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open-label study.

Patients receive high-dose methotrexate IV continuously over 24 hours on days 0, 14, and 28 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then proceed to further chemotherapy on protocol UKCCSG-CNS-9204.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 9 years.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 29 patients will be accrued for this study.
