This study was conducted using a cross-sectional analytical design, allowing the assessment of the association between various risk factors and oral cavity cancer. This study was conducted at the oncology, ENT, and oral surgery outpatient clinics at our hospital from January 2023 to December 2024. The inclusion criterion was a confirmed diagnosis of oral cavity cancer undergoing surgical intervention. Patients with oral cancer resulting from metastasis from a primary tumor located in another organ were excluded. The control group consisted of individuals attending the hospital for non-cancer-related conditions matched by age and sex to the case group.

Data were collected through structured interviews using a questionnaire designed to obtain information on subject behavior, including smoking, alcohol consumption, betel quid chewing, and oral hygiene practices. Medical records were reviewed to gather additional clinical information and to confirm the diagnosis of oral cavity cancer.

Data were analyzed using SPSS version 25. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the demographic and clinical characteristics of the study population. The chi-squared test was used to assess the significance of the association between risk factors and the presence of oral cavity cancer. Statistical significance was set at P \< 0.05. The study was approved by the Health Research Ethics Committee (registration number DP.04.03/D.XIV.6.5/191/2024).
