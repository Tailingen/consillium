Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Pomalidomide Monotherapy in Subjects With Refractory or Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pomalidomide monotherapy in subjects with refractory or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who were enrolled in study CC-4047-MM-003 (NCT01311687) and discontinued treatment with high-dose dexamethasone due to disease progression.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: pomalidomide
Percentage of Participants With an Objective Response According to International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Uniform Response Criteria Based on Investigator Assessment, Objective response defined as a best overall response of stringent complete response (SCR), complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR) or partial response (PR) based on Investigator Assessment.

SCR: CR and normal free light chain (FLC) ratio and no clonal cells in bone marrow; CR: Negative serum and urine on immunofixation, disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas and ≤5% plasma cells in bone marrow; VGPR: Serum and urine M-protein detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis or ≥90% reduction in serum M-protein and urine M-protein level \<100 mg/24 hours; PR: ≥50% reduction of serum M-Protein and reduction in urinary M-protein by ≥90% or to \<200 mg/24 hours. A ≥50% decrease in the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels in place of the M-protein criteria or a ≥50% reduction in plasma cells in place of M-protein if baseline was ≥30%. If present at baseline a ≥50% reduction in size of soft tissue plasmacytomas., From randomization through the study follow-up phase; up to the data cut-off of 31 July 2014; Maximum time on follow-up was 141.1 weeks.
Percentage of Participants With Objective Response According to European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) Criteria Based on Investigator Assessment, Objective response defined as a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on the CR and requires all of the following:

* Absence of original monoclonal paraprotein in serum and urine by immunofixation maintained at least 42 days.
* \<5% plasma cell in bone marrow aspirate and on bone marrow biopsy, if performed.
* No increase in size or number of lytic bone lesions.
* Disappearance of soft tissue plasmacytomas.

PR requires all of the following:

* ≥50% reduction in level of serum monoclonal paraprotein, maintained at least 42 days.
* Reduction in 24-hour urinary light chain extraction by ≥90% or to \<200 mg, maintained at least 42 days.
* For patients with non-secretory myeloma, ≥50% reduction in plasma cells in bone marrow aspirate and on biopsy, if performed, for at least 42 days., From randomization through the study follow-up phase; up to the data cut-off of 31 July 2014; Maximum time on follow-up was 141.1 weeks.|Number of Participants With Adverse Events and Type of Adverse Events, An adverse event is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen in a participant during the course of a study. A serious AE is any AE occurring at any dose that:

* Results in death;
* Is life-threatening;
* Requires or prolongs existing inpatient hospitalization;
* Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;
* Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect;
* Constitutes an important medical event.

The Investigator assessed the relationship of each AE to study drug and graded the severity according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, Version 4.0):

Grade 1 = Mild (no limitation in activity or intervention required); Grade 2 = Moderate (some limitation in activity; no/minimal medical intervention required);-Grade 3 = Severe (marked limitation in activity; medical intervention required, hospitalization possible); Grade 4 = Life-threatening; Grade 5 = Death, From first dose of study drug through to 30 days after the last dose, until the data cut-off date of 31 July 2014. Maximum time on treatment was 94.1 weeks.|Kaplan Meier Estimates for Progression Free Survival (PFS) by Investigator Based on IMWG, Progression-free survival was calculated as the time from randomization to disease progression as determined by the Investigator based on the International Myeloma Working Group Uniform Response criteria (IMWG), or death on study, whichever occurred earlier.

Progressive disease requires 1 of the following:

* Increase of ≥ 25% from nadir in:

  * Serum M-component (absolute increase ≥ 0.5 g/dl)
  * Urine M-component (absolute increase ≥ 200 mg/24 hours)
  * In patients without measurable serum and urine M-protein levels the difference between involved and uninvolved free light chain (FLC) levels (absolute increase \> 100 mg/dl)
  * Bone marrow plasma cell percentage (absolute % ≥ 10%)
* Development of new or increase in the size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas., From randomization through the follow-up phase; Maximum duration of follow-up for PFS was 90.3 weeks.|Kaplan-Meier Estimate for Time to Progression (TTP) Based on Investigator Assessment Using IMWG Criteria, Time to progression (TTP) was calculated as the time from randomization to the first documented progression confirmed by the investigator and based on the International Myeloma Working Group Uniform Response criteria (IMWG).

Progressive disease requires 1 of the following:

* Increase of ≥ 25% from nadir in:

  * Serum M-component (absolute increase ≥ 0.5 g/dl)
  * Urine M-component (absolute increase ≥ 200 mg/24 hours)
  * In patients without measurable serum and urine M-protein levels the difference between involved and uninvolved free light chain (FLC) levels (absolute increase \> 100 mg/dl)
  * Bone marrow plasma cell percentage (absolute % ≥ 10%)
* Development of new or increase in the size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas.
* Development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium \> 11.5 mg/dl) attributed solely to plasma cell proliferative disease., From randomization through the follow-up phase; up to the data-cut off of 31 July 2014; Maximum time to progression follow-up was 90.3 weeks.|Kaplan-Meier Estimate Duration of Response Based on Investigator Assessment Using IMWG Criteria, Duration of Response (calculated for responders only) is defined as the time from the initial documented response (partial response or better) to confirmed disease progression by the investigator based on IMWG criteria., From randomization through the study follow-up phase; up to the data cut-off of 31 July 2014; Maximum duration of response follow-up was 90.3 weeks.|Kaplan-Meier Estimate for Overall Survival, Overall survival was calculated as the time from randomization to death from any cause. Overall survival was censored at the last date that the participant was known to be alive for participants who were alive at the time of analysis and for participants who were lost to follow-up before death was documented., From randomization through the follow-up phase; Maximum time on follow-up was 141.1 weeks.|Time to Response Based on IMWG and Assessed by the Investigator, Time to Response was calculated as the time from enrollment to the initial response (PR or better) based on IMWG and assessed by the investigator., From randomization through the follow-up phase; up to the data-cut off of 31 July 2014; Maximum time to response was 23.1 weeks
