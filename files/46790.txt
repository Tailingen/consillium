S1702 Isatuximab in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Primary Amyloidosis
This phase II trial studies how well isatuximab works in treating patients with primary amyloidosis that has come back or does not respond to treatment. Monoclonal antibodies, such as isatuximab, may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread.

Assess Efficacy by Confirmed Overall Hematologic Response, To assess the efficacy as measured by the confirmed overall hematologic response rate (partial response, very good partial response, complete response) of isatuximab in relapsed/ refractory systemic light chain (AL) amyloidosis. Measured as rate of partial response or better.

Partial response is defined as a dFLC decrease of ≥ 50%, but remaining \> 4.0 mg/dL.

Very good partial response is defined as the difference between involved and uninvolved FLCs \[dFLC\] \< 4.0 mg/dL.

Complete response is defined as laboratory values within the normal range free light chain (FLC) ratio (0.25 - 1.65) and negative serum and urine immunofixation., From date of enrollment until progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 4 years
To Evaluate Toxicities in the Treatment of Relapsed/Refractory AL Amyloidosis With Isatuximab., Only adverse events that are possibly, probably or definitely related to study drug are reported., From date of enrollment until progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 4 years|Overall Survival (24 Month Estimate), Overall survival is measured from date of registration to date of death due to any cause. Patients last known to be alive are censored at date of last contact. While OS was assessed up to 4 years, 4 year estimates were not reached. We are reporting the 24 month estimate (how many participants reached survival time of at least 24 months)., From date of enrollment up to 2 years|Duration of Response (24 Month Estimate), Duration of response is measure as time between hematologic response and hematologic progression.

Hematologic progression is defined as 50% increase from nadir.

While duration of response was assessed up to 4 years, 4 year estimates were not reached. We are reporting the 24 month estimate (how many participants achieved 24 month duration of response), Up to 2 years|Time to Hematologic Response, To evaluate time to hematologic response. Partial response is defined as a dFLC decrease of ≥ 50%, but remaining \> 4.0 mg/dL.

Very good partial response is defined as the difference between involved and uninvolved FLCs \[dFLC\] \< 4.0 mg/dL.

Complete response is defined as laboratory values within the normal range free light chain (FLC) ratio (0.25 - 1.65) and negative serum and urine immunofixation., From registration to time of confirmed hematologic progression|Progression-free Survival (24 Month Estimate), To evaluate progression-free survival (24 month estimate)

Hematologic progression is defined as 50% increase from nadir, or from baseline (if there was no response) in any ONE OR MORE of the following:

1. Serum M-protein: 50% increase in Serum M protein to a value greater than 0.5 g/dL.
2. Urine M protein: 50% increase in Urine M protein to a value greater than 200 mg/day (a visible peak must be present)
3. Free light chain increase of 50% to a value greater than 10 mg/dL, From registration to time of confirmed hematologic progression
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To assess the efficacy as measured by the confirmed overall hematologic response rate (partial response or better) of isatuximab in relapsed/refractory systemic light chain (AL) amyloidosis.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate toxicities in the treatment of relapsed/refractory AL amyloidosis with isatuximab.

II. To evaluate time to hematologic response. III. To evaluate duration of response. IV. To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS). V. To evaluate overall survival (OS).

TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate efficacy of isatuximab in relapsed/refractory immunoglobulin amyloid light chain (AL) amyloidosis as measured by organ specific response rates (cardiac, renal, gastrointestinal \[GI\], liver, soft tissue, nerve), in the subset of patients that can be evaluated for organ response.

II. To evaluate time to organ response in the subset of patients that can be evaluated for organ response.

OUTLINE:

Patients receive isatuximab intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of course 1 and on days 1 and 15 of subsequent courses. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 24 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 30 days and then every at least every 6 months for up to 4 years.
