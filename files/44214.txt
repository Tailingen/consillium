Hybrid PET/MR in the Therapy of Cervical Cancer
This is a two arm, single center feasibility study of 20 patients with non-metastatic cervical cancer managed with surgery and/or chemoradiation therapy at UNC Hospitals. Subjects will undergo PET/MRI scans before, during (chemoradiation group only), and after treatment.
Cervix Carcinoma|Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma|Cervical Adenosquamous Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: FDG PET/MR
Proportion of patients who successfully complete PET/MR scans at all study time-points, 2-3 months post-treatment
Sensitivity of PET/MR for baseline disease assessment, Estimated proportion of subjects with disease (positive pathology or PET/CT) that have positive PET/MR scans., pre-treatment|Specificity of hybrid PET/MR for baseline disease assessment, Proportion of subjects without disease (negative pathology or PET/CT) that have negative PET/MR scans., pre-treatment|Accuracy of hybrid PET/MR for baseline disease assessment, Proportion of correct assessments among total population, pre-treatment|Detection of disease with PET/MR at each time point, pre-treatment to 2-3 months post-treatment
The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of obtaining complete and interpretable hybrid PET/MR images for patients diagnosed with cervical cancer.
