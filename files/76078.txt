Lateral Neck Lymph Node Mapping in Thyroid Cancer
This study includes papillary thyroid cancer patients who have unpalpable lateral neck lymph nodes but suspicious on ultrasound and/or CT. Carbon nanoparticles is used as the tracer for lateral neck lymph node mapping.
Thyroid Cancer
PROCEDURE: Lateral neck sentinel lymph node biopsy|PROCEDURE: Modified lateral neck lymph node dissection|PROCEDURE: Super selective lateral neck lymph node dissection
Lymph node counts, Dyed versus undyed lymph node counts in lateral neck compartments, 1 month after surgery
Lymph node metastasis rate, The rate of lymph node metastasis in lateral neck compartments, 1 month after surgery
