A Study to Evaluate Rivoceranib Plus Best Supportive Care Compared to Placebo Plus Best Supportive Care in Participants With Gastric Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rivoceranib plus best supportive care (BSC) compared to placebo plus BSC in participants with advanced or metastatic gastric cancer (GC).
Gastric Cancer|Gastric Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: Rivoceranib|DRUG: Placebo
Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from randomization to death. Participants alive or lost to follow-up at the end of study (EOS) were censored., Day 1 (randomization) up to approximately 36 months
Progression-free Survival (PFS) Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), PFS was defined as the time from randomization to either documented radiological progression or death from any cause. Participants alive and free of progression at the EOS were censored., Up to approximately 24 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR) Per RECIST 1.1, ORR was defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population with the best overall response of Complete Response (CR: disappearance of all target lesions and reduction in short axis of any nodal target lesions to \<10 millimeter \[mm\]) or a Partial Response (PR: â‰¥30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of the target lesions, taking as a reference the baseline sum diameters) per RECIST 1.1., Up to approximately 24 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR was defined as the proportion of participants with a Best Overall Response of CR, PR, or stable disease (SD: Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as a reference the smallest sum diameter while on study) per RECIST 1.1., Up to approximately 24 months|Change From Baseline in Global Health Status/Quality of Life (QoL) Measured by European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), EORTC QLQ-C30 is a cancer specific Questionnaire with 30 questions for assessing the health-related QOL of cancer participants. The questionnaire incorporates 5 functional scales, 4 symptom scales, a global QOL scale, and single items for the assessment of additional systems commonly reported by cancer participants. All items are scored on 4-point Likert scales, ranging from 1 ('not at all') to 4 ('very much'), with the exception of 2 items in the global QOL scale which use modified 7-point linear analog scales. A linear transformation was used to standardize all scores and single-items to a scale of 0 to 100. For the functioning scales, a higher score indicated greater functioning and for the symptom scales, a higher score indicated a greater symptom burden., Baseline, End of Treatment (EOT) (Up to 24 months)|Change From Baseline in European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Stomach Cancer Specific (EORTC QLQ-STO22) Score, EORTC QLQ-STO22 is a 22-item gastric cancer-specific questionnaire-integrating system for assessing the health-related QOL of gastric cancer participants. Most questions use 4-point scale (1 'Not at all' to 4 'Very much'; 1 question was a yes or no answer). A linear transformation was used to standardize all scores and single-items to a scale of 0 to 100. For the functioning scales, a higher score indicates greater functioning and for the symptom scales, a higher score indicates a greater symptom burden., Baseline, EOT (Up to 24 months)|Change From Baseline in EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-Level Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-5D-5L VAS) Score, EQ-5D-5L Questionnaire consists of EQ-5D-5L descriptive system and the visual analogue scale (VAS). The descriptive system comprises the 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) and each dimension has 5 levels. The VAS is designed to rate the participant's current health state on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst imaginable health state and 100 represents the best imaginable health state., Baseline, EOT (Up to 24 months)|Number of Participants Per QOL Dimension Response as Measured by the EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L) Questionnaire, EQ-5D-5L Questionnaire comprises the 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) and each dimension has 5 levels of response., EOT (Month 24)
