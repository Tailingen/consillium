Prognostic and Predictive Impact of uPA/PAI-1
Chemo-N0 (1993-1998) is the first prospective randomized multicenter trial in N0 BC designed to prospectively evaluate the clinical utility of a biomarker. It used uPA/PAI 1 as stratification criteria and randomized high-risk patients to chemotherapy versus observation; low-risk patients remained without any systemic therapy. The trial was designed to answer two principle questions:

1. Can the reported prognostic impact of uPA and PAI 1 be validated in a prospective multicenter therapy trial? Does low uPA/PAI 1 identify those low-risk N0 patients who are candidates for being spared necessity and burden of adjuvant chemotherapy?
2. Do uPA/PAI 1 high-risk patients benefit from adjuvant CMF chemotherapy?

Prognostic impact of uPA/PAI-1: Number of patients disease-free in low vs. high risk groups according to uPA/PAI-1, Interim analyses planned at 4.5, 6.5, and 8.5 years after first patient in. Final analysis scheduled at 10.5 years after last patient in., DFS at 3, 5, and 10 years (depending on analysis time point)|The benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy in high-risk group according to uPA/PAI-1: Number of patients disease-free vs. those relapsed at the given time points, Interim analyses planned at 4.5, 6.5, and 8.5 years after first patient in. Final analysis scheduled at 10.5 years after last patient in., DFS at 3, 5, and 10 years (depending on analysis time point)
Overall survival, Interim analyses planned at 4.5, 6.5, and 8.5 years after first patient in. Final analysis scheduled at 10.5 years after last patient in., at 3, 5, and 10 years (depending on analysis time point).
