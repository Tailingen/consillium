Analysis of Clinical Characteristics and Study of Diagnostic Markers in Patients with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
The investigators collected clinical data and serum samples of patients with polycystic ovary syndrome in this study, used statistical software such as SPSS for data analysis, and used experimental techniques such as ELISA to detect serum samples, aiming to explore the relationship between the body anthropometry, glucose and lipid metabolism, gonadal hormones and body fat distribution in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome and to discovery new biomarkers and promote the realization of more accurate personalized medicine.

diagnostic markers of PCOS patients, Fibrinogen-like-protein 1 (FGL1), is a novel hepatokine that plays an important role in hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance and obesity. There is no maximum or minimum value for this parameter and the higher scores mean a worse outcome., baseline
