Phase II Clinical Study of Camrelizumab Combined With Chemotherapy or Anlotinib in Advanced Esophageal Squamous Cell Cancer
To observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of camrelizumab combined with chemotherapy or anlotinib in patients with advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma previously Treated With First-line Immunotherapy
Stage IV Esophagus Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Camrelizumab|DRUG: Irinotecan|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Paclitaxel-albumin|DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Anlotinib
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who have a Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: â‰¥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1, Up to 24 month
Duration of response (DoR), DOR is defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 24 month|Disease control rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who have a CR, PR or stable disease (SD) per RECIST 1.1., Up to 24 month|Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival is defined as the duration from date of enrollment to the first occurrence of progression of disease or death from any cause, Up to 24 month|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the duration from date of enrollment to the date of death from any cause., Up to 24 month
How to improve the efficacy of immunotherapy, evaluate the results of immunotherapy more objectively, and overcome immune resistance through reasonable combined treatment methods, so as to maximize the benefit of patients from immunotherapy, is an urgent research direction to be explored. Therefore, this study intends to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of camrelizumab combined with chemotherapy or anlotinib in patients with advanced esophageal squamous cell cancer previously Treated With First-line Immunotherapy . It can provide a basis for the treatment of esophageal cancer after immune resistance.
