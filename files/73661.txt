Venetoclax After TKI to Target Persisting Stem Cells in CML
There is currently no available treatment, capable to increase the rate of sustained deep molecular remissions after TKI discontinuation in CML. Venetoclax could be such a drug. The study will provide unprecedented biological insights on the effects of venetoclax in controlling minimal residual stem cell disease induced by long-term prior TKI therapy. If the study would be positive, the findings could become practice changing for patients in deep molecular remission under TKI and willing to tolerate a temporary additional treatment.
