Intraoperative MRI and 5-ALA Guidance to Improve the Extent of Resection in Brain Tumor Surgery
The investigators hypothesize that the rate of radiologically complete resections of contrast-enhancing brain tumors following surgeries aided by use of 5-ALA induced fluorescence guidance and use of an intraoperative ultra-low field MRI is higher compared to surgeries aided by 5-ALA induced fluorescene alone.
Primary Malignant Neoplasm of Nervous System|Glioma|Glioblastoma|Metastasis
PROCEDURE: Interventional arm|PROCEDURE: Control arm
Extent of Resection, The primary efficacy endpoint is the rate of complete resections according to early postoperative MRI., Early postoperative MRI within 72 hrs
Volumetric extent of resection, Secondary endpoint is the volumetric extent of resection as determined by direct comparison of preoperative and early postoperative tumor volumes., Early postoperative MRI within 72hrs|PFS 6, Secondary endpoint is the rate of subjects with progression-free survival (PFS) 6 months after tumor resection, 6 months following surgery|PFS 12, Secondary endpoint is the rate of subjects with progression-free survival (PFS) 12 months after tumor resection, 12 months following surgery|Quality of life, Patient quality of life at 6 and 12 months following surgery is a secondary endpoint, 6 months/12 months
NIHSS, The change of NIHSS (The NIH Stroke Scale) score is an other pre-specified outcome measure, 5 days following surgery
The investigators hypothesize that the rate of radiologically complete resections of contrast-enhancing brain tumors following surgeries aided by use of 5-ALA induced fluorescence guidance and use of an intraoperative ultra-low field MRI is higher compared to surgeries aided by 5-ALA induced fluorescene alone.
