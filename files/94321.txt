Telatinib in Combination With Capecitabine/ Oxaliplatin in 1st Line Gastric or GEJ Cancer
The purpose of the trial is to compare the combination regimen of Telatinib and Capecitabine and Oxaliplatin vs. Capecitabine and Oxaplatin to explore superiority of the Telatinib combination in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) in patients previously untreated for advanced HER2 negative advanced gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction adenocarcinoma.

ORR, the proportion of patients with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) among all patients assessed per RESIST v1.1., 24 months
PFS, Progression free survival of All the Evaluable Participants.Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, in addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression)., 24 months|CBR, Clinical Benefit Rate, defined as CR+PR+SDâ‰¥ 24 weeks, 24 months|DCR, the proportion of patients who had a best response rating of complete response, partial response, or stable disease, 24 months
This trial is a Phase 2, prospective, double-blind, randomized, comparative, multicenter trial in patients with advanced HER2 negative adenocarcinoma of the stomach or Gastroesophageal Junction which has progressed after resection and adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy, or is unresectable or metastatic at time of first diagnosis. a total of approximately 90 patients will be enrolled and randomized into Telatinib combined with Capecitabine and Oxaliplatin or chemotherapy combined with placebo. All patients will be treated until progressive disease (radiologically documented or symptomatic deterioration) or the occurrence of unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or investigator's judgment.
