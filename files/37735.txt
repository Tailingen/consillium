A Multi-center Open-label Phase 2 Study of Ixazomib, Iberdomide and Dexamethasone in Elderly Patients With Multiple Myeloma at First Relapse."
This is a phase II, multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the rate of patients achieving very good partial response (VGPR) or better to the oral combination Iberdomide Ixazomib Dexamethasone in elderly patients with multiple myeloma at first relapse .

The patient population will consist of adult men and women more than 70 years, who meet eligibility criteria.

Following the screening period, patients will be enrolled and treated then, they will receive therapy with Iberdomide, Ixazomib and Dexaméthasone during 6 cycles and Iberdomide and Ixazomib until progression.
