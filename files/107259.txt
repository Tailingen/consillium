Study of Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) in Triple Negative Breast Cancer Survivors
This randomized phase II trial studies how well docosahexaenoic acid works in preventing recurrence in breast cancer survivors. Docosahexaenoic acid supplement may prevent recurrence in breast cancer survivors.

DRUG: Docosahexaenoic Acid|OTHER: Placebo
Normal Breast Tissue Expression of Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha (TNF-alpha) Levels, Differences in normal breast tissue levels of TNF-α 12 weeks post-treatment relative to pre-treatment for active treatment and placebo arm, compared using analysis of covariance where the post-treatment measurements were used as a dependent variable and the pretreatment measurements were included as a covariate in the analysis. For the primary study end-point TNF-α levels will be measured by quantitative real-time PCR (mRNA essays) on extracted RNA from breast core biopsies. Relative expression determined using the Computed Tomography (ΔΔCT) analysis protocol., Baseline to 12 weeks
Number of Participants With Crown-like Structures of the Breast (CLS-B) at Baseline and Post-treatment, An indicator of whether a subject is detected with CLS-B or not., Baseline to 12 weeks|Absolute Change in CLS-B/cm^2 Adjusted for the Pre-treatment Measurements, To assess the severity of CLS-B using the following formula: number of CLS-B/cm\^2. The absolute change in the CLS-B/cm\^2 calculated according to the formula; Change in CLS-B/cm\^2 = (post-treatment CLS-B/cm\^2) - (pre-treatment CLS-B/cm\^2)., Baseline to 12 weeks|Breast Tissue Cox 2 mRNA Levels at Baseline and 12 Weeks, Biomarkers COX-2 are measured by quantitative real-time PCR. Differences between active treatment and placebo arm for each biomarker will be compared using analysis of covariance where the post treatment measurements will be used as a dependent variable and the pretreatment measurements will be included as a covariate in the analysis., Baseline to 12 weeks|Mean Difference in the Breast Tissue IL- Beta mRNA Levels of Tissue Biomarkers, Biomarkers IL-1Beta are measured by quantitative real-time PCR. Differences between active treatment and placebo arm for each biomarker will be compared using analysis of covariance where the post treatment measurements will be used as a dependent variable and the pretreatment measurements will be included as a covariate in the analysis., Baseline to 12 weeks|Mean Difference in the Breast Tissue Aromatase mRNA Levels of Tissue Biomarkers, Biomarkers Aromatase are measured by quantitative real-time PCR. Differences between active treatment and placebo arm for each biomarker will be compared using analysis of covariance where the post treatment measurements will be used as a dependent variable and the pretreatment measurements will be included as a covariate in the analysis., Baseline and 12 weeks|Red Blood Cell (RBC) Fatty Acid Level as a Surrogate of Compliance, Whole blood samples collected for red blood cell fatty acid analyses at baseline and week 12 (+ 2 weeks). RBC fatty acid composition analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) with flame ionization detection., Baseline and week 12
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine whether treatment with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) for 12 weeks at 1000 mg twice daily as compared to placebo reduces normal breast tissue levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in overweight and obese patients with a history of stage I-III invasive breast cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), Paget's disease, lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS), or proliferative benign breast disease.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To investigate the effect of DHA at 1000 mg twice daily on tissue biomarkers

* Change from the baseline in cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)/interleukin-1-beta (IL-1beta)/aromatase measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
* Change from the baseline in crown-like structures of the breast (CLS-B) measured by immunohistochemical techniques for cluster of differentiation (CD)68.
* Change from baseline in CLS-B index determined as follows: (\[number of slides with evidence of at least one CLS-B\]/\[total number of slides examined\]).
* Change from baseline in CLS-B/cm\^2 defined as the number of CLS-B/cm\^2. II. Evaluate age as a predictor of CLS-B and inflammatory biomarkers (TNF-alpha/COX-2/IL-1beta) at baseline and over the time of treatment.

III. Evaluate red blood cell (RBC) fatty acid level as a surrogate of compliance.

OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

ARM I: Patients receive docosahexaenoic acid orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 12 weeks.

ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO BID for 12 weeks.
