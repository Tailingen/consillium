Bryostatin 1 in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Refractory Hodgkin's Disease
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of bryostatin 1 in treating patients who have recurrent or refractory Hodgkin's disease.
Lymphoma
DRUG: bryostatin 1
OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate in patients with recurrent or refractory Hodgkin's disease treated with bryostatin 1. II. Determine qualitative and quantitative toxicities of bryostatin 1 in these patients. III. Determine duration of response and survival in these patients.

OUTLINE: Patients receive bryostatin 1 by continuous IV infusion over 72 hours. Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity for at least 4 courses. Patients who achieve complete response (CR) are treated with 4 additional courses beyond CR.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-27 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
