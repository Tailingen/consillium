the Value of Immunohistochemical Expression of Moesin in Endometrial Hyperplasia and Endometrial Carcinoma
Endometrial carcinoma (EC) is the most prevalent invasive carcinoma of the female genital tract in developed countries, while it ranks as the second most frequently occurring neoplasm of women in developing countries, after carcinoma of the cervix uteri. The vast majority of ECs occur in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women .

ECs are classified into two distinct phenotypes; type I which represents more than 80% of all cases of ECs, it has a favorable prognosis. This type is linked to excess, unopposed hyper-estrogenic condition and it is almost always preceded by endometrial hyperplasia. On the contrary, type II endometrial carcinoma is less common than type I, representing less than 10% of all cases of ECs. Type II endometrial carcinomas are high grade, poorly differentiated and estrogen-independent tumors .
Endometrial Cancer and Endometrial Hyperplasia
DEVICE: microscopic pathological evaluation
The value of immunohistochemical expression of moesin in endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial carcinoma, To evaluate immunohistochemical expression of moesin in normal, hyperplasic and neoplastic endometrial tissues , correlate this expression with different clinicopathologic parameters of endometrial carcinoma and to evaluate the role of moesin as prognostic marker in progression from preinvasive lesions of the endometrium to endometrial carcinoma., 1 year
