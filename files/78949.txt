A Study to Investigate Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Preliminary Efficacy With GenSci122 in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a first-in-human (FIH), multicenter, open-label, phase I study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK and preliminary efficacy of GenSci122 in participants with advanced solid tumors. The study consists of 2 parts: Part 1- dose-escalation and Part 2- dose expansion. The primary endpoint of Dose escalation is To assess the safety and tolerability of GenSci122. The primary endpoint of Dose expansion is to evaluate the preliminary anti-tumor activity of GenSci122 in participants with advanced solid tumors.
