A Phase II Multi-Strata Study of PM01183 as a Single Agent or in Combination With Conventional Chemotherapy in Metastatic and/or Unresectable Sarcomas
This research study is investigating a drug called PM01183 alone and in combination with chemotherapy drugs called gemcitabine or doxorubicin as a possible treatment for metastatic or unresectable Sarcoma.
Metastatic Sarcoma
DRUG: PM01183|DRUG: Doxorubicin|DRUG: Gemcitabine
Disease Control Rate, The number of participants that achieved either Stable Disease (SD) or a Partial Response (PR) as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) at 24 weeks.

* Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.
* Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study., 24 Weeks
Overall Response Rate, The overall response rate is the number of participants that achieved either Stable Disease (SD), a Partial Response (PR), or a Complete Response (CR) as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1). The overall response rate is the best response recorded from the start of treatment until disease progression/recurrence.

* Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm.
* Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.
* Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study., Every 6 weeks for the first 8 cycles (cycle is 21 days) and then every 9 weeks thereafter until disease progression|Treatment Related Serious Adverse Events, Summary of the serious adverse events (SAE) experienced by participants that were deemed to be at least possibly related to PM01183 when administered alone or with Doxorubicin or Gemcitabine. Adverse events were assessed using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4)., From the start of treatment until 30 days after the end of treatment
This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the intervention is being studied.

PM01183 is a new drug that is believed to bind DNA cause double strands of DNA to break. This drug has been studied in previous research studies, and these suggest that it may slow or stop the growth of cancers. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved PM01183 as a treatment for any disease.

In this research study, the investigators are trying to assess the effects, good or bad, that PM01183, administered either alone or in combination with gemcitabine or doxorubicin has on metastatic or unresectable sarcoma.
