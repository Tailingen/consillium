3D Laparoscopic Adrenalectomies for Adrenal Tumors
The main drawbacks of conventional 2D laparoscopy are limited depth perception and loss of spatial orientation. High-quality 3D laparoscopy systems might improve surgical outcomes for adrenalectomy.
Adrenal Tumor|Adrenalectomy; Status
Postoperative complications rate of 3D laparoscopic adrenalectomy, Rate of medical and surgical complications within 30 days after surgery using the Dindo-Clavien classification, described as:

Grade I = Any deviation from the normal postoperative course. Grade 2 = Requiring pharmacological treatment with drugs other than such allowed for grade I complications.

Grade III = Requiring surgical, endoscopic or radiological intervention, not under (Grade IIIa) or under general anesthesia (Grade IIIb) Grade IV = Life-threatening complication with single organ (Grade IVa) or Multiorgan dysfunction (Grade IVb) Grade V = Death of a patient., Within 30 days after surgery|Length of hospital stay, Total length of hospital stay will be recorded in days beginning at admission for surgery until discharge (number of days) ., Up to 4 weeks

Over recent decades, technological advances such as improved video imaging (high-definition cameras), better instrumentation for dissection and hemostasis, articulating staplers, and optimized operating room lighting have added safety, efficacy, and precision to minimally invasive procedures. However, until recently, laparoscopy required surgeons to operate in a three-dimensional (3D) space with only two-dimensional (2D) images to guide their movements, resulting in a lack of depth perception and loss of spatial orientation that increased the risk of errors, fatigue, operative time, and operating room stress and made the technique difficult to learn.

High-quality 3D laparoscopy was developed as an alternative to conventional 2D laparoscopy. Several clinical trials and observational studies have compared surgical outcomes between 2D and 3D laparoscopic systems; however, few clinical studies have examined the usefulness of 3D laparoscopy systems for adrenalectomies.
