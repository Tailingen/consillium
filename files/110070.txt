How do I Perform a Laparoscopic Removal of a Pelvic Retroperitoneal Schwannoma
Schwannomas are mainly benign tumors, which develop mainly in the skull or in the cervical region. Retroperitoneal location is rare, since it represents between 0.5 and 5% of scwhanomas. The malignant retroperitoneal form is, however, more common than in other locations.

Retroperitoneal schwannoma is often discovered during the exploration of unexplained lumbo-pelvic pain, or in the face of compression of nearby organs. Abdominopelvic CT and magnetic resonance imaging are essential to characterize the mass and verify its extension. The precise diagnosis is based on the pathological examination of the part, and complete surgical excision is the standard treatment.

Acquiring the surgical techniques and skills necessary to carry out these types of procedures is essential to providing optimal patient care.
