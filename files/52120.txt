Evaluation And Risk Assessment For Persistent Postsurgical Pain After Breast Surgery
Pre-existing pain and severe postoperative pain are predictors of persistent pain after surgery, but a complete understanding on the development of persistent pain is still lacking. The study aims to identify clinically relevant and genetic risk factors for persistent postsurgical pain that can be reliably distinguished statistically.

Persistent pain at 4 months after surgery, Persistent pain is defined as having one of the below criteria at 4 months after surgery:

i) having pain score at rest (Numeric Rating Scale 0 to 100) of 30 or more; or ii) having pain score on movement (Numeric Rating Scale 0 to 100) of 30 or more; or iii) or "yes" to one of the seven questions on the presence of pain in daily life activities (mood, walking, carrying heavy loads, work, relations with people, sleep, enjoyment of life), 4 months after surgery
Persistent pain at 6 months after surgery, Persistent pain is defined as having one of the below criteria at 4 months after surgery:

i) having pain score at rest (Numeric Rating Scale 0 to 100) of 30 or more; or ii) having pain score on movement (Numeric Rating Scale 0 to 100) of 30 or more; or iii) or "yes" to one of the seven questions on the presence of pain in daily life activities (mood, walking, carrying heavy loads, work, relations with people, sleep, enjoyment of life), 6 months after surgery|Maximum Acute post-operative pain score, The maximum number of patient-reported post-operative pain score (Numeric Rating Scale 0 to 100) at 0 - 72 hours, Up to 3 days after surgery|Opioid consumption, The total opioid consumption (morphine/ fentanyl/ hydromorphone/ oxycodone/ hydrocodone etc) throughout the 72 hours. The opioid consumption will be converted using oral morphine equivalent (OME) conversion calculations., Up to 3 days after surgery
The study will focus on: (i) risk factors representing biopsychosocial processes that influence chronic pain, such as pain and psychological vulnerability; (ii) genetic factors relating to mechanistic pathways to persistent pain generation. Patients will be recruited from those undergoing breast cancer surgery at the mentioned site. Pain and anxiety assessment will be conducted via visual analogue scoring, mechanical temporal summation assessment and a series of questionnaires. After the surgery, all patients will be given appropriate analgesia, and the pain score and analgesia usage will be recorded. Phone survey will be conducted 4 and 6 months, respectively, after surgery to determine the outcomes.
