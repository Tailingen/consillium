A Phase 1/2 Study of BPI-361175 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a phase I/II, open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor activity of BPI-361175 tablets in patients with advanced solid tumors including advanced Non-small cell Lung cancer (NSCLC).This is a three-stage study, consisting of Phase Ia dose escalation, Phase Ib dose expansion and pivotal Phase II Study. The pivotal Phase II study will be designed based on data generated from the Phase I studies.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: BPI-361175
Phase I: The adverse events (AEs), Safety and tolerability will be assessed by monitoring frequency, duration and severity of adverse events (AEs)., Through the Phase I, approximately 24 months|Phase I: Determine the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D), Number of subjects with dose limiting toxicity, Through the Phase I, approximately 24 months|Phase II: the objective response rate (ORR), The proportion of patients with complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) in all patients., Through the Phase II, approximately 24 months
Phase I: Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of BPI-361175, Blood plasma concentration, Through the Phase I, approximately 24 months|Phase I: the objective response rate (ORR), The proportion of patients with complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) in all patients., Through the Phase I, approximately 24 months|Phase II: Disease control rate (DCR), The proportion of patients with CR, PR and stable disease (SD) in all patients., Through the Phase II, approximately 24 months|Phase II: Progression free survival (PFS), The time from the first study dose to disease progression (PD) or death, whichever occurs first., Through the Phase II, approximately 24 months|Phase II: Overall survival (OS), The time from the first study dose to death due to any cause., Through the Phase II, approximately 24 months|Phase II: Duration of response (DOR), The time from the first CR or PR to the first PD or death due to any cause., Through the Phase II, approximately 24 months|Phase II: The adverse events (AEs), Safety and tolerability will be assessed by monitoring frequency, duration and severity of adverse events (AEs)., Through the Phase II, approximately 24 months|Phase I: Disease control rate (DCR), The proportion of patients with CR, PR and stable disease (SD) in all patients., Through the Phase I, approximately 24 months|Phase I: Progression free survival (PFS), The time from the first study dose to disease progression (PD) or death, whichever occurs first., Through the Phase I, approximately 24 months|Phase I: Overall survival (OS), The time from the first study dose to death due to any cause., Through the Phase I, approximately 24 months
