TY-9591 in the Patients With EGFR Mutations in Advanced NSCLC With Brain Metastases
This study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TY-9591 in first-line treatment of patients with EGFR-sensitive mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer with brain metastases compared to Osimertinib.

This is an open label, multi-center phase II study to compare the efficacy and safety with Osimertinib in EGFR mutated NSCLC patients with brain metastases. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the TY-9591 group (160mg orally, once daily) or Osimertinb group (80mg orally, once daily) . Participants can continue to receive study treatment as long as disease progression, meeting criteria for discontinuation of treatment, withdrawal criteria, or study termination (whichever occurred first).
