Contribution of PET/MRI in Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer (ATICC)
\[18 F\]fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography-magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) is a new hybrid imaging tool that has recently arrived in oncology, and is particularly promising. Its usefulness seems obvious in certain tumor types, but its place in the staging of cervical cancers has never been explored in a prospective trial to our knowledge.

Previously, a comparative retrospective study from 2009 found a better sensitivity of PET fused to diagnostic MRI images compared to PET/CT (positron emission tomography/computed tomography) in the detection of metastatic lymph nodes (54 and 44% respectively). It was an a posteriori fusion of images, from images acquired by PET-CT.

Compare performances of PET/MRI and PET/CT in the detection of lymph node metastases in cervical cancer patients with tumors graded IB2 to IVA stage, outside of lumbar aortic region, Performances in terms of sensitivity, Up to 3 months|Compare performances PET/MRI and para-aortic lymphadenectomy in the detection of lumbar aortic lymph node metastases in cervical cancer patients, Lumbar/aortic lymph nodes detection with each exams, Up to 3 months
This monocentric, prospective trial aims at comparing performances of 18F-FDG PET/MRI versus standard PET/CT in the detection of lymph node metastases in cervical cancer patients. Specificity and sensitivity of both exams will be compared at one timepoint, during the PET/CT prescribed in routine care for assessment of extension. PET/MRI will be conducted directly after PET/CT and a unique dose of 18F-FDG radiotracer will be used for both exams.
