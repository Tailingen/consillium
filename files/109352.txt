A China Bridging Study of Ivosidenib in r/r AML Subjects With an IDH1 Mutation
This is a phase 1, multi-center, single-arm study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics(PK)/ pharmacodynamics(PD), safety, and clinical efficacy of orally administered Ivosidenib in Chinese subjects with R/R AML with an IDH1 mutation.
