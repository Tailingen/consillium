A Study of Avutometinib (VS-6766) + Defactinib (VS-6063) in Recurrent Low-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer
This study will assess the safety and efficacy of avutometinib (VS-6766) in combination with defactinib versus Investigator's choice of treatments (ICT) in subjects with recurrent LGSOC who have progressed on a prior platinum-based therapy.

This international, randomized, open-label, Phase 3 study will compare the investigational combination of avutometinib plus defactinib versus Investigator's Choice of Treatments (ICT) in patients with recurrent LGSOC who have progressed on a prior platinum-based therapy. Avutometinib and defactinib are both types of drugs called kinase inhibitors. Kinase inhibitors block cancer cell growth. The study will compare the progression-free survival (PFS) of the combination of avutometinib plus defactinib versus ICT. The study will also evaluate the effect of the combination on safety, overall survival, other efficacy endpoints, and health-related quality of life and disease related symptoms. The study is being conducted by gynecological cancer specialists. Patients who are eligible and agree to participate in this study will be treated with either a combination of avutometinib with defactinib, or with one of four standard of care NCCN and ESMO treatment recommendations for recurrent LGSOC, and then with subsequent follow up appointments. Patients who originally received one of the standards of care treatments who are determined to have progressive disease may be eligible to crossover to receive the investigational combination avutometinib plus defactinib.Avutometinib and defactinib are investigational drugs that have not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
