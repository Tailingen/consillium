PD-1 Knockout Engineered T Cells for Advanced Esophageal Cancer
This study will evaluate the safety of PD-1 knockout engineered T cells in treating advanced esophageal cancer. Blood or tissue samples will also be collected for research purposes.
Esophageal Cancer
OTHER: PD-1 Knockout T Cells
Response Rate, Response will be evaluated according to RECIST v1.1, 1-3 months
Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, Number of participants with Adverse Events and grade as a measure of safety and tolerability of PD-1 knockout T cells using CTCAE v4.03, 6 months
Progression free survival (PFS), From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, 1 year|Overall Survival (OS), The time from randomization to death from any cause, 1 year|Peripheral blood T lymphocyte subsets, Sera were collected at baseline and after the first cycle to measure T lymphocyte subsets with flow cytometry, 6 weeks|Tumor-infiltrating T cells, Baseline and post-treatment tissue samples were tested for the tumor-infiltrating T cells with immunofluorescence., Baseline and after treatment
This is a prospective clinical study of ex-vivo selected, engineered, and expanded PD-1 knockout T cells from autologous origin. 16 advanced esophageal cancer patients are planned to receive two cycles of PD-1 knockout engineered T cells infusion. Immunological markers are analyzed as well.
