Bonds Between Circulating Tumoral ADN (ctDNA) and the Development of Peritoneal Carcinomatosis for Patients Under PIPAC
PIPADN is a pilot monocentric, study with a total duration of 42 months. The purpose of this study is to describe the variation of plasma ctDNA concentration between the 1st and the 3rd PIPAC session in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis.

The improvement of life quality with this type of treatment will also be evaluated though the EORTC QLQ-C30 survey.

Each patient will have three PIPAC sessions spaced 6 to 8 weeks apart. Two blood samples will be taken during the first 3 PIPAC sessions, one the day before each procedure and a second one 24 hours afterwards.

The EORTC QLQ 30 survey will be completed by patients during the pre-operative consultation and at each post-operative consultation (about 3 weeks after PIPAC sessions).
