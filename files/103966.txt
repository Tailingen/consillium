Feasibility Study of Radiation Therapy With Wide Detector 4DCT Scanning for Primary or Metastatic Lung Cancer
Currently there are very few studies using wide-body detectors for 4DCT to determine lung tumor volume and comparing them with conventional detector 4DCT images, and no prospective clinical trials comparing 4DCT images from different width detectors have been queried, therefore, in this study, we will prospectively explore in a body model and patients: 1) the degree of artifacts, tumor volume, and radiation dose of the 4DCT scans performed by different width detectors. differences, and scanning radiation dose. (ii) Whether there are differences in different tumor ITV outlining modalities on 4DCT with different detector widths.
