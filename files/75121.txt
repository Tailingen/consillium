Study of SKB264 for Locally Advanced, Recurrent or Metastatic HR+/HER2- Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SKB264 in patients with unresectable locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic HR+/HER2- breast cancer.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: SKB264|DRUG: Eribulin|DRUG: Capecitabine|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Vinorelbine
Progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by BIRC per RECIST 1.1., PFS, defined as the time from randomization to PD or death, whichever occurs first., up to 24 months
Overall Survival (OS), OS, defined as the time from randomization to death, up to 24 months|Progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by the investigators per RECIST V 1.1, PFS, defined as the time from randomization to PD or death, whichever occurs first., up to 24 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), The percentage of patients with CR and PR assessed by BIRC and investigators per RECIST v 1.1, up to 24 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), The percentage of patients who have achieved CRï¼ŒPR and SD assessed by BIRC and investigators per RECIST v 1.1, up to 24 months|Duration of Response (DoR), From the date that response criteria are first met to the first occurrence of PD as determined by BIRC and investigators per RECIST v1.1 or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, up to 24 months|Quality of life of patients evaluated using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) scale, To assess the impact of SKB264 on disease related symptoms and health related quality of life (HRQoL) in this patient population, Up to 2 years|AEs and SAEs, Incidence and severity of AEs and SAEs (per CTCAE 5.0), and clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings, AEs should be observed and recorded from signing the ICF until 30 days after the last dose. AEs occurring 30 days after the last dose are not required to be actively collected by the investigator.
This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter Phase 3 clinical study to evaluate SKB264 monotherapy versus Treatment of Physician's Choice (TPC) in subjects with unresectable locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic HR+/HER2- breast cancer who had failed at least one line of systemic chemotherapy.
