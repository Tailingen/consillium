Plasma Biomarkers P-DAC, V1
This is an exploratory, translational, non-interventional and multi-centre clinical study. The aim of the study is to identify predictive plasma biomarkers of response to chemotherapy in PDAC.
Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma
Time to disease recurrence, Identify plasma biomarkers that are predictive for response to treatment as defined by time to recurrence, Blood samples analysed up to 2 year follow up, estimated 4 years in total
Rate of progression free survival, To discover plasma biomarkers that are predictive for response to treatment as defined by progression free survival, Blood samples analysed up to 2 year follow up, estimated 4 years in total|Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and concordance index, Aim to validate a panel of predictive plasma biomarkers proving its accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and to investigate their expression at tissue level gaining a further understanding of cancer and/or host related proteins in disease response and progression, For the duration of study, expected 4 years
This study will involve two cohort groups, all patients involved will have PDAC.

Cohort A: Target is 80 resectable PDAC patients who will receive standard treatment of chemotherapy +/- radiotherapy

Cohort B:

* Cohort B1 = Target is 80 unresectable locally advanced PDAC patients who will receive standard treatment of chemotherapy +/- radiotherapy.
* Cohort B2 = Target is metastatic PDAC patients who will receive standard treatment of chemotherapy +/- radiotherapy.

Control patients: Target is 50, with acute pancreatitis admitted to hospital for observation/treatment.

Blood samples will be taken at the following time points:

* prior to resection, whenever feasible for cohort A
* prior to CT, for both cohort A and B
* during CT, for both cohort A and B
* follow-up, approximately every 3 to 6 months for two years for cohort A
