Using PSMA PET-CT as a Diagnostic Tool for Detection of Prostatic Cancer at an Early Stage
The aim of the study is the evaluation of the possible role of PSMA PET-CT in early detection of prostate cancer, reducing rate of unnecessary prostate biopsies, and in cases of prostate cancer, correct staging of the disease and corresponding management.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Prostate Biopsy Test
Prostate Cancer Diagnosis, One investigator will interpret the PSMA PET-CT and another one will interpret MRI, both in a blinded and independent fashion and before the biopsy. At the end of the study, these 'blind' PSMA PET-CT and MRI reports will be compared to each other and to the actual fusion biopsy results. In the event that a high correlation is found between the diagnostic imaging results to those of the fusion biopsies, it would suggest that PSMA PET-CT could give the option to be performed instead of the need for biopsy in men who present with high levels of PSA and prompt treatment accordingly., 2 months

Consequently, use of PSMA PET-CT in patients with suspicious PSA changes may improve our knowledge whether the prostate tumor is clinically significant or not (for the development of PSMA PET-CT with 68 Ga ligand allows to visualize prostate cancer with aggressive patterns), and improve clinical decision making for performing prostate biopsy or selecting patients for observation only.

In light of the above, we are of the opinion that this proposed study has the potential to significantly alter the medical practice of how prostate cancer is diagnosed, which even today suffers from real clinical dilemma.
