Effect of Relacorilant on the Pharmacokinetics of the Sensitive P-glycoprotein Substrate Dabigatran Etexilate in Healthy Participants
The primary objective is to determine the effect of relacorilant on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the sensitive P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate dabigatran etexilate.

The investigational medicinal product (IMP), relacorilant, and the non-investigational medicinal product (NIMP), dabigatran etexilate, will be used to evaluate the effect of relacorilant on the PK of the sensitive P-gp substrate, dabigatran etexilate in healthy participants. Participants will receive a single dose of dabigatran etexilate before and after administration of daily (QD) doses of relacorilant for 11 days. As all participants will receive the same treatments, the study will be open-label and no randomization is required.
