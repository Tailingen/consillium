Trial Evaluating Nilotinib as Treatment for Newly Diagnosed CML Patients in Accelerated Phase.
This is an open label, non randomized, prospective, multicenter, phase II clinical trial evaluating nilotinib 400 mg BID for the treatment of newly diagnosed CML-AP patients.

Patients enrolled into the study will receive 400mg of nilotinib, orally, twice daily (800mg/day)
Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML)
DRUG: AMN107
To evaluate the safety and tolerability profile of nilotinib in newly diagnosed CML-AP, The toxicity criteria will be evaluated according to National Cancer Institute - Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE), version 3.0., 12 month|To test the efficacy of nilotinib 400 mg BID, To test the efficacy of nilotinib 400 mg BID in inducing complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) at 12 months in newly diagnosed CML-AP patients, 12 months
Evaluate the rate of complete hematologic response (CHR), Evaluate the rate of complete hematologic response (CHR) with nilotinib 400 mg BID at 3 months., 3 months|Evaluate the Quality of Life, Evaluate the Quality of Life by FACT-Leu Version 4 questionnaire at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 24 months., 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 24 months|Evaluate the median time to achieve molecular response, Evaluate the median time to achieve molecular response and the cumulative probability of obtaining molecular response during the first 2 years of treatment. This will be undertaken through the analysis of the best molecular response at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. MMR will be preferred and it will be defined as a BCR-ABL/ABL ratio â‰¤ 0.1% IS using RQ-PCR, but any log reduction between 1 and 4,5 logs will be considered a molecular response., uring the first 2 years of treatment|Evaluate the proportion of patients achieving CCyR, Evaluate the proportion of patients achieving CCyR at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months or undetectable BCR-ABL levels at 12, 18 and 24 months as well as the duration of sustained response., 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months or undetectable BCR-ABL levels at 12, 18 and 24 months|To correlate the probability of reaching MMR, CMR and CCyR, To correlate the probability of reaching MMR, CMR and CCyR with the risk of progression to blastic phase, relapse and overall survival., 2 years
Patients will be evaluated for safety throughout the study and for response every month for the first 3 months, then every 3 months thereafter up to month 24.

BCR-ABL transcripts measurement by QRT-PCR and mutation analyses will be done on peripheral blood samples and cytogenetic analyses on bone marrow aspirates.

Laboratory tests (hematology, blood chemistry), ECG and physical examination will be done on every visit.

Drug pharmacokinetics will be assessed in this study. For the screening Baseline periods, see chart attached
