In ENGAGE, a KWF Samenloop Voor Hoop subsidized project, we have developed VR movies to reduce fear and anxiety for patients who are going to be treated at Maastro. These movies are based on where most fear and anxiety are experienced and have been developed after extensive discussion with different disciplines in patient care and with agreement of the Director Patient Care. The movies include: 1) Mouldroom, 2) VMDIBH mamma photons, 3) Head and Neck photons, 4) Lung photons, 5) CT-scan, 6) Prostate photons, and 7) Head and Neck/ Neuro protons. Currently, the web-based 360째 movies are implemented in clinical practice and the VR glasses with the 360째 movies will be used as soon as social work has decided on where to integrate the use in the care pathway.
