A Biomarker Study to Identify Predictive Signatures of Response to LDE225 (Hedgehog Inhibitor) In Patients With Resectable Pancreatic Cancer
Pancreatic cancer is considered a rare form of cancer with about 277,000 new cases diagnosed in 2008 world-wide, which is about 2.5% of all forms of cancer. However, pancreatic cancer is more common in developed countries where the rate of this tumor is on the rise compared to other types of cancer.

LDE225 is a new medicine that blocks a cellular pathway (called Hedgehog pathway) that is thought to be changed in some patients with pancreatic cancer. LDE225 is a medicine which has not been approved by the FDA for the treatment of people with your medical condition. The medicine being tested in this study is currently not "on the market" (available to buy) in any country.

The purpose of this study is to see the effect LDE225 has on blood and tumors.
