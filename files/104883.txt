Comparison of Trelstar Versus Lupron or Zoladex in Advanced Prostate Cancer
This research study looks at Testosterone levels in patients receiving Trelstar versus those receiving Lupron or Zoladex. These drugs have been approved for treatment of Prostate Cancer by the FDA.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Trelstar|DRUG: Lupron|DRUG: Zoladex
Maintenance of serum testosterone at or below castration level (50ng/dL), Primary efficacy, 12 weeks
Serum testosterone level at end of study, Secondary efficacy, Week 12|Change in serum testosterone from baseline to end of study, Secondary efficacy, Baseline and week 12|Incidence and severity of adverse events, Treatment tolerability, 12 weeks
Patients who are currently receiving Lupron or Zoladex will be consented and then randomized to receive either continued treatment with the drug they have been on, or will be randomized to Trelstar for a period of 3 months. At the end of that period, testosterone and prostate serum antigen (PSA) levels will be drawn and compared to their previous levels to determine if Trelstar is as effective as the previous treatment.
