Using Artificial Intelligence for the Detection of Respiratory Diseases Associated With Pollution
Generating a picture at the city level, through geospatial and temporal grouping a lung diseases associated or exacerbated by pollution (COPD, AB and neoplasm pulmonary or pleural) and correlating this data with pollution data.

Development of an accurate and prognostic HRCT imaging diagnostic tool, computer assisted in the mentioned pathology, by generating an algorithm capable of to detect early the follow-up tomographic imaging lesions, as well as to evaluate objective their speed of evolution.

Validation of the proposed algorithm by comparison with medical diagnosis.
COPD Asthma|Lung Neoplasm|Emphysema
Correlation between lung diseases and pollution, Establishing the relationship between the incidence and exacerbation of lung diseases (COPD, acute bronchitis, and pulmonary or pleural neoplasms) and pollution levels through geospatial and temporal analysis at the city /county level, December 2023 - December 2024|Development of a diagnostic algorithm, Creating an accurate, computer-assisted HRCT imaging diagnostic tool designed to detect early tomographic lesions and evaluate the progression speed of these lesions in patients with the mentioned pathologies., September 2024 - March 2024
