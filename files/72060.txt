Neoantigen-based Personalized DNA Vaccine in Patients With Newly Diagnosed, Unmethylated Glioblastoma
This is a single institution, open-label, single arm, study assessing the safety, feasibility, and immunogenicity of a personalized neoantigen-based vaccine in subjects with newly diagnosed, unmethylated glioblastoma.
Glioblastoma
BIOLOGICAL: Personalized neoantigen DNA vaccine supplied by Geneos Therapeutics|DEVICE: CELLECTRA®2000 EP Device supplied by Geneos Therapeutics|DRUG: Plasmid encoded IL-12
Safety and tolerability of a personalized neoantigen DNA vaccine as measured by dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), A DLT will be defined as any grade 3 toxicity or greater according to CTCAE v5 considered at least possibly related to study treatment. The DLT observation period begins with Cycle 1 Day 1 (date of first vaccine administration) and continues for 30 days, Up to 30 days|Feasibility of generating a personalized neoantigen DNA vaccine for patients with newly diagnosed, unmethylated GBM as measured by the ability to identify candidate tumor-specific neoantigens, 4 weeks post-completion of radiotherapy (day 1 of treatment regimen)|Feasibility of generating a personalized neoantigen DNA vaccine for patients with newly diagnosed, unmethylated GBM as measured by the ability to manufacture a neoantigen-based DNA vaccine, 4 weeks post-completion of radiotherapy (day 1 of treatment regimen)|Feasibility of generating a personalized neoantigen DNA vaccine for patients with newly diagnosed, unmethylated GBM as measured by the ability to administer the vaccine to a patient, 4 weeks post-completion of radiotherapy (day 1 of treatment regimen)
Immunogenicity of a personalized neoantigen DNA vaccine as measured by the ability to generate a measurable neoantigen-specific CD8 T cell response in vaccinated patients, Week 10 post-vaccination|Immunogenicity of a personalized neoantigen DNA vaccine as measured by the number of individual neoantigens per number of neoantigens vaccinated against, with which a measurable CD8 T cell-specific response is identified, Week 10 post-vaccination|Number of high quality candidates neoantigens present in patients with newly diagnosed GBM, -High quality neoantigens will be defined as those that meet criteria for inclusion in a vaccine, Week 24 post-vaccination|Progression-free survival (PFS) rate, * PFS=duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first.
* Progression: any of the following

  * ≥ 25% increase in sum products of perpendicular diameters of enhancing lesions compared with the smallest tumor measurement obtained either at baseline or best response, on stable or increasing doses of corticosteroids\*. The absolute increase in any dimension must be at least 5mm when calculating the products.
  * Significant increase in T2/FLAIR nonenhancing lesion on stable/increasing doses of corticosteroids compared with baseline scan or best response after initiation of therapy\* not caused by comorbid events
  * New measureable lesion.
  * Clear clinical deterioration not attributable to other causes apart from the tumor (e.g. seizures, medication adverse effects, complications of therapy, cerebrovascular events, infection, and so on) or changes in corticosteroid dose., 6 months|Overall survival rate, 12 months|Immunogenicity of a personalized neoantigen DNA vaccine as measured by T-cell phenotype, myeloid derived suppressor cell frequency by flow cytometry, Week 24 post-vaccination|Immunogenicity of a personalized neoantigen DNA vaccine as measured by diversity of clonality from T cell receptor sequencing, Week 24 post-vaccination|Immunogenicity of a personalized neoantigen DNA vaccine as measured by putative antigen specificity from T cell receptor sequencing, Week 24 post-vaccination
