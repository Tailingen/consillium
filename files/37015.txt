FLT PET in Measuring Treatment Response in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Estrogen Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Stage I-III Breast Cancer
This clinical trial studies fluorine F 18 fluorothymidine (FLT) positron emission tomography (PET) in measuring treatment response in patients with newly diagnosed estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative stage I-III breast cancer. Comparing results of diagnostic procedures done before and during hormone therapy may help doctors predict a patient's response to treatment and help plan the best treatment.

Percent Change in Net Influx Constant (Ki) by FLT PET, Percent change between pre-treatment (baseline) and post-therapy PET measurements in breast tumors will be computed.

Association between Ki-67 and Ki by FLT (KFLT) decline will be analyzed using the mid-P adjustment to Fisher's exact test to evaluate the potential clinical utility of change in FLT as a biomarker for early response, using Ki-67 as the standard for early response., Baseline to up to 6 weeks|Percent Change in SUV by FLT PET, Percent change between pre-treatment (baseline) and post-therapy measurements of FLT standardized uptake value (SUV) in breast tumors will be computed., Baseline to up to 6 weeks|Percentage of Ki-67 Positive Tumor Cells in Surgical (Post-therapy) Sample, Surgically removed breast tumor tissue is stained using immuno-histochemistry techniques to visualize dividing cells expressing the Ki-67 protein, which is a cellular marker for proliferation., 1 to 6 weeks post-therapy start|Percentage Change in Ki-67 Positive Cells Between Pre-therapy and Post-therapy Tumor Specimens, Tumor tissue samples from pre-treatment (baseline) biopsy and post-treatment surgery are stained using immuno-histochemistry techniques to visualize dividing cells expressing the Ki-67 protein, which is a cellular marker for proliferation.

The % values of positive cells from the baseline and post-treatment samples are then compared for each individual patient.

Post-treatment Gene Expression Levels, Analyzed using BeadStudio software. Four clustering metrics for calculating dissimilarities (correlation, absolute correlation, Euclidean, and Manhattan) are available in BeadStudio and will be applied using standard analysis methods and diagnostics in BioConductor. To focus the analysis, proposed gene sets will be examined based on biological pathways and molecular signatures., 1 to 6 weeks post-therapy start|Pre-treatment Gene Expression Levels, Analyzed using BeadStudio software.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Measure the effect of a short course of endocrine therapy on primary breast cancer metabolism and proliferation by measuring changes in serial FLT PET measures pre and post a short course of endocrine therapy.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Compare changes in imaging measures to tissue measures of response, in particular antigen identified by proliferation-related Ki-67 antigen (Ki-67), in the pre-therapy biopsy versus the post-therapy surgical specimen.

II. Correlate imaging measures to measures of gene expression from pre and post therapy assays to determine if there are molecular changes associated with early response to therapy.

OUTLINE:

Patients undergo FLT PET at baseline and 1-6 weeks after the start of treatment.
