A Study to Evaluate Foretinib in Subjects With Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer
Foretinib (GSK1363089) is an investigational, oral, multikinase inhibitor involved in invasion, migration, and angiogenesis. This is a phase II, open label, uncontrolled, parallel, multi-cohort, multicenter 2-stage study to assess the safety and efficacy of foretinib and erlotinib combination therapy and foretinib monotherapy in genomic subpopulations of Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) subjects.
Cancer
DRUG: Foretinib|DRUG: Erlotinib
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR (confirmed Complete Response \[CR\] or confirmed partial response \[PR\]) will be assessed by investigator as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria., Screening, Cycle 3 Day 1, Cycle 5 Day 1, then every 3 cycles up to 2 years
Number of subjects with adverse events, From the first dose of study treatment up to 2 years|Clinical laboratory tests, Clinical laboratory assessments will include haematology, clinical chemistry and urinalysis parameters, From screening up to 2 years|Physical examinations, Physical examinations will include assessments of the head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, skin, thyroid, neurological, lungs, cardiovascular, abdomen (liver and spleen), lymph nodes and extremities, From screening up to 2 years|Vital signs, Vital sign measurements will include systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate, From screening up to 2 years|12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), Single 12-lead ECGs will be obtained at the scheduled time points, From screening up to 2 years|Electroretinogram (ERG) assessments, A thorough eye examination, including electroretinogram will be performed at the scheduled time points, From screening up to 2 years|Clinical benefit rate, Clinical benefit rate is the percentage of subjects with CR + PR + stable disease (SD), Screening, Cycle 3 Day 1, Cycle 5 Day 1, then every 3 cycles up to 2 years|Length of clinical benefit, Length of SD, Length of progression-free survival (PFS), length of survival from first dose to death, Screening, Cycle 3 Day 1, Cycle 5 Day 1, then every 3 cycles up to 2 years|Population pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters, Population PK parameters including the apparent clearance following oral dosing (CL/F), apparent volume of distribution following dosing (Vd/F), and the effect of combination therapy on CL/F will be estimated, Cycle 1 Day 8 and Cycle 1 Day 15
