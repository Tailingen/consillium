Internal Mammary Lymph Nodes Irradiation in High-risk Breast Cancer After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
The aim of this study is to explore the impact of internal mammary nodal irradiation on disease-free survival in high-risk breast cancer patients (ypN+or supra/subclavicular lymph node positive) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Breast Cancer
RADIATION: internal mammary nodal irradiation|RADIATION: No internal mammary node irradiation
Disease free survival, From date of enrollment until to the first recurrence in the ipsilateral breast or chestwall, the regional nodal area, or a distant site or death due to any cause, 5 years
Overall survival, From date of enrollment until the date of death from any cause., 5 years|Distant metastasis-free survival, The time of randomization to the first recurrence in a distant site., 5 years|Local-regional recurrence-free survival, The time of randomization to the first recurrence in the ipsilateral breast or chest wall and the regional nodal area., 5 years
This is a prospective, randomized phase 3 trial. Breast cancer patients with axillary lymph node-positive or supra/subclavicular lymph node metastasis underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy were included. Patients underwent regional nodal irradiation along with breast or chest wall irradiation and randomly allocated to either IMNI or no IMNI.
