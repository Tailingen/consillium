Sorafenib Combined With Transarterial Chemoembolization in Treating HBV-infected Patients With Intermediate Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is widely used for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the hypoxia caused by TACE in surviving tumor cell leads to release of angiogenic and growth factors contributing to poor outcome. Sorafenib can block tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis. The hypothesis is that patients with unresectable HCC may benefit from sorafenib in combination with TACE.
