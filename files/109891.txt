Pomalidomide in Combination With Low-dose Dexamethasone or Pomalidomide in Combination With Low-dose Dexamethasone and Daratumumab in Subjects With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma Following Lenalidomide-based Therapy in the First or Second Line Setting
This trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination of pomalidomide (POM) and low-dose dexamethasone (LD-Dex) (Cohort A) or the combination of pomalidomide (POM) , daratumumab (DARA) and low-dose dexamethasone (LD-Dex) (Cohort B) in subjects with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received a first or second line treatment of lenalidomide-based therapy.

This trial will test the hypothesis for Cohort A that the proportion of patients will have an Overall Response Rate (ORR) of \> 30 % to reveal that Pomalidomide is efficacious in pretreated patients who are refractory to lenalidomide.

This trial will test the hypothesis for Cohort B that the proportion of patients will have an Overall Response Rate (ORR) of \> 70 % to reveal that POM+DARA+LD-Dex is efficacious in pretreated patients who are refractory to lenalidomide.

This trial will test the hypothesis for Cohort C that the proportion of patients will have an Overall Response Rate (ORR) of \>60% to reveal that POM+DARA+LD-Dex is efficacious in pretreated patients who are refractory to lenalidomide. This treatment will be in only Japanese patients.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Pomalidomide|DRUG: Dexamethasone|DRUG: Daratumumab
Overall response rate (ORR), The primary endpoint will be the Overall Response Rate (ORR) by modified International Myeloma Working Group (mIMWG) criteria and will be based on the best response prior to the time frame. ORR will consist of the responses of PR or better (Complete Response -CR, Very Good Partial Response-VGPR or Partial Response- PR)., Approximately 2 years
Overall survival (OS), Overall survival will be calculated as the time from start of treatment until the time of death from any cause. If no death is recorded the subject will be censored at the time the subject was last known to be alive., Up to 7 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival will be calculated as the time from start of treatment until the time of PD (as determined by the site Investigator based on the mIMWG criteria) or death from any cause on study treatment, whichever comes first. Subjects not experiencing a documented progression will be censored at the time of their last response assessment (or at the time of trial enrollment if no assessment was conducted)., Up to 7 years|Duration of Response (DoR), Duration of response, calculated for responders only, is defined as time from the initial documented response (PR or better) to the first confirmed PD or until death from any cause. Subjects without a documented progression will be censored at the time of their last response assessment, Up to 7 years|Time to Response (TTR), Time to response, calculated for responders only, is calculated as the time from the start of treatment to the first documented response (PR or better) based on modified International Working Group ( mIMWG) criteria., Up to 2 years|Time to progression (TTP), Time to progression will be calculated as the time from start of treatment until PD (as determined by the site Investigator based on the mIMWG criteria) or death from progressive disease. Subjects not experiencing a documented progression will be censored at the time of their last response assessment (or at the time of trial enrollment if no assessment was conducted)., 6 months after 100% enrollment and 5 years from Last Patient First Visit|Adverse Events, Number of participants with adverse events including secondary primary malignancies., Up to 7 years
A phase 2, multicenter, multi-cohort, open-label study of pomalidomide in combination with low-dose dexamethasone or pomalidomide in combination with low-dose dexamethasone and daratumumab in subjects with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma following lenalidomide based therapy in the first or second line setting.

This trial will assess, Overall Response Rate (ORR), Overall Survival (OS), Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Duration of Response (DoR), Time to Response (TTR), Time to Progression(TTP) and safety.
