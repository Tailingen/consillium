Minimal Residual Disease-guided Adjuvant Therapy for Gastric Cancer
This is a multicenter, single-arm, interventional study to explore the feasibility of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)-MRD testing to guide postoperative adjuvant treatment strategies in patients with stage II-III gastric cancer.
Stage II-III Gastric Cancer
DRUG: MRD-guided therapy
