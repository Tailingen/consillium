A Study of Avastin (Bevacizumab) in Combination With Docetaxel and Cisplatin in Patients With Metastatic or Locally Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This study assessed the efficacy and safety of Avastin in combination with docetaxel and cisplatin as first-line treatment of patients with metastatic or locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Patients received Avastin 15 mg/kg intravenously (IV), docetaxel 75 mg/m\^2, and cisplatin 75 mg/m\^2 on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle for a maximum of 6 cycles.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Docetaxel
Progression-free Survival, Progression-free survival was defined as the time from enrollment in the study to the first documented disease progression using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) or death from any cause, whichever occurred first., Baseline to the end of the study (up to 4 years)
Percentage of Participants With an Objective Response, An objective response was defined as a complete or partial response determined on 2 consecutive occasions â‰¥ 4 weeks apart using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Complete response was defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must be \< 10 mm on the short axis. Partial response was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum., Baseline to the end of the study (up to 4 years)|Duration of the Objective Response, Duration of the objective response is defined as the time from a complete or partial response to disease progression or death due to disease., Baseline to the end of the study (up to 4 years)|Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from the first dose of study medication until death., Baseline to the end of the study (up to 4 years)|1-year Survival, The probability of surviving 1 year was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method., Baseline to 1 year
