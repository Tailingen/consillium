Fluzoparib and Camrelizumab in Treating Patients With R/M NPC That Progressed After First-line Chemotherapy
The aim of this study is to define the efficacy and safety of Fluzoparib and Camrelizumab in treating patients with recurrent/metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma that progressed after first-line chemotherapy.

Currently, the standard first-line treatment for recurrent/metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma is cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The recommended subsequent line therapy is single-agent chemotherapy or single-agent PD-1 antibody (nivolumab or pembrolizumab), according to NCCN guidelines (head and neck cancer, version 2021.3). However, the efficacy of nivolumab or pembrolizumab in subsequent line setting is limited, range from 20-30%. In order to improve the efficacy, we launch this study to evaluate whether combination treatment of PARP inhibitor (Fluzoparib) and PD-1 antibody (Camrelizumab) has the potential to increase efficacy in the subsequent line treatment, meanwhile has tolerable adverse effect.
