Incorporating Robotic Surgery in Both Mastectomy and DIEP Flap Reconstruction
A prospective study will be conducted to assess the outcomes of patients who underwent concurrent robotic-assisted mastectomy and robotic-assisted free DIEP flap harvest for breast reconstruction between March 2020 and June 25, 2023. Demographic data, including age, body mass index (BMI), and medical history, were collected, along with surgical time and perioperative parameters. The incidence of acute and chronic complications was documented.
