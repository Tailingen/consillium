A Phase Ⅱ Trials of Sintilimab as Consolidation Therapy After Radical Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy in Locally Advanced Unresectable ESCC
The purpose of this study is to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of Sintilimab for Consolidation Therapy After Radical Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy for Locally Advanced Unresectable Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Cisplatin+Capecitabine+Sintilimab
Progression-free survival（PFS）, Evaluation of anti-PD-1 antibody Sintilimab for progression-free survival in patients with locally advanced unresectable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who did not develop disease after radical concurrent chemoradiotherapy, up to 1 year
Objective Response Rate，ORR, To evaluate the objective response rate (objective response rate, ORR) of Sintilimab in patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who have not progressed after concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy, At time of surgery
Overall survival, OS, From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, At time of surgery|Exploratory analysis of biomarkers for predicting efficacy, The relationship between PD-L1 dynamic expression, ctDNA sequencing and therapeutic effect was evaluated, At time of surgery
In China, the incidence of esophageal cancer has declined in recent years, but the mortality rate has been ranked fourth. Morbidity and mortality were ranked sixth and fourth in all malignancies, respectively. Therefore, esophageal cancer has always been a major malignant tumor that threatens the health of our residents.We designed a single-arm, open-label, phase II trial of Sintilimab for consolidation therapy after radical concurrent chemoradiotherapylocally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.The purpose of this study is to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of Sintilimab for consolidation therapy after radical concurrent chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced unresectable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
