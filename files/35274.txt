A Study of NX-5948 in Adults With Relapsed/Refractory B-cell Malignancies
This is a first-in-human Phase 1a/1b multicenter, open-label study designed to evaluate the safety and anti-cancer activity of NX-5948 in patients with advanced B-cell malignancies.

Pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of NX-5948: Maximum Serum Concentration, Phase 1a / Phase 1b Part 1 and Part 2 - Sampling following the first dose, pre- and post-dose at selected cycles and at the end of treatment, Up to 6 years|Pharmacodynamic (PD) profile of NX-5948: Changes from baseline of BTK levels in B-cells, Phase 1a / Phase 1b Part 1 and Part 2 - Sampling at screening, following the first dose, pre and post-dose at selected cycles and at the end of treatment, Up to 6 years|Complete response (CR) rate / CR with incomplete marrow recovery as assessed by the Investigator, Phase 1a / Phase 1b Part 1 and Part 2, Up to 6 years|Duration of response (DOR) as assessed by the Investigator, Phase 1a / Phase 1b Part 1 and Part 2, Up to 6 years|Progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by the Investigator, Phase 1a / Phase 1b Part 1 and Part 2, Up to 6 years|Time to next therapy, Phase 1a / Phase 1b Part 1 and Part 2, Up to 6 years|Number of participants with treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs); Grade 3, 4, 5 TEAEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation, deaths due to TEAEs, and all deaths, Phase 1b Part 2, Up to 3 years
Phase 1a is a dose escalation to evaluate the safety and tolerability of NX-5948 in adult patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) B cell malignancies who have received at least 2 prior lines of therapy, or at least 1 prior line of therapy for Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL), and for whom no other therapies are known to provide clinical benefit. Indications include: Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL), Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL), Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia (WM), Marginal Zone Lymphoma (MZL), Follicular Lymphoma (FL), Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL) or any of the above indications with disease in the central nervous system or Secondary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (SCNSL).

Phase 1b Part 1, called safety expansion, investigates the safety and anti-tumor activity of NX-5948 at the dose(s) selected in Phase 1a in up to 17 expansion cohorts of patients with histologically confirmed B-cell malignancy indications who have received specified prior therapies based on indication:

* CLL or SLL (patients may be randomized to one of two dose levels investigated for CLL/SLL until an optimal dose is selected)
* MCL
* MZL
* WM
* DLBCL
* FL
* PCNSL/SCNSL

Phase 1b Part 2, called cohort expansion, will further investigate the anti-tumor activity of NX-5948 at the dose(s) selected in Phase 1b par 1 in one additional expansion arm of CLL/SLL patients.
