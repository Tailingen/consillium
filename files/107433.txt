CD70-targeted immunoPET Imaging of Malignant Cancers
This study aims to establish and optimize the cluster of differentiation (CD70)-targeted immuno-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (immunoPET/CT) imaging method and its physiological and pathological distribution characteristics, based on which the diagnostic efficacy of the above imaging agents in malignant cancers (renal cancer (especially clear cell renal cell carcinoma), lymphoma, or nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC)) will be evaluated.

The treatment regimens vary for different tumor types but involve chemotherapy, molecularly targeted therapies, immunotherapies (e.g. PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors), or cell therapies., 1-2 years
Histologically confirmed malignant cancers (renal cancer (especially clear cell renal cell carcinoma), lymphoma, or nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC)), or patients with suspected maligant cancers (renal cancer (especially clear cell renal cell carcinoma), lymphoma, or nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC)) indicated by conventional diagnostic imaging will be included. Patients will also be included for routine follow-up, surveillance, and treatment efficacy evaluation.

Enrolled patients will undergo whole-body immunoPET/CT scans 1-2 hours after tracer injection (0.05-0.1 mCi/kg). The uptake of imaging tracers in tumors and normal organs/tissues will be scored visually and quantitatively.

Tumor uptake will be quantified by the maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy will be calculated to assess the diagnostic efficacy. The correlation between lesion uptake and CD70 expression level determined by immunohistochemistry staining will be further analyzed. The primary exploration endpoint will be the tracers' imaging feasibility and preliminary diagnostic value compared to conventional imaging approaches like 18F-FDG PET/CT.
