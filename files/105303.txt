Different Durations of Adjuvant Anastrozole Therapy After 2 to 3 Years Tamoxifen Therapy in Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine whether 6 years adjuvant anastrozole will improve the disease free survival compared to 3 years adjuvant anastrozole in postmenopausal hormone sensitive breast cancer patients, subsequent to 2-3 years tamoxifen
Breast Cancer
