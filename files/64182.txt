Clinical Study Evaluating the Safety, Tolerability, and Preliminary Efficacy of LM-108 Â± Penpulimab+Chemotherapy in Advanced Solid Tumors - Cohort C
This trial is the cohort C part of a multicenter, open label Phase Ib/II clinical study evaluating the preliminary efficacy, safety, and tolerability of LM-108 combined with anti-tumor therapy in patients with advanced solid tumors. The dose of LM-108 combined with penpulimab, albumin paclitaxel, and gemcitabine is recommended in Phase Ib.Explore the efficacy and safety of LM-108 combined with anti-tumor therapy in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer in Phase II.
