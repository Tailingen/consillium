Study of BGB-11417 Monotherapy in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma
The study consists of two parts. Part 1 determines the safety and tolerability of BGB-11417 (sonrotoclax) monotherapy, the maximum tolerated dose, and the recommended Phase 2 dose of BGB-11417 monotherapy for relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma. Part 2 evaluates efficacy of BGB-11417 monotherapy at the recommended Phase 2 dose with recommended ramp-up schedule from Part 1.
Mantle Cell Lymphoma|Refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL)|Relapsed Mantle Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: BGB-11417
Part 1: Number Of Participants Experiencing Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs), Up to 1 Year|Part 1: Number of Participants Reporting One or More Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), and adverse events leading to discontinuation., Up to 5 Years|Part 1: Number of participants experiencing tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) relevant events, Up to 5 Years|Part 2: Overall Response Rate (ORR) as assessed by the Independent Review Committee (IRC), Defined as the proportion of participants who achieved a complete response (CR), or partial response (PR) per the Lugano Classification, Up to 4 Years
Part 1: Single Dose Area Under the Plasma Concentration Time Curve (AUC), Up to 2 Years|Part 1: Single Dose Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Up to 2 Years|Part 1: Single Dose Time to reach Cmax (Tmax), Up to 2 Years|Part 1: Steady State Area Under the Plasma Concentration Time Curve (AUC), Up to 2 Years|Part 1: Steady State Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Up to 2 Years|Part 1: Steady State Trough Plasma Concentration (CTrough), Up to 2 Years|Part 1: Steady State Time to reach Cmax (Tmax), Up to 2 Years|Overall Response Rate (ORR) as assessed by investigator, Defined as the proportion of participants who achieved a complete response (CR), or partial response (PR) per Lugano classification, Up to 4 Years|Duration of Response (DOR) as assessed by investigator and IRC, DOR is defined as the time from the date of the first documented response (PR or better) after treatment initiation until the date of first documented disease progression or death due to any cause; whichever occurs first, Up to 4 Years|Progression Free Survival (PFS) as assessed by investigator and IRC, PFS is defined as the time from the date of the first study dose until the date of first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 4 Years|Time to Response (TTR) as assessed by investigator and IRC, TTR is defined as the time from start of treatment to first documentation of response of Partial Response (PR) or better, Up to 4 Years|Overall Survival (OS), Defined as time from the start of treatment to the date of death due to any cause, Up to 4 Years|Part 2: Number of Participants Reporting One or More Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), and adverse events leading to discontinuation., Up to 4 Years|Part 2: Number of participants with clinically significant changes from baseline in vital signs, Vital signs include blood pressure and pulse rate, Up to 4 Years|Part 2: Number of participants with clinically significant changes from baseline in clinical laboratory values, Laboratory values include hematology, and clinical chemistry, Up to 4 Years|Part 2: Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Physical Examination Findings, A Physical examination includes head, ears, eyes, nose, mouth, skin, heart and lung examinations, lymph nodes, gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal systems, Up to 4 Years|Part 2: Participant Reported Outcomes as measured by NFLymSI-18, The National Comprehensive Cancer Network/Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Lymphoma Cancer Symptom Index-18 (FLymSI-18) questionnaire contains 18 items, each of which utilizes a Likert scale with 5 possible responses ranging from 0 'Not at all' to 4 'Very much' and is divided into a total score., Up to 4 Years|Part 2: Participant Reported Outcomes as measured by EQ-5D-5L questionnaires, The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system assesses health in five dimensions (MOBILITY, SELF-CARE, USUAL ACTIVITIES, PAIN / DISCOMFORT, ANXIETY / DEPRESSION), each of which has five levels of response (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, extreme problems/unable to). This part of the EQ-5D questionnaire provides a descriptive profile that can be used to generate a health state profile. Health state index scores generally range from less than 0 (where 0 is the value of a health state equivalent to dead; negative values representing values as worse than dead) to 1 (the value of full health), with higher scores indicating higher health utility. The second part of the questionnaire consists of a visual analogue scale (VAS) on which the participant rates his/her perceived health from 0 (the worst imaginable health) to 100 (the best imaginable health)., Up to 4 Years
