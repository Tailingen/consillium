Placing Trust in Endoscopic Ultrasonography: Impact on Planning Conformal Radiotherapy of Cancer of the Esophagus and Rectum
The purpose of this study is to estimate the rate of patients in whom a significant change in the area to be irradiated will be observed between the assessment before and after laying the evaluation of Trustees.
Oesophageal Cancer|Rectal Cancer
DEVICE: radio opaque markers (Echo Tip Ultra Fiducial Needle - ETUF)
Patients rate in which a significant variation in the area to be irradiated will be observed between before evaluation and evaluation after laying the trustees., Observing whether there is a significant variation of the area to be irradiated, From inclusion to 12 months follow up
Number of trustees (2 up 6 maximum) and set up their positions estimated success rate of implementation and the evaluation of the safety and toxicity (complications) associated with the establishment trustees (composite measure), Safety and security are measured by statistical analysis (numbers and percentage for qualitative variables and by average, median, standard deviations and extreme values for quantitative variables., From inclusion to 12 months follow up
The centering of radiotherapy is done with the pre-radiation scanner for tracking the implementation of target skin markers. On this scanner, it is often difficult for the radiation therapist to pinpoint the target volume. To improve the definition of the target volume, image fusion techniques with other imaging tests were developed.

To improve the pre-radiotherapy identification, setting up markers echo-endoscopy has been described without major complications. The impact on targeting radiotherapy was mainly described for the prostate.

The marking of digestive tumors was described by the establishment of Trustees, radiopaque markers in the lymph nodes, esophagus, stomach, pancreas, and bile ducts.
