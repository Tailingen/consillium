Efficacy and Safety of AK104 (PD-1/CTLA-4 Bispecial Antibody) Combined With Chemotherapy for Neoadjuvant Treatment of Advanced Ovarian Cancer
This is a randomized, controlled, single-center clinical study to evaluate AK104 in FIGO 2018 stage III-IV ovarian cancer subjects who were assessed to be at high perioperative risk and/or unable to achieve R0 resection prior to initial treatment. The efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant therapy with intravenous infusion combined with chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone.

R0 rate, Rate of complete tumor resection (R0): complete resection of the visible lesion., Up to 6 months
ORR, Objective tumor response rate is defined as the percentage of subjects having achieved confirmed Complete Response + Partial Response as best overall response according to radiological assessments., 1 year|DCR, Disease control rate (DCR) refers to the percentage of cases with remission and disease stability after treatment in the total number of evaluable cases., 1 year|pCR, Pathological complete response is the breast primary focus and axillary lymph node surgery specimen pathological examination without invasive tumor cell residual., 1 year|PFS, Progress free survival is defined as the length of time from random assignment to disease progression or to death resulting from any cause other than the progress., 1 year|AE, adverse events are evaluated according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0., 1 year
Subjects in the experimental group received AK104 combined chemotherapy for 3-4 cycles (determined by the investigator) before surgery, and subjects in the control group received chemotherapy for 3-4 cycles (determined by the investigator) before surgery. Treatment until unless intolerable toxicity occurs, informed consent is withdrawn, or other criteria for discontinuation are met.

The study treatment was followed by a 3-week treatment cycle. The dosing time window is Â±3 days. Within 72 hours before each dosing cycle, subjects are required to complete various examinations, including vital signs, physical examination, laboratory examination, and physical status score, to evaluate the safety and tolerability of continued treatment.
