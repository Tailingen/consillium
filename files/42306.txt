UCD19 CAR T Therapy in Adults With B-ALL and MRD Positivity in CR1
This open-label, single arm Phase 1/1b trial aims to determine the safety and tolerability of anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor-expressing (CAR) T cells (UCD19 CAR T) in adults with B-ALL that are in first complete remission with MRD positivity. This trial will enroll 10 patients during Phase 1 for apheresis, treatment with lymphodepleting chemotherapy, and UCD19 CAR T cell infusion. Patients will be assessed for DLTs (within 42 days after CAR T infusion) to determine a maximum tolerated dose (MTD), duration of B cell aplasia, overall response rate (at 1-3-, 6- and 12-months), and overall survival and event free survival (at 12- and 24- months) post UCD19 CAR T infusion.

After the initial dose escalation phase, an additional 12 participants will be enrolled in the dose expansion at the MTD to determine preliminary efficacy.

Safety of UCD19 CAR T in Adults With B-ALL in first complete remission with MRD Positivity: occurrence and frequency of Adverse Events (AEs), The occurrence and frequency of Adverse Events will be graded using the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 grading criteria., Up to 30 days after last day of study participation|Safety of UCD19 CAR T in Adults With B-ALL in first complete remission with MRD Positivity: occurrence of Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), Adverse events that are at least possibly related to the UCD19 CAR T cells with onset within the first 42 days following UCD19 CAR T cell infusion and are â‰¥ Grade 3 in severity will be considered DLTs.

With exception to hematological toxicity for subjects with normal, Grade 1 or Grade 2 Hematologic Parameters at baseline (independent of transfusion) and cytopenias NOT due to Bone Marrow Involvement by Disease. However, any Grade 4 hematological toxicity (i.e., neutropenia or thrombocytopenia with the exception of lymphopenia) persisting beyond 42 days after infusion will be considered a DLT unless toxicity is attributed to patient's underlying disease., 42 days|Preliminary efficacy of UCD19 CAR T infusion at the MTD in adult B-ALL patients at first complete remission with MRD positivity, Determine the Relapse Free Survival (RFS) rate post UCD19 CAR T infusion. RFS will be measured from the date of infusion of the UCD19 CAR T product to the time of relapse or death from any cause, 12 and 24 months
Overall response rate (ORR) at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months post UCD19 CAR T infusion as measured by MRD., MRD negativity is defined as bone marrow that has no detectable blasts at or above the sensitivity threshold for the particular assay used (approximately 0.01% for FACS-MRD, 0.001% for BCR-ABL qPCR, 0.0001% for IgH/TCR NGS).

MRD positivity post UCD19 CAR T infusion is defined as \> 0.01% by FACS or a rising number of \> 0 clonal sequences by NGS (clonoSEQ) at two timepoints at least 2-4 weeks apart in the bone marrow or peripheral blood for Ph- ALL, and either \> 0.01% by FACS, a rising number of \> 0 clonal sequences by NGS (clonoSEQ), or less than complete molecular remission (undetectable BCR-ABL1 transcripts by quantitative PCR assay with sensitivity of at least 1 in 100,000) at two timepoints at least 2-4 weeks apart in the bone marrow or peripheral blood for Ph+ ALL., 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months|Overall Survival (OS) at 12 and 24 months post UCD19 CAR T infusion., OS defined as measured from the date of infusion to the time of death from any cause., 12 and 24 months|Event Free Survival (EFS) at 12 and 24 months post UCD19 CAR T infusion, EFS is defined as failure to achieve MRD-negativity (approximately 0.01% for FACS-MRD, 0.001% for BCR-ABL qPCR), disease relapse, or death from any cause from the date of infusion, 12 and 24 months
Duration of B-cell aplasia, B-cell aplasia defined as \<3.0% CD19+ cells/total lymphocytes by peripheral blood flow cytometry., 12 months|Assessment of minimal residual disease by next generation sequencing, MRD by next generation sequencing for clonal B-cell receptor gene rearrangements, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months
