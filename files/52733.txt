Germ Cell Tumor and Testicular Tumor DNA Registry
This study is being done to create a registry to help us learn more about germ cell tumors (GCT) and other testicular tumors. The registry will include people with these tumors and also relatives and unrelated people without these tumors. This study will help us learn more about the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and outcome of these tumors. Studying relatives of patients and people unrelated to patients with GCT and other testicular tumors will help us understand why some people get these tumors and why some people don't.
