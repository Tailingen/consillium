This is a single arm, phase II, multicenter study trial evaluating Pembrolizumab in recurrent platinum resistant CPS score \>1 positive ovarian, Fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancer patients. All the eligible patients will receive Pembrolizumab 200 mg d1 q 21 iv infusion in 30 minutes, until disease progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity or patient's refusal. Pembrolizumab will be administered for a maximum of 2 years.

The primary objective of the study is to assess overall survival (OS) of patients treated with Pembrolizumab single agent.
