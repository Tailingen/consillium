A Real-world Study of Inetetamab for First-line Treatment of MBC
This is a prospective, multicenter, real-world study aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of inetetamab+chemotherapy or inetetamab+pyrotinib+chemotherapy or inetetamab+pertuzumab+chemotherapy in the treatment of HER2 positive inoperable locally advanced or recurrent metastatic breast cancer. The research results will provide new targeted treatment strategies for HER2 positive breast cancer patients.

Progression-Free Survival, The survival time from the date of randomization to the date of the first documented progression or date of death, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months
Objective Response Rate, The total rate of CR+PR after the completion of two cycles of treatment., From date of randomization until the date at the end of the second treatment cycle (42 days)|Overall survival, The time from randomization to death from any cause, The time from randomization to death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months|Adverse Events, All adverse events \[including adverse events (AE / SAE) and ADR (adverse drug reactions)\] will be collected when known. The classification of adverse reactions shall refer to CTCAE5.0 in case of adverse events / reactions. In case of serious adverse events, the investigators must immediately take necessary treatment measures to protect the safety of subjects. All adverse events / reactions should be tracked and observed. If the adverse events have not recovered, the investigator shall continue to give necessary treatment, report and record, and deal with special cases according to the management opinions of relevant departments., The time from randomization to reach the endpoint, assessed up to 60 months
