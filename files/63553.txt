Observational Study on CML Patients in Any Phase of the Disease Treated With Ponatinib (Iclusig®)
This is a multicentre ambispective cohort study involving French patients who have started or are receiving for less than 6 months a treatment with ponatinib. This study aims at better qualifying the ponatinib benefit-risk balance in real life and in relation with CML patients' therapeutic history.
Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
