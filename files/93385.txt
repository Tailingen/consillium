A Study of PM8002 Plus Nab-paclitaxel as First Line Therapy for TNBC
Here, the investigators present the results from a Phase Ib/II study of PM8002 in combination with nab-paclitaxel in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic triple negative breast cancer without previous systematic treatment.

Objective Response Rate, Objective response rate (ORR) is the proportion of subjects with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), based on RECIST v1.1, Up to approximately 2 years|Treatment related adverse events (TRAEs), The incidence and severity of TRAEs graded according to NCI-CTCAE v5.0, Up to 30 days after last treatment]
Disease control rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the proportion of subjects with CR, PR, or stable disease(SD) based on RECIST v1.1., Up to approximately 2 years|Duration of response (DoR), DoR is defined as the duration from the first documentation of objective response to the first documented disease progression (based on RECIST v1.1) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 2 years|Progression free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the start of treatment until the first documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first (based on RECIST v1.1)., : Up to approximately 2 years|Overall survival (OS), OS is the time from the date of first dosing date to death due to any cause., Up to approximately 2 years
PD-L1 and VEGF play important roles in immune escape and tumor angiogenesis and enhance cancer growth and metastasis. PM8002 is a bispecific antibody targeting PD-L1 and VEGF-A. Here, the investigators present the results from a Phase Ib/II study of PM8002 in combination with nab-paclitaxel in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic triple negative breast cancer without previous systematic treatment.
