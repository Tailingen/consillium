STernectOmy Repair Efficiency of a Ceramic Implant
For the replacement of the sternum, there is no consensus regarding the most appropriate and most effective physiologically material. The use of ceramic implant offers significant operational time saving and biocompatibility coupled with the strength of the material allow us to realize a more natural operation, limiting the risk of infection and rejection.

Main objective: to evaluate the efficiency of the replacement of the sternum by a ceramic implant on the respiratory capacity at 3 months post surgery.
