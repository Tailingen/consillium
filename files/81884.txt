Study of Bcl-2 Inhibitor Sonrotoclax (BGB-11417) in Participants With Mature B-Cell Malignancies
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability; and to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D); and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the ramp-up dosing schedule and at the RP2D of BGB-11417 monotherapy, and when given in combination with zanubrutinib and obinutuzumab.
