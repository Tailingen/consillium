Study to Evaluate Efficacy and Safety of Histrelin Subdermal Implant in Men With Advanced Prostate Cancer
Objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the histrelin acetate subdermal implant (originally versus Lupron Depot-3 Month) in male patients with advanced prostate cancer during 52 weeks of treatment with the implant. After consultation w/ FDA, design was modified to eliminate the Lupron arm and continued the study as an open-label non-randomized study.

Primary endpoint was testosterone suppression, as assessed by the percent of patients whose testosterone indicated chemical castration levels (\<=50 ng/dL) through 52 weeks of treatment with an implant.
Prostate Cancer|Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate
DRUG: histrelin acetate
Suppression of testosterone to chemical castration levels (<= 50 ng/dL), 52 weeks
PSA measurements, 52 weeks|Pain measurements, 52 weeks|QoL outcomes, 52 weeks
Other outcome measures included serum levels of LH, PSA, as well as non-clinical assessments, eg, WHO Performance Status, pain level assessment, and quality of life questionnaires. Safety was evaluated via adverse events, vital signs, clinical laboratory outcomes, physical examinations, and ECGs. Local tolerability outcomes were also evaluated.

An extension period for the study included annual replacement of the implant until the implant was approved by the FDA (October 12, 2004). Efficacy and safety were followed during the extension period.
