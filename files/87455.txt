Metformin to Prevent Late Miscarriage and Preterm Delivery in Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
The overall aim of the PregMet 2 Study is to investigate whether metformin prevents late miscarriages and preterm deliveries in PCOS women treated with metformin from first trimester of pregnancy to delivery in a large, randomized, controlled, multi-centre trial setting.

The investigators hypothesis is that metformin compared to placebo treatment from the first trimester to term, reduces the prevalence of late miscarriage (gestational week 13-22) and preterm birth (gestational week \< 37) in PCOS women diagnosed according to Rotterdam 2003 consensus criteria, with singleton pregnancy.
