TSR-042 in Addition to Standard of Care Definitive Radiation for Inoperable Endometrial Cancer
Patients with inoperable endometrial cancer have limited treatment options. PD-L1 expression is common in endometrial cancers and RT induces tumor and systemic changes that induce the immune system. The purpose of this trial is to evaluate anti-PD-1/PD-L1 axis therapy in conjunction of standard of care RT for patients with inoperable endometrial cancer in order to establish the safety and efficacy of inducing an anti-tumor immune response.
Endometrial Cancer|Cancer of the Endometrium
DRUG: TSR-042|RADIATION: Brachytherapy|PROCEDURE: Endometrial biopsy|PROCEDURE: Blood draw for immune response
Safety and tolerability of the regimen as measured by the grade of toxicities experienced as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, Through 30 days after completion of treatment (estimated to be 10 weeks)
Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from last TSR-042 administration to disease progression or death. Response and progression will be evaluated in this study in a qualitative fashion by symptoms (such as bleeding, abdominal or pelvic pain, changes of bowel or bladder habits lasting more than two weeks), clinical exam and/or evidence of disease on imaging by RECIST 1.1 as not all patients will have measurable disease at baseline on imaging. Persistent/recurrent clinical disease will be confirmed by biopsy whenever possible., 2 years
