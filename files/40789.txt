Clinical Benefit Response for PF-04691502, Clinical benefit response was defined as best overall response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) for at least 16 weeks from Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1) to the first time of disease progression. The outcome data table below presents the number of participants with clinical benefit response as "yes" or "no". On 09 Oct 2012, Pfizer decided to stop enrollment into PF-04691502. While tumor assessment for PF-04691502 was included as a listing in the final report, formal efficacy analysis for PF-04691502 was not performed., 16 weeks from Cycle 1 Day 1|Percentage of Participants With Clinical Benefit Response for PF-05212384, Clinical benefit response was defined as best overall response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) for at least 16 weeks from Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1) to the first time of disease progression. The primary analysis is based on the clinical benefit rate which is calculated as proportion of participants with a clinical benefit response relative to total number of response evaluable participants. Per RECIST v1.1 for target lesions: CR defined as disappearance of all target lesions; PR defined as \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; SD does not qualify for CR, PR or Progression. All target lesions must be assessed. SD can follow PR only in the rare case that the sum increases by less than 20% from the nadir, but enough that a previously documented 30% decrease no longer holds. A Clopper-Pearson exact 95% CI for the clinical benefit rate is presented in the below table., 16 weeks from Cycle 1 Day 1
Objective Response for PF-04691502, Objective response is defined as CR or PR. CR: Complete response: 2 or more objective statuses of CR a minimum of 4 weeks apart documented before PD. Partial response: 2 or more objective statuses of PR or better a minimum of 4 weeks apart documented before PD, but not qualifying as CR. Per RECIST v1.1 for target lesions: CR defined as disappearance of all target lesions; PR defined as \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions.

PFS was characterized in terms of the median. Approximate 95% confidence interval corresponding to this estimate was computed. Progression is defined using RECIST v1.1, as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions with a minimum absolute increase of 5 mm, or an unequivocal progression of non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions.

PFS was characterized in terms of the probability of remaining progression-free at 6 months (based on Kaplan-Meier estimates).

Each slide was imaged by whole slide scanning and patient samples were scored as follows:

* Pathologist manual score (0, 1+, 2+, 3+) for overall staining intensity of tumor tissue.
* Percentage of positive tumor cells staining at 0, 1+, 2+, and 3+.
* H-score value (integer between 0 and 300) for tumor cell staining was calculated. The higher the stathmin staining, the higher the stathmin H-score., Prior to Cycle 1 Day 1|Percentage of Participants in Each Treatment Arm With Gene and/or Protein Expression Biomarkers- PIK3CA Amplification, KRAS Mutation P/N, KRAS Mutation OBSV, PTEN Stroma Manual Score, PTEN Tumor Manual Score, KRAS SCC and Stathmin H/L,Tissue., Gene and/or protein expression biomarkers in biopsied tumor tissue relating to PI3K and/or mTOR pathway activation, such as PIK3CA and PIK3R1 mutations, Phosphatase And Tensin Homolog (PTEN) protein levels, and PIK3CA gene amplification were to be assessed.

Stained tissues were evaluated by a board-certified pathologist who provided a manual pathology score (i.e., 0, 1+, 2+, or 3+) and, if appropriate, comments upon the staining of the specimen.

The directionality increases from 0 to 3+ with 0 being no staining for PTEN by IHC and 3+ being high staining intensity for PTEN., Baseline and Cycle1 to Cycle 5 where each cycle consist of 28 days|Area Under the Serum Concentration Time Profile From Time Zero Extrapolated to Infinity (AUCinf) of PF-05212384 at Each Specified Time Points., Pre-dose: 0 hours, and Post dose: 0.5 (after end of infusion), 1, 2, 4, 6, 24, 72, and 120 hours at Day 1|Area Under the Serum Concentration Time Profile From Time Zero to the Time of the Last Quantifiable Concentration (AUClast) of PF-05212384 at Each Specified Time Points., Pre-dose: 0 hours, and Post dose: 0.5 (after end of infusion), 1, 2, 4, 6, 24, 72, and 120 hours at Day 1|Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of PF-05212384 at Each Specified Time Points., Pre-dose: 0 hours, and Post dose: 0.5 (after end of infusion), 1, 2, 4, 6, 24, 72, and 120 hours at Day 1|Terminal Elimination Half Life (t½) of PF-05212384 at Each Specified Time Points., Pre-dose: 0 hours, and Post dose: 0.5 (after end of infusion), 1, 2, 4, 6, 24, 72, and 120 hours at Day 1|Time for Cmax (Tmax) of PF-05212384 at Each Specified Time Points., Pre-dose: 0 hours, and Post dose: 0.5 (after end of infusion), 1, 2, 4, 6, 24, 72, and 120 hours at Day 1|Clearance (CL) of PF-05212384 at Each Specified Time Points., Pre-dose: 0 hours, and Post dose: 0.5 (after end of infusion), 1, 2, 4, 6, 24, 72, and 120 hours at Day 1|Steady State Volume of Distribution (Vss) of PF-05212384 at Each Specified Time Points., Pre-dose: 0 hours, and Post dose: 0.5 (after end of infusion), 1, 2, 4, 6, 24, 72, and 120 hours|Number of Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) - All Causalities, Safety of participants in terms of TEAEs.

The study was prematurely discontinued due to lack confidence in the Stathmin assay as a patient selection criteria and subsequent lack of confidence in the efficacy signal that was observed. The decision to terminate the study was made on January 23, 2014. It should be noted that safety concerns have not been seen in this study and have not factored into this decision.
