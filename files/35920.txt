A Study of Neoadjuvant Atezolizumab Plus Chemotherapy Versus Placebo Plus Chemotherapy in Patients With Resectable Stage II, IIIA, or Select IIIB Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (IMpower030)
This is a randomized, double-blinded study designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of neoadjuvant treatment with atezolizumab (MPDL3280A) or placebo in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy in participants with resectable Stage II, IIIA, or select IIIB non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) followed by open-label adjuvant/postoperative atezolizumab or best supportive care and monitoring.
