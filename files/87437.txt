Prospective Study of Particle Radiotherapy for Breast Cancer With Different Arm Position
The optical body surface image (C-RAD) was used to guide and track the change of positions, and multimodal images (including 2D X-ray images, CT images and PET-CT images) were used to verify the treatment positions. In order to explore the accuracy of breast cancer patients' treatment positions and its impact on dose of the new fixation device in two different fixed positions of arm up and arm down, optimize the position fixed equipment and methods of particle radiotherapy for breast cancer, and then establish the precision process of particle radiotherapy for breast cancer under the guidance of multimodal images. In a word, this is a dosimetry and prospective Phase II randomized clinical study of the accuracy of multi-modal guided particle radiotherapy for postoperative breast cancer with different arm position.

DEVICE: Fixed positions of arm down and arm up
The accuracy of multi-modal guided particle radiotherapy for postoperative breast cancer with different immobilization position, The optical body surface image (C-RAD) was used to guide and track the change of positions, and multimodal images (including 2D X-ray images, CT images and PET-CT images) were used to verify the treatment positions. In order to explore the accuracy of breast cancer patients' treatment positions and its impact on dose of the new fixation device in two different fixed positions of arm up and arm down, optimize the position fixed equipment and methods of particle radiotherapy for breast cancer, and then establish the precision process of particle radiotherapy for breast cancer under the guidance of multimodal images., within 3 months after radiotherapy
