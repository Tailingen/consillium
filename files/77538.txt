Pharmacogenomic Study of Neoadjuvant Eribulin for HER2 Non-overexpressing Breast Cancer
This is a prospective, non-randomized, open-label, multicenter, single-arm exploratory pharmacogenomic study of single agent eribulin as neoadjuvant therapy in patients with operable Stage III HER2 non-overexpressing breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Eribulin
