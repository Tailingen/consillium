Low-Level Laser Effects on Orthodontic Tooth Movement of Periodontally Compromised Patients.
To investigate the effect of Low Level Laser therapy on orthodontic tooth movement of periodontally compromised patients by evaluating the rate of orthodontic tooth movement and the level of Osteocalcin in the gingival crevicular fluid.
Periodontal Diseases|Cancer Metastatic|Orthodontic Tooth Movement
DEVICE: Biolase ;Low Level Laser
Rate of orthodontic tooth movement, Rate of mandibular canine retraction, 6 months
Osteocalcin level in GCF, Gingival Crevicular Fluid samples will be collected from al target teeth in both groups to detect osteocalcin level after start of orthodontic treatment and at the end of the study, 6 months
Low-Level laser therapy has been reported as an effective adjunct to non surgical periodontal treatment for inflammation control and tissue reparation in patients with periodontitis. Previous studies have shown that application of low-level laser therapy reduced pocket depth and decreased the inflammatory process through regulatory control of inflammatory cytokines level, therefore this study will investigate the effect of low-level laser on the periodontal tissue .Accelerating orthodontic tooth movement is one of the primary demand in orthodontics to prevent side effects as root resorption, caries and decreased patient compliance . Numerous researchers have also studied the use of LLLT in accelerating orthodontic tooth movement and have considered the laser to be effective while others achieved the opposite . Hence, This study is aiming to investigate the effects of LLLT in accelerating tooth movement.
