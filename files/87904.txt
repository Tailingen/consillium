A Study of Cabozantinib Compared With Placebo in Subjects With Radioiodine-refractory Differentiated Thyroid Cancer Who Have Progressed After Prior Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor (VEGFR) -Targeted Therapy
The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of cabozantinib compared with placebo on progression free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR) in subjects with Radioiodine-Refractory Differentiated Thyroid Cancer (DTC) who have progressed after prior vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-Targeted therapy.
Differentiated Thyroid Cancer
DRUG: Cabozantinib|DRUG: Placebo
Progression Free Survival (PFS), Time to the earlier of either radiographic progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause., Up to approximately twenty months after the first subject is randomized. Time from randomization to the earlier of the following events: radiographic PD as determined by the blinded independent central review (BIRC) or death due to any cause.|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Proportion of subjects with the best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)., Six months after 100 subjects are randomized. Time from randomization to best overall response of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) per BIRC per RECIST 1.1.
