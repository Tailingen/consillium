Liposomal Cytarabine in the Treatment of Central Nervous System Resistant or Relapsed Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in Children
The purpose of this study is to describe the activity and toxicity of a new formulation of cytarabine called liposomal cytarabine given into the central nervous system for the treatment of central nervous system localization of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in children and adolescents.
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
DRUG: liposomal cytarabine
number of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) responses, from two weeks after date of patient registration until the date of second consecutive cerebrospinal fluid exam that is negative for malignant cells, up to 12 weeks|number of patients with grade 3 or higher neurological adverse events, excluding headache) according to CTCAE 4.02, assessed from date of patient registration to date of cerebrospinal fluid response, up to 12 weeks
time to reaching CSF response, date of reaching CSF response is the first date of two consecutive negative cytomorphologic exams of CSF, date of patient registration to date of CSF response, up to 12 weeks|duration of CSF response, duration of response is the length of time in days from the date of the CSF response to the date of the first positive cytomorphologic CSF exam, up to 12 months|worst grade non neurologic Adverse event during induction, according to CTCAE 4.02, up to 12 weeks|worst grade toxicity after induction therapy according to CTCAE 4.02, Measured from date of CSF response, up to 12 months|overall survival, one year|time from patient registration to progression of disease in non CNS site, up to one year|concentration of study drug present in CSF at each induction therapy, prior to each induction therapy at 15 day intervals for up to 6 cycles|correlation of activity and toxicity with residual study drug level in CSF during induction, measured at 15 day intervals for up to 6 cycles
Liposomal cytarabine (DepoCyte) is a new formulation of the drug cytarabine, a drug commonly used in the treatment of ALL. This formulation of the drug can be given intrathecally (into the spinal fluid), and is released slowly over a longer period, about two weeks. This allows a longer exposure of the drug to the central nervous system, and requires fewer intrathecal injections for the patient.
