The Effect of Melatonin on Depression, Anxiety, Cognitive Function and Sleep Disturbances in Breast Cancer Patients
The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of 6 mg melatonin daily for 1 week preoperatively to 12 weeks postoperatively on depressive symptoms, anxiety, cognitive function and sleep disturbances in breast cancer patients. Furthermore the investigators will examine whether a specific clock-gene (HPER3) is correlated with an increased risk of depression, sleep disturbances or cognitive dysfunction.

Major Depression Inventory (MDI)- Depression at One Point in the Study, MDI is a self-rating depression scale with 12 questions. MDI has previously been investigated in a Danish population. On a six-point Likert scale, the items measure how much time the symptoms have been present during the last 14 days. MDI is scored according to specific guidelines and can be used either as a rating scale or diagnostic instrument.

For inclusion we used the diagnostic instrument (depression was an exclusion criteria) and for all other MDI measurements we used the rating scale.

Diagnostic scale using the ICD-10 algorithm:

Mild depression: 2 core symptoms and 2 other symptoms Moderate depression: 2 core symptoms and 4 other symptoms Severe depression: 3 core symptoms and 5 other symptoms

Rating scale:

No depression - score from 0-20 Mild depression - score from 21-25 Moderate depression - score from 26-30 Severe depression - score from 31-50, Depression at one point in the study (not including baseline) out of 4 measurements at app. day 21, day 35, day 63 and day 91 of the study.|Per Protocol - Depression at One Point in the Study Period, MDI is a self-rating depression scale with 12 questions.

We evaluated changes from the preoperative baseline to the 2 postoperative test sessions. In controls we calculated mean and standard deviations (SD) of these differences. The mean change in this group may be taken as estimated learning effects. For the individual patients, we compared baseline scores with the 2- and 12-week postoperative test results, subtracted the average learning effect from the changes and divided the result by the SD of the control group to obtain a Z score for the 7 individual test outcomes. A large positive Z score indicated deterioration in cognitive function from baseline in patients. We defined a composite Z score as the sum of the 7 Z scores and normalized this using the SD for that sum in the controls. POCD was defined as a combined Z score \>1.96 or a Z score \>1.96 in at least 2 of the 7 subtests.

About 1.4 million women are diagnosed with breast cancer every year. Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women worldwide constituting about 1/5 of all cancer types. Breast cancer diagnosis and treatment, and the months following primary therapy are stressful times for most women. Aside from the actual "cancer threat" many women experience various degrees of depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances and memory/concentration problems (cognitive dysfunction). Naturally these factors influence the quality of life but also contribute to morbidity and mortality.

Melatonin is a regulatory circadian hormone having, among others, hypnotic, sedative, anxiolytic and possibly anti-depressive effects. It has very low toxicity and very few adverse effects.

The purpose of this project is to test melatonin (6 mg daily for 1 week preoperatively to 12 weeks postoperatively) on breast cancer patients and hopefully hereby be able to prevent depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances and cognitive dysfunction. On an overall perspective this will hopefully contribute to improving the quality of life for these patients and extend their lifetime. Furthermore the investigators will be examining whether a specific gene called a clock-gene (HPER3) is correlated with an increased risk of depression, sleep disturbances or cognitive dysfunction. If this is the case it could become possible to identify women with an increased risk and provide prophylactic treatment for those with a risk of developing a depression, sleep disturbances or cognitive disturbances.

Sample size calculations were based on our primary outcome parameter. Using a conservative estimate for the incidence of depression, the investigators expect to find a reduction from 30% to 15% with melatonin treatment. Sample size is sufficient to include our secondary and tertiary outcome parameters as well. The sample size calculations were calculated with a power of 80%, a type I error of 5% and a type II error of 20%.
