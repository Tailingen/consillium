Observational Study of Best Supportive Care With or Without Surgery, Chemo or Radiotherapy in Pts With Carcinoma of Lung
The purpose of this study is to establish a listing (database) of patients diagnosed with lung cancer and treated with best supportive care and standard and investigational chemotherapy regimens, surgery, and radiation therapy at the UNM CRTC and other NMCCA sites. The information will be used to determine the results of various treatments for lung cancer subjects and to find where improvements can be made in safety, effectiveness, supportive care, treatment that eases tumors without curing them, treatments that cure tumors, prevention, and follow-up efforts. The database information will be compared to clinical trial data published in peer-reviewed journals and SEER outcome data. Patients will be acquired both before and after they are treated for lung cancer.
Lung Cancer
To document the progression-free survival, rate of response, median duration of response, & median overall survivals, of subjects receiving best supportive care with or without standard surgery, chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy for lung cancer, 3-6 months
To document the incidence and severity of toxicities, and reversibility of toxicities of subjects as a function of the treatments rendered., 3-6 months
Same as above.
