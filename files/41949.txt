Clinical Study of Taurine Combined With Sintilimab and Chemotherapy for Treatment of Advanced Gastric Cancer
This project aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral taurine supplementation combined with PD-1 inhibitor (sintilimab) and chemotherapy in inducing systemic CD8+ T cell responses and achieving improved gastric cancer patient outcomes than with sintilimab and chemotherapy alone.

Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression (PD) per RECIST 1.1 based on independent radiology review or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 24 months|Overall survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause., Up to 24 months
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST 1.1 criteria., Up to 24 months|Safety profile, Number of study subjects experiencing adverse events (AEs), dose-limiting toxicities, and serious adverse events (SAEs). Safety profile will be assessed through laboratory evaluations, vital signs, and physical examinations., Up to 24 months
Changes in CD8+ T cell death and function, Changes in number, apoptosis rate, effector (TNF-α, IFN-γ, etc.) production and immune checkpoint molecule (PD-1, CTLA-4, etc.) expression of CD8+ T cells in peripheral venous blood assessed via flow cytometry., Up to 24 months|Changes in CD8+ T cell infiltration in tumor tissue, Changes in number, effector (TNF-α, IFN-γ, etc.) production and immune checkpoint molecule (PD-1, CTLA-4, etc.) expression of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells in gastric cancer endoscopic biopsy material assessed via immunohistochemistry., Up to 24 months
