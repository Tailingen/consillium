Predictive Clinical and Biological Parameters in Acute Leukemia, Myelodysplastic Syndromes and Myeloproliferative Disorders-HEMATO-BIO-IPC-2013-015
HEMATO-BIO-IPC-2013-015 is a monocenter prospective longitudinal study. Our aim is to define predictive clinical and biological factors in acute leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative disorders by using genomics, genetics and epigenetics, in vitro and in vivo drug sensitivity studies,and translational immonulogy and immunomonitoring studies.

HEMATO-BIO primary outcome measure is to identify molecular, genomic and epigenetic, pharmacologic and immunophenotypic alteration in acute leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative disorders by collecting, at diagnosis and/or complete remission and/or relapse:

* tumor samples: marrow aspiration, blood sampling.
* non-tumor samples: skin biopsy, buccal swab . from 650 patients treated at our cancer center.
