Dose Escalation Phase (Phase IIa ):Including 10-20 patients for dose escalation, the enrollment will continue until about 10 patients in the dose group with response, as to determine Recommended Phase II dose (RP2D).

Dose Expansion Phase (Phase IIb):Multiple expansion cohorts will be set up according to different tumor types, and about 15-20 patients will be enrolled in each cohort to further observe the anti-tumor effect of Tazemetostat combined with HMPL-689 in different pathological types of R/R lymphoma.

This study is expected to enroll 85-140 patients total in Phase IIa and phase IIb.
