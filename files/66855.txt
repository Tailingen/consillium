Safety Study of IHL-305 (Irinotecan Liposome Injection) to Treat Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to determine whether IHL-305 (irinotecan liposome injection) is safe and effective in the treatment of advanced solid tumors.
Cancer
DRUG: IHL-305 (irinotecan liposome injection)
Incidence of dose-limiting toxicity within 28 days of treatment administration for patients with UGT1A1*28 genotype (wt/wt and wt/*28)|determination of maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose for patients with UGT1A1*28 genotype (wt/wt and wt/*28)
Tumor shrinkage per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) every 8 weeks/2 cycles while receiving study drug for patients with UGT1A1*28 genotype (wt/wt and wt/*28)|limited pharmacokinetics (PK) for patients with UGT1A1*28 genotype (wt/wt and wt/*28)|limited incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) and PK for UGT1A1 homozygous (*28/*28) patients
This is a Phase I dose-escalation study of intravenous administration of IHL-305 in patients with advanced solid tumors. Patients will receive IHL-305 as an intravenous infusion over 60 minutes on Day 1 followed by a 27-day observation period for a total of 28 days (4 weeks) per cycle. Two patient populations will be evaluated separately; patients with UGT1A1\*28 genotype homozygous wild-type (wt/wt) and heterozygous (wt/\*28) variants as one group, and patients with UGT1A1\*28 homozygous variant (\*28/\*28) as another group.
