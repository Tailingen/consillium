Automated Breast Ultrasound Case Collection Registry
The contribution of automated breast ultrasound (ABUS) to the screening pathway for breast cancer is not fully understood. This prospective study aims to collect longitudinal data in women with dense breasts undergoing ABUS as a supplement to digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT). The data are intended for use in future research on the value and effectiveness of ABUS in routine clinical care.

Data will be collected from eligible women who have been prescribed or have completed DBT and ABUS, screening within a 30-day window. Radiologist evaluations and, when performed, outcomes of biopsy and/or laboratory testing will be recorded. Subjects will be followed for breast cancer status and results of any diagnostic breast exams and/or treatment.
