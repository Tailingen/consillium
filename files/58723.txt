Pilot Study on the Effect of Intrathecal Opioids on Immune Function in Humans With Cancer Pain
The purpose of this study is to examine the changes in immune function, as measured by biomarkers in the blood, that happen with intrathecal (spinal) delivery of opioid medications for the treatment of moderate to severe cancer pain.

Hypothesis: Treatment of pain with intrathecal (spinal) therapy is associated with little alteration of immune function as measured by biomarkers in the blood of cancer patients with moderate to severe pain.
Cancer-associated Pain
DEVICE: Intrathecal Pump Placement
Change in biomarker values, Change in biomarker values as measured by blood, Before, 4 weeks after and 8 weeks after intrathecal pump placement
Change in Quality of Life as measured by a Brief Pain Inventory, Quality of life surveys as measured by a Brief Pain Inventory questionnaire, Before, 4 weeks after and 8 weeks after intrathecal pump placement|Change in Quality of Life as measured by MD Anderson Symptom Inventory, Quality of life surveys as measured by MD Anderson Symptom Inventory questionnaire, Before, 4 weeks after and 8 weeks after intrathecal pump placement|Serum Opioid Levels, Serum Opioid Levels, Before, 4 weeks after and 8 weeks after intrathecal pump placement
Biomarkers of immune function will be measured before and after patients receive an intrathecal pain pump for management of cancer pain.
