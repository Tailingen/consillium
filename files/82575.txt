* The Grocery List Test- Immediate recall (Word List Learning Test-Immediate recall)
* Trail Making Test Part A and B
* Digit Symbol Coding Test
* Digit Span Forward and Backward

The NPI-12 total score is calculated by adding the scores of the domains (each domain score ranges from 0 to 12). The NPI-12 total score is based upon the first 10 items and ranges from (0 to 10) with higher scores indicating greater behavioral impairment., Week 55 in the OLE Study|To evaluate the change Change from Baseline on the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living (ADCS- MCI- ADL), Change from Baseline in the double-blind study (for those on XPro1595 during the double-blind study) or Change from Baseline in the OLE Study (for those on placebo during the double-blind study) to Week 55 in the OLE study on the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living (ADCS- MCI- ADL)

The 23-item Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study - Mild Cognitive Impairment Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-MCI-ADL) Scale has good test-retest reliability, will be utilized to assess performance functioning in MCI patients (Galasko et al., 1997; Douglas Galasko et al., 2006; Pedrosa et al., 2010)., Week 55 in the OLE Study|To evaluate the change on blood inflammatory and neurodegeneration biomarkers following open-label administration of XPro1595 (on blood inflammatory and neurodegeneration biomarker amyloid), Change from Baseline in the double-blind study (for those on XPro1595 during the double-blind study or for those in the PK Lead-In Study) or Change from Baseline in the OLE Study (for those on placebo during the double-blind study) to Weeks 55, or 74 in the OLE study on blood inflammatory and neurodegeneration biomarkers (on blood inflammatory and neurodegeneration biomarker amyloid)., Weeks 55, or 74 in the OLE Study|To evaluate the change on blood inflammatory and neurodegeneration biomarkers following open-label administration of XPro1595 (on blood inflammatory and neurodegeneration biomarker pTau), Change from Baseline in the double-blind study (for those on XPro1595 during the double-blind study or for those in the PK Lead-In Study) or Change from Baseline in the OLE Study (for those on placebo during the double-blind study) to Weeks 55, or 74 in the OLE study on blood inflammatory and neurodegeneration biomarkers (on blood inflammatory and neurodegeneration biomarker pTau)., Weeks 55, or 74 in the OLE Study|To evaluate the change on imaging neuroinflammation following open-label administration of XPro1595, Change from Baseline in the double-blind study (for those on XPro1595 during the double-blind study or for those in the PK Lead-In Study) or Change from Baseline in the OLE Study (for those on placebo during the double-blind study) to Weeks 55, or 74 in the OLE study in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) neuroinflammation (White matter Free Water)., Weeks 55, or 74 in the OLE Study|To evaluate the change on axonal integrity following open-label administration of XPro1595, Change from Baseline in the double-blind study (for those on XPro1595 during the double-blind study or for those in the PK Lead-In Study) or Change from Baseline in the OLE Study (for those on placebo during the double-blind study) to Weeks 55, or 74 or in the OLE study in MRI Apparent Fiber Density (AFD)., Weeks 55, or 74 in the OLE Study|To evaluate the change in Everyday Cognition (ECog) following open-label administration of XPro1595, Change from Baseline in the double-blind study (for those on XPro1595 during the double-blind study) or Change from Baseline in the OLE Study (for those on placebo during the double-blind study) to Week 55 in the OLE study on Everyday Cognition (ECog)., Week 55 in the OLE Study
This study is designed as a Phase 2, open label study investigating the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of XPro1595 in patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The planned dose is 1.0 mg/kg of XPro1595 for all subjects that completed a previous Phase 1 or Phase 2 study with XPro1595.

Each enrolled patient will be treated with 1.0 mg/kg of XPro1595 as a subcutaneous injection once a week for 55 or 74 weeks, for a total exposure to XPro1595 of up to 78 weeks (18 months), depending on their previous study. Blood sampling for clinical lab analyses, physical exam findings, ECG and C-SSRS will be collected throughout the study to assess the safety and tolerability of XPro1595. Imaging endpoints (MRI), blood sampling for neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative biomarkers, clinical ratings (CDR-SB, ADCS-MCI ADL, NPI-12) and cognitive performance assessed via the EMACC will be collected at screening and at Weeks 12, 24, 36, and 48. Depending on the parent study, some or all of these assessments may also be made at Weeks 55, 60 or 74.

All patients that completed 4 weeks of dosing and the week 5 PK draw in the Phase 1 PK Lead-In or completed the treatment period and End of Study (EOS) assessments in a Phase 2 study are eligible to enroll into the OLE study. All patients enrolled, including those treated with placebo in the parent study, will receive 1.0 mg/kg XPro1595. Randomized treatment will remain blinded until the parent study database is locked, the study is unblinded and results for their prior study are released.
