Vascularity Impact on the Treatment Outcome in Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma(VITMPM)
The purpose of this study is to To assess the correlation between the predictive factor of vascularity (CD74) in malignant pleural mesothelioma and treatment results (response rate, and overall survival) .
Malignant Pleural Mesotheliomas
OTHER: marker CD74 and vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF
to correlate the results of the vascularity marker of pleural mesothelioma CD74 of patients attended to Ain Shams University hospitals with the result response of treatment by chemotherapy ,overall survival and progreeion free survival, The cases diagnosed and receive at the least 2-3 cycles of chemotherapy and evaluated after treatment, 3-4 months
assessment of vascular enothelial growth factor (VEGF) in patient with malignant pleural mesothelioma who attended to Ain Shams University and made comparison with the result of CD 74, The cases diagnosed and receive at the least 2-3 cycles of chemotherapy and evaluated after treatment, 3-4 months
This is a randomized controlled retrospective study through Examination of paraffin blocks of the patient selected to be included in the study for assessment of the selected vascularity marker of malignant pleural mesothelioma of both types . The CD74 (LN2) antibody is intended for qualified laboratories to qualitatively identify by light microscopy the presence of associated antigens in sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections using Immunohistochemistry test methods.
