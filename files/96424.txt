Promoting CT Engagement for Pancreatic Cancer With App
To develop a culturally tailored informational mobile application and test whether it will increase participation among Black pancreatic cancer subjects in clinical trial discussions with their care team.

This project aims to identify and address barriers to enrollment of Black subjects in pancreatic cancer clinical trials using a culturally informed mobile health application to promote participation.

The clinical trial education and communication needs of Black people with pancreatic cancer will be determined. A new mHealth application for clinical trial education and communication tailored to subject needs will be developed. It was hypothesized that a culturally tailored informational mobile application will increase the participation of Black subjects in clinical trial discussions with their care team among the target population.

This study focuses on Black pancreatic cancer subjects, who experience higher mortality rates and lower clinical trial participation than White subjects. Research shows that the disparity between clinical trial participation is in part due to inequitable recruitment practices. This study will use mobile application technology (mHealth app) as an educational, communication, audit, and feedback tool to promote patient-initiated clinical trial discussions among Black people with pancreatic cancer and their cancer care team.
