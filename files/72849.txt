Safety Study of Recombinant Vaccinia Virus Administered Intravenously in Patients With Metastatic, Refractory Colorectal Carcinoma
The purpose of this pilot safety study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of JX-594 (Pexa-Vec) administered intravenously every 2 weeks in colorectal carcinoma patients who are refractory to or intolerant of oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and Erbitux treatments.
Carcinoma, Colorectal
DRUG: Recombinant Vaccinia GM-CSF; RAC VAC GM-CSF (JX-594)
Determine the maximally-tolerated dose (MTD) and/or maximum-feasible dose (MFD) of JX-594 administered by biweekly intravenous (IV) infusion, Any of the following treatment related adverse events: Grade 4 toxicity, Grade 3 hematologic toxicity for \> 5 days, Grade 3 non-hematologic toxicities persisting for \> 7 days except for flu-like symptoms that respond to standard therapies., DLT evaluations through 14 days following last JX-594 treatment|Determine the safety of JX-594 administered by biweekly IV infusion, Adverse events will be collected and assessed to assess safety and tolerability through 28 days after last dose of JX-594 (or until all events considered probably or possibly related to JX-594 have resolved, stabilized, or returned to baseline status)., Safety evaluations through 28 days after last dose of JX-594
Determine the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and immune response activity of JX-594, Change over time in viral genomes, infectious units, GM-CSF concentration, peripheral white blood cell counts, plasma cytokine measurements, and neutralizing antibodies to JX-594 in blood and/or serum., Blood samples collected at assigned time points from baseline through Week 8|Determine the anti-tumoral response of JX-594, Tumor response (Stable, partial, complete, progression) by standard RECIST on CT/MRI. Decrease in tumor blood marker., Disease control and response assessment at Week 8
The purpose of this pilot safety study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of JX-594 (Pexa-Vec) administered intravenously every 2 weeks in colorectal carcinoma patients who are refractory to or intolerant of oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and Erbitux treatments.
