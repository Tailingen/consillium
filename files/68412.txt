Study Comparing Tarlatamab and Durvalumab Versus Durvalumab Alone in First-Line Extensive-Stage Small-Cell Lung Cancer (ES-SCLC) Following Platinum, Etoposide and Durvalumab
The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of tarlatamab plus durvalumab with durvalumab alone on prolonging overall survival (OS).
