This is a Phase 1/2, multicenter study with an open-label dose escalation followed by a randomized placebo controlled and double-blind phase of SLN124 in adult patients with Polycythemia Vera (PV) to assess the safety, tolerability, efficacy, pharmacokinetic (PK), and Pharmacodynamic (PD) response of SLN124.
