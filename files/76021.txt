Clinical Validation of ColonAiQ (a Blood-based Assay Targeting ctDNA Methylation) for Colorectal Cancer Detection
The DNA methylation targets in preoperative plasma samples of the subjects will be detected by the multi-gene methylation test (ColonAiQ), and the test accuracy will be evaluated by compared with the clinical diagnosis evidence.
Colorectal Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: ColonAiQ test and Colonoscopy
Sensitivity for colorectal cancer with ColonAiQ test, The proportion of participants with colorectal cancer who have positive test results, Up to 32 months|Specificity for colorectal cancer with ColonAiQ test, The proportion of negative test results among participants without CRC and other diseases, Up to 32 months
PPV for colorectal cancer with ColonAiQ test, Positive Predictive Value: the proportion of positive test participants who are colorectal cancer patients., Up to 32 months|NPV for colorectal cancer with ColonAiQ test, Negative Predictive Value: the proportion of negative test participants who have no disease checked by colonoscopy., Up to 32 months
The accuracy of ColonAiQ test in clinical testing will be evaluated in the multicenter, prospective study. Patients with colorectal cancer, intestinal polyps, adenomas and other non-neoplastic diseases of the digestive system, and patients with non-colorectal cancer such as gastric cancer, esophageal cancer, breast cancer and lung cancer will be enrolled. In this study, all cfDNA will be tested by fluorescence quantitative PCR, and some samples will be tested by NGS to verify the effectiveness of ColonAiQ test. Clinical diagnosis reports and methylation test results will be blinded to the lab tester and clinician respectively.
