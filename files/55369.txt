To Determine an Effective Dose of VERU-100 for the Treatment of Advanced Prostate Cancer
To determine an effective dose of VERU-100 for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer by assessing its effect on testosterone levels by Day 28 and maintenance through Day 91.
Advanced Prostate Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: VERU-100
Percent of men with total testosterone at <50 ng/dL by day 28, Percent of men that reach castrate level (\<50 ng/dL) of total testosterone levels by Day 28, Day 28
Total testosterone below 20ng/dL levels on VERU-100, Percent of men that reach \<20 ng/dL of total testosterone levels by Day 28 that are maintained at \<20 ng/dL through Day 91, Day 28 and Day 91
This study is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, dose finding study of VERU-100 to attain and maintain serum total testosterone levels within castrate range (\<50ng/dL) in men with advanced prostate cancer. Stage 1 of the study will assess the effect of VERU-100 at various doses. Stage 2 will further assess the efficacy of the effective doses of VERU-100 in an expanded patient population.
