The Aim is to Identify Recurrent Genomic Mutations and/or Predisposing Polymorphisms in Patients With Sporadic Cases of Multiple Myeloma
There is a growing body of data suggesting that the the risk of developing multiple myeloma, or myelomagenesis, is associated with genetic alterations occurring in the tumor cells. A limited number of candidate genes and polymorphisms have been reported in patients with this disease. In this study the investigators will compare the genetic information obtained on purified abnormal plasmocytes obtained from patients with multiple myeloma with available public databases in an effort to identify and if possible validate the role of certain mutations and/or polymorphisms in myelomagenesis. Plasmocytes will be obtained by immunomagnetic enrichment using CD138+ beads.
