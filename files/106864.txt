This trial has been designed as an international multicenter open-label Phase II trial.

The trial aims to investigate the efficacy, pharmacokinetics, safety, and immunogenicity of two dosage regimens of BCD-100 (JSC BIOCAD, Russia) as monotherapy in patients with unresectable/metastatic melanoma.

According to the design, the trial will include two arms of patients. Each of the trial arms will receive repeated doses of the test drug as monotherapy; BCD-100 will be administered using one of the following dosage regimens established in a Phase I trial:

* Monotherapy, BCD-100 1 mg/kg Q2W (IV infusion over 60 minutes; if a 60-minute infusion is tolerated well, all following doses can be administered over 30 minutes);
* Monotherapy, BCD-100 3 mg/kg Q3W (IV infusion over 60 minutes; if a 60-minute infusion is tolerated well, all following doses can be administered over 30 minutes).
