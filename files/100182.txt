A Phase III Study With THIO + Cemiplimab vs Chemotherapy as 3rd Line Treatment in Advanced/Metastatic NSCLC
THIO is a first-in-class small molecule telomere targeting agent, in development for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in combination with cemiplimab (LIBTAYO®). THIO is preferentially incorporated into telomeres sequence in telomerase-positive cells leading to rapid telomere uncapping, genomic instability, and cell death.

Cemiplimab is a programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitor recently approved as a first-line treatment for patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with 50% or more PD-L1 expression. It is hypothesized that THIO administration prior to cemiplimab would restore tumor responses to immunotherapy in subjects who either developed resistance or relapsed after receiving first line treatment with an immune check point inhibitor.
