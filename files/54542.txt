A Phase III Study of SKB264 for EGFR Mutant NSCLC Patients
This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter Phase 3 clinical study to evaluate SKB264 monotherapy versus pemetrexed in combination with platinum in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC with EGFR mutation who have failed to EGFR-TKI therapy.

This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter Phase 3 clinical study to evaluate SKB264 monotherapy versus pemetrexed in combination with platinum in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC with EGFR mutation who have failed to EGFR-TKI therapy. The primary objective is to compare the efficacy and safety of SKB264 monotherapy versus pemetrexed in combination with platinum in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC with EGFR mutation who have failed to EGFR-TKI therapy.
