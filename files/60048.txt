The Efficacy and Safety of Sintilimab in Combination With Multimodal Radiotherapy in Patients With Recurrent or Metastatic Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is the most common malignant tumor of head and neck in southern China. After standard treatment, about 20% of the patients had local recurrence or distant metastasis, and the patients faced death in a short time. Currently, there is no recommended treatment for patients with recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma who have unsatisfactory results of first-line chemotherapy and subsequent immunotherapy. Patients who have failed multiline therapy have a low survival rate and no drugs are available.This project aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sintilimab in combination with multimodal radiotherapy for patients with recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma who have previously received immunotherapy and still progress after multiline therapy, and to seek a new therapeutic approach for such patients.
