Role of BMP Pathway in MDS Progression
Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are hematological cancers that can progress to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). The involvement of the microenvironment in the maintenance, resistance and evolution of MDS is increasingly described.

The Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) pathway is involved in numerous functions, including self-renewal of the hematopoietic stem cell compartment and the regulation of hematopoiesis, via interaction with bone marrow stromal cells. Investigators have demonstrated its involvement in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and AML, in particular via the activation of TWIST1, ΔNp73, NANOG; it is responsible for an increased state of quiescence of certain cancer stem cells and their resistance.

Preliminary results based on the analysis of large databases suggest that the BMP pathway is also altered early in MDS. This study explores the alteration of this pathway in MDS and its involvement in the transformation into AML.

If appropriate, the BMP pathway could constitute a very promising therapeutic target to combat transformation into AML.
