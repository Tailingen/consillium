Study of ACTR707 in Combination With Rituximab in Subjects With Relapsed or Refractory B Cell Lymphoma
This is a phase 1, multi-center, single-arm, open-label study evaluating the safety and anti-lymphoma activity of an autologous T cell product (ACTR707) in combination with rituximab in subjects with refractory or relapsed CD20+ B cell lymphoma.
