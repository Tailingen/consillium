The Circulating Cell-free Genome Atlas Study
GRAIL is using deep sequencing of circulating cell-free nucleic acids (cfNAs) to develop assays to detect cancer early in blood. The purpose of this study is to collect biological samples from participants with a new diagnosis of cancer (blood and tumor tissue) and from participants who do not have a diagnosis of cancer (blood) in order to characterize the population heterogeneity in cancer and non-cancer participants and to develop models for distinguishing cancer from non-cancer.

To collect and study clinically-annotated biospecimens, specifically peripheral blood and contemporary tumor tissue when available, to characterize cfNA profiles from deep sequencing and to estimate the population heterogeneity in two arms of the study., 30 months|To develop and evaluate models for discriminating cancer versus non-cancer and tissue of origin., 30 months|To evaluate concordance of variants identified in sequencing of tumor tissue and cfNA sequencing results in plasma from the same subject., 30 months
To explore the relationship between genomic results and clinical outcomes based on collection of longitudinal information (at least annually for up to 5 years) from medical records for all consenting participants., Year 1, 2, 3, 4, 5|To enable assessment of the performance of an analytically validated clinical laboratory version of the NGS assay (under development) to detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in plasma., Year 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
This is a prospective, multi-center, observational study with collection of de-identified biospecimens and clinical data from at least 15,000 participants from clinical networks in the United States and Canada. The study will enroll approximately 10,500 cancer participants (CANCER arm) and approximately 4,500 representative participants without a clinical diagnosis of cancer (NON-CANCER arm). Clinical information, demographics, and medical data relevant to cancer status are collected from all participants and their medical record at baseline (time of biospecimen collection), and subsequently from the medical record at intermittent future time points, at least annually for up to 5 years.
