Effect of a Low Glycemic Index Diet on Breast Density
This study is a Pilot Phase II cancer intervention trial of a low glycemic index diet to reduce mammographic density in women at high risk for breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Low Glycemic Diet
Diet Change, To Assess the feasibility of a randomized trial to achieve diet change and promote longterm adoption of a low glycemic index diet intervention among women at high risk for breast cancer (\> 50% of breast area occupied by radiological density), 2 years
Biomarkers, To estimate the effect of a low glycemic index diet on breast cancer related biomarkers, including those associated with carbohydrate, growth and steroid hormaone metabolism and mammograhic density. Result from this aim will provide important preliminary data for use in planning a larger clinical trial., 4, 8 & 12 months on Treatment
