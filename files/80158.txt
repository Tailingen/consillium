Brentuximab Vedotin + Rituximab as Frontline Therapy for Pts w/ CD30+ and/or EBV+ Lymphomas
The purpose of this study is to evaluate how safe and effective the combination of two different drugs (brentuximab vedotin and rituximab) is in patients with certain types of lymphoma. This study is for patients who have a type of lymphoma that expresses a tumor marker called CD30 and/or a type that is associated with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV-related lymphoma) and who have not yet received any treatment for their cancer, except for dose-reduction or discontinuation (stoppage) of medications used to prevent rejection of transplanted organs (for those patients who have undergone transplantation). This study is investigating the combination of brentuximab vedotin and rituximab as a first treatment for lymphoma patients

For Phase I: The Recommended Phase 2 Dose of Brentuximab Vedotin in Combination With Rituximab., To identify the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D)/maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of brentuximab vedotin in combination with rituximab. The dose limiting toxicity monitoring period for brentuximab vedotin and rituximab is first 21 days (during induction).The RP2D/MTD will be defined as the highest dose of brentuximab vedotin that causes dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) in \<2 of 6 patients. The Phase I portion of the study follows a 3+3 design. Brentuximab has two dose levels: Level 1 (starting dose) 1.2 mg/kg IV, and Level -1 (de-escalation dose): 0.8 mg/kg IV. Toxicity will be assessed using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.03., The first 21 days of Induction|Phase 1: Number of Dose Limiting Toxicities of Brentuximab Vedotin and Rituximab in Patients With Immunosuppressed Lymphoid Malignancies., Dose limiting toxicities (DLT) will be monitored for Phase 1 patients for the first 21 days of Induction (the DLT monitoring period) to evaluate safety. In general, a non-hematologic DLT is defined as any Grade ≥ 3 toxicity, and a hematologic DLT is defined as any Grade ≥ 4 toxicity, both by CTCAE v4.03 criteria., The first 21 days of induction|Phase II: Percent of Participants With an Overall Response, Overall response will be defined as the detection of Partial Response (PR) or Complete Response (CR) by CT or PET/CT, and/or resolution of marrow-only involvement. Response will be assessed according to the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson, et al). CR is defined as a complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and disease-related symptoms, if present before therapy. A post-treatment residual mass of any size is permitted as long as it is PET negative. If a pretreatment PET scan was negative, all lymph nodes and nodal masses must have regressed on CT to normal size. A PR is defined as At least a 50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters of up to six of the largest dominant nodes or nodal masses. No increase should be observed in the size of other nodes, liver, or spleen., Every 12 weeks for up to 1 year on treatment (Range of cycles attempted from induction, +/- consolidation, + maintenance = 1-17 cycles) Induction = 4 weeks, consolidation = 4 weeks, 1 maintenance cycle = 3 weeks
Number of Participants With Adverse Events Possibly Related to Study Drug Graded 3, 4, and 5, Toxicity, both frequency and severity, will continue to be measured by monitoring the occurrence of adverse events. Adverse events will be defined as those included in CTCAE v 4.03. AEs that were determined to be at least possibly related to study drug and graded 3, 4, 5 are included here. Grade 1 (mild): the event causes discomfort without disruption of normal daily activities. Grade 2 (moderate): the event causes discomfort that affects normal daily activities. Grade 3 (severe): the event makes the patient unable to perform normal daily activities or significantly affects his/her clinical status. Grade 4 (Life-threatening): the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event. Grade 5 (fatal): the event caused death., From time of treatment to 30 days post discontinuation (range of cycles attempted from induction +/- consolidation, & maintenance = 1-17 cycles) About 1 year Induction = 4 weeks, consolidation = 4 weeks, 1 maintenance cycle = 3 weeks|Percentage of Participants Without Progression (Progression Free Survival (PFS)), Study treatment efficacy will be evaluated using PET or CT scan images to determine Progression Free Survival (PFS). PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression. Response criteria will be those specified by Cheson, et al as the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma. Progressive Disease (PD) is defined as the appearance of any new lesion more than 1.5 cm in any axis during or at the end of therapy, even if other lesions are decreasing in size, or at least a 50% increase from nadir in the diameter of any previously involved nodes, or in a single involved node, or the size of other lesions. All patients who have had at least one dose of study treatment will be evaluable for PFS with censoring of patients who are lost to follow-up. PFS will be reported as percentage of participants without progression., start of treatment to time of progression (up to 2 years after treatment discontinuation)|Percentage of Participants Alive at 2 Years (Overall Survival), Overall survival (OS) will be measured from treatment initiation until death from any cause for up to 1 year post-treatment discontinuation. Overall survival is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of death. All patients who have had at least one dose of study treatment will be evaluable for OS. OS will be reported as percentage of participants alive at 2 years post treatment discontinuation, with censoring of patients who are lost to follow-up., From start of treatment to 2 years post treatment discontinuation|Number of Participants With Best Overall Response (BOR), The best overall response (BOR) is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence. Best response assessed by CT or PET/CT according to the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson et. al). Responses include Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), and Stable Disease (SD). CR: Complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and disease-related symptoms, if present before therapy. If a pretreatment PET scan was negative, all lymph nodes and nodal masses must have regressed on CT to normal size. PR: At least a 50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters of up to six of the largest dominant nodes or nodal masses. No increase should be observed in the size of other nodes, liver, or spleen. SD: neither CR or PR, or progressive disease (PD). PD: Appearance of new lesion \> 1.5 cm in any axis, or at least a 50% increase from nadir in the diameter of any previously involved nodes., Every 12 weeks for up to 1 year on treatment (Range of cycles attempted from induction, +/- consolidation, + maintenance = 1-17 cycles) Induction = 4 weeks, consolidation = 4 weeks, 1 maintenance cycle = 3 weeks|Number of Participants With Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) Activation and Number of Participants Without EBV Activation, EBV activation will be evaluated in all patients who receive at least one dose of study treatment and have an evaluable tissue microarray (TMA) collected at baseline. EBV activation and proliferation will be measured by viral loads from blood collections as measured at time of enrollment and monthly thereafter in all enrolled patients, until completion of study therapy. Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) quantitative PCR is used to an aid in monitoring EBV-related disease. Lab thresholds vary at sites however, labs results are considered either "negative" or "abnormal". Number of participants who experienced EBV activation, i.e an abnormal lab result (YES) and patients who did not experience EBV activation, i.e. a negative lab result (NO) will be reported., Time from start of study treatment to last dose of study drug (Range of cycles attempted from induction, +/- consolidation, + maintenance = 1-17 cycles, up to 1 year) Induction = 4 weeks, consolidation = 4 weeks, 1 maintenance cycle = 3 weeks|Time to Initiation of Cytotoxic Chemotherapy, Time to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy will be defined as the time elapsed between study treatment initiation, and time of first non-targeted cytotoxic chemotherapy (off study treatment). Time to cytotoxic chemotherapy will be evaluated in all patients who receive at least one dose of study treatment., Up to 3 years from treatment discontinuation|Number of Participants With Graft Rejection vs Without Graft Rejection, Graft rejection will be defined as any of the following: documentation of new or progressive rejection by tissue biopsy of the graft; re-transplantation due to graft rejection; clinical diagnosis of new or progressive graft rejection, since start of treatment on protocol, as given by the patient's transplant physician. Escalation of intensity of immunosuppression will not, by itself, be considered evidence of graft rejection. Note: patients with clinically active graft rejection will not be excluded from trial enrollment, but will not be considered to have treatment emergent graft rejection unless progression of rejection is documented. Rates of graft rejection will be evaluated in all patients who receive at least one dose of study treatment., From start of treatment to 3 years post treatment discontinuation
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate the safety of brentuximab vedotin and rituximab in patients with lymphoid malignancies that are cluster of differentiation (CD) 30 positive (+) and/or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)+, and to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the combination. (Phase I) II. To evaluate the efficacy, as measured by response rates, of brentuximab vedotin and rituximab in patients with lymphoid malignancies that are CD30+ and/or EBV+. (Phase II)

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To further evaluate the frequency and severity of toxicity. (Phase II) II. To further evaluate the clinical efficacy of the combination of brentuximab vedotin and rituximab, as measured by progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) at one year after the end of treatment. (Phase II) III. To determine the effects of the combination of brentuximab vedotin and rituximab on markers of EBV activation and proliferation. (Phase II) IV. Further evaluate efficacy as measured by time to cytotoxic chemotherapy. (Phase II) V. Further evaluate efficacy as measured by observed rates of graft rejection. (Phase II)

TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine whether and to what extent CD30 expression predicts for response and outcome.

II. To determine whether and to what extent expression of EBV markers predicts for response and outcome.

III. To determine whether changes in serum levels of EBV correlate with response and subsequent loss of response to therapy.

OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of brentuximab vedotin followed by a phase II study.

INDUCTION: Patients receive brentuximab vedotin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes once weekly for 3 weeks and rituximab IV once weekly for 4 weeks. Patients unable to achieve complete remission (CR) may receive additional optional consolidation therapy identical to induction therapy.

MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients receive brentuximab vedotin IV once every 3 weeks and rituximab IV once every 6 weeks. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 2 years.
