FACBC PET/CT for Recurrent Prostate Cancer
Hypothesis:Anti-\[18F\]FACBC PET-CT will adequately detect local and extraprostatic recurrence, and lead to better characterization of disease status in restaging patients.

This is a study that will test a compound (chemical substance) that has a small amount of radioactivity attached to it. This substance has a natural tendency to go to prostate tissue. The substance is called \[18\]FACBC and it is given in the form of an injection into a vein. After the substance reaches the prostate, scans called PET or Positron Emission Tomography, are done. This is similar to having CAT scans or x-rays. Usually a compound called \[18\]FDG is used for PET scans but this substance is eliminated by the kidneys and cannot reach the prostate. This substance called \[18\]FACBC is not eliminated by the kidneys and may allow tumors in the prostate to be seen better. It is sometimes difficult to tell if a growth on the prostate is cancer with scans or x-rays that are usually done.

Anti-\[18F\]FACBC PET-CT will be compared to ProstaScint (In-capromab pendetide) which is the conventional imaging for prostate cancer. Investigators will be blinded of the intervention.

This study will look at how the \[18\]FACBC goes into the prostate tissue and determine its ability to detect recurrent prostate cancer.
