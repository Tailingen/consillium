AZD0486 as Monotherapy in B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia
This is a Phase 1/2, global multicentre, open-label, single-arm, dose escalation and dose optimisation study of AZD0486 to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of AZD0486 monotherapy in participants with R/R B ALL who have received â‰¥ 2 prior lines of therapies. The study will consist of 3 parts. Part A monotherapy dose escalation. Part B dose optimisation. Part C Dose expansion at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D)
B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (B-ALL)
DRUG: AZD0486
Part A: Frequency of DLTs, DLTs are dose-limiting toxicities as defined in the study protocol, 28 days|Parts A & B: Safety Evaluation of AZD0486, Frequency, severity, and relationship to study drug of AEs and SAEs; dose modifications; changes in laboratory evaluations; QTc, and vital signs changes., From signing of informed consent through completion of study treatment, an average of 6 months|Parts B & C: Overall Response Rate (ORR), The Primary analysis for ORR be conducted in RP2D-treated participants (in Part B and C)., From First dose to end of treatment or data cutoff, whichever comes first, assessed up to 24 months
Part A: Objective Response Rate (ORR), Overall response rate (ORR) is defined as proportion of participants who achieve overall response (CR/CRi)., From First dose to end of treatment or data cutoff, whichever comes first, assessed up to 12 months|Parts A, B, C: Duration of response (DoR), Date of first documented CR/CRi until the date of relapse or death, Up to 36 months|Parts A, B, C: CR rate at any time during the study, CR rate as defined as the percentage of participants achieving CR at any time by NCCN criteria, From first dose until end of study, up to 36 months|Parts A, B, C: Event-free survival (EFS), Event-free survival is defined as the time from the date of the first dose until the date of a relapse after achieving a CR/ CRi, or death due to any cause., From first dose until end of study, up to 36 months|Parts A, B, C: Overall survival (OS), OS measured from first dose of study drug until death, From first dose until end of study, up to 36 months|Parts B & C: Subsequent alloSCT or Donor Lymphocyte Infusion, Number of patients who after achieve CR/CR underwent an alloSCT or Donor Lymphocyte Infusion, From first dose until end of study, up to 24 months|Parts B &C: CR MRD-negative rate, Number of patients who achieve CR MRD-negative by NGS at any time on study, First dose until end of study, up to 24 months|Parts A, B, & C: PK characterization of AZD0486, Derived PK parameter: AUC, From first dose until end of study, up to 36 months|Parts A, B & C: PK Characterization of AZD0486, Derived PK parameter: Cmax, From first dose until end of study, up to 36 months|Parts A, B, C: PK Characterization of AZD0486, Derived PK Parameter: tmax, From first dose until end of study, up to 36 months|Parts A, B, C: PK Characterization of AZD0486, Derived PK parameter: Ctrough, From first dose until end of study, up to 36 months|Parts A, B, C: PK Characterization of AZD0486, Derived PK Parameter: t1/2, Pre-defined intervals from day 1 to day 28|Parts A, B, C: PK Characterization of AZD0486, Derived PK Parameter: CL of AZD0486, From first dose until end of study, up to 36 months|Parts A, B, C: ADA characterization of AZD0486, Summary of pre-existing and treatment-induced ADAs for AZD0486 (positive or negative, titres), Consent until 36 months after first dose|Part C: Safety Evaluation of AZD0486, Frequency, severity, and relationship to study drug of AEs and SAEs; dose modifications; changes in laboratory evaluations; QTc, and vital signs changes., From signing of informed consent through completion of study treatment, an average of 6 months
This dose escalation and optimization study is evaluating the safety, tolerability, PK, PD and clinical activity of AZD0486 monotherapy in r/r B-ALL.
