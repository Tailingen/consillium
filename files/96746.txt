Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of ACTIQ in Patients With Cancer and Breakthrough Pain
The primary objective of the study is to determine whether a test titration regimen of ACTIQ treatment will reduce the number of inadequately managed episodes of breakthrough pain for an individual patient by attaining a successful dose of ACTIQ treatment more quickly. The successful ACTIQ dose provides a satisfactory combination of efficacy and tolerability after a single administration, as assessed by the patient.
