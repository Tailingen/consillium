A Phase Ⅱ Trial of Neoadjuvant Toripalimab Plus Platinum-doublet Chemotherapy in Locally Advanced NSCLC.
This is a Phase 2, prospective, single-arm, open-Label, single-center study that to find out (1)The effectiveness and safety of toripalimab combined with platinum-doublet chemotherapy as a preoperative neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced (stage IIB, IIIA, and resectable stage IIIB) NSCLC, (2)The best treatment time for this combination of neoadjuvant therapy before surgery, (3)The effectiveness and safety of combination of neoadjuvant therapy as salvage neoadjuvant therapy after failure of neoadjuvant chemo-only for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer.
Locally Advanced NSCLC
DRUG: Toripalimab combination with platinum-containing dual-drug chemotherapy.
Major pathological response (MPR) rate, MPR rate is defined as the percentage of participants having ≤10% viable tumor cells in the pathological examination of resected specimens., At time of surgery
Complete pathological response (pCR) rate, pCR rate is defined as the percentage of participants having no tumor cells in the pathological examination of resected specimens., At time of surgery|R0 surgical resection rate, No residual ratio under the microscope after surgical resection, At time of surgery|Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants having a complete response or a partial response, measured by RECIST 1.1., Baseline (Prior to surgery)|Adverse Events (AEs), Incidence of all grade AE which has been confirmed to be correlated with neoadjuvant treatment., Approximately 2 years after the last patient registered.|Event-free survival(EFS), Event-free survival was defined as the time from the first treatment to any progression of disease precluding surgery, progression or recurrence of disease after surgery, progression of disease in the absence of surgery, or death from any cause, Approximately 2 years after the last patient registered.
