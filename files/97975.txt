Trial of Motexafin Gadolinium and Pemetrexed (AlimtaÂ®) for Second Line Treatment in Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
The goals of this study are:

* to determine if the combination of two drugs, motexafin gadolinium and pemetrexed, may be an effective treatment for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have had one previous chemotherapy regimen that included a platinum containing drug such as cisplatin or carboplatin.
* to assess response to treatment in patients with NSCLC six months after beginning study treatment.
