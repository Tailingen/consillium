A Study to Evaluate the Immunogenicity, Safety and Tolerability of Quadrivalent Human Papillomavirus Vaccine (V501) in Chinese Girls Aged 9-19 Years and Young Women Aged 20-26 Years (V501-213)
This study is designed to evaluate the immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability of Gardasil® (quadrivalent human papillomavirus \[qHPV\] vaccine, V501) in Chinese girls aged 9-19 years and young women aged 20-26 years. The primary hypothesis of the study states that at 1 month postdose 3, a 3-dose regimen of V501 induces non-inferior geometric mean titers (GMTs) for serum anti-HPV 6, anti-HPV 11, anti-HPV 16, anti-HPV 18 in girls aged 9-19 years compared to young women aged 20-26 years.

The study consists of a Base Stage wherein Chinese girls aged 9-19 years and young women aged 20-26 years receive a 3-dose regimen of V501 and are followed up to 1 month postdose 3 (Month 7). Participants aged 9-19 years who received 3 doses of V501 in the Base Stage will be eligible to participate in the Extension Stage and will be followed up to Month 60.
