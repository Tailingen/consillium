Cost-utility of Two Strategies of Perineal Reconstruction After Abdominoperineal Resection for Anorectal Carcinoma
Abdominoperineal resection performed for anorectal tumors leaves a large pelvic and perineal defect causing a high rate of morbidity of the perineal wound (40 - 60 %). Biological meshes offer possibility for a new standard of perineal wound reconstruction. Perineal filling with biological mesh is expected to increase quality of life by reducing perineal morbidity.
Abdominoperineal Resection
PROCEDURE: Biological mesh|PROCEDURE: Primary perineal wound closure
Incremental Cost-Utility Ratio (ICUR), The primary endpoint in this study is based on the assessment of the incremental cost-utility ratio at 1 year, from the collective perspective between biological mesh perineal reconstructions versus. primary perineal closure in patients operated for anorectal carcinoma with proven rectal adenocarcinoma or anal canal epidermoid carcinoma., At 12 months
Perineal wound healing, The perineal wound healing will be assessed using the Southampton wound assessment scale (6-point scale ranging from 0=normal healing to V=deep or severe wound infection), At 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months|Pain intensity, assessed on an 11-point Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) at baseline before surgical procedure and at least 3 times a day during hospital stay. Thereafter, patients will rate their pain intensity in a patient subject diary every day and immediately before each use of pain medication, From date of randomization until the date of study participation end of patient, assessed up to 12 months|Health related Quality of life, Health related quality of life will be assessed using the EuroQOL EQ-5D-5L questionnaire, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months|Perineal complications, Perineal complications include:

* Perineal wound infection defined as a swelling of the wound or surrounding tissues with purulent discharge
* Breakdown of the perineal wound included any wound dehiscence, sinus or ulcer
* Pelvic abscess included a fluid collection in the pelvis
* Perineal evisceration defined by exposure of the pelvic cavity through the perineal wound
* Perineal hernia symptomatic or not
* Perineal sinus defined as an incomplete healing after 6 months, Daily during hospitalization and at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after surgery
Perineal wound problems after abdominoperineal resection (APR) in the context of cancer are frequent. These types of resection problems occur because of wound complications caused by large perineal defects. Indeed, perineal wound complications, perineal abscess, wound dehiscences, chronic fistulas and sinuses lengthen the hospital stays. Futhermore, the standardization of the surgery since the late 2000s and the extralevator technique lead a larger defect and increase i perineal complications.

Several strategies are used to decrease the complication rate. Closure by direct approximation of the pelvic muscles leads to a rate of major complication up to 57% depending on the series. Musculocutaneous flaps help to reduce this rate (16- 65%) but they generate their own morbidity, require experience and increase the costs of care. Finally, the use of biologic meshes since the beginning of 2010 seems to have improve the healing process. However, results are still variable and the only randomized study comparing direct closure and mesh closure showed no significant results at one year. Another ongoing randomized trial is comparing gluteus maximus flap to mesh closure and focusing on physical performances.

This increase in post-operative complications and their consequences causes an increase in costs. In addition, they affect the patients' quality of life and lead to a loss of productivity. From an oncological point of view, perineal scarring problems can cause a delay in the adjuvant therapeutic sequence. Few studies have highlighted the efficiency of perineal wound complications, using cost-effectiveness analyses. In order to clarify the best strategy comparing primary and mesh closure in term of cost effectiveness on perineal healing after ELAPE, we designed this randomized controlled trial.
