Video Assisted Ablation of Pilonidal Sinus Versus Conventional Treatment
Video assisted ablation of pilonidal sinus (VAAPS) is a new endoscopic minimally invasive treatment. In an attempt to validate the effectiveness of the VAAPS, the investigators have designed a comparative study between the conventional and the minimally invasive treatment. Two surgical procedures were evaluated: VAAPS (Experimental group) and conventional excision with a Bascom out-midline closure (Control group).
Chronic Sacrococcygeal Pilonidal Sinus
PROCEDURE: Video assisted ablation of pilonidal sinus|PROCEDURE: Bascom Cleft lift procedure
Infection, Wound infection was defined as redness and/or oedema of the skin and/or discharge., at 30 days after surgery
recurrence, recurrence was defined when symptoms of the disease recurred after an interval following complete wound healing., at 1 year after surgery|return at work, up to 30 days after surgery|Pain, A vas-score scale (0-10) will be used, up to 30 days after surgery|satisfaction, a Vas-score scale (0-10) and a SF_36 model will be used, up to six months after surgery
