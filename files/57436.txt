MRD Monitoring by Digital Droplet PCR in the Early Period After Allo-HSCT to Predict Patients at High Risk of Relapse
A study on the Effectiveness of digital droplet PCR in monitoring measurable residual disease during the early period after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation to predict patients at high risk of relapse
Measurable Residual Disease
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Digital Droplet PCR
Cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), The time from the date of transplantation to disease recurrence:

Disease recurrence, defined as one of the following:

Leukemia blasts reappeared in peripheral blood, or blasts ≥ 5%, naive monocytes ≥ 5% in bone marrow, or extramedullary lesions., At Year 2
Relapse-free survival (RFS), The time from the date of treatment to the occurrence of any of the following:

1. Death from any cause
2. Disease recurrence, At Year 2|Non-relapse mortality (NRM), Assessment of NRM at Year 2, At Year 2|Overall survival (OS), Assessment of OS at Year 2, At Year 2
This is a retrospective and multicenter clinical study.This study is indicated for patients with hematological malignancies who underwent allo-HSCT. It aims to evaluate the effectiveness of digital droplet PCR in monitoring measurable residual disease during the early period after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation to predict patients at high risk of relapse. 192 patients will be enrolled. The clinical end points include cumulative incidence of relapse, relapse-free survival, non-relapse mortality, and overall survival.
