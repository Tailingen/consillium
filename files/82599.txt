A Non-Randomized Study of Internal Radiation Therapy to the Liver in Patients With Primary Liver Cancer for Whom Surgery is Not Possible.
Surgical resection of the affected liver offers the best chance for disease-free survival in patients with Hepatoma (HCC). Unfortunately, most hepatoma patients present with disease which is multi-focal and thus not resectable. Fewer than 15% of HCC patients are resectable. The objective of treatment with TheraSphere is to selectively administer a dose of radioactive material directly to neoplastic tissue in the liver. Systemic therapy is largely ineffective.
Liver Cancer
DEVICE: Brachytherapy
Efficacy|- Response to treatment|- Survival time from treatment|Safety:|- Adverse experience
Protocol Objectives include:

* Determine the proportion of patients with HCC in whom the treatment plan can be completed
* Evaluate the response to therapy
* Evaluate toxicities and adverse experiences associated with TheraSphere treatment
* Evaluate survival time
