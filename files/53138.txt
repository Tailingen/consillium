Neoadjuvant PD-1 Inhibitor and EGFR Inhibitor in Locally Advanced Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma
The NEOPECS trial is a phase II prospective, single-arm, non-randomised interventional trial for patients with borderline resectable locally advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma with a 6-participant safety lead in to ensure safety of the combination in the neoadjuvant setting across 3 sites in Australia.
Locally Advanced Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Cetuximab|DRUG: Cemiplimab
Preliminary activity, The primary preliminary activity endpoint will be the achievement of clinical downstaging from borderline resectable status to either resectable status or surgery avoidance due to complete metabolic response with no residual pathological disease as deemed by Multi-Disciplinary Team (MDT) consensus evaluation following up to 4 cycles of neoadjuvant therapy., 3 months
Treatment safety and feasibility as assessed by NCI CTCAE v5, Safety and feasibility by assessment of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) V5.0 with the incidence of â‰¥ Grade 3 adverse events, \< Grade 3 adverse events and SAEs and AEs leading to study treatment discontinuation., 12 months|Treatment safety and feasibility as assessed by rate of R0 resection, Safety and feasibility by assessment of change in rate of R0 resection. R0 resection is defined no residual tumour in surgically removed specimen of curative intent per local and central pathology review., 12 months|Pathological response rate, Preliminary efficacy by assessment of pathological response rate, including complete (0% residual tumour cells) and major (0-10% residual tumour cells) pathological responses, by blinded central pathology review. Complete pathological response (pCR) defined as absence of viable tumor cells in surgical specimen. Major pathological response (MPR) defined as 0-10% viable tumor cells in surgical specimen., 12 months|Overall response rate (ORR), Preliminary efficacy by assessment of overall response rate (ORR) as per Modifed Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors for immune based therapeutics (iRECIST) criteria or investigator caliper assessment where disease is un-measurable by CT or MRI modalities, 12 months|Progression free survival (PFS), Preliminary efficacy by assessment of 12-month and median PFS using the Kaplan-Meier method. PFS is defined as the interval from date of registration to the date of first evidence of disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., 12 months|Event-free survival (EFS), Preliminary efficacy by assessment of 12-month and median EFS using the Kaplan-Meier method. EFS is defined as the interval from date of registration to progressive disease or adverse events precluding surgery, inability to undergo complete (R0) resection, disease recurrence or death from any cause., 12 months|Overall survival (OS), Preliminary efficacy by assessment of 12-month and median OS using the Kaplan-Meier method. OS is defined as the interval from date of registration to date of death from any cause, or the date of last known follow-up alive., 12 months|Change in predicted difficulty of surgical resection and repair, Change in predicted difficulty of surgical resection and repair pre- and post-neoadjuvant therapy as measured with paired surgeon-rated scaling "scale for predicted operability of cutaneous SCC". Scale scores range from Inoperable disease (A) to Complete response (F), 3 months
To explore the relationship between cancer-immune cell-stroma interactions using spatial transcriptomics and single cell RNA sequencing and outcome., To explore the relationship between cancer-immune cell-stroma interactions using spatial transcriptomics and single cell RNA sequencing and outcome., 3 months|Patient reported outcomes as assessed by EORTC QLQ-C30, The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) will be utilized to assess the quality of life of cancer patients measured from 0-4 (Not at all - Very Much)., 36 months|Patient reported outcomes as assessed by FoP-Q-SF, The Fear-of-Progression Questionnaire - Short Form (FoP-Q-SF) will be utilized to assess fear of cancer progression measured from 1-5 (never - very often)., 36 months
As cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma typically occurs on sun-exposed areas of the head and neck, surgical resection of advanced disease can have significant morbidity and disfigurement and strategies to downstage disease prior to surgery, improve chance of R0 resection and reduce the risk of post-surgical relapse remain an area of need.

This study aims to determine the preliminary activity and tolerability of neo-adjuvant combination cemiplimab and cetuximab in unresectable locally advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma by clinical downstaging rate to resectable status.
