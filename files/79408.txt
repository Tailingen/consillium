MRI Evaluation of the Breast Areolar Margin and Paryenchyma
The purpose of this study is to test a new method of defining patterns of how breast glands are or are not attached to the overlying skin. All patients will have markers placed on both breasts and will undergo an MRI. MRI results will be examined to identify the pattern of breast gland attachment to the overlying skin. This will help identify patients which may benefit from areolar sparing and/or nipple sparing technique and which patients should be treated by standard mastectomy.
