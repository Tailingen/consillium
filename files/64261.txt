In Vivo Dosimetry for Brachytherapy Study
The main study aim is the investigate the clinical use of in vivo dosimeters (small measurement devices) for brachytherapy (internal radiotherapy).
Prostate Cancer|Gynaecological Cancer
To assess the feasibility of in vivo dosimetry in HDR brachytherapy and compare the calculated dose against measured dose, Measured by comparing the calculated (treatment planning system (TPS)) dose against the measured dose (using micro silica thermo-luminescent dosimeters (TLDs) and micro metal oxide field effect transistors (MOSFETS)). The measured dose will be compared to the calculated dose by the TPS at the bladder neck, anterior rectal wall, recto-vaginal point (gynaecological cases) and within the clinical target volume (CTV) for each fraction as well for the whole treatment., 12 months
Review of investigative and corrective action, Measured by defined action thresholds during high-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy, 12 months
A dosimeter is a small device that is able to record the dose of radiation received. It can provide an independent check that the dose of radiation delivered matches the dose calculated for patients receiving radiotherapy as part of their cancer treatment.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the clinical use of in vivo dosimeters for brachytherapy. Two types of dosimeters will be used; micro metal oxide field effect transistors (microMOSFETs) and Thermoluminescent detectors (TLDs). These will be placed into the rectum (back passage), urethra (the tube through which urine leave the body from the bladder) and within or near (typically within a few centimetres) to the cancer itself. These devices will record the dose of radiation received at the time of brachytherapy at each of these sites and we will compare that measurement with the expected measurement based on the calculations we made in planning the patient's treatment.
