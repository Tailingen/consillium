BIOmarker-guided Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of cemipLimab for advancEd Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma
Background - Advanced cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (mycosis fungoides, MF) is an incurable extranodal mature lymphoma with poor prognosis. Currently available therapies provide only short-term remissions.

Rationale - MF is an immunogenic cancer and expresses a high number of neoantigens. therefore it it reasonable to assume that it would respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors.

Objectives - The primary objective is to test the clinical efficacy (objective response rate) of the immune checkpoint inhibitor cemiplimab in patients with advanced mycosis fungoides (MF) who failed first-line therapy, defined as the sum of complete and partial responses (where at least 50% reduction of mSWAT is achieved).
Mycosis Fungoides
DRUG: Cemiplimab
Objective Response Rate, Efficacy of treatment will be described by an objective response rate (ORR) \>50%. I.e. achieving ORR in 50% of the patients., The analysis of the primary endpoint will occur 90 days after 16 patients complete week 27 assessments.
Assessment of Treatment Safety, CTCAE v5.0 will be used to categorize treatment related and non-treatment related adverse events., Adverse events will be reviewed throughout the study and the analysis will be completed 90 days following the 99 week follow-up.|Assessment of Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival is defined as the time between the date of treatment initiation and the date of disease progression or death, The PFS analysis will be completed 90 days following the 99 week follow-up.|Reduction in mSWAT during Therapy., Clinical investigator will assess the patches, plaques and tumors on your skin and assign a value using a grid point system. These values will be assessed in relation to the original baseline value., mSWAT will be assessed during screening, week 12, week 27, week 39 and week 48|Duration of Objective Response to Therapy, Duration of treatment response is defined as the elapsed time between demonstration of an objective response and subsequent progression of disease or censoring., The duration of objective response to therapy analysis will be completed 90 days following the 99 week follow-up.|Health Related Quality of Life (EuroQol-5D), The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking a box next to a series of questions. This decision results in a number that can be combined with the other questions to form a number that describes the patient's health state., The EuroQol-5D questionnaire will be administered at screening, Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days) and every 12 weeks (cycle 5, 9, etc. )thereafter until end of treatment (max of 17 cycles)|Health Related Quality of Life (Brief Older People's Quality of Life), The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking a box next to a series of questions. This decision results in a number that can be combined with the other questions to form a number that describes the patient's health state., The OPQOL-Brief questionnaire will be administered at screening, Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days) and every 12 weeks (cycle 5, 9, etc. )thereafter until end of treatment (max of 17 cycles)|Health Related Quality of Life (Dermatological Life Quality Index), The patient is asked to describe their skin problems by ticking a box next to a series of questions. This decision results in a number that can be combined with the other questions to form a number that describes how the patients skin problems have affected their quality of life., The DLQI questionnaire will be administered at screening, Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days) and every 12 weeks (cycle 5, 9, etc. )thereafter until end of treatment (max of 17 cycles)
