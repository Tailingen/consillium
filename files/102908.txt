Ipilimumab for Head and Neck Cancer Patients
This study is for patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). This study will test the feasibility of the administration of intratumoral injections of ipilimumab prior to surgical resection, and the immune system response to treatment.
Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck
DRUG: Intratumoral Ipilimumab
Surgery delay, The percentage of patients with surgery delayed possibly related to the study drug., 7-10 Days
Feasibility of paired tissue sample acquisition, The number of tissue samples that can be collected which were: biopsied, injected, and resected., 7-10 Days|Acceptance of study, The screening-to-enrollment ratio will be calculated., 28 Days
Failure rate of planned laboratory assays, The percentage of assays achieving a result., 7-10 days
This study will test intratumor microdosing of ipilimumab (antagonistic antibody directed to Cytotoxic T-Lmphocyte-Associated Protein 4 \[CTLA-4\]) 7-10 days prior to planned surgical resection of tumor and involved lymph nodes in patients with SCCHN. Tissue, peripheral blood, saliva and stool samples will be obtained for immunologic end points. The primary objective is to assess safety, as determined by the number of surgeries that are delayed.
