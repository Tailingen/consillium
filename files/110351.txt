The study will be done in two parts. The first part is called "escalation" and the second part is called "expansion". In both parts of the study, patients will initially be imaged with a \[68Ga\]Ga EVS459 positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) or PET/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. In the escalation part, different doses of \[177Lu\]Lu-EVS459 will then be tested to identify recommended dose(s) (RD(s)) for further evaluation. The expansion part of the study will examine the safety and preliminary efficacy of \[177Lu\]Lu-EVS459 at the RD(s) determined during the escalation part. The end of study will occur when at least 80% of the patients in the expansion part have completed the follow-up for disease progression or discontinued from the study for any reason, and all patients have completed treatment and the 36-month long-term follow-up period.
