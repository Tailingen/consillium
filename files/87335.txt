Impact of Hepatectomy on HCC Recurrence
Hepatectomy is the first option for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) at CNLC Ib stage. HCC patients who undergo curative hepatectomy may experience varying remnant liver volumes and thus leads to different oncological outcomes.

recurrence-free survival, the time from the time of radical surgery to the time of HCC recurrence, 2019.1-2023.8
Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who undergo curative hepatectomy may experience varying remnant liver volumes. The investigators aimed to evaluate whether the extent of liver resection has an effect on postoperative recurrence in HCC patients. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 197 patients who underwent hepatectomy for a solitary HCC lesion measuring â‰¥5 cm between January 2019 and June 2022. Patients were divided into major hepatectomy (MAH) group (n=70) and minor hepatectomy (MIH) group (n=127) based on the extent of liver resection. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) was compared between the two groups. Propensity score matching was employed to mitigate potential biases in this research.
