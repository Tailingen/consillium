Exercise Therapy in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC)
The goals of this clinical trial are to learn 1. Determine the feasibility of a home-based exercise analog therapy using Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS), 2. Determine the effects of exercise analog therapy on muscle mass, strength, and clinical outcomes, and 3. Determine the effects of exercise analog therapy on immune phenotype and inflammation response in patients undergoing radiation for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).

The main question it aims to answer are:

Does an exercise regimen using an analog TENS unit during the course of cancer treatment for those with HNSCC improve muscle mass, strength, clinical outcomes and immune response compared to those that do not perform the exercise regimen during their cancer treatment?

Researchers will compare outcomes of patients undergoing cancer treatment + TENS unit exercise to those being treated for their cancer with no exercise TENS unit.

In the exercise arm, subjects will use the TENS unit for 30 minutes of exercise a day, 3 times a week for the extent of their cancer treatments.

Weekly check-ins by phone or less frequently at scheduled in person visits.

Participants will keep a log of their exercise sessions to make sure that the exercise occurs 3 times a week for 30 minutes each and note any reasons why a session may have been missed or time shortened.

Both arms will have a blood draw at the beginning of their cancer treatment and approximately 4 weeks after the last cancer treatment (\~40mL). These samples will be tested for molecules that signal a higher or lower immune response with the addition of the exercise in one group compared to the cancer therapy only group.
Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma HNSCC
OTHER: Exercise
Number of Patients that complete TENS unit exercise as recommended, The documentation of successful completion of exercise with the recommended use guidelines (30min, 3 times a week for duration of cancer therapy) will determine if using this type of low maintenance analog exercise muscle stimulation is practical for use in this patient population., beginning of cancer treatment to 4 weeks after cancer treatment concludes
Body Mass Index (BMI)=Weight (kg)/Height (m)^2, Body Mass Index using Height (m) vs Weight (kg) to calculate the BMI once pre cancer treatment and once post cancer treatment/intervention. BMI=Weight (kg)/Height (m)\^2. This will identify what the effect of this analog exercise may have on the subject's BMI., Once at beginning of cancer treatment and once 4 weeks post-cancer treatment|Percent Fat/Water/Muscle Content of Body, The Fat/Water/Muscle content ratio will be measured in both the control group and the exercise group prior to beginning cancer treatment with our without exercise and then 4 weeks post-treatment using Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (a scale that a person stands on that measures body content ratios (%) of these three macromolecules). This measurement will also identify the effect of using the TENS unit analog exercise regimen on a subject's overall body composition., Once prior to cancer treatment and once 4 weeks post treatment|Levels/Amount of Immunophenotypic Molecules from Blood Diagnostics (pg/mL), Immune response markers identified in the blood samples taken prior to cancer treatment and post treatment (exercise therapy occurring throughout this timeframe) will determine if the inclusion of this TENS unit exercise increases or decreases an immune response. The molecules identified will be measured in pg/mL, Beginning of cancer treatment to 4 weeks post-cancer treatment
