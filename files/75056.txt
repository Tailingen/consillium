Hippocampal Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation for Small Cell Lung Cancer
The Investigators are looking to compare standard treatment for the management of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) which is prophylactic cranial Irradiation (PCI) (shown to be very good in patient survival) with cranial sparing PCI. Although standard of care PCI is successful in patient survival it also has neurologic side-effects. The Investigators are hoping the cranial sparing PCI has the same positive survival results with the added benefit of lowering neurological side-effects.

RADIATION: Hippocampal-sparing Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation
Effect of Hippocampal-sparing Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation (PCI) on Possible Delayed Recall Toxicity as Assessed by the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R) for Delayed Recall, The primary endpoint of this study is cognitive function or memory. Memory is measured by participant performance on the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised for delayed recall (HVLT-R-Delayed Recall) at 6 months following hippocampal-sparing PCI. The HVLT-Delayed minimum and Maximum scores are 0-12. A higher score means a better outcome., Baseline, 6 months and 12 months post radiation treatment

Questions on the Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) assessment are on a four-point scale from "not at all" to "very much". Raw scores are linearly converted to a 0-100 scale with higher scores reflecting higher levels of function and higher levels of symptom burden. Questions on the QLQ-C30 cover the following:

* Dyspnoea
* Insomnia
* Appetite
* Constipation
* Diarrhoea
* Finances
* Fatigue
* Nausea/Vomiting
* Pain
* Physical Function
* Role Function

The standard of care in management of small cell lung cancer consists of chemotherapy plus thoracic radiation followed by prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) based on a randomized trial that demonstrated a significant improvement in overall survival (OS) with PCI. Unfortunately radiation therapy to the brain is associated with neurocognitive toxicity, which may be at least in part related to radiation induced injury to neural progenitor cells in the hippocampus. Both human and animal data suggest an inverse relationship between radiation dose to the hippocampus and performance on neuropsychological testing. We hypothesize that hippocampal sparing PCI will allow improved performance on tests of short term memory and executive function compared to a historical control (RTOG 0212) receiving the same dose of conventional PCI. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate performance on the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised for delayed recall at 6 months following hippocampal-sparing PCI relative to the historical control. Secondary objectives are to estimate: 1) composite cognitive function following hippocampal-sparing PCI relative to the historical control and 2) the rate of metastases in the hippocampus at 2 years following hippocampal-sparing PCI. The long term goal of this research is to reduce the long term sequelae of radiation therapy for both primary and metastatic brain tumors.
