Feasibility Study of a Molecular Karyotype Using a Very High-throughput Sequencing Approach, the "Massive Parallel Sequencing" on Circulating Tumor DNA
There are several types of circulating DNA: DNA from patient's existing cells, foetal DNA in the case of pregnant woman, and tumoral DNA in the case of patients with cancer. These circulating tumoral DNA (ctDNA) can be obtained from a blood test called liquid biopsy and be detected by the latest generation of very high throughput sequencers with the Massive Parallel Sequencing technique (MPS).

This study focus on using this technique on breast and colorectal cancers in which no analysis of CNV (tumor origin marker) with this technique has been performed yet. It is a prospective, pilot, monocentric, feasibility study on genomic profile. The study aim is to show the possibility to realize in a reproductive way a molecular karyotype on ctDNA with the MPS approach from a liquid biopsy taken from patients with cancer and to compare this profile with the one obtained by CGH array (Comparative Genomic Hybridization) from primitive tumor.
