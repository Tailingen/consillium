CART-meso in Mesothelin Expressing Cancers
Phase I study to establish safety and feasibility of intravenously administered lentiviral transduced CART-meso cells administered with and without cyclophosphamide in a 3+3 dose escalation design in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer, serous epithelial ovarian cancer, or pleural mesothelioma. Dose: 1-3xE7 /mE2 (Cohort 1 and 2) and 1-3xE8 /mE2 (Cohort 3 and 4 ) CAR+ T cells by intravenous route. In the event of 2 DLTs at each dose level, we will dose deescalate by 10-fold.
