Effect of Hepatectomy on the Prognosis of Patients With Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Liver Metastases
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn about hepatectomy on the prognosis of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma liver metastases (NCLM). The main questions it aims to answer are:

To explore the effect of hepatectomy on the overall survival, recurrence-free survival and other prognostic indicators of patients with NCLM.

To explore the impact of hepatectomy on the safety of patients with NCLM.

Researchers will compare the prognosis of the patients in the hepatectomy group and the patients with NCLM who were prospectively enrolled in the same institution and received only systemic treatment at the same time by propensity score matching.
