FIH Trial of VERT-002 in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors With MET Alterations
The goal of this clinical trial is to investigate the safety, the activity of VERT-002, and the optimal safe dose to be used, in participants with solid tumors including non-small cell lung cancer.
