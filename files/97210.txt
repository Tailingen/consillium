Study to Determine the Efficacy and Safety of Docetaxel and Doxorubicin With INGN 201 in Locally Advanced Breast Cancer
A maximum of 60 subjects will be enrolled in the trial. It is a non-randomized, open label, single center study. All subjects undergo INGN 201 injection and IV chemotherapy: doxorubicin and docetaxel. This is done on the first 2 days of a 3-week cycle. After completion of 4 to 6 cycles, the subject either proceeds to surgery if the tumors respond to therapy, or goes off study if there is no tumor response.
