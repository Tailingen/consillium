A Phase 1 Study of FOR46 in Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC)
This study will test the safety and efficacy of FOR46 given every 21 days to patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

The name of the study drug involved in this study is: FOR46 for Injection (FOR46)
Prostate Cancer Metastatic
DRUG: FOR46
Occurrence of toxicity, Type, incidence, severity, seriousness, and relatedness of adverse events., Through 1 month following last dose|Occurrence of dose-limiting toxicities, The severity and incidence of dose-limiting toxicities related to escalating dose levels of FOR46, Through 1 month following last dose|Disease response/composite response, Decline in serum prostate-specific antigen greater than 50% from baseline, confirmed by repeat measurement and objective response rate by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), 12 months
Characterize FOR46 plasma concentration, FOR46 maximum plasma concentration, Through 1 month following last dose|Characterize the FOR46 area under the curve, FOR46 area under the plasma concentration-time curve, Through 1 month following last dose|Characterize FOR46 elimination, FOR46 elimination half-life, Through 1 month following last dose|Antidrug Antibodies, Change from baseline in serum levels of antidrug antibodies, Through 1 month following last dose|Median radiographic progression-free survival, Assessed by Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 3 criteria, 12 months
Exploratory Endpoint: Tumor expression of CD46, Association between level of tumor expression of CD46 by immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis with clinical outcomes, Through 1 month following last dose
This study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and antitumor activity of FOR46 in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. This study will be conducted in two parts:

Dose escalation:

This part will evaluate increasing doses of FOR46 to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The first patient enrolled on the study will receive the lowest dose of FOR46. Once this dose is shown to be safe, a second patient will be enrolled at the next higher dose. Patients will continue to be enrolled into either single or multiple patient groups receiving increasing doses until the MTD is reached.

Dose expansion:

This part of the study will further evaluate the safety, tolerability and antitumor activity of FOR46 at a dose shown to be safe in the dose escalation part of the study. Patients will be enrolled into 1 of 2 groups, based on histology.
