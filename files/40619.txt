Preventing Lymphedema in Axillary Lymph Node Dissection
The researchers are trying to answer if axillary reverse mapping (ARM) with lympho-venous bypass (LVB) in patients undergoing an axillary lymph node dissection reduces the rate and severity of post-operative lymphedema of the arm.
Lymphedema|Breast Cancer|Melanoma
PROCEDURE: ALND with ARM +/- LVB|PROCEDURE: ALND
Less than 5% limb volume increase in the study extremity compared to baseline and the control extremity, Bilateral Limb volume measurements, 36 months following surgery|Less frequently reported symptoms of lymphedema in the study extremity compared to baseline and the control extremity, Validated patient reported surveys, 36 months following surgery
All subjects will undergo an axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Cluster randomization will determine which of these subjects will have the ARM with LVB and which subjects will have the ALND without this technique. As a baseline, all subjects will have the circumference of their arms measured and complete a questionnaire about lymphedema. Performing the measurements and answering a questionnaire will be repeated at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months after surgery.
