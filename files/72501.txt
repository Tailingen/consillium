Avelumab and Talazoparib in Untreated Advanced Ovarian Cancer (JAVELIN OVARIAN PARP 100)
JAVELIN Ovarian PARP 100 (B9991030) is an open-label, randomized study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of avelumab in combination with chemotherapy followed by maintenance therapy of avelumab in combination with talazoparib versus an active comparator in treatment-naïve patients with locally advanced or metastatic ovarian cancer (Stage III or Stage IV). On March 19, 2019, Sponsors alliance announced the discontinuation of the ongoing Phase III study, and the decision was based on several factors, including previous announced interim results from JAVELIN Ovarian 100 study (B9991010). Patients who remain in B9991030 study will continue receiving their randomized treatment assigned and will be monitored for appropriate safety assessments until treatment discontinuation.

Progression-free Survival (Participants With Newly Diagnosed Advanced Ovarian Cancer With Defects in DDR+）, Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from randomization to the date of the first documentation of objective progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. PD: \>=20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study. In addition to relative increase of 20%, sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5mm, appearance of one or more new lesions was considered PD., At screening, 9 and 18 weeks after date of randomization, then every 12 weeks thereafter until PD by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) regardless of initiation of new anti-cancer therapy
Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (On-Treatment Period), An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a study participant administered a product or medical device; the event need not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment or usage. A serious adverse event (SAE) was any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that resulted in death, was lifethreatening (immediate risk of death), required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions), resulted in congenital anomaly/birth defect or considered to be an important medical event. AEs included SAEs and non-serious AEs.

It was specifically designed to be a stand-alone instrument to measure disease-related symptoms, treatment side effects and function/well-being in participants with ovarian cancer.

The NFOSI-18 has several subscales: disease-related symptoms physical subscale(9 items), disease-related symptoms emotional subscale(1 item), treatment-related side effect subscale (5 items) and functional well-being (3 items). A high score was good. A score of "0" was a severely symptomatic participant and the highest possible score was an asymptomatic participant., 3 years|Programmed Death Receptor-1 Ligand-1 (PD-L1) Biomarker Expression in Tumor and Immune Cells as Assessed by Immunohistochemistry (IHC) at Baseline, The number of PD-L1 positive cells and/or qualitative assessment of PD-L1 staining on tumor and inflammatory cells in regions of interest that were defined by tumor cell morphology and the presence or absence of inflammatory cells, Baseline|Number of Participants With Mutations in Key Oncogenes at Baseline, Determination/estimation of the frequency of mutations (total and non-synonymous) present in baseline tumor derived nucleic acid samples and in baseline circulating tumor DNA., Baseline|EuroQol Group 5-Dimension 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L) Score, The EuroQol EQ-5D-5L was a 6 item participant-completed questionnaire designed to assess health status in terms of a single index value or utility score. There are 2 components to the EQ-5D-5L, a Health State Profile which had individuals rate their level of problems (none, slight, moderate, severe, extreme/unable) in 5 areas (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression), and a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) in which participants rate their overall health status from 0 (worst imaginable) to 100 (best imaginable). Published weights were available that allow for imputation of the index score. Overall index scores ranged from 0 to 1, with low scores representing a higher level of dysfunction., 3 years
JAVELIN Ovarian PARP 100 (B9991030) is an open-label, international, multi-center, randomized study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of avelumab in combination with chemotherapy followed by maintenance therapy of avelumab in combination with talazoparib versus an active comparator in treatment-naïve patients with locally advanced or metastatic ovarian cancer (Stage III or Stage IV). The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS) as determined based on blinded independent central review (BICR) assessment per RECIST v1.1.

On March 19, 2019, Sponsors alliance announced the discontinuation of the ongoing Phase III JAVELIN Ovarian PARP 100 study. The alliance has notified health authorities and trial investigators of the decision to discontinue the trial. The decision was based on several emerging factors since the trial's initiation, including the previously announced interim results from JAVELIN Ovarian 100 study (B9991010), which was stopped due to futility of efficacy at a planned interim analysis on 21 December 2018. The alliance determined that the degree of benefit observed with avelumab in frontline ovarian cancer in that study does not support continuation of the JAVELIN Ovarian PARP 100 trial in an unselected patient population and emphasizes the need to better understand the role of immunotherapy in ovarian cancer. Additional factors include the rapidly changing treatment landscape and the approval of a PARP inhibitor in the frontline maintenance setting. The decision to discontinue the JAVELIN Ovarian PARP 100 trial was not made for safety reasons.

Patients who remain in the study will continue receiving investigational products according to their randomized treatment assignment and will be monitored for appropriate safety assessments until treatment discontinuation.
