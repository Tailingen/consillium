True NTH Sexual Recovery Intervention for Prostate Cancer Survivors and Their Partners
There is increasing evidence that sexual activity is associated with greater resilience and higher well-being in older adults. Even at a time of stress, and even during a late stage of illness, men and their partners turn to sexual intimacy to increase a sense of connection, comfort and support. The Sexual Recovery intervention seeks to address an unmet need of prostate cancer survivors and their partners who are at risk for poor mental health and decreased quality of life as a result of sexual dysfunction.

By using technology, the intervention will be widely accessible to survivors, the majority of whom do not currently have any access to sexual health expertise. The content and format of the intervention seeks to empower prostate cancer survivors and partners with knowledge and strategies to improve their sexual function, sexual confidence and their sexual relationship. The intervention begins prior to and continues following their definitive treatment. This may, in turn, improve mental health and quality of life.

In a broader sense, this intervention will be transferable. With appropriate modifications, it can become an accessible sexual health intervention for populations dealing with other cancers and chronic illnesses.

PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) Sexual Satisfaction, The primary outcome is PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) Sexual Satisfaction. Basing power calculation on the average adjusted score (50) and standard deviation (10) provided in the PROMIS scoring, anticipating Sexual Satisfaction scores for the intervention group vs control group to be 50 vs 45, using a two-tailed t-test, power of 80%, and significance level of 0.05, it is expected this study will recruit 128 patients and 128 partners., 4 years
This proposal is innovative in a number of ways:

* The intervention is based on a full understanding of the complex nature of sexuality with its bio- (functional), psycho- (confidence), and social (relationship components). It incorporates modules that address each of these factors and their inter-dependencies.
* The intervention is sensitive to critical points in sexual recovery and to patient and partner preferences in the context of therapies for prostate cancer. The intervention acknowledges that there are certain time points at which concerns typically arise (e.g., when preparing for definitive treatment). The effectiveness of the intervention is increased by the use of tailoring linked to patient reported outcomes (e.g., decreased erectile function, increases in depression indices) and to patient/partner preferences.
* The intervention includes partners as equal stakeholders in the sexual recovery and legitimizes their needs for sexual fulfillment and support
* The intervention demonstrates a sensitivity to sexual orientation and cultural diversity
* The intervention is scalable and available at limited or no cost to prostate cancer survivors and their partners regardless of geographical location or system of care.
