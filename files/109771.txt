A Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of AUR108 in Patients With Relapsed Advanced Lymphomas (ASHA-1)
An open-label, first-in-human, Phase 1 study in adult patients with relapsed advanced lymphomas will be done to assess AUR108 safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and optimal biological dose.
Relapsed Advanced Lymphomas

First cycle Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT), Assess dose limiliting toxicities of AUR108, 28 Days|Safety of AUR108 as measured by the number of participants with treatment-related adverse events (AE) graded according to NCI CTCAE version 5.0, Number of participants with TEAEs, Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Pharmacokinetics Maximum Concentration (Cmax), Maximum Concentration of AUR108, Day 1 and Day 17|Pharmacokinetics: Time to Maximum concentration (Tmax), Tmax in hours, Day 1 and Day 17|Pharmacokinetics: Area under the curve (AUC), Area under the curve (AUC) of AUR108 in h\* ng/mL, Day 1 and Day 17|Pharmacokinetics: Terminal elimination half-life, Terminal elimination half-life of AUR 108 in hours, Day 17|Maximum concentration (Cmax) administered under fasting/fed condition, Compare in fast and fed conditions, Day 8|Time to Maximum concentration (Tmax) administered under fasting/fed condition, Compare Tmax in fast and fed conditions, Day 8|Area under curve (AUC) administered under fasting/fed condition, Compare AUC in fast and fed conditions, Day 8
PD biomarker assessment, Change from baseline in biomarker (DHO) levels, Day 1, Day 2, Day 17 and Day 18|Overall Response Rate, Efficacy assessments by Overall Response Rate, Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Duration of Response, Efficacy assessments by Duration of Response, Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Progression Free Survival, Efficacy assessments by Progression Free Survival (PFS), Through study completion, an average of 1 year
This is a Phase I, Open Label, Dose-Escalation, First-in-Human study in adult patients with select relapsed advanced lymphomas. The safety and tolerability of oral AUR108 will be evaluated in patients with Non-Hodgkin lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma who do not have any available curative or life-prolonging treatment options and have exhausted all effective locally available therapies. The traditional 3+3 design for dose escalation will be used to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, and determine the Optimal Biological Dose of AUR108 as a single agent. The Optimal Biological Dose will be selected using a totality of safety, PK, and PD data.
