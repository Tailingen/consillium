Carboplatin Plus Docetaxel With Day 2 Pegylated G-CSF (Neulasta®) in Patients With Advanced Stage Ovarian Carcinoma
In this study the investigators will be using an AUC of 6 based on creatinine clearance using the Carboplatin dosing formula used for Gynecologic Oncology Group protocols.

Given that myelosuppression was significant using the docetaxel dose of 75 mg/m\*2 in the SCOTROC trial, the prophylactic use of pegylated G-CSF in this Phase II trial is warranted. The expectation would be that patients will be able to receive their cycles in a more timely fashion, with less delays, thereby allowing for improved outcomes and decreased hospitalizations due to myelosuppression.
Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Pegylated G-CSF
Incidence of Grade 3-4 Neutropenia as Measured by CTCAE Version 3, Through 30 days after completion of treatment (approximately 22 weeks)
Efficacy of Regimen as Measured by CA-125 Response, * Progression is defined as one of the following:

  * Patients with elevated CA-125 pretreatment and normalization of CA-125 must show evidence of CA-125 ≥ twice the upper limit of normal on two occasions at least one week apart
  * Patients with elevated CA-125 pretreatment which never normalizes must show evidence of CA-125 ≥ 2 times the nadir value OR \> 50% increase from the nadir on two occasions at least one week apart,
  * Patients with CA-125 in the normal range pretreatment must show evidence of CA-125 ≥ two times the upper limit of normal on two occasions at least one week apart.
* Complete response is defined as a CA-125 value \<13 confirmed on two occasions at least 2 weeks apart.
* Partial Response is defined as a reduction of at least 50% from the original elevated CA-125 value (original value must have been \> 50), confirmed on two occasions at least 2 weeks apart.
* Stable Disease is defined as not meeting one of the above criteria., Completion of treatment (approximately 18 weeks)|Time to Progression (TTP), Progressive disease is at least a 20% increase in the sum of LD of target lesions taking as references the smallest sum LD or the appearance of new lesions within 8 weeks of study entry. Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions, other than pleural effusions without cytological proof of neoplastic origin, in the opinion of the treating physician within 8 weeks of study entry is also considered increasing disease (in this circumstance an explanation must be provided). In the case where the ONLY target lesion is a solitary pelvic mass measured by physical exam, which is not radiographically measurable, a 50% increase in the LD is required., Completion of follow-up|Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival is the observed length of life from entry into the study to death or the date of last contact, Completion of follow-up|Progression-free Survival (PFS), -Progression-Free Survival is the period from study entry until disease progression, death or date of last contact., Completion of follow-up|Quality of Life (QoL) as Measured by FACT-O Assessment Tool, * The FACT-O questionnaire consists of a Physical Well-Being Section, Social/Family Well-Being Section, Emotional Well-Being Section, Functional Well-Being Section, and Additional Concerns Section
* Answers range from "Not at all" to "Very Much" with 0 = not at all and 4 = very much, Completion of follow-up
Adverse Events as Measured by Number of Events Experienced by All Participants, 30 days after completion of treatment (approximately 22 weeks)
