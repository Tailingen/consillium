A New Agent GM-CT-01 in Combination With 5-FU, Avastin and Leucovorin in Subjects With Colorectal Cancer
The purpose of this clinical trial is to determine whether the combination of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) plus a DAVANAT (carbohydrate polymer) along with Avastin and Leucovorin (LV) is beneficial in treating colorectal cancer in patients unable to tolerate intensive chemotherapy.
Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: GM-CT-01|DRUG: 5-Fluorouracil, Leukovorin, bevacizumab
Primary Outcomes: Assess the efficacy and safety of GM-CT-01 administered with 5-FU, LV, and Avastin速 in the first-line treatment of unresectable, locally advanced, and/or metastatic CRC., To assess the clinical benefit of a regimen of GM-CT-01/5-FU, LV plus Avastin速 when administered intravenously as a first-line treatment to patients with Stage III or IV ,advanced or metastatic CRC. Clinical activity will be assessed by determining the percentage of subjects exhibiting an objective response (complete response \[CR\]) plus partial response \[PR\]). Tumor response will be assessed following Response Evaluation by RECIST guidelines., When 17 evaluable patients will complete the study
To evaluate the safety of the DAVANAT速/5-FU, LV plus Avastin速 regimen., Assess safety of regimen and also patient reported outcomes using a Quality of Life (QoL) instrument., Throughout the study and when 17 evaluable patients will when complete the study|Explore progression-free survival (PFS) and survival, To explore time to tumor progression, duration of response and and survival at 6 and 12 months after the first dose of study drug., When at least 17 evaluable patients complete the study
This is a Phase II, multi-center study of DAVANAT which has been shown to increase the anti-tumor activity of 5-FU in mice. 5-FU is a chemotherapy drug commonly used to treat tumors. A Phase I study of 40 patients showed that DAVANAT in different doses plus 5-FU was well tolerated in patients with different types of solid tumors who failed standard, approved treatments.
