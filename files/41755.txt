The Effect of Deferasirox on Response Rate of Acute Leukemia Patients Not Treated by Standard Chemotherapy Regimens
The purpose of this study is to determine whether deferasirox is effective in the treatment of acute lymphatic leukemia (ALL) and acute Myeloid leukemia (AML).
Acute Myeloid Leukemia|Acute Lymphoid Leukemia
DRUG: Cytarabine|DRUG: Deferasirox
complete Remission, first month
Partial Remission, up to four weeks
Many studies have demonstrated that Iron is essential for the metabolism, cell cycle regulation and metastasis in different cancer cell lines. It is also believed that Iron concentration will increase in cancer cells by enhancing expression of TFR-1 receptors and in case of receptor saturation, non-receptor-mediated pinocytosis would be a significant pathway for more iron intake. Iron deficiency may lead to increase P 53 which consequently will stop cell mitosis in G1-S state. It also increases expression of N-myc down-regulated gene 1 which can suppress metastasis in cancer. It has been suggested that Iron chelators may decrease leukemic tumor growth in animal models of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Some other case studies demonstrated the role of Iron chelators in relapse and/or refractory AML. Finally a phase 1 clinical study is undertaken for evaluate the role of Tiapine and cytarabine for adult AML and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome. So in this study the investigators try to evaluate the role of iron chelating agent (deferasirox) for patients with acute lymphatic leukemia (ALL) and AML patients who cannot be treated with standard chemotherapy regimes .
