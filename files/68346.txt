BBP-398 in Combination With Osimertinib in Locally Advanced or Metastatic NSCLC Patients With EGFR Mutations
This is an open-label, non-randomized, multi-cohort, multi-center Phase Ia/Ib study for BBP-398 in combination with Osimertinib to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, determine MTD and/or RP2D, and anti-cancer activity in locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations and with previously 3rd generation EGFR-TKIs treated or EGFR-TKI-naive.
NSCLC
DRUG: BBP-398|DRUG: osimertinib
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), Incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs)., From the first study administration to approximately 28 days after the last study administration|Serious adverse events (SAEs), Incidence and severity of Serious adverse events (SAEs), Administration to approximately 28 days after the last study administration|Phase Ib: ORR assessed by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1, ORR is defined as number of patients with confirmed responses of CR or PR, divided by the total number of treated patients with measurable disease at baseline assessed by the investigator., Every 8 weeks from first dose administration to the date of progression determined by the investigator or death due to any cause, whichever came first, assessed approximately 48 months.
Phase Ia: QT Interval, Evaluated by comparing the changes using electrocardiogram in the post-dose to the pre-dose., Approximately 6 months|Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), To characterize the pharmacokinetic parameter Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of BBP-398 and/or Osimertinib and its metabolites, Approximately 6 months|Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), To characterize the pharmacokinetic parameter Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) of BBP-398 and/or Osimertinib and its metabolites, Approximately 6 months|Time to Reach Maximum Plasma Concentration (Tmax), To characterize the pharmacokinetic parameter time to reach maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) of BBP-398 and/or Osimertinib and its metabolites., Approximately 6 months|Apparent total plasma clearance (CL/F), To characterize the pharmacokinetic parameter Apparent total plasma clearance (CL/F) of BBP-398 and/or Osimertinib and its metabolites., Approximately 6 months|Terminal elimination half-life (t1/2), To characterize the pharmacokinetic parameter Terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of BBP-398 and/or Osimertinib and its metabolites., Approximately 6 months|Accumulation ratio (Racc), To characterize the pharmacokinetic parameter Accumulation ratio (Racc) of BBP-398 and/or Osimertinib and its metabolites., Approximately 6 months|Phase Ib: DOR, DOR assessed by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1. DoR is defined as time interval from the first evaluation as CR or PR to the first evaluation as PD or death of any cause assessed by the investigator (percent of patients with ≥6 months, ≥9 months, and ≥12 months DoR will be reported)., Every 8 weeks from first evaluation as CR or PR to the first evaluation as PD or death of any cause, whichever came first, assessed approximately 24 months.|Phase Ib: PFS, PFS assessed by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1. PFS is defined from the first date of treatment to the date of progression determined by the investigator or death due to any cause (only for dose expansion)., Every 8 weeks from first evaluation as CR or PR to the first evaluation as PD or death of any cause, whichever came first, assessed approximately 24 months.|Phase Ib: OS, including 1-year and 2-years survival rate. OS is defined from the first date of treatment until date of death (only for dose expansion)., From the first date of treatment until date of death, assessed approximately 48 months.
