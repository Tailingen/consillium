Phase 2 Study of DKN-01 in Colorectal Cancer
This is a Phase 2 randomized, open-label, two-part, multicenter study with a safety run-in to evaluate efficacy and safety of DKN-01 plus FOLFIRI/FOLFOX and bevacizumab versus standard of care (SOC) \[FOLFIRI/FOLFOX and bevacizumab\] as second-line treatment of advanced CRC patients.

DRUG: DKN-01|DRUG: FOLFIRI|DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: FOLFOX
Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS, as determined by the Investigator per RECIST v1.1 of DKN-01 plus SOC versus SOC., approximately 6 months
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR, as determined by the Investigator per RECIST v1.1 of DKN-01 plus SOC versus SOC, approximately 6 months|Duration of Response (DoR), DoR, as determined by the Investigator per RECIST v1.1 of DKN-01 plus SOC versus SOC, approximately 6 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS with DKN-01 plus SOC versus SOC, approximately 6 months|Incidence of ≥Grade 3 related treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs)., approximately 6 months
Duration of Complete Response (DoCR), DoCR using RECIST v1.1, approximately 6 months|Duration of clinical benefit (DoCB), DoCB as determined using RECIST v1.1, is defined as the time from the date of randomization (or date of registration for Part A patients) to the time of progressive disease or death due to any cause in patients who had a best overall response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) of ≥8 weeks, approximately 6 months|Durable clinical benefit (DCB), DCB, defined as DoCB ≥180 days. Patients who have best overall response of PD or those having clinical benefit but DoCB lasting \<180 days will be considered as "non-DCB.", approximately 6 months|Disease control rate (DCR), DCR (i.e., CR+PR+SD at ≥8 weeks), as assessed by the Investigator using RECIST v1.1., approximately 6 months|Time to response (TTR), TTR, defined as the time from the date of randomization (or date of registration for Part A patients) to the assessment date of the first instance of an overall response of CR or PR., approximately 6 months|Exposure-response relationships for DKN-01 as data permit., approximately 6 months
This is a Phase 2 randomized, open-label, two-part, multicenter study with a safety run-in to evaluate efficacy and safety of DKN-01 plus FOLFIRI/FOLFOX and bevacizumab versus standard of care (SOC) \[FOLFIRI/FOLFOX and bevacizumab\] as second-line treatment of advanced CRC patients.

In Parts A and B, approximately 200 evaluable adult advanced CRC patients with measurable disease (RECIST v1.1) who have radiographically progressed during or following 1 line of systemic treatment will be enrolled in the study.

The study consists of a Screening Period, a Treatment Period, a Safety Follow-up Period (SFUP) and a Long-Term Follow-up Period (LTFU). Patients will be followed in the SFUP for approximately 30 days (+7 days) after the last administration of study drug and then enter the LTFU period to be followed for survival and subsequent therapies. Additionally, patients that ended study treatment for a reason unrelated to progressive disease \[PD\] will also be followed for disease progression in the LTFU period.
