A Study of GDC-0941 in Participants With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors for Which Standard Therapy Either Does Not Exist or Has Proven Ineffective or Intolerable
This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase I, dose-escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of orally administered GDC-0941 administered once daily (QD) and twice daily (BID) in the treatment of advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
