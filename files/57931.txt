Predictors for Low Rates of Surgical Resection in Elderly Patients With Resectable Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma
More and more older adults are diagnosed with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), but the rate of surgical resection in patients with resectable tumour is still low. Clinical workers need to take more attention to oncologic care in this group. It's significant to explore potential predictors for impacting elderly patients chose to abandon surgical resection.
Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma
OTHER: potential predictors
ORs of potential predictors, Univariate and multivariate logistic regression model were used to calculate ORs, months from diagnosis to surgical resection, up to 12 months
Overall survival (OS), The date of definite diagnosis to death or last follow up, up to 132 months
The incidence of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in the elderly has been on the rise, but the elderly were always neglected in clinical oncology care. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is a lethal disease, and the most effective treatment for curing it remains the radical resection. Unfortunately, there are many a study had reported that the rate of radical surgery of patients with PDAC has been low in the past decade. In order for more elderly pancreatic cancer patients to undergo surgical resection, investigators extracted the data of elderly patients with PDAC from SEER program and investigated predictive factors associated with surgical resection abandonment. In this study, investigators extracted data of patients older than 75 years diagnosed with T1-T3 stage PDAC to investigate rate of radical surgery. And researchers used Univariate and multivariate logistic regression model to explore potential factors associated with patients and surgeon chose to abandon surgical resection.
