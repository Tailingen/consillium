A Study of an Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) Candidate Vaccine, mRNA-1195, in 18- to 55-Year-Old Healthy Participants
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of mRNA-1195 in healthy participants.

There will be 2 sequential parts to the study:

* Participants 18 through 55 years of age will be enrolled in Part A of the study first, which will only enroll those participants who are EBV-seropositive at Screening.
* Part B will enroll participants 18 through 30 years of age who are either EBV-seronegative or EBV-seropositive at Screening.
