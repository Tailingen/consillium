This is a single arm, open-label, single-center study. This study is indicated for relapsed or refractory central nervous system CD19+ B-cell hematological malignancies, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia and B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The selections of dose levels and the numberof subjects are based on clinical trialsof similar foreign products. Two groups of patients will be enrolled, 36 in eachgroup. Primary objective is to explore the safety, main consideration is dose-related safety.
