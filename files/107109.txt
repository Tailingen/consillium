A Study of ARV-393 in Relapsed/Refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma.
This clinical trial is studying the safety and potential anti-tumor activity of an investigational drug called ARV-393 in patients diagnosed with advanced Relapsed/Refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma to determine if ARV-393 may be a possible treatment option.

ARV-393 is thought to work by breaking down a protein present in many types of non-Hodgkins lymphomas, which may prevent, slow or stop tumor growth. This is the first time ARV-393 will be used by people. The investigational drug will be given as an oral tablet.
Relapsed/Refractory (R/R) Mature B Cell Non Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL)|Relapsed/Refractory (R/R) Angioimmunoblastic T-cell Lymphoma (AITL)
DRUG: ARV-393
Incidence of Dose limiting toxicities during Cycle 1 (28 days), Percentage of participants in dose escalation arm at a given dose cohort with AEs meeting protocol defined dose limiting toxicities during cycle 1 (28 days), 28 days from first study dosing|Percentage of participants with Adverse Events characterized by severity, seriousness, and relationship to study drug as a measure of safety and tolerability, Adverse events as characterized by type, frequency, severity, seriousness, and relationship to study drug, From the study baseline to at least 30 days after last dose of ARV-393|Number of participants with abnormal vital signs, abnormal ECG readings ( QT interval) and abnormal laboratory parameters., Shifts in vital signs, ECGs, and laboratory parameters from study baseline, From the study baseline to at least 30 days after last dose of ARV-393|Percentage of participants with Grade 3 or Grade 4 clinical lab abnormalities using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) with scale from Grade 1 Grade 5. Higher score means worse outcome., Incidence of Grade 3 and Grade 4 clinical laboratory abnormalities, From the study baseline to at least 30 days after last dose of ARV-393
Area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) for ARV-393, Assessment of pharmacokinetic parameter AUC, 4 months from first drug dosing|Maximum concentration (Cmax) for ARV-393, Cmax is an assessment of pharmacokinetic parameter, 4 months from first drug dosing|Minimum concentration (Cmin) for ARV-393, Cmin is an assessment of pharmacokinetic parameter, 4 months from first drug dosing|Time to maximum concentration (Tmax) for ARV-393, Tmax is an assessment of pharmacokinetic parameter, 4 months from first drug dosing|Oral clearance (CL/F) for ARV-393, CL/F is an assessment of pharmacokinetic parameter, 4 months from first drug dosing|Volume of distribution (Vd/F) for ARV-393, Vd/F is a proportionality factor that relates the amount of drug in the body to the concentration of drug measured in a biological fluid., 4 months from first drug dosing|Overall response rate (ORR) in participants, ORR is a parameter measuring the anti-tumor activity of ARV-393. it is the percentage of participants reaching a complete response or partial response to the study treatment according to the Lugano response criteria for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma., Approximately 2 years|Complete response rate (CRR), CRR is a parameter measuring the anti-tumor activity of ARV-393. CRR is percentage of participants with best of response reported as complete response according to the Lugano response criteria for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, Approximately 2 years|Duration of response (DOR), DOR is the time from the initial response (CR or PR) to the date of progression, or death, whichever occurs first. It is a parameter measuring the anti-tumor activity of ARV-393, Approximately 2 years
This is an open-label, multicenter, phase 1, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary anti-tumor activity of ARV-393 as a single agent in adult patients with relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
