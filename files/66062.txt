Culturally Tailored HPV Psychoeducational Multimedia Intervention
Community members ages 18 - 45 years old from the El Paso, Texas, U.S.-Mexico Border Region will be recruited to compare psychoeducational multimedia interventions focused on the human papillomavirus (HPV). Our hypothesis is that adults who view culturally tailored multimedia stories encouraging HPV vaccination will report higher vaccine uptake rates.

Between-group changes in proportions from baseline scores on the Vaccination Decision Stage scale and post-intervention scores of the Community Intervention Survey., 3-item Vaccination Decision Stage scale (HPV vaccine uptake \[yes, no\], HPV vaccine intention \[scored on a likert scale from 1) Strongly disagree to (5) Strongly agree\])., Baseline (pre-assessment), immediately post-intervention (0 months), 1 month post-intervention
Between-group changes in proportions from baseline scores on the HPV Vaccine Attitudes scale and post-intervention scores of the Community Intervention Survey., 11-item HPV Vaccine Attitudes scale (perceived safety, perceived harm, perceived effectiveness) scored on a Likert scale from Strongly disagree (1) to Strongly agree (5)., Baseline (pre-assessment), immediately post-intervention (0 months), 1 month post-intervention|Between-group changes in proportions from baseline scores on the HPV Knowledge scale and post-intervention scores of the Community Intervention Survey., 14-item HPV Knowledge scale scored as True (1) or False (0) on a composite average and multiplied by 100 to obtain a percentage., Baseline (pre-assessment), immediately post-intervention (0 months), 1 month post-intervention
A sample of vaccine-naive (unvaccinated or under-vaccinated) adult community members ages 18 - 45 years old from the El Paso, Texas, U.S.-Mexico Border Region, will be recruited to participate in a human papillomavirus (HPV) multi-media intervention. Hypothesis: Vaccine-eligible adults who view culturally tailored multimedia stories encouraging HPV vaccination will report significantly stronger vaccine intentions and, subsequently, significantly higher vaccine uptake rates when compared to vaccine-eligible adults exposed to a standard HPV vaccination fact sheet and generic HPV vaccine videos.
