Combined Immunotherapy and Radiosurgery for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
A single institution study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination treatment of nivolumab, ipilimumab, CMP-001 and radiosurgery in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer with liver metastases.

Number of participants with serious dose-limiting treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) are defined below and only include AEs that are considered possibly, probably, or definitely related to the CMP-001, nivolumab or ipilimumab treatments which occur during the first 42 days of therapy, starting from completion of SBRT (day 1).

The following AEs will be considered DLTs if deemed related to study therapy:

Hematologic

* Grade 4 neutropenia
* Febrile neutropenia, defined as absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \<1000/mm3 with a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius.
* Grade 3 neutropenic infection
* Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding
* Grade 4 thrombocytopenia

Non-hematologic:

* Grade 3 toxicities (non-laboratory)
* Grade 3 nausea, vomiting or diarrhea despite maximal medical intervention
* Grade 4 aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) Other (non AST/ALT) non-hematologic G 3 laboratory value if the abnormality leads to overnight hospitalization, The dose-limiting toxicity period lasts from day 1 until day 42 inclusive
Response rate as assessed by RECIST v1.1, To evaluate the objective tumor response rate (ORR; including complete response, CR, or partial response, PR) from a combination treatment with nivolumab, ipilimumab, CMP-001 and radiosurgery as assessed by RECIST v1.1. Of note, the irradiated and injected lesion will not be used for RECIST v1.1 analysis., assessed at week 10, week 18, and week 24|Progression free survival, To evaluate the progression free survival (PFS) for treatment with a combination of nivolumab, ipilimumab, CMP-001 and radiosurgery defined as the time from first dose until disease progression or death (or date of last documentation of being alive), respectively., from time of first dose for 24 months
Patients will be treated with radiosurgery to liver metastases (completed by day 1), followed by a priming dose of subcutaneous CMP-001 (day 1 Â± 4 days), intratumoral injections of CMP-001 on days 13, 36 and 55, combined with nivolumab 3mg/kg every 2 weeks (start day 15) and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks (start day 15). From day 71 biweekly subcutaneous injections of CMP-001 will commence. Nivolumab, ipilimumab and subcutaneous injections of CMP-001 will be continued until disease progression or up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Two research biopsies will be taken from a liver metastasis. The first biopsy will be taken during the screening period (pretreatment) and the second one 5 weeks post-radiosurgery (which is 3 weeks post-initiation of nivolumab / ipilimumab). As a safety run-in, the initial cohort of 3-6 patients will not receive radiosurgery. The next cohort will not commence until the last patient from the initial cohort has been followed up for at least 8 weeks post first intratumoral injection. Efficacy endpoints will be based upon a non-irradiated lesion.
