BMS-247550 in Treating Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of BMS-247550 in treating patients who have advanced pancreatic cancer.
Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: ixabepilone
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the 6-month survival rate and time to treatment failure in patients with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated with BMS-247550.
* Determine the frequency and severity of toxic effects of this drug in these patients.
* Determine the complete and partial response in those patients with measurable disease treated with this drug.
* Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of this drug in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive BMS-247550 IV over 3 hours on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years and then annually until 3 years after registration.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25-55 patients will be accrued for this study.
