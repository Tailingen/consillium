The objectives of this study are to assess molecular testing, treatment patterns, and associated clinical outcomes among patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation-positive locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have progressed from first-line EGFR-TKI (tyrosine kinase inhibitor) therapy. This study is descriptive in nature and does not attempt to test any specific a priori hypotheses
