A Phase I/Ib Trial for the Evaluation of SAR260301 in Monotherapy or in Combination With Vemurafenib in Patients With Various Advanced Cancer
Primary Objective:

Part A - Monotherapy:

- To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SAR260301 administered as monotherapy and either on a once or twice daily schedule, to patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphomas.

Part B - Combination:

- To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SAR260301 administered in combination with the recommended standard dosage of vemurafenib to patients with unresectable / metastatic v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF)-mutated melanoma.

Secondary Objectives:

* To characterize the overall safety and tolerability profile of SAR260301 administered as monotherapy (Part A) and in combination with vemurafenib (Part B).
* To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of SAR260301 administered as monotherapy (Part A) and in combination with vemurafenib (Part B) as well as vemurafenib PK in combination with SAR260301 (Part B)
* To evaluate food effect on SAR260301 PK (Part A)
* To assess preliminary antitumor activity according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1 criteria).
* To assess preliminary antitumor activity using volumetric computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging(MRI)
* To evaluate the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of SAR260301 on blood and tumor.
* To evaluate PK/PD relationships.
* To identify the recommended phase 2 dose of SAR260301 in combination with vemurafenib (RP2D) (Part B only)
* To assess potential induction effect of SAR260301 on cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzyme 3A (CYP3A) (Part A)

Study duration for one patient will include a period for inclusion (screening period) of up to 4 weeks, a treatment period of at least 4 weeks, and a end-of-study visit at 30 days following the last administration of study drug. The patient may continue treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or willingness to stop, followed by a minimum of 30-days follow-up.
