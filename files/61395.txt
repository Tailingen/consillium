Two separate registration trials conducted under one protocol number are proposed to adequately and independently evaluate the addition of glasdegib in intensive and non-intensive chemotherapy populations. Each study will have an experimental treatment arm and a placebo arm. Endpoints are the same for each study except where specifically indicated.

Assignment to the Intensive Study or the Non-Intensive Study will be made by the Investigator based on the 2017 European LeukemiaNet (ELN) recommendations.

Study B1371019 is a randomized (1:1), double-blind, multi-center, placebo controlled study of chemotherapy in combination with glasdegib versus chemotherapy in combination with placebo in adult patients with previously untreated AML.

Glasdegib is being studied in combination with azacitidine for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who are not candidates for intensive induction chemotherapy (Non-intensive AML population).
