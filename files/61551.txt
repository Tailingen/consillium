A Combination Study of CAR-T Therapy in r/r B-NHL
In registry studies of CAR-T products that have been marketed globally, patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (r/r B-NHL) have been enrolled to receive CAR-T infusion in combination with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKi) or immune checkpoint inhibitors (PD-1 or PD-L1 antibodies), with objective remission rate (ORR) for CAR-T in combination with BTKi ranging from 83.3%-100% and complete remission rate (CRR) were 33.3-75%. The ORRs for objective remission rates for CAR-T combined with PD1/PD-L1 ranged from 50-91% and CRRs were 33.3-64%, respectively. With regard to safety, no dose-limiting toxic (DLT) occurred and the incidence of other adverse reactions was low, and studies demonstrated that BTKi or PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies could further enhance the responsiveness and durability of anti-CD19 CAR-T cell therapy. However, there are no studies exploring the efficacy and safety of clinical regimens using BTKi + radiotherapy ± chemotherapy as a bridging regimen to treat r/r B-NHL in combination with BTKi and/or PD-1 inhibitor after CAR-T cell infusion. In real-world applications of commercial CAR-T, CAR-T therapy combined with BTKi or PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies may further improve response rates and remission persistence in r/r B-NHL patients receiving CAR-T infusion back, with efficacy benefits while ensuring a manageable safety profile. Therefore, our center plans to conduct a phase II clinical study of Regent CAR-T 001(A phase II study of BTKi+radiotherapy±chemotherapy bridging before CAR-T cell therpay in combination with BTKi±PD-1 inhibitor for r/r B-NHL).
Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: BTK inhibitor|DRUG: PD-1 inhibitor
3-month complete response rate, Percentage of participants with complete response at 3-months after CAR-T infusion determined on the basis of investigator assessments according to 2014 Lugano criteria., 3-months after CAR-T infusion
Number of Participants With Treatment-Related Adverse Events as Assessed by CTCAE v5.0, An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events., End of treatment visit (2 years after CAR-T cell infusion)|1-month objective response rate, Percentage of participants with response at 1-month after CAR-T infusion determined on the basis of investigator assessments according to 2014 Lugano criteria., 1 month after CAR-T infusion|Progression-free survival, Progression-free survival was defined as the time from the date of leukapheresis until the date of the first documented day of disease progression or relapse, using 2014 Lugano criteria, or death from any cause, whichever occurred first., End of treatment visit (2 years after CAR-T cell infusion)|Overall survival, Overall survival was defined as the time from the date of leukapheresis to the date of death from any cause., End of treatment visit (2 years after CAR-T cell infusion)|Time to reponse, Time from CAR-T cell infusion to the first assessment of CR or PR on the basis of investigator assessments according to 2014 Lugano criteria., End of treatment visit (2 years after CAR-T cell infusion)|Duration of response, Time from the first efficacy assessment of CR or PR to the time of first disease progression on the basis of investigator assessments according to 2014 Lugano criteria., End of treatment visit (2 years after CAR-T cell infusion)|Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Detection of maximum amount of CAR-T cell expansion in patients., End of treatment visit (2 years after CAR-T cell infusion)|Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), The area under the CAR-T concentration curve in 28 days after infusion., 28 days after infusion|Time to Peak Plasma Concentration (Tmax), The time to reach the highest CAR-T concentration, End of treatment visit (2 years after CAR-T cell infusion)
