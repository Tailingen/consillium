MRI and PET Imaging in Predicting Treatment Response in Patients With Stage IB-IVA Cervical Cancer
This trial studies magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in predictive treatment response in patients with stage IB-IVA cervical cancer. MRI is a procedure in which radio waves and a powerful magnet linked to a computer are used to create detailed pictures of areas inside the body. PET is a procedure in which a small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein, and a scanner is used to make detailed, computerized pictures of areas inside the body where the glucose is taken up. Comparing results of diagnostic procedures, such as MRI and PET, done before, during and after radiation and chemotherapy may help doctors predict a patient's response to treatment and help plan the best treatment.

Predictive power of the heterogeneity metrics will be compared and ranked with Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage, lymph node status, histology, hemoglobin level, and tumor anatomic volumes. Multivariate predictive algorithms will be derived by synergizing the predictive power of imaging metrics and clinical prognosticators for clinical translation., Up to 5 years
OUTLINE:

Patients undergo radiation therapy and receive chemotherapy per standard of care. Patients undergo dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI, diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI, and magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy at baseline, 2-2.5 weeks, 4-5 weeks, and 1 month following radiation therapy completion, and fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG) PET/computed tomography (CT) at baseline, 2-2.5 weeks, and 4-5 weeks.

After completion of study, patients are followed up at least every 3-6 months for 5 years.
