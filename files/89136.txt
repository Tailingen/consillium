Healthy Eating and Active Lifestyle (HEAL): Breast Cancer Program Outcomes
The goal of this single-group prospective study is to examine the impact of the Healthy Eating and Active Lifestyle (HEAL) Breast Cancer program on participants' perceived stress, biometrics, basic labs, lifestyle behaviors, self-efficacy, mental health, and quality of life.

Participants will participate in an 8-week program of 90-minute virtual sessions each week to decrease risk of cancer recurrence. Program participants can choose to participate in the research study which will include data collection (surveys, biometrics, basic labs). The data collection will occur at four timepoints - baseline prior to program start, post-program, 3 month follow-up, and 6 month follow-up.
