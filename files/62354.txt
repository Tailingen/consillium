Gemcitabine and Nab-paclitaxel Combined With Momelotinib in Participants With Previously Untreated Metastatic Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma
There will be two phases to this study. The lead-in phase will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of momelotinib (MMB) combined with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine (nab-P + G) in adults with previously untreated metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The randomized treatment phase will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of nab-P + G with either MMB administered at the MTD or placebo in adults with previously untreated metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Participants will continue study treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, consent withdrawal, or participant's refusal of treatment. Following treatment, participants will be followed for safety for 30 days and for survival approximately every 3 months for up to 3 years.
Metastatic Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: Momelotinib|DRUG: Placebo to match momelotinib|DRUG: Nab-paclitaxel|DRUG: Gemcitabine
Lead-In Phase: Percentage of Participants Experiencing Treatment-Emergent Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) Adverse Events, Dose limiting toxicities were based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03. Dose limiting toxicities referred to toxicities experienced during the first 28 days (Cycle 1) of treatment that were judged to be clinically significant and related to study treatment.

No statistical analysis was planned or performed for this endpoint., Up to 28 Days|Randomized Treatment Phase: Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival was defined as the time interval from first dose date of MMB to death from any cause, Baseline up to the Date of Death or Censoring, up to 3 years
Lead-In Phase: Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival was defined as the time interval from first dose date of MMB to death from any cause, Baseline up to the Date of Death or Censoring, up to 3 years|Lead-In Phase: Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival was defined as the time interval from the first dose of MMB to the earlier of the first documentation of definitive disease progression or death from any cause. Definitive disease progression is progression based on Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria v1.1. Data from survival, non-progressing participants will be censored at the earliest of the time of initiation of anti-tumor therapy other than the study treatment or the last time that lack of definitive disease progression was objectively documented while on study., Baseline up to the Date of Event or Censoring, up to 3 years|Lead-In Phase: Overall Response Rate (ORR), The ORR was defined as the proportion of participants who achieved a best overall response (BOR) during MMB therapy of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as assessed by RECIST v1.1., Baseline up to the Last Tumor Assessment Date, up to 3 years|Randomized Treatment Phase: Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival was defined as the time interval from the first dose of MMB to the earlier of the first documentation of definitive disease progression or death from any cause, Baseline up to the Date of Event or Censoring, up to 3 years|Randomized Treatment Phase: Overall Response Rate, The ORR was defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved a best overall response (BOR) during MMB therapy of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), Baseline up to the Last Tumor Assessment Date, up to 3 years
