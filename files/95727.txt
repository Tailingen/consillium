Thromboelastography During Surgery for Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma
Surgery for malignant pleural mesothelioma is complex and prolonged, and may involve significant blood loss with considerable blood and product transfusion. Thromboelastography (TEG) is a global assay of coagulation that uses whole blood to produce a tracing that records kinetic changes in clot formation. This study aims provide a better understanding of the coagulation profile of these patients, and will form the basis of a TEG-based transfusion algorithm for future surgeries for mesothelioma.
Coagulopathy|Mesothelioma
PROCEDURE: Blood draw for TEG analysis
Coagulation profile during extrapleural pneumonectomy or pleurectomy, Reaction time, alpha angle, maximum amplitude and clot lysis from thromboelastography give a better picture of coagulation at different phases of surgery, Surgical period (4-6 hours)
Thromboelastography can provide more in-depth and quicker analysis of the complex coagulation processes during surgery
