Palliative RadIotherapy of Multiple Metastatic Sites Before First Line of Systemic Therapy with Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors and Chemotherapy in Metastatic Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer
The study is designed as a non-randomized Phase 2 clinical intervention study. The study will include patients with disseminated Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC) which are eligible for first line of systemic treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors and platinum-based chemotherapy (PDL1 less than 50%). Patients will receive palliative radiotherapy to multiple sites (2 to 5 sites) prior to systemic treatment.

Results of treatment will be compared to historical cohort of patients treated only with systemic therapy.

RADIATION: Palliative Radiotherapy: 5 x 4Gy|DRUG: chemotherapy + immune checkpoint inhibitors
Progression Free Survival (PFS), Disease status will be evaluated based on imaging results until progression or death; assessed every three months., From the date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 18 months after the completion of study.
Overall Survival (OS), Amount of time from treatment until death, reported via follow up visit or phone call., From the date of randomization until the date of death, or the last follow up date on which the participant was reported alive, assessed up to 18 months.|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Using assessment according to RECIST (after 3 months and time to ORR). Percentage of patients with a complete response or partial response., Assessment after 3 months after the date of randomization and every 3 months up until progression. Assessed up to 18 months after the completion of study.|Patterns of progression, Percentage of patients with recorded first site of progression of disease at irradiated sites and non-irradiated sites or both., Assessed up to 18 months after the completion of study.|A review of predictive maker PDL1 - indicating a better response to combination therapy, - Percentage of PDL 1 expression on tumour cells, where PFS was significantly better in combination therapy., From the start of treatment until the date of documented progression or death, whichever comes first, assessed up to 18 months after the completion of study.
The primary objective is to investigate efficacy of radiation therapy before the first line of systemic therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors and platinum-based chemotherapy in metastatic NSCLC (PDL1 less than 50%).
