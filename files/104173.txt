Autohypnosis and Cancerology
Therapeutical hypnosis is proven to be an effective medical support to chemotherapy: it was shown that it can reduce the pain, anxiety, fatigue felt by the patient.

Yet, hypnosis requires the presence of an hypnotherapist, which is why auto-hypnosis could be an efficient alternative to handle the side effects of chemotherapy.

In this study, colorectal cancer and breast cancer patients are either taught auto-hypnosis or are taken in standard care for their chemotherapy.

The life quality score (QLQC30) assessed during and after chemotherapies will determine if auto-hypnosis is a good medical support in chemotherapies' adverse effects management.

The proven benefices of auto-hypnosis in the handling of the side effects of chemotherapies could improve the quality of life of cancer affected patients.
