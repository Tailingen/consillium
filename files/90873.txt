IPH5201 and Durvalumab in Patients With Resectable Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (MATISSE)
The study is intended to assess the safety and efficacy of neoadjuvant combination of IPH5201 and durvalumab in addition to standard chemotherapy and adjuvant combination of IPH5201 and durvalumab in untreated patients with resectable, early-stage (stage II to IIIA) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

This is an open-label, single-arm multicenter study. Eligible patients will be enrolled and will receive IPH5201 + Durvalumab + standard of care chemotherapy before surgery followed by IPH5201 + Durvalumab post-surgery.
