Pilot Study of Antiviral Treatment in Combination With Low-dose Gemcitabine in EBV-associated Gastric Cancer (EBVaGC)
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a double-stranded DNA human gamma herpes virus that establishes a persistent infection in over 90% of individuals. Most infections are self-limiting, but some cases are associated with the development of malignancies of lymphoid or epithelial origin. EBV-associated gastric carcinomas (EBVaGC) make up about 9% of all stomach cancers.

The constant presence of the viral genome in EBVaGC suggests the applicability of novel EBV-targeted therapies.

The antiviral nucleoside drug, (val)ganciclovir (GCV), is effective only in the context of the viral lytic cycle in the presence of EBV-encoded thymidine kinase (TK)/ protein kinase (PK) expression. JM Lee et al. reported that gemcitabine was lytic inducer via activation of the ATM/p53 genotoxic stress pathway in EBVaGC and confirmed the efficacy of gemcitabine-GCV combination treatment.

So we planned this proof of concept trial to apply the antiviral agent in EBVaGC.
Gastric Cancer
DRUG: Antiviral treatment in combination with low-dose gemcitabine
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Modified RECIST 1.1 criteria will be used to assess patient response to treatment by determining PFS and ORR. The modified RECIST 1.1 guidelines for measurable, non-measurable, target and non-target lesions and the objective tumour response criteria, up to 24months
Best Overall Response Rate (BOR), Modified RECIST 1.1 criteria will be used to assess patient response to treatment by determining PFS and ORR. The modified RECIST 1.1 guidelines for measurable, non-measurable, target and non-target lesions and the objective tumour response criteria, up to 24months
