Clinical Trial of Atezolizumab With Paclitaxel, Trastuzumab, and Pertuzumab in Patients With Metastatic HER-2 Positive Breast Cancer
This is a single arm, Phase IIA clinical trial assessing the safety and efficacy of atezolizumab in combination with paclitaxel, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab in 50 patients with locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic HER2-overexpressing breast cancer. Due to concerns that corticosteroids may have a negative effect on tumor immunity expected with addition of atezolizumab to the standard of care regimen, patients will receive premedication with dexamethasone only for weeks 1 and 2 of the weekly paclitaxel, and then corticosteroid premedication will be discontinued subsequently.

Patients must have pathologically confirmed HER2-overexpressing breast cancer that is locally recurrent, unresectable, or metastatic, with measurable disease as defined by RECIST v1.1. Tumor measurements and bone scans will be performed every 9 weeks while patients are on study.
HER2-positive Breast Cancer
DRUG: Atezolizumab|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Trastuzumab|DRUG: Pertuzumab
Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events, Treatment-related adverse events will be assessed by CTCAE v4.0, Up to 5 years after stopping study treatment|Antitumor activity of atezolizumab plus the standard regimen of paclitaxel, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab, Antitumor activity will be measured by RECIST v1.1, An average of 18 weeks
Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from initiation of treatment until death from any cause or end of the study period, whichever occurs first., Up to 5 years after the last patient stops treatment|Time to tumor progression (TTP), TTP is defined as the duration of time from the start of treatment to the first objectively documented instance of progressive disease., Up to 5 years after the last patient stops treatment|Time to treatment failure (TTF), TTF is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to discontinuation of study treatment for reasons defined in the protocol., Up to 5 years after the last patient stops treatment|Progression free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first., Up to 5 years after the last patient stops treatment|Clinical benefit rate (CBR), CBR is defined as the rates of complete response (CR), partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD)., Up to 5 years after the last patient stops treatment|Duration of response (DOR), Per RECIST v1.1, DOR will be assessed by the duration of overall response, duration fo CR/PR, and duration of SD., Up to 5 years after the last patient stops treatment|Correlation of biomarkers related to PD-L1 blockade with objective response rate (ORR), CBR, PFS, OS, and DOR., Efficacy will be assessed according to tumor PD-L1 expression level and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes PD-L1 expression levels., Up to 5 years after the last patient stops treatment|Efficacy according to hormone receptor status (ER/PR), This will be a future subset analysis., Up to 5 years after the last patient stops treatment|Feasibility of discontinuation of corticosteroids use after 2 weekly doses of paclitaxel, This will be assessed by CTCAE v4.0., Up to 5 years after the last patient stops treatment|Rate of occurrence of paclitaxel-related infusion hypersensitivity reaction after discontinuation of corticosteroids, This will be assessed by CTCAE v4.0., An average of 18 weeks|Cardiac safety, Quarterly MUGA or ECHO results assessing occurrence of left ventricular dysfunction., An average of 18 weeks
