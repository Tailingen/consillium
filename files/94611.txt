Usefulness of Endocuff in the Adenoma Detection Rate. Comparative Study
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer death worldwide. The cumulative risk of developing CRC is about 6% lifelong.

The benefit of screening colonoscopy depends on the detection and removal of all adenomas, however, some of these may be difficult to detect.

The "endocuff" (EC) is a polymer sleeve which joins the tip of the colonoscope to improve the image viewing of the mucosa during colonoscopy procedure.

There is insufficient evidence of the usefulness of endocuf
Colorectal Canceer
DEVICE: ENDOCUFF
Adenoma detection rate, Percentage of adenomas detected during colonoscopy, 30 minutes|Measurement of the polyp detection rate, Percentage of polyps detected during colonoscopy, 30 minutes
Cecal intubation rate, Percentage of cecal intubation, 30 minutes|ileal intubation rate, Percentage of ileal intubation, 10 minutes|Difficulty performing polypectomy, When the endoscopist requiring special maneuvers to perform polypectomy, 10 minutes|Complications during colonoscopy, When patients require special handling during or immediately subsequent colonoscopy, One week
All patients requiring colonoscopy for screening and who agree to participate in the study will be included and randomized them to make an standard colonoscopy or colonoscopy with endocuff, for randomization system will be used in balanced blocks of 4, created on the page randomization.com.
