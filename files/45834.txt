Inadvertent Hypothermia or Hyperthermia in Pediatric Radiotherapy Practices Under Anesthesia
In prospective, observational cohort study, changes in body temperature will be investigated before the procedure and during recovery in Radiotherapy patients aged 0-18 years who need sedation due to childhood malignancies.

The aims of this study were to measure the incidence and magnitude of changes in body temperature in children undergoing sedation or general anesthesia for Radiotherapy, and to determine their effects on the recovery process.
