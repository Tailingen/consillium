PEWS Implementation in an LMIC Setting
The PEWS implementation study will be undertaken with the following objectives:

1. Assess the effectiveness of implementation of PEWS and resuscitation training to identify patients at risk for clinical deterioration and to impact the frequency of clinical interventions made by treating providers on these patients.
2. Assess the effectiveness of implementation of PEWS and resuscitation training to impact time sensitive clinical interventions made on patients at risk for clinical deterioration.
3. Assess the impact of implementation of PEWS and resuscitation training on length of stay for patients admitted to the pediatric oncology ward.

OTHER: pediatric early warning scoring system and resuscitation curriculum
Elevated Pediatric Early Warning Score (PEWS), frequency of patients whose PEWS score indicates 'risk for clinical deterioration' and receive a clinical intervention. PEWS 3 or greater (Scale is PEWS 0-6) is defined as at risk for clinical deterioration with a higher score concerning for worse clinical outcome., 1 year
Time to antibiotics, Time to antibiotics defined as time from documented vital signs/PEWS to time of antibiotic administration measured in minutes, 1 year|Time to IV fluid bolus, Time to fluids defined as time from documented vital signs/PEWS to time of documented IV fluid bolus measured in minutes, 1 year|Volume of IV fluids, Volume of fluids received defined as volume given up to 60 minutes after the initiation of the first fluid bolus measured in milliliters, 1 year|Length of stay, Length of stay for all patients admitted to the inpatient ward, 1 year
