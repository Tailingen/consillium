Perioperative Management of Colorectal Cancer Patients Infected With COVID-19: a Multicenter Prospective Cohort Study.
This trial is a multicenter prospective cohort study to explore timing of colorectal cancer surgery after COVID-19 infection so that can assist clinicians and patients. Currently, there is less evidence on perioperative outcomes after COVID-19 vaccination and the omicron variant. Therefore, it is necessary to update previously published consensus which recommends that patients should avoid elective surgery within 7 weeks of COVID-19 infection remain, unless the benefits of doing so exceed the risk of waiting. Aiming at the above problems, we plan to carry out a multicenter prospective cohort study to develop perioperative management according patients' different conditions.
