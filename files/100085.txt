Melatonin Oral Gel for Oral Mucositis in Patients With Head and Neck Cancer Undergoing Chemoradiation
The main purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of melatonin oral gel compared to placebo in the prevention and treatment of oral mucositis in patients with head and neck cancer undergoing concurrent chemoradiation.

Other objectives are to assess the Quality of Life (QoL), to evaluate the safety and tolerability and to assess the pharmacokinetic profile of melatonin oral gel administration, in all cases compared to placebo in patients with head and neck cancer and oral mucositis secondary to concurrent chemoradiation.

The study is designed as a prospective, randomized, double blind and placebo-controlled study.

Eligible patients with head and neck cancer undergoing chemoradiation will be randomized assigned at one-to-one ratio to receive

* Group A: melatonin oral gel 3%
* Group B: placebo

All patients will receive standard symptomatic treatment for oral mucositis along the study according to routine clinical practice of the hospital.

A full PK and safety assessment will be carried out in the first 24 patients included in the study (PK subgroup).

All patients will take melatonin oral gel 3% or placebo oral gel from two to three days before start of systemic treatment until one to four weeks after completion of radiotherapy. In the case of concurrent chemotherapy with cisplatin, patients will remain on study from the first day of chemoradiotherapy during 19 weeks (seven on chemoradiotherapy treatment, a maximum of four weeks after completion of radiotherapy and eight more weeks on observation). In the case of patients receiving cetuximab, since the first infusion of cetuximab will be administered one week before the first day of radiation, the patients will remain on study during 20 weeks (eight weeks on chemoradiotherapy, a maximum of four weeks after completion of radiotherapy and eight more weeks on observation). Investigators should take into account that the minimum duration of the melatonin oral gel 3% treatment would be 8 weeks for patients treated with cisplatin and 9 weeks for patients treated with cetuximab.

Patients with oral mucositis improved to grade 1 (based on RTOG) until one to four weeks after the end of chemoradiation may stop melatonin oral gel 3% or placebo treatments. Patients with grade â‰¥ 2 oral mucositis at this time-point (four weeks after the end of chemoradiation) will stop treatment per protocol (melatonin or placebo) and will continue with standard treatments and under observation until the last safety visit.
