Soy Isoflavone in Combination With Radiation Therapy and Cisplatin in SCC of the Head and Neck
The purpose of this study is to determine if soy supplementation during chemotherapy and radiation therapy will decrease side effects caused by treatment. Long-lasting dry mouth is a side effect of the standard treatment, and we are testing whether soy supplementation during treatment may reduce this symptom and other side effects of chemoradiation.

DRUG: Soy isoflavone|RADIATION: Radiation|DRUG: Cisplatin
Percentage of patients with grade 2 or higher xerostomia at 1 year post-treatment, The primary outcome of this study is the percentage of patients with symptomatic (grade 2 or higher) xerostomia at 1 year post-treatment, assessed by the Late Effects of Normal Tissues (LENT)/Subjective, Objective, Management, Analytic (SOMA) method., 1 year after treatment completion
Exploratory biomarker studies: changes in interleukin 6, Serum baseline levels of interleukin 6 (IL6) and their levels at 3 and 6 months post-treatment., 3 and 6 months post-treatment|Exploratory biomarker studies: changes in vascular endothelial growth factor, Serum baseline levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and their levels at 3 and 6 months post-treatment., 3 and 6 months post-treatment|Exploratory biomarker studies: changes in isoprostanes levels, Baseline urinary levels of isoprostanes before treatment, and 3 and 6 months post-treatment, as a potential marker of oxidative stress associated with chemoradiation., 3 and 6 months post-treatment
Concurrent chemoradiation is the standard of care for locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Improving the outcome for patients with this disease remains a major challenge.
