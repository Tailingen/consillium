Repurposing Chlorpromazine in the Treatment of Glioblastoma
This study evaluates the addition of chlorpromazine to the first-line therapeutic protocol, i.e. maximal well-tolerated surgical resection followed by radiotherapy plus concomitant and adjuvant chemotherapy with temozolomide, in newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme patients carrying a hypo-methylated O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) gene
Glioblastoma Multiforme|MGMT-Unmethylated Glioblastoma
DRUG: Chlorpromazine Pill

Chlorpromazine (CPZ, Largactil, Thorazine) is a potent antagonist of the dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) and has been effectively and safely employed for over half a century in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. CPZ displays a series of remarkable bio-molecular effects in cancer cells, as inhibition of cell growth, nuclear aberrations, inhibition of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/mammilian target of rapamycin (PI3K/mTOR) axis, induction of cytotoxic autophagy, inhibition of glutamate and DRD2 receptors.
