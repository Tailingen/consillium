Pharmacodynamic Study of Radium-223 in Men With Bone Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer
This study will examine biomarkers involved in osteomimicry in bone metastases and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) of men with mCRPC before and during therapy with the bone-targeting radiopharmaceutical radium-223. This study will also examine the bio-distribution of radium-223 in bone and bone metastases of men with mCRPC.

The investigators hypothesize that bone metastases and CTCs in men with mCRPC will commonly express markers of EMT/plasticity and osteomimicry, not just in the normal surrounding osteoblastic stroma but in the epithelial tumor cells themselves and that radium-223 will target both of these compartments including the more mesenchymal/osteoblastic tumor cells and the surrounding osteoblasts in the active bone microenvironment, with a relative sparing of normal bone and bone marrow.
Bone Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer
DEVICE: Biomarker analysis|DRUG: Administration of radium-223
Proportion of patients who overexpress alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) at each time point, The proportion of patients who over-express ALP in the CTCs, defined as any over-expression, will be estimated using descriptive statistics at each time point. ALP expression will be concurrently examined in the bone metastatic biopsies of men as well, if evaluable tissue is available., Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 3 Day 1 and Cycle 6 Day 1 or disease progression
Change in biomarkers of epithelial plasticity and osteomimicry expressed in the bone metastases of men with bone metastatic CRPC, Summary statistics of other biomarkers involved in epithelial plasticity and osteomimicry in the tumor tissue of men with bone metastatic CRPC including expression of ALP, PSA, CK, O-cadherin, N-cadherin, vimentin, TWIST, SNAIL, beta-catenin, ZEB1, androgen receptor (AR), AR variants (ARv) and Î³-H2AX will be completed., At time of optional biopsy, pre- and post-treatment with Radium-223. Post-treatment biopsies will be approximately 10 and 22 weeks after first treatment.
