Y-90, Capecitabine, and Atezolizumab for Oligometastatic CRC
BrUOG-430 is a prospective, single-arm, phase 2 trial evaluating yttrium-90 radioembolization in combination with capecitabine and atezolizumab for the treatment of unresectable colorectal cancer liver metastases in individuals who have been treated with two or more lines of systemic therapy.
Colorectal Carcinoma Metastatic in the Liver
COMBINATION_PRODUCT: yttrium-90 radioembolization
To assess the preliminary efficacy with the combination of yttrium-90, capecitabine, and atezolizumab based on the intrahepatic disease control rate (iDCR) at 12 weeks, Disease control rate is defined as the proportion of patients with complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) within the liver at first post-Y-90 follow-up imaging by NCI's response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST 1.1), which is a standard way to measure if the tumor is responding to treatment by measuring tumor lesions (cm)., 12 weeks
To evaluate the preliminary safety of the combination of yttrium-90, capecitabine, and atezolizumab, Adverse events will be collected (side effects) per the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events CTCAE v5 (adverse events (side effects) are graded from 1-5)., Approximately 18 months|To determine the extrahepatic disease control rate (eDCR) with the combination of yttrium-90, capecitabine, and atezolizumab, assessment of extrahepatic disease control rate (eDCR), measurements from up to three of the target lesions identified outside the liver will be utilized to categorize non-liver response according to NCI's response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST 1.1), which is a standard way to measure if the tumor is responding to treatment by measuring lesions (cm)., Approximately 18 months|To estimate the median overall response rate (ORR), progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) with the combination of yttrium-90, capecitabine, and atezolizumab, CT imaging will be performed beginning on Day 90 (+7 days) or Day 132 (+7 days) depending on if the participant received one or two doses of Y-90, respectively. Subsequently, imaging is to be performed every 90 days (+14 days) until disease progression according to NCI's response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) 1.1, which is a standard way to measure if the tumor is responding to treatment by measuring lesions (cm)., Approximately 18 months
