Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Recurrent Cancer of the Stomach or Esophagus
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in treating patients who have metastatic or recurrent cancer of the stomach or esophagus.
Esophageal Cancer|Gastric Cancer
DRUG: FOLFIRI regimen|DRUG: fluorouracil|DRUG: irinotecan hydrochloride|DRUG: leucovorin calcium
OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate of patients with metastatic or recurrent adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction when treated with irinotecan, fluorouracil, and leucovorin calcium. II. Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicity, and reversibility of toxicity, of this regimen in this patient population.

OUTLINE: Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes, leucovorin calcium IV over 15 minutes, and fluorouracil IV once weekly for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks of rest. Treatment continues every 6 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients are followed at 30 days, and then until death.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-37 patients will be accrued for this study.
