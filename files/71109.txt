Comparison Between Partial Nephrectomy and Ablation for Renal Tumor
The therapeutic effectiveness of ultrasound guided cooled-probe microwave ablation and laparoscopic partial nephrectomy on T1a renal cell carcinoma is compared to find a better approach for renal tumor.
Renal Cell Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: Partial Nephrectomy|PROCEDURE: microwave ablation
overall survival, using log-rank test, 5 years
local tumor progress(new lesion found adjacent to ablation zone), using log-rank test, 5 years|rate of intrarenal metastasis(new lesion found in the treated kidney, but not adjacent to ablation zone), using log-rank test, 5 years|rate of extrarenal metastasis(new lesion found outside of treated kidney), using log-rank test, 5 years|number of patients with side-effect and major complications, using chi-square test, 1 month
