Accumulation of Dietary Bioactives and Prostate Cancer
Current research suggests that diets rich in multiple food types (such as broccoli, onions and garlic) are beneficial to our health and may reduce the risk of some cancers, including prostate cancer. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between ingestion of the bioactive compounds from broccoli and garlic, and prostate metabolism.
