Safety and Efficacy of IMC-C103C as Monotherapy and in Combination With Atezolizumab
IMC-C103C is an immune mobilizing monoclonal T cell receptor against cancer (ImmTAC Â®) designed for the treatment of cancers positive for the tumor-associated antigen MAGE-A4. This is a first-in-human trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IMC-C103C in adult patients who have the appropriate HLA-A2 tissue marker and whose cancer is positive for MAGE-A4.

The IMC-C103C-101 Phase 1/2 study will be evaluated in patients with metastatic/unresectable tumors which include select Advanced Solid Tumors and will be conducted in two phases.

1. To identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or expansion dose of IMC-C103C as a single agent administered intravenously (IV) and subcutaneously (SC) once weekly (Q1W) and administered Q1W in combination with once every 3 weeks (Q3W) atezolizumab.
2. To assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity of IMC-C103C in one or more selected indications, as a single agent administered Q1W.
