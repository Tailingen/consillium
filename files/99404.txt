Study of Combined RHUMAB VEGF and Capecitabine-based Chemoradiation for Patients With Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest safe dose of the drug Bevacizumab that can be given in combination with chemoradiation for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. The effect that this combination treatment has on the tumor will also be studied.
Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Capecitabine|RADIATION: Radiotherapy
Safety of combination Radiation, Bevacizumab, and Capecitabine., 6 weeks after the completion of therapy
To evaluate the local tumor response and median survival in patients treated with the above regimen., 6 weeks after the completion of therapy.|To evaluate VEGF serum levels before and after anti-VEGF therapy., 6 weeks after the completion of therapy.|To evaluate tumor hypoxia via PET scanning (gallium PET with the novel hypoxia tracer Ga-68 ECMN) before, during, and after therapy., 6 weeks after the completion of therapy.|To evaluate quality of life in patients receiving this therapy., 6 weeks after the completion of therapy.
This study administers 50.4 Gy of radiation for unresectable pancreatic cancer with concurrent capecitabine and an experimental drug, Bevacizumab. The drug is an antiangiogenic agent (kills tumor blood vessels) and has been shown in preclinical models to enhance the antitumor effect of radiation and chemotherapy.
