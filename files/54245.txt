Cardiac Safety and Efficacy for Early-stage Breast Cancer Patients Treated With Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin（PLD)
This is a randomized, multicenter, open, controlled Post-Marketing Study. 272 early stage female breast cancer patients who were histopathology confirmed with adjuvant chemotherapy indications were enrolled in this study .The subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups at a 1: 1 ratio, and stratified by trastuzumab,age,baseline cardiac risk factors.
Early Breast Cancer
DRUG: PLD|DRUG: CTX|DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Doxorubicin
cardiotoxity, Congestive heart failure with clinical symptoms, or no symptoms but an abnormal LVEF, 2 years.
5-year DFS, 5-year disease-free survival rate, 5 years|5-year OS, 5-year overall survival rate, 5 years|Adverse events (AE), Incidence and Severity of adverse events according to the CTC AE V4.03, 5 years
Subjects will receive one of two treatment regimens:

Group A: intravenous infusion of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin（PLD） 35 mg/m2, d1; cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2, intravenous infusion, d1; once every 21days, for 4 cycles. Sequential docetaxel 100 mg/m2, intravenous infusion, d1, or paclitaxel 80mg/m2,intravenous infusion, d1,8,15, once every 21 days, for 4 cycles.

Group B: intravenous infusion of doxorubicin 60 mg/m2, d1; cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2, intravenous infusion, d1; sequential docetaxel 100 mg/m2, intravenous infusion, d1, or paclitaxel 80mg/m2,intravenous infusion, d1,8,15, once every 21days, for 4 cycles. The primary endpoint is cardiotoxity,the secondary endpoint is 5-year disease-free survival (DFS), 5-year overall survival (OS), and safety: hematology and non hematological toxicity.
