PI-88 in Hepatocellular Carcinoma After Hepatectomy
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of PI-88 to inhibit or reduce tumor recurrence in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma following hepatectomy.
Carcinoma, Hepatocellular
DRUG: PI-88
Tumour Non-recurrence Rate, The tumor non-recurrence rate at the end of the 48-week study period, Week 48
Time to Recurrence, Time to recurrence during the 48-week study period, until confirmed tumour recurrence, or for a maximum of 48 weeks|Survival Rate, Survival rate at the end of the 48-week study period, Week 48
Although early diagnosis and treatment improve survival, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is rarely cured and recurs frequently after regional therapy or transplantation. Hepatic resection can improve 5-year recurrence-free survival by up to 25%. Micrometastases of HCC have been detected by molecular techniques in 88% of patients at the time of surgery, and probably cause postoperative recurrence. Efforts to reduce the risk of recurrence after a curative resection have been tried, including various regimens of adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy.

In this study , an anti-angiogenic agent, PI-88, is being used as an adjuvant therapy for HCC patients after curative hepatic resection. The efficacy endpoints, including tumour non-recurrence rate, time to first recurrence and 1-year survival rate are being evaluated. Several risk factors associated with tumour recurrence are also being analysed.
