Sorafenib Dose Ramp-Up in Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)
Open-label study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Sorafenib dose ramp-up (starting at a lower dose and then gradually increasing the dose) versus standard Sorafenib dosing in subjects with unresectable and/or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma.

Total (Cumulative) Dose Delivery of Sorafenib, This outcome measure table shows the median cumulative dose delivered to the subjects randomized to the standard dosing regimen (N=63) and ramp-up regimen (N=57) at 4 months of treatment., 4 months-1/12/2010-1/27/14|Cumulative Dose of Sorafenib, Table below shows mean cumulative dose of sorafenib for each of the dosing regimens., 11/22/2010-1/27/14
Safety and Efficacy of Sorafenib Dosing Regimens, Safety of Sorafenib was assessed by the frequency and severity of adverse events according to NCI-CTCAE grading, Baseline-End of Treatment (11/22/2010-3/10/2014)|Safety of Dosing Regimens as Assessed by the Frequency and Severity of Adverse Events According to National Cancer Institute- CTCAE, The total number of CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria) grade 4 adverse events was collected for each dosing regimen beginning at baseline until Week 24/Early Termination Visit., 11/22/2010-3/10/2014|Frequency and Severity of Adverse Events According to National Cancer Institute- CTCAE, The total number of CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria) grade 5 adverse events was collected for each dosing regimen beginning at baseline through 6 months of treatment., 11/22/2010-3/10/2014|Number of Subjects With Dose Interruptions, Baseline-End of Treatment (11/22/2010-3/10/2014)|Number of Subjects With Dose Reductions, 11/22/2010-3/10/2014
This is an open-label study that investigates the impact of a dose ramp-up strategy for sorafenib in patients with HCC. Clinical trial and post-marketing data suggest that sorafenib dose reductions and discontinuations due to adverse events are common and limit the drug's effectiveness. It is our hypothesis that a dose escalation strategy for sorafenib will improve the tolerability and allow a greater percentage of patients to remain on drug. The primary end-point of the study is the total accumulated and median daily dose of sorafenib delivered at month 2 and 4.
