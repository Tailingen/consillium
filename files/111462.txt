Pressure Enabled Intrapancreatic Delivery of SD-101 With Checkpoint Blockade for Locally Advanced Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
This study is an open-label, phase 1/1b study of the pressure-enabled intrapancreatic infusion of SD-101, a TLR 9 agonist, alone or in combination with intravenous checkpoint blockade in adults with locally advanced pancreatic cancer.
Locally Advanced Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: SD-101|BIOLOGICAL: anti-PD-1
Phase 1 - To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or optimal biologic dose (OBD) of SD-101 administered alone via PRVI., As a measure of safety, adverse events will be graded according to CTCAE v5.0, 12 months|Phase 1b - To determine the safety of SD-101 administered via PRVI in combination with anti-PD-1 and to assess the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 disease control rate (DCR), A standard 3+3 dose-escalation design will be employed to determine the MTD or optimal biologic dose., 12 months
Phase 1 - To assess the RECIST v1.1 ORR, As a measure of activity, ORR will be assessed. ORR will be assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) v1.1., 12 months|Phase 1b - To assess the 12-month overall survival (OS) of PRVI of SD-101 in combination with intravenous (IV) immunological checkpoint blockade., As a measure of activity, OS will be assessed. The events for the assessment of 12-month OS are death events., 12 months|Phase 1b - To assess preliminary efficacy in terms of RECIST for immune based therapeutics on ORR., As a measure of activity, iRECIST will be utilized to determine overall response rate (ORR)., 12 months|Phase 1b - To assess preliminary efficacy in terms of RECIST 1.1 pancreatic-specific response rate (PRR)., As a measure of activity, RECIST 1.1 will be utilized to determine pancreatic specific response rate., 12 months|Phase 1b - To assess preliminary efficacy in terms of RECIST 1.1 pancreatic-specific progression free survival (PPFS), As a measure of activity, RECIST 1.1 will be utilized to determine pancreatic specific progression free survival, 12 months|Phase 1b - To assess preliminary efficacy in terms of RECIST for immune based therapeutics on duration of response., As a measure of activity, RECIST 1.1 will be utilized to determine duration of response (DOR), 12 months|Phase 1b - To assess preliminary efficacy in terms of RECIST for immune based therapeutics on clinical benefit ([CR] + [PR] + [SD])., As a measure of activity, RECIST 1.1 will be utilized to determine clinical benefit (complete response \[CR\] + partial response \[PR\] + stable disease \[SD\])., 12 months|Phase 1b - To assess preliminary efficacy in terms of modified RECIST (mRECIST) for immune based therapeutics, As a measure of activity, mRECIST will be utilized to determine overall response rate (ORR)., 12 months|Phase 1b - To assess preliminary efficacy in terms of RECIST 1.1 progression free survival (PFS), As a measure of activity, RECIST 1.1 will be utilized to determine progression free survival (PFS), 12 months
This study will be conducted in 2 phases.

In Phase 1, escalating doses of SD-101 will be administered alone via PRVI into the regional vessels of the pancreas containing the locally advanced tumor. The first three patients will part of a safety run-in. Following determination of the recommended MTD or optimal biologic dose (OBD) of SD-101 for PRVI, the study will progress to

Phase 1b to assess the safety of concomitant SD-101 and CPI usage, along with preliminary efficacy. Patients in Phase 1b will receive the SD-101 dose selected from Phase 1 together with systemic anti-PD-1, defined as any FDA approved anti-PD-1, checkpoint blockade. SD-101 will be administered over 2 cycles, with 1 dose per cycle and each cycle being about 6 weeks apart.
