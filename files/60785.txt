A Study of JNJ-69086420, an Actinium-225-Labeled Antibody Targeting Human Kallikrein-2 (hK2) for Advanced Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose(s) (RP2D\[s\]) of JNJ-69086420 in Part 1 (Dose Escalation), to determine safety and preliminary signs of clinical activity at the RP2D(s) in Part 2 (Dose Expansion), to determine safety of JNJ-69086420 at the RP2D(s) as a combination therapy in Part 3 (combination therapy) and to determine safety of JNJ-69086420 at the RP2D(s) in participants with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) in Part 4.
Prostatic Neoplasms|Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: JNJ-69086420|DRUG: JNJ-78278343|RADIATION: Stereotactic body radiation therapy
Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant participating in a clinical study that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the pharmaceutical/biological agent under study., Up to 2 years and 4 months|Part 1: Number of Participants with Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT), Number of participants with DLT will be assessed. The DLTs are specific adverse events and are defined as any of the following: high grade non-hematologic toxicity, or hematologic toxicity., Up to 2 years and 4 months|Number of Participants with AEs by Severity, Severity will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 5.0. Severity scale ranges from Grade 1 (Mild) to Grade 5 (Death). Grade 1= Mild, Grade 2= Moderate, Grade 3= Severe, Grade 4= Life-threatening and Grade 5= Death related to adverse event., Up to 2 years and 4 months
Percentage of Participants with Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Response, PSA response rate is defined as the percentage of participants with a decline of PSA of 50 percent (%) or more from baseline and that is subsequently confirmed., Up to 2 years and 4 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who have a Partial Response (PR) or better according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 without evidence of bone progression according to Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3)., Up to 2 years and 4 months|Maximum Observed Serum Concentration/Radioactivity (Cmax) of JNJ-69086420, Cmax is defined as the maximum observed serum concentration/radioactivity of JNJ-69086420., Up to 2 years and 4 months|Time to Reach Maximum Observed Serum Concentration/Radioactivity (Tmax) of JNJ-69086420, Tmax is defined as time to reach maximum observed serum concentration/radioactivity of JNJ-69086420., Up to 2 years and 4 months|Area Under the Serum Concentration-time Curve From Time Zero to t Time (AUC[0-t]) of JNJ-69086420, AUC(0-t) is defined as the area under the serum concentration-time curve from time zero to t of JNJ-69086420., Up to 2 years and 4 months|Number of Participants With Anti-JNJ-69086420 Antibodies, Number of participants with anti-JNJ-69086420 antibodies will be assessed to evaluate the potential immunogenicity., Up to 2 years and 4 months|Part 3: Serum Concentration of JNJ-78278343, Venous blood samples will be collected for assessment of serum concentrations of JNJ-78278343., Up to 2 years and 4 months|Part 3:Number of Participants With Anti-JNJ-78278343 Antibodies, Number of participants with anti-JNJ-78278343 antibodies will be assessed to evaluate the potential immunogenicity., Up to 2 years and 4 months
