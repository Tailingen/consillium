Number of participants with ADA confirmed positive to enapotamab vedotin is reported., Day 1 through Day 1130 (Dose-escalation part: Predose of Day 1 of Cycles 1 to 12, end of treatment [EOT], and 30 days after last study drug; Expansion part: Predose on Day 1 of Cycles 1 to 5, then every fourth cycle until PD)|Number of Participants With Objective Response (OR) Based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) As Assessed by Investigator, Radiological evaluation based on RECIST v1.1 was performed by the investigator using computed tomography (CT) scans/ magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans/ positron emission tomography (PET) scans. The OR was defined as confirmed CR or confirmed PR per RECIST v1.1. The changes in tumor measurements that were confirmed by repeat assessments performed no less than 4 weeks after initial response are called confirmed responses. The CR was defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and all pathological lymph nodes must have decreased to \< 10 mm in short axis.

A CA-125 partial response was defined as at least a 50% reduction in CA-125 levels in blood from a pretreatment sample. Participants who had a CA-125 partial response and had CA-125 level falls to within the reference range (0-35 units/mL) were classified as CA-125 complete responders. The response was confirmed and maintained for at least 28 days. The best overall response (CA-125 partial response and CA-125 complete response) is reported., From Screening (within 2 weeks before starting of the study treatment) through Day 1130 (maximum observed duration)|Duration of Response (DoR) Based on RECIST v1.1 as Assessed by Investigator for Expansion Part, The DoR was defined as the number of months from the first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR) to the date of first progressive disease (PD) or death. The OR was defined as confirmed CR or confirmed PR per RECIST v1.1. The changes in tumor measurements that were confirmed by repeat assessments performed no less than 4 weeks after initial response are called confirmed responses. The CR was defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and all pathological lymph nodes must have decreased to \< 10 mm in short axis. The PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum of LD.

The PFS was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method., Day 1 through 44.5 months (maximum observed duration)|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival was defined as the number of months from date of first study drug administration to death. The OS was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method., Day 1 through 44.5 months (maximum observed duration)|Change in AXL Expression (Total Tumor H-score) From Baseline to EOT Visit for Expansion Part, Change in AXL expression (total humor H-score in membrane or cytoplasm) from Baseline to EOT visit for the expansion part is reported. The H-score captures both the intensity and proportion of AXL positive tumor cells and was defined by the formula: H-score = (1 × % 1+ tumor cells) + (2 × % 2+ tumor cells) + (3 × % 3+ tumor cells); where '1+' indicates weak staining intensity, '2+' indicates medium staining intensity, and '3+' indicates strong staining intensity. The H-score values ranges from 0 to 300. Lower H-scores represent lower AXL expression in the tumor sample, while higher scores represent stronger AXL expression in the tumor samples., Baseline (Study Days -21 to 1) and EOT visit (Day 1100)
The trial consists of two parts; a dose escalation part (phase I, first in-human (FIH)) and an expansion part (phase IIa).

The dose escalation part has 2 dosing schedules: 1 dose every 3 weeks (1Q3W) dose regimen, and 3 doses every 4 weeks (3Q4W) dosing regimen.

The Expansion part of the trial will further explore the recommended phase 2 dose and dosing regimens of HuMax-AXL-ADC as determined in dose escalation part.
