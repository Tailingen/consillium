HAIC Combined With Anlotinib and TQB2450 as Adjuvant Therapy in HCC Patients With High Risk of Recurrence After Resection
This is a single center, non-randomized, open, multi-cohort clinical, exploratory Phase II study, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of HAIC combined with TQB2450 and anlotinib as adjuvant therapy in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients at high risk of recurrence after resection.

The high incidence of HCC recurrence following liver resection is a serious issue. However, no adjuvant therapy has been widely recognized at present. Interventional therapy and systemic drug therapy are common treatment methods and effective treatment for liver cancer. The combination of multiple drugs may reduce the recurrence in HCC patients with high-risk recurrence. TQB2450 is a humanized monoclonal antibody of programmed death-ligand1 (PD-L1), enabling T cells to restore immune activity and thus enhance the immune response. Anlotinib is a novel multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) for tumor angiogenesis and proliferative signaling.
