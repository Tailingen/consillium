A Phase 2, Open-label, Single-arm Study of Autologous M-CENK Adoptive Cell Therapy and N-803 (IL-15 Superagonist) in Combination with Gemcitabine in Participants with Recurrent Platinum-Resistant High-Grade Ovarian Cancer
This is phase 2 single arm study evaluating the safety and preliminary efficacy of M-CENK adoptive cell therapy and fixed dose of N-803 in combination with gemcitabine in participants with platinum-resistant high-grade ovarian cancer (HGOC).Up to 20 participants will receive M-CENK (IV) and N-803 (SC) in combination with gemcitabine (IV).

Participants will undergo an apheresis procedure for the collection of mononuclear cells (MNCs) at least 1 day prior to Cycle 1 for manufacturing of M-CENK. Starting in Cycle 1, participants will receive gemcitabine and starting in Cycle 2 they will also receive M-CENK and N-803, until no additional M-CENK is available or confirmed PD per iRECIST, unless the participant is potentially deriving benefit per Investigator's assessment.

Participants who complete the study treatment or discontinue study treatment will be followed for survival/disease status every 12 weeks (± 2 weeks) for up to 12 months after the last study treatment or until death, lost to follow-up, or withdrawal of consent.

Safety: Evaluate adverse events, Apheresis to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment or the end of treatment visit, up to 13 months|Safety: Incidence of clinically significant changes in comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), Standard blood chemistry panel made up of 14 separate chemistry measurements so can detect a range of abnormalities in blood sugar, nutrient balance, and liver and kidney health. Each clinical site will use their local laboratory upper limit of normal (ULN) range. The treating investigator will assess each result composing the CMP and determine if each result is within expected normal range or outside of the expected normal range., Screening through Follow-up, up to 2 years|Safety: Incidence of clinically significant changes in Hematology blood panel, Blood test checking the levels for White Blood Cell, Red Blood Cell, Platelets, Hemoglobin, Hematocrit, Basophils, Eosinophils, Lymphocytes, Monocytes and Neutrophils per unit volume. Each clinical site will use their local laboratory upper limit of normal (ULN) range. The treating investigator will assess each component of the Hematology panel and determine if each result is within expected normal range or outside of the expected normal range., Screening through Follow-up, up to 2 years|Safety: Incidence of clinically significant changes in Temperature, Temperature measured in either Fahrenheit or Celsius and for any abnormalities. Each site will assess to determine if temperature is within expected normal range or outside of the expected normal range., Screening through Follow-up, up to 2 years|Safety: Incidence of clinically significant changes in Heart Rate, Heart rate measured in beats/minute. Each site will assess to determine if heart rate is within expected normal range or outside of the expected normal range., Screening through Follow-up, up to 2 years|Safety: Incidence of clinically significant changes in Respiratory Rate, Respiratory rate measured in breaths/minute. Each site will assess to determine if respiratory rate is within expected normal range or outside of the expected normal range., Screening through Follow-up, up to 2 years|Safety: Incidence of clinically significant changes in Blood Pressure, Blood pressure measured in Systolic and Diastolic mmHg. Each site will assess to determine if blood pressure is within expected normal range or outside of the expected normal range., Screening through Follow-up, up to 2 years|Safety: Incidence of clinically significant changes in Oxygen Saturation, A pulse oximeter measures oxygen saturation as a percentage. Determines the ratio of the current levels of oxygenated hemoglobin to deoxygenated hemoglobin. Each site will assess to determine if oxygen saturation is within expected normal range or outside of the expected normal range., Screening through Follow-up, up to 2 years
Exploratory: Evaluate the number and phenotype of M-CENK cells performed by flow cytometry and mass cytometry (CyTOF)., During M-CENK production between Apheresis and Cycle 2 Day 1, up to 2 months|Exploratory: Characterize the functionality of M-CENK cells as measured by intracellular staining for cytokines, surface marker staining, and assessments of cytotoxicity., During M-CENK production between Apheresis and Cycle 2 Day 1, up to 2 months|Exploratory: Assess serum cytokine levels before and after M-CENK infusions., Cycle 2 Day 1 through last dose of M-CENK, up to 13 months
