Exploring the Tumor Micro-Environment with 68Ga-FAPi-46 PET/CT in Breast Cancer
This study is a prospective, non-interventional, open-label study to evaluate the glucose metabolism and the expression of the imaging agent 68 Gallium-Fibroblast Activation Protein Inhibitor-46 (68Ga-FAPi-46) with PET imaging, in woman affected by Breast Cancer (BC) and referred to diagnostic imaging work-up prior to primary therapy.
Breast Cancer Invasive|Node Positive Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: 68Ga-FAPi-46 PET/CT
Comparison of 68Ga-FAPi PET/CT and 18F-FDG PET/CT positivity rate, Comparison of 68Ga-FAPi PET/CT and 18F-FDG PET/CT of positivity rate (percentage of detection of metastatic patients), 3 months
All patients affected by newly diagnosed, clinically N-positive BC that have already undergone a baseline 2-deoxy-2-\[fluorine-18\]fluoro-D-glucose (18F-FDG) PET/CT (T1) will be screened for eligibility. Patients who will meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria will be considered eligible and asked to participate to the study after signing the informed consent form. Patients' eligibility will be evaluated by the referent nuclear medicine physician (T2). Considering the clinical experience of the investigators, we expect to complete patient enrolment in 12 months after study accrual
