The goal of this clinical trial is to test in Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer patients with EGFR Mutations. The main question it aims to answer is:

Evaluation of the Efficacy and Safety of Aumolertinib in Combination with Lastet for the Treatment of EGFR-Mutated Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer in First-line Therapy.

Participants will be treated with a combination of Aumolertinib and Lastet.
Lung Cancer Non-small Cell Stage IV
DRUG: Almonertinib
Progression-Free Survival, PFS is defined as the period from the start of treatment until the disease progresses or the patient dies from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months, up to 24 months
Disease Control Rate, Disease Control Rate (DCR) is to describe the proportion of patients who have achieved a response to treatment that includes not only complete and partial responses but also stable disease., 24 months|Duration of Response, The Duration of Response (DoR) is a clinical measure to determine the length of time that a tumor continues to respond to treatment without the cancer worsening., 24 months|Objective Response Rate, The Objective Response Rate (ORR) is a key metric used in oncology to assess the proportion of patients in a study or treatment group who achieve an objective response (CR or PR)., 24 months|Overall Survival, OS is measured from the date of the initiation of treatment to the date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months, up to 24 months
