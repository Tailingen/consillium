Study of PEGPH20 With Initial Dexamethasone Premedication Given Intravenously to Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study in patients with advanced solid tumors.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: PEGPH20
Maximally Tolerated Dose (MTD) of PEGPH20 when given to patients with cancer, The PEGPH20 monotherapy MTD is the highest dose at which no more than one of six evaluable patients experience Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT), To be evaluable for MTD determination, a patient must have completed the Cycle 1 study drug doses and the associated assessments for safety and toxicity evaluation|Safety endpoints including assessment of both serious and non-serious AEs, All safety data will be evaluated using the NCI CTCAE scoring system (version 4.0), From Day 1 of Treatment Cycle 1, thru to Follow-up (within 28 days after last dose of PEGPH20)
A study of PEGylated recombinant human hyaluronidase (PEGPH20) administered on a twice weekly schedule for 28 days followed by a weekly dosing schedule in patients with advanced solid tumors who have either failed to respond to standard therapy or for whom no standard therapy exists.
