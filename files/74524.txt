Metformin Plus Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Breast Cancer
Background Obesity and overweight are well known risk factors for breast cancer and also are associated with higher recurrence and mortality rates.

Main goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of metformin plus chemotherapy in terms of pathologic complete response in comparison with placebo plus the same chemotherapy regimen Design: Randomized, double blind, clinical trial. This study will be performed at National Cancer Institute of Mexico City, at breast cancer unit.

Patients with ER+ or PR+, HER2 negative, breast cancer are candidates to participate.

After completion of chemotherapy all patients will have a breast surgery to assess pathologic response.

Complete pathologic response is defined as the abscence of malignant cells in breast tissue and lymph nodes. The presence of DCIS is considered as pCR
Locally Advanced Malignant Neoplasm
DRUG: Metformin
pathologic complete response, to assess the efficacy in terms of pahtologic complete response in patients with locally advanced breast cancer, treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy based on Paclitaxel followed by FAC, combined with metformin or placebo, pCR will be assesed after 24 weeks of treatment
Safety analysis, For safety analysis we are going to use NCTC criteria version 3.0, after 24 treatment weeks'|Assess clinical response at the end of paclitaxel and at the end of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, tumor measurements by caliper every cycle and by ultrasound at the end of chemotherapy, after 24 treatment weeks'|To correlate serum levels of insulin, protein C and HbA1 (after treatment) with clinical and pathologic response, correlation between serum levels of insuline levels, HbA1 and PCR and PCR, safter 24 treatment weeks'
Definitions Luminal A: tumors ER + PR + HER2 Negative and Ki67 \<14% Luminal B: tumors ER +/-, PR +/-, HER2 negative and Ki67 \>15% Complete pathologic response is defined as the abscence of malignant cells in breast tissue and lymph nodes. The presence of DCIS is considered as pCR
