Effect of Tivantinib on the QTC Interval in Cancer Subjects
The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of tivantinib on the QTc interval in patients with solid tumors
Solid Tumors
DRUG: Tivantinib|DRUG: Placebo
The time-matched difference in the QTcF interval at each timepoint after both single and multiple doses of tivantinib compared with placebo, Triplicate ECG measurements of the QTc interval will be taken at Screening (4 sets each 1 hour apart) and pre-dose and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours post dose on Days 1, 2, and 5 (+3 days), Baseline and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours post dose on Days 1, 2, and 5 (+3 days)
Estimated change in baseline adjusted QT, corrected QT interval (QTcB), individually corrected QT interval (QTcI) (if possible), heart rate, PR, QRS, & RR intervals at timepoints after both single and multiple doses of tivantinib compared with placebo, Triplicate ECG measurements of the QTc interval will be taken at Screening (4 sets each 1 hour apart) and pre-dose and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours post dose on Days 1, 2, and 5 (+3 days), Baseline and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours post dose on Days 1, 2, and 5 (+3 days)|Plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of tivantinib and major metabolites of tivantinib after both single and multiple doses of tivantinib., Blood samples for PK analysis will be obtained within 15 minutes following each pre-specified ECG measurement, Baseline and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours post dose on Days 1, 2, and 5 (+3 days)|Explore the tivantinib plasma concentration-QTc interval relationship, Triplicate ECG measurements of the QTc interval will be taken at Screening (4 sets each 1 hour apart) and pre-dose and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours post dose on Days 1, 2, and 5 (+3 days). Blood samples for PK analysis will be obtained within 15 minutes following each pre-specified ECG measurement. The relationship between plasma concentrations of tivantinib and the change from baseline in QTc will be quantified using a linear random coefficient regression model approach., Baseline and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours post dose on Days 1, 2, and 5 (+3 days)
The study is designed to estimate the maximum change in QTcF (change from baseline) between placebo and multiple-dose tivantinib. A tivantinib oral dose of 360 mg BID has been selected for this study because this is the highest dose currently being evaluated in clinical studies.
