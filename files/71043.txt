SCH 54031 PEG12000 Interferon Alfa-2b (PEG Intron, MK-4031) vs. INTRON®A (SCH 30500, MK-2958) as Adjuvant Therapy for Melanoma (C98-135, MK-4031-002)
This is a Phase II/III randomized, controlled, multicenter, open-label study designed to assess the safety, efficacy, and impact on quality of life of PEG Intron (MK-4031) and INTRON® A (MK-2958) and the pharmacokinetics of PEG Intron when given as adjuvant (after surgery) therapy in participants with resected (surgically removed) Stage III node-positive cutaneous melanoma.

Progression-free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival time was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of disease progression or the date of death regardless of the cause. PFS was to be assessed by clinical observation, with recurrence documented by appropriate radiographic and histologic methods, and confirmed by Independent Central Review., From time of randomization to time of progression or death (up to approximately 26 months)
Overall Survival, Overall survival (OS) is the time from randomization to death due to any cause. Participants were to be followed for survival every 3 months. Participants without documented death at the time of the final analysis were to be censored at the date of the last follow-up. After the early termination of the study, participants were followed for safety only. Although the OS analysis is not in the clinical study report due to early termination of the study, an OS ad hoc analysis was requested by the FDA and is therefore presented in this outcome measure. Below table presents the median duration of survival for participants., From time of randomization to time of death (up to approximately 26 months)
This study was closed to enrollment prematurely due to sub-optimal accrual. Participants who were enrolled prior to enrollment closure were allowed to continue to receive study drug; these participants were followed for safety only.
