cSMART Liquid Biopsy and Dynamic Monitor of NSCLC Patients in Inner-Mongolia China
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the mutation pattern of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and other TKI targeted gene during TKI treatment of advanced NSCLC patient with liquid biopsy.
Nonsmall Cell Lung Cancer|Adenocarcinoma
The TKI resistance gene mutation pattern in plasma DNA of TKI treated patient, The researcher would like to find out the change of mutation in plasma DNA of the patients who received TKI treatment by a liquid biopsy method., 1.5 years
The concordance of gene mutation pattern between liquid biopsy and traditional cancer tissue biopsy, 1 year
In the study, 200 advanced NSCLC patients will be recruited. All the patients will receive biopsy genotype assay and Circulating Single-Molecule Amplification and Resequencing Technology (cSMART) liquid biopsy. those patients who carry EGFR activating mutation and other TKI targeted activating mutation will receive TKI treatment. During the TKI treatment, every patients will take liquid biopsy assay to monitor the mutation status. the study will be ended when all the patients had a progressive disease (PD) in their targeted lesion
