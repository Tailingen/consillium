Lentiviral Gene Therapy (Zamtocabtagene Autoleucel) LTFU
This is an observational long-term follow-up (LTFU) study for subjects who previously received zamtocabtagene autoleucel, known as MB-CART2019.1.
Non Hodgkin Lymphoma
OTHER: Long-term Follow-Up
The incidence of serious and non serious adverse events of special interest, AESIs will be collected, Up to 15 years
Number of subjects with measurable replication competent lentivirus in peripheral blood (if positive at study entry), Peripheral blood samples may be collected for RCL assessment, Up to 15 years|Duration of zamtocabtagene autoleucel persistence, Peripheral blood samples will be collected to test for CAR T cells, Up to 5 years|Objective response rate, ORR, Up to 15 years|Overall Survival, OS, Up to 15 years
This is a non-therapeutic study design. After successful screening, subjects will be monitored for potential gene therapy-related adverse events for up to 15 years post MB-CART2019.1 infusion. Subjects will be assessed yearly for the occurrence of delayed adverse events (AEs), monitored for replication competent lentivirus (RCL) and assessed for long term efficacy as well as CAR-T persistence.
