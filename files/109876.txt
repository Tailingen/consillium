Preliminary Study on the Metastatic Rate and Clinical Significance of the Anterior Leaf of Vesicouterine Ligament in Early Stage Cervical Cancer
The purpose of this study is to preliminarily explore the metastatic rate and clinical significance of the anterior leaf of vesicouterine ligament resection for early stage cervical cancer, so as to further improve the postoperative quality of life of patients and reduce the incidence of postoperative urinary complications.
Cervical Cancer
PROCEDURE: Type B resection or type C resection of the anterior leaf of vesicouterine ligament during the radical hysterectomy (type C)
Metastatic rate of the anterior leaf of vesicouterine ligament, The metastasis rate of anterior leaf of VUL (%) = (case number of positive metastatic lesion detected by H\&E staining + case number of positive metastatic lesion diagnosed by "ultrastaging") / Total number of the patients with cervical cancer who underwent abdominal radical hysterectomy（type C）plus pelvic lymph node dissection by the samesurgical team ×100%, 1 year (Postoperative pathological confirmation date)
Incidence of postoperative adjuvant therapy in patients with metastasis in the anterior leaf of VUL, Clinical data, 1 year after surgery|Incidence of postoperative urinary dysfunction in two groups, Follow-up and subjective description, 1 year after surgery|Postoperative quality of life scores in two groups, The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cervical（FACT-Cx）cervical cancer patient quality of life score table, 1，2，3 years after surgery|DFS, Disease-free survival, 3 years after surgery
The patients with cervical cancer who underwent abdominal radical hysterectomy（type C）plus pelvic lymph node dissection by the same surgical team at the Department of Gynecological Oncology, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, were included. According to the resection range of the anterior leaf of vesicouterine ligament (VUL), patients were divided into type C resection group (near the bladder wall) and B type resection group (above the ureter). The anterior leaf of the VUL in the type C resection group was sent to pathological biopsy separately, and the metastasis rate was further clarified by the pathological "ultrastaging" method. By comparing the clinicopathological characteristics of patients with metastasis and non-metastasis, the potential risk factors of VUL metastasis were analyzed. The oncological outcomes of patients with different resection range of the anterior VUL were compared. At the same time, the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cervical（FACT-Cx）cervical cancer patient quality of life score table was used to evaluate cervical cancer patients after surgery. The relevant factors that may affect the quality of life score are included in the multiple linear regression analysis to obtain independent risk factors that affect the quality of life of the patient after surgery.
