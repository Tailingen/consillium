Role of Methylation Test Triage in HPV Positive Women
The pathological results were used as the gold standard in this study and the investigators analyze the diagnostic value of six gene methylation status (ASTN1 DLX1, ITGA4, RXFP3, SOX17, ZNF671) in triaging high-risk human papillomavirus infection. The sensitivity and specificity of methylation test and cytology in the diagnosis of high-grade cervical lesions are compared in order to providing new methods and basis in improving the accuracy of cervical cancer screening.
Precancerous Cervical Lesion
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Methylation Test
The sensitivity and specificity of methylation test in detecting CIN2+., The primary variable of methylation test are as follows:clinical sensitivity, clinical specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, positive coincidence rate, and negative coincidence rate., From date of enrollment until the date of first documented CIN2+,assessed up to 12 months
KAPPA value of methylation test., KAPPA value is the secondary variable of methylation test which need to meet statistical criteria., From date of enrollment until the date of first documented CIN2+,assessed up to 12 months
The study is divided into two phases, a baseline (cross-sectional) phase and a 1-year follow-up phase. Women who meet the clinical endpoint (i.e. histopathologically confirmed â‰¥CIN2 after baseline colposcopy/biopsy) are withdrawn from the study. Participants who do not meet the primary endpoint/treat at baseline will invited to participate in the follow-up phase of the trial. Participants included in the follow-up phase are underwent HPV, cytology, and methylation tests at 6 months and 1 year after baseline.Similar to the baseline phase,participants were referred to colposcopy/biopsy if any of the cytology and HPV tests result is positive.
