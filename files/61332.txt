Tailoring NEOadjuvant Therapy in Hormone Receptor Positive, HER2 Negative, Luminal Breast Cancer.
The aim of this prospective, randomized, multicenter, open-label, phase II study is to test if chemotherapy can be replaced by the combination of ribociclib plus letrozole as a neo-adjuvant therapy for patients with non-metastatic primary luminal breast cancer.

DRUG: Letrozole|DRUG: Chemotherapy|DRUG: Ribociclib plus letrozole
Difference in complete cell cycle arrest (CCCA; defined as Ki67 IHC <1%) between ribociclib plus letrozole and chemotherapy in the surgical specimen., Determine if ribociclib plus letrozole gives a ≥100% improvement in CCCA as compared to chemotherapy in the surgical specimen., CCCA will be determined in the surgical specimen, which is around 7 months after start of initial letrozole treatment.
Correlation between Ki67 IHC scored manually, IHC scored automatically (Vectra ® 3) and Ki67 mRNA., The correlation between the different Ki67 measurements will be determined in the primary core biopsy, two weeks biopsy and surgical specimen., Ki67 measurements will be done in the primary core biopsy (baseline), two weeks biopsy (done after two weeks of initial letrozole treatment) and the surgical specimen (which is around 7 months after start of initial letrozole treatment).|Correlation between ER pathway activity at baseline, after two weeks letrozole and at surgery and clinical outcome., The ER pathway activity will be determined in the primary core biopsy, two weeks biopsy and surgical specimen and then correlated with clinical outcome.

Activity will be determined using a Bayesian network model of the ER transcriptional program, which interprets the pathway target genes' mRNA levels (from Affymetrix HG-U133Plus2.0 arrays) and infers a probability that the ER pathway is active in a certain sample., ER pathway activity will measured in the primary core biopsy (baseline), two weeks biopsy (done after two weeks of initial letrozole treatment) and the surgical specimen (which is around 7 months after start of initial letrozole treatment).|Difference in pathologic response (pCR and response according to Miller and Payne) between the randomized study arms., The pathologic response will be determined in the surgical specimen of the patients in the randomized study arms where after the difference between the two groups can be determined., pCR and response according to Miller and Payne will be determined in the surgical specimen, which is around 7 months after start of initial letrozole treatment.|Change in tumor biology and biomarkers (ER, PR, HER2, Rb, Ki67) at baseline, after 2 weeks letrozole and at surgery., Tumor biology and biomarkers will be determined in the primary core biopsy, two weeks biopsy and surgical specimen, where after the change in tumor biology and biomarkers over time can be determined., Tumor biology and biomarkers will be assessed in the primary core biopsy (baseline), two weeks biopsy (done after two weeks of initial letrozole treatment) and the surgical specimen (which is around 7 months after start of initial letrozole treatment).|Toxicity according to NCI CTCAE v4.03 all grades and grade III/IV., Toxicities are graded according to NCI CTCAE v4.03., Toxicity will be assessed from start treatment up to 30 days following the last dose of treatment.|Correlation of tumor measurements between standard MRI (using RECIST 1.1) and palpation (largest diameter in cm) at baseline, after AC/before T or 8 weeks of definitive neoadjuvant therapy and pre-surgery., The correlation of tumor measurements between MRI and palpation will be determined at three different time points., Tumor measurements (MRI and palpation) will be performed at baseline, after AC/before T or 8 weeks of definitive neoadjuvant therapy and pre-surgery (which is around 7 months after start of initial letrozole treatment).|Descriptive analysis of event free survival (EFS) at 3 and 5 years., EFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first date of local, regional, or distant relapse, second primary invasive breast cancer including contralateral breast cancer, progression according to RECIST 1.1 or death due to any cause which ever occurred first., EFS will be determined after 3 and 5 years.|Descriptive analysis of overall survival (OS) at 3 and 5 years., OS is defined as the time from randomization to date of death., Time Frame: OS will be determined after 3 and 5 years.
Change in ERα DNA binding signatures (Chip-seq) between baseline and after 2 weeks letrozole., ERα DNA binding will be determined in the primary core biopsy and two weeks biopsy, where after the change in these measurements over time can be determined., ERα DNA binding signatures will be assessed in the primary core biopsy (baseline) and the two weeks biopsy (done after two weeks of initial letrozole treatment).|Change in gene expression profiles (RNA-seq) between baseline and after 2 weeks letrozole., Gene expression profiling will be determined in the primary core biopsy and two weeks biopsy, where after the change in these measurements over time can be determined., Gene expression profiles will be assessed in the primary core biopsy (baseline) and the two weeks biopsy (done after two weeks of initial letrozole treatment).
Based on Ki67 levels after two weeks of initial letrozole treatment in postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative, stage II/III breast cancer, patients are either advised to continue letrozole treatment (if Ki67 \<1%) or will be randomized between standard chemotherapy (AC-T) or ribociclib in combination with letrozole (if Ki67 ≥1%).
