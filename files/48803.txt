High-dose Furmonertinib Versus Osimertinib in Advanced EGFRm NSCLC Patients With Brain Metastases
The investigators were to explore whether high-dose Furmonertinib, compared with osimertinib, could achieve longer survival in patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC with CNS metastasis.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer incidence and death worldwide. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for about 80-85%, and EGFR mutations occur in about 45-55% of the Asian population. In newly diagnosed NSCLC patients, the rate of brain metastases in advanced NSCLC can be as high as 25% to 44%. The brain metastasis rate of advanced lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR mutation can reach 60%. For NSCLC patients with CNS metastases and EGFR mutations, the PFS of EGFR-TKIs was improved compared with chemotherapy, but neither was satisfactory, even with Osimertinib (third-generation EGFR-TKI). The PFS of patients with CNS metastases treated with Osimertinib was only 15.23 months. Therefore, the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer patients with brain metastases is still a difficult problem to improve the long-term survival rate of lung cancer. Clinical data and early preclinical studies have shown that Furmonertinib(AST2818) can effectively inhibit the classical mutation of EGFR, especially for intracranial lesions, and is well tolerated. In the FURLONG study, the PFS of patients with CNS metastases was 20.8 months and the ORR were 91%, respectively. This may be due to the unique molecular structure of Furmonertinib, which has the advantage of "double entry into the brain". Furthermore, the investigators' previous research showed that patients treated with 160mg of Furmonertinib after third-generation EGFR-TKIs treatment resistance were divided into intracranial progression mode group and extracranial progression mode group, and finally proven that Furmonertinib 160mg with or without antiangiogenic agents could be an option for patients with advanced NSCLC who have developed resistance after third-generation EGFR-TKIs, especially those who have developed resistance due to intracranial lesion progression. Based on above, the investigators propose to develop a multi-center, randomized, controlled, prospective, Phase II clinical trial in order to explore whether high-dose Furmonertinib could achieve longer survival in patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC with CNS metastasis, particularly long-term control of intracranial lesions.
