Amifostine Followed by High Dose Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Hematologic Cancer or Solid Tumors
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Chemoprotective drugs such as amifostine may protect normal cells from the side effects of chemotherapy.

PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of amifostine followed by high-dose chemotherapy in treating patients with hematologic cancer or solid tumors.

BIOLOGICAL: sargramostim|DRUG: amifostine trihydrate|DRUG: cisplatin|DRUG: cyclophosphamide|DRUG: etoposide
duration of neutropenia, number of days absolute neutrophil count less than 500 during the nadir period after administration of high dose chemotherapy, 30 days
incidence of nephrotoxicity, decrease in creatinine clearance from baseline after high dose chemotherapy, 30 days|incidence of ototoxicity, change in audiogram from baseline after high dose chemotherapy, 30 days
OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the efficacy of amifostine in enhancing hematopoietic recovery following cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and cisplatin therapy in patients with hematologic malignancies and adult solid tumors.

OUTLINE: This is an open label study. Patients receive intravenous amifostine over 15 minutes daily 30 minutes prior to high dose chemotherapy on days 0-2. Cyclophosphamide is administered over 3 hours on days 0 and 1, intravenous etoposide over 4 hours on days 0, 1, and 2, and cisplatin over 4 hours on days 0, 1, and 2. All patients receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) beginning on day 4. Patients receive a maximum of 2 courses of treatment (with 35-42 days between chemotherapy courses). Patients are followed for 1-5 months after treatment.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20 patients will be accrued for this study within 12 months.
