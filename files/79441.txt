A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Tolerability of Immunotherapy Combinations in Participants With Advanced Malignancies
This is a Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation and dose-expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD) and clinical activity of etrumadenant (AB928) in combination with zimberelimab (AB122) (an anti-PD-1 antibody) in participants with advanced malignancies.

Percentage of participants with Adverse Events, Safety will be assessed by monitoring adverse events and clinically relevant changes in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, 12 lead Electrocardiogram (ECG), vital signs, physical examination and clinical laboratory results., From first dose date to 90 days after the last dose (approximately 3 years)|Percentage of participants who experience a Dose Limiting Toxicity, From first study treatment administration through Day 28
Etrumadenant Peak Serum Concentration: Cmax, Recorded at baseline (screening), during the first 4 cycles of treatment (4 months) and 30 and 90 days post last dose (approximately 7 months)|Zimberelimab Peak Serum Concentration: Cmax, Recorded at baseline (screening), during the first 4 cycles of treatment (4 months) and 30 and 90 days post last dose (approximately 7 months)|Etrumadenant Time of Peak Concentration: Tmax, Recorded at baseline (screening), during the first 4 cycles of treatment (4 months) and 30 and 90 days post last dose (approximately 7 months)|Zimberelimab Time of Peak Concentration: Tmax, Recorded at baseline (screening), during the first 4 cycles of treatment (4 months) and 30 and 90 days post last dose (approximately 7 months)|Percentage of participants with anti-drug antibodies to zimberelimab, Recorded at baseline (screening), during the first 4 cycles of treatment (4 months), at end of treatment, and 30 and 90 days post last dose (approximately 7 months)|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS as determined by Investigator according to Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) for prostate adenocarcinoma and per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 for all other tumor types, From start of treatment up to the first occurrence of progressive disease or death from any cause (approximately 1-3 years)|Overall Survival (OS), OS as determined by the Investigator according to PCWG3 for prostate adenocarcinoma and per RECIST v1.1 for all other tumor types, From study start of treatment up to death from any cause (approximately 1-3 years)|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR as determined by the Investigator according to PCWG3 for prostate adenocarcinoma and per RECIST v1.1 for all other tumor types, From the date of first occurrence of a documented objective response to first documentation of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (approximately 1-3 years)|Percentage of Participants with Disease Control, Disease Control (complete response, partial response, or stable disease) for \>6 months as determined by the Investigator per PCWG3 for prostate adenocarcinoma and per RECIST v1.1 for all other tumor types, From study enrolment until disease progression or loss of clinical benefit (approximately 1-3 years)|Percentage of participants with Objective Response, Objective Response as determined by Investigator according to PCWG3 for prostate adenocarcinoma and per RECIST v1.1 for all other tumor types, From study enrolment until participant discontinuation, first occurrence of progressive disease, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (approximately 1-3 years)
In the dose-escalation phase, escalating doses of etrumadenant in combination with zimberelimab will be assessed in participants with advanced malignancies. Eligible participants will receive oral administration of etrumadenant as well as IV infusion of zimberelimab. The recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of etrumadenant will be determined upon completion of the dose-escalation phase.

In the dose-expansion phase, etrumadenant at RP2D in combination with zimberelimab may be assessed in participants with advanced clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) or metastatic castrate-resistant adenocarcinoma of the prostate (mCRPC).

Overall duration of treatment will depend on how well the treatment is tolerated. Treatment may continue until unacceptable toxicity or progressive disease or other reasons specified in the protocol.
