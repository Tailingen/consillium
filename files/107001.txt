Copper Cu 64 TP3805 PET in Detecting Prostate Cancer in Patients With Persistently Elevated PSA
This pilot phase I trial studies how well copper Cu 64 TP3805 positron emission tomography (PET) works in detecting prostate cancer in patients with persistently elevated prostate specific antigen (PSA). The copper Cu 64 TP3805 PET scan uses copper Cu 64 TP3805, a compound made of a radioactive agent attached to a molecule that looks like a hormone that binds to cancer cells to detect prostate cancer during PET scans. Copper Cu 64 TP3805 PET may be able to see tumors at an earlier stage than the standard of care.
Prostate Cancer
RADIATION: Copper Cu 64 TP3805|PROCEDURE: Positron Emission Tomography and Computed Tomography Scan
Prostate Cancer Detection Within the Prostate Gland by Copper Cu 64 TP3805 PET, The proportion of participants with lesions detected with copper Cu-64 PET will be determined with the lesion as the unit of analysis. 95% confidence intervals will be calculated., At 3 weeks post imaging visit
Total Incidence of Multiple Lesions in an Individual Patient, Generalized Estimating Equations will be utilized to provide a total number of lesions, At 3 weeks post imaging procedure
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To assess the ability of Cu-64-TP3805 (copper Cu 64 TP3805) to detect prostate cancer (PC), or absence thereof, within the prostate gland.
