Evaluation of a 3-D Tomosynthesis Mammography System Used in Conjunction With Conventional 2-D Digital Mammography
This was a multi-center, prospective clinical trial in which the subject was her own control. Approximately 950-1400 female subjects were enrolled at five (5) sites in the United States. Subjects were from either a Screening population or a biopsy population and were imaged first on a conventional 2D full filed digital mammography system then on a 3D tomosynthesis system.

The resulting images from the this portion of the study were then randomized into a reader study.

The purpose of this clinical study was to compare the 3-D tomosynthesis system used in conjunction with a conventional 2-D digital imaging system (2-D plus 3-D images) to the conventional 2-D digital imaging system (2-D images), and to determine whether the 2-D plus 3-D images compared to the 2-D images alone would:

1. Reduce the recall rate And/or
2. Improve ROC area due to improved breast cancer detection and/or improved lesion classification.
Breast Cancer
DEVICE: Tomosynthesis digital mammography imaging system
To detect a 20% reduction in the recall rate when comparing the recall rate using the BIRADS 0 scores of the 2-D plus 3-D images to the 2-D images., 10-12 months
To detect a 0.05 increase in the area under the ROC curve when comparing 2-D plus 3-D images to the 2-D images., 10-12 months
