Non Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs in the Prevention of Bone Pain Flares After Palliative Radiotherapy
Solid tumors have the tendency to spread to other organs in around 26% of cases, with many cases involving the bone causing severe bone destruction and pain that reduces patients' quality of life. Palliative radiation therapy is used as a standard of care to decrease cancer-related bone pain, as it has been proven to provide pain relief in many patients, either partially or totally, within only a few weeks. However, some patients experience worsening of bone pain especially within the first 10 days after radiation therapy, this is called bone pain flare, and its incidence is estimated to be around 40%. This pain flare tends to further reduce these patients' quality of life considering their main illness, which necessitates its prevention or alleviation.

Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) which are a key component of the World Health Organization (WHO) analgesic options used to alleviate cancer pain have not had a good share of published trials in the prevention of bone pain flares.

In this light the investigators aim to conduct a double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomized controlled trial to investigate the effectiveness of NSAIDs, specifically Proxen, in preventing bone pain flares after palliative radiotherapy, and as a secondary endpoint they will compare the quality of life and side effects experienced by patients in either group.

DRUG: Naproxen (Proxen S)|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Esomeprazole 20mg once daily
Occurrence of a pain flare within the first 10 days after palliative radiation therapy, Subjects will be monitored for the occurrence of a pain flare during the first 10 days after the start of their palliative radiotherapy through daily phone calls by the research fellow who will ask the necessary questions to fill out the Brief Pain Inventory questionnaire and compare baseline pain scores to follow-up pain scores. This questionnaire has a minimum score of 0 and maximum score of 110, with higher scores indicating more pain. A pain flare will be considered positive if there is:

* Two-point increase from baseline on a pain scale from 0-10 with no increase in analgesic medication intake OR
* At least 25% increase in the intake of analgesic (daily oral morphine) with no decrease in pain scores on a pain scale, From enrollment till 10 days after the start of palliative radiotherapy
Change in quality of life from start of palliative radiotherapy till one month after, Quality of life scores will be assessed through daily phone calls to the subjects performed by the research fellow who will ask the subjects the necessary questions to fill out the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-BM22) and compare the baseline scores to the recent ones. This questionnaire has a minimum score of 22 and a maximum score of 88, with higher scores indicating greater distress and hence lower quality of life. The phone calls will be daily the first 10 days after start of palliative radiotherapy, and then weekly for a total of 30 days after the start of palliative radiotherapy., From enrollment till 30 days after the start of palliative radiotherapy
