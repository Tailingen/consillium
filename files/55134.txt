Safety and Efficiency of γδ T Cell Against Liver Cancer
In this study, effects of γδT cells on human Liver Cancer in combination with tumor reducing surgery, for example, cryosurgery going to be investigated.
Liver Cancer
PROCEDURE: Cryosurgery or IRE surgery|BIOLOGICAL: γδ T cell|OTHER: γδ T cells/ A Cryosurgery or IRE
Relief degree of tumors, It will be evaluated by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors（RECIST）, 3 months|Progress free survival（PFS）, 1 year|Overall survival（OS）, 3 years
A liver tumor will be removed using tumor reducing surgery such as cryosurgery.PBMC of the patient will be separated from peripheral blood. After making them potential cancer killer γδ T Cell and DC-CIK, they will be infused to the patients as an immunotherapy treatment.

NOTE: Originally, our designed proposal was to use autologous PBMCs from cancer patients to ex vivo expand Vγ9Vδ2-T cells, and then perform adoptive transfer therapy. However, PBMCs of majority of cancer patients could not be effectively expanded, including cell number, cell purity and cell function could not meet the requirements of reinfusion. Meanwhile, those patients could not tolerate 100ml of blood drawing for culture every 2 \~ 3 weeks.

Therefore, we submitted new clinical study application to the ethical committee of the Fuda Hospital affiliated with Jinan University (Guangzhou, PR. China) by changing the autologous protocol with the allogeneic protocol. After the allogeneic protocol was approved, we adapted allogeneic cells instead of autologous in our subsequentially clinical study.
