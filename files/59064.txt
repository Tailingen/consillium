Development of a Cinical and Biological Database in Ovarian, Fallopian Tube and Peritoneal Cancers
A Clinical and Biological Database will provide to the scientific community a collection of blood and tissues with clinical datas to improve knowledge about cancer and help to develope new cancer treatments. This database is specific to epithetial ovarian cancer, Fallopian tube cancer and Primitive peritoneal cancer.
Carcinoma, Ovarian Epithelial|Fallopian Tube Neoplasms|Peritoneal Neoplasms
OTHER: Biological collection
Proportion of patients who gave their consent to participate in the study, The proportion of patients who consent to participate in the study among the screened patients, Until the study completion : 3 years
A Clinical and Biological Database is a collection of reliable, prospective and representative datas.

This collection, provided to the scientific community, will help to develope research programs such as :

* Cinicals and biological predictive factors of treatments response
* Identification of biological tumoral markers associate with survival
* Identification of prognosic factors after recidivism
* Diagnostics tests optimisation and follow-up from blood samples ( Circulating Tumor Cells (CTC) )
* Developing strong preclinical models. Those models would be later used to test alternative treatments and would help to identify new biomarkers
