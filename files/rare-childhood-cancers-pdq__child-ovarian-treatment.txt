Clinical Presentation, Histology, and Prognosis
Treatment of Childhood Epithelial Ovarian Neoplasia
Clinical Presentation, Histology, and Prognosis
The most common presenting symptoms of ovarian tumors in children are dysmenorrhea and abdominal pain.
Ovarian  tumors derived
from malignant epithelial elements include the following types:
Serous cystomas.
Mucinous cystomas.
Endometrial tumors.
Clear cell tumors.
There are subtypes within each tumor type. The subtypes include benign tumors, tumors with low malignant potential or borderline tumors, and adenocarcinomas. Most ovarian tumors in pediatric patients are benign and borderline,[
1
] with rare malignant lesions in adolescent patients.[
2
] Studies have reported the following:
In the Italian prospective multicenter study of rare tumors (TREP project), 16 patients were identified during a 14-year period. Eight patients had benign tumors (seven mucinous cystadenoma and one serous cystadenoma), and eight patients had borderline tumors (two serous and six mucinous).[
3
][
Level of evidence C1
] No malignant tumors were identified. High levels of cancer antigen  125 were detected in 6 of 15 patients.
In another series of 19 patients younger than 21 years  with epithelial ovarian neoplasms, the average age at diagnosis was 19.7 years.  Dysmenorrhea and abdominal pain were the most common presenting symptoms. Low malignant potential or well-differentiated tumors were diagnosed in 84% of patients. Seventy-nine percent of the patients had stage I disease, with a 100% survival rate. Only patients who had small cell anaplastic carcinomas died.[
4
][
Level of evidence C1
]
A series of female patients younger than 19 years with borderline or malignant epithelial ovarian tumors in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program database reported the following:[
5
]
There were 114 cases of borderline ovarian tumors identified. Of these, 53.5% were serous histology and 44.8% were mucinous histology. The 10-year overall survival (OS) rate was 97.3% for these patients.
There were 140 cases of malignant epithelial ovarian tumors identified. The median age of these patients was 17 years. Mucinous (56.4%) and serous (20.7%) adenocarcinoma were the most common histologies. Most patients had stage I disease (70.2%). Fertility-sparing surgery was commonly performed (rate of uterine preservation for stage I disease, 91.7%). The 5-year OS rate was 93.6% for patients with stage I disease, compared with 48.3% for those with extra-ovarian spread.
Girls with ovarian carcinoma (epithelial ovarian neoplasia) fare better than do adults with similar histology, probably because girls usually present with low-stage disease.[
4
,
5
]
The potential association with genetic predisposition (e.g.,
BRCA
variant) in pediatric patients has not yet been studied.
Treatment of Childhood Epithelial Ovarian Neoplasia
Treatment options for nonmalignant childhood epithelial ovarian neoplasia include the following:
Surgery alone.
Treatment of epithelial ovarian neoplasia is based on stage and histology. Most pediatric and adolescent patients have stage I disease. In the TREP study,[
3
] of the eight patients with benign tumors, seven patients had stage I disease, and one patient had stage III disease. Of the eight patients with borderline tumors, three patients had stage I disease, and five patients had stage III disease (based on washings and omental implants). All 16 patients were treated with surgery alone. At the time of the report, 15 patients were alive without disease; the one death was not from ovarian cancer.
Treatment options for childhood malignant ovarian epithelial cancer include the following:
Surgery.
Chemotherapy.
Treatment of malignant ovarian epithelial cancer is stage-related and follows adult protocols, which may include
surgery and chemotherapy. For more information, see
Ovarian Epithelial, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Cancer Treatment

General Information About Sex Cord–Stromal Tumors
Clinical presentation
The clinical presentation and prognosis of patients with sex cord–stromal tumors vary by histology. In all entities, metastatic spread occurs rarely and, if present, is usually limited to the peritoneal cavity.[
1
] Distant metastases mostly occur in patients whose disease has relapsed. Some tumors may be associated with hormone secretion—for example, estrogen in granulosa cell tumors or androgens in Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors.[
2
]
Diagnostic evaluation
In the United States, these tumors may be registered in the
International Testicular and Ovarian Stromal Tumor Registry
.[
3
] In Europe, patients are prospectively registered in the national rare tumor groups.[
3
,
4
] The recommendations regarding diagnostic work-up, staging, and therapeutic strategy have been harmonized between these registries.[
3
]
The
European Cooperative Study Group for Pediatric Rare Tumors
within the
PARTNER project (Paediatric Rare Tumours Network - European Registry)
has published comprehensive recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of sex cord–stromal tumors in children and adolescents.[
5
]
Histology and molecular features
Ovarian sex cord–stromal tumors are a heterogeneous group of rare tumors that derive from the gonadal non–germ cell component.[
1
]  Histological subtypes display some areas of gonadal differentiation and include juvenile (and, rarely, adult) granulosa cell tumors, Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors, and sclerosing stromal tumors. Other histological subtypes, such as steroid cell tumor, sex cord tumor with annular tubules, or thecoma, are exceedingly rare.
Ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors in children and adolescents are commonly associated with the presence of germline
DICER1
pathogenic variants and may be a manifestation of familial pleuropulmonary blastoma syndrome.[
6
] A two-institution study analyzed eight children aged 4 to 16 years who were diagnosed with Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors. All eight tumors were found to harbor somatic hotspot
DICER1
variants, and five patients carried germline
DICER1
pathogenic variants (two of them had the phenotype of
DICER1
syndrome).[
7
] Individuals with Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor were enrolled in the International Pleuropulmonary Blastoma/
DICER1
Registry and/or the International Ovarian and Testicular Stromal Tumor Registry.[
8
] In total, 191 participants with ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor were enrolled, with most presenting with Fédération Internationale de Gynécologie et d’Obstétrique (FIGO) stage I disease (92%, 175 of 191 patients). Germline
DICER1
variant testing results were available for 156 patients; 58% of these patients had a pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline variant. Somatic
DICER1
variant testing showed RNase IIIB hotspot variants in 97% (88 of 91) of intermediate- and poorly differentiated tumors.
Prognostic factors
Prognostic factors related to stage and high mitotic count have been identified. In a report from the German Maligne Keimzelltumoren (MAKEI) study, 54 children and adolescents with prospectively registered sex cord–stromal tumors were analyzed. Forty-eight patients presented with stage I tumors, and six patients had peritoneal metastases. While overall prognosis was favorable, patients at risk could be identified by stage (stage IC, preoperative rupture, stages II and III) and histological criteria such as high mitotic count.[
9
]
A study of 44 patients from the European Cooperative Study Group on Pediatric Rare Tumors showed that stage and histopathologic differentiation determined the prognosis of patients with Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors.[
10
]
Individuals with Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor were enrolled in the International Pleuropulmonary Blastoma/
DICER1
Registry and/or the International Ovarian and Testicular Stromal Tumor Registry.[
8
] In total, 191 participants with ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor were enrolled. Adjuvant chemotherapy was administered to 40% of patients (77 of 191). Among these patients, nearly all received platinum-based regimens (95%, 73 of 77), and 30% (23 of 77) received regimens that included an alkylating agent. The 3-year recurrence-free survival rate was 93.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 88.2%–99.3%) for patients with stage IA tumors, compared with 67.1% (95% CI, 55.2%–81.6%) for patients with stage IC tumors and 60.6% (95% CI, 40.3%–91.0%) for patients with stage II to stage IV tumors (
P
< .001). Among patients with FIGO stage I tumors, those with mesenchymal heterologous elements who were treated with surgery alone were at higher risk of recurrence (hazard ratio [HR], 74.18; 95% CI, 17.99–305.85).
Treatment of childhood sex cord–stromal tumors
Treatment options for childhood sex cord–stromal tumors include the following:
Surgery.
Chemotherapy.
A French registry identified 38 girls younger than 18 years with ovarian sex cord–stromal tumors.[
2
]
Complete surgical resection was achieved in 23 of 38 girls who did not receive adjuvant treatment.
Two patients who had a complete surgical resection had recurrent disease. One patient's tumor responded to  chemotherapy, and the other patient died.
Fifteen  girls had tumor rupture and/or ascites.  Eleven of the 15 patients received chemotherapy and did not have a disease recurrence. Of the four patients who did not receive chemotherapy, all had a recurrence and two died.
Childhood Juvenile Granulosa Cell Tumors
The most common histological subtype of sex cord–stromal tumors in girls younger than 18 years is juvenile granulosa cell tumor  (median age,
7.6 years; range, birth to 17.5 years).[
11
,
12
] Juvenile granulosa cell tumors represent about
5% of ovarian tumors in children and adolescents and are distinct from the
granulosa cell tumors seen in adults.[
1
,
13
]
Risk factors
Juvenile granulosa cell tumors have been reported in children with
Ollier disease and Maffucci syndrome.[
14
-
16
]
Clinical presentation
Patients
with juvenile granulosa cell tumors present with the following symptoms:[
17
,
18
]
Precocious puberty (most common; caused by estrogen secretion).
Abdominal pain.
Abdominal mass.
Ascites.
Treatment of childhood juvenile granulosa cell tumors
Treatment options for childhood juvenile granulosa cell tumors include the following:
Surgery
.
Chemotherapy
.
Surgery
As many as 90% of children with juvenile granulosa cell tumors will have
low-stage disease (stage I) by FIGO
criteria. These patients are usually curable with unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy alone. In one series, 15 of 17 patients underwent fertility-sparing surgery, and only two patients received adjuvant chemotherapy. No recurrences were reported.[
19
]
Chemotherapy
Patients with spontaneous tumor rupture or malignant ascites (FIGO stage IC2, IC3), advanced disease (FIGO stages II–IV), or tumors with high mitotic
activity have a poorer prognosis and require chemotherapy.[
2
,
4
,
13
] Cisplatin-based chemotherapy
regimens have been used with some success in both the adjuvant and recurrent disease settings.[

Childhood Sertoli-Leydig Cell Tumors
Clinical presentation and risk factors
Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor is a common histological subtype of sex cord–stromal tumors. It is rare in young girls and more frequently seen in adolescents. The tumor may secrete androgens and, thus, present with virilization, secondary amenorrhea,[
23
] or precocious puberty.[
24
]
These tumors may be associated with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, but more frequently are a part of the DICER1-tumor spectrum.[
6
,
25
,
26
] Patients with Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors should be evaluated for germline
DICER1
pathogenic variants. If a germline
DICER1
pathogenic variant is found, regular follow-up for ovarian and other tumors such as thyroid disease (multinodular goiter, carcinoma) should be considered. Genetic counseling should also be considered.[
26
,
27
]
Treatment and outcome of childhood Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors
Treatment options for childhood Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors include the following:
Surgery
.
Chemotherapy
.
Surgery
Surgery is the primary treatment for Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors and is the only treatment for low-stage disease (FIGO stage IA). The event-free survival rate for these patients is approximately 100%.[
2
][
Level of evidence C1
] However, up to 10% of patients may develop metachronous contralateral tumors, particularly in the context of underlying
DICER1
germline pathogenic variants.[
28
]
Chemotherapy
Patients with Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors with abdominal spillage during surgery, spontaneous tumor rupture, or metastatic disease (FIGO stages IC, II, III, and IV) are treated with cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy, although the impact of chemotherapy has not been studied in clinical trials in children.[
2
,
10
]
One study reported on 40 women (average age, 28 years) with FIGO stage I or IC Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors of the ovary.[
29
][
Level of evidence C1
]
Of 34 patients with intermediate or poor differentiation, 23 patients received postoperative chemotherapy (most regimens included cisplatin). None of these patients experienced disease recurrence.
Of the 11 patients who did not receive postoperative chemotherapy, two had disease recurrence. Both of these patients had tumors that were salvaged with chemotherapy.

Treatment Options Under Clinical Evaluation for Childhood Ovarian Cancer
Information about National Cancer Institute (NCI)–supported clinical trials can be found on the
NCI website
. For information about clinical trials sponsored by other organizations, see the
ClinicalTrials.gov website
.
The following is an example of a national and/or institutional clinical trial that is currently being conducted:
PEPN2121 (NCT05286801)
(Tiragolumab and Atezolizumab for the Treatment of Relapsed or Refractory
SMARCB1
- or
SMARCA4
-Deficient Tumors)
:
This trial is evaluating the combination of a PD-L1 targeting antibody (atezolizumab) with a TIGIT targeting antibody (tiragolumab) for patients with
SMARCB1
- or
SMARCA4
-deficient tumors. Patients with small cell carcinomas of the ovary, hypercalcemia type, may be eligible for this study.
Special Considerations for the Treatment of Children With Cancer
Cancer in children and adolescents is rare, although the overall incidence has slowly increased since 1975.[
1
]    Children and adolescents with cancer should be referred to medical centers that have a multidisciplinary team of cancer specialists with experience treating the cancers that occur during childhood and adolescence.  This multidisciplinary team approach incorporates the skills
of the following pediatric specialists and others to ensure that children receive treatment, supportive care, and rehabilitation
to achieve optimal survival and quality of life:
Primary care physicians.
Pediatric surgeons.
Pathologists.
Pediatric radiation
oncologists.
Pediatric medical oncologists and hematologists.
Ophthalmologists.
Rehabilitation
specialists.
Pediatric oncology nurses.
Social workers.
Child-life professionals.
Psychologists.
Nutritionists.
For specific information about supportive care for children and adolescents with cancer, see the summaries on
Supportive and Palliative Care
.
The American Academy of Pediatrics has outlined guidelines for
pediatric cancer centers and their role in the treatment of children and adolescents
with cancer.[
2
]  At
these centers, clinical trials are available for most  types of cancer that occur in children and adolescents, and the opportunity
to participate is offered to most patients and their families.  Clinical
trials for children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer are generally
designed to compare potentially better therapy with current standard therapy. Other types of clinical trials test novel therapies when there is no standard therapy for a cancer diagnosis.  Most of the progress in identifying curative
therapies for childhood cancers has been achieved through clinical trials. 
Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the
NCI website
.
Dramatic improvements in survival have been achieved for children and adolescents with cancer. Between 1975 and 2020, childhood cancer mortality decreased by more than 50%.[

-
5
]  Childhood and adolescent cancer survivors require close monitoring because side effects of cancer therapy may persist or develop months or years after treatment.  For information about the incidence, type, and monitoring of late effects in childhood and adolescent cancer survivors, see
Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer
.
Childhood cancer is a rare disease, with about 15,000 cases diagnosed annually in the United States in individuals younger than 20 years.[
6
] The U.S.
Rare Diseases Act of 2002
defines a rare disease as one that affects populations smaller than 200,000 people in the United States. Therefore, all pediatric cancers are considered rare.
The designation of a rare tumor is not uniform among pediatric and adult groups. In adults, rare cancers are defined as those with an annual incidence of fewer than six cases per 100,000 people. They account for up to 24% of all cancers diagnosed in the European Union and about 20% of all cancers diagnosed in the United States.[
7
,
8
] In children and adolescents, the designation of a rare tumor is not uniform among international groups, as follows:
A consensus effort between the European Union Joint Action on Rare Cancers and the European Cooperative Study Group for Rare Pediatric Cancers estimated that 11% of all cancers in patients younger than 20 years could be categorized as very rare. This consensus group defined very rare cancers as those with annual incidences of fewer than two cases per 1 million people. However, three additional histologies (thyroid carcinoma, melanoma, and testicular cancer) with incidences of more than two cases per 1 million people were also included  in the very rare group due to a lack of knowledge and expertise in the management of these tumors.[
9
]
The Children's Oncology Group defines rare pediatric cancers as those listed in the International Classification of Childhood Cancer subgroup XI, which includes thyroid cancers, melanomas and nonmelanoma skin cancers, and multiple types of carcinomas (e.g., adrenocortical carcinomas, nasopharyngeal carcinomas, and most adult-type carcinomas such as breast cancers and colorectal cancers).[
10
]  These diagnoses account for about 5% of the cancers diagnosed in children aged 0 to 14 years and about 27% of the cancers diagnosed in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years.[
4
]
Most cancers in subgroup XI are either melanomas or thyroid cancers, with other cancer types accounting for only 2% of the cancers diagnosed in children aged 0 to 14 years and 9.3% of the cancers diagnosed in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years.
These rare cancers are extremely challenging to study because of the relatively few patients with any individual diagnosis, the predominance of rare cancers in the adolescent population, and the small number of clinical trials for adolescents with rare cancers.
Information about these tumors may also be found in sources relevant to
adults with cancer, such as
Ovarian Epithelial, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Cancer Treatment
