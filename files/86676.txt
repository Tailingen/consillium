Real World Efficiency of Trastuzumab in Early Breast Cancer
AIM To determine the value of trastuzumab in the early breast cancer setting in the Netherlands.

RESEARCH QUESTIONS / OBJECTIVES

1. Is adjuvant trastuzumab in daily practice effectively used, that is, how and to whom is it given?
2. Is the introduction of trastuzumab in early breast cancer cost-effective for the Netherlands?

To address the research questions (objectives), the following outcome measures will be determined:

CLINICAL OUTCOME MEASURES

1. Actual trastuzumab administration as opposed to planned trastuzumab administration
2. Selection criteria for chemotherapy and trastuzumab in daily practice
3. Immediate and longterm toxicities due to adjuvant treatment, specifically cardiac
4. Disease-free, breast cancer specific, and overall survival in relation to trastuzumab

   ECONOMIC OUTCOME MEASURES
5. Volumes and costs of diagnostic tests and therapies including those for (distant) relapse
6. Cost-effectiveness of trastuzumab in clinical trials versus in real world
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Trastuzumab
Effectiveness of the use of trastuzumab in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive tumor, Disease free survival, events, within an average of 5-year between diagnosis and last follow up
Number of patients treated with trastuzumab who develop (cardio)toxicity?, cardiotoxicity, temporary or definite stop trastuzumab, within an average of 5-year between diagnosis and last follow up
Cost-effectiveness os trastuzumab in adjuvant breast cancer patients, volume and cost, within an average of 5-year between diagnosis and last follow up
