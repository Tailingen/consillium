A Clinico-Pathological Study to Investigate the Possible Infective Causes of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma of the Ocular Adnexae
Patients with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma of the ocular adnexae (MLOA) will be eligible for treatment with doxycycline (part A: clinico-pathological study); patients with other types of ocular lymphoma, inflammatory lesions or those ineligible/unwilling for treatment with doxycycline can participate in the only pathologic study (part B).
Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
DRUG: doxycycline (tetracycline)
response rates, at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 12 months and 24 months from start of doxycycline
Patients with suspected lymphoma of the ocular adnexae will undergo a diagnostic biopsy in the usual way. If lymphoma is confirmed the patient will undergo a full staging evaluation and entry into either part A or B of the study will then be considered as follows:

* clinico-pathological (part A) for patients with MALT lymphoma of the ocular adnexae (MLOA) and eligible for treatment with Doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 3 weeks ; or
* pathology only (part B) for patients with other types of ocular lymphoma, inflammatory lesions or those ineligible/unwilling for treatment with doxycycline.
