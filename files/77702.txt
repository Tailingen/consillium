Hypofractionated Radiotherapy Post-Lumpectomy in Women With Node Negative Breast Cancer
To determine if hypofractionated radiotherapy to the whole breast (4,250 cGy/16 fractions over 22 days) is equally effective to standard fractionated radiotherapy (5,000 cGy/25 fractions over 35 days) in women with node negative breast cancer who have undergone lumpectomy.

The primary outcome is local breast recurrence and secondary outcomes include morbidity and cost effectiveness.
