This is a cross-sectional, observational study of high-risk HPV status, cervical cytology and HPV vaccine uptake and response in young women with perinatally acquired HIV.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Human papillomavirus testing|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Cervical cytology|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: HPV serology
Prevalence of Abnormal Cervical Cytology, Cervical sample taken in the clinic setting and sent to the laboratory for cytological examination. Prevalence of abnormal cytology is reported as the number of samples that had a non-normal cytology result (e.g. dyskaryotic cells) out of the total number tested, 1 year
Prevalence of High Risk HPV by Subtype, Cervical sample taken in the clinic setting and tested for high-risk HPV on site using the Cepheid GeneXpert. Prevalence reported as the number of samples that were positive for any high-risk HPV out of all those tested, 1 year|Prevalence of CIN2+, Participants with abnormal cytology and/or tested positive for high-risk HPV were referred for colposcopy. Prevalence reported as the number of participants who were diagnosed with CIN2+, 1 year|HPV Serology (16/18), Number of participants testing positive for HPV 16 and 18 antibodies out of the those tested, 1 year
This is an observational study of cervical cytology assessment, high risk human papilloma virus (hr-HPV) status, and HPV antibody titres amongst adult women living with perinatally acquired HIV infection (PaHIV). Eligible consenting participants will have two samples taken; firstly, a cervical sample tested for cytology and Hr-HPV with the Cepheid GeneXpert HPV; secondly serum will be assessed for hr-HPV serology. All women with PaHIV, vaccinated and unvaccinated for HPV, over the age of 18 years will be eligible and will be recruited into one of two cohorts: (1) sexually active women: full study, cervical and blood sampling or (2) non-sexually active women, blood sampling only (total n=80). Follow up for abnormal smear results or hr-HPV positivity will be arranged through colposcopy.
