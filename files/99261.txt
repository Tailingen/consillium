Ezurpimtrostat Autophagy Inhibitor in Association With Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab in First Line Treatment of Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The study will assess the efficacy of Ezurpimtrostat in association with standard of care (Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab), compared to standard of care alone, as first line treatment in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.The study drug which is tested is the Ezurpimtrostat in association with Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab to allow a better tumor response as well as better survival outcomes with an acceptable safety.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: Ezurpimtrostat|DRUG: Atezolizumab|DRUG: Bevacizumab
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Progression-Free Survival (PFS), defined as the time from randomization to the occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first.

Progression events will be considered based on centralized tumor response assessment according to RECIST version 1.1 and PFS analyses will be performed by the CHU Grenoble Alpes Statistics department., At 36 months
Objective response rate (ORR), Best overall objective response rate (ORR) and ORR at 3,6,9,12 months according to RECIST 1.1 and IRF-assessed tumor response according to HCC mRECIST, At 3,6,9,12 months
The study is a multicentric, prospective, comparative, randomized, open-label phase 2b trial. This study will enroll 187 to 196 patients and consists of 2 parts: Safety Lead-in Phase and Expansion Phase. Initially, 3 to 12 patients will be enrolled into a Safety Lead-in Phase based on a 3 + 3 design, with the possibility of dose de-escalation, to confirm the recommended dose of Ezurpimtrostat.The randomized Expansion Phase will start after completion of Safety Lead-in Phase at the confirmed dose and will include 184 patients. Patients will be randomly assigned between experimental arm (Ezurpimtrostat + Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab) and control arm (Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab) according to a 1:1 repartition.
