Study of RP-6306 Alone or in Combination with RP-3500 or Debio 0123 in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors
The primary purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of RP-6306 alone and in combination with RP-3500 or in combination with Debio 0123 in patients with eligible advanced solid tumors, determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and assess preliminary anti-tumor activity.
