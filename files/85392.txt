MEKTOVIÂ® for the Treatment of Pediatric Adamantinomatous Craniopharyngioma
MEKTOVI (binimetinib) is an oral, highly selective reversible inhibitor of mitogen-activated extracellular signal regulated kinase 1 (MEK1) and MEK2. The biological activity of binimetinib that has been evaluated bith in vitro and in vivo in a wide variety of tumor types In this Phase II, the drug will be used to treat pediatric patients diagnosed with recurrent Adamantinomatous Craniopharyngioma including patients who have undergone surgery and/or radiation therapy.

Sustained objective response rate of patients with recurrent/progressive previously irradiated ACP to treatment with oral binimetinib, To calculate the number of patients who experience sustained objective response rate \[minor response (MR) + partial response (PR) + complete response (CR)\] of patients with recurrent/progressive previously irradiated Adamantinomatous Craniopharyngioma to treatment with oral binimetinib (Stratum 1)., From Day 1 of treatment through 30 days following end of protocol treatment|Sustained objective response rate of patients with measurable ACP who have undergone surgery but have not been previously treated with radiation to treatment with oral binimetinib, To calculate the number of patients who experience sustained objective response rate (MR + PR + CR) of patients with measurable Adamantinomatous Craniopharyngioma who have undergone surgery but have not been previously treated with radiation to treatment with oral binimetinib (Stratum 2)., From Day 1 of treatment through 30 days following end of protocol treatment
Biological effects of binimetinib on ACP tumor tissue and cyst fluid., To measure concentrations of various chemokines including IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and CXCL1in cyst fluid or tumor or blood of ACP patients treated with binimetinib. Comparisons will be made with known levels in the literature and among patient samples from within the study., From Day 1 of treatment through 30 days following end of protocol treatment|Toxicities associated with tocilizumab in children with ACP, To calculate the number of participants with, as well as frequency and severity of, binimetinib-related Adverse Events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0 in children with recurrent or refractory ACP, 24 months|PFS of ACP patients treated with binimetinib after radiation, To assess one-year progression-free survival (PFS) rates for patients with ACP who are treated with binimetinib following progression after radiation (Stratum 1)., 12 months|PFS of ACP patients treated with binimetinib who have not received radiation, To assess one-year progression-free survival (PFS) rates for patients with ACP who are treated with binimetinib who have not previously received radiation (Stratum 2)., 12 months
Adamantinomatous Craniopharyngioma (ACP) is a highly debilitating pediatric brain tumor that lacks medical anti-tumor therapies. Current therapy, which depends largely on surgery and radiation, is associated with poor quality of life and becomes more challenging and risky in the setting of recurrent disease. Recent discoveries regarding the biological characteristics of ACP indicate that available agents, including Mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathway inhibitors may have efficacy in the control of ACP. Binimetinib is one such agent.

In this study, up to 38 patients will receive oral binimetinib at the recommended phase 2 pediatric dose (RP2D) of 32 mg/m2/dose PO every 12 hours for 4 weeks which represents one cycle. Cycles will last 28 days and treatment may continue for up to two years (26 cycles).

It will be a multi-center Phase 2 trial with two strata for patients aged \>1 year and \<25 years with measurable ACP who may have been previously treated with radiation (Stratum 1, 18 patients) or without radiation (Stratum 2, 18 patients).
