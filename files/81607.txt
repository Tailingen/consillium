A Phase I Study of NTQ1062 in Chinese Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is an open-label, single-arm, phase 1 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary pharmacodynamic effect of NTQ1062 in patients with advanced solid tumors.

The study comprises a dose-escalation phase and a dose-expansion phase.

1. Dose-escalation:using 3+3 design to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profile of NTQ1062 at 20, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400 mg in patients with advanced solid tumors, and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).
2. Dose-expansion:the dose-expansion study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary pharmacodynamic effect of the MTD for NTQ1062 in patients with advanced solid tumors, and to identify the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: NTQ1062
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), The MTD is defined as the highest dose reached for which the incidence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) occurs in less than 1/3 of the subjects., First treatment cycle (i.e., the first 28 days post the first dose)|Recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), The RP2D of NTQ1062 will be determined during the dose-escalation phase of the study. RP2D will be determined using available safety and pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics data., First treatment cycle (i.e., the first 28 days post the first dose)|Adverse events, Safety and tolerability of NTQ1062. Incidence of adverse events., through study completion, an average of 1 year
Pharmacokinetic parameters:Cmax, Maximum Serum Concentration (Cmax) of NTQ1062., At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Pharmacokinetic parameters: Tmax, Time to Maximum Serum Concentration (Tmax) of NTQ1062., At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Pharmacokinetic parameters: AUC, The area under the concentration versus time curve of NTQ1062., At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Pharmacokinetic parameters:T1/2, The terminal half-life of NTQ1062., At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as participants with confirmed complete or partial response (CR+PR) per RECIST, v1.1, through study completion, an average of 1 year|Disease Control Rate(DCR), DCR was defined as the proportion of patients who had an overall response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD)., through study completion, an average of 1 year|Duration of Response(DOR), DOR is defined as the time between date of first response and the first occurrence. of progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., through study completion, an average of 1 year|Progression-free Survival(PFS), PFS will be defined as the time between the first dose of any study drug and the first occurrence of progression or death from any cause., through study completion, an average of 1 year
