Study of HR20013 for Injection in Patients With Malignant Solid Tumors
To evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of single-dose HR20013 for injection combined with dexamethasone in patients with malignant solid tumors receiving cisplatin-based chemotherapy.
Prevention of Nausea and Vomiting Caused by Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy
DRUG: HR20013 for injection；dexamethason
AUC0-t ：area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to the time of the last quantifiable concentration, 0 to 504 hours|AUC0-∞：Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve From Time 0 to Infinity, 0 to 504 hours|Cmax：observed maximum plasma concentration, 0 to 504 hours|Tmax：observed time to reach Cmax, 0 to 504 hours|T1/2z：apparent terminal half-life, 0 to 504 hours
