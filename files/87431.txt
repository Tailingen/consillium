Gene Expression Profiling in a Validation Cohort of Locally Advanced and Recurrent/Metastatic Salivary Gland Cancers
The INDAGA-UK trial is a retrospective, multi-centre observational study in participants with locally advanced and recurrent salivary gland to investigate t its molecular profiling, and to explore new prognostic and druggable markers. We will analyse samples and data from patients diagnosed with salivary gland cancer from 2013 - 2023. Subject and sample identification will occur over a 12-month period. Samples and data will be analysed over the next 12 months prior to study end.
