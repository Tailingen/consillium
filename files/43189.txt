Feasibility of Combined Genomics/Transcriptomics for Patients With Lymphoma
To learn more about the usefulness of molecular testing with the Molecular Functional (MF) Portrait (a commercial test conducted by the sponsor of this study, BostonGene) in guiding lymphoma care.
Lymphoma
OTHER: Molecular Functional Portrait
Percentage of participants who have genomic test results available in <=7 days, through study completion an average of 1 year
Primary Objective:

â€¢ To determine the feasibility and turnaround of clinical WES and transcriptome sequencing

Secondary Objectives:

* To determine the frequency of actionable DNA and RNA alterations
* To determine the concordance of DNA and RNA alterations
* To determine the frequency of molecularly matched therapy
* To determine the feasibility of identifying mechanism(s) of acquired resistance with genomic profiling
* To determine the feasibility of molecularly matched therapy to acquired resistance alterations

Exploratory Objectives:

* To determine the feasibility of prioritizing targets with precision analytics
* To determine clinical outcomes in patients receiving molecularly matched therapy
* To determine the role of additional emerging diagnostic technologies
