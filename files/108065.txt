Study of How Safe and Effective Tarlatamab is in Brain Cancers
This is a phase 2 study to assess how useful study drug tarlatamab is for the treatment of patients with recurrent/refractory oligodendroglioma or astrocytoma with a mutation in the IDH gene.
Astrocytic Tumor|Oligodendroglial Tumor
DRUG: Tarlatamab
Percent change in CD8+ T cell infiltrate, 3 years
Percent change in CD3/CD45RA/RO T cells, 3 years|Percent change in T cell subsets, 3 years|Percentage change in M1 vs M2 macrophage populations, 3 years|Tumour concentrations of tarlatamab, 3 years|Serum concentrations of tarlatamab, 3 years
There will be 2 cohorts in the study.

* Cohort 1, patients whose disease is amendable for resection will be treated with up to 3 cycles of tarlatamab prior to surgical resection. These patients can resume tarlatamab treatment post-operatively until disease progression at the discretion of the investigator. Up to 10 patients may be enrolled to Cohort 1.
* Cohort 2, patients with progressive/refractory disease are eligible to receive tarlatamab at Q2W 10 mg dosing in 28 day cycles until documented disease progression, intolerable toxicity or consent withdrawal. The Simon's 2 stage design will be used. In stage 1, 13 patients will be enrolled. Based on an interim analysis of efficacy, stage 2 will aim to enroll an additional 21 patients for a total of 34 patients.
