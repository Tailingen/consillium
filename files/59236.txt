Study of JTX-8064, as Monotherapy and in Combination With a PD-1 Inhibitor, in Adult Subjects With Advanced Refractory Solid Tumors
JTX-8064-101 is a Phase 1/2, open label, dose escalation and dose expansion clinical study to determine the safety, tolerability, and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of JTX-8064 alone and in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor (PD-1i).

JTX-8064 is a humanized mAb designed to block the interaction of LILRB2 with its known ligands, endogenous major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) molecules. This is a Phase 1/2, first in human, open label, multicenter, dose escalation and dose expansion clinical trial to determine the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and RP2D of JTX-8064 when administered as a single agent and in combination with a PD-1i in adult subjects with advanced refractory solid tumor malignancies. Additionally, the study will seek to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of JTX-8064, and preliminary efficacy of JTX-8064 as a monotherapy and in combination with a PD-1i.
