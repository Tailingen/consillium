A Phase II Study of Envofolimab and BD0801 With/Without Chemotherapy in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is an open label, multi-cohort, multicenter Phase II study, the purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of envofolimab in combination with BD0801 injection with/without chemotherapy for the treatment of advanced solid tumors
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: Envofolimab|DRUG: BD0801|DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Irinotecan|DRUG: Leucovorin calcium|DRUG: 5-Fluorouridine
Part I: MTD（Maximum tolerable dose）or RD（Recommended dose）, MTD: A maximum dose of acceptable safety, at least 6 patients treated with this dose, and less than 1/3 of patients experienced DLT(Dose limited toxicity).

RD:The following will be taken into account to make decision about RD: MTD, if is reached; PK characteristics, efficacy and safety results., 6 months|Part II: ORR(Objective Response Rate ) by investigator, Proportion of subjects who have a complete or partial response relative to baseline as assessed by investigator according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, 1.5 years
DOR(Duration Of Response) by investigator, Measured from the date of partial or complete response to therapy until the disease progression based on RECIST v1.1criteria., 1.5 years|PFS(Progression Free Survival) by investigator, PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the first documented disease progression or death, whichever occurred first. Progression was based on tumor assessment made by the investigator according to the RECIST1.1 criteria, 1.5 years|DCR(Disease Control Rate) by investigator, Proportion of subjects who have a complete or partial response, or stable disease relative to baseline as assessed by investigator according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, 1.5 years|OS（Overall Survival), OS is the time interval from the date of randomization to death from any cause., 2.5 years|The incidence of AEs（adverse events) and SAEs（serious adverse events), Frequency and severity of Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events as defined by CTCAE version 5.0, 2 years|ORR in subgroup of different TMB、PDL-1 and MSI status, Proportion of subjects who have a complete or partial response relative to baseline as assessed by investigator according to RECIST 1.1 criteria in subgroup of different TMB、PDL-1 and MSI status, 1.5 years
PK(pharmacokinetics) of envofolimab and BD0801, Plasma concentrations of envofolimab an BD0801 will be measured., 1.5 years|Positive rate of ADA(anti-drug antibody), 1.5 years|Duration of immunogenicity positive reaction, 1.5 years
The efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors combined with antivascular agents has been preliminarily demonstrated in a variety of solid tumors. Based on the huge clinical needs, the efficacy of envofolimab combined with BD0801 in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer and advanced colorectal cancer deserves further exploration.
