Feasibility of an Acute Physical Exercise Before Treatment Infusion for Metastatic Lung Cancer Patients
Because of metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (mNSCLC) and its treatments, patients suffer from numerous symptoms such as dyspnea, muscle atrophy, pain, fatigue, loss of appetite, altered physical condition and lung function, which may further impair the patient's overall condition. Nevertheless, it has been suggested that physical exercise could improve response to treatment at the clinical level due to its known effects on the immune system. Moreover, preclinical studies have shown that exercise performed during chemotherapy administration could result in physiological benefits such as improved intra-tumoral infusion and drug delivery. The ERICA study aims to assess the feasibility of an acute physical exercise immediately before immunotherapy and chemotherapy administration in patients with mNSCLC.

The GLTAPQ is a 4-item self-administered questionnaire with the first three questions designed to obtain information on the number of times an individual engages in light, moderate and intense "leisure-time PA" periods of at least 15 minutes during a typical week. The scoring of the GSLTPAQ is the "LSI" (Leisure Score Index) is obtained using the following formula: (light PA frequency × 3) + (moderate PA frequency × 5) + (vigorous PA frequency × 9). People with a moderate to high LSI ≥ 24 are classified as active, while people reporting a moderate to high LSI ≤ 23 are classified as insufficiently active (estimated energy expenditure \< 14 Kcal/kg/week)., Baseline, 3 months, 6 months|Investigate the patient anthropometrics change, Weight in kilograms, Baseline, 3 months, 6 months|Investigate the patient anthropometrics change, Hip circumference in centimeters, Baseline, 3 months, 6 months|Investigate the patient anthropometrics change, Waist circumference in centimeters, Baseline, 3 months, 6 months|Investigate the patient anthropometrics change, BMI (weight/height²), Baseline, 3 months, 6 months|Investigate the patient health-related quality of life change, Quality of life will be measured by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality Of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30).

This self-questionnaire makes it possible to evaluate the severity of the patient's sleep difficulties (initial, maintenance, morning insomnia), the degree of sleep dissatisfaction, the level of interference with daily functioning, the degree of appearance of sleep difficulties and the level of anxiety related to insomnia. The total score of the items varies between 0 and 28. A high score indicates greater sleep difficulties., Baseline, 3 months, 6 months|Investigate the impact of social vulnerability, Social vulnerability will be assessed by the EPICES score (Evaluation de la Précarité et des Inégalités de santé dans les Centres d'Examens de Santé).
