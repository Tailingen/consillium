Flotetuzumab for Relapsed Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) Following Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (Allo-HCT)
The investigators hypothesize that flotetuzumab for relapsed AML following allo-HCT will be safe, tolerable and may facilitate preferential immune effector cell retargeting of leukemic cells resulting in improved patient outcomes. Furthermore, administration of a donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) (if available) in combination with flotetuzumab will be safe, tolerable and may provide additional therapeutic efficacy.
Relapsed Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Flotetuzumab|PROCEDURE: Donor lymphocyte infusion
Efficacy as Measured by Number of Participants With CR(Mrd), CR, and CRi, * Complete remission without minimal residual disease (CRmrd): CR with negativity for a genetic marker by RT-qPCR, or CR with negativity by MFC
* Complete remission (CR): Bone marrow blasts \<5%; absence of circulating blasts and blasts with Auer rods; absence of extramedullary disease; ANC ≥1.0 × 10\^9/L (1000/µL); platelet count ≥100 × 10\^9/L (100,000/µL), transfusion independence
* CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi): All CR criteria except for residual neutropenia (\<1.0 × 10\^9/L \[1000/µL\]) or thrombocytopenia (\<100 × 10\^9/L \[100,000/µL\]), At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)
Efficacy as Measured by Number of Participants With CR and CRi, * Complete remission (CR): Bone marrow blasts \<5%; absence of circulating blasts and blasts with Auer rods; absence of extramedullary disease; ANC ≥1.0 × 10\^9/L (1000/µL); platelet count ≥100 × 10\^9/L (100,000/µL), transfusion independence
* CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi): All CR criteria except for residual neutropenia (\<1.0 × 10\^9/L \[1000/µL\]) or thrombocytopenia (\<100 × 10\^9/L \[100,000/µL\]), At the end of Cycle 2 (each cycle is 28 days)|Overall Response Rate, * Defined as partial remission or better
* PR: All hematologic criteria of CR; decrease of bone marrow blast percentage to 5 to 25%; and decrease of pretreatment bone marrow blast percentage by at least 50%, At the end of Cycle 2 (each cycle is 28 days)|Morphologic Leukemia-free State (MLFS) Rate, - MLFS: Bone marrow blasts \<5%; absence of blasts with Auer rods; absence of extramedullary disease; no hematologic recovery required, At the end of Cycle 2 (each cycle is 28 days)|Partial Remission (PR) Rate, - PR: All hematologic criteria of CR; decrease of bone marrow blast percentage to 5 to 25%; and decrease of pretreatment bone marrow blast percentage by at least 50%, At the end of Cycle 2 (each cycle is 28 days)|Stable Disease (SD) Rate, - SD: Absence of CR(mrd), CR, CRi, PR, MLFS; and criteria for PD not met, At the end of Cycle 2 (each cycle is 28 days)|Progression-free Survival (PFS) Rate, * PFS will be calculated as the time from the start of the first dose of study drug until the occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, respectively
* Progressive disease: Evidence for an increase in bone marrow blast percentage (\>50% over baseline), and/or increase of absolute blast counts in the blood (\>50% to \>25 × 10\^9/L) without differentiation syndrome, or new extramedullary disease, Through completion of follow-up, up to 2 years (median length of 80 days, full range of 11-149 days)|Overall Survival (OS), -OS will be calculated as the time from the start of the first dose of study drug until the occurrence of death from any cause., Through completion of follow-up, up to 2 years (median length of 80 days, full range of 11-149 days)|Number of Participants With Adverse Events as Measured by CTCAE v5.0, From start of treatment through 28 days following completion of treatment (median length of 59 days, full range 11-99 days).|Number of Participants With Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) Grading as Measured by ASTCT Consensus Guidelines, * Grade 1:Symptoms are not life threatening and require symptomatic treatment only, e.g., fever, nausea, fatigue, headache, myalgias, malaise
* Grade 2: Symptoms require and respond to moderate intervention; oxygen requirement \< 40% or hypotension responsive to fluids or low-dose of one vasopressor or grade 2 organ toxicity
* Grade 3: Symptoms require and respond to aggressive intervention; oxygen requirement ≥ 40% or hypotension requiring high-dose vasopressors or multiple vasopressors or grade 3 organ toxicity (except transaminitis) or grade 4 transaminitis
* Grade 4: Life-threatening symptoms; requirement for ventilator support or grade 4 organ toxicity (excluding transaminitis)
* Grade 5 Death, Through the end of Cycle 2 (each cycle is 28 days)|Number of Participants With Neurotoxicity as Measured by 2019 ASTCT Consensus Guidelines, Through the end of Cycle 2 (each cycle is 28 days)|Number of Participants With Acute Graft Versus Host Disease (GvHD) as Measured by MAGIC Criteria, Through completion of follow-up, up to 2 years (median length of 80 days, full range of 11-149 days)|Number of Participants With Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease (GvHD) as Measured by NIH Severity Score, Through completion of follow-up, up to 2 years (median length of 80 days, full range of 11-149 days)
