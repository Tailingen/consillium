DEPORRA-CoProst: Assessment of New Fluorescence Imagery Techniques Using Prostate Chips From Transurethral Resections
The aim of this study is divided in 4 different steps:

* the first step has two different purpose: assess the impact of the storage medium of fresh prostatic chips on fluorescence signal and adjust the entire chain (immunolabelling,counter-stain and imaging),
* the second step is the adaptation of immunolabelling protocol on histopathology slides, using fresh prostatic tissue,
* the third step is to validate the use of:

  1. the medical device created by the FEMTO-ST institute use for the detection of fluorescence signal on fresh tissue,
  2. the Light-CT scanner use for tissue structural observation.
* the four step is to check the preservation of morphological structure of tissue under the effect of laser excitation from the medical device.
