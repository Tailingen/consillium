Intensity-Modulated External Beam Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer
RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays and other types of radiation to kill tumor cells. Specialized radiation therapy, such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy, that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue.

PURPOSE: This clinical trial studies intensity-modulated external beam radiation therapy in treating patients with prostate cancer.
Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate|Stage I Prostate Cancer|Stage II Prostate Cancer|Stage III Prostate Cancer|Stage IV Prostate Cancer
RADIATION: intensity modulated external beam radiation therapy
Toxicity as measured by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v3 criteria, At 2 years
Biochemical failure as defined by the Phoenix definition, 2 years
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To demonstrate that patients can safely receive IMRT teletherapy using the proposed IMRT fractionation schedule without experiencing a treatment limiting toxicity.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To assess treatment efficacy through the surrogate measures of PSA nadir and biochemical failure-free survival.

OUTLINE: Patients undergo hypofractionated intensity modulated radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with intermediate- and high-risk disease may also receive concurrent and adjuvant or long-term androgen deprivation therapy for up to 36 months. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4-6 weeks, every 4 months for 3 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually until year 5.
