Treatment of Intraocular Retinoblastoma
This study compares the effects of balloon technology and microcatheter technology on the eye protection rate of neuroblastoma
Retinoblastoma
PROCEDURE: Balloon technology;Microcatheter technology
Overall success rate, To evaluate the 1-year ocular salvage rate in the treatment of retinoblastoma \[ Time Frame: 1 year \] 12-month ocular salvage rate: calculate the number and percentage of subjects who reach 12-month ocular salvage rate, and use the exact probability method to estimate 95% CI., 1 year|Second tumor rate, To evaluate the 1-year recurrence of the tumor., 1 year
Retinoblastoma is the most common intraocular malignant tumor in childhood, with an incidence of about 1/15,000-20,000, accounting for 4% of all childhood cancers. All patients with bilateral reticuloblastoma and approximately 10%-15% of children with unilateral disease have germline mutations that can be passed on to their offspring.In developed countries, the survival rate is close to 98%. However, due to the limitations of health care in low-income countries, this proportion is much lower, about 40%. Before the 1990s, retinoblastoma was mainly treated with enucleation and external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). However, these methods are associated with many complications, including vision loss and serious side effects. At present, the first-line conservative treatment of retinoblastoma has changed from EBRT and enucleation to Intravenous chemotherapy (IVC) or intra-arterial chemotherapy (IAC), and it has been consolidated through focal treatment. There are two different surgical procedures for intra-arterial chemotherapy, namely balloon technique and microcatheter technique. Investigators observe their effects through a retrospective case-control study.
