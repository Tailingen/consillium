Anlotinib Plus Docetaxel for the Treatment of EGFR Wild-type Advanced Non-small-cell Lung Cancer
Anlotinib is a multi-target receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor in domestic research and development. It can inhibit the angiogenesis related kinase, such as VEGFR, FGFR, PDGFR, and tumor cell proliferation related kinase -c-Kit kinase. In the phase â…¢ study, patients who failed at least two kinds of systemic chemotherapy (third line or beyond) or drug intolerance were treated with anlotinib or placebo, the anlotinib group PFS and OS were 5.37 months and 9.63 months, the placebo group PFS and OS were 1.4 months and 6.3 months. Therefore,we envisage using anlotinib plus docetaxel treat the EGFR wild-type advanced Non-small cell lung cancer patients who were failure in the treatment of chemotherapy with platinum containing drugs, to further improve the patient's PFS or OS.

PFS, Progress free survival, each 42 days up to PD or death(up to 24 months)
OS, Overall Survival, From randomization until death (up to 24 months)|ORR, Objective Response Rate, each 42 days up to intolerance the toxicity or PD (up to 24 months)|DCR, Disease Control Rate, each 42 days up to intolerance the toxicity or PD (up to 24 months)|Safety (Number of Participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability), Number of Participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, Until 21 day safety follow-up visit
This is a multicentre randomised controlled clinical trial conducted in China to compare the effectiveness and safety of Anlotinib Plus Docetaxel in patients of EGFR wild-type Advanced Non-squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.

Eligible patients will be randomized to arm A and arm B:

Arm A: Patients on the anlotinib and docetaxel arm received 75mg/m2 docetaxel as intravenous infusion on day 1 of a 21-day cycle and 12mg anlotinib orally daily on day 1to 14 of a 21-day cycle.

Arm B: Patients on the docetaxel arm received 75mg/m2 docetaxel as intravenous infusion on day 1 of a 21-day cycle.
