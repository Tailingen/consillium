Clinical Study of Safety and Efficacy of Universal PSMA CAR- T in Refractory CRPC
This is a single-arm, single-center, open-label clinical trial designed to evaluate the clinical safety and tolerability of different doses of Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA)-Universal Chimeric Antigen Receptor (UCAR) T-lymphocytes (PSMA-UCAR T) for the treatment of patients with refractory castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).

BIOLOGICAL: PSMA-UCAR T (BRL-302)
The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE V5.0), Safety assessment: toxicity profile, Through 6 months after CAR T cell infusion|Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) grading post CAR T cell infusion., Safety assessment: toxicity profile, Through 6 months after CAR T cell infusion|Safety assessment: dose-limiting toxicity, Incidence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) within 28 days. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as any relevant adverse event that ≥ grade 3 and did not resolve to a grade ≤ grade 2 within 28 days after the first infusion back., 28 days after CAR T cell infusion
Efficacy assessment: PSA changes, Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) changes assessed by serum PSA measurement (ng/ml)., 6 months after CAR T cell infusion|Efficacy assessment: radiographic Progression-Free Survival (rPFS), rPFS is defined as the time between treatment with study drug and the development of imaging progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, with imaging progression encompassing the evaluation of progression of primary lesions, non-regional lymph node invasion, soft tissue metastases, and bone metastatic lesions according to RECIST 1.1 and PCWG3 criteria., 6 months after CAR T cell infusion|6-months Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time between treatment with study drug and disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, including biochemical progression or radiographic progression after evaluation according to RECIST 1.1 and PCWG3 criteria according to the included., 6 months after CAR T cell infusion|Pharmacokinetics (PK) assessment: expansion of CAR T cells, With the day of the first infusion of the cellular preparation recorded as D0, the monitoring phase of the pharmacokinetic study started from 1 day before the first infusion (D-1).

Expansion of CAR T cells will be assessed by concentration profile of CAR-T cells in peripheral blood after PSMA-UCAR T infusion., From Day 1 till at least 3 months after CAR T cell infusion|Pharmacokinetics (PK) assessment: persistence of CAR T cells, With the day of the first infusion of the cellular preparation recorded as D0, the monitoring phase of the pharmacokinetic study started from 1 day before the first infusion (D-1).

Persistence of CAR T cells will be assessed by T-cell survival time (area under the curve AUC0-28 at 28 days and area under the curve AUC0-90 at 90 days);, From Day 1 till at least 3 months after CAR T cell infusion|Pharmacodynamics (PD) assessment eg. (Level of IL-6), Pharmacokinetic (PD) endpoints is assessed by changes in serum cytokine levels (eg.IL-6) after PSMA-UCAR T infusion., From Day 1 till at least 3 months after CAR T cell infusion
This is a single-arm, single-center, open-label clinical trial, which aims to evaluate safety and clinical efficacy of different doses of PSMA-UCAR T (BRL-302) in treating patients with refractory CRPC.

Three patients will be firstly enrolled at a dose level (DL) of 5.0 × 10\^6cells/kg in the DL1 group. Based on preliminary safety data, efficacy information, and PK/PD parameters obtained at DL1 cohort, the investigator may enroll another three patients in a decreased dose level group of DL-2: 3 × 10\^6 cells/kg or DL-1:1 × 10\^6 cells/ kg, after thorough discussions between the investigators.
