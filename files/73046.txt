INCB040093 and INCB040093 Combined With Itacitinib (INCB039110) in Relapsed/Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma
A Phase 2, open-label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of INCB040093 as monotherapy and as combination therapy with itacitinib (INCB039110) in subjects with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma.
Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma|Recurrent Adult Hodgkin's Lymphoma
DRUG: INCB040093 Monotherapy|DRUG: INCB040093|DRUG: itacitinib
Objective Response Rate (ORR) as determined by the percentage of subjects achieving a partial response (PR) or complete response (CR), Evaluate the efficacy of INCB040093 as monotherapy and when given in combination with itacitinib by assessing the objective response rate (ORR) determined by an independent review committee., Measured every 9 weeks from baseline until progression (estimated to be 12 months)
Percentage of participants reporting adverse events in the monotherapy group, Safety and tolerability of INCB040093 as monotherapy in subjects with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) as determined by clinical laboratory assessments, physical exams, 12-lead ECG and summary of adverse events, every 3 weeks for the duration of participation in the study [estimated to be 12 months]|Percentage of participants reporting adverse events in the combination therapy group, Safety and tolerability of INCB040093 when given in combination with itacitinib in subjects with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) as determined by clinical laboratory assessments, physical exams, 12-lead ECG and summary of adverse events, every 3 weeks for the duration of participation in the study [estimated to be 12 months]|Percentage of subjects achieving a complete response (CR) determined by the independent review committee and based on standard response criteria, Complete Response is determined by the independent review committee and based on standard response criteria defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) criteria. CR: Disappearance of all target and nontarget lesions., Week 36 disease evaluation|To evaluate the duration of response (DOR), Duration of response is defined as the time from the first assessment showing response (CR or PR) determined by the independent review committee to the first documented disease progression determined by the independent review committee or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Week 36 disease evaluation|To evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from first dose to the first documented disease progression or relapse as assessed by independent review committee or death from any cause., Week 36 disease evaluation
