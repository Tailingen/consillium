Avatrombopag for the Treatment of Chemotherapy-Induced Thrombocytopenia in Adults With Active Non-Hematological Cancers
Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of avatrombopag in subjects with chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia receiving chemotherapy for the treatment of ovarian, lung (small cell and non-small cell) and bladder cancer.
Chemotherapy-induced Thrombocytopenia
DRUG: Avatrombopag|DRUG: Placebo Oral Tablet
Percentage of Subjects Who do Not Require Platelet Transfusion, Dose Reduction in Chemotherapy by 15%, or Chemotherapy Delay by >=4 Days, Randomization up to 33 days
Duration of Severe Thrombocytopenia Defined as a Platelet Count <50 x 10^9/L, The duration of severe thrombocytopenia is defined as the total number of days with a platelet count \<50×10\^9/L during the period after post-chemotherapy study drug treatment in Cycle X+1 through Chemotherapy Day of Cycle X+2., Randomization up to 33 days|Change in Platelet Count From Baseline (Nadir), Comparison of avatrombopag 60 mg vs. placebo, adjusted for the number of chemotherapy agents currently receiving per IWRS (1, ≥2).

Cycle X nadir is defined as the lowest platelet count value prior to the first dose of study drug; Cycle X+1 nadir is defined as the lowest platelet count value during the period after post-chemotherapy study drug treatment in Cycle X+1 through Chemotherapy Day in Cycle X+2., Randomization up to 33 days|Percentage of Subjects Who Did Not Have Major or Non-major Clinically Relevant Bleeding During the Period After Post-chemotherapy Study Drug Treatment in Cycle X+1 Through Chemotherapy Day of Cycle X+2., Randomization up to 33 days
Subjects will receive placebo controlled test treatment for one cycle of chemotherapy followed by an observational cycle. Subjects will have the option to continue into an open label extension period for all remaining chemotherapy cycles within the current regimen. After the follow-up visit, all subjects will continue to a long-term safety follow-up period.
