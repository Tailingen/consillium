Efficacy and Safety of Trifluridine/tipiracil (TAS-102) Combined with Bevacizumab and Putalimab in the Treatment of Patients with MCRC After Cytoreductive Surgery: a Single-arm, Single-center Clinical Study
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant tumors. With the rapid development of China's economy, people's living standards have been significantly improved, and lifestyles and dietary structures have changed. Smoking, drinking, high-fat, high-energy diets, etc. have led to an increase in the incidence of colorectal cancer year by year. Data show that in 2022, there will be 510,000 new cases of colorectal cancer in China, and about 240,000 deaths related to colorectal cancer. Radical surgery is the main initial treatment for early and middle-stage colorectal cancer and some metastatic colorectal cancer. Although the level of surgical treatment of colorectal cancer has been greatly improved and can achieve cure for some patients, its 5-year overall survival rate is only about 60%, and the main cause of death is distant metastasis and recurrence. In recent years, with the in-depth understanding of the treatment mechanism of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), a variety of new treatment options have been proposed and applied in clinical practice in order to improve the quality of life of patients and prolong their survival.

Trifluridine/tipivirine (TAS-102) is a new type of cytotoxic drug that exerts anti-tumor effects by directly incorporating into DNA chains to destroy DNA function. Its mechanism of action is different from that of fluorouracil drugs, and it can resist 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) resistance, providing a new treatment option for mCRC patients. TAS-102 has been approved in China for mCRC patients who have previously received fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan-based chemotherapy, as well as those who have previously received or are not suitable for anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy and anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy (RAS wild type). Bevacizumab, as a monoclonal antibody targeting VEGF, exerts its anti-tumor effect by inhibiting tumor angiogenesis. Putlimumab, as an immune checkpoint inhibitor, enhances the body's immune response to tumors by blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway.

Combination therapy has attracted much attention due to its possible synergistic effect. Studies have shown that TAS-102 combined with bevacizumab can achieve longer overall survival (OS) than TAS-102 monotherapy. In addition, TAS-102 combined with bevacizumab for refractory mCRC has also been approved by the FDA, showing its potential and importance in the treatment of mCRC. Therefore, this study aims to explore the efficacy and safety of TAS-102 combined with bevacizumab and putelimab in patients with mCRC after cytoreductive surgery, in order to provide a more effective treatment for mCRC patients. Through the design of a single-arm, single-center clinical study, we can have a deeper understanding of the efficacy and safety of this combined treatment in a specific patient population, providing a scientific basis for future clinical applications.
Colorectal Cancer (CRC)
DRUG: Trifluridine/tipiracil (TAS-102) combined with bevacizumab and ptemizumab
Disease-free survival (DFS), The period from the beginning of treatment to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause. If such situation is not met, the last evaluation date shall be used for analysis. In addition, if the treatment is terminated without confirming the progress of the disease, the imaging examination and follow-up should also be carried out after the treatment is terminated., Two Years
Objective Remission Rate (ORR), The proportion of patients whose tumor volume has shrunk to a predetermined value and can maintain the minimum time limit. The remission period usually refers to the period from the beginning of curative effect to the confirmation of tumor progression. The objective response rate is generally defined as the sum of complete response plus partial response (CR+PR)., Two Years|Overall Survival (OS), The time from the date of treatment to the date of death due to any reason. For patients who survived in the final analysis, the date of the last contact will be recorded., Two Years|Treatment response, To evaluate tumor response using imaging examinations (CT/MRI) and tumor shrinkage rate using the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST 1.1)., Two Years|Incidence rate of adverse events, According to NCI CTCAE v5.0, Baseline before any treatment,3 months after any treatment
