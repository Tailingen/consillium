Exploratory, Phase 0 Study of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Imaging Agent, F-18 RGD-K5
The purpose of this research study is to get information from volunteers without cancer and patients with cancer who have received a new investigational study agent called, "\[F-18\] RGDK5," to evaluate biodistribution and dosimetry for the study agent and determine F-18 RGD-K5 uptake in angiogenic tumor. the system.

DRUG: F-18 RGD-K5
To collect bio-distribution data to calculate dosimetry values in normals and obtain and evaluate PET images in cancer subjects for resolution of [F-18]RGD-K5, imaging study-participation only days
\[F-18\]RGD-K5 is being investigated as a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical for the detection and localization of angiogenesis tissue or lesions supporting the application and role of integrins in anti-angiogenic therapies to benefit patients with cancer and inflammatory diseases.

The primary objectives of this exploratory study are:

* To gain information on biodistribution of \[F-18\]RGD-K5, and to evaluate the PET images with \[F-18\]RGD-K5 for resolution, signal to background ratio and for the detection and localization of angiogenesis tissue. This Exploratory Investigational New Drug (EIND) study is designed to obtain preliminary imaging and fundamental biodistribution, metabolism and safety information to demonstrate early proof of concept. The information collected under this study will not be used for diagnostic purposes, to assess the subject's response to therapy, or for clinical management for the subject.
