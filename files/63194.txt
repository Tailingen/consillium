Supporting Women With Breast Cancer to Practice DIBH at Home Before Radiation Therapy
To examine the effect of a preparatory digital tool including a new instruction for deep inspiration breath hold (DIBH), before start of radiation therapy in women diagnosed with left sided breast cancer, compared with usual care.
Health Literacy|Distress, Emotional|Preparedness|Mobile Application
OTHER: mobile application with breathing instructions and a sensor to attach around the chest. To be able to train at home before radiotherapy with DIBH starts.

HRQoL and Health economic (EQ-5D-5L), Health economic measured with EQ-5D-5L a health-related quality of life instrument used to calculate quality-adjusted life years (QALY) . Its design accounts for the need for a direct link between the measurement and valuation of health, whereby every health state that patients might report on the EQ-5D-5L instrument can be summarised by a single value. In order to be used in the calculation of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs; a metric used in cost-utility anal-ysis that combines survival and HRQL), these values need to summarise how good or bad each health state is on a scale anchored at 1 (full health) and 0 (a state equivalent to dead). Values less than 0 represent health states considered to be or modelled as worse than dead., at baseline when inclusion/randomisation|HRQoL and Health economic (EQ-5D-5L), Health economic measured with EQ-5D-5L a health-related quality of life instrument used to calculate quality-adjusted life years (QALY) .

Likert scale, ranging from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree., at baseline when inclusion/randomisation|Communicative, critical and functional HL, consists of 14 statements with 4 points Likert scales (1-4). The statements ask how often (never to often) patients have trouble with reading or understanding leaflets from healthcare providers/hospital or pharmacy (functional health literacy; 5 items), have difficulty (easy to rather difficult) performing certain actions in relation to health information (communicative (5 items) and critical (4 items) health literacy)., at baseline when inclusion/randomisation|Preparedness(PCSQ-24), Modified version of the Preparedness for Colorectal Cancer Surgery Questionnaire, with 28 items measuring preparedness for surgery was developed covering four domains.All items were rated on a Likert-type scale with the following translated response options: Strongly agree, Agree somewhat, Disagree somewhat, and Totally disagree (with corresponding values ranging from 4 to 1), at CT planning visit, one week|The Radiotherapy Experience Questionnaire, Swedish modified version, The Radiotherapy Experience Questionnaire (RTEQ) with 23 items.

Thorax extension: chest mobility will be measured with a measuring tape, during maximum breathing movements, with the addition of voluntary movements of the chest(the measurement is in centimeters and millimeters), at planning CT, one week|RMMI test, Respiratory movements will be measured on ten patients in the pilot-test, from group B with the Respiratory Movement Measuring Instrument (RMMI) (ReMo Inc. Keldnaholt, Reykjavik, Iceland). The measurement will be performed during maximum breathing movements and is measured bilaterally in the upper and lower part of the thorax and the abdomen. The measurement will be performed by a physiotherapist in the project. The test will evaluate if the measurement with logged data in the app and the respiratory objective measurements are reliable measurements. If not, this measurement will be done to patients in the group B in the RCT study to evaluate the effect., at planning CT visit, one week|Planned and given absorbed RT dose to the heart during RT, Given and planned RT-heart dose will be obtained from the journal.

Participants are selected within each group with a view to a spread of age, socio-demographic characteristics, and treatment approach., 3 weeks post RT
The following questions will be posted:

* Are there any differences in levels of distress (primary outcome) between the control and intervention group at baseline and over time?
* Are there any differences in preparedness for RT (secondary outcomes) between the control and intervention group at baseline and over time?
* Are there any correlations between Health Literacy (HL) levels (secondary outcome) and levels of distress (primary outcome) in the control and intervention group?
* Are there any differences in objective clinical variables (chest mobility and respiratory movements and planned absorbed dose to the heart) between the control and intervention group before and after the intervention (baseline and at planning CT)?
* Which patterns of practice and use of the application (when, how, how often and for how long) can be discerned from the intervention group?
* Are there any correlations between different levels of practice and use of the digital tool and primary and secondary outcomes?
* How do patients in the different groups (control and intervention group) describe their experience of care and information process during RT with DIBH?
* Are there differences regarding health economic variables in terms of costs and health care usage (e.g., estimated time for planning and conducting computed tomography (CT), number of scheduled CT examinations) and patient effects (e.g. co-morbidities (heart related), sick leave, and quality-adjusted life year (QALYs) between patients in control- or interventions group?
* Are there any differences regarding effects on environmental aspects and costs in the different groups (control and intervention)?
