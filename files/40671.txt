Multi-Center Study Protocol: Impact of Sarcopenia in Early-Onset Colorectal Cancer.
Sarcopenia's role in early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC), a subtype increasingly diagnosed in individuals under 50 years, has not yet been investigated according to recent literature.

Understanding the prevalence and prognostic impact of sarcopenia in EOCRC could inform tailored therapeutic approaches and improve patient outcomes.

As reported by the GLOBOCAN study, EOCRC occurs in individuals younger than 50 years old. According to the GLOBOCAN estimates, there were 188,069 new cases of EOCRC, with an Age Standardized Incidence Rate (ASRs) of 2.9 per 100,000 person-years worldwide. Recent evidence suggested an increasing incidence rate for EOCRC in different populations, with greater changes in both developed and developing countries. Despite the declining trend in the incidence of CRC in the total population of the developed countries, the incidence rates for EOCRC were increasing both in the developed and developing world. Sarcopenia's role in early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC), a subtype increasingly diagnosed in individuals under 50 years, remains underexplored.
