Comparison of Erector Spina Plane Block and Thoracic Epidural Block
The aim of this randomised controlled and double-blind study, is to compare the effects of erector spinae plane (ESP) and thoracic epidural (TEA) blocks on peri-operative hemodynamics and analgesia in patients undergoing unilateral mastectomies due to malignancy.
Breast Neoplasms|Pain, Postoperative
OTHER: Erector spina plane block before general anaesthesia|OTHER: Thoracic epidural block before general anaesthesia
Sympathetic block level evaluation with skin conductivity, Skin conductivity will be measured by galvanic skin response (GSR), 45 minutes after block administration|Sympathetic block level evaluation with skin temperature, Skin temperature of bilateral thorax will be measured, 45 minutes after block administration|Sympathetic block level evaluation with hot cold test, Hot cold test of bilateral thorax will be measured, 45 minutes after block administration|Sympathetic block level evaluation by hemodynamic data, Peri-operative heart rate and mean arterial pressure will be recorded, 45 minutes after block administration|Sensorial block level evaluation, By pin-prick test, 45 minutes after block administration
intraoperative hemodynamic data, Heart rate and mean arterial pressure, During the operation|Postoperative pain scores, Pain score will be measured with visual analog scale (0-no pain; 10-worst pain) during movement and rest., 24 hours after operation|Rescue analgesics consumption, Amount of remifentanil (microgram), During the operation and 24 hours after operation|Rescue analgesics consumption, Amount of tramadol (milligram), 24 hours after operation
Patients will be randomised into two groups as Group E (those who received general anesthesia after the erector spina plan block) and Group T (those who received general anesthesia after thoracic epidural block).

After the block skin conductivity (galvanic skin response - GSR), body temperature changes, sympathetic and sensory block levels, peri-operative hemodynamic data, postoperative pain scores and analgesic consumption will be recorded.
