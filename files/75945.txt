A Study of Immunotherapy With TIL (Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes) in Combination With Intra-tumoral Injections of Interferon Gamma-adenovirus (Ad-IFNg) in Patients With Stage IIIc or Stage IV Metastatic Melanoma (AJCC)(Protocol TIL-Ad-INFg)
The main objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical and biologic toxicity of cell therapy by adoptive transfer of TIL in combination with intra-tumoral injections of Ad-INFg.
