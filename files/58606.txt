Phase III Trial to Evaluate the Elortinib vs Gefitinib in Advanced NSCLC With EGFR Exon 19 or 21 Mutations
This is a randomized controlled trial to compare efficacy and safety between erlotinib and gefitinib in advanced NSCLC harboring EGFR exon 19 or 21 mutations.Eligible patients were randomized to receive erlotinib or gefitinib in any line settings.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS).
Thoracic Neoplasms
DRUG: erlotinib|DRUG: gefitinib
progression-free survival, two years
overall survival, three years|Safety events, two years|Pharmacoeconomic, two years|Response rate, one year
Patients with stage IV NSCLC who have EGFR exon 19 or 21 mutations will randomized to received oral erlotinib 150mg or gefitinib 250mg once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Method of direct DNA sequencing of tumor tissue is used to analysis EGFR mutation status of exons 18-21. The response will be evaluated by RECIST criteria first month,second month and then repeat every 3 months after the beginning of the treatment weeks.
