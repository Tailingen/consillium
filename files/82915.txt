Molecular Genetic and Pathological Studies of Anal Tumors
Study the Genetics of Anal Cancer
Rectal Cancer|Colon Cancer|Colonic Neoplasms|Anal Cancer
OTHER: genetic analysis
Genetic analysis of blood sample as well as tissues , will provide us with any possible tumor marker for a better prognostic indicator., Annual assessment.
To determine the status of previously identified anal cancer molecular markers and any correlations with outcome as well as to discover new molecular biomarkers through correlating molecular data with clinical outcome. Study of tissue samples and cells from biopsies of your lesion and blood sample. We hope to learn the role genes and proteins may play in the development of anal cancer. Experiments will be performed using this tissue and blood, include analysis of DNA, analysis of RNA expression levels, analysis of protein levels of important gene products, and development of tissue culture cell lines.
