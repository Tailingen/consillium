Immunology Markers Concentrations Were Examined as an Exploratory Endpoint. The Change From Baseline Was Reported., Distribution of lymphocyte subsets from peripheral blood was determined by flow cytometry. Flow cytometry is a laser-based technique used to detect and measure physical and chemical characteristics of a population of cells or particles. It allows simultaneous multi-parameter analysis of single cells.

The selected markers of interest, representative of the broader markers were: Total Thymus-cells (T-Cells), Cluster of Differentiation 4 (CD4) T cell subsets, and Cluster of Differentiation 9 (CD8) T cell subset, CD4 T Regulatory (T Reg) cells, Natural Killer Cells, Activated T cells, Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells (MSCDs), Monocytes. The Percent Gated and Absolute counts were analysed for each marker. Gating allows the analysis to be restricted to a specific size of cells (e.g. lymphocytes) to allow a more specific analysis. Absolute counting quantifies the total number of cells. It is recommended to look at both values to get the full picture., Baseline, 10 days post-treatment|Skin Photosensitivity as a Adverse Event of Special Interest: Participants With Event, Adverse Event of special interest was Skin Photosensitivity. Skin photosensitivity was examined because all subjects who receive Photofrin are photosensitive and must observe precautions to avoid exposure of eyes and skin to direct sunlight or bright indoor lights for 30 days or longer. Changes in skin will be assessed by grade of erythema, edema and blistering and will be tabulated by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade in the dermatology/skin category., Up to 6 months
Lung cancer accounts for almost one-third of cancer deaths. Cancer screening strategies have the potential to achieve a 20% reduction in death rates. Newly developed bronchoscopic technologies (such as navigational bronchoscopy) have shown to enable physicians to safely reach lesions in peripheral regions of the lung and obtain diagnosis. This new technology may now potentially offer bronchoscopic therapeutic interventions, such as photodynamic therapy, to tumors that were previously unreachable due to their peripheral anatomic location.

Photodynamic therapy (PDT) uses a combination of a photosensitizing drug (a drug that is activated by light), called porfimer sodium (PhotofrinÂ®), and a light from a laser that emits no heat. This technique works to allow the medical doctor to specifically target and destroy abnormal or cancer cells while limiting damage to surrounding healthy tissue. The activation of the drug is done by lighting the abnormal area using a fiber optic device (very fine fiber \[like a fishing line\] that permits light transmission) inserted into a flexible tube called bronchoscope. The light activates the porfimer sodium, which is concentrated in the abnormal tissue, leading to its destruction.

The purpose of this study is to determine if physicians can reach the tumors in the periphery of the lung via electronavigational bronchoscopy and deliver the photodynamic therapy by placing the optical fiber into the tumor.
