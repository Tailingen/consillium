Predictive and Prognostic Value of Inflammatory Markers and microRNA in Stage IV Colorectal Cancer
This study investigates the predictive and prognostic values of inflammatory markers and microRNA in stage IV colorectal cancer. The expression of inflammatory markers and microRNA in plasma will be correlated with tumor location, with dietary patterns and with survival during treatment.
Colorectal Cancer Stage IV
Level of inflammatory markers, Level of C-reactive protein (CRP), Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), serum albumin, fibrinogen, haptoglobin, lymphocyte monocyte ratio (LMR), neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelets lymphocytes ratio (PLR), At diagnosis before chemotherapy|microRNA expression Level, miR-21, miR-19a, miR-155, miR-200c, miR-210, miR-126, miR-345, miR-31, miR-29a, miR-200b, and miR-203, At diagnosis before chemotherapy
Dietary pattern, Associations of dietary patterns (such as the Mediterranean diet and DII) with inflammatory markers, and microRNA expression, At diagnosis before chemotherapy and every 3 months
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is responsible for 10% of the world-wide cancer incidence and mortality. Recent data have shown that tumors arising from different regions of the colon differ in their molecular characteristics which causes translate into a differential clinical outcome.Several studies described the role of microRNA expression in the initiation and progression of CRC and its response to different therapeutic strategies. Other studies have shown that systemic inflammation is a key determinant role of clinico-pathological outcomes in patients with CRC. We therefore aim to evaluate the expression of selected microRNA and inflammatory markers in patients with stage IV colorectal cancer and assess their correlation with tumor location, dietary patterns, survival rates, response to systemic chemotherapy and other clinic-pathological parameters. We believe that identifying a predictive and prognostic panel made up of circulating microRNA and inflammatory markers may perhaps explain the difference in outcome between right and left colon and perhaps impact the clinical practice in patients with stage IV colorectal cancer.
