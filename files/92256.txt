BIOLOGICAL: 3F8/GM-CSF Immunotherapy Plus 13-Cis-Retinoic
Assess the Activity of High-dose 3F8/GM-CSF, against persistent neuroblastoma in bone marrow of patients who have no other evidence of disease by standard studies., 2 years
Apply Real-time Quantitative RT-PCR, to test the hypothesis that the minimal residual disease content of bone marrow after the first treatments with 3F8/GMCSF has significant prognostic impact on progression-free survival., 2 years|Monitor Safety of the High-dose Antibody Treatment, to assure no side-effects or noxious sequelae develop or emerge that were not seen in the prior phase I study., 2 years
