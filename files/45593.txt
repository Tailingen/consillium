PROOFS-Registry - Premenopausal Women With Breast Cancer Optimally Treated With OFS
There is only limited data for premenopausal patients in general, as well as for differences in the use of OFS in the subgroups of pre- and perimenopausal patients, respectively. The WSG ADAPT trial data on the impact of postmenopausal status and/or use of OFS within 3-4 weeks endocrine induction therapy show relevant impact of OFS/postmenopausal status on Ki-67 response; also, secondary amenorrhea after (neo-)adjuvant chemotherapy was a positive predictor of outcome due to OFS \[8, 9\].

This registry will give insights in the real-world use of OFS and the effect of secondary amenorrhea in female pre- and perimenopausal patients with or without previous use of chemotherapy and with different endocrine treatments (ET +/- GnRH).

As adherence over time (5-10 years) plays a major role in the endocrine treatment, the registry will follow patients' treatments for up to 10 years and include QoL information.

Results of MammaPrint® (MammaPrint® Index) as indicating factor for chemotherapy use and risk classification, thus, choice of adjuvant treatment (chemotherapy, OFS combined with endocrine therapy, or endocrine therapy alone) will be correlated to outcome under real-world conditions.

Baseline, treatment, and relapse data shall be collected to gain further insight in the treatment paths, treatment adherence, and outcome of such patients.

This registry aims

* to confirm an excellent outcome in pre-/perimenopausal patients treated by endocrine therapy (+ ovarian suppression) in patients with low genomic risk by MammaPrint® without chemotherapy use in a real-world setting.
* to evaluate management of ovarian function in patients treated by adjuvant chemotherapy according to investigator decision.
* to evaluate adherence to endocrine therapy (+/- ovarian function suppression).
* to evaluate the prognostic impact of clinicopathological markers (e.g., estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), HER2 receptor, Ki-67 at baseline and after preoperative endocrine therapy (if any performed) by local pathology assessment compared to genomic signature result.
* to assess the course of quality of life (QLQ BR23 and QLQ-C30) until 5 years of treatment with OFS (Baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, 5 years)

In general, WSG aim to assess the quality of surveillance care in younger breast cancer patients. WSG want to gain knowledge about endocrine induction treatment for indication of chemotherapy followed by endocrine treatment or endocrine treatment alone. Also, WSG aim at changes in duration of endocrine treatment (especially in high-risk patients up to 10 years) and introduction of intensified endocrine therapy (OFS) in combination with GnRH-analogues since publication of the SOFT and TEXT trials.
