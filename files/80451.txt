Pancreatic Cancer Recurrence in the Netherlands
The aim of this nationwide, observational cohort study is to evaluate current surveillance strategies after primary resection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in the Netherlands, with regard to the detection, treatment and survival of PDAC recurrence.
Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma|Pancreatic Cancer|Pancreas Cancer|PDAC
Incidence of PDAC recurrence, Incidence of PDAC recurrence within the Netherlands; PDAC recurrence is either pathologically proven, or suspected through cross-sectional imaging, preferably confirmed by consensus during a multidisciplinary meeting., Within a follow-up period up to 5 years|Patterns of PDAC recurrence, * Asymptomatic vs. symptomatic: Symptomatic recurrence is defined as the presence of symptoms suggestive for PDAC recurrence at recurrence diagnosis. If PDAC recurrence is detected in absence of suspected symptoms, disease recurrence was defined as asymptomatic.
* First site of recurrence: isolated local recurrence, liver-only, lung-only, multiple-site, other isolated distant
* Early vs. late recurrence: disease-free survival â‰¥12 months vs. \<12 months, Within a follow-up period up to 5 years|Treatment of PDAC recurrence, Either systemic and/or local treatment or best-supportive-care, Within a follow-up period up to 5 years|Survival, Overall survival (from the time of resection), disease-free survival (from the time of resection), post-recurrence survival (from the time of recurrence diagnosis), Within a follow-up period up to 5 years
Presence of symptoms at time of (suspected) recurrence, Which symptoms are associated with PDAC recurrence?, Within a follow-up period up to 5 years|Performance score at time of recurrence detection, What is the ECOG performance score of patients at time of recurrence diagnosis?, Within a follow-up period up to 5 years|Use of imaging procedures during follow-up, How much imaging procedures are performed during postoperative follow-up for the detection of PDAC recurrence? Are these procedures routinely performed?, Within a follow-up period up to 5 years|Number of histologically confirmed recurrences, How often is PDAC recurrence histologically confirmed?, Within a follow-up period up to 5 years
