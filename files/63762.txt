Nimotuzumab for Recurrent Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
The study assessed the clinical efficacy, and safety of the combination of Nimotuzumab administered concomitantly with intensity modulated radiation therapy(IMRT) in patients with recurrent nasopharyngeal cancer.
Recurrent Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
DRUG: Nimotuzumab
Tumor response rate after Nimotuzumab concurrent with radiotherapy for recurrent NPC patients, The response status (Complete Response + Partial Response) was evaluated according to RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) criteria. Complete response was defined as disappearance of all target lesions, and Partial response was defined as at least a 30% reduction in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline study., Three month after patients subject to the treatment|Toxicity of this combined treatment for recurrent NPC patients, Adverse events of this combined modality treatment were graded according to CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) v3.0 criteria.Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0, Three month after patients subject to the treatment
Local Progression free survival, Three years|Disease-free survival, Defined as the time in month from all treatment were finished to the date of disease progress is observed., Three years|Overall survival, Defined as the time in month from diagnosis of recurrent NPC to the date of death is observed or to last follow-up visit., Three years
The clinical efficacy of Nimotuzumab combined with radiotherapy has been shown in advanced nasopharyngeal cancer, which was significantly higher than radiotherapy alone. The efficacy of radiotherapy combined with Nimotuzumab has not been confirmed in recurrent nasopharyngeal cancer.In this study, Phase II clinical trials were performed. The patients were treated with Nimotuzumab which were used concurrently with IMRT. The efficacy and toxicity will be assessed.
