Bevacizumab Plus MFOLFOXIRI As First-line Treatment for Patients with Unresectable Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
The current clinical trials and data on the triplet regimen combined with bevacizumab for first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer were from European and American populations. The triplet regimens recommended by the NCCN and ESMO guidelines using irinotecan and 5-FU at a higher dose intensity cause a high incidence of adverse events in Asian population, and there was no high-quality data on efficacy in Chinese population, both of which have limited the clinical applications of the regimens in China. This study intends to conduct an improved triplet regimen (mFOLFOXIRI) combined with bevacizumab versus mFOLFOX6 combined with bevacizumab as a first-line multicenter, randomized, controlled phase III clinical trial in patients with advanced colorectal cancer. Progression-free survival (PFS), observable response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), disease control rate (DCR), surgical resection rate, and safety and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) were assessed in the two groups of subjects.
Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: mFOLFOXIRI plus Bevacizumab|DRUG: mFOLFOX6 Plus Bevacizumab
Progression-free survival (PFS), The PFS is defined as the time from the start of treatment to the date of first documented PD or death as a result of any cause, whichever occurred first., 2 years
Objective response rate (ORR), The percentage of subjects with total number of Complete Response (CR) + total number of Partial Response (PR)., 2 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from date of randomization to death due to any cause. Subjects still alive at the time of analysis were censored at their last date of last contact., 5 years|Toxicity assessed using the NCI common toxicity criteria, version 5.0., The grade of toxicity will be assessed using the NCI common toxicity criteria, version 5.0., 2 years
