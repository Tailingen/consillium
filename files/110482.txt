Intra-operative Pancreatoscopy in Patients With IPMN
To demonstrate the added value of intraoperative pancreatoscopy in patients undergoing partial pancreatic resection for the treatment of Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasm (IPMN) as it pertains to detection of discontinuous (skip) lesions in the remnant pancreas; to generate a hypothesis for a subsequent randomized control trial.
Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasm
DEVICE: SpyGlass
Rate of detection of discontinuous (skip) lesions along the main pancreatic duct, Rate of detection of discontinuous (skip) lesions along the main pancreatic duct of patients with IPMN using intraoperative pancreatoscopy based on visual impression of IPMN and/or pancreatoscopy guided biopsies, During index procedure
Technical success, Ability to advance the pancreatoscope along the entire main pancreatic duct length or until clinically needed; to visualize the potential lesion(s); or to obtain a tissue sample with SpyBite where applicable, During index procedure|Adverse Event Evaluation, Evaluate all serious adverse events related to the intraoperative pancreatoscopy procedure and/or device, Five years|Recurrence, Recurrence of IPMN within 5 years post-surgery evaluated with regular MRI or alternative radiological method, Five years|Comparison of visual and biopsy diagnosis, Comparison based on exploration with Spy Glass of the resected specimen, During index procedure|Inter-observer correspondence of visual impression of IPMN, Based on intra-operative impression and on review of recorded pancreatoscopy images/videos, During index procedure
The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the added value of intraoperative pancreatoscopy in patients undergoing partial pancreatic resection for the treatment of Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasm (IPMN) as it pertains to detection of discontinuous (skip) lesions in the remnant pancreas. A secondary study objective is to generate a hypothesis for a subsequent randomized controlled trial comparing diagnostic accuracy of intra-operative pancreatoscopy and SpyBiteâ„¢ with the diagnostic accuracy of intra-operative frozen section in patients undergoing resection
