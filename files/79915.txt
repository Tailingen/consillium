Conditioning Treatment With Umbilical Cord Blood Transplant for Hematologic Malignancies
This is a phase II study to assess the day 180 event free and overall survival after administration of a specified combination of fludarabine, busulfan, Total Body Irradiation (TBI), and thymoglobulin reduced intensity conditioning and 2 unit UCB stem cell transplant in a single institution setting in patients with hematologic malignancies for whom allogeneic transplantation is indicated.
