Flutamide In the Prevention of Prostate Cancer in Patients With Neoplasia of the Prostate
RATIONALE: Chemoprevention therapy is the use of certain drugs such as flutamide to try to prevent the development of cancer. Flutamide may be effective in the prevention of prostate cancer.

PURPOSE: Randomized clinical trial to study the effectiveness of flutamide in preventing prostate cancer in patients who have neoplasia of the prostate.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: flutamide|OTHER: placebo
Determine the ability of flutamide to reduce the incidence of prostate cancer, Up to 10 years
Overall survival, Up to 10 years|Assess the quality of life of these patients, Up to 10 years
OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the ability of flutamide to reduce the incidence of prostate cancer in patients with high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. II. Determine the effect of this regimen on a series of endpoint biomarkers in these patients. III. Assess the quality of life of these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age (under 65 versus 65 and over), PSA (0-2.5 versus 2.6-4.0 versus 4.1-10 versus greater than 10 ng/mL), PIN (on one biopsy versus on two biopsies), and family history (prostate cancer in brother, father, or uncle versus no prostate cancer in these relatives). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.
