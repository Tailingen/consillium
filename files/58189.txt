Prospective Study on the Clinical Prognosis of Bilateral Central Lymph Node Dissection in the Patients With Unilateral Thyroid Papillary Carcinoma
This study recruit the patients with unilateral papillary thyroid cancer before operation,the patients agree to enter the test,and divided into experimental and control group.experimental group patients receive the surgery including unilateral thyroid lobectomy and bilateral central lymph node dissection.and control group receive the surgery including unilateral thyroid lobectomy and unilateral central lymph node dissection.last the investigators compare numbers of patient with tumor recurrence and metastasis rate of 5 years,numbers of metastatic lymph node,and numbers of participants with adverse events related to treatment between two groups in order to evaluate the significance of bilateral lymph node dissection.
Thyroid Papillary Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: surgery：BCND（bilateral central lymph node dissection）|PROCEDURE: surgery：UCND（unilateral central lymph node dissection）
tumor recurrence, numbers of patients with tumor recurrence, 5 years|numbers of metastatic lymph node, numbers of metastatic lymph node, 1 years|adverse events related to treatment, numbers of participants with adverse events including recurrent nerve injury，parathyroid injury，hemorrhage, 1 years
relations between the lymph metastasis and TNM staging, Coefficient R (SPSS software for correlation analysis), 1 years|relations between the lymph metastasis and tumor location, Coefficient R (SPSS software for correlation analysis), 1 years
