QUILT-3.052: NANT Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) Vaccine: Combination Immunotherapy in Subjects With Relapsed CD20-positive NHL
This is a phase 1b/2 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of metronomic combination therapy in subjects with with CD20-positive NHL who have progressed on or after rituximab therapy.

Treatment will be administered in 2 phases, an induction and a maintenance phase, as described below. Subjects will continue induction treatment for up to 1 year or until they experience progressive disease (PD) or experience unacceptable toxicity (not correctable with dose reduction), withdraw consent, or if the Investigator feels it is no longer in the subject's best interest to continue treatment. Those who have a complete response (CR) in the induction phase will enter the maintenance phase of the study. Subjects may remain on the maintenance phase of the study for up to 1 year. Treatment will continue in the maintenance phase until the subject experiences PD or unacceptable toxicity (not correctable with dose reduction), withdraws consent, or if the Investigator feels it is no longer in the subject's best interest to continue treatment.
