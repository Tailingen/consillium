Intra-operative Variation in Size of Brain Tumors After Craniotomy
We planned to evaluate the change in tumor dimensions of intraaxial parenchymal tumors after craniotomy by comparing the tumor size on intraoperative ultrasonography (IOUSG) with pre-operative CECT and CEMRI brain.
Brain Tumor, Primary
Tumor dimension change, Change in tumor dimension, surface area and volume when comparing intraoperative ultrasound with pre-operative CEMRI and CECT brain, March 2018 to November 2019
Tumor distance from dural surface, Change in the distance of tumor from dural surface as measured on intraoperative ultrasound when comparing it with pre-operative CEMRI and CECT brain, March 2018 to November 2019|Relationship of tumor size change with other characteristics, Relationship of tumor size change with tumor consistency, tumor characteristics, histopathology, tumor location, March 2018 to November 2019
Background: No previous study to determine the intraoperative changes in the tumor dimensions had been undertaken previously. Objectives: We planned to evaluate the change in tumor dimensions of intraaxial parenchymal tumors after craniotomy by comparing the tumor size on intraoperative ultrasonography (IOUSG) with pre-operative CECT and CEMRI brain. Study Design: This was a prospective observational study. Participants: Patients aged 15-65 years undergoing surgery at SKIMS for intraaxial parenchymal intracranial tumors were included. Methods: Standard pre-operative CECT and CEMRI brain were done to measure tumor dimensions and compared with IOUSG.
