Safety and Preliminary Efficacy of BNT314 in Cancer Patients With Malignant Solid Tumors
The purpose of this first-in-human study is to find out if BNT314 is safe when it is used alone in patients with different types of cancer.

This is a dose escalation study in which patients will be assigned to multiple dose levels (DLs) of BNT314 given alone. By escalating the dose with a small group of patients, the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) which is the highest dose with acceptable safety and manageable side effects, or the maximum administered dose (MAD) will be investigated.

Geometric means of area under the concentration-time curve from pre-dose to last quantifiable time point prior to the next dose (AUClast), In patients receiving at least one dose of BNT314 per cohort and are evaluable for pharmacokinetic assessments, from pre-dose to 21 days after study treatment for Cycle 1 and Cycle 2|Geometric means of area under the concentration-time curve from pre-dose to the end of the dosing period (AUCtau), In patients receiving at least one dose of BNT314 per cohort and are evaluable for pharmacokinetic assessments, from pre-dose to 21 days after study treatment for Cycle 1 and Cycle 2|Geometric means of maximum concentration (Cmax) from pre-dose to the end of the dosing period, In patients receiving at least one dose of BNT314 per cohort and are evaluable for pharmacokinetic assessments, from pre-dose to 21 days after study treatment for Cycle 1 and Cycle 2|Number and percentage of patients who developed detectable anti-drug antibody (ADA) from baseline to the end of study treatment, In patients receiving at least one dose of BNT314 per cohort, from pre-dose to 90 days after last dose of study treatment|Disease control rate (DCR) based on investigator's tumor assessment according to RECIST 1.1, Reported with number and percentage of patients with a CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) (assessed at least 6 weeks after first dose of study treatment) as best overall response. In patients receiving at least one dose of BNT314, up to 3 years after first dose of study treatment|Objective response rate (ORR) based on investigator's tumor assessment according to RECIST 1.1, Reported with number and percentage of patients with a confirmed CR or PR as best overall response. In patients receiving at least one dose of BNT314., up to 3 years after first dose of study treatment|Duration of response (DOR) based on investigator's tumor assessment according to RECIST 1.1, DOR is defined as the time from first objective response (CR or PR) to first occurrence of objective tumor progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. In patients receiving at least one dose of BNT314., up to 3 years after first dose of study treatment
This is a multicenter, multinational safety study in patients with metastatic or advanced malignant solid tumors for whom, at the discretion of the investigator, there is no available standard therapy likely to confer clinical benefit, evaluating the safety, tolerability, preliminary antitumor activity, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and immunogenicity of BNT314.

During dose escalation, BNT314 will be administered to patients via one infusion in periodic cycles.

Additional cohorts (backfill cohorts) administering BNT314 as monotherapy will assign patients to specific DLs, based on the emerging safety, PK, and pharmacodynamic data. This would allow for further assessment of dose- and exposure-response relationships for clinical activity, safety, and tolerability to support BNT314 dose optimization.

The treatment period will last until progressive disease (PD), confirmed PD (as per immune response evaluation criteria in solid tumors \[iRECIST\]), unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent, whichever happens first.

The maximum duration of BNT314 administration in this study is 2 years.
