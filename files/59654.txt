35kDa Hyaluronan Fragment Treatment of Colorectal and Rectal Cancer
HA35 (Bioactive HA or B-HA or HA35) have good tissue permeability (B-HA injection, Ministry of Health, Registration number L20200708MP07707). HA35 might not lose HA's bioactivities of binding to a variety of hyaluronan's binding proteins or receptors, including the analgesic and anticancer effects of hyaluronan, therefore being named bioactive HA or B-HA (10) (B-HA injection, Ministry of Health, Registration number L20200708MP07707).
Cancer Pain
DRUG: HA35
Numerical Rating Scale, A numerical rating scale (NRS) from 0 to 10 was used to assess the pain after 1 hour, 3 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours and 72 hours of the injection. Each patient rates their pain on a scale of 0 to 10, where a score of 0 means "no pain" and 10 means "the most painful". More specifically, 0 points indicates no pain; 1-3 points can be interpreted as slight and bearable pain; 4-6 points can be interpreted as pain that affects sleep but is still tolerable; and 7-10 points can be interpreted as intense and unbearable pain that affects sleep or other activities., 1 hour, 3 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours and 72 hours
The previous study has shown that naked mole rat who has high tissue content of hyaluronan and its fragments is insensitive to pain. The previous study has also shown that hyaluronan modulates pain-regulated TRPV1 channel opening, reducing peripheral nociceptor activity and pain. The previous study has again shown that local injection of 35kDa hyaluronan fragment HA35 is effective in treating inflammatory and neuropathic pain. This study employs freshly made HA35 injection for treatment of pain associated with radiotherapy for treatment of colorectal and rectal cancer. A numerical rating scale from 0 to 10 was used to assess the pain after 1 hour, 3 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours and 72 hours of the injection.
