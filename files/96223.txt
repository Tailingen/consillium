Incidence and Resolution of Eribulin-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy
Study E7389-M044-504 is an observational, post-authorization, single-arm, prospective, multicenter cohort study conducted to characterize and determine the incidence of eribulin-induced peripheral neuropathy (PN), and the frequency and time to resolution of eribulin-induced PN in adult participants treated with eribulin in a real-life setting with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MBC) who have progressed following at least one and up to three chemotherapeutic regimens for advanced disease.
Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Eribulin
