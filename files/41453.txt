The study is conducted in two parts. In the Dose Escalation portion of the trial, subjects are enrolled into cohorts at increasing dose levels of tisotumab vedotin (HuMax-TF-ADC) in 28 day treatment cycles.

The Cohort Expansion portion of the trial will further explore the recommended phase 2 dose of tisotumab vedotin (HuMax-TF-ADC) as determined in Part 1.
