Dasatinib for Patients Achieving Complete Molecular Response for Cure D-NewS Trial
The purpose of this study is to assess whether dasatinib can be discontinued without occurrence of molecular relapse in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase in complete molecular remission(CMR) while on dasatinib.
Myelogenous Leukemia, Chronic, Chronic Phase
