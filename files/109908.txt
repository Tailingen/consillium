BI-1607 in Combination with Trastuzumab in Subjects with HER2-positive Advanced Solid Tumors
HER2+ breast and gastric cancer patients' survival is significantly improved by trastuzumab alone or in combination with chemotherapy. However, many patients remain uncured and develop resistance to trastuzumab resulting in relapse or progression of the disease. BI-1607, a human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody (mAb) targets CD32b (Fc Gamma Receptor IIB), it is intended to enhance the efficacy and overcome resistance to existing cancer treatments such as trastuzumab.

This is a Phase 1/2a, first-in-human, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation, consecutive-cohort study of BI-1607 in combination with trastuzumab in subjects with HER2+ advanced solid tumors whose tumor has progressed after standard therapy.

This is a Phase 1/2a, first-in-human, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation, consecutive-cohort study of BI-1607 in combination with trastuzumab in subjects with HER2+ advanced solid tumors whose tumor has progressed after standard therapy.

The Phase 1 part of the trial is a dose escalation study of BI-1607 combined with trastuzumab in HER2+ advanced or metastatic solid tumors, the aim is to assess safety and tolerability and to determine the recommended phase II dose of BI-1607 in combination with trastuzumab.

The selected dose of BI-1607 will be studied in a subsequent Phase 2a part of the trial along with trastuzumab in 2 open-label, expansion cohorts of 15 evaluable subjects each. The first cohort will enroll subjects with locally advanced or metastatic HER2+ breast cancer, and the second will recruit subjects with HER2+ metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. The aim of the phase 2a is to collect additional safety data to further support the recommended dose, and to detect early signs of clinical activity.
