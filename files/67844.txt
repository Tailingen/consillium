Evaluation of Tumor Resection Guided by Intraoperative Indocyanine Green Dye Fluorescence Angiography in Patients With Sarcoma
This study evaluates the effectiveness of intraoperative indocyanine green dye and fluoroscopic technology in confirming negative margins after tumor removal.
Bone Sarcoma|Soft Tissue Sarcoma
OTHER: Non-Interventional Study
Accuracy of intraoperative ICG fluorescence compared to final pathology results, Intraoperative ICG fluorescence and deduced margins will be analyzed and compared the accuracy to final pathology margins. Negative predictive value will be calculated., Baseline
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To evaluate the use of indocyanine green (ICG) as an intraoperative guide during bone and soft tissue sarcoma resection.

OUTLINE: This is an observational study.

Patients receive ICG infusion prior to undergoing scheduled resection and have medical records reviewed on study.
