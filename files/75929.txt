Carfilzomib With Bendamustine and Rituximab in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
This study will be conducted as a Phase Ib, open-label, non-randomized, single-institution study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of carfilzomib in combination with bendamustine and rituximab in patients with relapsed or refractory NHL and to determine the recommended phase II dose and preliminary efficacy of this combination. The study will have two phases: a dose-escalation phase to determine the maximal tolerated dose of carfilzomib in this combination where participants will be monitored for toxicity, tolerability and response and a dose-expansion phase that will determine the preliminary efficacy in patients with Mantle cell lymphoma or any other disease subtype in which there is a preliminary efficacy signal observed.
Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin|Lymphoma
DRUG: Carfilzomib|DRUG: Bendamustine|DRUG: Rituximab
Maximally tolerated dose (MTD), The MTD will be the dose level immediately preceding the dose level at which \>= 2 Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT) are observed and at which 0/3 or 1/6 participants experiences a DLT., Up to 1 cycle (28 days per cycle)|Number of participants with Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT), The DLT period will correspond to cycle 1 of therapy. The National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.0 will be used to assess the severity of adverse events. The causality of each AE will be assessed by the investigator for confirmation of a DLT., Up to 1 cycle (28 days per cycle)
Overall Response Rate (ORR), The lymphoma response assessment will be determined using the revised International Working Group (IWG) criteria for Complete Response (CR) defined as complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and disease-related symptoms if present before therapy, a post-treatment residual mass of any size is permitted as long as it is Positron Emission Tomography (PET) negative, the spleen and/or liver, if enlarged before therapy on the basis of the physical examination or CT scan, should not be palpable on physical examination and should be considered normal size by imaging studies, and nodules related to lymphoma should disappear, etc. or Partial Response (PR) defined as the post-treatment PET should be positive in at least one previously involved site, At least a 50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to six of the largest dominant nodes or nodal masses, No new sites of disease should be observed, etc., Up to 2 years|Median Duration of Response, Defined as the time from documentation of PR or CR until documented lymphoma progression or receipt of anti-lymphoma therapy or death due to lymphoma. Patients are to be censored at the time of last follow-up or death due to another cause., Up to 2 years|Median Progression Free Survival (PFS), Defined as the time from day 1 until lymphoma progression, receipt of anti-lymphoma therapy, or death as a result of any cause. Patients will be censored at the time of last follow up., Up to 2 years|Median Time to Next Therapy, Time to next therapy is measured from day 1 to receipt of anti-lymphoma therapy or death due to lymphoma. Patients are censored at the time of last follow-up or death unrelated to treatment or disease., Up to 2 years
Median Overall Survival, Defined as the time from day 1 until death as a result of any cause. Patients will be censored at the time of last follow-up, Up to 2 years|Correlation of antitumor activity with markers of activation of the terminal unfolded protein response (UPR) or modulation of the apoptotic pathway in primary tumor tissue., The molecular events associated with the terminal UPR and apoptotic pathways will be correlated to assess their predictive utility for response to therapy with carfilzomib in combination with bendamustine., Up to 2 years|Correlation of treatment-related toxicity with markers of activation of the terminal unfolded protein response (UPR) or modulation of the apoptotic pathway in primary tumor tissue., The molecular events associated with the terminal UPR and apoptotic pathways will be correlated to assess their predictive utility for response to toxicity with carfilzomib in combination with bendamustine., Up to 2 years
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To assess the safety and tolerability of carfilzomib when combined with bendamustine (bendamustine hydrochloride) and rituximab in patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate the preliminary antitumor activity of carfilzomib with bendamustine and rituximab in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (dose escalation) and with specific non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) subtypes (dose expansion).

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of carfilzomib.

Patients receive carfilzomib intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes twice weekly on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 or weekly on days 2, 9, and 16; bendamustine hydrochloride IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 2; and rituximab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 9 (course 1 only) and day 1 (subsequent courses). Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 weeks for 6 months, every 3 months for 6 months, and then every 6 months thereafter.
