All patients had their baseline viral indicators for HBV and HCV evaluated. Additionally, blood samples were taken for genotyping. All patients underwent evaluations of their kidney, liver, and alpha fetoprotein (AFP) functions, as well as their complete blood count (CBC), at both the baseline and follow-up appointments. To evaluate the efficacy of TACE, triple pelvic abdominal CT scans were performed both prior to and one month later. Using triphasic pelviabdominal CT, patients who achieved complete response (CR) were monitored for up to 13 months following chemotherapy in order to identify recurrence. Follow-up appointments were planned to identify patients responces or any negative effects.
