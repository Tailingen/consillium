Risk-adapted Donor Lymphocyte Infusion After Allo-HSCT in Children With Hematologic Malignancy
Allo-hsct is potentially curative method of treatment for children and adolescent with hematologic malignancy. However, relapses of disease after allo-hsct occur up to 50% of patients and constitute the main cause of mortality after HSCT. Donor lymphocytes infusion (DLI) is a form of immunotherapy based on developement of reaction "graft versus from leukemia". This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of risk-adapted srtategy of DLI for prophylaxis and prevention posttransplant relapses in children and adolescent with hematologic malignancy.
