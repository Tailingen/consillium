Impact of Magnetic Resonance and Biomarkers for Screening for Prostate Cancer. Cost-effectiveness Analysis
Objectives: To establish if there are differences between an ultrasound-guided transrectal prostate biopsy (BPTE) and a transperineal prostatic biopsy (BPTP) with and without a multiparametric Magnetic Resonance (RMmp) in patients with clinical suspicion of prostate cancer (PC) to first prostatic biopsy in terms of:

1. Rate of detection and diagnosis of prostate cancer.
2. Aggressiveness of the detected tumors.
3. Association of the marker \[-2\] proPSA and the prostate cancer health index (PHI) and microRNAs for the diagnosis of tumors.
4. Adverse effects of the intervention and subjective perception of the patient: pain and degree of satisfaction, and impairment of quality of life.
5. Cost-effectiveness analysis of the different intervention options.

Study Design: Randomized, single-blind prospective clinical study to compare four schemes: RMmp + BPTE vs. BPTE 12 cylinders vs RMmp + BPTP vs BPTP 12 cylinders.

Study population: Patients with clinical suspicion of prostate cancer with PSA between 3-20 ng / mL and normal or abnormal rectal examination, candidates for a first prostate biopsy.

Research techniques: BPTE standard of 12 cylinders compared to RMmp previous to BPTE vs BPTP of 12 cylinders compared to BPTP with previous RMmp.
Establish the Efficacy Between the Four Schemes in Terms of the Aggressiveness of the Tumors According to the Gleason Classification|Establish the Efficacy Between the Four Schemes in Terms of Morbidity Associated With the Technique|Establish the Efficacy Between the Four Schemes in Terms of the Patient's Subjective Perception Regarding Pain and Quality of Life|Establish the Association of the Tumor Biomarker in the Early Detection and Aggressiveness of Tumors|Establish the Possible Interaction Between Biomarkers and Resonance in Different Prostate Biopsy Models to Define Tumor Presence and / or Tumor Aggressiveness|Establish the Possible Relationship Between the Expression Profiles of the microRNAs|Establish if There Are Differences Between Transrectal and Transperineal Prostatic Biopsy Schemes in Both Cases With and Without MRI
PROCEDURE: Multiparametric magnetic resonance
Comparation between transrectal and transperineal prostatic biopsy with o without Magnetic Resonance, Establish if there are differences between the transrectal and transperineal prostatic biopsy schemes in both cases with and without MRI, in patients with suspected clinical risk of prostate cancer (total PSA between 3 and 20 ng / mL, free PSA index / Total PSA less than 20% and normal or abnormal rectal examination) in terms of efficacy measured by the detection rate and tumor aggressiveness of the tumors detected, complication rates and cost analysis., 6 months
