Homologous Recombination Repair Pathway Gene Mutation Spectrum in Chinese Breast Cancer Patients
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn about the mutation spectrum of homologous recombination repair pathway genes and its instructive significance in the treatment of Chinese breast cancer patients.
Breast Cancer
Homologous recombination repair pathway gene mutation spectrum, to reveal the homologous recombination repair pathway gene mutation spectrum, At recruitment
Breast cancer events, to compare the incidence of breast cancer-related events and deaths between patients with or without homologous recombination repair pathway gene mutation(s), At 5 years from surgery|Treatment decision and appliance, to compare the treatment decision and appliance between patients with or without homologous recombination repair pathway gene mutation(s), At 5 years from surgery
The main questions it aims to answer are:

1. What is the mutation spectrum of homologous recombination repair pathway genes in Chinese breast cancer patients?
2. Does homologous recombination repair pathway gene mutation have an impact on patient outcome (breast cancer recurrence, neoadjuvant chemotherapy efficacy, treatment decisions, etc.) ? There is no intervention on participants, but all participants will be given regular follow-up post surgery according to ASCO guidelines.
