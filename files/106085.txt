Efficacy and Safety of Gadobutrol 1.0 Molar (Gadovist) for Breast MRI
The purpose of this study is to look at the efficacy (how does it work) and safety of gadobutrol when used for obtaining MR images of both breasts.Women with a recent diagnosis of breast cancer by mammogram (X-ray examination of the breasts) may benefit from MRI of the breasts as MRI may detect additional breast cancers.

Difference for Sensitivity for Detection of Full Extent of Malignant Breast Disease Using CMRM vs UMRM Per Reader, For a single participant the sensitivity was defined as the proportion of malignant breast regions that were recognized by the clinical investigators and the 3 blinded readers using the respective imaging modality as malignant. Subsequently the sensitivity percentage was calculated based on the mean of the sensitivities across all participants. The difference was calculated as CMRM value minus UMRM value. For ease of expression, the following abbreviations will be used: Magnetic Resonance Mammography (MRM), Unenhanced MRM (UMRM), combined unenhanced and contrast (gadobutrol)-enhanced MRM (CMRM), X-ray mammography (XRM)., Immediately before injection and after injection|Sensitivity for Detection of Full Extent of Malignant Breast Disease Using CMRM vs UMRM Per Reader, For a single participant the sensitivity was defined as the proportion of malignant breast regions that were recognized by the clinical investigators and the 3 blinded readers using the respective imaging modality as malignant. Subsequently the sensitivity percentage was calculated based on the mean of the sensitivities across all participants., Immediately before injection and after injection|Breast Level Specificity of CMRM for Non-malignant Breasts by Reader, A non-malignant breast was defined as false positive (FP), when the reader assessed at least one breast region as malignant. When all breast regions were assessed as non-malignant, the breast was defined as true negative (TN). Breast level specificity was first defined in participant as number of TN-breasts in participant divided by number of non-malignant breasts in participant. Subsequently the specificity percentage was calculated based on the mean of the specificities across all participants who contributed with at least one non-malignant breast., Immediately before injection and after injection
