Progression-free Survival (PFS) Based on Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) in the Hormone Receptor-Positive Cohort in Participants With HER2-low Breast Cancer, Progression-free survival (PFS), defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, was assessed from the date of randomization to the date of the first radiographic disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever came first. PFS was based on blinded independent central review (BICR) in the hormone receptor-positive cohort according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST) version 1.1. Median PFS was from Kaplan-Meier analysis. Confidence interval for median was computed using the Brookmeyer-Crowley method., From the date of randomization to the earliest date of the first objective documentation of radiographic disease progression or death due to any cause, up to approximately 3 years

If there was no death reported for a participant before the data cutoff for OS analysis, OS was censored at the last contact date at which the participant was known to be alive., From the date of randomization up to the date of death due to any cause, up to approximately 3 years|Number of Overall Survival Events (Deaths), From the date of randomization up to the date of death due to any cause, up to approximately 3 years|Overall Survival (OS) in All Patients, Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause. If there was no death reported for a participant before the data cutoff for OS analysis, OS was censored at the last contact date at which the participant was known to be alive., From the date of randomization up to the date of death due to any cause, up to approximately 3 years|Best Overall Response and Confirmed Objective Response Rate (ORR) in the Hormone Receptor-Positive Cohort in Participants With HER2-low Breast Cancer, Best overall response rate and confirmed objective response rate (ORR) were assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) and investigator assessment. Complete response (CR) was defined as a disappearance of all target lesions, partial response (PR) was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, and stable disease (SD) was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD; at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. Confirmed ORR was defined as the number of participants with complete and partial responses and confirmed by a second assessment., From screening and every 6 weeks up to withdrawal of subject consent, progressive disease (PD), or unacceptable toxicity, up to approximately 3 years|Best Overall Response and Confirmed Objective Response Rate (ORR) in Participants With HER2-low Breast Cancer (All Patients), Best overall response rate and confirmed objective response rate (ORR) were assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) and investigator assessment.

DoR was based on blinded independent central review (BICR) and investigator assessment. Median was from Kaplan-Meier estimate. Confidence interval for median was computed using the Brookmeyer-Crowley method., From the date of the first documented objective response (CR or PR) to the first documented disease progression or death, whichever occurs first, up to approximately 3 years|Duration of Response in Participants With HER2-low Breast Cancer (All Patients), Duration of Response (DoR) is defined as the date of the first documented objective response (complete response \[CR\] or partial response \[PR\]) to the first documented disease progression or death, whichever occurs first.

All-Cause Mortality, All-cause mortality is defined as all anticipated and unanticipated deaths due to any cause, with the number and frequency of such events by arm or comparison group of the clinical study., From the date of randomization up to the date of death due to any cause, up to approximately 3 years
This is a randomized, 2-arm, Phase 3, open-label, multicenter study to compare the safety and efficacy of trastuzumab deruxtecan versus the physician's choice (2:1) in HER2-low, unresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer participants.

The Sponsor proposes to define a new HER2-low population in this trial including tumors with IHC 1+ and IHC 2+/ISH- HER2 expression.
