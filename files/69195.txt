A randomized multi-component physical activity intervention for breast cancer survivors.
Physical Activity|Breast Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Physical activity education|BEHAVIORAL: Facility access|BEHAVIORAL: Supervised exercise sessions|BEHAVIORAL: Self-monitoring (Fitbit)|BEHAVIORAL: Active living counseling
Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity measured by Actigraph accelerometer, Measure physical activity at baseline and follow-up periods (3- and 6-months post-baseline) and assess percentage of survivors meeting physical activity guideline recommendations., 24 weeks
The research project is a study to assess the effects of a multi-component intervention in increasing physical activity among breast cancer survivors. Individuals meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized to one of sixteen intervention groups for the 6 months. Intervention components will include print-based education, self-monitoring, Active Living counseling, supervised exercise sessions, and facility access. Blood samples will be collected at baseline. Assessments (anxiety, stress, sleep) and sample collection will also occur at 3 time points during the intervention (Weeks 13 and 25). Changes in physical activity will be assessed for each intervention group.
