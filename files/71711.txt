Pilot Study of NKG2D-Ligand Targeted CAR-NK Cells in Patients With Metastatic Solid Tumours
This is a single-centre, single arm, open-label pilot study to evaluate the safety and feasibility of CAR-NK cell treatment in subjects with metastatic solid tumours. Autologous or allogeneic NK cells are transfected by mRNA electroporation to prepare investigational CAR-NK cells with transiently enhanced specificity and activity against NKG2D-ligand expressing cancer cells.
Solid Tumours
BIOLOGICAL: CAR-NK cells targeting NKG2D ligands
Number of Adverse Events, from day 0 - month 4
Anti-tumour response due to CAR-NK cell infusions, 100 days after CAR-NK cell infusion
