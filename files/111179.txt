A Study of Ultrasonography With Elastography in Skin Neoplasms
This study will look at high frequency ultrasound as a medical imaging modality and apply it to skin lesions. Elastography is an ultrasonic method of looking at the hardness of an area. We will use this to try and differentiate between benign and cancerous skin lesions.
