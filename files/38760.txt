Adaptive Dose-Escalated Multi-modality Image-guided RadiothErapy
Patients with primary head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) planned for treatment with radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy in curative setting will be treated with an adaptive radiotherapy scheme. An FDG-PET/CT scan for re-delineation and re-planning will be made at the end of the second and fourth of week of radiotherapy. The non-responding part of the tumor on FDG-PET will receive a mild dose-escalation. Depending on the metabolic response, the entire tumor will receive 70 Gy or the residual FDG-avid area will receive 74 or 78 Gy.

the feasibility of the adaptive radiotherapy scheme estimated by the acute toxicities and implementation of the adaptive treatment plans, The feasibility of the adaptive radiotherapy schedule will be rejected in case of:

Occurrence of intolerable radiation-induced acute toxicities., 1 year|the feasibility of the adaptive radiotherapy scheme estimated by the implementation of the adaptive treatment plans, The feasibility of the adaptive radiotherapy schedule will be rejected in case of:

The inability to implement 80% of the adaptive treatment plans within 2 days from the intended starting day, 1 year
the toxicity of the adaptive RT scheme, according to the CTCAE v4.0 scoring system, 1 year|the locoregional tumor control, 1 year|relative response will be calculated for the decrease of the SUV-value, the prognostic value of the FDG-PET/CT-scans, 1 year
If there is a complete metabolic response on the FDG-PET after 2 weeks, the entire tumor will receive 70 Gy. If there is a complete metabolic response after 4 weeks of treatment, the residual FDG-avid area will receive 74 Gy. If there also is no complete metabolic response after 4 weeks of treatment, the residual FDG-avid area will receive 78 Gy.
