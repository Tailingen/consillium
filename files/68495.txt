Exercise Program in Breast Cancer Patients Receiving Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
The investigators seek to conduct a home based exercise intervention in breast cancer patients whom elect to undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The primary aim of the study is to determine whether breast cancer patients can be enrolled, randomized, retained, and comply with exercise program; and, the feasibility of acquiring, managing and analyzing clinical data.

BEHAVIORAL: Exercise
Acceptability: Percent of Eligible Patients That Provide Consent and Are Enrolled in the Study., Acceptability of the study will be assessed by documenting the percent of eligible patients that provide consent and are enrolled in the study., 4 weeks|Participant Adherence to the Exercise Intervention, Tolerability was defined for each intervention exercise training phase by the percent of weekly exercise minutes completed at the prescribed exercise intensity according to the patient's heart rate monitor., Introduction phase of prescribed exercise training (weeks 1-4), intermediate phase of prescribed exercise training (weeks 5-11), maintenance phase of prescribed exercise training (weeks 12-chemotherapy completion)|Change in Cardiopulmonary Fitness Level From Baseline to the Window Following Chemotherapy Completion and Before Surgical Resection, Expired gas analysis (oxygen used by the body) during a submaximal treadmill exercise test determined cardiopulmonary fitness. Change between baseline and the window following chemotherapy completion and before surgical resection, was calculated as the value at the test conducted in the window following chemotherapy completion and before surgical resection minus the value at the test conducted at baseline., Baseline and the window following chemotherapy completion and before surgical resection (no longer than 26 weeks from baseline)
Several national and international agencies recommend exercise participation for all persons following a cancer diagnosis. The current evidence suggests that aerobic exercise training is safe during primary adjuvant therapy and improves cardiopulmonary function and patient related outcomes. Cardiopulmonary fitness is highly predictive of overall and cardiovascular specific mortality in women. Specifically, an increase in cardiopulmonary fitness of approximately 10% has been associated with a 19% reduction in risk for CV mortality. This is important as breast cancer patients already present at diagnosis with 31% lower cardiopulmonary fitness levels compared to healthy age-matched women. This enhanced risk for cardiovascular mortality in breast cancer patients is further compounded by cardiotoxic chemotherapy, which causes permanent cardiac damage. Few studies have tested the efficacy of exercise prescriptions that incorporate high intensity aerobic exercise training in cancer patients, especially those receiving chemotherapy. Therefore, the investigators seek to conduct an at home aerobic exercise training intervention in breast cancer patients whom elect to undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy
