The Efficacy and Safety of Fluzopril Combined With Apatinib in Maintenance Treatment of Platinum Resistant Recurrent Ovarian Cancer Patients
Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecological malignancy, posing a serious threat to women's health worldwide.Platinum resistant ovarian cancer is the biggest challenge faced by gynecological oncologists.Exploring more effective treatment options and how to delay the recurrence of platinum resistant recurrent ovarian cancer remains a challenging issue in clinical treatment.The main goal of this trial is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of fluzopril combined with apatinib in maintenance treatment of platinum resistant recurrent ovarian cancer patients by evaluating progression free survival (PFS).Fifty patients with advanced ovarian cancer who underwent platinum resistant recurrent chemotherapy and assessed no disease progression were enrolled in the study, and maintenance treatment was performed with fluzopril combined with apatinib.
