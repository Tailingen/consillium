Savolitinib Plus Docetaxel as 2L in EGFR/ALK/ROS1/MET ex14m-wildtype NSCLC With MET Overexpression
This is a prospective, pilot, single-arm, single-center study exploring the efficacy and safety of savolitinib plus docetaxel as second-line therapy in patients with MET overexpressed, EGFR/ALK/ROS1/MET ex14m-wildtype advanced NSCLC.

Participants will receive treatment of docetaxel (60 mg/m2, ivgtt, q3w) in combination with savolitinib (300mg or 200mg according to safety run-in recommendation, p.o., BID) after informed consent signed. Treatment will continue until either objective disease progression, unacceptable toxicity occurs, consent is withdrawn, other discontinuation criterion is met, or study completion.

ORR (Objective Response Rate), ORR (Objective Response Rate) is defined as the proportion of participants who confirmed CR (Complete Response) or PR (Partial response) as their best overall response based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)1.1 as assessed by the investigator., The analysis will occur at 12 weeks after last patient in.
PFS (Progression-Free Survival), PFS (Progression-Free Survival) is defined as the time from the first dose of study intervention until the date of objective disease progression or death (by any cause in the absence of progression) regardless of whether the patient withdraws from therapy or receives another anti-cancer therapy prior to progression., The analysis will occur when 70% data maturity of PFS events (14 PFS events) is observed in each cohort, at approximately 9 months after last patient in.|DoR (Duration of Response), DoR (Duration of Response) is defined as the time from the date of first documented response until date of documented progression or death in the absence of disease progression (ie, date of PFS (Progression-Free Survival) event or censoring-date of first response+1)., The analysis will occur when 70% data maturity of PFS events (14 PFS events) is observed in each cohort, at approximately 9 months after last patient in.|DCR (Disease Control Rate), DCR (Disease Control Rate) is defined as the number(percent)of subjects with at least one visit response of confirmed CR (Complete Response), PR (Partial Response) or SD (Stable Disease), based on Investigator assessment according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1., The analysis will occur at 12 weeks after last patient in.|OS (Overall Survival), OS (Overall Survival) is defined as the time from the start of treatment until death due to any cause. Any patient not known to have died at the time of analysis will be censored based on the last recorded date on which the patient was known to be alive., The analysis will occur when 70% data maturity of PFS events (14 PFS events) is observed in each cohort, at approximately 9 months after last subject in, up to a maximum of approximately 3 years after first subject in.
