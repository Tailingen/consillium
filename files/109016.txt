Study of ADCs Combined With Adebrelimab in HER2-negative Advanced Breast Cancer
Our study is aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of novel ADCs named SHR-A1811 and SHR-A1921 combined with adebrelimab in HER2-negative advanced breast cancer.
Advanced Breast Cancer
DRUG: SHR-A1811|DRUG: SHR-A1921|DRUG: Adebrelimab
ORR (objective response rate) by investigator, ORR is the percentage of evaluable patients with a confirmed investigator-assessed response of CR (complete response) or PR (partial response) per RECIST v1.1., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 3.5 years
DCR (disease control rate) by investigator, DCR is the percentage of evaluable patients with a confirmed investigator-assessed response of CR (complete response), PR (partial response) or SD (stable disease) per RECIST v1.1., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 3.5 years|CBR (clinical benefit rate) by investigator, CBR is the percentage of evaluable patients with a confirmed investigator-assessed response of CR (complete response), PR (partial response) or SD lastingâ‰¥24 weeks (stable disease) per RECIST v1.1., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 3.5 years|DoR (duration of response), DoR is the time from the date of first detection of objective response (which is subsequently confirmed) until the date of objective radiographic disease progression., up to 3.5 years|PFS (progression-free survival), PFS is the time from the date of first dose until the date of objective radiographic disease progression or death (by any cause in the absence of progression)., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 3.5 years|OS (overall survival), OS is the time from the date of first dose until the date of death by any cause., up to 3.5 years|Safety as assessed by percentage of patients with any Adverse Event (AE), An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, disease, or worsening of preexisting condition temporally associated with study treatment and irrespective of causality to study treatment. Percentage of participants who experienced an adverse event and discontinued study drug due to an AE., up to 3.5 years
