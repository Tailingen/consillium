Anti-FLT3 CAR T-cell Therapy in FLT3 Positive Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This is a prospective,open-label, phase1/2 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of anti-FLT3 chimeric antigen receptor engineered T cell immunotherapy (CART) in the treatment of FLT3 positive relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: anti-FLT3 CAR-T
Number of Adverse Events, Adverse events are evaluated with CTCAE V5.0, 12 months
Overall response rate (ORR), ORR includes CR, CRi, MLFS and PR. Complete remission (CR)：Bone marrow blasts \<5%; absence of circulating blasts and blasts with Auer rods; absence of extramedullary disease; absolute neutrophil count \>1.0x 10\^9/L; platelet count \>100x10\^9/L. CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi)：All CR criteria except for residual neutropenia (\<1.0 x 109/L) or thrombocytopenia (\<100 x 109/L). Morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS): Bone marrow blasts \<5%; absence of blasts with Auer rods; absence of extramedullary disease; no hematologic recovery required. Partial remission (PR): All hematologic criteria of CR; decrease of bone marrow blast percentage to 5% to 25%; and decrease of pretreatment bone marrow blast percentage by at least 50%., 2 years|Event-free survival (EFS), time from enrollment to the date of primary refractory disease, or relapse from CR or CRi, or death from any cause, 2 years|Cumulative incidence of relapse(CIR), time from the date of achievement of a remission until the date of relapse, 2 years
The patients will receive infusion of anti-FLT3 CAR T-cells targeting FLT3 to evaluate the safety and efficacy of anti-FLT3 CAR T-Cells in relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia.
