Spaced Education to Optimize Prostate Cancer Screening
Two memory research findings (the spacing and testing effects) can dramatically improve retention of learning, but they have largely have been ignored by educators. The researchers have developed a novel form of online education (termed 'spaced education') based on these two effects which has been shown in randomized trials to improve knowledge acquisition and boost learning retention. Using prostate cancer screening as an experimental system, the researchers investigated whether spaced education could durably improve clinicians' behaviors, not just their knowledge.
Prostate Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Online spaced education
Percentage of inappropriate prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening performed by clinicians, The primary outcome measure was the difference in the percentage of inappropriate PSA screening performed by clinicians in the spaced education and control cohorts. Based on published clinical guidelines and reports, inappropriate PSA utilization was defined as the use of PSA for prostate cancer screening in patients \>76 or \<40 years old, or with an estimated life expectancy of less than 10 years., Weeks 1-108
Change in test scores between cohorts measured in weeks 1-36, Weeks 1-36|Change in spaced education performance measured in weeks 1-36, Weeks 1-36|Clinicians' intention to participate in future spaced education programs, Assessed on end-of program survey at week 36, Week 36|Time required by clinicians to complete the spaced education questions-explanations, Assessed on end-of program survey at week 36, Week 36
