Randomized Trial of Avelumab-cetuximab-radiotherapy Versus SOCs in LA SCCHN (REACH)
The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that treatment with avelumab in combination with RT-cetuximab is superior to standard of care (SOC) cisplatin-RT and/or to SOC RT-cetuximab alone in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) in front-line patients with locally advanced SCCHN.
HNSCC
DRUG: Cetuximab|DRUG: avelumab|DRUG: Cisplatin|RADIATION: IMRT
Progression free survival, Time between randomization and the first event among progression (per modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version v1.1) and death, whatever the cause of death., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 74 months
Overall survival, From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 74 months|Safety: acute adverse events graded by NCI CTCAE v4.03, From date of randomization to end of study, assessed up to 74 months
This open-label, randomized, controlled, multicenter phase III study will include 688 patients with LA SCCHN (420 fit for HD cisplatin and 268 unfit for HD cisplatin), histologically confirmed who had not received previous treatment for this setting. The study is designed with the primary objective of demonstrating that treatment with avelumab in combination with cetuximab-RT is superior to SOC Cisplatin-RT or cetuximab-RT alone in terms of PFS. Randomization will assign the 2 treatment arms of each cohort with a 1:1 ratio. In each cohort (fit for cisplatin and unfit for cisplatin), the randomization will be stratified for the 2 most established prognostic factors N stage (N0-N1 vs N2-3) and p16 expression (OPC p16+ versus OPC p16- or non OPC). All patients will be followed until death or at least 60 months.
