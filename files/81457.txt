A Study of CNTY-101 in Participants With CD19-Positive B-Cell Malignancies
ELiPSE-1 is a Phase 1, multi-center, dose-finding study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of CNTY-101 in participants with relapsed or refractory cluster of differentiation (CD)19-positive B-cell malignancies.
