Interactive Survivorship Program for the Improvement of Healthcare Resources in Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer Survivors, INSPIRE-AYA Study
This trial studies how well an interactive survivorship program works in improving healthcare resources in adolescent and young adult cancer survivors. By improving access to survivorship resources, health literacy, self-management skills, and support, an interactive survivorship program may help to improve adherence to adolescent and young adult healthcare guidelines and reduce cancer-related distress.

Change in distress score from baseline to 3 months, Will be assessed by Cancer and Treatment Distress (CTXD). The CTXD is a 22 item Likert type scale that contains 6 subscales: uncertainty, health burden, identity, medical demands, finances, and family strain. Scores on individual items range from 0 (none) to 3 (severe) distress related to an aspect of the cancer experience. Patients will meet the primary endpoint for lack of distress if they score \< 0.9 on the CTXD., From baseline to 3 months|Change in distress score from baseline to 12 months, Will be assessed by Cancer and Treatment Distress (CTXD).

Proportion of healthcare adherence (HCA)-all, Patients will meet HCA endpoint if their percent of recommended screenings obtained within the past 12 months is \>= 80% for HCA-all., At 12 months|Proportion of HCA-cardiometabolic surveillance (CM), Patients will meet each HCA endpoint if their percent of recommended screenings obtained within the past 12 months is \>= 80% for HCA-CM., At 12 months|Proportion of HCA-cancer surveillance (SM), Patients will meet each HCA endpoint if their percent of recommended screenings obtained within the past 12 months is \>= 80% for HCA-SM., At 12 months
OUTLINE: Patients who have one or more elevated distress or low cardiometabolic or cancer health care adherence are randomized to Arm I or II.

ARM I (INTERVENTION): Patients receive a personalized Survivorship Care Plan (SCP) and use the Interactive Survivorship Program to Improve Healthcare Resources (INSPIRE) mobile application. Patients may receive telehealth stepped care after 1 month.

ARM II (CONTROL): Patients receive access to a study-specific control website that has annotated links to existing resources for adolescent and young adult (AYA) survivors. After 12 months, patients receive a personalized SCP and have access to the digital INSPIRE intervention program without telehealth calls.
