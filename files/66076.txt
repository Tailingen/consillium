First in Human Study for the Assessment of Safety and Initial Performance of the EAS1 System
A Prospective, open label, multi center, single arm, First in Human study to assess the safety and initial performance of EAS1 system for Irreversible Electroporation (IRE) ablation of lung cancer in subjects eligible for tumor resection
Lung Cancer
DEVICE: EAS1 System
Safety of the EAS1 System in Lung Tumor Ablation During Procedure, Accumulative rate of device related Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) during the ablation and up to 48 hours post ablation, 48 hours post procedure
Safety of the EAS1 System in Lung Tumor Ablation Throughout Follow Up, Rate of device related SAEs during the follow up period, 30 days|Investigator's Ability to Approach and Ablate the Tumor (Technical Success), - Technical success, defined as the investigator's ability to access the target tumor and successfully perform the irreversible electroporation, as confirmed by histology analysis, 30 days
Investigator's Impression of the Treatment (Investigator's Satisfaction), Investigator satisfaction, as determined by completing an internal ease-of-use questionnaire following each procedure. The questionnaire consists of 10 questions, each ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much). Range of total score is 10-50, where the higher the total score, the more satisfied the investigator is from device use, 30 days|Assessment of Immunological Response Following Ablation, Immunological response, as determined by change from baseline to 30 day FU in immunological blood markers., 30 days
A Prospective, open label, multi center, single arm, First in Human study to assess the safety and initial performance of EAS1 system for Irreversible Electroporation (IRE) ablation of lung cancer in subjects eligible for tumor resection
