JAB-BX102 Monotherapy and Combination With Pembrolizumab in Adult Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of JAB-BX102 monotherapy and combination therapy with pembrolizumab in adult participants with advanced solid tumors.
Solid Tumor
BIOLOGICAL: JAB-BX102 (anti-CD73 monoclonal antibody)|BIOLOGICAL: pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody)
Dose Escalation phase Number of participants with dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), A DLT is defined as the clinically significant TRAE(treatment-related adverse events) or abnormal laboratory values assessment during the first 21 days of Cycle 1 and excludes events that are deemed clearly related to underlying disease, progression, or intercurrent illness., First 21 days of Cycle 1|Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion phase: Number of participants with adverse events, Patients will be assessed for incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) according to NCI-CTCAE 5.0., Up to 3 years|Dose Expansion phase: Overall response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST v 1.1., Up to 3 years - from baseline to RECIST confirmed Progressive Disease|Expansion phase: Duration of response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the participant's initial objective response (CR or PR) to disease progression per CTCAE v1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 3 years
To characterize the pharmacokinetics(PK) profile of JAB-BX102 as a single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab, observed plasma concentration of JAB-BX102, Up to 3 years|Dose Escalation phase: Overall response rate (ORR), The percentage of participants with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) on RECIST v 1.1., Up to 3 years - from baseline to RECIST confirmed Progressive Disease|Dose Escalation phase: Duration of response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the participant's initial objective response (CR or PR) to disease progression per CTCAE v1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 3 years|Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion phase: Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as percentage of participants with complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) per CTCAE v1.1., Up to 3 years|Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion phase: Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the interval of time between the date of first treatment to the earliest date of disease progression per CTCAE v1.1 or death which occurs first, Up to 3 years
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of JAB-BX102 monotherapy to determine the MTD(maximum tolerated dose) and RP2D(Recommended Phase 2 Dose) during Dose Escalation phase; then to evaluate preliminary antitumor activity when JAB-BX102 is administered in combination with pembrolizumab during Dose Expansion phase in patients with advanced solid tumors.
