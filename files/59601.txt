Long-term Clinical Feasibility of the New Indwelling Provox Vega 20 Voice Prosthesis
The purpose of this study is to investigate long-term clinical feasibility of a new voice prosthesis and insertion system Provox Vega 20 with SmartInserter) for voice rehabilitation after total laryngectomy. Outcome measures are voice quality, ease of insertion, device life, and reason for replacement.
Total Laryngectomy
DEVICE: Provox Vega voice prosthesis (20 Fr)
Device Life Time, Device life was measured from the time of insertion until the time of replacement. Reason for replacement was recorded. Only replacements for leakage through the device are considered for calculation of device life time., at replacement of voice prosthesis (maximum 1 year)
Voice Quality, Subjective patient opinion about 5 voice related items (intelligibility face to face and on the phone, loudness, pitch and fluency). The best value is 5 and the worst value is 20., at 3 months or device change (whichever was first)|Ease of Insertion, The Vega voice prosthesis used in this study is inserted with a new insertion tool, the SmartInserter. Physicians were asked to rate the insertion on a 4 point scale. what they thought of the new insertion tool, also in comparison to the regular tool used in the clinic, the Provox2 inserter. As the Provox voice prosthesis is a tool physicians already used, no insertions were performed with the Provox2 inserter during the study., assessed immediately after insertion procedure|Reason for Replacement, At removal of prosthesis
The purpose of this study is to investigate long-term clinical feasibility of a new voice prosthesis and insertion system Provox Vega 20 with SmartInserter) for voice rehabilitation after total laryngectomy. Outcome measures are voice quality, ease of insertion, device life, and reason for replacement.
