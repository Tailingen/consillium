Assessment of Robotic Versus Laparoscopic Gastrectomy for Gastric Cancer Patients With High Surgical Difficulty
While robotic gastrectomy (RG) is increasingly used in gastric cancer surgery, its potential advantages over laparoscopic gastrectomy (LG) in high surgical difficulty (HSD) cases remain debated.
Gastrectomy for Gastric Cancer|Robotic Surgical Procedures|Laparoscopic Surgical Procedures
Overall survival, Telephone follow-up, Within 3 years after surgery
recurrence, Telephone follow-up, 36 months|Postoperative complications, Postoperative complications were evaluated according to the Clavien-Dindo classification and categorized as surgical or medical, 30 days after surgery
This retrospective cohort study included 3,534 patients with gastric cancer who underwent radical gastrectomy at eight high-volume hospitals. ITC was defined by any of the following criteria: operative time exceeding the third quartile, intraoperative estimated blood loss â‰¥ 400 mL, or conversion to open surgery. Propensity score matching (PSM) and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) were conducted to compare short- and long-term outcomes.
