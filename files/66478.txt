A Phase Ⅱ Study of Anlotinib Combined With Tislelizumab and AT in the Neoadjuvant Treatment of Triple-negative Breast Cancer
This is a prospective, single-arm and open-label phase II study, evaluating the efficacy and safety of anlotinib combined with tislelizumab and AT regimen as neoadjuvant treatment for triple-negative breast cancer. Participants will undergo/receive PDL1 testing after enrollment. All patients will be receive 6 cycles of low-dose anlotinib combined with tislelizumab and AT（Doxorubicin or Epirubicin+albumin-bound paclitaxel）regimen, followed by surgery.
Triple-negative Breast Cancer
DRUG: AT regimen|DRUG: Tislelizumab|DRUG: Anlotinib
Pathological complete response (pCR) rate using the definition of ypT0/Tis ypN0 (i.e., no invasive residual in breast or nodes; noninvasive breast residuals allowed) at the time of definitive surgery, pCR rate (ypT0/Tis ypN0) is defined as the percentage of participants without residual invasive cancer on hematoxylin and eosin evaluation of the complete resected breast specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes following completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy by current American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging criteria assessed by the local pathologist at the time of definitive surgery., up to approximately 21-24 weeks
Event-free Survival (EFS) as assessed by Investigator, EFS is defined as the time from randomization to any of the following events: progression of disease that precludes surgery, local or distant recurrence, second primary malignancy (breast or other cancers) or death due to any cause., Up to approximately 3 years|pCR rate using an alternative definition, ypT0 ypN0 (i.e., no invasive or noninvasive residual in breast or nodes) at the time of definitive surgery, pCR rate (ypT0 ypN0) is defined as the percentage of participants without residual invasive and in situ cancer on hematoxylin and eosin evaluation of the complete resected breast specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes following completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy by current AJCC staging criteria assessed by the local pathologist at the time of definitive surgery in all participants and in participants with tumors expressing Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1)., up to approximately 21-24 weeks|pCR rate using an alternative definition, ypT0/Tis (i.e., absence of invasive cancer in the breast irrespective of ductal carcinoma in situ or nodal involvement) at the time of definitive surgery, pCR rate (ypT0/Tis) is defined as the percentage of participants without invasive cancer in the breast irrespective of ductal carcinoma in situ or nodal involvement following completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy by current AJCC staging criteria assessed by the local pathologist at the time of definitive surgery in all participants and in participants with tumors expressing PD-L1., up to approximately 21-24 weeks|invasive disease-free survival(IDFS), The time from surgery to the first documented occurrence of an event defined as ipsilateral invasive local recurrence, ipsilateral locoregional invasive recurrence, distant recurrence, contralateral invasive breast cancer, or death from any cause, up to approximately 3 years|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. Participants without documented death at the time of the analysis will be censored at the date of the last follow-up., up to approximately 5 years|Percentage of participants who experience an adverse event (AE), An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered study treatment which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study treatment or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to study treatment or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of study treatment, is also an AE., up to approximately 60 weeks
