Immunotherapy Consolidation After Radical Treatment of Synchronous Oligo-metastatic NSCLC
This is a multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized phase II study to assess whether continuation of cemiplimab treatment (for up to 12 months) increases progression-free survival (PFS) as compared to placebo in patients with a stage IV, synchronous, oligometastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have not progressed following 4 cycles of cemiplimab with our without platinum-based chemotherapy and radical treatment.

Eligible patients are randomized with a 1:1 ratio to either the cemiplimab or placebo group and will undergo disease assessment (e.g. imaging, blood tests) at regular follow-up visits.
NSCLC Stage IV
DRUG: Cemiplimab|DRUG: Placebo
Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization until first occurrence of any of the following events:

* Disease progression at any site: loco-regional progression/recurrence (related to primary tumour); progression/recurrence of oligometastatic lesions initially present at registration
* Development of new metastatic lesions
* Death due to any cause.

Disease progression will be assessed using the RECIST 1.1 criteria., 9 years from first patient randomized
Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of randomization until date of death, for any reason, 6 years from first patient randomized|Time to disease progression, Time to disease progression is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first occurrence of any of the following events:

* Disease progression at any site: loco-regional progression/recurrence (related to primary tumour); progression/recurrence of oligometastatic lesions initially present at registration
* Development of new metastatic lesions
* Death due to progressive disease., 6 years from first patient randomized|Time to development of new metastatic lesions, Time to development of new metastatic lesions is the time interval from the date of randomization to the date of first occurrence of any of the following events:

* Development of new metastatic lesions not initially present at registration,
* Death due to progressive disease., 6 years from first patient randomized|Time to progression in oligometastatic lesions initially present at registration, Time to progression in oligometastatic lesions initially present at registration is the time interval from the date of randomization to the date of first progression/recurrence in at least one of the oligometastatic lesions initially present at registration, 6 years from first patient randomized|AEs according to NCI-CTCAE v5.0 and SAEs, This study will use the International Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0, for adverse event reporting, 9 years from first patient randomized|Patient reported QoL as measured by the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire, This questionnaire is composed of 30 individual questions that are scored into 15 multi-item and single-item scales according the EORTC scoring manual. These include five functional scales (physical, role, emotional, social, and cognitive), nine symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnoea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhoea and financial difficulties) and a global health status/QoL scale.

The functional and symptom questions follow the same structure using a 4-point Likert scale with responses from "not at all" to "very much".

The questions on global health an QoL use a 7-point Likert scale with responses from "very poor" to "excellent"., 9 weeks from last patient last treatment|Patient reported QoL as measured by the IL316 questionnaire - self assessment of treatment side effects, This questionnaire includes self-assessment of treatment side effects, most notable pneumonitis.

The questions follow the same structure using a 4-point Likert scale with responses from "not at all" to "very much" and are scored according to the scale structure of their respective source questionnaire., 9 weeks from last patient last treatment|Patient reported QoL as measured by the IL316 questionnaire - questions from EORTC QLQ-LC29 questionnaire, This questionnaire includes 8 questions from the EORTC lung cancer specific module (QLQ-LC29) were selected: the coughing domain scale (2 questions), the dyspnoea scale (3 questions), chest pain (1 question) and physical capabilities (1 question).

The questions follow the same structure using a 4-point Likert scale with responses from "not at all" to "very much" and are scored according to the scale structure of their respective source questionnaire., 9 weeks from last patient last treatment|Patient reported QoL as measured by the IL316 questionnaire - questions from EORTC QLQ-ELD14 questionnaire, This questionnaire includes 1 item from the validated QLQ-ELD14 questionnaire to include self-assessment on treatment burden: "How much has your treatment been a burden to you?" The questions follow the same structure using a 4-point Likert scale with responses from "not at all" to "very much" and are scored according to the scale structure of their respective source questionnaire., 9 weeks from last patient last treatment
Tumour molecular profile (NGS panel, WES (including germline), RNAseq), FFPE tumour tissue will be collected at diagnosis, at metastasectomy and at progression (if available).

NGS panel, WES (including germline), RNAseq will be used for analysis., 6 years from first patient randomized|ctDNA analysis, Blood will be collected at registration, at induction (C2D1), after induction, after radical therapy, at consolidation (every 9 weeks from C1D1 (5 times), at end of treatment and at PD., 6 years from first patient randomized|Circulating biomarkers such as cytokines, or auto-Ab, Blood will be collected at registration, at induction (C2D1), after induction, after radical therapy, at consolidation (every 9 weeks from C1D1 (5 times), at end of treatment and at PD., 6 years from first patient randomized|Biomarker assessment of the tumour microenvironment, FFPE tumour tissue and blood will be collected on regular time points during the study.

Analysis will be using multiplex Immuno-Fluorescence (mIF) or other imaging techniques, and/or spatial transcriptomics., 6 years from first patient randomized
