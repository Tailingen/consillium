A Clinical Study of Allogeneic CD19/BCMA CAR-T Cells for the Treatment of R/R B-cell Malignant Tumors
A single arm, open-label pilot study is designed to determine the safety and efficacy of CD19 and B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) targeted allogenic CAR-T cells (RN1101) in patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell or plasma cell-derived malignant tumors. 21 patients are planned to be enrolled in the dose-escalation trial. The primary objective of the study is to evaluation of the safety and feasibility of RN1101 for the treatment of relapsed/refractory B-cell or plasma cell-derived malignant tumors. The secondary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of RN1101 for the treatment of relapsed/refractory B-cell or plasma cell-derived malignant tumors. The exploratory objective is to evaluate expansion, persistence and ability of RN1101 to deplete CD19 or BCMA positive cells in patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell or plasma cell-derived malignant tumors.
