PEctin Rapid Fentanyl Efficacy Clinical Trial For pAin at Swallowing Undergoing radioTherapy
The primary objective of the present phase IIIb study is to assess the efficacy of FPNS compared with Physician Choice-Usual Care (PC-UC) in the reduction of swallowing predictable BTP in head and neck cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy.
Predictable BTP at Swallowing in in Head/Neck Cancer Patients Undergoing Radiotherapy Already Receiving Opioid Therapy for Background Pain
DRUG: Fentanyl pectin nasal spray (FPNS)|DRUG: Physician choice-Usual care (PC-UC)
Difference in the mean intensity of predictable BTP at swallowing from the baseline to 20 minutes after taking FPNS/PC-UC (PID20)., up to 6 (-1,+2) days
The difference in the mean intensity of predictable BTP at swallowing from the baseline to 10 and 30 minutes after taking FPNS/PC-UC., up to 6 (-1,+2) days|Time to reach the maximal pain reduction after administration of FPNS/PC-UC (evaluation of reduction in pain intensity score at each time point: 10,20,30 min after administration of FPNS or PC-UC), up to 6 (-1,+2) days|Patient's swallowing pain relief will be measured at the end of the study period through the 5-points numeric scale (0=none; 4=complete)., end of study|Clinically meaningful pain reduction will be analyzed by assessing percentages of episodes with ≥ 2 point reductions after drug treatment versus baseline and after FPNS versus PC-UC, up to 6 (-1,+2) days|Administration of rescue medication (dose and frequency), up to 6 (-1,+2) days|Patient's dysphagia assessment. An evaluation of dysphagia by MDADI questionnaire will be performed at baseline and at the end of the study period., day 1 and end of study|Safety and tolerability, up to 6 (-1,+2) days
Population: In and out patients with head and neck cancer undergoing radiotherapy, regardless of the day of the radiotherapy treatment, with or without chemotherapy and taking at least 60 mg of oral morphine daily or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid to control background pain (background pain controlled is defined as NRS \<4) but with uncontrolled pain at swallowing (moderate/severe intensity: ≥ 4 on a NRS 0-10).

Study design: Patients that have signed the ICF and met inclusion and exclusion criteria are randomly assigned 1:1 to receive one of the following predictable BTP at swallowing treatments:

1. Fentanyl pectin nasal spray (FPNS)
2. Physician choice-Usual Care (PC-UC) Each patient will take the drug no more than 3 episode a day (at main meals: breakfast, lunch and dinner) for 15 episodes in total in 6 (-1, +2) consecutive days. At each episode the patients will record the pain at baseline (before drug administration), and 10, 20 30 minutes after taking FPNS or PC-UC.

At each meal, if the administered dose of FPNS or PC-UC is not adequately effective on pain control, the patient is allowed to take a rescue medication of IRMS after 30 min from FPNS or PC-UC administration.
