BIBW 2992 (Afatinib) and Vinorelbine
This open-label, single-arm, multicentre phase II trial will be performed in patients with intermediate HER2-positive, metastatic breast cancer (MBC)pretreated with anthracyclines and one first-line therapy in the metastatic setting.

The main objective of the trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BIBW 2992 in combination with vinorelbine in patients with intermediate HER2-positive MBC. If this trial shows promising results, further studies to evaluate the benefit of BIBW 2992 in combination with chemotherapy in this subgroup of intermediate HER2-positive patients with MBC are warranted.

Patients will be followed until progression. After progression, for the purpose of analysing overall survival, information on vital status and subsequent treatment will be collected.

The primary objective is to determine the 6-month progression free survival rate of BIBW 2992 and vinorelbine i.v. in patients with metastatic, HER2 IHC 2+, HER2 FISH-negative breast cancer.

BIBW 2992 in combination with vinorelbine will provide a suitable combination to test the hypothesis that patients with metastatic breast cancer whose tumours are HER2 2+ by immunohistochemistry, but negative by fluorescence in-situ hybridisation (FISH) will benefit from a combination of a cytotoxic agent, i.e. vinorelbine, plus the dual irreversible EGFR/HER2-tyrosine kinase inhibitor BIBW 2992.
Carcinoma Breast Stage IV
DRUG: BIBW 2992 in combination with vinorelbine
Progression-free survival based on tumor imaging according to RECIST 1.1 criteria., The primary objective is to determine the 6-month Progression free survival rate of BIBW 2992 and vinorelbine i.v. in patients with metastatic, HER2 IHC 2+, HER2 FISH-negative breast cancer. The analysis will be based upon the evaluation of tumour imaging. Disease progression will be evaluated according to the RECIST 1.1 criteria., 6 months defined as the time from the date of treatment start
Overall survival including assessment of objective response rate and time to progression., Objective Response Rate based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST 1.1), Time-to-Progression and Overall Survival., From start of treatment until the date of first documented progression or death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed approximately up to 24 months.|Number, intensity and incidence of adverse events, Safety will be evaluated as indicated by number, intensity and incidence of adverse events, graded according to US NCI CTCAE Version 4.0., Start of treatment up to 28 days after the last administration trial medication.
