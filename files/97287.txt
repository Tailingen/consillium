High Throughput Drug Sensitivity and Genomics Data in Developing Individualized Treatment in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma or Plasma Cell Leukemia
This pilot clinical trial studies whether using high throughput drug sensitivity and genomics data is feasible in developing individualized treatment in patients with multiple myeloma or plasma cell leukemia that has come back or does not respond to treatment. High throughput screen tests many different drugs that kill multiple myeloma cells in individual chambers at the same time. Matching a drug or drug combination to a patient using high throughput screen and genetic information may improve the ability to help patients by choosing drugs that work well for their disease.

PROCEDURE: Biospecimen Collection|DEVICE: High Throughput Screening|OTHER: Laboratory Biomarker Analysis
Actionable assay result, The feasibility of this approach will be assessed in terms of obtaining an actionable response from the proposed assay in at least 50% of patients examined., Up to 21 days
Overall response rate to the therapy chosen after performing the assay, Will be assessed by the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) response criteria. The response among all patients who received the assay as well as among patients who obtained an actionable result from the assay will be estimated., Up to 2 years
OUTLINE:

Patients undergo collection of bone marrow aspirate and blood for high-throughput drug sensitivity assay and mutational analysis using next generation sequencing. Patients and their treating physicians receive the results of the tests. Treatment decisions are then made by the patients and their treating physicians.

After completion of study, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.
