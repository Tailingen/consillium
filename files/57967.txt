A Study of Pyrotinib Plus Capecitabine Versus Lapatinib Plus Capecitabine in Patients With HER2+Metastatic Breast Cancer Who Have Prior Received Anthracyclin, Taxane or Trastuzumab
Pyrotinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting both HER-1 and HER-2 receptors. This study is a randomized, multi-center, multinational, open-label, active-controlled, parallel design study of the combination of pyrotinib plus capecitabine versus the combination of lapatinib plus capecitabine in HER2+ MBC patients who have prior received anthracyclin, taxane or trastuzumab. Patients will be stratified by weather have prior use of trastuzumab and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the following treatment arms:

* Arm A: pyrotinib (400 mg once daily) + capecitabine (1000 mg/m\^2 twice daily)
* Arm B: lapatinib (1250 mg once daily) + capecitabine (1000 mg/m\^2 twice daily) Patients will receive either arm of therapy until the occurrence of death, disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other specified withdrawal criterion.
