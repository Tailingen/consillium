PCAR-119 Bridge Immunotherapy Prior to Stem Cell Transplant in Treating Patients With CD19 Positive Leukemia and Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and optimal dose of PCAR-119 in patients who are going to receive stem cell transplantation but without available treatment to achieve complete remission prior to the transplant.
Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia|Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Follicular Lymphoma|Mantle Cell Lymphoma|B-cell Prolymphocytic Leukemia|Diffuse Large Cell Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: anti-CD19 CAR-NK cells
Adverse events attributed to the administration of the anti-CD19 CAR-NK cells, 2 years
Objective Response Rate, Safety follow-up is 100 days from last CAR-NK infusion
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and optimal dose of PCAR-119 in patients who are going to receive stem cell transplantation but without available treatment to achieve complete remission prior to the transplant. In addition, some patients who enroll to other CD19-CAR-T cell therapy trials might be eligible for this trial if their CD19-CAR-T cells cannot be produced successfully because they have insufficient T cells to allow the CD19-CAR-T cells to be made; their T cells are inefficiently transduced with CAR viruses; or their CAR-T cell expansion is failed.
