Breast Cancer Recurrence - the Accuracy of Dual-time PET/CT
The purpose of this study is to elucidate the value of dual-time-point PET/CT in the recurrence of breast cancer and to determine whether the method is better than the modalities used in the standard work up.

150 patients with suspected breast cancer recurrence will be included. All patients will undergo dual-time-point PET/CT, CT of thorax and upper abdomen and bone scintigraphy. After completion of the examinations the early and the late PET/CT scan will be compared with each other, the diagnostic CT-scan and the bone scintigraphy. A verification of suspicious findings will be done by biopsy, if the area is accessible. If a biopsy cannot be obtained, the presence of recurrence will be verified with additional imaging follow-up to ensure the highest possible confidence. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, negative and positive predictive value (NPV/PPV) will be calculated for each modality (incl. early and late PET/CT).
Breast Cancer Recurrent
RADIATION: Dual-time PET/CT (low-dose)
Diagnostic value of dual-time point 18FDG PET/CT in recurrent breast cancer, The sensitivity and specificity of dual-time point 18FDG PET/CT will be compared to conventional imaging modalities usually used in the work up of patients with suspected recurrent breast cancer. In this case CT of thorax and upper abdomen and bone scintigraphy., 2 years
Diagnostic value of early and late 18FDG PET/CT respectively in recurrent breast cancer, The sensitivity and specificity of early (60 min post injection) and late (180 min post injection) 18FDG PET/CT respectively in patients with suspected recurrent breast cancer., 2 years
