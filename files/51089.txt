A Study of Atezolizumab in Participants With Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) [FIR]
This multicenter, single-arm study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab (MPDL3280A) in participants with PD-L1-positive locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Participants will receive an intravenous (IV) dose of 1200 milligrams (mg) atezolizumab (MPDL3280A) on Day 1 of 21-day cycles until disease progression.

Eligible participants will be categorized in to three groups as follows:

1. Participants with no prior chemotherapy for advanced disease;
2. Participants who progress during or following a prior-platinum based chemotherapy regimen for advanced disease (2L+participants);
3. Participants who are 2L+ and previously treated for brain metastases.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Atezolizumab (MPDL3280A) [TECENTRIQ], an engineered anti-PDL1 antibody
Percentage of Participants With Objective Response According to Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), Objective response was defined as a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), as determined by investigator according to modified RECIST criteria. Modified RECIST was derived from RECIST v1.1 conventions and immune related response criteria. CR was defined as disappearance of all tumor lesions (target lesion \[TL\] and non-target lesion \[non-TL\]) and no new measurable or unmeasurable lesions, all lymph node short axes must be less than 10 millimeters (mm), and PR was defined as at least 30 percent (%) decrease in sum of diameter of TLs and all new measurable lesions since baseline in absence of CR, and both confirmed by consecutive assessment greater than or equal to 4 weeks from date first documented. Participants not meeting these criteria, including participants without at least one post-baseline response assessment were considered as non-responders., Baseline, and Day 1 of Cycle 1 (21-day cycle), then every 6 weeks for the first 12 months and then every 9 weeks thereafter until disease progression (up to 20 months)
Percentage of Participants With Objective Response According to RECIST Version 1.1 (v1.1), Objective response was defined as a CR or PR, as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1. For TLs, CR was defined as disappearance of all TLs. Any pathological lymph nodes, whether target or non-target, must had reduction in short axis to less than 10 mm. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameter of TLs, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters, in absence of CR. For non-TLs, CR was defined as disappearance of all non-TLs and if applicable, normalization of tumor marker level. Participants not meeting these criteria, including participants without at least 1 post-baseline response assessment were considered as non-responders., Baseline, and Day 1 of Cycle 1 (21-day cycle), then every 6 weeks for the first 12 months and then every 9 weeks thereafter until disease progression (up to 20 months)|Duration of Objective Response According to RECIST v1.1, Duration of objective response was defined as time from initial occurrence of documented CR or PR until documented disease progression (using RECIST v1.1 as determined by investigator) or death, whichever occurred first. For TLs, CR was defined as disappearance of all TLs. Any pathological lymph nodes, whether target or non-target, must had reduction in short axis to less than 10 mm. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in sum of diameter of TLs, taking as reference baseline sum of diameters, in absence of CR. Progressive disease was at least a 20% increase in sum of diameters of TLs, taking as reference smallest sum on study (nadir). For non-TLs, CR was defined as disappearance of all non-TLs and if applicable, normalization of tumor marker level. Progressive disease was defined as the appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-TLs. Participants were censored at the date of last tumor assessment., Baseline, and Day 1 of Cycle 1 (21-day cycle), then every 6 weeks for the first 12 months and then every 9 weeks thereafter until disease progression (up to 20 months)|Percentage of Participants With 6-Month Duration of Objective Response, Duration of objective response at 6 months was defined as time from initial occurrence of documented CR or PR until Month 6. For TLs, CR was defined as disappearance of all TLs. Any pathological lymph nodes, whether target or non-target, must have reduction in short axis to less than 10 mm. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in sum of diameter of TLs, taking as reference baseline sum of diameters, in absence of CR. For non-TLs, CR was defined as disappearance of all non-TLs and if applicable, normalization of tumor marker level. Participants were censored at the date of last tumor assessment., Month 6|Percentage of Participants With Disease Progression or Death According to RECIST v1.1, For TLs, progressive disease was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of TLs, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (nadir). For non-TLs, progressive disease was defined as the appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-TLs., Baseline to the first occurrence of progression or death, whichever occurs earlier (up to 20 months)|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) According to RECIST v1.1, PFS was defined as time from randomization to first occurrence of documented disease progression (based on RECIST v1.1 criteria) or death due to any cause within 30 days of the last treatment, whichever occurs earlier as determined by investigator. For TLs, progressive disease was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameter of TLs, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (nadir). For non-TLs, progressive disease was defined as the appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-TLs. In event of no disease progression or documented death, PFS was censored at date of last evaluable tumor assessment. Participants with no post-baseline tumor assessments were censored at the time of first dose plus 1 day., Baseline to the first occurrence of progression or death, whichever occurs earlier (up to 20 months)|Percentage of Participants With PFS at Month 6, Month 12 and Month 30 According to RECIST v1.1, Percentage of participants who were progression free at Month 6 and 12 (based on RECIST v1.1) was reported. For TLs, progressive disease was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameter of TLs, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (nadir).

For participants who continued beyond first documented progression and had follow-up tumor assessment or death, PFS was defined as time from first dose of atezolizumab to subsequent radiographic progression or death. For TLs, progressive disease was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of TLs and new measurable lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum recorded since treatment started. In event of no disease progression or documented death, PFS was censored at date of last evaluable tumor assessment., Baseline to the first occurrence of progression or death, whichever occurs earlier (up to 20 months)|Percentage of Participants With PFS at Month 6, Month 12 and Month 30 According to Modified RECIST, Percentage of participants who were progression free at Months 6 and 12 (according to modified RECIST).
