Cone Beam Computed Tomography for Breast Imaging
The primary aim of this study is to investigate the use of cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) for breast imaging in the diagnostic setting by providing a compelling body of evidence incorporating both non-contrast and contrast enhanced CBCT in the study protocol. The goal is to accumulate a body of evidence to provide data to incorporate CBCT into the diagnostic work-up of breast lesions.
