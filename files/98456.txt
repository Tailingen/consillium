Clinical Trial Evaluating Low Dose G-FLIP Plus Mitomycin C for Stage IV Pancreatic Cancer
The study focuses on advanced metastatic pancreatic cancer, testing a combination of low-dose anti-cancer drugs (G-FLIP: Gemcitabine, Fluorouracil, Leucovorin, Irinotecan, and Oxaliplatin) with the addition of Mitomycin C. The aim is to find a safer and more effective therapy for this devastating disease.
Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: G-GLIP plus Mitomycin C
Overall Survival, This measure assesses the duration of time from the start of the study until death from any cause., Baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and then annually up to 5 years.|Response Rate, This measure assesses the rate of disease progression or worsening, as determined by changes in tumor size and appearance on radiological scans. The evaluation is conducted using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines, which provide a standardized method for measuring tumor size and categorizing response to treatment.", Baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and then annually up to 5 years.
Objective: Evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of G-FLIP combined with Mitomycin C for advanced pancreatic cancer.

Design: Open-label study with 60 evaluable subjects. Treatments: G-FLIP administered every 2 weeks, with Mitomycin administered every 4 weeks.

Efficacy Assessments: Based on response criteria (Complete Response, Partial Response, Stable Disease, Progressive Disease), Response Rate, Progression-Free-Survival, Overall Survival, and 12-Month Survival Rate.

Safety Assessments: Include physical exams, symptom evaluation, vital signs, ECOG performance status, clinical pathology, urinalysis, and Quality of Life assessments.
