Transplant T CD4+ CCR7+ In Hematopoietic Stem Cells Allograft
This is a preclinical study prior to the establishment of a cell therapy protocol applicable to humans.

The main objective is to evaluate the decrease in alloreactivity of TCD4 + population by partial selective depletion of CD4 + CCR7 + graft to less than 50 % of CD4 + totals. To test the alloreactivity of donor T lymphocytes.
Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: blood
Change the lymphocyte proliferation will be evaluated using a scintillation spectrometer, Decrease in alloreactivity of TCD4.(composite) Decrease population by partial selective depletion of CD4 + CCR7 + graft to less than 50% of total CD4 +will be evaluated on this basis criteria., 1 day, 5 day ,8 day|Change the functional properties of cells will be evaluated by T-SPOT TB®., Decrease in alloreactivity of TCD4.(composite) Decrease population by partial selective depletion of CD4 + CCR7 + graft to less than 50% of total CD4 +will be evaluated on this basis criteria., 1 day, 5 day ,8 day
Response to anti-infectious immunity, Measure the anti-infectious immunity during a partial selective depletion of TCD4 + CCR7 + (≤ 50%), 24 months|Response to anti-tumor immunity, Measure the anti-tumor immunity during a partial selective depletion of TCD4 + CCR7 + (≤ 50%), 24 months
This is a preclinical study prior to the establishment of a cell therapy protocol applicable to humans.

The main objective is to evaluate the decrease in alloreactivity of TCD4 + population by partial selective depletion of CD4 + CCR7 + graft to less than 50 % of CD4 + totals. To test the alloreactivity of donor T lymphocytes , T lymphocytes CD4 + CCR7 + donor will be stimulated by mature dendritic cells (DC) derived from recipient circulating monocytes in a mixed lymphocyte reaction model sensitized ( MLDCR ) , experiencing HLA -compatibility . This first step will confirm the results previously obtained in a situation incompatible HLA .
