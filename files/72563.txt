Study of Pembrolizumab, Radiation and Immune Modulatory Cocktail in Cervical/Uterine Cancer
This is a Phase II study in patients with advanced and/refractory cervical cancer, endometrial carcinoma or uterine sarcoma.

Patients will be treated with an immunomodulatory cocktail (Vitamin D, aspirin, Cyclophosphamide and Lansoprazole), followed by pembrolizumab, combined with radiation. In addition, patients will take Curcumin, a food supplement.

Objective response rate at week 26, Efficacy (objective response rate) at week 26 according to immune related response criteria (irRC), week 26
Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (Safety according to CTCAE4.0)., The number of unmanageable dose limiting toxicities will be reported for the run-in period and the main trial. This analysis will be performed for both the Full Analysis Set (FAS; evaluable patiÃ«nts) and extended FAS (eFAS; all patients included in the trial)., up to 30 days post end of study treatment|Objective response rate, Objective response rate at week 26 according to RECIST criteria, week 26|Best OR, Best overall response, week 26|PFS, At weeks 26, 52, 75, 104, 130 and 156 the proportion of progression-free patients will be estimated with a 95% confidence interval., up to 156 weeks|Median PFS, At weeks 26, 52, 75, 104, 130 and 156 the median PFS will be calculated., up to 156 weeks|OS, At weeks 26, 52, 75, 104, 130 and 156 the proportion of patients surviving will be estimated with a 95% confidence interval., up to 156 weeks|Median OS, At weeks 26, 52, 75, 104, 130 and 156 the median survival will be calculated., up to 156 weeks|Quality of life assessment, Quality of life as measured by FACT-Cx questionnaire for the cervical cancer group and by the FACT-G questionnaire for the endometrial carcinoma and uterine sarcoma group. Descriptive statistics of the total score at each visit and the difference with the baseline visit for all other visits will be reported., Quality of life questionnaires will be completed by the patients at baseline, after 3 months of therapy, after 6 months of treatment (end of treatment) and finally 3 months after therapy.
This is a Phase II multi-center, open-label, non-randomized, 3-cohort study in patients with advanced and/or refractory cervical cancer, endometrial carcinoma or uterine sarcoma. Patients will be treated by an immunomodulatory cocktail (consisting of a daily intake of 2000 IU Vitamin D, 325 mg aspirin, 50 mg Cyclophosphamide and 180 or 30 mg Lansoprazole alternating weekly), followed by pembrolizumab administered intravenously at 200 mg in 21-day treatment cycles, combined with radiation (3x 8Gy in 48h-intervals). In addition, patients will take Curcumin, a food supplement on a daily basis.
