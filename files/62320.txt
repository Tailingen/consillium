Progression-Free Survival (PFS) by BICR, Progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by a Blind Independent Center Review Committee (BICR) with reference to RECIST v1.1 for Solid tumors, 3 years
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) by the investigator, Refer to RECIST v1.1, PFS assessed by the investigator, 2 years|Intracranial Overall Response Rate（ORR）, To evaluate the intracranial Overall Response Rate（ORR）which is defined by investigator as the proportion of subjects with Intracranial disease confirmed best overall response of complete response or partial response per RECIST v 1.1., 3 years|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the date of first documented response (CR or PR) until the date of documented progression or death, whichever comes first., 3 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of participants achieving complete or partial response or stable disease as defined per RECIST v 1.1, 3 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of the first dose until the date of death due to any cause., 3 years|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug assessed by CTCAE v5.0, 3 years|Plasma concentrations of PLB1004 and metabolites may be combined with data from other clinical studies, Plasma concentrations of PLB1004 and metabolites may be combined with data from other clinical studies, 3 years
intracranial Progression-Free Survival（PFS）, Reference RECIST v1.1, intracranial PFS assessed by BICR and investigator, 3 years|second progression-free survival (PFS2), Investigator-assessed second progression-free survival (PFS2), 3 years|Assess the Quality of Healthy Living About Patients, Use the EQ-5D-5L scale to measure patients' quality of healthy living. It has 5 items (Mobility, Self-care, Usual activities, Pain/discomfort, Depression/anxiety). Each item contains 5 levels: 1= no difficulty, 2= slight difficulty, 3= moderate difficulty, 4= serious difficulty, 5= extremely serious difficulty. The higher the score has the worse the health. Then, the score calculation of the European Five-Dimensional Health Scale is based on the calculation formula published by the EuroQol Group. Based on 5 combinations of different severity levels, a score of 0 to 1 is obtained. 0 is the least healthy and 1 is the most healthy., 3 years|EGFR Ex20ins status in tumor tissues and its relevance to the clinical efficacy of drugs, EGFR Ex20ins status in tumor tissues and its relevance to the clinical efficacy of drugs, 3 years|Gene mutation status in plasma ctDNA before and after medication, and its correlation with clinical efficacy, To assess the expression of circulating tumor DNA in ascites and blood, ctDNA was mesured at screen, cycle 3 and end of the study, 3 years
Randomized, controlled, open label, multicenter phase III study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PLB1004 Versus platinum-based chemotherapy with or without Sintilimab in the first-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer with Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Exon 20 insertion(ex 20) mutations.
