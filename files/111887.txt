A Study of the Safety and Effectiveness of Apixaban in Preventing Blood Clots in Children With Leukemia Who Have a Central Venous Catheter and Are Treated With Asparaginase
The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of a blood thinning drug called Apixaban versus no administration of a blood thinning drug, in preventing blood clots in children with leukemia or lymphoma. Patients must be receiving chemotherapy, including asparaginase, and have a central line (a catheter inserted for administration of medications and blood sampling)

CRNM bleeding is defined as bleeding that satisfies one or both of the following:

1. overt bleeding for which blood product is administered and not directly attributable to the subject's underlying medical condition and
2. bleeding that requires medical or surgical intervention to restore hemostasis, other than in an operating room, From first dose up to approximately 34 days after first dose|The Number of Participant Deaths, The number of participant deaths adjudicated by a blinded, independent adjudication committee, From first dose date until the end of the treatment period + 30 days (Up to approximately 59 days)|The Number of Participants With an Arterial Thromboembolic Event, The number of participants with an arterial thromboembolic event including paradoxical embolism and stroke adjudicated by a blinded, independent adjudication committee, From first dose up to approximately 34 days after first dose|The Number of Participants With a CVAD-Related Infection, The number of participants with a central venous access device (CVAD)-related infection adjudicated by a blinded, independent adjudication committee, From first dose up to approximately 34 days after first dose|The Number of Participants Needing Catheter Replacements During the Study, The number of participants needing catheter replacements during the study, From first dose up to approximately 34 days after first dose|The Number of Participants With CVAD Patency Restoration Events After Thrombolytic Therapy Use, The number of participants with central venous access device (CVAD) patency restoration events after thrombolytic therapy use, From first dose up to approximately 34 days after first dose|The Number Participants Experiencing Superficial Vein Thrombosis Events, The number participants experiencing superficial vein thrombosis events.

Clots that occur in a superficial vein ie, cephalic vein, basilic vein (upper extremity) or saphenous vein (lower extremity) confirmed by radiographic imaging., From first dose up to approximately 34 days after first dose|The Number of Participants With Clinically Relevant Non-Major Bleeding Events (CRNMB), The number of participants with clinically relevant non-major bleeding events (CRNMB) adjudicated by a blinded, independent adjudication committee.

CRNM bleeding is defined as bleeding that satisfies one or both of the following:

1. overt bleeding for which blood product is administered and not directly attributable to the subject's underlying medical condition and
2. bleeding that requires medical or surgical intervention to restore hemostasis, other than in an operating room, From first dose up to approximately 34 days after first dose|The Number of Participants With Minor Bleeding Events, The number of participants with minor bleeding events adjudicated by a blinded, independent adjudication committee.

Minor bleeding defined as any overt or macroscopic evidence of bleeding that does not fulfill the criteria for either major bleeding or CRNMB, From first dose up to approximately 34 days after first dose|The Number of Platelet Transfusions Needed During the Study, The number of platelet transfusions needed during the study.

The events are not adjudicated. A subject could have more than one platelet transfusion., From first dose up to approximately 34 days after first dose|Maximum Observed Concentration (Cmax), The maximum observed concentration (Cmax) was measured to assess the pharmacokinetics of oral or enteric apixaban in pediatric subjects receiving induction chemotherapy., pre-dose, 1-4 hours post dose|Trough Observed Concentration (Cmin), The trough observed concentration (Cmin) was measured to assess the pharmacokinetics of oral or enteric apixaban in pediatric subjects receiving induction chemotherapy., pre-dose, 1-4 hours post dose|Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve [AUC(TAU)], The area under the concentration-time curve \[AUC(TAU)\] was measured to assess the pharmacokinetics of oral or enteric apixaban in pediatric subjects receiving induction chemotherapy., pre-dose, 1-4 hours post dose|Anti-FXa Activity, Anti-FXa Activity was measured to characterize the relationship between apixaban plasma concentration and anti-FXa activity in pediatric subjects receiving induction chemotherapy, pre-dose and 2.5 hours after dosing on day 7.
