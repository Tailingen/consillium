Impact of a Sexological Follow-up on the Sexual Function in Patients With Cervix or Vaginal Cancer Treated by Radiotherapy and Brachytherapy
Prospective, monocentric study evaluating the impact of a nurse-led sexological follow-up on sexual function in patients with cervix or vaginal cancer treated by radiotherapy and brachytherapy.

The study procedure will consist of nurse-led sexological consultations, beginning before brachytherapy and until 2 months after brachytherapy.

Evolution of female sexual function and vaginal symptoms will be done through clinical examinations and completion of quality of life and female sexual function questionnaires during radiation oncologist consultation and/or nurse-led sexological consultations until one year after end of brachytherapy.

Study participation of each patient will be 12 months.
