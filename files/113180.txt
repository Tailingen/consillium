LY3022855 With BRAF/MEK Inhibition in Patients With Melanoma
This research study is studying a combination of targeted therapies as a possible treatment for advanced melanoma that was found to have a BRAF V600E or BRAF V600K genetic mutation

The interventions involved in this study are:

* LY3022855
* Vemurafenib
* Cobimetinib
Melanoma
DRUG: LY3022855|DRUG: Vemurafenib|DRUG: Cobimetinib
Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) [Phase I], DLT is based on CTCAE v4.03. DLT refers to toxicities experienced during the first cycle of treatment that are possibly, probably, or definitely related to the study medication regimen, and grade or category outlined in protocol section 5.4., Participants were assessed cycle 1 on day 1, 8, 15 and 22. The observation period for DLT evaluation was the first cycle (28 days).|LY3022855 Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) With Vemurafenib and Cobimetinib Combination [Phase I], See previous primary outcome measure for the DLT defination. A conventional algorithm (3+3 design) will be used to identify the MTD, escalating on 0/3 or 1/6 DLTs, and de-escalating if two DLTs are encountered. The MTD will be the highest dose level at which ≤ 1/6 subjects experience a DLT. If dose level 1 is discovered to be intolerable (with 2/3 or ≥ 2/6 subjects experiencing a DLT), the trial will be discontinued., Participants were assessed cycle 1 on day 1, 8, 15 and 22. The observation period is the first cycle (28 days).
Median Progression-Free Survival (PFS) [Phase I], Progression-free survival based on the Kaplan-Meier method is defined as the duration of time from study entry to documented disease progression (PD) or death. Per RECIST 1.1 criteria., Disease was assessed radiologically at baseline and after treatment every 3-4 months. Median follow-up for survival was 202 days with maximum of 480 days.|Overall Response Rate (ORR) [Phase I], The overall response rate (ORR) was defined as the percentage of participants achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on RECISTv1.1 criteria., Radiologic measurements is performed at Cycle 2 Day 28 and at the day 28 of every 2 cycles of treatment thereafter. Median treatment duration is 112 days (range 56 - 1008 days ).|Grade 3-5 Treatment-related Toxicity Rate [Phase II], All grade 3-5 adverse events (AE) with treatment attribution of possibly, probably or definite based on CTCAEv4.03 that are not resolved in accordance with treatment guidelines were counted. Rate is the proportion of treated participants experiencing at least one of these adverse events as defined during the time of observation., AE evaluated on treatment on each cycle at day 1, 8, 15 and 22. Median treatment duration for this study cohort was 112 days (range 56 - 1008 days).
This is a Phase I/II clinical trial. A Phase I clinical trial tests the safety of an investigational intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational intervention to use for further studies. "Investigational" means that the intervention is being studied.

The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved LY3022855 as a treatment for any disease.

The FDA has approved vemurafenib and cobimetinib as treatment options for this disease.

LY3022855 is a colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R) inhibitor. It is a human monoclonal antibody. A monoclonal antibody is a type of protein made in the laboratory that can locate and bind to substances in the body, including tumor cells. By binding to the tumor cells, the antibody might prevent the tumor cell from growing and spreading. LY3022855 is being developed as a treatment for patients with advanced cancer.

Vemurafenib and cobimetinib attack different proteins that promote the growth of cancerous cells. Vemurafenib is a BRAF inhibitor that works by blocking altered BRAF proteins from stimulating the growth of melanoma cancer cells. Cobimetinib works by blocking a protein called MEK that has been known to promote melanoma growth. In order to participate in the study, participant's disease needs to be tested positive for a mutation (a permanent change in the DNA sequence of a gene) of the BRAF gene that belongs to a class of genes known as oncogenes. When mutated, oncogenes have the potential to cause normal cells to become cancerous. Once the BRAF gene is mutated, the normal functioning of the BRAF protein may be changed.

In this research study, the investigators are combining LY3022855 with vemurafenib and cobimetinib in the hopes that the LY3022855 will enhance how your cancer responds to vemurafenib and cobimetinib.
