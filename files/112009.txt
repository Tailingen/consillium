Evaluation Using FAPI-PET Targeting Cancer-associated Fibroblasts
PET / CT examination using \[18F\] FAPI-74 is performed on patients diagnosed with malignant tumor, and the pathological condition is determined by comparing with FDG-PET/CT examination of conventional diagnostic imaging.
Neoplasms
DRUG: PET/CT ([F-18]FAPI-74)
Comparison of the uptake on FAPI-PET with conventional imaging, Comparison of SUV (standardized uptake value) of primary site and metastatic lesions between FAPI-PET and FDG-PET, Within 2 hours after administration of [F-18]FAPI-74 injection|Comparison with pathological specimens, Comparison of expression level (staining score) in FAP immunostaining and SUV in FAPI-PET (FAP staining is graded by scoring evaluation: high expression (3 points), moderate expression (2 points), mild expression (1 point), and no significant expression (0 point).), Within one month after FAPI-PET|Time course of uptake on FAPI-PET, Time course of uptake on FAPI-PET before and after treatment compared with conventional imaging, Approximately 6 months after initial FAPI-PET
Cancer stroma accounts for more than 90% of all tumors, and cancer-related fibroblasts (CAFs) play an important role in the growth and progression of cancer. FAP expressed in CAF has been found to be expressed in many cancers, and \[68Ga\] FAPI-04 and \[18F\] FAPI-74, which are PET diagnostic agents for FAP ligand FAPI, have been used all over the world. The purpose of this study is to perform PET / CT using \[18F\] FAPI-74 injection for patients diagnosed with malignant tumors, mainly pancreatic cancer and gastric cancer to evaluate the pathology in detail by comparing with the FDG-PET/CT.
