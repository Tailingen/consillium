Comparison of Two Concomitant Administration of RT With Cisplatin in Standard Infusion or Fractional Infusion
The general aim is to compare the cumulative dose of cisplatin administered concomitantly with radiotherapy in reference arm A (cisplatin 100 mg / m2 day 1 every 21 days) and in the experimental arm B (Cisplatin split 25 mg / m2 / J D1 to D4 all 21 days).

The standard treatment for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck locally advanced non-operated or non-operable is a combination of radiotherapy and concomitant chemotherapy. Indeed, the meta-analysis MACH showed for RT / CT associations an absolute survival benefit of 8% compared with radiotherapy alone. Cisplatin delivered optimally, ie at a dose of 100 mg / m2 on day 1, D22 and D43 of radiotherapy is as effective as combinations of cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil.

In post operative, treatment of high risk recurrence forms by Cisplatin, concomitantly with radiotherapy, also increases local control and overall survival.

However, it is an association whose toxicity is significant. The usual limiting toxicities were mucositis, dysphagia, nausea and vomiting with malnutrition and biologically kidney failure and myelotoxicity. Only 2/3 of the patients receive 3 cycles of cisplatin initially programmed.

As shown in the RTOG 0129 trial, the number of cycles of cisplatin and thus the cumulative dose of cisplatin administered concurrently with radiation therapy, significantly influences the locoregional control, progression free survival and overall survival.

One method of reducing the toxicity and thereby, increase the cumulative dose, would be to split the administration of cisplatin.

Moreover, the efficacy of Cisplatin, which only the free fraction is active, seems correlated with AUC that peak plasma which would in turn responsible for toxicity. The completion of a pharmacokinetic study comparing the AUC and Cmax obtained with cisplatin 100 mg / m2 and cisplatin fractionated is essential.

Finally, the limiting renal toxicity induced by cisplatin is currently diagnosed using the creatinine clearance. The Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) urinary is a new diagnosis and prognosis marker of renal impairment following treatment with cisplatin. However, further studies are needed to validate its clinical utility.
