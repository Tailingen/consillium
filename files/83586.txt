A Study of MK-0482 as Monotherapy and in Combination With Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors (MK-0482-001)
This is a 2 part study. Part 1 is a dose escalation to determine the safety and tolerability and to establish a preliminary recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) dose of MK-0482 administered as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in participants with advanced solid tumors for which there is no available therapy which may convey clinical benefit. Part 2 is expansion cohort to determine safety and tolerability of MK-0482 in combination with pembrolizumab with and without chemotherapy in participants with advanced tumor specific cohorts.
