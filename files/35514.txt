Molecularly Aided Stratification for Tumor Eradication Research
NCT/DKFZ/DKTK MASTER is a prospective, continuously recruiting, multicenter observational study for biology-guided stratification of adults with rare cancers, including rare subtypes of common entities, using comprehensive molecular profiling, and clinical decision-making in a multidisciplinary molecular tumor board.
