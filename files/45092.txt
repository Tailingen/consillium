Role of the Cystic Fluid Interleukins and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) Levels in Characterizing Pancreatic Cysts Detected by Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS)
This study aims to find a correlation between cytokines levels and malignancy potential of different cystic types.
Pancreatic Cancer
PROCEDURE: EUS with fine-needle aspiration of pancreatic cyst|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Laboratory Blood test
Prediction of malignant potential of pancreatic cyst by measuring Interleukin levels, Interleukin 1,8,10 will be measured quantitatively by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The same interleukins levels will be measured in serum of same patients and control group. Results will enable classification of cysts to either high or low risk malignancy potential., Two years|Prediction of malignant potential of pancreatic cyst by measuring TNF levels, TNF levels will be measured quantitatively by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
