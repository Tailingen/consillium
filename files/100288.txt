Intercalated Combination of Chemotherapy and Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors as First-line Treatment for Patients With Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer
Objective: To compare the efficacy and safety of chemotherapy plus intercalated EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) combination therapy with TKI alone therapy as first-line treatment for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Methods: Patients with untreated, stage IIIB/IV, EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC will be randomly assigned to combination therapy group (receiving four cycles of docetaxel or pemetrexed (on day 1) plus platinum (on day 1) with intercalated TKI (gefitinib, erlotinib or Icotinib, on day 2-15) every 3 weeks) or TKI alone therapy (gefitinib, erlotinib or Icotinib, daily). All patients were continued to receive TKI until progression or unacceptable to toxicity or death. The primary endpoint was progression-free survivial (PFS).

Expected results: PFS of combination therapy group will be prolonged to nineteen months while PFS of TKI alone therapy group is ten months. Overall survival (OS) of combination therapy group will be prolonged to 36 months while OS of TKI alone therapy group is 26 months.

Hypothesis: Platinum-based chemotherapy plus intercalated TKI combination therapy as first-line treatment will prolong PFS and OS for patients with NSCLC.

DRUG: Erlotinib|DRUG: Gefitinib|DRUG: Icotinib|DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Pemetrexed|DRUG: Platinum (cisplatin or carboplatin)|DRUG: Erlotinib|DRUG: Gefitinib|DRUG: Icotinib
Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined to be the time from randomization to progression of disease or death, whichever occurs first. Progressive disease is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study, or appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions., 8 weeks
Objective response rate, 8 weeks|Duration of response, 8 weeks|Time to progression, 8 weeks|Overall survival (OS), 8 weeks|Clinical benefit rate, 8 weeks|Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), laboratory data, 4 weeks
