Phase 1b/2 Study of Oprozomib in Combination With Sorafenib in Subjects With Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The purpose of Phase 1b of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PDn) and assess the safety, tolerability and activity of oprozomib in combination with sorafenib in subjects with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

The purpose of Phase 2 of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of oprozomib in combination with sorafenib versus sorafenib alone and to compare the key outcome measures for subjects with advanced HCC.
Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: Oprozomib|DRUG: Sorafenib
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) - Phase 1b, To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and identify the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of oprozomib in combination with sorafenib in subjects with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)., 16 months|Time To Progression (TTP) - Phase 2, To evaluate the efficacy of oprozomib in combination with sorafenib versus sorafenib alone in subjects with advanced HCC, as measured by time to progression (TTP), defined as time from randomization to disease progression., 16 months
Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) - Phase 1b & Phase 2, Number of patients that experience Adverse Events (AEs). Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) graded according to the NCI-CTCAE (Version 4.03)., Until 30 days after the end of study (32 months)|Pharmacokinetics (PK) parameters - Phase 1b, Evaluate population pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters, including maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax), area under the curve at the last measurable time point (AUC0-t), and area under the curve extrapolated to infinity (AUC0-inf) using noncompartmental methods., 16 months|Pharmacodynamic (PDn) parameter - Phase 1b, The extent of inactivation of proteasome activity in red blood cells (RBCs) after oprozomib dosing will be monitored as a PDn parameter. Pharmacodynamic inhibition will be listed by dose cohort, exposure, and response status., 16 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR) - Phase 2, To estimate the overall response rate (ORR), defined as the proportion of subjects with a best overall response of complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) for subjects receiving oprozomib in combination with sorafenib and for subjects receiving sorafenib alone., 16 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS) - Phase 2, Progression-free survival (PFS), defined as time from randomization to the earlier of PD or death due to any cause., 16 months|Overall Survival (OS) - Phase 2, Overall survival (OS) is defined as time from randomization to death due to any cause., 16 months
