Studying First Line Treatment of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) in a Real-world Setting
The purpose of this study is to better understand the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in patients newly diagnosed with CML and their quality of life in a real-world setting.
Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
The rate of Complete Cytogenetic Response, 12 months|The duration of initial TKI treatment, Initiation of first-line TKI, (whether Dasatinib, Imatinib, Nilotinib), 5-years from study index date|The rate of discontinuation and treatment changes after initial TKI treatment, Dates of switches in therapy from initial TKI treatment, Reasons for treatment discontinuation (i.e. side effects, mutations, etc.), Subsequent lines of CML treatments (start and stop dates), Every 6 months for a follow-up period of 5-years from study index date|The rate of best response to therapy (i.e. hematologic, cytogenetic, molecular response), Results and dates of: all bone marrow aspirates, blood tests, cytogenetics, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), Fluorescent In-Situ Hybridization (FISH), and Physical exam, Every 6 months for a follow-up period of 5-years from study index date|The adherence to treatment, Morisky Medication Adherence Scale - 8 Items is a validated self-reported measure of medication adherence., Every 6 months for a follow-up period of 5-years from study index date
Impact of first-line treatment options on quality of life, Questionnaires used for assessment:

Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G), Cancer Therapy Satisfaction Questionnaire (CTSQ), MD Anderson Symptom Inventory - CML (MDASI-CML)., Every 6 months|Non-hematologic side effects from treatment affecting patient quality of life and outcomes, Treatment discontinuations and changes, Every 6 months|Patient satisfaction with CML treatment, Cancer Therapy Satisfaction Questionnaire (CTSQ), Every 6 months|Patterns of disease monitoring as observed in a real-world setting, MD Anderson Symptom Inventory - CML (MDASI-CML) Questionnaire - disease-specific module of the MDASI7 which is a brief measure of severity and impact of cancer-related symptoms on daily function, Every 6 months|Resource utilization associated with CML management, To evaluate healthcare resource utilization, descriptive statistics will describe real-world disease monitoring patterns, frequency of testing, and resources used for disease management for each treatment cohort., Every 6 months
Time Perspective : Most patients are expected to be a mix of retrospective and prospective data collection. Patients can be enrolled after their study index date (retrospective component) and have to be followed until 5 years from study index date are complete (time between enrollment and 5 year follow-up is the prospective component)
