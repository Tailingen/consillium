Upper Extremity Lymphatic Mapping for Breast Cancer Patients
This study is being done to see if lymph nodes that drain the arm also drain the breast. An axillary lymph node dissection removes lymph nodes under the arm. It is done to help prevent cancer cells from spreading to the rest of the body. Usually, about 12 to 15 nodes are removed. They are then examined to see if they have cancer cells. Removing these lymph nodes has some side effects. The most common is lymphedema. This is the build-up of fluid in the arm. This study will tell us if it may be possible in the future to identify lymph nodes that just drain the arm. Leaving those nodes may help to reduce the rate of lymphedema for future patients.
