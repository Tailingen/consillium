Radiotherapy & Combi in Metastatic Melanoma
The purpose of this study is to investigate the side effects and safety, and effectiveness of combining dabrafenib and trametinib with radiotherapy.

Previous and ongoing clinical trials have demonstrated the effectiveness and safety of combining both dabrafenib and trametinib compared with dabrafenib alone. This has led to the approval for the use of both drugs in combination in people with metastatic melanoma with the BRAF mutation. Melanoma that has spread to other parts of the body may also benefit from radiotherapy to help reduce symptoms from melanoma. Previous studies have shown that melanoma may be sensitive to radiotherapy and that it can help to improve quality of life.

The intention of the CombiRT study is to establish if dabrafenib, trametinib and radiotherapy combined is a safe and effective treatment for metastatic melanoma.
