Optimal Nutritional Palliation of Obstructed GEJ Cancer
The main goal of this trial is to assess whether it's feasible to conduct a larger, full-scale study comparing the use of gastrostomy (g-tubes) and stents in patients with unresectable cancer of the stomach and/or esophagus, and to evaluate their impact on patients' quality of life. Additional objectives include examining the rates of complications, the need for additional treatments, and the total number of hospital days over a three-month period.
