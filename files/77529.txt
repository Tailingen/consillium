Statin Addition to Chemotherapy for Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
The results of previous studies conducted by our team have revealed that the use of statins can more effectively hinder the growth of drug-resistant pancreatic cancer cells. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the role of statins in treating pancreatic cancer by assessing the safety and therapeutic impact of combining chemotherapy with statins in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.

The poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer is not just because of the high malignancy of the tumor itself, but also its poor response to chemotherapy. Gemcitabine and fluorouracil are the primary drugs utilized in pancreatic cancer treatment, and combination chemotherapy predominantly revolves around these two drugs. Nevertheless, findings from clinical studies reveal that approximately one-third of pancreatic cancer patients display resistance to chemotherapy, with the majority of the remaining patients eventually developing secondary resistance within six months following treatment. Consequently, chemotherapy resistance constitutes a significant factor contributing to the poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients.

Our research team established a biobank containing over 300 pancreatic cancer organoids. Using high-throughput drug sensitivity detection techniques, the investigators assessed the sensitivity of 177 pancreatic cancer organoids to five commonly used chemotherapeutics and 84 tumor-related drugs or regimens. The findings suggest that pancreatic cancer organoids that are generally resistant to chemotherapy drugs exhibit sensitivity to statins. These findings indicate that combining chemotherapy with statins may enhance the therapeutic effect for pancreatic cancer patients. Previous studies have also reported the potential therapeutic effects of statins in colorectal, lung and breast cancer.

In summary, chemotherapy resistance is a significant factor contributing to the poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer. Building on previous research conducted by our team, this study aims to investigate the role of statins in pancreatic cancer through a single-arm clinical trial, with the goal to investigate the role of statins in treating pancreatic cancer.
