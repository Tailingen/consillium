Evaluate the Clinical Usefulness of [F-18]Florastamin PET/CT Imaging Diagnosis Compared to MRI Diagnosis
Only in subjects who satisfy the inclusion/exclusion criteria, a single dose of \[F-18\]Florastamin at 10 ± 1 mCi is IV administered at Visit 2, and \[F-18\]Florastamin PET/CT images are obtained from the head to thigh after 110 ± 10 minutes.

Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity analyzed for patients based on histological findings, For the sensitivity and specificity analyzed for patients of MRI diagnostic imaging and PET/CT diagnostic imaging based on histological findings, present the frequency, percentage and corresponding 95% confidence interval for each group, and conduct the McNemar's test for between-group difference. If the p-value from the McNemar's test is \<0.05 for both sensitivity and specificity, superiority of PET/CT diagnostic imaging to MRI diagnostic imaging is declared., MRI and PET/CT conduct at V2(0 day), TPM Biopsy conduct at V3(V2+1~14 day).

Once a subject provides voluntary written consent on participation in this study, the investigator conducts screening of the subject. Subsequently, MRI and \[F-18\]Florastamin PET/CT are performed for each patient, only for those who satisfy the inclusion/exclusion criteria. For MRI at Visit 2, routine MRI, as implemented in the Urology Department, is performed in the abdomen and pelvis. On the date of or within 7 days after MRI, a single dose of \[F-18\]Florastamin at 10 ± 1 mCi is IV administered to a subject, and PET/CT images are obtained from the head to thigh after 110 ± 10 minutes (care should be taken to prevent extravasation of the radiopharmaceutical product). At Visit 3, the principal investigator or a treating doctor as delegated by the principal investigator conducts the template prostate-mapping (TPM) biopsy in at least the Modified Barzell 20-zone using the standard template. After general anesthesia or spinal anesthesia, the tissue is collected by horizontally sticking a histological needle through the perineum, and the process can be performed as in-patient, at the discretion of the investigator.

The MRI finding is determined positive for a lesion with the PI-RADS score of 3 or higher, and the \[F-18\]Florastamin PET/CT finding is considered positive for the focal uptake higher than the background level and unrelated with the physiologic uptake or known pitfall.

MRI and \[F-18\]Florastamin PET/CT images are sent to the central reading institution, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, after blinding for the study information. Suspected sites on MRI are evaluated at the Seoul St. Mary's Hospital Radiology Department, and the suspected sites on \[F-18\]Florastamin PET/CT are assessed at the Seoul St. Mary's Hospital Nuclear Medicine Department. Note that the \[F-18\]Florastamin PET/CT rater would participate in the assessment after undergoing sufficient training with \[F-18\]Florastamin PET/CT images from a Phase 1 study of the same product.

A pathologist at each center will conduct diagnosis of prostate cancer for TPM biopsy samples from the entire prostate volume. Target biopsy of MRI and \[F-18\]Florastamin PET/CT will not be performed. By comparing confirmed sites from each imaging diagnosis method and positive/negative results for prostate cancer from TPM biopsy diagnosis, the proportions of True Positive (TP), False Positive (FP), True Negative (TN), False Negative (FN) will be analyzed and the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value, and diagnostic accuracy will be compared using a 2x2 contingency table.
