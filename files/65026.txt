This phase IIb study will evaluate the efficacy and the safety of 3 dose-levels of ABX464, administered daily in improving Modified Mayo Score (MMS) in patients with moderate to severe Ulcerative Colitis who have inadequate response, loss of response, or intolerance with at least one of the following agents: immunosuppressant treatment (i.e. azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate), tumor necrosis factor alpha \[TNF-α\] inhibitors, vedolizumab, JAK inhibitors and/or corticosteroid treatment .

Eligible patients will be randomized into 4 parallel intervention/treatment groups: 25mg q.d of ABX464, 50mg q.d of ABX464, 100mg q.d of ABX464, or matching placebo and will be treated for 16 weeks.
