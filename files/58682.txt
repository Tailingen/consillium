Scoring: answers to each question are scored which are then summed and transformed to a 0 - 100 scale.

The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability., before intervention; follow-up: 3 months after intervention|Change of amplitude of Muscle activity, use electromyography to measure the muscles activity in microvolts (uv) included quadriceps, hamstrings, tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius during subject walking in self-selected speed in 6 meters., before intervention; follow-up: 3 months after intervention
Change of concentration of CRP (C-Reactive Protein), The concentration of CRP in the blood test. CRP is used mainly as a marker of inflammation., before intervention; follow-up: 3 months after intervention|Change of concentration of ALB (Serum albumin), The concentration of ALB in the blood test. Albumin is the most important contributor to the maintenance of plasma colloid oncotic pressure; deficiency results in edema., before intervention; follow-up: 3 months after intervention|Change of concentration of Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR), The concentration of GFR in the blood test. The glomerular filtration rate is the best test to measure the patient's level of kidney function and determine the stage of kidney disease. It can calculate it from the results of the blood creatinine test., before intervention; follow-up: 3 months after intervention|Change of concentration of Hemoglobin (Hb), The concentration of Hb in the blood test., Time Frame: before intervention; follow-up: 3 months after intervention|Change of concentration of Glucose SPOT, The concentration of Glucose SPOT in the blood test. TheSpot glucose measurement in epidermal interstitial fluid appears to be a promising alternative to capillary blood glucose estimation, Time Frame: before intervention; follow-up: 3 months after intervention|Change of concentration of Cholesterol, The concentration of Cholesterol in the blood test., before intervention; follow-up: 3 months after intervention|Change of concentration of Triglyceride, The concentration of Triglyceride in the blood test., before intervention; follow-up: 3 months after intervention|Change of concentration of Transferrin, The concentration of Transferrin in the blood test., before intervention; follow-up: 3 months after intervention|Change of Berg balance test (BBS), including 14 items which are scored on a 5 points scale (0-4). The degree of success in achieving each task is given a score of zero (unable) to four (independent), and the final measure is the sum of all of the scores.

orientation, registration, attention and calculation, recall, and language. The maximum score is 30. A score of 23 or lower is indicative of cognitive impairment., before intervention; follow-up: 3 months after intervention|Change of Modified Ashworth scale (MAS), measures resistance during passive soft-tissue stretching, the score is ranged from 0-4 0: No increase in muscle tone

1. Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch and release or by minimal resistance at the end of the range of motion when the affected part(s) is moved in flexion or extension 1+: Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch, followed by minimal resistance throughout the remainder (less than half) of the ROM
2. More marked increase in muscle tone through most of the ROM, but affected part(s) easily moved
3. Considerable increase in muscle tone, passive movement difficult
4. Affected part(s) rigid in flexion or extension, before intervention; follow-up: 3 months after intervention|Change of Muscle tone, measure the muscle tone (kg/m) under muscle resting. Target muscles are quadricep, hamstring, anterior tibialis, gastrocnemius., before intervention; follow-up: 3 months after intervention
The main common chronic diseases in the elderly such as stroke, osteoporosis, chronic kidney disease and cancer, have been regarded as the fall high-risk patients. These patients are considered to be at risk for sarcopenia due to decreased exercise, nutritional status, and other reasons. Sarcopenia can be diagnosed and intervened effectively to delay the vicious cycle of health. Past studies have pointed out that in addition to drug intervention, treatment for sarcopenia must be accompanied by appropriate exercise and nutritional intervention (such as protein supplements, vitamin D) in order to achieve the best prevention and treatment.
