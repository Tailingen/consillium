KRT-232 and TKI Study in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
This study evaluates KRT-232, a novel oral small molecule inhibitor of MDM2, for the treatment of patients with Ph+ Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) who have relapsed or are refractory or intolerant to a Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI).

This study is a global, open label Phase 1b/2 to determine the efficacy and safety of KRT-232 in patients with chronic phase CML (CML-CP) and accelerated phase (CML-AP) who have failed TKI treatments.
Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: KRT-232|DRUG: Dasatinib|DRUG: Nilotinib
Part 1: Maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/maximum administered dose (MAD) of KRT-232, DLTs will be used to establish the MTD/MAD of KRT-232 in combination with dasatinib or nilotinib, 28 Days|Part 2, Arm A and B: Major molecular response (MMR) rate, The proportion of subjects who achieved complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) or partial cytogenetic response (PCyR) according to modified ELN criteria, 6 months|Part 2, Arm C: Major hematological response (MaHR) rate, The proportion of subjects who achieved MaHR according to modified ELN criteria, 6 months
CCyR rate, The proportion of subjects who achieved CCyR or PCyR according to modified ELN criteria in Arms A and B, 12 months|MCyR rate, The proportion of subjects who achieved CCyR or PCyR according to modified ELN criteria in Arm C, 47 months|Duration of response, DOR (Kaplan-Meier estimate) defined as the time from first observation of response to progression/relapse or death, whichever comes first, 47 months|Rate of complete hematologic response (CHR), The proportion of subjects who achieve a CHR according to modified ELN criteria in Arms A and B, 47 months|Progression-free survival (PFS) in each Arm, PFS is defined as the time from the first treatment dose date to progression/relapse or death, whichever comes first, 47 months|Overall survival (OS) in each Arm, OS is defined as the time from the first treatment dose date to death from any cause, 47 months
