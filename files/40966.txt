Pediatric patients (3 to 17 years) using medical cannabis (MC) for pain, sleep, mood, behaviour, seizures, treatment of cancer, or to manage symptoms related to cancer or cancer-treatment are eligible to join this 24-month study if they have a valid MC authorization.

Following screening, eligible participants will be contacted by the study coordinator. Following informed consent, study participants will record complete outcome measures on pain, sleep, mood (anxiety, depression and positive affect), behaviour, as well as report their cannabis use and indication-specific outcomes as applicable at 3, 6, 12, and 18 weeks, as well as 6, 12, 18 and 24-months.
