Evaluation of Safety and Efficiency of Metreleptin Treatment for Patients With Multiple Symmetric Lipomatosis (MSL)
Patients (homozygous MFN2 \[gene that provides instructions to produce the Mitofusin 2 protein\] R707W) will be treated with Metreleptin, and effects on body composition, metabolic parameters and safety will be assessed over a 6 month intervention period. Additional safety will be assessed for 1 more year (up to 1.5 years total) in which adverse event data will be collected.
Lipomatosis, Multiple Symmetrical
DRUG: Metreleptin
Change in truncal adiposity, Measured using a Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan, Baseline, Week 24|Change in total adiposity, Measured using a Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan, Baseline, Week 24
In 2024, the IRB granted an amendment that allowed for continued data collection, including adverse events, up to 5 years per participant.
