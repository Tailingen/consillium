Artificial Intelligence in Functional Imaging for Individualized Treatment of Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma Patients
The two curative treatment modalities for patients with HNSCC - primary chemoradiation (CRT) or primary surgery (often combined with postoperative (C)RT) - are both associated with serious side effects for which reason further stratification, optimization and personalization of treatment is urgently needed. As novel quantitative image analyses are a promising tool for further risk stratification, the investigators training a three-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network on 18F-Fluorodesoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and clinical / histopathological data of a multicentric, retrospective cohort of 1200 patients treated with primary CRT and 800 patients treated with primary surgery at Charité and cooperation institutes in order to predict individual treatment-specific outcomes and identify patients with excellent outcome after primary CRT or primary surgery or unfavorable outcome for both. The trained algorithm of the artificial intelligence will be validated in a prospective trial to see if predicted loco-regional control and recommended treatment strategies are reliable. In total 250 curative HNSCC patients, treated with CRT or primary surgery, will be enrolled on this prospective validation trial with observational character, while biomarker, clinical and FDG-PET data are collected from these patients and follow-up visits will be concluded.
HNSCC
OTHER: Observation
Locoregional Control, Freedom from local progression within the first two years after treatment. Failure of locoregional control is defined as relapse of tumor confirmed by biopsy or if biopsy is inadequate or not feasible, consisting clear image morphology (MRI / CT / PET) during routine follow-up check-ups, 2 years
Life Quality, Collection of questionares regarding life quality before treatment and during routine follow-up check-ups after treatment regarding to the European Quality of Life Instrument (EURO-QOL), 2 years|Metastases-free survival, Freedom of Metastasis within the first two years after treatment during routine follow-up check-ups; Metastasis must be confirmed by biopsy or clear image morphology if a biopsy is not feasible (MRI / CT / PET), 2 years|Toxicity of Treatment, Collection of questionares regarding toxicity according to Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) during routine follow-up check-ups, 2 years|Progression-free Survival, alternative for Overall survival; event in PFS defined as disease progression or death, 2 years
