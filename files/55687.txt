Open-label Study of Asciminib for CML-CP or CML-AP Patients With T315I Mutation Who Are Resistant, Intolerant or Ineligible to Ponatinib.
The objective of this Phase II study is to assess the potential of asciminib in managing CML-CP or CML-AP in patient carrying the T315I mutation. The presence of this mutation introduces treatment difficulties due to the limited available options. The study seeks to collect additional data on the effectiveness and safety of asciminib for these patients. By determining the drug's capacity to manage the disease and enhance patients outcomes, the study is designed to fill the unmet medical need and potentially offer a new therapeutic path for patients at a treatment deadlock.

This study is a Phase II, multi-center, single-arm prospective, open-label study that aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral asciminib in patients with CML-CP or CML-AP with T315I mutation and after at least one tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) and are resistant, intolerant, or ineligible for treatment with ponatinib.

Patients who have not been previously treated with asciminib would be enrolled in this study. The researchers will assess the effectiveness of asciminib in these participants, as well as evaluate its safety profile. The study will consist of two phases:

* The "core phase" which aims to answer the scientific and medical objectives.
* An "extension phase" intended to provide opportunity to the participants to continue their ongoing treatment (asciminib) up to commercialization in France or decision to not commercialize asciminib for the study population (stopping development, refusal to extend marketing authorization, refusal of reimbursement).
