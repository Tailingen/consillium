A Trial to Learn if Odronextamab Combined With Lenalidomide is Safe and Works Better Than Rituximab Combined With Lenalidomide in Adult Participants With Follicular Lymphoma and Marginal Zone Lymphoma
This study is researching an experimental drug called odronextamab (referred to as study drug), in combination with lenalidomide. The study is focused on participants who have one of two types of cancer: follicular lymphoma (FL) or marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) that has come back after treatment (called "relapsed"), or did not respond to treatment (called "refractory"). FL and MZL are subtypes of Non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma (NHL).

This study will be made up of two parts (Part 1 not randomized, Part 2 randomized - controlled).

The aim of Part 1 of the study is to see how safe and tolerable the study drug is when used in combination with lenalidomide, in participants with FL or MZL, and to determine the dose of the study drug to be used in Part 2 of this study. This combination is considered "first-in-human" as it has not been tested as a combination treatment in humans before.

The aim of Part 2, of the study is to assess how the combination of the study drug and lenalidomide works compared to the combination of rituximab (called "the comparator drug") and lenalidomide. The combination of comparator drug and lenalidomide is the current standard-of care treatment for FL and/or MZL. Standard of care means the usual medication expected and used when receiving treatment for a condition.

The study is looking at several other research questions, including:

* What side effects may happen from taking the study drug in combination with lenalidomide
* How much study drug is in the blood at different times
* Whether the body makes antibodies against the study drug (which could make the study drug less effective or could lead to side effects)
* The impact from the study drug on quality of life and ability to complete routine daily activities

Odronextamab concentrations in serum, Part 1 and Part 2, Up to 30 months|Incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) to odronextamab over the study duration, Part 1 and Part 2, Up to 30 months|Titer of ADAs to odronextamab over the study duration, Part 1 and Part 2, Up to 30 months|Incidence of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) to odronextamab over the study duration, Part 1 and Part 2, Up to 30 months|Best overall response (BOR) as assessed by investigator review, Part 1 and Part 2, Up to 30 months|Duration of response (DOR) as assessed by investigator review, Part 1 and Part 2, Up to 5 years|PFS as assessed by investigator review, Part 1 and Part 2, Up to 5 years|Complete response (CR) as assessed by ICR, Part 2, Up to 30 months|BOR as assessed by ICR, Part 2, Up to 30 months|Overall survival (OS), Part 2, Up to 5 years|Event free survival (EFS) as assessed by ICR, Part 2, Up to 5 years|EFS as assessed by local investigator review, Part 2, Up to 5 years|DOR as assessed by ICR, Part 2, Up to 5 years|Time to next anti-lymphoma treatment (TTNT), Part 2, Up to 5 years|Incidence of TEAEs for odronextamab in combination with lenalidomide versus R2, Part 2, Up to 2 years|Severity of TEAEs for odronextamab in combination with lenalidomide versus R2, Part 2, Up to 2 years|Overall change in patient reported outcomes (PROs) as measured by scores of European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQC30), Part 2 The EORTC QLQ-C30 includes 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional and social functioning), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain and nausea/vomiting), a global health status (GHS)/QoL scale, and six single items (constipation, diarrhea, insomnia, shortness of breath, appetite loss and financial difficulties). For the functioning scales and global health status/QoL, scores range from 1 = "very poor" to 7 = "excellent" with higher scores indicate better functioning; for the symptom scales, scores range from 1 = "not at all" to 4 = "very much" higher scores indicate higher symptom burden., Up to 5 years|Overall change in PROs as measured by scores of Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lymphoma Subscale (FACT-LymS), Part 2 The FACT-Lym lymphoma subscale (LymS) includes 15 items to assess NHL-related symptoms and concerns. All questions are answered on a 5-point scale ranging from "not at all" (0) to "very much" (4). Higher scores are associated with a worse quality of life., Up to 5 years|Overall change in PROs as measured by scores of Patient Global Impression on Severity (PGIS), Part 2 The PGIS includes a single-item to assess how a patient perceives the overall severity of cancer symptoms over the past 7 days. Patients will choose the response that best describes the severity of their overall cancer symptoms with options on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (No symptoms) to 4 (Very Severe)., Up to 5 years|Overall change in PROs as measured by scores of Patient Global Impression on Change (PGIC), Part 2 The PGIC item includes a single-item to assess how a patient perceives their overall change in health status since the start of study treatment. Patients will choose from response options on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (Much Better) to 7 (Much worse); 1- Much Better, 2-Moderately Better, 3-A Little Better, 4-About the Same, 5-A Little Worse, 6-Moderately Worse, 7-Much Worse., Up to 5 years|Overall change in PROs as measured by scores of EuroQoL 5 Dimensions 5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L), Part 2 The EQ-5D-5L consists of the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: "no problems", "slight problems", "moderate problems", "severe problems" and "extreme problems". The EQ VAS records the participant's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale where the endpoints are labeled "Best imaginable health state" and "Worst imaginable health state"., Up to 5 years|Overall change in score of the global population item 5 (GP5) items of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) questionnaire, Part 2 A single item (GP5) of the validated FACT-G questionnaire will be used to assess from the participant perspective the overall impact of treatment side-effect.
