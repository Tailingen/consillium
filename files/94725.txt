Genetic Testing in Upper Tract Urothelial Carcinoma (UTUC): the Epicheck Study
Background:

Upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) is a rare tumor associated with bladder cancer in up to 50% of cases. Its incidence is rising due to improved detection and bladder cancer survival. The diagnosis of UTUC is challenging because more than 35% of the standard biopsies can result inconclusive. The grading of UTUC cells, which delivers the most important data for the choice between a kidney-sparing surgery (KSS) and a radical treatment, is upgraded in 30% of radical nephroureterectomies. The follow-up of UTUC after KSS requires an invasive procedure as a diagnostic ureteroscopy for a minimum of 5 years, and urinary cytology has low diagnostic power.

Objective:

The aim of the study is to evaluate the accuracy (overall and stratified for grade) of a DNA methylation urine biomarker test (Bladder EpiCheckTM) in UTUC, and to compare it with current standard (urinary cytology). The secondary objective is to show its applicability in the specific clinical scenario of UTUC surveillance after kidney-sparing surgery and related cost-effectiveness.

Design, Setting, and Participants:

From February 2019 to February 2021, 80 consecutive patients candidates to ureteroscopy for suspicion of primary, recurrent or metachronous UTUC in one tertiary Referral Centers (Fundaciò Puigvert) giving written informed consent will be included in the study.

Intervention:

Bladder urine samples (\> 10 ml) will be collected for cytology and for the methylation test before cystoscopy. Prior to semirigid and flexible ureteroscopy, urine specimens from the upper urinary tract will be obtained via a ureteral catheter.
