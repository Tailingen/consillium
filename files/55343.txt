A Multicenter, Open-label, Non-randomized Phase I/IIa Clinical Trial to Evaluate INR102 Injection in Patients With Prostate Cancer
A Phase I/IIa clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, radiation dosimetry, and preliminary efficacy of INR102 injection in patients with prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: INR102 injection
Validity Index, The proportion of subjects whose PSA decreased by â‰¥50% relative to the baseline and was confirmed by the second (next) PSA measurement after 4 weeks., 2 years after the initial study treatment
This is a Phase I/IIa, open-label, multicenter clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), radiation dosimetry, and preliminary efficacy of multiple fixed doses of INR102 in subjects with PSMA-positive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have progressed after treatment with at least one novel androgen receptor pathway inhibitor (ARPI) and taxane-based therapies. Based on the collected data, including potential dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and therapeutic doses of similar products, the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) was determined. Subsequently, a dose-expansion cohort study was conducted using RP2D to further assess the preliminary efficacy, safety, tolerability, PK profile, and radiation dosimetry characteristics of INR102 in the same patient population.
