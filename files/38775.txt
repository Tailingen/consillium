Effects of Gum Chewing on Recovery of Bowel Function Following Abdominal Surgery for Endometrial and Ovarian Cancer
Following extensive abdominal surgery for the treatment of endometrial or ovarian cancer, paralytic ileus frequently develops. Gum chewing can promotes the return of bowel function through the cephalic-vagal reflex and increased intestinal enzymes secretion.

The objectives of this study are to evaluate effects of adding gum chewing to the conventional postoperative feeding protocol on the return of bowel function, its related complications, and patients' satisfaction.
