MR/PET in the Evaluation of Patients With Esophageal Cancer
In this prospective study, we will recruit newly diagnosed esophageal cancer patients and perform MR/PET before and after chemoradiation therapy. In MR, new image sequences will be added to the conventional sequences, such as high resolution image, DWI, DCE, cine imaging.
Esophageal Cancer
DEVICE: The imaging biomarkers determined by MR-PET
The imaging biomarkers determined by MR-PET, 1 month
Total 80 patients will be recruited and followed after treatment complete for at least two years. We will compare the staging accuracy of MR/PET and PET/CT, and also analyze parameters that are predictive of disease recurrence and patient survival.
