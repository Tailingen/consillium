Home-based care includes education for patients and their family caregivers, home visits by specialized home-based medical staff, and regular status check-up. We are recruiting the study participants from 6 institutions, aiming for 396 cancer patients.

Participants for the intervention group will be recruited from Seoul National University Hospital, Chung-ang University Hospital, and Dongguk University Ilsan Hospital.
