Safety, Tolerability, and Anti-Tumor Activity of AFM24 in Combination With SNK01 in Subjects With Advanced/Metastatic EGFR-Expressing Cancers
This is an open-label, multi-center study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and anti-tumor activity of SNK01 in combination with AFM24 in subjects with advanced or metastatic EGFR-expressing cancers.

The study will be conducted in two phases. The Phase 1/dose escalation phase will gather preliminary safety and tolerability data for escalating doses of AFM24 in combination with SNK01 at a fixed dose in order to determine the MTD/RP2D for the combination dose regimen to be used in the Phase 2a/expansion.

The Phase 2a/expansion portion of the study will gather additional safety, tolerability, efficacy, and anti-tumor activity information for the combination of AFM24 with SNK01 in subjects with three types of advanced or metastatic EGFR-expressing cancers.
