Treatment Patterns, Clinical Outcomes, and Healthcare Resource Utilization Associated With Chinese Patients With Advanced Lung Cancer
The purpose of the study is to document real-world pattern of care, outcomes and health resource use for participants diagnosed with and receiving treatment for advanced Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and extensive disease Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in China.
