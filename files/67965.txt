Phase I Study of Enadenotucirev and PD-1 Inhibitor in Subjects With Metastatic or Advanced Epithelial Tumors
This is a Phase I multicenter, open label, nonrandomized study of enadenotucirev administered in combination with nivolumab in subjects with metastatic or advanced epithelial tumors (with focus on CRC, SCCHN, escalation phase), not responding to standard therapy.

Incidence, nature and severity of adverse events (safety and tolerability) in study of enadenotucirev administered in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor, Review of adverse events including serious adverse events (SAEs), adverse events meeting protocol defined DLT criteria, adverse events leading to study treatment or study discontinuation, and adverse events resulting in death, 12 months|Maximum Tolerated and/or Maximum Feasible Dose, Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) / maximum feasible dose (MFD) of enadenotucirev administered IV in combination with nivolumab., 12 months
To characterise the safety and tolerability of enadenotucirev administered in combination with nivolumab in subjects with metastatic or advanced epithelial tumours.

A dose escalation phase is conducted in subjects with solid tumors of epithelial origin not responding to standard therapy to establish the MTD/MFD and optimum dosing schedule of the enadenotucirev and nivolumab combination treatment.

A dose expansion phase will further outline the dose level and schedule of enadenotucirev and nivolumab combination treatment and investigate signals of efficacy in three cohorts of subjects with specific epithelial tumour types.
