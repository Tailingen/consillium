Using a Novel Functional MRI Technique to Evaluate for Neurotoxicity
The purpose of this study is to test resting state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rsfMRI) scans to see if rsfMRI scans are better than the standard task based fMRI scans at diagnosing or monitoring central nervous system lymphoma.
