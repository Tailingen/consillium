Use of Ribavirin and Low Dose Ara-C to Treat Acute Myeloid Leukemia
The purpose of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of ribavirin, when given in combination with low-dose ara-C and to determine if it is safe and well-tolerated in patients with acute myeloid leukemia.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Ribavirin|DRUG: Cytarabine arabinoside
Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) of Ribavirin When Given in Combination With Low-dose Ara-C, This 3+3 designed aimed to determine recommended phase II dose (RP2D) based on pharmacokinetics (PK) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD). For the dose to be selected, a target steady state level of ribavirin 20 uM was needed for all patients and no more than 1 of 6 patients could have had dose limiting toxicity at that dose., 56 days
Overall Response Rate, Overall response rate comprises complete response (\<5% blasts in the bone marrow, and in the peripheral blood Hgb more than or equal to 100 g/L, platelets more than or equal to 100x10-9/L, and neutrophils more than or equal to 1x10-9/L), partial response (5 to 25% blasts in the bone marrow and same peripheral blood parameters) and blast response (a greater than 50% decrease in bone marrow blast count and 2 log reduction in peripheral blood blast count, sustained for at least 28 days)., 2-3 years|Complete Response Rate, Defined as \<5% blasts in the bone marrow and a hgb 100 g/L, platelets 100,000/uL, neutrophils 1000/uL., 2-3 years|Partial Response, Partial response was defined as 5 to 25% blasts in the bone marrow and Hgb \>100g/L, platelets \>100,000/ul and neutrophils \>1000/ul., 2-3 years|Blast Response, Blast response was defined as a greater than 50% decrease in bone marrow blast count and 2 log reduction in peripheral blood blast count, sustained for at least 28 days., 2-3 years
Primary Objectives

In the Phase I portion of this study, we will determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of ribavirin and low-dose ara-C. The primary objective of the Phase II portion of the study is to determine the overall response rate, including the complete remission (CR), complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi), partial remission (PR) or blast response (BR), to therapy with ribavirin and low dose ara-C at the RP2D.

STUDY DESIGN AND DURATION

This is a multicentre, open-label, single arm Phase I/II study of oral ribavirin and low-dose ara-C for patients with AML M4/M5 or AML with high expression of eIF4E, who have relapsed or refractory disease, or who are not suitable candidates for induction chemotherapy. This study will determine the recommended phase II dose and will evaluate efficacy. Correlative studies will be included to assess relevant molecular targets.
