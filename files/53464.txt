Window of Opportunity Study of Pembrolizumab Alone and in Combinations in Bladder Cancer
This is an open-label, window of opportunity platform study for subjects with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) who are deemed ineligible or refuse cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy and are scheduled to undergo definitive surgery (radical cystectomy), or are planning to undergo trimodality therapy (maximal transurethral resection of the bladder tumor followed by concurrent chemoradiation).

The primary objective of this study is to assess changes to immunogenomic markers after treatment with pembrolizumab alone and in combination with the selective class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor (entinostat).
Bladder Cancer
DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Entinostat|PROCEDURE: Procedure/Surgery
Change from baseline in Z-score of T cell CD8 immune 37-gene signature, The primary objective will be assessed by the change in the T cell immune gene signature in patients treated with pembrolizumab compared to those treated with pembrolizumab plus entinostat. Gene expression for each gene included in the T cell CD8 immune 37-gene signature (Bindea et al, Immunity 2013) will be quantified based on messenger RNA sequencing (mRNAseq). For each patient in each treatment group, the change in Z-score of the T cell immune gene signature will be calculated from the post-treatment tumor biopsy (cystectomy) compared with the pre-treatment biopsy and changes in Z-scores in the two groups will be compared., Baseline and delivery of surgery sample to lab (Up to 3 months)
Change from baseline in number and character of neoantigens, Neoantigens will be predicted based on whole exome sequencing data using mRNAseq-based filtering. The number of predicted neoantigens will be calculated in the pre-treatment biopsy specimen and the post-treatment cystectomy specimen for each patient. The change from baseline in number and character of neoantigens will be described and compared for each treatment group. Similarly, the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire will be sequenced and clonality in blood and tumor will be compared between pre- and post-treatment samples for each patient, and change in clonality will be compared between treatment groups., Baseline and delivery of surgery sample to lab (Up to 3 months)|Change from baseline in Signal transducer and activator of transcription factors (STAT) and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) gene signatures and histone acetylation (H3K9Ac, H3K27Ac, and others) levels, Compare changes in STAT and NF-κB gene signatures and histone acetylation (H3K9Ac, H3K27Ac, and others) levels after combination treatment with pembrolizumab and entinostat as compared to pembrolizumab alone (subset of subjects with frozen pre- and post-treatment tumor tissue available) Gene expression for each gene in representative STAT, NF-κB, and histone acetylation gene signatures (from MSigDB) will be quantified based on mRNA sequencing. Change in Z-score of these gene signatures will be calculated from pre- and post-treatment tissue samples for patients in both cohorts (pembrolizumab alone or pembrolizumab plus entinostat), and then changes in Z-scores will be compared between cohorts., Baseline and delivery of surgery sample to lab (Up to 3 months)|Frequency and Severity by grade of Adverse Events as Assessed by CTCAE v5.0, The analysis of the toxicity and safety will be based on the frequency of adverse events and their severity, occurred day 1 of the study treatment until 30 days after completion of the study treatment. Worst toxicity grades per subject will be tabulated for adverse events and laboratory measurements by using the National Cancer Institute- Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE version 5.0) and will be reported in the form of frequency tables., 30 days after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (Up to 3 months)|Proportion of patients who have no cancer in tissue samples at surgery (pathologic Complete Response, or only non-invasive cancer (pathologic Partial Response), The proportion of patients who have a pathologic response to less than stage 2 (\<pT2) will be reported along with a 95% confidence interval. Similarly, the proportion of patients who have a complete response (pT0) will be reported., Time of surgery (Up to 3 months)|Event Free Survival (EFS), EFS is defined as day 1 of neoadjuvant/protocol treatment to date of first documentation of disease progression (or until recurrence after surgery or radiation) or death due to any cause. Recurrence includes the development of second primary muscle-invasive urothelial malignancies., Up to 3 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as day 1 of neoadjuvant/protocol treatment to date of death due to any cause. Patients will be censored at date of last follow-up., Up to 3 years
The study will enroll 20 subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of MIBC (cT2-T4aN0M0) who are planned for definitive therapy with either radical cystectomy without cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy or trimodality therapy.

Prior to study entry, subjects must consent to having tissue collected for research purposes during the scheduled cystectomy or maximal TURBT. After screening and enrollment, baseline blood and archived transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) tumor tissue will be collected from each subject for baseline analyses. Subjects will then start on clinical trial treatment followed by either radical cystectomy or maximal TURBT followed by chemoradiation.

Blood and tumor will be collected from each subject at the time of cystectomy or maximal TURBT. The investigators do not anticipate delays in surgery due to the planned schedule of the preoperative treatment administration for the purposes of this study and based on previous reported results of the trial which includes pembrolizumab and entinostat treatment in melanoma reported an acceptable safety profile. Phase I data identified grade 1/2 fatigue as the most common entinostat-related toxicity, with neutropenia and anemia only occurring at doses exceeding those proposed for this study. Safety stopping rules for drug-related toxicity will dictate whether the trial should be halted if subjects are experiencing drug-related toxicity that delays or interferes with the standard of care procedures.
