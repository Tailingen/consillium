Drainless Robot-assisted Minimally Invasive Esophagectomy
The aim of this study is the evaluation of two different chest drain management strategies in patients undergoing robot-assisted minimally invasive esophagectomy (RAMIE) for esophageal cancer with regard to perioperative complications until discharge.The primary objective of the study is to investigate whether the intensity of postoperative pain can be significantly reduced by avoiding thoracic drains after RAMIE. We assume that this will influence secondary endpoints such as early recovery and length of hospital stay.
Esophageal Cancer
PROCEDURE: Early removal of chest drain|PROCEDURE: Chest drain
Postoperative pain, Postoperative pain according to a numeric rating scale, Day 2 after surgery
Mean postoperative pain, Postoperative pain according to a numeric rating scale, Day 4 after surgery|Additional analgesic drug use, opioids \[mg\], non-opioids \[mg\], Day 4 after surgery|Postoperative mobilization, steps per day as measured with an activity tracker, Day 7 after surgery|Postoperative morbidity, The postoperative morbidity of all patients is assessed with the comprehensive complication index based on Clavien Dindo classification from postoperative day 1 until day of discharge, Through hospital stay, an average of 14 days|Postoperative mortality, The postoperative mortality of all patients is assessed between operation date and date of death of any cause during hospital stay, Through hospital stay, an average of 14 days|Daily postoperative pain, Postoperative pain according to a numeric rating scale measured daily from postoperative day 1-7, Day 7 after surgery
