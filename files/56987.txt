Anlotinib Hydrochloride Capsules Combined With TQB2450 in the Treatment of Endometrial Cancer
To demonstrate that anlotinib hydrochloride capsules combined with TQB2450 injection can significantly prolong progression-free survival (PFS) compared with chemotherapy in patients with recurrent or metastatic endometrial cancer that is non- microsatellite instability high (non-MSI-H) or DNA mismatch repair deficient (non-dMMR).
