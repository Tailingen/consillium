Diffusion Weighted MRI Enables Differential Diagnosis Between Pyocele and Mucocele
Diffusion MRI should allow for differentation of pus and simple retention in the paranasal sinuses, but this remained to be determined
Pyocele; Sinus
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: MRI
apparent diffusion coefficient, apparent diffusion coefficient on a diffusion weighted MRI sequence, 5 years
On the basis of the apparent diffusion coefficient, the content of a para nasal sinus could be defined as simple mucus or pus. This differentiation is very important for the clinician for prompt treatment. The aim of this study is to retrospectively measure this coefficient and to correlate it to clinica data.
