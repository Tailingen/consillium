Maintenance Low Dose Oral Navelbine In Patients With Non Small Cell Lung Cancer - MA.NI.LA Trial
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) represents the first cancer related cause of death worldwide with 1.4 millions of deaths every years. Current standard therapies include platinum-containing drugs but at one year from diagnosis the survival rate is still low (30-40%) .

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of a platinum-free drug, named Vinorelbine, administered by the so called "metronomic schedule" in order to prolong the progression free survival of patients.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Stage IIIB|Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Stage IV
DRUG: Vinorelbine
Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS: defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documentation of progression, or of death due to any cause, whichever comes first., Assessed at every 2 cycles (6 wks), 28d after last dose intake and, for patients discontinuing vinolbine for reason other than PD, every 6 wks during Follow Up, up to 18 mos after the enrollment of the Last Patient (LPI)
Overall Survival (OS), OS: defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause or the last date the patient was known to be alive., Assessed at every cycle (3wks), 28d after last dose intake and, during Follow Up, every 3 mos except for patients discontinuing vinolbine for reason other than PD whose assessment is every 6 wks, up to 18 mos after LPI|Objective Tumor Response Rate (ORR, CR+PR), ORR, CR+PR: defined as the proportion of patients with measurable disease at baseline achieving partial or complete overall best response according to RECIST version 1.1 criteria., Assessed at every 2 cycles (6wks), 28d after last dose intake and, during Follow Up, every 3 mos except for patients discontinuing vinolbine for reason other than PD whose assessment is every 6 wks, up to 18 mos after LPI|Duration of Response (only in patients in CR or PR), Duration of Response (only in patients in CR or PR): defined as the time from the date of the first documentation of confirmed objective tumor response to the date of first documentation of objective tumor progression, objective tumor recurrence, or of death due to progressive disease, whichever comes first., Assessed every two cycles (6wks), 28d after last dose intake and, during Follow Up, every 3 mos except for patients discontinuing vinolbine for reason other than PD whose assessment is every 6 wks, up to 18 mos after LPI|Duration of Post Progression Survival, Duration of Post Progression Survival: defined as the time from the date of first documentation of objective tumor progression to the date of death from any cause or the last date the patient was known to be alive., Assessed at 28d after last dose intake and, during Follow Up, every 3 mos except for patients discontinuing vinolbine for reason other than PD whose assessment is every 6 wks, up to 18 mos after LPI|Quality of Life (QoL) according to EORTC QLC30, EORTC QOL-LC13, Assessed at every 2 cycles (6wks), 28d after last dose intake and, for patients discontinuing vinolbine for reason other than PD, every 6 wks during Follow Up, up to 18 mos after LPI|Overall Safety Profile, Overall Safety Profile, characterized by type, frequency, severity \[graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 4.0\], timing and relationship to study therapy of adverse events and laboratory abnormalities., Assessed at every cycle (3wks) and 28d after last dose intake up to 18 months after LPI
Systemic therapy remains the mainstay of treatment of advanced stage NSCLC. Combination chemotherapy with a platinum-based regimen has emerged as standard therapy for patients with advanced stage disease. Observations supported by the findings of several clinical trial, established the notion that an efficacy plateau had been reached in advanced stage NSCLC patients treated with platinum-containing drugs.

Recent phase III trials suggest the benefit of "switch" and "continuing" maintenance treatment with different drugs. As "switched therapy", Vinorelbine has been selected on the base of its anti-mitotic role. In fact, the use of anti-mitotic drugs at lower dose but with higher frequency (metronomic schedule) seems to augment the anti-angiogenetic effect of this kind of drugs, thus augmenting the efficacy of the therapy.

Therefore, the purpose of the current study is to evaluate the role of a "switched maintenance" with oral vinorelbine administered as a metronomic schedule in terms of Progression Free Survival (PFS) in advanced NSCLC patients with stable disease after first line platinum based chemotherapy.
