Blinatumomab Consolidation Post Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation in Patients With Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)
Based on the further need to improve progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) post autologous stem cell transplant (SCT) for DLBCL, the hematopoietic profile of patients following auto-SCT, the activity of blinatumomab in DLBCL and its favorable toxicity profile, the investigators propose a pilot study to test blinatumomab as consolidation therapy post auto-SCT for patients with DLBCL.

The investigators hypothesize the blinatumomab consolidation will optimize the effector to target (E-T) ratio and aid in the eradication of remaining tumor cells, leading to decreased relapse and increased overall survival. In addition, since tumor burden will be at a minimum, infusional toxicities including neurologic toxicities may also be limited. The purpose of this pilot study is to study the feasibility and tolerability of blinatumomab consolidation post auto-SCT for patients with chemo-sensitive DLBCL undergoing auto-SCT.
Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Blinatumomab|PROCEDURE: Autologous stem cell transplant|DRUG: Carmustine|DRUG: Etoposide|DRUG: Cytarabine|DRUG: Melphalan|PROCEDURE: Peripheral blood draws
Feasibility and tolerability of blinatumomab consolidation post auto-SCT as measured by percentage of patients who can finish a full course of blinatumomab post-auto-SCT, -The primary endpoint is calculated by the proportion of patients who complete a full course of blinatumomab to the total number of patients started blinatumomab after auto-SCT., Up to Day 70
Progression-free survival (PFS), -PFS is defined as from the date of Day 0 to date of progression or death, which occurs first. They are censored at the last follow-up otherwise., 1 year post-auto-SCT|Progression-free survival (PFS), -PFS is defined as from the date of Day 0 to date of progression or death, which occurs first. They are censored at the last follow-up otherwise., 3 years post-auto-SCT|Overall survival, -OS is defined as from the date of Day 0 to date of death. They are censored at the last follow-up otherwise., 1 year post-auto-SCT|Overall survival, -OS is defined as from the date of Day 0 to date of death. They are censored at the last follow-up otherwise., 3 years post-auto-SCT|Complete remission rate in patients with residual disease after auto-SCT, -Complete remission=disappearance of all evidence of disease, Up to Day 100
