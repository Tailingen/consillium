GB1275 Monotherapy and in Combination With an Anti-PD1 Antibody in Patients With Specified Advanced Solid Tumors or in Combination With Standard of Care in Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
This first-in-human (FIH ) study is an open-label, multicenter study that consists of a Phase 1 Dose Escalation/Expansion phase of GB1275 monotherapy or in combination with Anti-PD-1 Antibody or in combination with Standard of Care in Patients with Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma followed by a Phase 2 Basket Expansion phase in Patients with Specified Metastatic Solid Tumors
