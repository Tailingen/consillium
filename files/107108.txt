Are CK+/CD45+ Double-Positive Circulating Cells of Tumor-origin? Characterization in METAstatic Breast Cancer
A prospective, single-centre, proof-of-concept pilot study in patients with metastatic breast cancers (MBC) (whatever the immunohistochemical subtype) treated at the IUCT-O. Eligible patients will be selected and informed of this study during a medical consultation for cancer that has metastasised, has relapsed or is progressing metastatically, by medical oncologists at the Oncopole Claudius Regaud (OCR). Then, with the patient's agreement and before the start of anti-tumour treatment, a blood sample will be taken to detect DP-circulating cells. A breast cancer tumour sample (non-bone metastasis or, failing that, primary tumour) must be available (FFPE archived tumour block).

Each patient will participate in the study for one day.

60 patients will be included in this interventional study.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
OTHER: For each patient included, the samples described below will be collected:
Rate of patients with proven tumour origin of DP-circulating cells. This is defined as the number of patients with proven tumour origin of DP-circulating cells out of the number of patients with DP-circulating cells., Approximately 16 months after the start of the study
The presence and number of DP-circulating cells and conventional circulating tumor cells (CTCs)., The heterogeneity of DP-circulating cells will be estimated by the penetrance of genomic alterations in a given patient, which will give us information on the sub-clonality of the alteration (shared by x percent of cells), but also by single cell DNA sequencing (scDNAseq)., Approximately 16 months after the start of the study
