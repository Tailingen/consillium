Physical Capacity in Hodgkin Lymphoma Survivors
The study aims to investigate if physical capacity obtained in the cardiopulmonary exercise test can predict cardiovascular alterations in Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) Survivors. In addition, to study the effects of exercise training on physical capacity and cardiovascular responses in these patients.

Physical Capacity - Peak oxygen consumption (mL/kg/min), Oxygen consuption in crescent effort will be calculated by aggregation of volume (mL), body weight (Kg) and time (minutes)., 4 months
Heart Hate (beat/min), Post-exercise heart rate will be evaluated by the number of beats in time masurement (one minute)., 4 months|Cardiac Function - Ejection Fraction, Ejection Fraction (EF=ESV-EDV/EDV) combines end systolic (ESV) and diastolic volumes (EDV)(mL), 4 months
Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) is a hematological neoplasia that mainly affects young people. Anthracycline-based chemotherapy, followed or not by mediastinal radiotherapy, substantially improves prognosis in this set of patients. Observational studies have shown that cardiovascular disease is the most non oncologic cause of death in this population. Coronary artery disease (CAD) affects 26% of survivors after 10 years of absence of HL . However, the early intervention and the assessment to predict the cardiovascular risk remain little known. In this study, the investigators will test the hypothesis that physical capacity can predict the cardiovascular alterations in HL Survivors. In addition, exercise training improves physical capacity and heart rate responses in this set of patients.
