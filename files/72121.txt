Percutaneous Microwave Ablation Under Ultrasound Guidance for Liver Cancer: a Multicenter Analysis
Ultrasound-guided percutaneous MWA of liver cancer is a relatively new technique with favorable long-term outcomes.Butthe results are mainly from single center reports.A larger scale data need to be analyzed to evaluate the technique. This study is designed to investigated the efficacy of cooled-tip microwave ablation (MWA) for primary liver cancer (PLC) and analyzed the prognostic factors on a multicenter database.Between January 2013 and December 2018, all the PLC patients underwent ultrasound-guided percutaneous cooled-tip MWA as a primary treatment will be enrolled from at least ten Chinese institutions with different levels of MWA experience. All the patients will be closely followed up until June 2019. Clinicopathologic data, recurrence and survival estimates, complications and prognosis-relative factors will be measured.
