I-MVAC +/- Panitumumab as First-line Treatment of Advanced Urothelial Carcinoma Without H-Ras Nor K-Ras Mutations
OBJECTIVES OF THE TRIAL

Primary objective

Evaluation of efficacy in terms of progression-free survival at 9 months of the combination of intensified methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin and cisplatin with or without panitumumab as first-line treatment of advanced urothelial carcinoma in patients without Harvey nor Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog mutations.

Secondary objectives

* To assess toxicity
* To assess response rate
* To assess overall survival
* To assess time to progression
* To study the correlation between response rate, time to progression, overall survival and biological parameters
