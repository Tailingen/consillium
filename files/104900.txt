Combination of TST001, Nivolumab and Chemotherapy as First-line Therapy in Advanced or Metastatic GC/GEJ Adenocarcinoma
Gastric/GEJ adenocarcinomas are aggressive tumors with a high probability of death. Current treatment guidelines include two-drug cytotoxic chemotherapy with a fluoropyrimidine (mFOLFOX6: capecitabine or fluorouracil) and a platinum-based agent (CapOx: oxaliplatin or cisplatin). In addition, the FDA has recently approved nivolumab, a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor, in combination with chemotherapy as first line treatment for advanced or metastatic gastric/GEJ cancer. TST001 is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody against Claudin (a tumor marker found in gastric/GEJ cancer. In this study, the combination therapy of chemotherapy or chemotherapy and nivolumab with and without TST001 (a novel recombinant humanized antibody) could provide additional benefits to the management of these tumors.

Progression free survival (PFS) based on RECIST (1.1), Compare PFS of patients treated with TST001 or Placebo in addition to CapOx or mFOLFOX6 and nivolumab or CapOx or mFOLFOX6, From date of randomization until the date of documented progression, assessed up to 100 days after last dose
Overall Survival (OS) based on RESIST (log-rank test), Compare OS of patients treated with TST001 or Placebo in addition to CapOx or mFOLFOX6 and nivolumab or CapOx or mFOLFOX6, rom date of randomization until the date of documented progression, assessed up to 100 days after last dose|Overall Response Rate (ORR) based on RESIST progressive disease (log-rank test), Compare complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) between treatment arms of patients treated with TST001 or Placebo in addition to CapOx or mFOLFOX6 and nivolumab or CapOx or mFOLFOX6., From date of randomization until the date of documented CR or PR assessed up to 100 days after last dose|Quality of Life (QOL) assessed on EuroQol EQ5D-5L, Change in QOL assessments from baseline of patients treated with TST001 or Placebo in addition to mFOLFOX6 and nivolumab or CapOx or mFOLFOX6. Assessments include Cancer QOL questionnaires (QLC-STO22, EQ5D-5L, and QLQ-C30), From date of randomization until the date of documented progression, assessed up to 100 days after last dose|Disease Control Rate (DCR) based on RESIST assessed as the percentage of subjects with measurable disease, Compare complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) between treatment arms of patients treated with TST001 or Placebo in addition to CapOx or mFOLFOX6 and nivolumab or CapOx or mFOLFOX6., From date of randomization until the date of documented progression, assessed up to 100 days after last dose|Duration of Response (DOR) based on RESIST (log-rank test), Compare duration of response between treatment arms of patients treated with TST001 or Placebo in addition to CapOx or mFOLFOX6 and nivolumab or CapOx or mFOLFOX6., From date of randomization until the date of documented progression, assessed up to 100 days after last dose|Time to Response (TTR) of progression based on RESIST, Compare the time of response between treatment arms of patients treated with TST001 or Placebo in addition to CapOx or mFOLFOX6 and nivolumab or CapOx or mFOLFOX6 based on CR or PR., From date of randomization until the date of documented progression, assessed up to 100 days after last dose
This Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TST001 in combination with nivolumab and chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone in subjects with tumors that express markers (HER2 negative, Claudin18.2 positive, known PD-L1 CPS status) in locally advanced or metastatic gastric/GEJ adenocarcinoma. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ration to receive TST001 or placebo in combination with nivolumab and chemotherapy or with chemotherapy alone.
