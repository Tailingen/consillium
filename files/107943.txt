Atu027 Plus Gemcitabine in Advanced or Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer (Atu027-I-02)
The purpose of the study is to evaluate a new treatment strategy for advanced pancreatic cancer disease by combining the new investigational medicinal product Atu027 with the standard chemotherapeutic gemcitabine. This combination aims at enhancing gemcitabine´s anti-tumor activity with Atu027.

The objectives of this clinical trial are to evaluate safety and activity of two Atu027 schedules in combination with standard gemcitabine treatment in patients with advanced or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal
DRUG: Atu027 & gemcitabine in lead in safety period|DRUG: Atu027 & gemcitabine in treatment arm 1|DRUG: Atu027 & gemcitabine in treatment arm 2
Number of subjects with adverse events, Time frame will be 18 weeks if patient will be withdrawn after 3 cycles because of disease progression or toxicity., Baseline till follow up visit 1 (18 weeks)|Subject physical examination, Additional time frames in arm 1: 8 days after baseline. Additional time frames in arm 2 and safety cohort (cycle 1 only): 4 and 15 days after baseline., At baseline; later on in 4 week intervals till last follow up visit (1 year);|Measuring of subject vital signs and body weight, End of treatment visit will be after 13 weeks only when patient is withdrawn after 3 cycles.

Additional time frames in arm 1: 8 days after baseline. Additional time frames in arm 2 and safety cohort (cycle 1 only): 4 and 15 days after baseline., At baseline; end of treatment (13 weeks); later on in 4 week intervals till last follow up visit (1 year)|Performance of 12-lead ECG, End of treatment visit will be after 13 weeks only when patient is withdrawn after 3 cycles.

Additional time frames in arm 1: 8 days after baseline. Additional time frames in arm 2 and safety cohort (cycle 1 only): 4 and 15 days after baseline., At baseline; later on in 4 week intervals till end of treatment (13 weeks)|Assessment of clinically significant laboratory parameters outside normal range, Additional time frames in arm 1: During treatment on days 1, 8, 15 of each cycle.

Additional time frames in arm 2 and safety cohort (cycle 1 only): During treatment on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22, 25 of each cycle., At baseline; at end of treatment (week 13 if patient withdrawn after 3 cycles); at follow up visit 1 (week 18 if patient withdrawn after 3 cycles); at each follow up visit till end of trial (1 year)|Maximum concentration (Cmax), area under the curve (AUC), time to maximum concentration (tmax), and half life (t½) of the Atu027 siRNA single strand (A-strand), and of AtuFect01 and the helper lipid DPyPE, Additional time frames in arm 1: During cycles 1 and 2 of treatment on days 1, 8, 15 of each cycle; in cycle 3 and following only on day 1; Additional time frames in arm 2 and safety cohort (cycle 1 only): During the first treatment cycle on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18; in cycle 3 and following odd numbered cycles only on day 1; in all even numbered cycles no samples are taken.

Pharmacokinetics will be assessed in subjects of the safety cohort and in the first 4 subjects per treatment arm., At end of treatment (week 13 if patient withdrawn after 3 cycles); at follow up visit 1 (week 18 if patient withdrawn after 3 cycles)
Objective response rate, Response will be assessed by RECIST Version 1.1 using abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scans.

An objective response is defined when the overall response is complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD)., At baseline and in 8 week intervals till end of trial (1 year)|Progression-free survival and overall survival, Progression-free survival and overall survival, based on the objective response definition will be analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methods., From baseline in 8 week intervals till end of trial (1 year).|ECOG performance score, Additional time frames: During treatment on day 1 of each cycle.

The ECOG performance status, and its change from baseline, will be summarized descriptively by visit and treatment arm. The ECOG performance status will also be assessed during the 1 year follow-up period of the study and results including changes to baseline will be summarized., At baseline; at end of treatment (13 weeks if patient withdrawn after 3 cycles); at follow up visit 1 (18 weeks if patient withdrawn after 3 cycles); at each following follow up visit till end of trial (1 year)|Biomarker response, Serum protein markers and circulating microRNA will be analyzed and changes to baseline will be summarized descriptively by treatment arm., At baseline; at day 1 of cycle 3; end of treatment (13 weeks if patient withdrawn after 3 cycles); follow up visit 1 (18 weeks if patient withdrawn after 3 cycles)|Tumor marker response, Additional time frame: At day 1 of cycle 3 and day 1 of each following second cycle; Tumor markers will be summarized descriptively for each analyzed marker., At baseline; at end of treatment (13 weeks if patient withdrawn after 3 cycles); at follow up visit 1 (18 weeks if patient withdrawn after 3 cycles); at each following follow up visit till end of trial (1 year)|Quality of life, Different scales of quality of life assessed with the EORTC questionnaire and their changes from baseline will be summarized descriptively by visit and treatment arm., At baseline; at day 1 of all cycles except cycle 1; at end of treatment (week 13 if patient withdrawn after 3 cycles)
