OTHER: Questionnaires
Evaluation of sexual activity, Questionnaire SAQ : Sexual Activity Questionnaire, contains 21 items divided into three parts: the first part allows to know if a woman is sexually active or not, the second part allows to define the reasons for this activity or its absence. The third part of the questionnaire filled out by sexually active women aims to explore the pleasure generated by sex (desire, satisfaction, frequency), discomfort during intercourse, especially due to vaginal dryness and pain as well as the habits of the patient before the illness., 3 months after the end of therapeutic treatment (not the object of the study)
The representations associated with sexuality and cancer seem antinomic: wellbeing / death, and yet combine in the experience of cancer. The latter has an impact on sexuality in terms of satisfaction or sexual activity and on the relationship in terms of support.

In addition, various studies show the psychological impact of treatments on the couple's relationship or the body image of women with cancer. Their abilities to seduce are affected and explain the decrease of their sexual activity during the treatments: a communication, valuing the femininity, would it then facilitate the relations of couple? There is no work that considers sexuality in a systematic way (sexual act and verbal and non-verbal communication) and apprehends its link with the evolution of the relationship, from the diagnosis of cancer to the end of treatments.
