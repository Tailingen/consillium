A Companion Study for Studies THAL-MM-003, CC-5013-MM-009, and CC-5013-MM-010 for Subjects With Multiple Myeloma
The study evaluated the safety of Lenalidomide monotherapy in participants with advanced multiple myeloma who had discontinued treatment with combination thalidomide plus high-dose dexamethasone or high-dose dexamethasone alone in studies Thal-MM-003, CC-5013-MM-009 and CC-5013-MM-010 due to the development of documented disease progression or the inability to tolerate the lowest dosing regimen per previous protocol of thalidomide and/or high-dose dexamethasone without grade 3 or 4 toxicity.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: CC-5013|DRUG: Lenalidomide
Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AE) During the Treatment Phase, An AE is any sign, symptom, illness, or diagnosis (either observed or volunteered) that appears or worsens during the course of the study Serious adverse event (SAE) = any AE which results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; constitutes an important medical event. A treatment emergent AE is defined as any AE occurring or worsening on or after the first dose of study drug and within 30 days after the last dose of study drug. Safety and severity was assessed according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 2.0; Severity of AEs were graded (including second primary malignancies) as Grade 1- Mild; Grade 2- Moderate; Grade 3- Severe; Grade 4- Life-threatening; Grade 5-Fatal;, Until data cut-off of 22 Oct 2009; AEs/SAEs were recorded from informed consent to 30 days post treatment discontinuation visit. Maximum exposure to Lenalidomide treatment was 1260 days.|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AE) During the Extension Phase, An AE is any sign, symptom, illness, or diagnosis (either observed or volunteered) that appears or worsens during the course of the study Serious adverse event (SAE) = any AE which results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; constitutes an important medical event.

Time to Progression, Time to progression based on the myeloma response determination criteria developed by Bladé et al 1998 and is defined as the time from registration to the first documented progression. The progressive disease criteria included increasing monoclonal paraprotein levels, bone marrow findings, worsening lytic bone disease, progressively enlarging extramedullary plasmacytomas, or hypercalcemia., Up to 70 months|Myeloma Response Rate, Myeloma response determination criteria developed by Bladé et al 1998. Complete Response (CR):Disappearance of monoclonal paraprotein. Remission Response (RR):75-99% reduction in monoclonal paraprotein/90-99% reduction in 24-hr urinary light chain excretion. Partial Response (PR):50-74% reduction in monoclonal paraprotein/50-89% reduction in 24-hr urinary light chain excretion. Stable Disease (SD):Criteria for PR or PD not met. Plateau Phase:If PR, stable monoclonal paraprotein (within 25% above or below nadir)/stable soft tissue plasmacytomas. Progressive Disease (PD):Disease worsens., Up to 70 months|Duration of Response, Duration of response based on the Myeloma response determination criteria developed by Bladé et al 1998 and defined as time from the initial documented response (partial response or better) to confirmed disease progression, based on International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria., Up to 70 months
