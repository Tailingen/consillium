Impact of Environmental Exposures on Tumor Risk in SDHx-mutation Carriers
The primary objective of the PGL.EXPO-2 study is to test the hypothesis that exposure (occupational, environmental and/or domestic) to succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors (SDHi) could contribute to tumor emergence in subjects carrying a germline mutation in one of the SDHx genes.The primary endpoint will be the proportion of subjects (cases or controls) exposed to SDHi and the association with paraganglioma risk.

In addition, a blood sample (10 ml on EDTA) will be proposed to the participants to the study
SDH-Related Familial Paraganglioma|SDHx-Related Syndromes|SDH Gene Mutation|Environmental Exposure
Impact of SDHi exposure in paraganglioma occurence, Association between exposures and tumor occurrence measure with Odd ratio, 36 months
Spatial distribution of cases, Spatial distribution of tumor incidence, 48 months|Incidence rate in France of pathologies linked to SDHx gene mutations, Incidence rate in France of pathologies linked to SDHx gene mutations, 48 months
Patients will be selected from subjects with a mutation in one of the SDHx genes. The cases will have developed a tumor, while the controls will be tumor-free. Controls will be matched to the cases according to age and type of gene affected. Past exposures will be sought through a telephone questionnaire.

In addition, a blood sample (10 ml on EDTA) will be proposed to the participants to the study
