Observation of Treatment With Certolizumab Pegol in Daily Practice
This is an observational, non-interventional, non-comparative, post-authorization safety study to evaluate efficacy and long-term safety of Cimzia in adult patients with RA in need of treatment with a biological product.
Rheumatoid Arthritis
Clinical Remission at Visit 9 (Around Week 104) Measured by Achieving a Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) of < 2.6, The DAS28 was calculated using the tender and swollen joint counts, c-reactive Protein (CRP), or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and the Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (PtGADA). The joint assessment was carried out on 28 joints.

For the analysis, DAS28 values were categorized into the following groups:

* DAS28 \< 2.6: clinical remission
* DAS28 from 2.6 to â‰¤ 3.2: low disease activity
* DAS28 from \> 3.2 to 5.1: moderate disease activity
* DAS28 \> 5.1: high disease activity, From Baseline to Visit 9 (around Week 104)
Change From Baseline to Visit 9 (Around Week 104) in Patients's Arthritis Pain as Measured by Patient's Assessment of Arthritis Pain (PAAP) Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Patients rated how much pain they were experiencing at the time of the visit caused by their Arthritis using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) ranging from 0 (no pain) to 100 (most severe pain). A negative value in Change from Baseline indicates an improvement from Baseline to Visit 9 (around Week 104)., From Baseline to Visit 9 (around Week 104)|Change From Baseline to Visit 9 (Around Week 104) in Patient's Physical Function as Measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI), The HAQ-DI contains 20 items on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (without any difficulty) to 3 (unable to do). The 20 items are grouped in 8 categories with 2 to 3 items each. The category scores are averaged into an overall HAQ-DI from 0 to 3. Scores of 0 to 1 generally represent mild to moderate difficulty, 1 to 2 represent moderate to severe disability, and 2 to 3 indicate severe to very severe disability. A negative value in Change from Baseline indicates an improvement from Baseline to Visit 9 (around Week 104)., From Baseline to Visit 9 (around Week 104)|Change From Baseline to Visit 9 (Around Week 104) in Disease Activity Measured by Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI), The CDAI was calculated with the equation:

CDAI= Tender Joint Count + Swollen Joint Count + PtGADA/10 + PhGADA/10 where PtGADA (mm) is the Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) ranging from 0 to 100, and PhGADA (mm) is the Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity using a VAS ranging from 0 to 100. Thus, the CDAI ranges from 0 to 76, with higher values indicating higher disease activity. If any individual term was missing, then the CDAI was set to missing. A negative value in Change from Baseline indicates an improvement from Baseline to Visit 9 (around Week 104)., From Baseline to Visit 9 (around Week 104)
The purpose of this study is to assess the clinical efficacy of Cimzia in achieving clinical remission after two years of therapy. The observational nature of the study leaves the therapeutic decision exclusively within the discretion of the treating physician.
