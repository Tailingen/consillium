Detection of Circulating Osteosarcoma Tumor Cells in the Blood of Patients Using the Polymerase Chain Reaction
This study focusses on finding out if osteosarcoma can be detected in blood. The cells will be measured by a new laboratory technique called the polymerase chain reaction. This new technique can identify one tumor cell among one million normal cells. Using this technique Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center research doctors may be able to detect tumor cells that could not be identified any other way. This test will be in addition to cancer treatment and will not replace any other test used normally. As this technique is still unproved the results will not be given to patients or patient's doctors and will not be used to change cancer treatment.
Osteosarcoma
OTHER: Blood draw
To determine if circulating osteosarcoma cells can be reliably detected and quantitated in the blood of patients with localized and advanced osteosarcoma., conclusion of the study
To determine the frequency circulating osteosarcoma cells can be detected in the blood of patients at diagnosis, during therapy, at the completion of all planned therapy and at relapse., conclusion of the study|To determine if the presence of circulating osteosarcoma tumor cells is associated with patient outcome., conclusion of the study
