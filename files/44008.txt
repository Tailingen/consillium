Recent studies have suggested that local destruction of tumor tissue by cryoablation induced activation and maturation of dendritic cells and tumor-specific T cells by cross-presentation of tumor antigens. While pd-1 blocking antibody interferes with PD-1 mediated T-cell regulatory signaling. Therefore, the objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cryoablation combined with anti-pd-1 antibody in patients in advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.
