Metabolic Imaging Predict Histopathologic Response to Preop ChemoXRT for Locally Advanced Rectal CA
In this research study of metabolic imaging in locally advanced rectal cancer, we hope to learn whether new medical imaging technology can help predict the response of rectal cancer to preoperative chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Ultimately we hope this information will in the future help us predict which patients will benefit from more or less aggressive initial therapy for their rectal cancer.
