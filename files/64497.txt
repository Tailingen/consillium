Identification of Secreted Markers for Tumor Hypoxia in Patients With Head and Neck or Lung Cancers
The purpose of this study is to identify and confirm new blood and tissue markers for prognosis and tumor hypoxia. Tumor hypoxia, or the condition of low oxygen in the tumor, has been shown to increase the risk of tumor spread and enhance tumor resistance to the standard treatment of radiation and chemotherapy in head and neck and lung cancers. We have recently identified several proteins or markers in the blood and in tumors (including osteopontin, lysyl oxidase, macrophage inhibiting factor and proteomic technology) in the laboratory that may be able to identify tumors with low oxygen levels or more aggressive behaving tumors.

PROCEDURE: Tumor biopsy|PROCEDURE: Phlebotomy
Identification of Secreted Markers for Tumor Hypoxia through tissue collection, before therapy, weekly during therapy
The endpoints of the study are

1. To validate the prognostic significance of OPN in H\&N and lung cancer patients and to monitor its level during active therapy and follow up for cancer surveillance.
2. To identify a gene and protein signature for hypoxia in H\&N and lung cancer patients.
