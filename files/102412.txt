Analysis of Patterns of Recurrence in Head and Neck Cancer Using Clinicopathomic Markers
Here, the investigators will develop a clinicopathomic assay from biomarkers obtained from digital pathologies of resected whole-mount oral cavity and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC and OPSCC) specimens with the goal of administering personalized novel image-guided therapies immediately after primary surgical management in OCSCC and OPSCC patients. The primary aim is to determine the association between clinicopathomic biomarkers and LRR. The secondary aim is to develop a clinicopathomic risk score (assay) such that a decision-support tool can be used by physicians for measuring the benefit of additional therapies (i.e. conventional chemotherapy +/- radiation or administering dose-escalated chemoradiation) in the adjuvant setting to reduce LRR rates.
Head and Neck Neoplasm|Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Radiomic, pathomic, and clinical markers
Time to locoregional recurrence, Evaluating the time until a recurrence event has occurred in the oral cavity or oropharyngeal region, Up to 60 months
Time to distant metastasis, Evaluating onset of distant metastasis, Up to 60 months|Time to death, Evaluating time to cancer-related death, Up to 60 months
The proposed study is significant for developing personalized treatments. The proposed research will yield high rewards to patients by providing additional information to clinicians for better prognostication and potentially adapting adjuvant treatments to improve the survival of patients with OCSCC or OPSCC.
