Neo-adjuvant Transarterial Chemoinfusion (TAI) for Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma Beyond Milan/UCSF Criteria Who Underwent Liver Transplantation
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second commonest cause of cancer death worldwide. Liver transplantation (LT) is the best curative treatment of HCC meeting Milan/UCSF criteria. Milan (solitary tumour \<5cm, or up to 3 tumours, each \<3cm) and University of California San Francisco (UCSF) criteria (solitary tumour ≤6.5cm, up to 3 tumours with none \>4.5cm, and total tumour diameter ≤8cm) provide the benchmark requirements for LT, at which a 5-year survival of \>70% and recurrence rate ranging from 5-15% can be achieved.

Recently, FOLFOX (Oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil) based hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) exhibited high response rate for advanced HCC. Neo-adjuvant TAI for the HCC patients with beyond criteria serving as a down-staging method for the advanced HCC to meet Milan/UCSF criteria，and qualify for LT.

This study is to compare the impact on survival of neo-adjuvant TAI for patients with beyond Milan/UCSF Criteria HCC who underwent LT.
