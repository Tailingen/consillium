Investigator-initiated Pilot Study to Investigate the Efficacy and Safety of Immuncell-LC in Combination With Nivolumab (Opdivo) in Subjects With Advanced or Recurrent Gastric Cancer
This study was planned to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination therapy of Immuncell-LC and nivolumab in patients with relapsed or advanced gastric adenocarcinoma or gastro-esophageal junction cancer.
Relapsed or Advanced Gastric Adenocarcinoma|Gastro-esophageal Junction Cancer
DRUG: autologous activated T lymphocyte
Objective response rate (ORR) based on RECIST v1.1, ORR is defined as the number of subjects with a best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) and expressed as a percentage of all treated participants., Until disease progression, withdrawn, or initiation of subsequent chemotherapy (Up to approximately 12 months after Last Patient In)
Overall survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause., Until death, follow-up failure or study discontinuation (Up to approximately 12 months after Last Patient In)|Progression-free survival (PFS) based on RECIST v1.1, PFS is defined as the time from the date of enrollment day to the first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Responses are according to RECIST 1.1, Until disease progression, withdrawn, or initiation of subsequent chemotherapy (Up to approximately 12 months from the date the last subject was administered)|Duration of response (DOR) based on RECIST v1.1, DOR is defined as the time from the earliest date of qualifying response (CR or PR) until earliest date of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever comes first. Responses are according to RECIST 1.1, Until disease progression, withdrawn, or initiation of subsequent chemotherapy (Up to approximately 12 months from the date the last subject was administered)|Disease control rate (DCR) based on RECIST v1.1, DCR is defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who have CR (disappearance of all lesions), PR (≥30% decrease in the SOD of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters), or stable disease (SD: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD). Responses are according to RECIST 1.1, Until disease progression, withdrawn, or initiation of subsequent chemotherapy (Up to approximately 12 months from the date the last subject was administered)|ORR based on iRECIST, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who have a best response of Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or Partial Response (PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters \[SOD\] of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters). Responses are according to iRECIST, Until disease progression, withdrawn, or initiation of subsequent chemotherapy (Up to approximately 12 months from the date the last subject was administered)|PFS based on iRECIST, PFS is defined as the time from the date of enrollment day to the first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Responses are according to iRECIST, Until disease progression, withdrawn, or initiation of subsequent chemotherapy (Up to approximately 12 months from the date the last subject was administered)|DOR based on iRECIST, DOR is defined as the time from the earliest date of qualifying response (CR or PR) until earliest date of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever comes first. Responses are according to iRECIST, Until disease progression, withdrawn, or initiation of subsequent chemotherapy (Up to approximately 12 months from the date the last subject was administered)|DCR based on iRECIST, DCR is defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who have CR (disappearance of all lesions), PR (≥30% decrease in the SOD of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters), or stable disease (SD: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD). Responses are according to iRECIST, Until disease progression, withdrawn, or initiation of subsequent chemotherapy (Up to approximately 12 months from the date the last subject was administered)|Quality of life (QoL) assessment using the EORTC QLQ-STO22, EORTC STO-22 (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer - Quality of Life Questionnaire Gastric Module (STO = stomach) (22 items), comprising five multi-item and four single-item subscales. The multi-item subscales include questions about dysphagia (4 items), dietary restriction (5 items), pain (3 items), upper gastro-esophageal symptoms such as reflux (3 items), and emotional problems such as anxiety (3 items). The single-item subscales include questions related to four gastric cancer-specific symptoms: dry mouth, body image, hair loss, and problems with taste. Items are assessed on a 4-level numerical scale with 1= "not at all", 2= "a little", 3= "quite a bit", and 4= "very much". Scores are linearly converted and summated into a scaled score from 0 to 100, with a higher score representing a worse QOL., Until end of treatment (Up to approximately 12 months from the date the last subject was administered)
