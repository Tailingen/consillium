This study will enroll participants with advanced pancreatic cancer patients with KRAS G12V mutation. The study consists of screening period, leukapheresis period, lymphodepletion period, treatment period, observation period and follow-up period. A total of 9-12 evaluable patients are planned to be recruited. The study is planned to be conducted using the "3 + 3" dose escalation design in two dose groups, and a single dose of the study drug will be administered at the dose levels of 3 × 10\^9 ± 30% cells and 1 × 10\^10 ± 30% cells. Subjects will be enrolled sequentially and treated by IX001 TCR-T injection at the corresponding planned dose level. All subjects who have received IX001 TCR-T injection will be followed for safety and efficacy up to 2 years.
