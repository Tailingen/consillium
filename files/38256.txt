18F-FLUC-CEST PET/MR in Patients With Brain Mets
The goal of this clinical trial is to use new imaging methods to help in finding out whether the imaging shows that there is a tumor in people with a brain metastasis. The main question it aims to answer is whether positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) find cancerous tissue better than other types of imagining.

Participants will undergo a single PET/MRI scan, followed by a separate MRI scan with a tracer. Study participation will last about 3 hours.

Amino acid uptake into tumor tissue, Using 18F-Fluciclovine PET, compare amino acid uptake into brain tumor tissue with uptake in normal brain tissue. Higher uptake is hypothesized to indicate malignancy, 3 hours|Cystolic protein in tumor cells, Using MR CEST, measure the level of cystolic protein in tumor cells relative to normal brain tissue. Higher levels are hypothesized to indicate malignancy., 3 hours
The purpose of this research is to utilize new imaging methods to aid in assessing whether imaging shows presence of tumor. Developing imaging technologies is critical for more accurately identifying location and amount of tumor, which will then lead to improvements in future cancer therapy.

This study aims to evaluate imaging methods known as PET and MRI to improve detection of cancerous tissue better than the types of imaging that are currently available.

These methods are conducted on the same machine as conventional MRI that uses a powerful magnet, radio waves, and a computer to create detailed images. Both the PET and MRI methods look at the number of proteins a tumor has. The more proteins, the more likely there is tumor relative to normal brain tissue.
