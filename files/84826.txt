Study of Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody for Patients With Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma Who Have Previously Received Rituximab
This is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter study of Iodine I-131 Anti B1 Antibody (Tositumomab and Iodine I 131 Tositumomab) for treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) who were previously treated with rituximab antibody. Patients must have been treated with at least 4 doses of rituximab and have progressed during or following rituximab therapy.

Patients will undergo two dosing phases of study. In the first phase, termed the "dosimetric dose", patients will receive an infusion of unlabeled Anti-B1 Antibody (450 mg) over 70 minutes immediately followed by a 30-minute infusion of Anti-B1 Antibody (35 mg) which has been radiolabeled with 5 mCi of Iodine-131. Whole body gamma camera scans will be obtained on Day 0; Day 2, 3, or 4; and Day 6 or 7 following the dosimetric dose. Using the dosimetric data from three imaging timepoints, a patient-specific dose of Iodine-131 will be calculated to deliver the desired total body dose of radiotherapy. In the second phase, termed the "therapeutic dose", patients will receive a 70-minute infusion of unlabeled Anti-B1 Antibody (450 mg) immediately followed by a 30-minute infusion of 35 mg Anti-B1 Antibody labeled with a patient-specific dose of Iodine-131 to deliver a whole body dose of 75 cGy to patients with no hematologic risk factors. Patients who have platelet counts of 100,001-149,999 cells/mm3 will receive 65 cGy and patients who are obese will be dosed based upon 137% of their lean body mass. Patients will be treated with either saturated solution potassium iodide (SSKI), Lugol's solution, or potassium iodide tablets starting at least 24 hours prior to the first infusion of the Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody (i.e., dosimetric dose) and continuing for 14 days following the last infusion of Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody (i.e., therapeutic dose).

The endpoints of the study are to determine the response rate, complete response rate, duration of response, and time to progression or death, based on both a Masked Independent Randomized Radiographic and Oncologic Review (MIRROR) panel and the Investigators, and the Investigators' assessment of safety and survival of survival of Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody therapy in NHL patients who have previously been treated with rituximab.

Infecting parasites seek to use the host's resources to reproduce, often resulting in disease. Specimen samples of the body fluid are cultured for testing whether the infectious organism is present and grown in the culture media to assess the growth pattern of the organisms present in the specimen. The culture results could be positive or negative. The positive culture results indicate that the tested participant has the infection under investigation, in which case therapeutic treatment with anti-infective is required., Participants were evaluated until death (up to 80.2 months in Study BEX104507) or were followed in the long-term follow-up study for up to 10.5 years|Number of Participants With an Infection for Which Anti-infectives Were Administered, Anti-infectives are capable of acting against infection, by inhibiting the spread of an infectious agent or by killing the infectious agent outright.
