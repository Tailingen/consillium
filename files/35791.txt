A Phase 1a/b Study of IK-175 as a Single Agent and in Combination With Nivolumab in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors and Urothelial Carcinoma
This study will be conducted in adult subjects diagnosed with any form of an advanced or metastatic solid tumors including urothelial carcinoma for which standard therapy is no longer effective or is intolerable. This is a phase 1, multi-center, open label study designed to assess safety and tolerability of IK-175 as a single agent and in combination with nivolumab, to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Disease response, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, and response biomarkers will also be assessed.
