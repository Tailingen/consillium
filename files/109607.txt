An Efficacy and Safety Study of Pevonedistat Plus Azacitidine Versus Single-Agent Azacitidine in Participants With Higher-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes (HR MDS), Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML) and Low-Blast Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pevonedistat plus azacitidine versus single-agent azacitidine in participants with HR-MDS or CMML, or low-blast AML.

DRUG: Azacitidine|DRUG: Pevonedistat
Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause. Participants without documented death at the time of the analysis were censored at the date the participant was last known to be alive. The Kaplan Meier estimates was used for the analysis., From date of randomization until death (up to 3 years and 5 months)
Event-Free Survival (EFS), EFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the occurrence of an event. An event is defined as death or transformation to AML for HR MDS/CMML participants, whichever occurs first, or defined as death for low-blast AML participants. HR MDS/CMML participants without documented EFS event will be censored at the date of the last response assessment. HR MDS/CMML participants with no response assessment and no death will be censored at the date of randomization. Low-blast AML participants without documentation of death will be censored at the date the participant was last known to be alive. HR MDS/CMML participants who received alternative antineoplastic therapy before death or transformation to AML will be censored at the date of last adequate assessment prior to starting alternate antineoplastic therapy.

The drug being tested in this study is called pevonedistat. Pevonedistat is being tested to treat people with MDS or CMML, or low-blast AML as a combination treatment with azacitidine. This study will look at the overall survival, event free survival and response to treatment in people who take pevonedistat and azacitidine when compared to people who take single-agent azacitidine.

The study will enroll 120 participants. Once enrolled, participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups in 28-day treatment cycles:

* Pevonedistat 20 mg/m\^2 and azacitidine 75 mg/m\^2 combination
* Single-agent azacitidine 75 mg/m\^2

All participants will receive azacitidine via intravenous or subcutaneous route. Participants randomized to the combination arm will also receive pevonedistat intravenous infusion.

This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this study is approximately 44 months. Participants will attend the end-of-treatment visit 30 days after the last dose of study drug or before the start of subsequent anti-neoplastic therapy if that occurs sooner. Participants will enter event-free survival follow-up or response follow-up (study visits every 3 months) if their disease has not transformed to AML (for participants with HR MDS or CMML) or progressed (for participants with low-blast AML), and they have not started subsequent therapy. Participants will also enter overall survival follow-up (contacted every 3 months to document subsequent therapies and survival status).
