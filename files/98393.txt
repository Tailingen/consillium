Maximum Plasma Concentration During the Dosing Interval at Steady State (CmaxSS), To assess the pharmacokinetics and establish bioequivalence of the Test Product (Olaparib tablets, 150 mg) relative to that of Reference Product (Lynparza® (olaparib) tablets 150 mg) in patients with Breast Cancer Gene (BRCA) mutated ovarian cancer, recurrent ovarian cancer or metastatic breast cancer., Pre-dose (0.00 hr) on day 1,6,7,8,14,15 and 16 and Post-dose on day 8 and day 16|Area Under the Plasma Concentration Versus Time Curve for One Dosing Interval at Steady State (AUC(0-t)ss), To assess the pharmacokinetics and establish bioequivalence of the Test Product (Olaparib tablets, 150 mg) relative to that of Reference Product (Lynparza® (olaparib) tablets 150 mg) in patients with BRCA mutated ovarian cancer, recurrent ovarian cancer or metastatic breast cancer., Pre-dose (0.00 hr) on day 1,6,7,8,14,15 and 16 and Post-dose on day 8 and day 16
Number of Serious Adverse Events, To monitor the serious adverse events of patients and to assess safety of each of the two formulations., up to Day 24|Number of Adverse Events, To monitor the adverse events of patients and to assess safety of each of the two formulations., up to Day 24
This is a two-way crossover bioequivalence study between test and reference product in patients diagnosed with BRCA mutated ovarian cancer, recurrent ovarian cancer or metastatic breast cancer.

Patients will be enrolled after providing written informed consent and treatments will be allocated to patient by carrying out randomization using statistical techniques.

Patients that are already on a stable dose of Lynparza® (olaparib) tablets and have met the eligibility criteria will be directly randomized for participation in the study.

After randomization patients will receive either test or reference product in a crossover manner based on the randomization schedule. Patients will receive the dose of 300 mg twice daily for 16 days in a crossover design.

In period-I (Day 1 to Day 8), patients will receive either Test product or Reference product for 8 days based on the randomization schedule.

In period-II (Day 9 to Day 16), patients will be switched to the other product for a second period of 8 days.
