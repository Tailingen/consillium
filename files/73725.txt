Endometrial and Myometrial Changes, With and Without Fibroids
fibroids are common among women in fertile age. the relation between fibroids and infertility is controversial. our goal is to claculate a ratio between uterine cavity - endometrium \& myometrium in normal uterine s and study the interference of the cavity in uterine s with fibroids.
Fibroids
ratio between normal & abnormal(by fibroid) uterine cavity, year
ratio between endometriom & myometrium area, circumference &n volume, year
phase 1-

1. retrospective measurments of uterine dimensions of 100 women with normal uterin
2. measurment of the above during different sycle days in the same woman. 30 women.

phase 2- retrospective measurments of 500 uterine dimensions of women with fibroids phase 3- the same for 400 uterine malformations
