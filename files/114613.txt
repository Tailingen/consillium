HAIC Plus Lenvatinib and PD-1 Antibody Versus HAIC Plus Lenvatinib for Advanced HCC
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy of oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin plus lenvatinib and programmed cell death protein-1 antibody compared with lenvtinib Alone in patients with hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy of oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin plus lenvatinib for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy|DRUG: Folfox Protocol|DRUG: Lenvatinib|DRUG: PD-1 antibody
Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the duration from the date of randomization until the date of death from any cause. Participants who were lost to follow-up were censored at the last date the participant was known to be alive, and participants who remained alive were censored at the time of data cutoff., 12 months
Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documentation of disease progression based on modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST), or date of death, whichever occurred first., 12 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on mRECIST. CR was defined as disappearance of any intratumoral arterial enhancement in all target lesions. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of viable (enhancement of arterial phase) target lesions taking as reference to the baseline sum of the diameters of target lesions., 12 months|Adverse Events, Number of adverse events. Postoperative adverse events were graded based on CTCAE v4.03, 12 months
Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) of oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin was effective and safe for hepatocellular carcinoma. Lenvatinib was non-inferior to sorafenib in overall survival in untreated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, and programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) antibody was effective and tolerable in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. No study has compared HAIC plus lenvatinib and PD-1 antibody with HAIC plus lenvatinib. Thus, the investigators carried out this prospective randomized control study to find out it.
