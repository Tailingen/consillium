Number of Participants With Best Overall Response, Best overall response for a participant is the best observed post-baseline disease response as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.0 criteria. Complete Response (CR): disappearance of all target lesions, non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. Partial Response (PR): at least 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of longest diameter. Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD), taking as reference the baseline smallest sum of longest diameter; persistence of 1 or more non-target lesion(s) or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits. PD: at least 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline smallest sum of longest diameter or appearance of 1 or more new lesions or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions., Baseline, assessed every 8 weeks up to 4 weeks after the last dose of study drug, where last dose was given up to Week 249|Percentage of Participants With Objective Response, Objective response rate defined as the rate of participants with CR or PR based on RECIST 1.0 criteria.

The drug being tested in this study is called trebananib (AMG 386). Trebananib (AMG 386) is being tested to treat people with advanced solid tumors.

This study will look at the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of trebananib and response to treatment.

The study will enroll approximately 18 participants. Once enrolled, participants will be assigned sequentially into 1 of the 3 cohorts:

* Trebananib 3 milligram/kilogram (mg/kg),
* Trebananib 10 mg/kg,
* Trebananib 30 mg/kg.

All participants will receive trebananib via 60 minute intravenous infusion. This study will be conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this study is 14 weeks or more. Participants will attend the end-of-treatment visit 28 days after the last dose of study drug.
