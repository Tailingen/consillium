Clinical Trial to Examine Individual Pain Tolerance in the Use of Two Anesthetic Techniques to Perform Saturation Prostate Biopsy
To assess the effectiveness of two anesthetic techniques by measuring the pain through visual analog scale (VAS), to obtain saturation prostate biopsies.
Prostatic Cancer
DRUG: MIDAZOLAM|DRUG: MEPIVACA√çNE|DRUG: FENTANILE|DRUG: KETAMINE
Change in visual analog scale (VAS), Change in visual analog scale (VAS) from baseline and after prostate biopsy, 1 hour baseline
Number of patients with complications after anesthesic procedure and prostate biopsy procedure, after 24 hours of the procedure and at end of study visit. All units will be measured as numbers., To assess the safety of the procedure and complications in the use of each of the anesthetic techniques during saturation prostate biopsy. Safety events will be measured during saturation prostate biopsy and after recovery, during 24 hours. Number of patients with complications after anesthesic procedure and prostate biopsy procedure. Number of patients with complications after 24 hours of the procedure. Number of patients with complications at end of study visit., One week
To assess the effectiveness of two anesthetic techniques by measuring the pain through visual analog scale (VAS), to obtain saturation prostate biopsies.

Anesthetic technique (control) - Intravenous sedation with Midazolam, Fentanile and Ketamine.

Anesthetic technique (intervention) - Regional Mepivacaine infiltration of periprostatic region.
