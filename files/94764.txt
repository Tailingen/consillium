ACT-MBC: A Study of Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) in Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC)
ACT-MBC prospectively assesses the impact of CTCs on treatment decisions, response assessment and prognosis in MBC patients.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: CellSearch Circulating Tumor Cells
To prospectively evaluate the impact of CellSearch CTCs on treatment decisions and response assessment in MBC patients, Assessing proportion of providers that find CellSearch CTCs helpful in determining response to therapy in each unique patient (Questionnaire #2)., 3 to 4 months
Assess barriers and receptiveness of providers in using CTCs in clinical practice, Assessing provider perception of the general usefulness of CTC in pre and post-intervention surveys (Questionnaire #1 and #3), 18 months|Evaluate if CTC results correlate with response assessment and disease progression defined by standard of care imaging, Compare baseline and on treatment serial CTCs assessment to identify correlations with first restaging studies and with progression free survival, 18 months
ACT-MBC prospectively assesses the impact of CTCs on treatment decisions, response assessment and prognosis in MBC patients.
