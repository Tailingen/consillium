PROMIS-29 quality of life outcome measures for patients undergoing endoscopic endonasal surgeries., This study aims to better understand the long-term overall quality of life of patients undergoing endoscopic endonasal surgery using modern sinonasal reconstruction techniques. The PROMIS-29 metric, an overall quality of life metric, will be used to better understand quality of life for patients undergoing this procedure., 24-months post-operatively
ASK Nasal-12 questionnaire used to measure normal time of healing for patients undergoing endoscopic endonasal surgery, This study aims to better understand the overall nose function in patients undergoing endoscopic endonasal surgery using modern sinonasal techniques. The ASK Nasal-12 metric is designed to evaluate nose overall nose function such as post-nasal drip, ability to smell, and pain., 24 months post-operatively|Number of patients with long-term quality of life risk factors using PROMIS-29, This study aims to better understand the number of long-term risk factors for patients undergoing endoscopic endonasal surgeries using modern sinonasal reconstruction techniques. This will be done using the PROMIS-29 metric along with patient data., 24 months post-operatively|Number of patients with long-term procedural comorbidities using ASK-Nasal 12., This study aims to better understand the number of long-term comorbidities for patients undergoing endonasal endoscopic surgeries using modern sinonasal reconstruction techniques. This will be done using the ASK-Nasal 12 metric along with patient data., 24 months post-operatively
This is a prospective single-institution longitudinal study to access quality of life in patients who undergo endonasal endoscopic approach surgeries of the skull base. Patients will be followed before surgery and up to twenty-four months post-surgery. The primary goal of the study is to assess the alterations to patient quality of life following endoscopic endonasal surgery using modern sinonasal reconstruction techniques. Secondary goals are to better understand the time course of normal healing and patient/procedural risk factors associated with poorer quality of life outcomes.
