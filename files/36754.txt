S0106B Studying Bone Marrow Samples From Women With Acute Myeloid Leukemia
RATIONALE: Studying samples of bone marrow from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer.

PURPOSE: This research trial studies bone marrow samples from women with acute myeloid leukemia.

Association between CD33+ precursors and cytogenetic and/or molecular risks using Fisher's exact test, May 2012|Relationship between emergence of individual mutations [t(8;21), inv(16), FLT3/ITD, NPM1, CEBPA, and KIT], clonality, and stage of cell differentiation using Fisher's exact test, May 2012|Associations between survival outcomes (OS, EFS, DFS, RR, and relapse rate) and CD33+ restriction using regression analysis, May 2012
OBJECTIVES:

* Estimate the proportion of acute myeloid leukemia (AMLs) that originate in CD33+ precursors or in which uncontrolled growth is limited to CD33+ precursors.
* Explore whether there is an association between the cellular origin of AML (i.e., origination in CD33+ precursors or not) and cytogenetic, molecular, and other patient characteristics.
* Explore whether overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), disease-free survival (DFS), response rate (RR), or relapse rate is improved for patients with AMLs that originate in CD33+ precursors or in which uncontrolled growth is limited to CD33+ precursors compared to patients with clonally involved cells not detected.

OUTLINE: Archived bone marrow samples are analyzed for CD33+ progenitors, X-chromosome inactivation, and somatic mutations (t(8;21), inv(16), FLT3/ITD, NPM1, CEBPA, KIT) by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, long-term culture in hypoxic condition in cytokine-containing liquid media, and flow cytometry. Results are then compared with each patient clinical data.
