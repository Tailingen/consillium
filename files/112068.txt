This study will randomize sixty (60) participants receiving cancer chemotherapy treatment to receive nurse-led care coordination using a HIPAA-compliant mobile health platform compared to no technology-enhanced care coordination.

All participants receive nurse-led care coordination throughout chemotherapy treatment.

RESEARCH AIMS:

* Demonstration of a HIPAA-compliant social networking platform;
* Facilitate communication and collaboration among patients with cancer and their care team;
* Assess patient health outcomes (chemotherapy-related physical and psychological side effects; pain, quality of life and patient satisfaction)
