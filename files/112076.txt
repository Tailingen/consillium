Safety and Efficacy of BCMA-Targeted CAR-T Therapy for Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma
This is a single arm study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BCMA-targeted CAR-T cells therapy for patients with relapsed/refractory Multiple Myeloma.
Multiple Myeloma|Multiple Myeloma in Relapse|Neoplasm, Plasma Cell
BIOLOGICAL: BCMA CAR-T cells
Adverse events that related to treatment, Therapy-related adverse events will be recorded and assessed according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, Version 5.0), 2 years|The response rate of BCMA CAR-T treatment in patients with relapse/refractory Multiple Myeloma that treatment by BCMA CAR-T cells therapy, The response rate of BCMA CAR-T treatment will be recorded and assessed according to the IMWG, 6 months
Rate of BCMA CAR-T cells in bone marrow and peripheral blood, In vivo (bone marrow and peripheral blood) rate of BCMA CAR-T cells were determined by means of flow cytometry, 2 years|Quantity of BCMA CAR copies in bone marrow and peripheral blood, In vivo (bone marrow and peripheral blood) quantity of BCMA CAR copies were determined by means of qPCR, 2 years|Quantity of clonal plasma cells in bone marrow, In vivo (bone marrow) quantity of clonal plasma cells, 1 years|Levels of IL-6 in Serum, In vivo (Serum) quantity of IL-6, 3 months|Duration of Response (DOR) of BCMA CAR-T treatment in patients with refractory/relapsed Multiple Myeloma, DOR will be assessed from the first assessment of sCR/CR/VGPR/PR to the first assessment of recurrence or progression of the disease or death from any cause (censored), 2 years|Progress-free survival(PFS) of BCMA CAR-T treatment in patients with refractory/relapsed multiple myeloma, PFS will be assessed from the first CAR-T cell infusion to death from any cause or the first assessment of progression (censored), 2 years|Overall survival(OS) of BCMA CAR-T treatment in patients with refractory/relapsed multiple myeloma, OS will be assessed from the first CAR-T cell infusion to death from any cause (censored), 2 years
There are limited options for treatment of relapse/refractory Multiple Myeloma. BCMA is expressed on most Multiple Myeloma cells so it is an ideal target for CAR-T. In this study, investigators will evaluate the safety and efficacy of CAR-T targeting BCMA in patients with relapsed/refractory Multiple Myeloma. The primary goal is safety and efficiency assessment, including adverse events and disease status after treatment.
