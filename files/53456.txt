18F-FAPI PET/CT in Patients With Various Types of Cancer
To evaluate the potential usefulness of 18F-FAPI positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) for the diagnosis of primary and metastatic lesions in various types of cancer.
Cancer
DRUG: 18F-FAPI
Diagnostic accuracy, The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 18F-FAPI PET/CT were calculated., 1 year
Subjects with various types of cancer underwent 18F-FAPI PET/CT either for an initial assessment or for recurrence detection. Tumor uptake was quantified by the maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax). Using histopathology and follow-up as gold standard, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and accuracy of 18F-FAPI PET/CT were calculated.
