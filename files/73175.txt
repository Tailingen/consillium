Skin Biophysical Measures for Assessing Head and Neck Cancer-Related External Lymphedema
Selected measurements in healthy persons of skin tissue dielectric constant as reference values for subsequent use to evaluate patients with head and neck lymphedema.

Skin tissue dielectric constant (TDC) measurements will non-invasively be made bilaterally at two neck sites, bilaterally on two forearm sites and one site at the chin sub-mental area.

Measurements are made with subjects fully clothed and seated. Measurements are made in triplicate and averaged at each site. Full measurements take about 5-7 minutest to complete. Data will be analyzed to determine the neck-to-arm ratios and chin-to-arm ratios to establish normal ranges of these parameters for subsequent use as comparisons to evaluate and track changes in patients with head and neck lymphedema.
