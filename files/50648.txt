PET Imaging With 89Zr-DFO-Trastuzumab in Esophagogastric Cancer
The purpose of the first group (Group 1) was to find the optimal time for taking pictures after injection of 89Zr-DFO-trastuzumab, to see how long it stayed in the blood, and to see how well it was tolerated. From what the investigators have learned from Group 1, patients in Group 2 no longer need serial scans or serial blood draws. This study is based on a cohort expansion. All data is appropriately reported as there is only one study cohort
Esophagogastric Cancer
RADIATION: 89Zr-DFO-trastuzumab|DEVICE: PET imaging
Safety as Measured by the Number of Participants Who Experienced Toxicity, Participants will be evaluated for toxicity using CTCAE v4.0, 2 years|Feasibility of Antibody-imaging, Antibody imaging is considered feasible if 70% of the patients are antibody-imaging positive. Antibody imaging will be considered feasible if 7 or more of the 10 patients in the first cohort are antibody-imaging-positive. We will also require that none of these patients experience severe toxicity attributable to the initial antibody., 2 years
Biologic Half-time, Samples will be obtained just prior to injection of the 89Zr DFO-trastuzumab tracer this sample will be banked at -80degree C for future testing for Human anti-human antibody/HAHA if altered biodistribution is observed., Up to 580 hours
