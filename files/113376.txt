Vactosertib in Combination with Pembrolizumab in Metastatic Colorectal or Gastric Cancer
This is an open-label, multicenter study to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and antitumor activity of vactosertib in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic or locally advanced colorectal or gastric/gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer|Gastric Cancer|Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: TEW-7197
Maximum Tolerated Dose, Incidence of nature of DLTs, approximately 2 years|Safety and Tolerability, Incidence, nature and severity of adverse events (AEs) graded according to NCI CTCAE v5.0, approximately 2 years
Efficacy 1, Objective response rate (ORR) as assessed using RECIST version 1.1 and iRECIST by investigators, approximately 2 years|Efficacy 2, Progression Free Survival (PFS), approximately 2 years|Efficacy 3, Overall Survival (OS), up to 3 years
This is phase 1b/2a, open label, multi-center study to assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor activity of vactosertib in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with mCRC including CMS4 or diffuse GC/GEJC with two phases (Dose Finding Phase and Dose Expansion Phase). At screening, CMS4 will be classified by an experienced pathologist in the central lab that will examine the histology of primary surgical tissues. Approximately, 67 total patients are expected to be enrolled in this study. The first phase of the study, the Dose Finding Phase, will determine the MTD of the combination regimen. The second phase, the Dose Expansion Phase, will further evaluate the combination regimen to confirm RP2D.
