Phase I Safety Study of Dendritic Cell Vaccine to Treat Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The primary objective of this study is to answer the question "Is it possible to inject the COMBIG-DC vaccine in a hepatic tumor without getting unacceptable side effects"?
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: COMBIG-DC (ilixadencel)
Registration of adverse events as a measure of safety and tolerability, * Changes in vital signs from baseline (heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature)
* Changes in lab parameters from baseline
* Short term worsening in ECOG and/or Child Pugh and/or MELD score
* Local procedural injuries, assessed by MRI or ultrasound, Up to 6 months after last patient's last vaccination
To evaluate systemic inflammatory response, Potential systemic release of relevant cytokines, chemokines and other inflammatory parameters in blood;IL-1R, IL-2,IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-17A, G-CSF. GM-CSF, IFN-gamma, MCP-1, MIP-1 beta and TNF-alpha., Until 3 months after last vaccination|To evaluate tumor control, * CT/MRI evaluation 3 and 6 months after first vaccination. Patients with stable disease or tumor response will continue tumor evaluation every 3rd month until progress or until last study patient has had his/her 6 month visit.
* Measuring number of tumor specific T cells with flow cytometry after in vitro stimulation with different pools of HCC-associated tumor peptides (Alpha-feto protein (AFP), and hTERT)
* Measuring AFP (alpha-feto protein) levels in blood
* Measuring the level of circulating tumor cell, identified as tested positive for MICA, EpCAM, CD133, CD34, CK18, Until 6 months after last patient's last vaccination|Long term changes in ECOG scores, 3 and 6 months after last vaccination|Change in body weight, 3 and 6 months after last vaccination|To evaluate systemic immunological response, * Vaccine cell tracking; PBMCs will be stained with antibodies specific for one HLA class I or one HLA-class II antigen that is selectively expressed on donor vaccine cells.
* vaccine-induced alloimmunization; screening of alloantibodies against HLA-A, B, C (MHC-class I) and HLA-DR, DQ, DP (MHC-class II) antigens
* autoimmune events; screening of autoantibodies against autoantigens, including nuclear antigens (ANA, SSA, SSB, Sm, RNP, Scl-70, Centromeres and Jo-1) and liver parenchyma-associated autoantigens (liver-kidney microsomal antigens and mitochondrial antigens)
* complement activation; classical/alternative complement function, C3, C4, C3d, and Factor-B.
* immune cell occurrence and activation state; CD3+ , CD3+4+ and CD3+8+ T cells, CD19+ B-cells CD3-16+56+ NK-cells, CD3-16+56+69+ NK cells, CD3+16+56+ NKT-cells, CD3+16+56+69+ NKT-cells and CD3+HLA-DR+ T cells., Up to 3 months after last vaccination|Long term changes in Quality of Life scores, 3 and 6 months after last vaccination|To evaluate immunological response, * complement activation; classical/alternative complement function, C3, C4, C3d, and Factor-B.
* immune cell occurrence and activation state; CD3+ , CD3+4+ and CD3+8+ T cells, CD19+ B-cells CD3-16+56+ NK-cells, CD3-16+56+69+ NK cells, CD3+16+56+ NKT-cells, CD3+16+56+69+ NKT-cells and CD3+HLA-DR+ T cells., Up to 3 months after last vaccination|Changes in HBV, HCV virus titers, Changes in HBV, HCV virus titers vs baseline, for patients that are tested positive at screening, Day 8 after each injection and at the 3 and 6 months visit|To study time to progress (TTP), TTP measured as time from first dose of COMBIG-DC until radiologically proven progress according to mRECIST., Measured every 3 months until progression|To study overall survival (OS), OS measured as survival time from first dose of COMBIG-DC until end of study or death (whichever comes first), Up to 6 months after last patient's last vaccination
Local tissue changes in injected/non-injected tumor and surrounding tissue, assessed by MRI, An optional addition to the assessment of local procedural injuries (primary outcome)., 1 month after each vaccination
Patients diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma will get COMBIG-DC vaccinations at three occasions with 2-3 weeks and 3-5 weeks between vaccination 2 and 3 respectively. Adverse events will be registered until 6 months after last vaccination, as well as changes in vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure and body temperature) and lab parameters. Immunologic response will be evaluated by measuring immunologic markers in blood. The size of the tumor/tumors will be evaluated after 3 and 6 months and thereafter every three months until tumor progression.

For patients included after approval of Amendment 3 (2015-12-10), COMBIG-DC will be given as add on to standard treatment; sorafenib or Transarterial Chemoembolization (TACE).
