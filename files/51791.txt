Fecal Microbial Transplants for the Treatment of Pancreatic Cancer
This early phase I trial examines the safety and effects of fecal microbial transplants in treating patients with pancreatic cancer. scheduled for surgery to remove tumors. Fecal microbial transplant contains the normal microbes found in fecal (stool) material. Giving fecal microbial transplant may help control the disease.
Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma
PROCEDURE: Fecal Microbiota Transplantation|DRUG: Fecal Microbiota Transplantation Capsule|OTHER: Questionnaire Administration|PROCEDURE: Resection|PROCEDURE: Therapeutic Colonoscopy
Incidence of adverse events, Will be measured by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5., Up to 30 days after surgery
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To assess the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in resectable patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To assess changes in gut microbiome of PDAC patients after FMT. II. To assess changes in oral microbiome of PDAC patients after FMT. III. To assess changes in tumor microbiome of PDAC patients after FMT. IV. To determine immunological/molecular changes in the tumor after FMT.

OUTLINE:

Patients undergo FMT during colonoscopy. Patients also receive FMT capsules orally (PO) once weekly (QW) for 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo standard of care resection of tumor(s).

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2 weeks and 30, 60, 90, and 180 days after surgery.
