This is a single-arm and open-label phase II study of Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma patients who have received at least one prior lines of treatment therapy; This study includes two experimental arms. Arm I is given XDd regimen (ATG-010 80mg/d QW, Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin 25mg/m2, d1and Dexamethasone 40mg/d QW) in approximately 25 subjects. Arm II is given XCd regimen (ATG-010 100mg/d QW, Cyclophosphamide 300mg/m2, d1and Dexamethasone 40mg/d QW). Both arms are 4 weeks per cycle and include a total of 12 cycles.
