Molecular Imaging of Gastrin Releasing Peptide Receptors Using Labeled Technetium-99m RM26
The study should evaluate the biological distribution of 99mTc-RM26 in patients with prostate cancer and breast cancer.

The primary objective are:

1. To assess the distribution of 99mTc- RM26 in normal tissues and tumors at different time intervals.
2. To evaluate dosimetry of 99mTc- RM26.
3. To study the safety and tolerability of the drug 99mTc- RM26 after a single injection in a diagnostic dosage.

The secondary objective are:

1. To compare the obtained 99mTc- RM26 SPECT imaging results with the data of CT and/or MRI and/or ultrasound examination and immunohistochemical (IHC) studies in prostate cancer and breast cancer patients.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: whole body study and SPECT with 99mTc-RM26
Gamma camera-based whole-body 99mTc-RM26 uptake value (%), Whole-body 99mTc-RM26 uptake coinciding with normal organs and tissues will be assessed using gamma camera and calculated as percentage (%) of the injected dose of the radiopharmaceutical, 24 hours|SPECT-based 99mTc-RM26 value in tumor lesions (counts), 99mTc-RM26 uptake coinciding with tumor lesions will be assessed using single-photon emission computed tomography and measured in counts, 6 hours|SPECT-based 99mTc-RM26 uptake value (counts), Focal uptake of 99mTc-RM26 in the regions without pathological findings will be assessed with SPECT and measured in counts, 6 hours|Tumor-to-background ratio (SPECT), The SPECT-based tumor-to-background ratio will be calculated as follows: the value of 99mTc-RM26 uptake coinciding with tumor lesions (counts) will be divided by the value of 99mTc-RM26 uptake coinciding with the regions without pathological findings (counts), 6 hours
Safety attributable to 99mTc-RM26 injections (physical findings), The safety attributable to 99mTc-RM26 injections will be evaluated based on the assessments of physical examination, vital signs, and ECG (percent of cases with abnormal findings relative to baseline), 24 hours|Safety attributable to 99mTc-RM26 injections (laboratory tests), The safety attributable to 99mTc-RM26 injections will be evaluated based on the blood and urine laboratory tests (percent of cases with abnormal findings relative to baseline), 24 hours|Safety attributable to 99mTc-RM26 injections (incidence and severity of adverse events), The safety attributable to 99mTc-RM26 injections will be evaluated based on the rate of adverse events (percent), 24 hours|Safety attributable to 99mTc-RM26 injections (concomitant medication), The safety attributable to 99mTc-RM26 injections will be evaluated based on the rate of administration of concomitant medication (percent), 24 hours
The overall goal is to study the effectiveness of SPECT imaging prostate cancer and breast cancer patients Using technetium-99m labeled RM26.

Phase I of the study:

Biodistribution of 99mTc-RM26 in patients with prostate cancer and breast cancer.

The main objectives of the study:

1. To evaluate the distribution of 99mTc-RM26 in normal tissues and tumors in patients with prostate cancer and breast cancer at different time intervals.
2. To evaluate dosimetry of 99mTc-RM26 based on the pharmacokinetic parameters of the drug after a single intravenous administration.
3. To study the safety of use and tolerability of the drug 99mTc-RM26 after a single intravenous administration in a diagnostic dosage.

Additional research tasks:

1. To conduct a comparative analysis of the diagnostic information obtained in the visualization of prostate cancer and breast cancer by SPECT using 99mTc-RM26 with data obtained by CT and/or MRI and/or ultrasound examination and immunohistochemical (IHC) research of postoperative material.

Methodology:

Open-label, exploratory, single centre study. The subjects will receive a single injection of the labeled tracer.
