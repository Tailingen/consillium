Oral Care of Patients Treated With Anti-RANK-ligand Antibodies for a Giant Cell Tumour
Giant cell tumors are mostly benign tomoral processes, most often responsible for areas of osteolysis in the metaphysoepiphyseal area of long bones, representing 5-6% of primary bone tumors. The bone weakening induced by these beaches leads to pain and risk of fracture, and this is what leads the patient to consult.

These tumors are found particularly in the young adult population between 20 and 40 years old, are locally aggressive, but malignant transformations and metastases (pulmonary) are quite rare.

In this study, the investigators wish to retrospectively study the oral care of patients who presented with a giant cell tumor and were treated with Denosumab at the University Hospital of Strasbourg and their associated oral follow-up
