Phase 3 Randomized, Open-Label Study of Guadecitabine vs Treatment Choice in Previously Treated Acute Myeloid Leukemia
Multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group study of guadecitabine vs treatment choice (TC). Participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either guadecitabine or TC. TC options include the 8 high or low intensity, locally available regimens below; or Best supportive Care (BSC) alone:

* High intensity (intermediate or high dose cytarabine \[HiDAC\]; mitoxantrone, etoposide, and cytarabine \[MEC\]; or fludarabine, cytarabine, granulocyte colony stimulating factor \[G-CSF\], +/- idarubicin \[FLAG/FLAG-Ida\]).
* Low intensity (low dose cytarabine \[LDAC\], decitabine, or azacitidine).
* BSC.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: guadecitabine|DRUG: Treatment Choice (TC)
Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as number of days from day of randomization to date of death, regardless of cause., From the date of randomization until the date of death, or approximately 34 months
Event-Free Survival, Event-free survival is defined as number of days from randomization to earliest date of treatment discontinuation (for reasons other than initiation of hematopoietic cell transplant \[HCT\]), start of alternative anti-leukemia therapy (except HCT), or death., From the date of randomization until the date of death, or approximately 38 months|Long-Term Survival, Survival rate at 1 year after randomization; participants were also followed to estimate 2-year survival rate., Up to approximately 38 months|Number of Days Alive and Out of the Hospital (NDAOH), Number of days participants alive and out of hospital during first 6 months of the study., 6 months|Transfusion Independence Rate, Number of participants without red blood cells (RBC) or platelet transfusion for any 8-week period after treatment divided by total number of participants in efficacy analysis., Baseline up to approximately 38 months|Complete Response Rate, The Complete response (CR) rate based on modified International Working Group (IWG) 2003 AML Response Criteria was calculated as the number of participants with a best response of CR divided by the total number of participants included in the efficacy analysis. CR as per modified 2003 IWG AML Response Criteria is absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1000/μL, platelets ≥100,000/μL, independence from red blood cells (RBC) and platelet transfusions over the past week, no leukemic blasts in peripheral blood and bone marrow should contain less than 5% blast cells., Baseline to end of treatment, or approximately 38 months|Combined Complete Response and Complete Response With Partial Hematologic Recovery Rate, The combined CR and CR with partial hematologic recovery rate based on modified International Working Group (IWG) 2003 AML Response Criteria was calculated as number of participants with CR and CR with partial hematologic recovery divided by the total number of participants included in the efficacy analysis. CR as per modified 2003 IWG AML Response Criteria is absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1000/μL, platelets ≥100,000/μL, independence from red blood cells (RBC) and platelet transfusions over the past week, no leukemic blasts in peripheral blood and bone marrow should contain less than 5% blast cells., Baseline to end of treatment, or approximately 38 months|Composite Complete Response Rate, Composite complete response rate based on modified IWG 2003 AML Response Criteria defined as number of participants with best response of CR, CR with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp), or CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) divided by total number of participants in efficacy analysis. CR as per modified 2003 IWG AML Response Criteria is ANC ≥1000/μL, platelets ≥100,000/μL, independence from RBC and platelet transfusions over the past week, no leukemic blasts in peripheral blood and bone marrow should contain less than 5% blast cells. CRp is defined as ANC ≥1000/μL, Platelets \<100,000/μL, independence from RBC transfusions over the past week, no leukemic blasts and bone marrow should contain less than 5% blast cells. CRi is defined as ANC \<1000/μL, no leukemic blasts and bone marrow should contain less than 5% blast cells., Baseline to end of treatment, or approximately 38 months|Hematopoietic Cell Transplant (HCT) Rate, Number of participants who received HCT after randomization divided by total number of participants in efficacy analysis., Baseline to long term follow-up or approximately 38 months|Duration of Complete Response (CR) + CR With Partial Hematologic Recovery (CRh), The time from first CR or CRh to time of relapse (the date of the earliest of the following 3 events):

1. relapse (defined as the earliest time point whereby BM assessment or PB assessment by the investigator indicate relapse/disease progression due to confirmed reappearance of leukemic blasts in PB or ≥5% leukemic blasts in BM, or clinical progression determined by the investigator),
2. start of alternative therapy (except HCT) or
3. death., Baseline to end of treatment, or approximately 38 months|Change From Baseline in EuroQoL-5 Dimension 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) Index Scores, Index score is calculated based on 5-level version of the EQ-5D descriptive system using the value set for England.

The range of index score is from -0.281 (for the worst health state, score of 5 for all categories) to 1 (for the best health state, score of 1 for all categories)., Baseline to 6 months|Change in EQ-5D-5L Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Score, VAS score is obtained using vertical 20-cm visual analogue scale with the top value of 100 labelled as 'the best health you can imagine' and the bottom value of 0 labelled as 'the worst health you can imagine'., Baseline to 6 months|Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically significant abnormal finding in laboratory tests or other diagnostic procedures), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality., From first dose until 30 days after the last dose of study drug, or approximately 38 months|All-Cause Mortality, All-cause mortality in the first 30 days and first 60 days after the start of treatment divided by the total number of participants receiving at least one dose of study treatment., From the first dose until 60 days after the first dose of study drug
This Phase 3, randomized, open-label, parallel-group multicenter study of the efficacy and safety of guadecitabine in adults with previously treated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) will be conducted in approximately 20 countries. There will be a 14-day screening period, a treatment period, a safety follow-up visit, and a long-term follow-up period. The study is expected to last approximately 2 years. Duration of individual participant participation will vary, and participants may continue to receive treatment for as long as they continue to benefit.

Approximately 404 participants from approximately 100 study centers will be randomly assigned to either guadecitabine or treatment choice (TC) in a 1:1 ratio (approximately 202 participants per group). TC is as follows:

* High intensity: intermediate or high dose cytarabine (HiDAC); mitoxantrone, etoposide, and cytarabine (MEC); or fludarabine, cytarabine, G-CSF, +/- idarubicin (FLAG/FLAG-Ida).
* Low intensity: low dose cytarabine (LDAC), decitabine, or azacitidine.
* Best Supportive Care (BSC).

Guadecitabine will be given subcutaneous (SC) at a dose of 60 microgram per meter square (mg/m\^2) in 28-day cycles. In Cycle 1, guadecitabine will be given for 10 days on Days 1-5 and Days 8-12. Cycle 2 will be either the 5-day regimen (Days 1-5) or 10-day regimen (Days 1-5 and 8-12) based on assessment of disease response and hematologic recovery at the end of Cycle 1. In subsequent cycles, guadecitabine treatment will be for 5 days only (Days 1-5).
