LILRB4 STAR-T Cells in the Treatment of R/R AML/CMML
This study is an exploratory study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of LILRB4 STAR-T cells in relapsed and refractory acute myeloid leukemia/Chronic Granulocytic-Mononocytic Leukemia subjects.
Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Chronic Granulocytic-Mononocytic Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: LILRB4 STAR-T cells
Evaluate safety and tolerability, Subjects are observed for dose-limiting toxicity(DLT) after LILRB4 STAR-T cells infusion, with the recording of adverse events(AE) and serious adverse events(SAE), with a focus on cytokine release syndrome(CRS) and immune cell-associated neurotoxicity(ICANS).All of the AE ratings were assessed according to the CTCAE., 12 months

This study will recruit LILRB4 positive AML/Chronic Granulocytic-Mononocytic Leukemia subjects,and Subjects will receive cytoreductive chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine on days -5, -4 and -3 followed by infusion of LILRB4 STAR-T cells. LILRB4 STAR-T cells will be intravenously infused with a escalated dose of 1E6, 3E6, 6E6, 1E7 cells/kg.Safety and efficacy of LILRB4 STAR-T cells therapy will be monitored.The primary endpoint of the study is to observe DLT, AE, SAE, CRS and ICANS. Secondary objectives are to observe the efficacy of LILRB4 STAR-T cells, including Disease response, CR rate, ORR, RFS, EFS, OS, PK, PD and ADA.
