Phase Ib/II Trail of Neoadjuvant of Tislelizumab Combined With Palbociclib in Patients With Platinum-refractory Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma
In order to explore the safety and antitumor efficacy of different doses of CDK4/6 inhibitor Palbociclib in combination with the Tislelizumab in platinum-refractory cT2-4aN0M0 bladder urothelial carcinoma, a phase Ib/II study was conducted.

This study will adopt a 3+3 design and include two predefined dose groups of palbociclib: 100mg QD, 125mg QD. Initially, Tislelizumab, 200 mg administered by intravenous infusion on Day 1 of each 21-day will be administered in combination. The trial will use the first cycle (28 days) as the observation period for tolerability, observing and evaluating the occurrence of DLTs after medication and determining the maximum tolerated dose/maximum administered dose (MTD/MAD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the combination therapy (30 patients) .

This study provide further evidence for improving the efficacy of neoadjuvant treatment forplatinum-refractory cT2-4aN0M0 bladder urothelial carcinoma and to offer new options for precision treatment of bladder cancer.
Bladder Cancer
DRUG: Tislelizumab combined with two predefined dose groups of palbociclib|DRUG: RP2D dose Of Tislelizumab combined with palbociclib was selected for phase II clinical trial.
Phase I: the safety dose of the combination of Tislelizumab and palbociclib, The study aims to evaluate the safety dose of the combination of Tislelizumab combined with palbociclib in patients with cT2-4aN0M0 bladder cancer. The safety dose was according to "3+3" dose escalation principle.

In this study, Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as drug-related adverse reactions (according to the NCI CTC 5.0 grading criteria) after treatment: ≥ Grade II liver and kidney injury, grade III other non-hematological toxicity, and grade IV hematological toxicity., 12 months|Phase II: Pathological complete response rate(pCR), pathological complete response rate (pCR rate), the measure to determine whether complete response (pT0N0) is achieved based on pathological findings of surgical tissue samples., 24 months
Pathological Downstaging(pDS), The pathological downstaging rate is defined as the evaluation of whether the staging is degraded to ≤ T2 based on the post-surgery pathological findings. The rates of cT2N0 → pT0N0, cT3-4aN0 → pT0N0, cT2N0 → ≤ pT1N0, cT3-4aN0 → ≤ pT1N0 will be calculated, and the 2 sided Clopper-Pearson 95% confidence interval (CI) of pathological downstaging rate will be calculated to assess the precision of the estimated pathological downstaging rat, 24 months|Event-free survival (EFS), Event-free survival (EFS) is defined as the time from the start of first dose of neoadjuvant treatment to disease progression, death from any cause, or onset of other tumors., 24 months|overall survival (OS), OS defined as the time from the date the participant started study drug to death for any reason., 24 months|Safety and AE, During safety analysis, extent of exposure to investigational agents (including duration of exposure and dosage)and AEs will be summarized. Description of AEs will be mapped to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terms and graded per NCI-CTCAE v5.0. All TEAEs will be summarized. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an AE that had a worsening in severity from baseline (pretreatment) on or after the first dose of investigational agent(s) and up to 30 days after investigational agent(s) discontinuation or initiation of a new anticancer therapy. Postoperative complications (surgery-related AE) will be graded according to the Clavien-Dindo classification., 24 months
Biomarker Endpoint Analyses, To explore biomarkers in urine, blood, and tumor tissues (collected from TURBT) at baseline and tissue samples collected from radical cystectomy and their association with patient prognosis, clinical efficacy, and drug resistance. Biomarkers include PD-L1, Ki67 expression in tumor tissues, immune cells profiling and gene expression and tumor mutation profiling., 24 months
