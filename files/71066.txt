Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy and Retifanlimab in Patients With Selected Sarcomas (TORNADO)
Multicenter, prospective, open-labeled, 2-arm, non-comparative randomized phase II trial to assess the antitumor activity of retifanlimab (INCMGA00012) in association with neoadjuvant chemotherapy
Resectable Sarcoma
DRUG: Doxorubicin|DRUG: Ifosfamide|DRUG: INCMGA00012
Assessment of the antitumor activity of retifanlimab when prescribed in association with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (doxorubicin+ifosfamide), Antitumor activity will be assessed in terms of histological response based on surgical sample, 5 months after treatment onset
1-year progression-free survival, Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from study treatment initiation to the first occurrence of disease progression or death (of any cause), 1 year|3-year progression-free survival, Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from study treatment initiation to the first occurrence of disease progression or death (of any cause), 3 years|1-year overall survival, Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from study treatment initiation to death (of any cause)., 1 year|3-year overall survival, Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from study treatment initiation to death (of any cause)., 3 years|Safety profile independently for each arm: Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse event version 5, Toxicity will be grade using the Common Terminology Criteria for adverse events version 5 and coded according to the standardized medical terminology MedDRA, Throughout the treatment period, an expected average of 6 months
This is a multicenter, prospective, open-labeled, 2-arm, non-comparative randomized (1:1) phase II trial. Patients will be randomized between arm A (neodjuvant chemotherapy by doxorubicin + ifosfamide) and arm B (neodjuvant chemotherapy by doxorubicin + ifosfamide and retifanlimab) with one patient randomized in arm A for one patient randomized in arm B.
