Tempus Sculptor Study: Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) Observational Study
The study is a non-interventional evaluation of participants with SCLC who will receive diagnostic and (where possible) post-progression tumor tissue profiling, alongside plasma ctDNA biomarker profiling in addition to their standard of care therapy and disease surveillance.
