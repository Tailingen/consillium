This Phase I, open-label, non-randomized study is designed to determine the absolute bioavailability of the standard 2 mg tablet formulation of GSK1120212 co-administered with an intravenous microdose (5 Î¼g) dose of \[14C\]-labelled GSK1120212 (7.4 kBq) in subjects with solid tumors. Pharmacokinetic sampleswill be obtained up to 10 days post-dose. Safety assessments, including assessment of adverse events, clinical laboratory values (hematology and clinical chemistry) and vital signs, will be performed throughout the study. After completing all assessments, eligible subjects may transition to MEK114375, an open-label, rollover study to continue treatment with GSK1120212.
