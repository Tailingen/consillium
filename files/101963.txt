Laparoscopic Versus Open Left Colonic Resection
The main goal of this study is to clarify if laparoscopy (LPS) could become the standard approach in patients undergoing left colonic resection.

268 patient candidates to left colonic resection were randomly assigned to LPS (n=134) or open (n=134) approach. Postoperative care protocol was the same in both groups. Trained members of the surgical staff who were not involved in the study registered 30-day postoperative morbidity. Cost-benefit analysis was based on hospital costs. Long-term morbidity, quality of life, and 5-year survival have also been evaluated.

PROCEDURE: laparoscopic left colonic resection|PROCEDURE: open left colonic resection
short-term morbidity rate, 30 days
long-term outcome, 5 years
The study design was explained to the potential participants who were asked to sign a written informed consent before randomization.

Eligible patients were randomly allocated to LPS or open surgery. Randomization list was computer generated. Assignments were made by means of sealed sequenced masked envelopes which were opened, before the induction of anesthesia, by a nurse unaware of the trial design.
