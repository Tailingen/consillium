A US Study to Evaluate Transarterial Radioembolization (TARE) in Combination With Durvalumab and Bevacizumab Therapy in People With Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma Amenable to TARE
The purpose of this study is to measure the efficacy and safety of durvalumab intravenous (IV) solution plus bevacizumab IV solution after transarterial radioembolization (Yttrium 90 glass microspheres TARE) in participants with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) amenable to embolization.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)
DRUG: Durvalumab|DRUG: Bevacizumab|PROCEDURE: Transarterial Radioembolization (TARE)
Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from Day 1 (day of TARE) until the date of progressive disease per modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST), as assessed by the investigator, or death due to any cause. It is measured to assess the efficacy of TARE followed by durvalumab monotherapy followed by durvalumab + bevacizumab in participants with unresectable HCC amenable to locoregional therapy., From Day 1 until date of progressive disease or death [Approximately 3 years]
Number of participants with Adverse events (AEs), To assess the safety of the sequence of TARE followed by durvalumab monotherapy followed by durvalumab + bevacizumab in participants with unresectable HCC amenable to locoregional therapy, From Screening (Day -28 to Day 1) until 90 days after the last dose of study drug|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of participants who have a confirmed complete response or partial response, as determined by the investigator per mRECIST. It is assessed after TARE followed by durvalumab monotherapy followed by durvalumab + bevacizumab in participants with unresectable HCC amenable to locoregional therapy., From Day 1 until progression, or the last evaluable assessment in the absence of progression (Approximately 3 years)|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the start of TARE until the date of death due to any cause. It is assessed after TARE followed by durvalumab monotherapy followed by durvalumab + bevacizumab in participants with unresectable HCC amenable to locoregional therapy., Day 1 to 18 months or until death (Approximately 3 years)|Duration of Response (DoR), DoR is defined as the time from the date of first documented response until the date of documented progression per mRECIST as assessed by the investigator, or death due to any cause. It is assessed after TARE followed by durvalumab monotherapy followed by durvalumab + bevacizumab in participants with unresectable HCC amenable to locoregional therapy., Time from first documented response until documented progression (Approximately 3 years)
A Phase II single-arm study conducted in participants with unresectable Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) eligible for embolization and not eligible for or who have declined treatment with resection and/or ablation or liver transplant.

Participants with previous Transarterial Chemoembolization (TACE) or TARE associated with the curative setting are permitted with a 6-month washout.

Approximately 125 participants with unresectable but amenable to locoregional therapy HCC eligible for embolization will be enrolled in the study at approximately 20 sites in the US to treat approximately 100 participants.
