Registry Measuring Impact of RNA Expression Testing on Treatment Decisions in Early Stage Lung Cancer and Assessing the Disease-free Survival With Long-term Follow-up (ONC006)
This registry is intended to measure the effect of myPlan Lung Cancer™ test has on influencing treatment decisions of Oncologists when added to standard clinical-pathological parameters in patients with early stage NSCLC.

The sponsor is conducting two parallel registries, with one directed at Surgeons (ONC003) and the other at Oncologists (ONC006). This registry is specific to Oncologists (ONC006).
Lung Cancer|NSCLC|NSCLC Adenocarcinoma
Percentage change from Pre-Test treatment recommendation to Post-test treatment initiated, The percentage change from the recorded Pre-Test treatment recommendation by the oncologist versus the Post-Test treatment initiated., 3 months
Assessment of disease free survival from resection to relapse or death, To estimate disease-free survival with the collection of long-term follow-up information (up to 3 years post-testing)., 3 years
