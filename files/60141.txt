Neo-adjuvant Erbitux-based Chemotherapy for Locally Advanced Oral/Oropharyngeal Cancer
Epidermal growth factor receptor（EGFR） is a potential target for new anticancer therapy in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, because blocking the EGFR by a monoclonal antibody results in inhibition of the stimulation of the receptor, therefore, in inhibition of cell proliferation, enhanced apoptosis, and reduced angiogenesis, invasiveness and metastases. The study hypothesis is that neo-adjuvant Erbitux-based chemotherapy followed by surgery and radiotherapy for locally advanced oral/oropharyngeal cancer could benefit the patients on prognosis. The endpoints of this study are the pathological complete response after neo-adjuvant Erbitux-based chemotherapy followed by surgery and radiotherapy, the survival rate, and the safety.
Locally Advanced Malignant Neoplasm|Oral Cancer|Oropharyngeal Carcinoma
DRUG: Neo-adjuvant Erbitux-based chemotherapy
Pathological Complete Response, To evaluate pathological Complete Response (pCR) after neo-adjuvant Erbitux-based chemotherapy followed by surgery and radiotherapy., Up to 6 months
Disease Free Survival, Disease Free Survival (DFS) rates (1, 2, 3, 5 years), 5 years|Locoregional Control rates, Locoregional Control rates (LCR) (1, 3, 5 years), 5 years|Overall Survival, Overall Survival (OS) rate (3, 5 years), 5 years
The primary endpoint of this study is the pathological complete response after neo-adjuvant Erbitux-based chemotherapy followed by surgery and radiotherapy. The second endpoint of this study is the disease free survival rates (1, 2, 3, 5 years), locoregional control rates (1, 3, 5 years), overall survival rate (3, 5 years), and the safety.
