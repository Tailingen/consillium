Soy Isoflavones Supplementation in Treating Women at High Risk For or With Breast Cancer
RATIONALE: Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs to keep cancer from forming. The use of soy isoflavones supplements may prevent or treat early stage breast cancer. PURPOSE: This clinical trial studies soy isoflavones supplementation in treating women at high risk for or with breast cancer.

DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: soy isoflavones|OTHER: placebo|OTHER: questionnaire administration|PROCEDURE: magnetic resonance imaging|PROCEDURE: biopsy|OTHER: immunohistochemistry staining method|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis|PROCEDURE: mammography
Number of participants with reduced MRI volume (MRIV), At completion of 12 months on the study
Percentage of cells that stain positive for Ki67, caspase 3, ratio of Ki67/caspase, ER alpha and ER beta, At completion of 12 months on the study
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volume (equivalent to 3-dimensional mammographic density) is reduced in high-risk women or those with invasive breast cancer or DCIS who are supplemented daily with soy (5p mg total isoflavones as aglycone) compared to placebo (microcrystalline cellulose) tablets for 1 year.II. To assess whether cell proliferation and apoptosis, as measured by Ki67 and caspase 3 staining, respectively, of breast epithelial cells is altered with soy treatment.SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess whether other intermediate molecular markers including estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha) and ER beta differ between women supplemented with soy vs placebo. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.ARM I: Patients receive oral soy isoflavones supplement once daily for12 months in the absence of disease progression.ARM II: Patients receive oral placebo once daily for 12 months in the absence of disease progression.
