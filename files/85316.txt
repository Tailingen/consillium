This is an open-label, Phase 1/2, first-in-human (FIH), multiple ascending dose and dose-expansion study of BIO-106 administered as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab. Phase 1 will define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of BIO-106 that can be advanced to Phase 2. Phase 2 will define the preliminary efficacy of these regimens in the setting of advanced solid tumors with high unmet medical needs.
