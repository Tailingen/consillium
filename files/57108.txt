Study of SBP-101 Combined With Nab-Paclitaxel and Gemcitabine in Pancreatic Cancer
This is an open-label phase 1A/1B study to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of SBP-101 when combined with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine in subjects with previously untreated metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and to identify a recommended phase 2 dose. The study will also assess preliminary efficacy of the 3-drug treatment combination.
Pancreatic Cancer Metastatic|Pancreatic Cancer Stage IV|Stage IV Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: SBP-101|DRUG: nab-paclitaxel|DRUG: Gemcitabine Injection
Recommended dose of SBP-101, Up to 12 months following the first dose of treatment
Number of subjects with adverse events as a measure of safety and tolerability, Up to 24 months following the first dose of treatment|Tumor response will be evaluated on RECIST definitions, Every 8 weeks during treatment assessed up to 24 months|Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) for all three drugs, Day 1 of Cycle 1|Peak plasma concentration (Cmax) for all three drugs, Day 1 of Cycle 1
The study will be conducted in two phases: dose escalation and expansion. Up to three dose levels of SBP-101 will be assessed in up to 18 subjects during dose escalation. The expansion phase of the study will consist of 10 additional subjects who will receive the recommended dose of SBP-101 combined with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine.
