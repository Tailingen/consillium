Preliminary Results for the Double-dose Adenovirus-mediated Adjuvant Therapy Improving Outcome of Liver Transplantation in Patients With Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma
HCC patients with tumors \>5 cm in diameter, regardless of involvement in the intrahepatic and extrahepatic portal branches participated in the study. Patients were randomized allocated in liver transplantation (LT) only group and LT plus ADV-TK therapy group. All patients received orthotopic liver transplantation; in the LT plus ADV-TK group, ADV-TK therapy was delivered to patients twice.
