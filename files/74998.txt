Dendritic Killer Cell-based Immunotherapy for Solid Tumors
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of autologous dendritic killer cell (DKC) in patients with metastatic solid tumor and to evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of DKC. The primary endpoint of safety evaluation includes physical examination, assessment of vital sign, laboratory test, concomitant medication, and adverse event (AE). The secondary endpoints regarding efficacy includes the generation of tumor specific immune response by detecting CD3+ CD8+ CD69+ IFN-gamma+ T cells, and the improvement of quality of life

Safety of DKC as assessed by adverse event (AE), The coding system used for AE is MedDRA. Only treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are considered for primary endpoint. Frequency table of subjects with pre-treatment and treatment-emergent AE are presented by each cohort and overall trial. AE incidents are summarized descriptively by system organ class and preferred term using MedDRA for each cohort and overall trial., Entire treatment period (cycle 1-5, 116 +/- 4 days) and follow-up period (452 +/- 4 days)|Safety of DKC as assessed by serious adverse event (SAE), Serious adverse event incidence is summarized descriptively by system organ class and preferred term for each cohort and overall trial. The causality of SAEs will be assessed by the principal investigator for its relationship to study medication., Entire treatment period (cycle 1-5, 116 +/- 4 days) and follow-up period (452 +/- 4 days)|Safety of DKC as assessed by dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), DLT is defined as Grade ≧ 3 (according to NCI-CTCAE 4.03 grading system), study medication-related (i.e. with causality determined as at least possibly related to study medication), and worsened in comparison to baseline (pre-treatment condition). DLT is determined after first infusion cycle and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined as the highest dose without DLT. DLT is defined by the items listed below:

Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Grade ≧ 3 of (1) Any febrile neutropenia, (2) Leukocytosis, (3) Anemia

Other disorders: Grade ≧ 3 of (1) Diarrhea, (2) Vomiting, (3) Fever, (4) Nausea, (5) Anaphylaxis, Entire treatment period (cycle 1-5, 116 +/- 4 days) and follow-up period (452 +/- 4 days)|Safety of DKC as assessed by combining with concomitant anticancer treatment, The subjects enrolled in the study are cancer patients, who were treated with anticancer drugs before, and possibly during, DKC immunotherapy. Potential adverse drug-drug interaction (DDI) is monitored during treatment and follow-up period., Entire treatment period (cycle 1-5, 116 +/- 4 days) and follow-up period (452 +/- 4 days)|Safety of DKC as assessed by laboratory examinations, For each cohort, there are 5 baselines (taken 9 days before infusion) for 5 infusion cycles, and there are 2 evaluation time points in each infusion cycle (at end of first week and second week after infusion) and 4 in the follow-up period (at every 12 weeks). The laboratory evaluation results are tabulated in two aspects: 1) the percentage changes between each evaluation and corresponding baselines, and 2) the mean baseline values of each cycle in each cohort. Laboratory results regarding different functional categories are described separately in following areas.

Hematology related items: Hb (g/dL), WBC (count/uL), Platelet (x 10\^3 count/uL), ANC (count/uL)

Liver function related items: C-RP (mg/dL), Glucose AC (mg/dL), Total Bilirubin (mg/dL), AST (U/L), ALT (U/L), LDH (U/L), ALP (U/L), gammaGT (U/L)

Serum lipids and proteins, renal function, and electrolytes related items: HDL-C (mg/dL), Total Cholesterol (mg/dL), Triglyceride (mg/dL), Creatinine (mg/dL), BUN (mg/dL), Entire treatment period (cycle 1-5, 116 +/- 4 days) and follow-up period (452 +/- 4 days)
Efficacy of DKC as assessed by tumor specific T cell response, The tumor specific T cell response was assessed by the detection of CD3+CD8+CD69+IFN-gamma+ T lymphocytes in percentage relative to total peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Baseline value was measured before first infusion cycle, and subsequent evaluation time points were measured right after infusion cycles 2, 3, and 4., Entire treatment period (cycle 1-5, 116 +/- 4 days)|Efficacy of DKC as assessed by change in quality of life, The quality of life as assessed by the WHO QoL-BREF questionnaire, and the transformed scores (0-100) was used to facilitate the interpretation. Baseline value was measured before first infusion cycle, and evaluation time points were taken right after infusion cycles 2, 3, 4, and 5. During the follow-up period, evaluation time points were taken at every 12 weeks for a total of 4 time points., Entire treatment period (cycle 1-5, 116 +/- 4 days) and follow-up period (452 +/- 4 days)
