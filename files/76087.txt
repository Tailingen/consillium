Specific Molecular Signatures Predict Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Response in Cervical Cancer
Cervical cancer is one of the major health problems for chinese women. Besides surgery and radiotherapy, neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been proved to be an effective program by many studies.

However, not all patients respond well to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Knowing the therapeutic effect of the neoadjuvant chemotherapy before receiving it can not only reduce the economic burden, but also more importantly save time to take more suitable treatments.

This study is undertaken to build specific molecular signatures to predict the effects of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

The clinical response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, clinical response（tumor size）, 1 to 3 months
The pathological response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, pathological response（\<3 mm or not）, 1 to 3 months
