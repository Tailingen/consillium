TPC VS. GP Induced Chemotherapy Combined With Nimotuzumab and Toripalimab in the Treatment of Locally Advanced Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
We expect to conduct a clinical trial in high-risk locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients to explore the efficacy and safety of sequential radical radiotherapy treatment after induction chemotherapy (TPC vs. GP) with combination therapy of nivolumab and triprolizumab.
