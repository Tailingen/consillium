Redirected HBV-Specific T Cells in Patients With HBV-related HCC (SAFE-T-HBV)
This is a single center, single arm and open-label study to determine the safety of mRNA modified HBV-TCR redirected T-cells and to analyze the changes in tumor microenvironment caused by these HBV-TCR redirected T-cells in subjects with HBV-related HCC who are not amenable to/failed conventional treatment.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
