Mosunetuzumab Consolidation Therapy After autoSCT in r/r Aggressive B Cell Lymphoma
This phase 1 pilot study examines the feasibility and safety of mosunetuzumab after autologous stem cell transplant for patients with aggressive B cell lymphomas. Mosunetuzumab is an antibody that has been engineered to attach to two target cells in the immune system: T cells that normally perform tasks like killing virus-infected cells, and cancerous B cells. Mosunetuzumab has been designed to direct these T cells to kill the cancerous B cells instead.

Frequencies and grades of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) are defined as adverse events possibly, probably, or definitely related to mosunetuzumab that occur on or after first dose of study treatment., Evaluated from start of study treatment through 30 days after last dose of mosunetuzumab, study discontinuation/termination, or until initiation of alternate treatment for lymphoma, whichever occurs earlier (estimated to be 7 months)|Rate of treatment discontinuation due to treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) are defined as adverse events possibly, probably, or definitely related to mosunetuzumab that occur on or after first dose of study treatment., Evaluated from start of study treatment through 30 days after last dose of mosunetuzumab, study discontinuation/termination, or until initiation of alternate treatment for lymphoma, whichever occurs earlier (estimated to be 7 months)|Percentage of consented and enrolled patients completing at least 2 cycles of mosunetuzumab consolidation, Patients are consented and enrolled prior to autoSCT, and given the long delay from consent to treatment, this will allow evaluation of feasibility of this approach., Evaluated from time of consent to completion of cycle 2 (each cycle is 21 days) of mosunetuzumab (estimated to be 13 weeks).
Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from day zero of autologous stem cell transplantation to the first occurrence of disease progression as determined by the investigator with use of the Lugano Response Criteria or death from any cause., At 1 year post-autoSCT (estimated to be 1 year and 7 weeks).|Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from day zero of autologous stem cell transplantation to the first occurrence of disease progression as determined by the investigator with use of the Lugano Response Criteria or death from any cause., At 2 years post-autoSCT (estimated to be 2 years and 7 weeks).|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from day zero of autologous stem cell transplantation to death from any cause., At 1 year post-autoSCT (estimated to be 1 year and 7 weeks).|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from day zero of autologous stem cell transplantation to death from any cause., At 2 years post-autoSCT (estimated to be 2 years and 7 weeks).|Percentage of patients requiring any tocilizumab doses for management of cytokine release syndrome (CRS), Tocilizumab is recommended for treatment of grade 2 CRS and required for grade 3 or 4 CRS. Tocilizumab should be administered by IV infusion for a maximum of 4 doses., Up to approximately 6 months|Number of tocilizumab doses per patient for management of cytokine release syndrome (CRS), Tocilizumab is recommended for treatment of grade 2 CRS and required for grade 3 or 4 CRS. Tocilizumab should be administered by IV infusion for a maximum of 4 doses., Up to approximately 6 months
