HCQ+ADC vs ADC in the Treatment of Advanced Breast Cancer
Advanced breast cancer is a special subtype of human breast cancer. Conventional guidelines recommend chemotherapy combined with other adjuvant therapies for this subtype of patients. However, the choice of treatment for these patients after treatment progress is a research hotspot in this field. Trastuzumab Deruxtecan (T-DXd) and Sacituzumab Govitecan (SG) are new ADC drugs targeting HER2 or TROP-2 with high efficacy and low toxicity after the progress of first-line treatment. The autophagy agents hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine has become the only FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved autophagy inhibitor, and hydroxychloroquine and antibody-drug conjugate(ADC) may have synergistic effects based on the previous work results of our research group.

Therefore,we envisage that Trastuzumab Deruxtecan(T-DXd) or Sacituzumab Govitecan (SG) combined with hydroxychloroquine(HCQ) in the treatment of advanced breast cancer in clinical practice has the advantages of improving efficacy and survival.

To this end, we intend to conduct a prospective,multi-center, phase I/II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of T-DXd or SG in combination with HCQ in patients with advacned breast cancer.

Dose Limiting Toxicity, DLT, A dose limiting toxicity（DLT）is defined as any of the following-related adverse event(AE) that occurs during the DLT period, graded according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events(CTCAE), Version 5.0, 3 weeks|Adverse event, AE, Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment., 2 years|Objective Response Rate, ORR, the proportion of patients with a tumor volume reduction of ≥30% and a minimum timeframe according to accepted response evaluation criteria (e.g., RECIST version 1.1 in solid tumors), including cases of complete response (CR) and partial response (PR)., 2 years
Progression-Free Survival, PFS, The time from the beginning of treatment to the progression or death of the patient, 2 years|Overall Survival, OS, The time from the start of randomization to death due to any cause., 4 years|Clinical Benefit Rate, CBR, Proportion of confirmed complete response, partial response, or stable disease ≥ 24 weeks., 24 weeks after enrollment|Disease Control Rate, DCR, Proportion of patients with stable or shrinking tumor size--sum of the proportions of complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR) and stable disease (SD)., 2 years|The rate of adverse events, The probability and severity of adverse reactions were analyzed up to 24 weeks after enrollment, up to 24 weeks after enrollment|Quality of life scale score, QoL, The quality of life score of patients during treatment was analyzed(FACT-B). Performance Status Rating (PSR) was demonstrated for the FACT-B total score, which is the result of the following subscale scores: SWB (the Social / family Well-Being subscale) , EWB (the Emotional Well-Being subscale), AC (Additional Concerns subscale), PWB (the Physical Well-Being subscale), FWB (the Functional Well-Being subscale), 1 year|Exploration of biomarkers, Objective to explore the correlation between biomarkers and the ORR. The biomarkers will be test by nest-generation sequence, which include 520 genes and tumor mutation burden, like ERBB2/TP53/PIK3CA/ERBB4/CCND1 and so on., the first week after the enrollment
Breast cancer is the most prevalent malignant tumor in the world, and 30% of breast cancer patients will enter the advanced stage due to treatment failure. Most patients with advanced breast cancer have had distant organ metastasis, and the median progression free survival period is only 1-2 years.

In the past, advanced breast cancer patients faced the dilemma of poor survival due to the lack of precise targeted therapy. However, through a series of clinical studies, experts in the field of advanced breast cancer have successfully expanded the indications of ADC-based combination targeted therapy from the emergence of first generation ADC to the third generation ADC with "bystander effect", which has significantly prolonged the survival time of patients. Trastuzumab Deruxtecan (T-DXd) and Sacituzumab Govitecan (SG) are new ADC drugs targeting HER2 or TROP-2 with high efficacy and low toxicity after the progress of first-line treatment.

Because both ADC and autophagy involve lysosomes, and the relationship between ADC and autophagy microenvironment has not been elucidated, the combination of autophagy regulators and ADC may be a treatment option that can benefit some patients more.The autophagy agents hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine has become the only FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved autophagy inhibitor. And the synergistic effect of hydroxychloroquine and antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) has already been confirmed based on preliminary experiments of our research group. We envisage that Trastuzumab Deruxtecan (T-DXd) or Sacituzumab Govitecan (SG) combined with hydroxychloroquine(HCQ) in the treatment of advanced breast cancer in clinical practice has the advantages of improving efficacy and survival.

Therefore, we intend to further validate the efficacy and safety of the Autophagy inhibitor hydroxychloroquine(HCQ) in combination with the latest ADC drugs (T-DXd or SG) in a Phase I/II, randomized, controlled clinical study, in order to provide advanced breast cancer patients with a better choice of precision targeted therapy.
