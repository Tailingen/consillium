A Study of the Safety of Subcutaneously Administered Trastuzumab (Herceptin) in Participants With Early and Locally Advanced Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2)-Positive Breast Cancer
This non-randomized, multicenter, open-label study will assess the safety and efficacy of subcutaneously administered trastuzumab in participants with early and locally advanced HER2-positive breast cancer in two sequential cohorts. First 120 participants will be treated with subcutaneous (SC) trastuzumab 600 milligrams (mg) vial (Cohort A) and the subsequent 120 participants will be treated with SC trastuzumab prefilled single use injection device (SID) (Cohort B). Participants from each cohort will receive neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of doxorubicin every 3 weeks (q3w) (1 cycle) for 4 cycles followed by paclitaxel weekly or docetaxel every 3 weeks (q3w) in combination with SC trastuzumab (600 mg) q3w for 4 cycles and a further 14 cycles of SC trastuzumab (600 mg) q3w alone. All participants will be followed up for 24 months after the last participant has received the last dose of study treatment, or earlier in case of withdrawal from the study, loss to follow-up or death.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Doxorubicin|DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Trastuzumab
Percentage of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. TEAEs were the AEs occurring from starting on the day of or after first administration of trastuzumab and within 28 days after last dose of trastuzumab. Data for this outcome measure were analyzed and reported by adjuvant versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy groups within each treatment arm., Day 1 up to 28 days after last dose of trastuzumab (up to approximately 1 year)
Actual Dose of Trastuzumab Administered, Actual dose (mg) administered = (sum over all cycles of actual dose received \[mg\] divided by number of cycles). Data for this outcome measure were analyzed and reported by adjuvant versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy groups within each treatment arm., Day 1 up last dose of trastuzumab (up to approximately 1 year)|Duration of Treatment With Trastuzumab, Data for this outcome measure were analyzed and reported by adjuvant versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy groups within each treatment arm., Day 1 up last dose of trastuzumab (up to approximately 1 year)|Percentage of Participants Who Received Concomitant Medications, Screening (Day -28 to -1) up to 2.5 years|Percentage of Participants With Pathological Complete Response (pCR) (Neoadjuvant Groups Only) Using Mammography, In the neoadjuvant setting, the activity of two sequential drug regimens, doxorubicin-containing chemotherapy followed by paclitaxel or docetaxel chemotherapy in combination with trastuzumab, was assessed as the percentage of participants with pCR in breast and nodes using mammography. pCR was defined as the absence of histological evidence of invasive breast cancer cells in the tissue specimen removed from the breast after preoperative treatment. Data for this outcome measure were analyzed and reported only for neoadjuvant groups within each treatment arm., Day 1 up to 24 weeks|Percentage of Participants With Event (Local, Regional or Distant Recurrence, Contralateral Breast Cancer or Death) Using Mammography, A participant was considered as disease free if the participant was free from local, regional or distant recurrence, contralateral breast cancer or death due to any cause (whichever occurred first). Percentage of participants with event at the cut off date were reported. Data for this outcome measure were analyzed and reported by adjuvant versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy groups within each treatment arm., Day 1 up to local, regional or distant recurrence, contralateral breast cancer or death due to any cause (whichever occurred first [up to approximately 4.5 years])|Disease-Free Survival (DFS) Using Mammography, DFS was defined as the time from the first treatment to local, regional or distant recurrence, contralateral breast cancer or death due to any cause (whichever occurred first). Kaplan-Meier estimates were used for analysis. Participants who were disease-free were censored at the data cut off date. Data for this outcome measure were analyzed and reported by adjuvant versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy groups within each treatment arm., Day 1 up to local, regional or distant recurrence, contralateral breast cancer or death due to any cause (whichever occurred first [up to approximately 4.5 years])|Percentage of Participants Who Died, Data for this outcome measure were analyzed and reported by adjuvant versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy groups within each treatment arm., Day 1 up to death due to any cause (up to approximately 4.5 years)|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival was defined as the time from the first treatment to death from any cause. Kaplan-Meier estimates were used for analysis. Participants who did not die were censored on the date they were last known to be alive. Data for this outcome measure were analyzed and reported by adjuvant versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy groups within each treatment arm., Day 1 up to death due to any cause (up to approximately 4.5 years)|Percentage of Participants by Response to Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ), Participants were asked the following 5 questions: (1) "Following the first injection given by the physician/nurse and training on how to use the SID, I felt comfortable injecting the study drug by myself"; (2) "The SID was convenient and easy to use"; (3) "I am confident giving myself an injection in the thigh with the SID"; (4) "Taking all things into account, I find self-administration using the SID satisfactory"; (5) "If given the opportunity, I would choose to continue self-injecting the study drug using the SID at home". Response to each question was recorded as either of the following options: "Unknown", "Strongly Disagree", "Disagree", "Unsure", "Agree", "Strongly Agree". Percentage of participants who provided responses to above questions was reported. Data for this outcome measure were analyzed and reported only for Trastuzumab (SID) arm., After at least 14 cycles (1 cycle = 21 days; maximum up to 1 year)|Percentage of Health Care Professionals (HCPs) by Response to Health Care Professional Questionnaire (HCPQ), Percentage of HCPs providing responses to various questions related to overall ease of study drug administration was reported in different categories, where categories indicate all possible responses to such questions., After at least 4 participants completed 5 cycles of adjuvant treatment (1 cycle = 21 daysÍ¾ maximum up to 1 year)
