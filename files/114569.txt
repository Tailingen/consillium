Pain Outcomes Following Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgery (VATS) With LAP Protector
The purpose of this study is to see if different types of spreading (rigid or soft) of Video-assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS) for lung cancer have different effects on pain.
Lung Cancer
DEVICE: LAP Protector
Compare the level of postoperative pain between the rigid and soft spreading groups, The level of postoperative pain was measured by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)., 1 day
Compare early postoperative analgesic requirements between the rigid and soft spreading groups, Postoperative analgesic requirements (e.g. the amount of morphine titration)., 1 week
The Lap-Protector (Hakko Co., Japan) is a device that consists of two flexible rings made of superelasticity alloys covered with polyurethane polyamide, and a thin silicone rubber membrane that is attached to the outer rim of the two rings. If the two rings are pulled apart, the device assumes a cylindrical shape. The outer diameter of each flexible ring is 12 cm, and this device can be used for minilaparotomy wounds between 5 and 9cm long.
