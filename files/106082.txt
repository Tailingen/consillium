Cyclophosphamide as Sole Graft-Versus-Host-Prophylaxis After Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation
A phase II clinical study to assess the efficacy of post-transplantation cyclophosphamide as single-agent GvHD prophylaxis after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with multiple myeloma or lymphoma and to describe the influence of the modified immunosuppression concept on relapse rates, minimal residual disease, immune reconstitution and chimerism.
Multiple Myeloma|Non-Hodgkin-Lymphoma|Hodgkin's Disease
DRUG: Cyclophosphamide
Number of patients not requiring additional immunosuppression, The primary endpoint is met if at least 1 of the 5 first patients and 3 of a total of 11 patient will reach day 100 after transplant without additional immunsuppressive drug treatment, day 100 after transplant
