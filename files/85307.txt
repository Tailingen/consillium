Oncology Care at Home for BMT and CAR-T
To assess the potential for successfully using technology-assisted in-home oncology care to provide improved care coordination and management, and appropriate referral to treatment for patients receiving bone marrow transplant (BMT) or chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy (CAR-T). The technology-assisted in-home oncology care program includes remote patient monitoring (RPM), telemedicine, and home-based health care services.

The objective of this study is to assess the potential for successfully using technology-assisted in-home oncology care to provide improved care coordination and management, and appropriate referral to treatment for patients receiving bone marrow transplant (BMT) or chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy (CAR-T). The technology-assisted in-home oncology care program includes remote patient monitoring (RPM), telemedicine, and home-based health care services.

The study focuses on evaluating the technical feasibility, operational feasibility, and perceived patient, caregiver and healthcare provider experience of a combined package of technology-assisted in-home oncology care services to monitor for febrile neutropenia, infection, cyotokine release syndrome, neurotoxicity or other symptomatic episodes needing management up to 90 days post allogeneic BMT, up to 30 days post autologous BMT, and up to 30 days post CAR-T. It includes the following specific aims and hypotheses:
