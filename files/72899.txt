Study of the Clinical Utility of PSMA Imaging in the Evaluation of Men With Prostate Cancer
In this study we aim to more precisely define the clinical utility of PSMA imaging across a range of clinical indications in men with prostate cancer. To accomplish this, we will make the 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT scan available to urologists, medical oncologists, and radiation oncologists at Johns Hopkins and survey physicians as to the indication for ordering the PET/CT and if a change in management occurred as the result of new information gained from the scan. We believe these data will prove critical for planning future studies aimed at evaluating the efficacy of this test for improving patient outcomes.
