Study of Vorinostat Plus Capecitabine (X) and Cisplatin (P) for 1st Line Treatment of Metastatic or Recurrent Gastric Cancer: Zolinza+XP
There is scientific rationale for exploring the role of vorinostat, histone deacetylase inhibitor with capecitabine (X) and cisplatin (P), one of standard chemotherapy in patients with advanced gastric cancer. XP is a new standard of care in advanced gastric cancer (AGC) and vorinostat is a novel targeted agent that prevents tumor cell proliferation, survival and angiogenesis through histone deacetylase inhibition.
