Vorinostat (SAHA) in Uterine Sarcoma
Uterine sarcomas are rare tumors with a poor prognosis.

The main purpose of this phase II proof-of-principle- pilot study is to test the efficacy of the hydroxamic acid-based Histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI) Vorinostat (SAHA) as monotherapy in patients with HDAC-positive, progressive, metastatic uterine sarcomas and mixed epithelial and mesenchymal tumors after prior anti-proliferative therapy.

DRUG: Vorinostat Oral Capsule
Progression-free Survival (PFS), Change from Baseline Tumor Size to last available observation with respect to progress as defined by RECIST 1.1 (CT-Scan every 12 weeks up to 9 months), 9 months
Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (Safety and Tolerability), This endpoint is evaluated by the amount of clinical adverse experiences., 9 months
This is an open-label, single arm, proof of concept-study of the HDAC-inhibitor vorinostat in patients with refractory uterine sarcoma that have been pre-tested for an high expression of HDAC. Patients will receive Vorinostat, 400 mg (4 capsules รก 100mg of Zolinza) orally once daily for the first 14 days of a 21 day cycle. Treatment will be continued for 4 cycles (treatment period 1). Patients with a response or stable disease after 4 cycles as determined by computed tomography (CT) of target an non target-lesions will be continued on vorinostat therapy at the tolerated schedule and dosage until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or patients' withdrawal of the consent. At the maximum, a total of 12 cycles will be administered over a 9 months period (treatment periods 2 and 3).
