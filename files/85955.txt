Reconstruction With a Lawrence-Hunt Jejunal Pouch After Total Gastrectomy
The aim of the study is to establish the efficacy of jejunal pouch reconstruction in reducing dumping syndrome in patients undergoing total gastrectomy, ultimately enhancing postoperative quality of life and nutritional status.
Total Gastrectomy|Gastric Cancer
PROCEDURE: Jejunal Pouch reconstruction.
Dumping syndrome reduction rate, Evaluate the reduction in the incidence of dumping syndrome after TG with JP reconstruction with the Sigstad questionnaire., 12 months after surgery
Dumping syndrome severity, Assess the severity of dumping syndrome with the Arts Dumping Severity Score (DSS) questionnaire, 3, 6 & 12 months after surgery|Nutritional status - weight, Assess the nutritional status using weight in kilograms, 3, 6 & 12 months after surgery|Nutritional status - height, Assess the nutritional status using height in meters, 3, 6 & 12 months after surgery|Nutritional status - Body Mass Index (BMI), To Assess the nutritional status weight and height will be combined to report BMI in kg/m\^2, 3, 6 & 12 months after surgery|Nutritional status, Assess the nutritional status using validated metrics such as the serum iron levels, albumin levels, B12 levels and vitamin D levels., 3, 6 & 12 months after surgery|Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI), Evaluate the quality of life using using the Italian versions of the GIQLI questionnaire. The maximum GIQLI in the international score is 144 and its worst value is 0., 3, 6 & 12 months after surgery|EORTC QLQ-C30, Evaluate the quality of life using using the Italian versions of the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. The EORTC QLG Core Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) is a 30 item instrument meant to assess some of the different aspects that define the quality of life of cancer patients., 3, 6 & 12 months after surgery|Postoperative complications, Measure the rate of postoperative complications. All severe adverse events (SAEs) will be collected starting with the surgical admission until the end of the study period (12 months)., 12 months after surgery
Total gastrectomy (TG) with Roux-en-Y (RY) esophageal-jejunal anastomosis is performed for various gastric malignancies or as a prophylactic strategy in patients with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer syndrome harboring CDH1 mutation at risk of developing gastric cancer. The surgical procedure is, however, complicated in the post-operative months by weight loss and nutritional deficiency in most patients, requiring frequent follow-up, and by functional issues such as reflux and dumping syndrome in about 30% of cases, which significantly impact the patient's quality of life. To prevent the poorer outcomes reported by patients undergoing total gastrectomy, one strategy could be a modification of the reconstruction method using a jejunal pouch reconstruction (JP) that may mitigate symptoms by slowing gastric emptying and enhancing nutrient absorption. JP has so far proven several benefits in improving postoperative outcomes (reflux and dumping syndrome), nutritional outcomes, and QoL up to 2 years after surgery. The technique has been mostly studied in the Eastern countries (Japan and South Korea) and, since 2021, has been recommended by the French Association of Surgery as the technique of choice for reconstruction after total gastrectomy. However, in most European centers, this technique has not yet been introduced as a routine procedure due to a relative lack of data on the clinical benefit and risk profile in the Western population.
