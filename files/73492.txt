Collection of Endometrial Cancer-derived Organoids to Evaluate the Efficacy of PARP Inhibitors: PENDOR Pilot Study
This study comprises 3 stages:

1. Collection of tumor and blood samples.
2. Creation of organoid models based on tumor samples.
3. Development of functional tests to predict clinical response to treatment.
