Safety Study of SLC-0111 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumours
SLC-0111 is a selective, small molecule, inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase (CA) IX and is in development for the treatment of solid tumours over-expressing CA IX. CAIX, a transmembrane metalloenzyme, is overexpressed on extracellular surfaces of hypoxic tumour cells but its expression is highly restricted in normal tissue. CAIX is a functional regulator of processes critical for tumour growth and metastasis, including pH regulation, survival, migration and invasion.

This prospective single arm study will evaluate the safety of SLC-0111 given once daily in 28 day cycles in subjects with advanced solid tumours. The intent of this research study is to find our more information such as: the highest dose of SLC-0111 that can be given safely, the side effect it may cause, to examine how the body affects the study drug concentration in the blood (pharmacokinetics or PK), and to gain some information on its effectiveness in treating cancer.
