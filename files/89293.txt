Single Dose Ablative Radiation Treatment for Early-Stage Breast Cancer
The purpose of the study is to investigate the feasibility of a preoperative, single dose, ablative partial breast radiation treatment in patients with early-stage breast cancer.
Breast Neoplasm
RADIATION: Single dose ablative radiotherapy
Pathological complete response, 6 months after radiotherapy
Radiological tumor response on MRI according to the RECIST criteria, Within 1 week and 2, 4 and 6 months after radiotherapy|Radiological tumor response on FDG-PET-CT according to the PERCIST criteria, At 6 months after radiotherapy|Quality of life according to EORTC QLQ-BR23 and EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaires, Until 10 years after radiotherapy|Cosmetic results as assessed by patient questionnaire, radiation oncologist evaluation and BCCT.core software, Until 10 years after radiotherapy|Frailty assessment according to the Groningen Frailty Indicator, Until 10 years after radiotherapy|Functionality assessment using patient questionnaires on physical activity and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale questionnaire., Until 10 years after radiotherapy|Local relapse rates, Until 10 years after radiotherapy|Regional relapse rates, Until 10 years after radiotherapy|Distant relapse rates, Until 10 years after radiotherapy|Disease free survival, Until 10 years after radiotherapy|Overall survival, Until 10 years after radiotherapy
Tumor related genetic characteristics associated with radiotherapy responsiveness, Future research proposal performed within 10 years after radiotherapy, Until 10 years after radiotherapy
A total of twenty-five patients will be treated with a single dose preoperative ablative radiation treatment. After a vigilant follow-up with MRI, breast conserving surgery will be performed 6 months after the ablative radiation treatment. The total follow-up time is 10 years.

This study aims to present an ablative radiotherapy treatment approach that could resolve to some extent the disadvantages of current breast conserving treatment in elderly low-risk breast cancer patients who are currently not treated according to guidelines due to co-morbidity.
