HER-2 B Cell Peptide Vaccine
This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of vaccine therapy in treating patients with metastatic solid tumors. Vaccines made from antibodies and peptides combined with tumor cells may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells.

BIOLOGICAL: Combination of MVF-HER-2 (597-626) and MVF-HER-2 (266-296) emulsified with ISA 720
Evaluation of safety and toxicity at regular intervals by NCI common toxicity criteria 5.0, through study completion (i.e. up to 1 year post initial vaccine)|Humoral Immune Response, Humoral immune response will be measured by ELISA quantification of IgM and IgG antibodies to HER2 (597-626) and HER2 (266-296), through completion of 3 vaccine series (i.e. up to day 92 post final vaccine injection)|Overall Response Rate, through completion of 3 vaccine series (i.e. up to day 71)
immunogenicity, ELISA will be analyzed for immunogenicity at baseline, with every vaccine, 21 days after the final vaccine, 6 months from initial vaccination, and at 1 year from initial vaccination to describe time course of antibody production, through study completion (i.e. up to 1 year post initial vaccine)|T cell functionality, T cell functionality will be determined using proteomic profiling and immunophenotyping, through study completion (i.e. up to 1 year post initial vaccine)
