A Phase 1 Study of PLN-101095 in Adults With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1a/1b, dose-escalation/expansion, consecutive-cohort, open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and preliminary evidence of antitumor activity of PLN-101095 in combination with pembrolizumab (the study treatment regimen) in adult participants with advanced or metastatic solid tumors for which pembrolizumab is indicated but have documented disease progression (refractory \[primary resistance\]) or relapsed \[secondary resistance\]) after at least 3 months from the start of treatment with pembrolizumab.

The study will consist of 2 main parts:

* Part 1: Consecutive dose-escalation cohorts using a Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) dose escalation design
* Part 2: Dose-expansion cohorts using Simon's 2-stage design
Metastatic Solid Tumor
DRUG: PLN-101095|DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Proportion of participants with treatment-emergent adverse events and serious adverse events per CTCAE Version 5.0., Signing ICF until 16 weeks after end of study treatment regimen|Number of participants with a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) defined as toxicities that meet predefined severity criteria, assess as having a suspected relationship to study drug, unrelated to disease, inter-current illness, or concomitant medications., First dose to 35 days
