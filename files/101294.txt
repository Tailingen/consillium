This purpose of this trial is to show that the combination of Avastin and hormone therapy should be more effective than hormone therapy alone for the treatment of breast cancer.

The Percentage of Participants With Pathologic Complete Response, Pathological complete response is defined as the absence of residual invasive tumor in the breast or axillary lymph nodes or if only residual ductal carcinoma in-situ was seen on review of the surgical specimen., 24 weeks
Letrozole +Avastin, Radiographic objective response to the therapy are reported. Radiographic response was assessed using RECIST criteria by ultrasound or breast MRI through the study and are reported as complete radiographic response below., 24 weeks
Preclinical and clinical data have demonstrated that up-regulation of tumor cell VEGF is an important mechanism to subvert estrogen dependence in hormone responsive breast cancer resulting in reduced therapy response or tumor resistance to hormonal therapy; thus, it is hypothesized that the combination of an anti-VEGF agent (Avastin, an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody) and hormonal therapy should be more effective than hormonal therapy alone for the treatment of breast cancer.
