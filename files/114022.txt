A Clinical tRial of Endobronchial Ultrasound for the Diagnosis of MEDiastinal lymphadenopathY (REMEDY)
Enlarged glands in the chest (mediastinal lymphadenopathy) is a common problem and may have a variety of different causes. In the past an operation (mediastinoscopy) was required to diagnose the glands. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) is a new procedure that may be able to diagnose these glands without the need for mediastinoscopy. The REMEDY trial aims to examine whether EBUS can reduce the number of mediastinoscopies and healthcare costs in patients with enlarged glands in the chest.

Length of hospital stay, At diagnosis|Sensitivity and false negative rate of endobronchial ultrasound, At study completion
Although the literature is replete with data on the utility of Endobronchial Ultrasound for lung cancer, there are very few data available on its role in the diagnosis of isolated mediastinal lymphadenopathy due to other causes such as sarcoid, tuberculosis or lymphoma. The REMEDY trial aims to evaluate the accuracy of EBUS in this setting and assess any reduction in the number of mediastinoscopies and healthcare costs.
