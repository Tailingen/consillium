Study to Evaluate Safety and Preliminary Efficacy of Tafasitamab With Idelalisib or Venetoclax in R/R CLL/SLL Patients Pretreated With BTKi
This is a two-cohort, multicenter, open-label study of tafasitamab (MOR208) combined with idelalisib or venetoclax in adult patients with R/R CLL or R/R SLL pretreated with a BTK inhibitor (e.g., ibrutinib) as single agent or as part of combination therapy. Patients completing the study treatment are invited to participate in an optional biomarker sub-study.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical safety and preliminary efficacy of tafasitamab (MOR208) combined with idelalisib or venetoclax. The study will include safety run-in phase for each cohort with an evaluation of the safety data by an Independent Data Monitoring Committee.

An optional sub-study has been introduced to collect biological samples for investigations on biomarkers (e.g., CD19 expression) after tafasitamab treatment.
