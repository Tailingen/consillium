68Ga-PSMA PET/MRI in Conjunction With mpMRI for Evaluating Prospective Prostate Cancer Risk
The goal of this observational study is to learn if Ga-68 PSMA PET/MRI can better diagnose prostate cancer than mpMRI in males between 40 to 85 years old who is naive to prostate biopsy and is suspicious for prostate cancer by elevated PSA or lower urinary tract symptoms. The main questions it aims to answer are:

1. Does PSMA PET/MRI have better PPV and NPV than mpMRI to diagnose prostate cancer?
2. Does lesion location concordance in PSMA PET and MRI effect diagnosis accuracy?

Participants will:

1. Undergo a Ga-68 PSMA PET/MRI scan and keep followed up for 2 years to check if prostate cancer is diagnosed after the scan.
2. Between the follow-up period, visit the clinic once every 6 months for checkups and blood tests.
Prostate Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Ga-68 PSMA PET/MRI
PPV of concordant PET/MRI lesion plus PI-RADS score 4~5, Comparing positive predictive values (PPV) of using concordant PET/MRI lesion plus PI-RADS score 4\~5 as positive test with PPV of using PI-RADS 4\~5 alone as positive test to predict diagnosing prostate cancer within 2 years., 2 years after PSMA PET/MRI scan|NPV of using negative PET lesion plus PI-RADS score 1~3, Comparing negative predictive values (NPV) of using negative PET lesion plus PI-RADS score 1\~3 as negative test with NPV of using PI-RADS 1\~3 alone as negative test to predict diagnosing prostate cancer within 2 years., 2 years after PSMA PET/MRI scan
