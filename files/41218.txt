ADG116 in Combination With Pembrolizumab in Patients With Advanced/Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1b, open-label, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and immunogenicity of an ADG116-pembrolizumab combination regimen in patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumors. Study drug ADG116, is an anti -CTLA-4 fully human monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to human CTLA-4. Pembrolizumab is a PD-1 receptor-blocking antibody (a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody) which is indicated for the treatment of patients across a number of indications. The treatment strategy of using anti-PD 1 therapy combined with anti-CTLA-4 therapy is to explore the potential of combination checkpoint inhibition regimens for the enhanced antitumor efficacy results.
