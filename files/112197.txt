Development of a Personalised Therapeutic Approach for Cancer Patients With Resting Hypermetabolism
Half of all cancer patients show an increase in resting energy expenditure. The causes of hypermetabolism have only recently been investigated in cancerology. One established cause is inflammation, but other causes have yet to be identified.

The interest in hypermetabolism is due to the fact that it appears early, before the onset of clinical deterioration (weight loss, sarcopenia, altered performance status) and that it correlates with patient morbidity and mortality. Like the other parameters that make up cachexia, it is both a predictor of toxicity and reduced efficacy of anti-tumour treatments and a prognostic factor, regardless of the tumour.

A therapeutic goal is to correct hypermetabolism for two reasons:

* avoid progression to clinical cachexia, which is an independent cause of morbidity and mortality
* increase the efficacy of anti-PD1/PDL1 immunotherapies. This new class of therapy has revolutionised the therapeutic management of many cancers but is less effective in cases of inflammation and/or altered performance status and/or hypermetabolism.

Investigator hypothesises that it is possible to develop a patient-specific treatment to correct hypermetabolism, depending on the predominant clinical or biological cause.

OTHER: Multimodal intervention
Assess the impact at 1 month of a multimodal intervention on hypermetabolism in cancer patients compared to standard care, The impact of a multimodal intervention is evaluated by proportion of hypermetabolic patients at 1 month in the personalised multimodal intervention arm compared to patients in the standard care arm, 1 month after inclusion
