Clinical Study on the Efficacy of Single-port Inflatable Mediastinoscopy Combined With Laparoscopic-assisted Small Incision Surgery and Thoracoscopy Combined With Laparoscopic Surgery for Radical Esophagectomy
We previously developed a novel non-trans thoracic esophagectomy, the single-port inflatable mediastinoscopy combined with laparoscopy for the radical esophagectomy of esophageal cancer.This study is evaluating the feasibility and safety of radical resection of single-port inflatable mediastinal mirror synchronization with laparoscopic esophageal carcinoma, as well as the clinical value of the radical resection of single-port inflatable mediastinal mirror synchronization with laparoscopic esophageal carcinoma as a new minimally invasive operation for esophageal carcinoma.
Esophageal Cancer
PROCEDURE: Single-Port Inflatable Mediastinoscopy Combined With Laparoscopic-Assisted Small Incision Surgery|PROCEDURE: Thoracoscopy Combined With Laparoscopic Surgery
Perioperative incidence of cardiopulmonary complications, Perioperative complications include: pulmonary infection, respiratory failure, managed pleural effusion, heart failure, myocardial infarction, managed arrhythmia, anastomotic fistula or gastric fistula, recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, chylothorax, unscheduled reoperation, Through operation completion, an average of 12 days|disease-free survival（DFS）, The period after Operation treatment \[tumor eliminated\] when no disease can be detected, After surgery-related treatment until the tumor recurrence，assessed up to 5 years|overall survival（OS）, When the precise cause of Esophageal cancer death is not specified, this is called the overall survival rate or observed survival rate. Doctors use mean overall survival rates to estimate the patient's prognosis. This is often expressed over standard time periods, like one, five, and ten years., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 5 years
intraoperative blood loss, Calculation of intraoperative bleeding with ml/kg, During the operation, an average of 2 hours|Operation time, Calculate the operating time in minutes, During the operation, an average of 2 hours|Proportion of patients who converted to thoracotomy and laparotomy, The ratio of the number of patients converted to thoracotomy or laparotomy to the total number of patients undergoing surgery, During the operation, an average of 2 hours|Intraoperative mortality rate, The ratio of the number of patients who died during the operation to the number of patients who underwent the operation, During the operation, an average of 2 hours|Postoperative hospital stay, The days of postoperative hospitalization, Through postoperative hospital stay, an average of 4 days|Postoperative pain score, Daily pain scores were recorded by VAS (Visual Analogue Scale/Score) 1-3 days after operation, An average of 3 days after the operation|Postoperative admission time to ICU, If the patient needs to be transferred to ICU after operation, stay in icu monitoring time should be observed, An average of 3 days after the operation|Postoperative drainage, Total postoperative thoracic or mediastinal drainage (ml/kg), An average of 3 days after the operation|Postoperative retention time of various types of drainage tubes, The retention time of different types of drainage tube, An average of 3 days after the operation|Number of lymph nodes removed during surgery, The number of dissected lymph nodes reported in the postoperative pathology report, Pathology report time, an average of 4 days
To reduce postoperative pulmonary complications, considerable efforts have been made to develop the nontransthoracic esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. For instance, esophageal stripping and transhiatal esophagectomy are the nontransthoracic operations developed for treatment for esophageal cancer. These methods possess several advantages, including non-thoracotomy, less postoperative pain, less postoperative cardiac and pulmonary complications, and safer for elderly patients. However, these two methods are limited with the poor surgical view, poor mediastinal lymph node dissection (especially upper mediastinal lymph nodes), and high risk of bleeding.

In 2015 and 2016, Prof. Fujiwara has developed novel surgical methods on the dissection of upper mediastinal lymph nodes using single-port mediastinoscopy through the cervical incision and the lower mediastinal lymph nodes (including the subcarinal lymph nodes) by laparoscopy, respectively.For the first time, non-transthoracic radical resection of esophageal cancer could be achieved along with the dissection of all the mediastinal lymph nodes. Based on the Fujiwara's method, we further improved this surgical method to the"single-port inflatable mediastinoscopy combined with laparoscopy for the radical treatment of esophageal cancer"and has successfully performed this novel surgical method for the first case in March 2016. We have completed over 200 cases of radical resection of esophageal carcinoma using this novel surgical technique from May 2016 to August 2021.

This is a prospective, multicenter, open clinical study in which 1164 patients (including 10% drop-off rate) who require surgical treatment are scheduled to be included in the study. Prior to any screening process, each subject / legal guardian should sign the informed consent form. Screening tests are used to determine whether each subject is eligible for the study. Eligible subjects who meet the standard will be treated with radical resection of single-hole inflatable mediastinal mirror synchronization with laparoscopic esophageal carcinoma and followed up until 5 years postoperatively. Primary study outcome are the prioperative complication rate and the number of intraoperative lymph node dissection.
