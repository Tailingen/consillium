Neoadjuvant Endocrine Therapy in ER-positive, HER2-negative Early Stage Breast Cancer
The goal of this study is to access whether treatment of early state estrogen-rich breast cancers with neoadjuvant endocrine therapy will result in higher rates of margin negativity on lumpectomy specimen.

Change in margin status, Evaluate the effect of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (6-months course) on margin status of breast conservation surgery for women with early stage, low-risk breast cancer, defined as ER-positive, HER2-negative, node-negative breast carcinoma (single lesion only). Negative margin status is defined as no tumor on ink., Baseline, 6-months after neoadjuvant treatment and surgery
Residual cancer burden, The following parameters are required from pathologic examination in order to calculate Residual Cancer Burden (RCB) after neoadjuvant treatment: Primary tumor bed area, overall cancer cellularity (as percentage of area), percentage of cancer that is in situ disease, number of positive lymph nodes and diameter of largest metastasis. These parameters are filled in in the calculator that is available online to calculate the Residual Cancer Burden index: http://www3.mdanderson.org/app/medcalc/index.cfm?pagename=jsconvert3, After neoadjuvant treatment and surgery (approximately 6 months from diagnosis)|Pattern of response, Pattern of response (pathologic complete response, concentric shrinking with similar cellularity, size unchanged with decreased cellularity, no treatment response), After neoadjuvant treatment and surgery (approximately 6 months from diagnosis)|Change in satisfaction with cosmetic outcome, The Breast-QÂ© is a patient reported outcome measure for breast surgery that measures patient reported satisfaction and quality of life (QOL) developed by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. It is comprised of 10 scales that address: 1) psychosocial well-being, 2) sexual well-being, 3) satisfaction with breasts, 4) physical well-being, 5) adverse effects of radiation, 6) satisfaction with information - breast surgeon, 7) satisfaction with information - radiation oncologist, 8) satisfaction with surgeon, 9) satisfaction with medical team, 10) satisfaction with office staff. Each module is scored from 0-100 where higher scores reflect a better outcome., After neoadjuvant treatment and surgery (approximately 6 months and 12 months post-surgery)
Change in largest caliper measurement, Largest caliper measurement (millimeters) on post-therapy imaging vs. largest final size of tumor, Baseline, 6-months after neoadjuvant treatment and surgery
The goal of this study is to access whether treatment of early state estrogen-rich breast cancers with neoadjuvant endocrine therapy will result in higher rates of margin negativity on lumpectomy specimen.
