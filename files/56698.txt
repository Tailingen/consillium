Efficacy and Safety of ATO Plus ATRA in Nucleophosmin-1 Mutated Acute Myeloid Leukemia
In this open-label, randomized, prospective clinical trial, nucleophosmin-1(NPM1) mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients who have reached CR are randomized into two groups.The control group receive high-dose cytarabine(HDAC) regimen while the experimental group receive high dose of cytarabine plus tretinoin(ATRA) and arsenic trioxide(ATO) treatment.The safety and efficacy of ATRA and ATO is evaluated.
AML
DRUG: Cytarabine|DRUG: all-trans retinoic acid|DRUG: Arsenic Trioxide
Relapse-Free Survival Rate (RFS), RFS is defined as the time from the date of complete remission (CR) after entry in this trial until the date of documented relapse or death for NPM1 mutated leukemia patients who achieve CR., Within 5 years after randomization
Non-relapse Mortality, through treatment completion, an average of 5 months|Overall Survival Rate (OS), Within 5 years after randomization|Cumulative incidence of relapse, Within 5 years after randomization
In this open-label, randomized, prospective clinical trial, NPM1- mutated AML patients who have reached CR are randomized into two groups.

In experimental group, patients receive cytarabine at a dose of 3g/㎡/d on the first, third and fifth day, ATRA at a dose of 30mg/㎡/d on day 1-14 and ATO at a dose of 0.15mg/kg/d (maximum, 10mg/d) on day 1-14. Patients in control group only receive high dose of cytarabine.

The safety and efficacy of ATRA plus ATO regimen is evaluated.The primary outcome is relapse-free survival rate after treatment.
