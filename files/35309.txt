During the extension phase, participants were treated based on 28-day cycles and monitored for hematologic, nonhematologic, and renal toxicities. Recommended monitoring procedures included complete blood count with differential and platelets at least once each cycle prior to dosing and as needed, bone marrow biopsy and aspirate as clinically indicated, and additional tests or more frequent monitoring at the investigator's discretion based on the patient's clinical status. The azacitidine dose could be modified for toxicities. Laboratory data were not collected during the extension phase.
