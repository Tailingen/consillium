Observational Study of Nelarabine in Children and Young Adults
This international, multicentre, single arm, phase IV study will assess the safety and efficacy of nelarabine in children and young adults with relapsed or refractory T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) or lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) whose disease has not responded to or has relapsed following treatment with at least two chemotherapy regimens. It is a post-authorisation safety study (PASS) conducted for the purpose of confirming the safety profile and the clinical benefit of nelarabine under licensed conditions of use. The study is observational, non-interventional, and will include approximately 40 children and young adults (up to 21 years of age).
