Sequential Chemo-immunotherapy Plus Thoracic Radiotherapy for Elderly And/or Frail Stage III Non-small-cell Lung Cancer
Concurrent chemoradiotherapy without disease progression followed by consolidation durvalumab is standard of care for unresectable, stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (the 'PACIFIC regimen'). However, many patients with poor performance status, older age or comorbidities may be ineligible for chemotherapy due to expected high toxicity. The present study aim to investigate the efficacy and toxicities of sequential chemo-immunotherapy plus thoracic radiotherapy for elderly and/or frail stage III NSCLC patients unfit for concurrent chemoradiotherapy, and to identify the optimal thoracic dose for this patient population.
