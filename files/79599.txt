IDP-023 as a Single Agent and in Combination With Antibody Therapies in Patients With Advanced Hematologic Cancers
This is an open label, Phase 1/2, first-in-human, multiple ascending dose, and dose-expansion study of IDP-023 administered as a single agent and in combination with or without interleukin-2 (IL-2), and with or without isatuximab, daratumumab or rituximab to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary antitumor activity in patients with advanced hematologic cancers.

IDP-023 is an off-the-shelf, allogeneic cell product made of "natural killer" cells, also called NK cells. White blood cells are part of the immune system and NK cells are a type of white blood cell that are known to kill cancer cells.

This is an open label, Phase 1/2, first-in-human, multiple ascending dose, and dose-expansion study of IDP-023 administered as a single agent and in combination with or without interleukin-2 (IL-2), and with or without isatuximab, daratumumab or rituximab to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary antitumor activity in patients with relapsed and/or refractory advanced multiple myeloma (MM) or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), respectively.

The study is divided into a phase 1 dose escalation phase and a phase 2 expansion phase.

Phase 1 (Escalation Phase): The primary objectives of Phase 1 are to define the safety of different IDP-023 containing regimens and to define the recommended regimen and Phase 2 doses (RP2D) of IDP-023.

Phase 2 (Expansion Phase): The objective of the Phase 2 expansion cohort is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IDP-023 in advanced MM in combination with isatuximab or daratumumab and advanced NHL in combination with rituximab.
