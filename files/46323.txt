Clinical Efficacy and Safety of NK and NKT Cells Infusion in Patients With Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of natural killer (NK) cell and natural killer T (NKT) cell-based immunotherapy in subjects with non small cell lung cancer.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: natural killer and natural killer T cell
The incidence of adverse events following infusion of NK and NKT cells, 30 days post-infusion|Overall Survival (OS), Approximately 3 years
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Approximately 1 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR), confirmed by CT or MRI, or confirmed by biopsy, up to 24 weeks|Tumor Marker, up to 24 weeks
With the development of oncology and immunology in recent years, immunotherapy represents a novel path to obtain a durable and long-lasting response in cancer patients. NK and NKT cells are expanded conventionally from peripheral blood mononuclear cells by addition of a variety of cytokines in vitro culture. Our previous studies demonstrated that the expansion of NK and NKT cells in a clinical usage scale from peripheral blood mononuclear cells is feasible. Those expanded NK and NKT cells exhibit antitumor effect in vitro and in vivo against a variety of tumor cells. The current study proposes a 3-course treatment of doses administered at one week intervals with monitoring at each administration plus 4 weeks after the last dose. The total study time (apheresis through last follow-up) is estimated at 3 year.
