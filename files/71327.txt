Adebrelimab Maintenance Therapy After Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy with Hyperfractionated Radiotherapy in Limited-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) remains a challenging disease with poor prognosis and limited treatment options despite decades of research. SCLC is an immunogenic tumor, and the use of T-cell immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis has shown promising antitumor activity, potentially extending patient survival. The combination of concurrent chemoradiotherapy followed by immune maintenance therapy has demonstrated significant efficacy in limited-stage SCLC. Moreover, hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy (HART) has been shown to improve overall survival in limited-stage SCLC compared to standard dose radiotherapy without increasing toxicity. However, there is a lack of exploration into the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors following concurrent chemoradiotherapy with HART in limited-stage SCLC.

This exploratory clinical study aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of adebrelimab maintenance treatment following concurrent chemoradiotherapy with HART in patients with limited-stage SCLC through a single-arm, open-label, prospective, single-center clinical trial.
