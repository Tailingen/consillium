Early FDG PET/CT Imaging as a Measure of Response in Patients With Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma on Lenalidomide
Adult patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma who will be treated with lenalidomide will undergo FDG PET/CT scan as an early evaluation of response to therapy. Changes in FDG uptake will be correlated response and long term outcomes.
