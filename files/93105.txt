Head-to-Head Comparison of Hepatocellular Cancer (HCC) Screening Strategies: A Prospective Population-Based Cohort Study in Zhongshan City
Based on the preliminary retrospective validation of the efficacy of five HCC screening strategies(including conventional AFP combined with ultrasound-based general screening strategy, REACH-B, AGED, aMAPand aMAP 3.0 risk score) in Xiaolan Town, a head-to-head comparison for HCC screening is conducted in Zhongshan City, Guangdong Province. The study is a prospective, single-center, head-to-head trial aiming to enroll 4,500 HBsAg-positive individuals. It adopts a two-phase design of "HBV screening first, followed by HCC surveillance":Phase I: Recruitment of age-eligible populations at study sites for HBsAg screening to establish a high-risk cohort positive for hepatitis B surface antigen.Phase II: Implementation of uniform HCC surveillance (AFP combined with liver ultrasound every six months) for HBsAg-positive individuals, with concurrent application of different risk stratification models to evaluate risk levels and screening efficacy for each participant during follow-up.Furthurmore, based on baseline biological information and follow-up data, the study also aims to explore the development of a more effective risk prediction model for HCC.
Hepatocellular Cancer (HCC)
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Quantitative HBeAg Testing|BIOLOGICAL: Measurement Indicators Required for Risk Scoring in HCC Screening Strategies|BIOLOGICAL: Follow-Up Monitoring Parameters
Incidence of HCC, The number of newly diagnosed HCC cases divided by total person-years at risk during follow-up for each screening strategy., 3 years|Predictive performance (Sensitivity, Specificity, Positive Predictive value, AUC, etc.), Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value(PPV) and area under the ROC curve (AUC) will be calculated to evaluate the discrimination of each model., 3 years|Risk stratification accuracy, Participants will be categorized into different risk strata (high, intermediate, low) by each model, and their observed HCC incidence will be compared to assess stratification accuracy., 3 years
Screening positivity and referral rate, Proportion of participants identified as medium/high-risk and referred for further diagnostic imaging (e.g.,pathology/CT/MRI)., 3 years|Stage distribution of HCC cases identified by different screening strategies, 3 years|Early detection rate of HCC cases identified by different screening strategies, 3 years|Number Needed to Screen (NNS), Number of individuals needed to be screened to prevent one case of HCC., 3 years|Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER), The additional cost required to gain one extra QALY or to prevent one HCC case using a given model, compared with baseline strategy., 3 years|Time-dependent AUC or C-index, Model discrimination assessed at different time points using time-dependent ROC curves and concordance index (C-index)., 3 years|Model performance in subgroups, Subgroup analyses to compare predictive performance of each model in different populations (e.g., by sex, age, ALT level, HBV DNA level)., 3 years|Overall survival (OS), Indicates whether the participant was alive at the end of follow-up and their survival duration., 3 years|Screening adherence, The proportion of participants who completed biannual AFP and ultrasound screenings as scheduled during follow-up., 3 years
