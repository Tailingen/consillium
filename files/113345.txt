Cord Blood Transplantation for Patients With Cancer
The primary objective of this study is to assess the rate of engraftment with combined haploidentical-cord blood transplantation in patients with pre-existing donor specific antibodies and in those with active disease.
Hematological Disease
DRUG: Melphalan|DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: Antithymocyte Globulin (ATG)|DRUG: Busulfan|DRUG: Total Body Irradiation (TBI)
Cord Blood Engraftment by Day 100, Percent of subjects with cord blood engraftment on or before day 100. Detectable cord blood engraftment should be present by day 100 in at least 50% of patients.

As of 44 days post-transplant, only haploidentical donor chimerism achieved in the one patient enrolled in the Fludarabine, melphalan, and ATG arm. There were no cord cells detected for this patient., 100 days
Survival at Day 100, Percent of subjects who are alive 100 days after the stem cell infusion, 100 days
Primary Objective

- To assess the rate of engraftment with combined haploidentical-cord blood transplantation in patients with pre-existing donor specific anti-HLA antibodies and in those with active disease

Secondary Objectives

* To determine the long term fate of the haplo transplant and the cord blood transplant in this setting.
* To describe the incidence and severity of acute and chronic GVHD.
