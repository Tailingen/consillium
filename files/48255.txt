A Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of Glofitamab or Mosunetuzumab in Combination With Gemcitabine Plus Oxaliplatin in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma and High-Grade Large B-Cell Lymphoma
This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of glofitamab or mosunetuzumab in combination with gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (Glofit-GemOx or Mosun-GemOx) in participants with relapsed or refractory (R/R) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBCL).

DRUG: Glofitamab|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Mosunetuzumab|DRUG: Obinutuzumab|DRUG: Tocilizumab
Number of Deaths Due to Adverse Events (AEs), An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Pre-existing conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events., Baseline - 90 days after last dose of study treatment|Number of Treatment Discontinuations Due to AE, An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Pre-existing conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events., Baseline - 90 days after last dose of study treatment|Proportion of Participants With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Pre-existing conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events., Baseline - 90 days after last dose of study treatment|Proportion of Participants With Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) by Grade of Severity, Severity of CRS was determined according to the American Society for Transplantation and Cell Therapy (ASTCT) Consensus Grading Criteria, in which Grade 1 as fever (≥38.0°C) with or without other symptoms; Grade 2 as fever with hypotension not requiring vasopressors and/or hypoxia requiring the use of oxygen (low-flow); and Grade 3 as fever with hypotension requiring one vasopressor with or without vasopressin and/or hypoxia requiring the use of oxygen (high-flow)., Baseline - 90 days after last dose of study treatment
Tolerability of Study Treatment as Measured by Dose Interruptions, Dose Reductions, and Treatment Discontinuation Due to AEs, Up to approximately 16 months|Complete Response (CR) Based on PET/CT as Determined by the Investigator According to the 2014 Lugano Response Criteria, Per the 2014 Lugano Response Criteria for malignant lymphoma a CR = complete metabolic response with a score of 1, 2, or 3 on a 5-point scale (5PS), with higher scores indicating more extensive disease., Up to approximately 16 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Defined as the Proportion of Participants With a Best Overall Response of Partial Response (PR) or CR, as Determined by the Investigator According to the 2014 Lugano Response Criteria, Per the 2014 Lugano Response Criteria for malignant lymphoma a CR = complete metabolic response with a score of 1, 2, or 3 on a 5-point scale (5PS), while a PR = partial metabolic response with a score of 4 or 5 on 5PS with higher scores indicating more extensive disease., Up to approximately 16 months|Maximum Serum Concentration (Cmax) of Glofitamab, Cycle 1 Day 8 and Cycle 2 Day 1
