Efficacy of Intense Pulsed Light in the Treatment of Recurrent Chalazia
The purpose of the present study was to investigate the efficacy of intense pulse light and meibomian glands expression in cases of recurrent chalazion after surgery.
Chalazion
DEVICE: IPL-MGX
Recurrence rate of chalazia, The recurrence rate of the recurrent chalazia, an average of 1 year
NITBUT, non-invasive tear film breakup time, an average of 1 year|meibomian expressibility and quality, The expressibility and quality score of the meibum, an average of 1 year|TMH, tear meniscus height, an average of 1 year
We hypothesized that IPL application on the skin adjacent to eyelids after chalazion surgery will result in better meibomian gland function and lower recurrence. To date, it has not been previously reported the outcomes of the use of this technology for the management of chalazions recurrence. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the efficacy of intense pulse light and meibomian glands expression in cases of recurrent chalazion after surgery.
