Study of Intravenous TCD-717 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a Phase I dose escalation study of TCD-717, a novel drug that is a specific inhibitor of the enzyme choline kinase alpha, in patients with advanced solid tumors. The objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety of the drug and to determine the maximum tolerated dose and appropriate dose for phase II studies. Secondary objectives are to measure the efficacy of TCD-717; and in a substudy to be conducted in the MTD confirmation cohort only, to evaluate the potential correlation between the levels of tumor choline and tumor response to the choline kinase alpha inhibitor, TCD-717, using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Pharmacokinetics analysis will be performed on patients enrolled in the maximum tolerated dose confirmation cohort.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: TCD-717
Safety of TCD-717 given by 4-hour intravenous infusion, Patients will be monitored throughout the study for adverse events and dose limting toxicities., Duration of the study
Antitumor activity of TCD-717 given by 4-hour intravenous infusion, Efficacy of TCD-717 will be asessed by RECIST 1.1, Duration of study|MTD confirmation cohort only: Pharmacokinetics (PK) of TCD-717 given by 4-hour infusion, For patients enrolled in MTD confirmation cohort, PK (Cmax, Tmax, AUC) will be measured during Cycle 1, Day 1-28 of Cycle 1|To evaluate the potential correlation between the levels of tumor choline and tumor response to the choline kinase alpha inhibitor TCD-717 using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) (Substudy, MTD confirmation cohort only)., MTD confirmation cohort only, First scan will be pre-treatment (within 2 wks prior to start of treatment), then on Cycle 1 Day 25, and then within 7 days after determining disease progression
TCD Pharma has developed TCD-717, a novel drug that is a specific inhibitor of the enzyme choline kinase alpha (ChoKÎ±), involved in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine, which constitutes the major phospholipid in eukaryotic cell membranes and has been described as a potent oncogen when overexpressed in human cells. TCD-717 will be evaluated in this Phase I, open-label, single arm study to be performed at multiple centers. TCD-717 will be administered as a 4 hour infusion on two separate days per 7-day period per 28-day cycle (8 administrations per cycle). Eligible patients must have confirmed, metastatic or recurrent/refractory solid tumors.
