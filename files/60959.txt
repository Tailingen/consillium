Evaluate the Anatomical Distribution of BTG-002814 on Non-contrast Enhanced Imaging Using 4D CT, An automated thresholding and filtering algorithm was designed to allow the volume of delivered beads to be quantitatively determined for regions of interest (liver, registered sample, tumour, tumour dilated 1cm, tumour dilated 2cm) from the pre-surgical non-contrast CT scan and the PET/CT of the explanted liver samples following surgery., 1 day after treatment|Evaluation of Histopathological Features in the Surgical Specimen (Malignant and Non-malignant Liver Tissue) by Analysing Percentage of Tumour Necrosis and Viability, An evaluation of histopathological features in both malignant and non-malignant liver tissue from the surgical specimen was performed by microscopic examination. Sections of resected liver tissue was paraffin-embedded and Hematoxylin and Eosin (H\&E) slides were produced. The H\&E slides were scanned to produce 3D pathology models of tumour volume and compared to the 3D models generated from clinical imaging. This allowed the extent of tumour necrosis and viable tumour to be determined., Post-surgery (tumour resection)|Evaluation of Histopathological Features in the Surgical Specimen (Malignant and Non-malignant Liver Tissue) by Assessing Number of Participants With Any Vascular Changes., An evaluation of histopathological features in both malignant and non-malignant liver tissue from the surgical specimen was performed by microscopic examination. Sections of resected liver tissue was paraffin-embedded and Hematoxylin and Eosin (H\&E) slides were produced. The H\&E slides were scanned to produce 3D pathology models of tumour volume and compared to the 3D models generated from clinical imaging. This allowed any vascular changes to be determined., Post-surgery (tumour resection)|Assessment of Changes in Blood Flow on Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced (DCE) MRI Following Treatment With BTG-002814. The Following Parameters Will be Derived From DCE-MRI Images: Ktrans, Kep and Ve., After acquisition of DCE-MRI liver sequences, tumour signal intensity curves were used to calculate tissue parameters describing tumour perfusion, blood flow and vascularity, before and following treatment with BTG 002814.

Bland Altman analysis showed the variability between baseline and pre-treatment readings to be too high, so an interpretation of the changes in blood flow prior to surgery is unreliable., Baseline, pre-treatment, up to 3 days prior to surgical resection of tumour
Study Blood Biomarkers With the Potential to Identify Patients Likely to Respond to Treatment With BTG-002814, The following serum biomarkers were measured at Baseline, pre-treatment, 1 day after treatment, Up to 3 days prior to surgical resection, end of study ; cytokines, chemokines and growth factors relevant to cancer and inflammation., Baseline, pre-treatment, 1 day after treatment, Up to 3 days prior to surgical resection, end of study (28-32 days post-surgery).|Study Tissue Biomarkers to Explore Key Immune, Inflammatory and Drug Related Mechanisms, The following tissue biomarkers were measured at Baseline, pre-treatment, Up to 3 days prior to surgical resection; Levels of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in patients with HCC. Levels of serum Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA), Cancer Antigen (CA)19-9 and CA-125 in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC)., Baseline, pre-treatment, Up to 3 days prior to surgical resection.
A pilot open-label single arm multicenter phase 0 window of opportunity study of BTG-002814 given up to 3 weeks prior to surgery in up to 12 patients with resectable Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or Colorectal cancer (CRC) with liver metastases.
