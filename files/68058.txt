Laparoscopic Gastrectomy for Advanced Gastric Cancer
Although laparoscopic gastrectomy (LG) is widely used for the treatment of early gastric cancer, there have been few reports of the efficacy of LAG in the management of advanced gastric cancer(AGC). The aim of this study is to evaluate the surgical outcomes and oncologic safety of laparoscopic gastrectomy for AGC.
