This is an open-label, multi-centre single arm trial to investigate long-term safety and tolerability of degarelix in Korean patients with prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Degarelix
Number of Participants With Markedly Abnormal Values in Safety Laboratory Variables, The figures present the number of participants who had markedly abnormal levels of safety laboratory variables. Only the laboratory variables that had at least one participant with abnormal value are presented, more variables were included in the study.

ULN=upper limit of normal, From baseline (day 0) to end of treatment (up to day 364)|Number of Participants With Markedly Abnormal Values in Vital Signs and Body Weight, This outcome measure included incidence of markedly abnormal changes in blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), pulse, and body weight. The figures present the number of participants with normal baseline and at least one post-baseline markedly abnormal value., From baseline (day 0) to end of treatment (up to day 364)|Number of Participants With Markedly Abnormal Values in ECG Variables, This outcome measure included incidence of markedly abnormal changes in ECG variables (PR, QRS, and QT interval, QTcF, and ventricular rate). The figures present the number of participants with normal baseline and at least one post-baseline markedly abnormal value., From baseline (day 0) to end of treatment (up to day 364)
Serum Levels of Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Over Time, PSA levels were measured over time. The figures present the median level at day 0 (n=155 participants), day 196 (n=148), day 280 (n=115), and day 364 (n=109)., Day 0, day 196, day 280, and day 364
