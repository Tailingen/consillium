First-line Everolimus +/- Paclitaxel for Cisplatin-ineligible Patients With Advanced Urothelial Carcinoma
The purpose of this trial is to explore the activity and safety of everolimus +/- paclitaxel as first-line therapy for cisplatin-ineligible patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma.
Transitional Cell Carcinoma|Bladder Carcinoma|Urothelial Carcinoma
DRUG: Everolimus|DRUG: Everolimus|DRUG: Paclitaxel
Response Rate of Single-Agent Everolimus and Everolimus + Paclitaxel, To evaluate clinical benefit rate (complete response, partial response, and stable disease) at 4 months from initiation of treatment., 4 months
Number of Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, To determine the safety of everolimus and everolimus plus paclitaxel in this patient population. A summary with the count of events per grade is provided., 5 months|Progression Free Survival, To determine median progression free survival per RECIST 1.1, per cohort., 4 months|Overall Survival, To determine median overall survival at 1-year from the initiation of treatment., 12 months
OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study

Patients will be enrolled into one of two parallel cohorts:

* Cohort 1: impaired renal function AND poor performance status (cycle length = 28 days). Everolimus 10 mg orally daily
* Cohort 2: impaired renal function OR poor performance status (cycle length = 28 days). Everolimus 10 mg orally daily + IV Paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 on D1, 8, 15

Restaging evaluations will be performed after every 2 cycles.

Treatment will continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Karnofsky performance status 60-70%
