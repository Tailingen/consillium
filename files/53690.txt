The Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial of Kushen Injection
The randomized controlled multicenter clinical study of compound Kushen Injection to reduce the radiotherapy related adverse reactions in lung cancer is a phase Ⅳ clinical trials，The main purpose is to evaluate the effect of compound Kushen Injection in preventing and reducing the radiotherapy related adverse reactions. The participants of the clinical trials are patients with lung cancer who need thoracic radiotherapy. In clinical trials, one group of participants is given compound Kushen Injection with chemoradiotherapy, while another group is only given chemoradiotherapy. The period of trials is 18 months.

Patients with lung cancer who need thoracic radiotherapy will be enrolled in the trial, then seprated randomly in two group,the KS injection group treated with chemoradiotherapy plus KS injection; the contral group treated with chemoradiotherapy only. After 6 months observation, The rates of incidence and the degree of adverse reactions caused by redioterapy; the completion rate of radiotherapy; clinical Symptoms; Qof and pulmonary function tests etc. will be evaluated.
