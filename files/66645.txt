Adjuvant IP-001 Treatment for HCC Patients Following Surgical Resection and Ablation or Ablation Alone
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single injection of IP-001 as adjuvant therapy after local ablation or surgical resection and ablation in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

DRUG: 1.0% IP-001 for injection|PROCEDURE: Surgical Resection and Local Ablation|PROCEDURE: Local Ablation Alone
Recurrence Free Survival, Radiological assessments (Triphasic CT or MRI) of the chest, abdomen and pelvis will occur every 12 weeks for the first 2 years, then every 24 weeks thereafter. Recurrence will be determined by the investigator's radiological review per RECIST v1.1, From Date of Randomization until date of documented progression, assessed up to 60 months

This is a Phase 2, two-armed, randomized study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single administration of intratumoral IP-001 injection following local ablation or surgical resection and local ablation in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who have an intermediate or high risk of recurrence compared to curative ablation or ablation and surgical resection.
