Phase I Study of HRS-4642 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors Harboring KRAS G12D Mutation
The study is being conducted to evaluate the safety and tolerability of HRS-4642 in patients with advanced solid tumors harboring KRAS G12D mutation.To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or a biologically active dose (eg, recommended phase 2 dose \[RP2D\]) within investigated subject population groups
