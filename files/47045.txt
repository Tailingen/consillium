CT7, MAGE-A3, and WT1 mRNA-electroporated Autologous Langerhans-type Dendritic Cells as Consolidation for Multiple Myeloma Patients Undergoing Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation
The purpose of this study is to see if the investigator can help the immune system to work against myeloma.

This study will see if a vaccine made with altered dendritic cells will make T cells work against tumor cells. The stem cells collected for the transplant will also be used to grow dendritic cells in the lab. The dendritic cells will carry the antigens. These cells then will be injected under the skin. The investigators will do lab studies before and after the vaccination to find out if the vaccine is working.
Multiple Myeloma
BIOLOGICAL: CT7, MAGE-A3, and WT1 mRNA-electroporated Langerhans cells ( LCs)|OTHER: Standard of care
Number of Participants Evaluated for Vaccine Safety, Participants will be evaluated for the safety of the vaccine, monitored and graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0 for toxicity and adverse event reporting to the Food and Drug Administration. Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as grade 3 or higher toxicity. The only toxicities captured outside of the SAEs reported will be all grade 1-5 toxicites deemed definitely, probably, or possibly related to the vaccine portion of the study., 1 year
Median Progression Free Survival, Median profression free survival., Up to 7 years
