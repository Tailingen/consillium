Study of Pazopanib, Irinotecan and Cetuximab in Combination to Treat 2nd Line Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
Subjects will be entered into cohorts of 3 for the dose escalation phase so that the maximum tolerated dose can be determined. 18 additional patients will be recruited once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined for disease assessment.
