Electroacupuncture in Symptom Management After Cytoreductive Surgery and Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy
The investigators are conducting this research study is to evaluate the feasibility (recruitment, compliance, safety, and acceptance) of using electroacupuncture (EA) to manage complex symptoms such as pain, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, and insomnia in patients who have undergone Cytoreductive Surgery and Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy. Additionally, the investigators are aiming to determine the effectiveness of EA in reducing these symptoms, and to examine how EA impacts important biomarkers, or proteins in the blood, that can be used as indicators or signs of these symptoms.

Cytoreductive Surgery and Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy Symptoms - EORTC QLQ-C30, The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-30) is a validated questionnaire developed to assess cancer patients' health-related quality of life. It incorporates 5 functional scales (cognitive, emotional, physical, role, and social), symptom scales (e.g. pain, fatigue, insomnia), and a global health scale. Most questions used 4-point scale (1 'Not at All' to 4 'Very Much'); 2 questions used 7-point scale (1 'Very Poor' to 7 'Excellent'). Scores are averaged, and transformed to 0-100 scale. Higher scores represent a better global health status and better degree of functioning while lower symptom scores indicate less severe symptoms.

In addition to this questionnaire, patients' clinical notes will be reviewed to better characterize the respective symptoms., All the mean scores will be compared at baseline (before surgery), 1 month post-surgery, and 6 months post-surgery.|Efficacy of EA in managing Cytoreductive Surgery and Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy Symptoms - EORTC QLQ-C30, The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-30) is a validated questionnaire developed to assess cancer patients' health-related quality of life.

Electroacupuncture interventions will be performed between postoperative months 1 to 3; a total of 8 weekly interventions will be performed. A completion assessment will be performed at approximately 6 months s/p Cytoreductive Surgery and Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy.

Our specific aims are as follows:

To examine the feasibility of utilizing an EA protocol in patients who have undergone Cytoreductive Surgery and Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy.

To characterize symptoms experienced by patients during recovery from Cytoreductive Surgery and Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy.

To evaluate the utilization of EA in symptom management during recovery from Cytoreductive Surgery and Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy.

To evaluate levels of biomarkers such as circulating brain-derived neurotrophic factor, pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, Tumor necrosis factor-alpha), mitochondrial DNA after Cytoreductive Surgery and Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy and with utilization of EA.
