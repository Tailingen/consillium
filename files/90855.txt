Beyond the Lung Cancer Diagnosis: Leveraging the Oncology Clinic Setting for Actively Smoking Family Members
The purpose of this pilot study is to examine, in an innovative setting, the potential for a lung cancer diagnosis in a loved one to represent a teachable moment for smoking cessation in family members or caregivers who are current smokers. The researchers will identify the willingness and preferred modality for smoking cessation among family members/caregivers in this setting. The researchers will estimate abstinence rates at 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks..
