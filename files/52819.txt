PD-1 Antibody + XELOX in 1st Line Serum A-fetoprotein (AFP)-Elevated Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of of anti-PD-1 antibody in combination with chemotherapy as first-line treatment in patients with unresectable, locally advanced recurrent or metastatic serum AFP-elevated gastric and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.

AFP-elevated gastric adenocarcinoma is a special type of gastric cancer, with the characteristics of high risk of liver and lymph node metastasis, poor therapeutic effect, and dismal prognosis.

This prospective study is a single-arm, multicenter phase II clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of anti-PD-1 antibody in combination with chemotherapy as first-line treatment in patients with unresectable, locally advanced recurrent or metastatic serum AFP-elevated gastric and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.

AFP elevation is defined as serum AFP \> 20 ng/ml. In this prospective study, the objective remission rate (ORR) will be used as primary outcome measures and 30 patients will be recruited. Anti-PD-1 antibody in combination with chemotherapy will be administered. PD-L1 expression and tumor mutant burden (TMB) will be measured before treatment. In addition, the dynamic changes of serum AFP levels, T lymphocyte in peripheral blood will be monitored during treatment. In the course of treatment, safety evaluation will be carried out according to the standard of adverse reaction classification (CTCAE) 4.0.
