The aim of this phase II trial is to assess progress-free survival, local control, overall survival, safety and tolerability of SBRT to treat patients with oligometastases in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

RADIATION: SBRT
Progression-free survival, progression-free survival will be measured as time to either progression or death, The survival time from the date each patient enrolled to the date of progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 5 years
Local control, Local control will be measured as time to local recurrence, the time from the date each patient enrolled to the date of local failure or the last follow-up, assessed up to 5 years.|overall survival, Overall survival will be measured as time until death from any cause, The survival time from the date each patient enrolled to the date of death or the last follow-up, assessed up to 5 years.
