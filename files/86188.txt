Validity of Sentinel Lymphnode Biopsy After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Cancer Patients With Radiologically Positive Axillary Lymph Nodes
Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is currently debatable. It is possible that the tumor response to chemotherapy may alter the lymphatic drainage thus causing lower SLN identification rate and higher false negative rate. Further, the response of NAC can be different in each lymph nodes. It is doubtful whether SLNB can accurately predict axillary lymph node (ALN) status after NAC. The aim of this study to determine the identification rate, the false-negative rate, and the accuracy of SLNB after NAC for node positive breast cancer.
