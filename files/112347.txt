Advanced Solid Tumors|Melanoma
BIOLOGICAL: AK104
Anti-tumor activity of AK104 using objective response rate (ORR) based on RECIST v1.1 as assessed by the investigator, The ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects with confirmed CR or confirmed PR, based on RECIST Version 1.1., Up to 2 years
Number of subjects experiencing adverse events (AEs), An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment., From the time of informed consent through 90 days after last dose of AK104|Disease control rate (DCR), The DCR is defined as the proportion of subjects with CR, PR, or SD (subjects achieving SD will be included in the DCR if they maintain SD for â‰¥8 weeks) based on RECIST Version 1.1., Up to 2 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival is defined as the time from the start of treatment with AK104 until the first documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 2 years|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the time from the start of treatment with AK104 until death due to any cause., Up to 2 years|Duration of response (DoR), Duration of response is defined as the duration from the first documentation of objective response to the first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 2 years|Minimum observed concentration (Cmin) of AK104 at steady state, The endpoints for assessment of PK of AK104 include serum concentrations of AK104 at different timepoints after AK104 administration., From first dose of AK104 through to 90 days after last dose of AK104|Number of subjects who develop detectable anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), The immunogenicity of AK104 will be assessed by summarizing the number of subjects who develop detectable anti-drug antibodies (ADAs)., From first dose of AK104 through to 90 days after last dose of AK104
