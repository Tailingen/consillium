A Study of Oprozomib, Melphalan, and Prednisone in Transplant Ineligible Patients With Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of Phase 1b of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of oprozomib in combination with melphalan and prednisone (OMP).

The purpose of Phase 2 of the study is to estimate the overall response rate (ORR) and complete response rate (CRR) of the OMP combination.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Oprozomib|DRUG: Melphalan|DRUG: Prednisone
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) - Phase 1b, MTD is defined as the highest dose at which a DLT is observed in less than 2 of 6 evaluable subjects occurring within the 4 weeks after the first dose of combination therapy., 42 weeks|Overall Response Rate (ORR) - Phase 2, ORR defined as a best overall response of sCR, CR, VGPR, or PR according to the IMWG-URC., 39 months|Complete Response Rate (CRR) - Phase 2, CRR defined as a best overall response of sCR or CR according to the IMWG-URC., 39 months
Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) - Phase 2, Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) graded according to the NCI-CTCAE (Version 4.03)., Collected from signing of informed consent and throughout study until 30 days after the last dose of study treatment (up to 58 weeks)|Population Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters - apparent clearance and volume of distribution, Evaluate population pharmacokinetic (PK) parameter estimates of oprozomib and variability in these estimates when administered in combination with melphalan and prednisone using a sparse sampling strategy and population-based analysis methodology., 2 postdose time points in Cycle 1 Day 1, 1 predose and 2 postdose time points on Cycle 3 Day 1 and Cycle 5 Day 1|Duration of Response (DOR), Duration of Response (DOR) is defined as the time from evidence of PR or better to disease progression or death due to any cause., 39 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival is defined as the time from the first day of study treatment (Cycle 1 Day 1) to the earlier of disease progression or death due to any cause., 39 months
