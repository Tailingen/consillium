Safety and Efficacy Study of BMS-908662 in Combination With Ipilimumab in Subjects With Advanced Melanoma
The purpose of the study is to identify a safe and tolerable dose of BMS-908662 in combination with ipilimumab; and then to evaluate the anti-tumor response to BMS-908662 when administered in combination with ipilimumab.
Melanoma
DRUG: BMS-908662|DRUG: BMS-908662|DRUG: Ipilimumab|DRUG: Ipilimumab
Toxicity will be evaluated according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3, Assessments approximately every 3 weeks throughout the duration of the trial
Efficacy as determined by estimates of objective response rates and response duration, Efficacy measured every 6 weeks until week 48, then every 12 weeks|PK for BMS-908662 as determined by minimum and maximum observed concentrations, time of maximum observed concentration, area under the concentration curve for one dosing interval and the accumulation index, PK measured during first 4 weeks on study|PD will be assessed by evaluating markers of RAS/RAF pathway activity, PD assessed during the first 4 weeks on study
The purpose of the study is to identify a safe and tolerable dose of BMS-908662 in combination with ipilimumab; and then to evaluate the anti-tumor response to BMS-908662 when administered in combination with ipilimumab.
