Exploratory Study of Norepinephrine to Prevent Alopecia in Head and Neck Cancer Patients Treated With Radiotherapy
The study will evaluate the safety of topical norepinephrine in head and neck cancer patients who are receiving treatment with intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT).

The study will also provide information about whether topical norepinephrine can prevent or decrease the severity of the radiation-induced alopecia experienced by these patients.
Alopecia|Radiodermatitis
DRUG: Norepinephrine
Safety of daily topical application of norepinephrine to the radiation field., The primary safety hypothesis is that there will be that there will be little or no scalp irritation associated with the application of the topical norepinephrine and that there will be no systemic effects secondary to transdermal absorption., Safety will be assessed during the study (6-7 weeks) and at follow-up visits approximately 2 and 4 weeks after the end of the treatment period.
Efficacy of daily topical application of norepinephrine to the radiation field., The primary efficacy hypothesis is that areas of the scalp that are treated with topical norepinephrine immediately prior to intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) will have less severe alopecia than scalp sites that are not treated with topical norepinephrine and that receive only placebo., Efficacy will be assessed during the study (6-7 weeks) and at follow-up visits approximately 2 and 4 weeks after the end of the treatment period
