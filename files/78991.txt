To ascertain the possibilities to isolate the breast cancer olfactive signature, Isolation of volatile Organic Compounds to breast cancer by a sensitive technique with an odor-sensing polymer (Sorbstar®) on hands. Friction of the hands according to the protocol before and after surgical excision of the tumor. Sorbstar® analyses will be performed with a thermodesorption method coupled with full two-dimensional gas chromatography and mass spectrometry., 18 months
Ascertain breast cancer olfactive signature from the tumor (Isolation of volatile Organic Compounds to tumor breast samples by a sensitive technique with an odor-sensing polymer (Sorbstar®), During the surgical procedure an odor-sensing polymer (Sorbstar®) over the tumor is placed. Sorbstar® analyzes will be performed with a thermodesorption method coupled with full two-dimensional gas chromatography and mass spectrometry., 18 months|Ascertain breast cancer detection by the dogs of Curie Institut, Patients sleep over a night with a compress positioned on the affected breast before and after surgery. The compress will be analyzed by the dogs of Curie Institut (results cancer/not cancer)., 18 months
Patient recruitment during the first surgery consultation in Curie Institute.

Odor sampling (non-invasive) with an odor-sensing polymer (Sorbstar® polymer developed especially for the trace level analysis), on:

* The hands, before and after surgical excision of the tumor (friction of the hands)
* The diseased breast, before and after surgical excision of the tumor (via a compress positioned on the breast for 1 night)
* The tumor, during the surgical procedure (odor collection over a tumor sample).

Each patient will be her own witness, before and after surgical excision, in an attempt to isolate the chemical signature tracks of breast cancer. The samples after surgery will be made after healing and before implementation of a treatment (chemotherapy and / or radiotherapy).
