Effect of Rocuronium on BIS Values
Aim of this trial is to define if Trend of Four (TOF) values after a bolus of rocuronium is correlated with Bispectral Index BIS values during standard general anaesthesia for breast surgery.
Breast Cancer|General Anaesthesia
DRUG: Rocuronium
Correlation between Trend of Four (TOF) and Bispectral Index (BIS) values, Discover if there is linear correlation between TOF values (utilized for curarization monitoring) and BIS values (utilized for deep of hypnosis monitoring) during standard general anaesthesia conducted with Propofol and remifentanil with targeted controlled infusion pumps, usually adopted in our Hospital to delivery general anaesthesia, 60 minutes after rocuronium bolus
Rocuronium. a curarizing agent, has been shown to decrease Bispectral Index (BIS) in awake volunteers.

However, correlation between Trend of Four (TOF) values after a bolus of rocuronium and BIS values during general anaesthesia for breast surgery has not been defined yet.

Investigators want to analyze this correlation during general anaesthesia conducted using Propofol and remifentanil. All of these drugs will be delivered with Targeted-Controlled Infusion pumps (in particular Eleveld for Propofol, Minto for Remifentanil), commonly used to deliver general anaesthesia. At stable anaesthesia maintenance, if requested for surgical (ie more muscle relaxation) or anesthesiological reasons (i.e. avoid air insufflation) a standard Rocuronium bolus (0.6 mg/kg) was given. In these case, with rocuronium bolus justified by clinical reasons, authors will observationally record the BIS values and the TOF values.
