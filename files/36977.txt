Temozolomide as a Prophylaxis Against Brain Recurrence in Participants With Metastatic Breast Cancer (P05225 AM2)
The purpose of this study is to determine whether temozolomide can be used as a prophylaxis against brain recurrence in participants with metastatic breast cancer.
Breast Neoplasm|Brain Neoplasm|Second Neoplasm
DRUG: temozolomide
Percent of Participants With Recurrence of Brain Metastases, The analysis could not be performed due to low enrollment., 1 Year
Number of Days With Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time interval from randomization to objective tumor progression or death from any cause.

The analysis could not be performed due to low enrollment., 24, 38, and 52 weeks|Number of Days With Disease-free Survival (DFS), DFS was defined as the time interval from randomization to any relapse (loco-regional, contra-lateral, and/or distant).

The analysis could not be performed due to low enrollment., 24, 38, and 52 weeks|Number of Days With Distant Disease-free Survival (DDFS), DDFS was defined as the time interval from randomization to only distant metastases (for example, bone, visceral organ, brain).

The analysis could not be performed due to low enrollment., 24, 38, and 52 weeks|Number of Days With Brain Recurrence-free Survival (BRFS), BRFS was defined as the time interval from randomization to the appearance of brain metastases.

The analysis could not be performed due to low enrollment., 24,38, and 52 weeks|Number of Days on Temozolomide Treatment, This outcome measure was only applicable to the temozolomide arm; the observation arm was therefore not analyzed., Baseline to 24 Weeks|Total Dose of Temozolomide Taken, This outcome measure was only applicable to the temozolomide arm; the observation arm was therefore not analyzed., Baseline to 24 Weeks|Number of Participants Who Had at Least One Dose Reduction During Treatment, This outcome measure was only applicable to the temozolomide arm; the observation arm was therefore not analyzed., Baseline to 24 Weeks|Number of Participants Who Had at Least One Treatment Omission During Treatment, This outcome measure was only applicable to the temozolomide arm; the observation arm was therefore not analyzed., Baseline to 24 Weeks|Number of Participants Who Completed the Third Cycle of Treatment, This outcome measure was only applicable to the temozolomide arm; the observation arm was therefore not analyzed., Baseline to 24 Weeks
Breast cancer is the second most common cause of brain metastases. Overall survival after the development of brain metastases tends to be poor (6-8 months). Over-expression of Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER-2/neu), negative estrogen receptor, and young age at diagnosis seem to be indicators of high risk for brain metastases. Temozolomide may be a good candidate for prophylactic chemotherapy because of its ability to cross the blood-brain-barrier, achieving high concentrations in the central nervous system (CNS).
