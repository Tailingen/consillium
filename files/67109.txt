This is a phase 1b/II, open-label, multicenter study of LVGN6051 combined with anlotinib in patients with locally advanced, metastatic or recurrent refractory soft tissue sarcoma.

The study is comprised of a dose escalation phase (Ib) to determine the RP2D and an expansion phase (II) to further explore the safety and efficacy of combination treatment.
