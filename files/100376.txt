A Phase 1 Study of IS-002 Injection in Patients Undergoing Robotic Prostatectomy
This is a Phase 1, single-site, interventional clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of IS-002 intravenous (IV) injection for fluorescent identification and delineation of the positive cancer margins and metastatic lymph nodes during prostatectomy surgery using the da Vinci® X/Xi Surgical System with Firefly® Fluorescent Imaging.
