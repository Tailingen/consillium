A Study of LY3022855 in Combination With Durvalumab or Tremelimumab in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF-1R) inhibitor LY3022855 in combination with durvalumab or tremelimumab in participants with advanced solid tumors.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: LY3022855|DRUG: Durvalumab|DRUG: Tremelimumab
Recommended Phase 2 Dose of LY3022855 Combined With Durvalumab (Maximum Tolerated Dose [MTD]), Recommended Phase 2 dose of LY3022855 that could be safely administered in combination with Durvalumab was based on defined dose limiting toxicities (DLT) assessment and MTD definition. MTD is defined as the highest tested dose that has less than 33% probability of causing a DLT., Cycle 1 (4 weeks)
Percentage of Participants Who Exhibit Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) [Overall Response Rate (ORR)], ORR was estimated as the percentage of participants with best response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR), based on RECIST version 1.1 divided by the total number of participants. CR is defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no appearance of new lesions. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline sum LD), no progression of non-target lesions, and no appearance of new lesions. Progressive disease (PD) is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, with reference being the smallest sum on study and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm, or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, or 1 or more new lesions., Baseline through Measured Progressive Disease or Death (Up To 24 months)|Percentage of Participants Who Exhibit Stable Disease (SD) or CR or PR [Disease Control Rate (DCR)], DCR is the percentage of participants with a best overall response of CR, PR or SD as defined by RECIST v1.1. CR is defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no appearance of new lesions. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline sum LD), no progression of non-target lesions, and no appearance of new lesions. SD is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD) for target lesions, no progression of non-target lesions, and no appearance of new lesions. PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, with reference being the smallest sum on study and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm, or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, or 1 or more new lesions., Baseline through Measured Progressive Disease (Up To 24 months)|Number of Participants With Anti-LY3022855, Anti-Durvalumab or Anti-Tremelimumab Antibodies, Number of participants with positive Anti-LY3022855, Anti-Durvalumab or Anti-Tremelimumab Antibodies was summarized by cohorts., Baseline through Follow-up (Up To 24 Months)|Pharmacokinetics (PK): Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of LY3022855 in Combination With Either Durvalumab or Tremelimumab, and the Single-Dose, Pharmacokinetics (PK): Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of LY3022855 in Combination with either Durvalumab or Tremelimumab, and the Single-Dose, Cycle 1 Day 1: 2 hours post End of Infusion (EOI), Day 2: 24-hour post EOI, Day 3: 48 hour post EOI; Cycle 2 Day 8: 2 h post-EOI, Day 9: 24 h post-EOI, Day 10: 48 h post-EOI
The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF-1R) inhibitor LY3022855 in combination with durvalumab or tremelimumab in participants with advanced solid tumors.
