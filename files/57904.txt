3-months deterioration-free rate, EORTC QLQ-C30 (validated version for Turkish using a reduction of at least 10 points as a meaningful clinical difference) will be used to calculate "time until definitive deterioration" (TUDD) and compare patients receiving first-line Nab-Paclitaxel plus Gemcitabine versus first-line gemcitabine for metastatic or locally advanced unresectable adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. EORTC QLQ-C30 scores will be calculated every four weeks following the EORTC QLQ-C30 recommendations for calculations and scoring (EORTC QLQ- C30 published manual)., From first dose of therapy to third month of therapy, 3 months
Overall Survival, From first dose to death or end of the therapy, 24 months
