Clinical and Ultrasound Incidence of Rheumatologic Immune Related Adverse Events in Stage IIB-IV Melanoma Patients
Rheumatologic adverse events are expected to affect between 3% and 7.5% of patients undergoing immunotherapy and are likely to be underdiagnosed.

The main aim of this observational prospective study is to investigate the clinical and ultrasonographic incidence of rheumathologic immune related adverse events in a cohort of patients affected by stage IIB, IIC, III and IV melanoma undergoing treatment with immune-checkpoint inhibitors.

Patients will:

* receive immune-checkpoint inhibitor therapy, according to disease stage and current National Guidelines.
* undergo dermatologic visit prior to the start of immune-checkpoint inhibitor therapy and at scheduled follow-ups.
* undergo rheumatologic visit prior to the start of immune-checkpoint inhibitor therapy and at scheduled follow-ups.
* receive a quality of life questionnaire (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire - Core 30 version 3.0) prior to the start of immune-checkpoint inhibitor therapy and at scheduled follow-ups.
