DRUG: Ixabepilone, 32 mg/m^2 + Lapatinib, 1000 mg|DRUG: Ixabepilone, 32 mg/m^2 + Lapatinib, 1250 mg|DRUG: Ixabepilone, 40 mg/m^2 + Lapatinib, 1250 mg|DRUG: Ixabepilone + Lapatinib + Capecitabine
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) of Ixabepilone When Administered With Lapatinib, The MTD is defined as the maximum dose that can be administered to 6 participants such that no more than 1 (or fewer than one third if more than 6 participants receive treatment) experiences a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), with at least 2 experiencing a DLT at the next higher dose level. The RP2D is based on the MTD and the assessment of any relevant chronic toxicities., Days 1 through 21|MTD and RP2D of Ixabepilone When Administered With Lapatinib Plus Capecitabine, MTD is defined as the maximum dose that can be administered to 6 participants such that no more than 1 (or fewer than one third if more than 6 participants receive treatment) experiences a DLT, with at least 2 experiencing a DLT at the next higher dose level.
