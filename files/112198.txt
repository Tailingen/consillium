Comparison of Sevoflurane and Isoflurane Anesthesia for Benign Breast Tumor Excision
Generally, benign breast tumors are excised under the local anesthesia. But such action was so invasive that every patient would experience the physiological and psychological stimuli unavoidably. Sevoflurane was advised as a better inhalational anesthesic for its "easy come,easy go" property during short-lasting operations than isoflurane. We purposed that sevoflurane would be a superior anesthesic for benign breast tumor excision than isoflurane with relative less alteration in hemodynamics, less postoperative side effects and easily-control the depth of anesthesia.
