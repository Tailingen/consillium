Oregovomab in Combination With Bevacizumab Plus Chemo in BRCA Wild Type Platinum Sensitive Recurrent Ovarian Cancer
This is a single arm phase 1b/2 evaluation of the combination of oregovomab, and bevacizumab, paclitaxel carboplatin in adult subjects with CA125-associated, advanced recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or peritoneal carcinoma (FIGO Stage III/IV) with BRCA-wild type, previously treated with 1 prior lines of therapy, and with platinum free intervals of \>6 months since last platinum-based treatment.

BIOLOGICAL: Oregovomab|DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin
Safety and Tolerability, Assessment of Dose Limiting toxicity (DLT) based on incidences and severity of adverse events will be measured according to CTCAE v5.0, 1cycle (21days)|Efficacy based on overall response rate (ORR), Overall response rate measured as the Percentage of Participants with a Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR), as Determined by the Investigator According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECISTv1.1), Every 6 weeks (each cycle is 21 days)
Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS, defined as date of first study treatment to the date of event defined as the first documented progression as per RECIST v1.1 or death due to any cause, Date of randomization up until date of first documented disease progression or date of death from any cause, whichever comes first|Overall Survival (OS), OS, defined as date of first study treatment to date of death due to any cause, Date of randomization up until date of death from any cause
This study is an open-label, single arm, phase 1b/II, multicenter study.

In phase 1b part, the recommended phase 2 dose of oregovomab combined with bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin will be examined. Approximately 3 to 12 subjects("3+3" dose finding design) will be enrolled in phase 1b trial with starting dose of 2mg oregovmab.

In Phase II trial, response rate of combination with oregovomab and bevacizumab, paclitaxel will be examined. Based on Simon's two stage model, 8 patients will be enrolled in first stage, after review of efficacy (response rate) of study treatment, 30 additional subjects for second stage of phase 2 will be enrolled. Considering 10% of screening failure rate, overall 42 patients will be enrolled in phase 2 trial.
