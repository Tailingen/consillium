Prospective Assessment of Quality of Life in Patients Treated by Radiosurgery for Brain Metastases (PRAMECE-1302)
The aim of the study is to assess prospectively the impact of radiosurgery on the quality of life in patients with brain metastases.
Neoplasm Metastases
OTHER: questionnaire administration
Impact at 6 months of the radiosurgery based on the evaluation of 4 criteria of the QLQ C30 questionnaire, The 4 criteria are the perceived overall state, health, physical functioning, cognitive functioning and tiredness, 6 months
Comparison of the scores obtained on the scales, questionnaires and Performance status at baseline and every 3 months (until 12 months) after Gamma Knife treatment, QLQ C30, BN20 (quality of life), IADL (autonomy), HADS (anxiety-depression), MoCA (cognition), ESAS (quality of life), Performance status (OMS), 1 year|Comparison of the scores obtained on the scales and questionnaires according to the type of primary cancer at baseline and every 3 months (until 12 months) after Gamma Knife treatment, QLQ C30, BN20 (quality of life), IADL (autonomy), HADS (anxiety-depression), MoCA (cognition), 1 year|Comparison of the scores obtained on different scales according to the type of associated treatments at baseline and every 3 months (until 12 months) after Gamma Knife treatment, The type of associated treatments are: chemotherapy, targeted therapy, corticoids, anti-epileptics, psychotropic drugs.

The different scales are QLQ C30, BN20 (quality of life), IADL (autonomy), HADS (anxiety-depression), ESAS (quality of life) and MoCA (cognition), 1 year|Correlation between the scores obtained on the different scales at the baseline and the progression-free survival / overall survival, 1 year|Correlation between the scores obtained on the scales QLQ C30, BN20 (quality of life), IADL (autonomy), HADS (anxiety-depression), MoCA (cognition), ESAS (quality of life) at baseline and those obtained at 3, 6, 9, 12 months, 1 year|Correlation between the scores obtained on the scales during the study and the clinical neurological response at baseline and every 3 monts until 12 months after Gamma Knife treatment, The correlation will take into account the evolution of the systemic disease and the volumetric tumor response. Volumetric tumor responses will be calculated on the MRI's, 1 year
The patients who meet the selection criteria and who have accepted to participate at the study will answer different questionnaires of the study before radiosurgery and at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after the treatment of brain metastases. Baseline examinations will be done before receiving the treatment during the hospitalisation for the Gamma Knife treatment, and then they will be repeated at the evaluation visits which are classically done every 3 months. MRI's will also be performed every 3 months. In this way, no additional travel or MRI will be carried out as part of the study.
