Study of Bromodomain and Extra-Terminal Protein (BET) Inhibitor RO6870810 as Mono- and Combination Therapy in Advanced Multiple Myeloma
This is a Phase Ib, open-label, multicenter, global study designed to assess the safety and tolerability of RO6870810 as monotherapy and in combination with daratumumab in participants with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Each treatment cycle will be 21 days in length. There are two parts to this study. A dose-escalation phase (Part I) will be used to evaluate the safety and tolerability and dose limiting toxicities, and to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTR)/optimum biological dose (OBD) of RO6870810 when given as monotherapy or in combination with daratumumab. A dose-expansion phase (Part II) will further characterize the safety, tolerability and activity of RO6870810 as monotherapy or in combination with daratumumab at the defined expansion dose-levels.

Percentage of Participants with Adverse Events, An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events., From baseline to end of study (up to approximately 2.5 years)|Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of RO6870810, Maximum observed concentration of RO6870810 as determined by measuring drug concentration in blood samples over time., Cycle 1, Days 1 and 15: predose, 0.25 hours (h), 0.5 h, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 8 h, 10 h, 24 h, 48 h; Cycle 1, Day 8 predose; all subsequent cycles predose on Day 1 and at end of treatment (EOT- up to approximately 2.5 years)|Time to Reach Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (tmax) of RO6870810, Time from dose administration to observed maximum serum concentration for RO6870810 as determined by measuring drug concentration in blood samples over time., Cycle 1, Days 1 and 15: predose, 0.25 h, 0.5 h, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 8 h, 10 h, 24 h, 48 h; Cycle 1, Day 8 predose; all subsequent cycles predose on Day 1 and at end of treatment (EOT - up to approximately 2.5 years)|Apparent Plasma Clearance (CL/F) of RO6870810, Apparent clearance (CL/F) of RO6870810, where CL is clearance and F is bioavailability (relative amount of extravascularly-administered drug that reaches systemic circulation unchanged).
