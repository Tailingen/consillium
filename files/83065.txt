Neoadjuvant Prolgolimab Monotherapy in Locally Advanced MMR-deficient Colorectal Cancer
In this phase II study patients with stage II-III MSI/dMMR colorectal adenocarcinoma with no signs of distant metastases will be treated with immunotherapy (prolgolimab). The duration of treatment is 6 months (12 cycles)

In this open-label phase II non-randomized study the investigators will enroll 30 patients with stage II-III MSI/dMMR colorectal cancer to receive anti-PD1 inhibitor prolgolimab.

Patients will be treated with 12 cycles (6 months) of prolgolimab 1 mg/kg every 2 weeks until surgery.
