Vaccine Therapy for Multiple Myeloma Utilizing Idiotype-Pulsed Allogeneic Dendritic Cells
Patients with Multiple myeloma who have undergone non-myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplant will receive 6 vaccinations of donor derived dendritic cells combined with specific protein produced by multiple myeloma.
Multiple Myeloma
BIOLOGICAL: Idiotype-pulsed allogeneic dendritic cells
Patient will complete 4 vaccinations of monthly interval
Evaluation of immune response. Immune response analysis will be done on all patients who are enrolled in the study. Patients who completed a minimum of 4 vaccinations will be included in immune response.
To evaluate feasibility and safety of vaccination with allogeneic idiotype-pulsed dendritic cells following mixed chimeric allogeneic transplantation for multiple myeloma.
