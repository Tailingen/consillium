Cancer Fatigue Education Program
The purpose of the present project is to develop, implement and evaluate a pilot regional patient education program on the management of one of the main side effects of chemotherapy in cancer patients, that is fatigue.

A carer (doctor or nurse) trained in educational techniques will be responsible for the patient. The carer will first identify modes of behavior and competences that the patient must acquire in order to optimize his/her management of fatigue ("educational diagnosis"). An education program, based on a contract of goals will be proposed after this diagnosis phase. The expected results are, in the short-term, a significant reduction in the mean level of fatigue in patients receiving chemotherapy who benefited from individual educational management. In the longer term, the aim is to evaluate the impact of this program on patient quality of life and use of healthcare structures in comparison with conventional management.
Patient With Histologically Confirmed Malignancy
BEHAVIORAL: fatigue education program
Education program, The main indicator of patient satisfaction after the education program will be the change during 8 weeks of follow-up in the mean fatigue score measured on a specific scale (FACT-F) (32)., 8 weeks
self-evaluation, One secondary efficacy variables will comprise self-evaluation of patient quality of life measured using the SF-36 scale, 8 weeks|healthcare structures, The secondary efficacy variables will comprise evaluation of the use by patients of healthcare structures (phone calls, number of home visits, number of days of hospitalization, visits to emergency departments, other carers)., 8 weeks
