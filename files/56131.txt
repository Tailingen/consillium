S0413 Lapatinib in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Stomach Cancer
This phase II trial is studying how well lapatinib works in treating patients with locally advanced or metastatic stomach cancer. Lapatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth
Diffuse Adenocarcinoma of the Stomach|Intestinal Adenocarcinoma of the Stomach|Mixed Adenocarcinoma of the Stomach|Recurrent Gastric Cancer|Stage III Gastric Cancer|Stage IV Gastric Cancer
DRUG: lapatinib ditosylate|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis
Confirmed response probability (complete and partial), Up to 2 years
Time to treatment failure, From the date of registration to the date of first observation of progressive disease, death due to any cause, symptomatic deterioration, or early discontinuation of treatment, assessed up to 2 years|Overall survival, From date of registration to date of death due to any cause, assessed up to 2 years
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To assess the confirmed response (complete and partial) probability in patients with advanced/metastatic gastric cancer treated with GW572016.

II. To assess the time to treatment failure and overall survival in this group of patients.

III. To assess the qualitative and quantitative toxicities associated with this regimen.

IV. To assess, in a preliminary manner, the relationship of protein expression and gene expression of EGFR, HER2 and markers of angiogenesis with clinical outcomes in patients treated with GW572016.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive oral lapatinib once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for up to 2 years.
