A Study of Bevacizumab, Carboplatin, and Paclitaxel or Pemetrexed With or Without Atezolizumab in Chemotherapy-NaÃ¯ve Patients With Stage IV Non-Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (IMpower151)
This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab when given in combination with bevacizumab, investigator's choice of either paclitaxel or pemetrexed, and carboplatin compared with placebo given in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel or pemetrexed, and carboplatin in patients with chemotherapy-naive, Stage IV non-squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). The study will be conducted in two phases: Induction Phase and Maintenance Phase.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
DRUG: Atezolizumab|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Pemetrexed|DRUG: Carboplatin
Progression Free Survival (PFS) in the intent to treat (ITT) population, as determined by the investigator, PFS after randomization, defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause (whichever occurs first), as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1, Randomization until the first occurence of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occures first (up to approximately 33 months)
Overall Survival (OS) in the ITT population, OS after randomization, defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause., Randomization to death from any cause (up to approximately 33 months)|PFS in the ITT population, as determined by IRF, PFS after randomizationdefined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause (whichever occurs first), as determined by the an Independent Review Facility (IRF) according to RECIST v1.1, Randomization until the first occurence of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occures first (up to approximately 33 months)|PFS in subgroup of participants with PD-L1 Expression, as determined by the investigator, PFS after randomization as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1 in the subgroup of patients with PD-L1 expression defined by the SP263 immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay., Randomization until the first occurence of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occures first (up to approximately 33 months)|PFS in the subgroup of participants with genomic alterations in EGFR or ALK gene, as determined by the investigator, PFS after randomization as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1 in the subgroup of patients with genomic alterations in EGFR (i.e., sensitizing EGFR mutations) or ALK gene., Randomization until the first occurence of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occures first (up to approximately 33 months)|Objective Response Rate (ORR) in the ITT population, ORR, defined as the proportion of patients with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) on two consecutive occasions \>=4 weeks apart, as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1., Randomization until disease progression or death, which ever occurs first (up to approximately 33 months)|Duration of response (DOR) in the ITT population, DOR defined as the time from the first occurrence of a documented objective response to disease progression or death from any cause (whichever occurs first), as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1., Randomization until the first occurence of a documented objective response to disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occures first (up to approximately 33 months)|Time to Confirmed Deterioration (TTCD) in physical functioning in the ITT population, (TTCD) in physical functioning, defined as the time from randomization to the first observed \>=10-point decrease in the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30) for cancer linearly transformed physical functioning scale score that is sustained for two consecutive assessments or an initial clinically meaningful decrease above baseline followed by death within three weeks., Randomization up until approximately 33 months|Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events, Randomization up to approximately 33 months
