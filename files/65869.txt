De-convoluting Interactions Between Genes, the Cancer Environment, and the Immune System to Develop Therapies That Work for You
This is a live biobank study for breast cancer (BC) patients where samples will be collected at inflection points in the course of the disease.
Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: Live Biobank
establish a live biobank for breast cancer patients, Tumor tissue will be obtained at key inflection points from breast cancer patients (BC): at initial diagnosis, at surgery and at metastasis or recurrence.

Patient Derived Organoids (PDOs) will be prepared from tumors that are obtained from the BC patients., 60 months
assess immune relevant genes from tumor biopsies, comprehensively characterize the tumor from the biospecimen to determine the mutations, expression of immune related genes, and the quality and the spatial distribution of the immune infiltrate, 60 months
To test this hypothesis the investigators will focus on studying BC patients using an innovative approach, the DIGNITY Study (De-convoluting interactions between genes, the cancer environment, and the immune system to develop therapies that work for you) designed to building a live tissue biobank of Patient Derived Tumor Organoids (PDOs) derived from tumor at surgery, preceded or not by neoadjuvant therapy (NAT), and at recurrence/metastasis. BC patients enrolled in this study are consented to enable investigators to generate a biobank of tumor tissue (obtained from surgically removed excess that would otherwise be disposed off ) and matched blood cells ( obtained from an already existing line or a venipuncture ordered per standard of care testing) at key timepoints in their treatment course.
