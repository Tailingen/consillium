Prevalence of Cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr Virus and Human Herpes 6 Virus in Inflammatory Bowel Disease
An increase prevalence of CMV, EBV and or HHV-6 in diseased tissue of inflammatory bowel disease would suggest a role for these viruses in the etiology and/or exacerbation of IBD, whereas their absence would preclude such association.
Crohn's Disease|Ulcerative Colitis
Prevalence of Cytomegalovirus and Epstein Barr Virus in Patients with Mild to Moderate Inflammatory Bowel Disease compared to patients without inflammatory bowel disease, 0|Prevalence of Cytomegalovirus and Epstein Barr Virus in inflamed colonic tissue versus non inflamed tissues from Patients with Mild to Moderate Inflammatory., 0|Prevalence of Cytomegalovirus and Epstein Barr Virus in inflamed colonic tissue from patient with mild to moderate IBD as compared to inflamed mucosa from patients with other inflammatory diseases of the colon, 0
The protocol is designed to evaluate the following objectives:

1. The prevalence of cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr virus and human herpes 6 virus DNA in inflamed intestinal mucosa of patients with Crohn's colitis and ulcerative colitis compared to their prevalence in healthy intestinal mucosa of patients not affected by these conditions;
2. To evaluate the prevalence of cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr virus and human herpes 6 virus DNA in the intestinal mucosa of patients with Crohn's colitis and ulcerative colitis compared to that in inflamed mucosa caused by other conditions (non specific colitis);
3. To compare the prevalence of cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr virus and human herpes 6 virus DNA in inflamed and healthy tissue in the same patients with Crohn's colitis and ulcerative colitis;
4. To determine whether the presence of cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr virus and human herpes 6 virus DNA detected by nPCR correlates with immunohistochemical detection of viral protein in colonic tissue.
5. To determine whether the relative viral quantity of CMV, EBV or HHV-6 is related to severity of disease activity.
