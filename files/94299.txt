Evaluation of Specific Biomarkers in Primary Invasive Breast Cancer
This study will examine specific biomarkers in primary invasive breast cancer and explore their correlation with patient outcome following standard neoadjuvant treatment.
Neoplasms, Breast
The presence of a specific predictive gene expression signature in tumor tissues, At randomization and at definitive surgery which may be up to 30 weeks post randomization.|The presence of immune infiltration in tumor tissues, At randomization and at definitive surgery which may be up to 30 weeks post randomization.|The presence of other candidate biomarkers in tumor tissues, At randomization and at definitive surgery which may be up to 30 weeks post randomization.|The pathological response (complete response or partial response) in the breast., At definitive surgery which may be up to 30 weeks post randomization.|Disease free interval, Time from definitive surgery to the date of first recurrence of the disease up to maximally 6 years.|Disease free survival, Time from definitive surgery to either the date of first recurrence of the disease or the date of death (whatever the cause), whichever occurs first, up to maximally 6 years.|Overall survival, Time from definitive surgery to the date of death, irrespective of the cause of death. Patients still alive will be censored at the date of the last contact up to maximally 6 years.
