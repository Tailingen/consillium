Treatment of Pancreatic Cancer With Abraxane
This observational program collects data on tolerability, safety and efficacy regarding the use of Abraxane in metastatic pancreatic cancer patients in the daily clinical routine. Additionally data on dosage that is actually used in these patients will be collected. Patients who have pancreatic cancer and additional diseases can be documented in this study, too. Collected data might generate learnings on the optimal use of Abraxane in the daily routine setting.

Number of participants with adverse events, An AE is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the subject's health, including laboratory test values, regardless of etiology., Up to 5 years
Best Overall Response, Tumor response will be summarized as the percentage of participants who achieve a confirmed complete (CR) or partial response (PR)., Up to 5 years
This observational program is aimed at gaining tolerability, safety and efficacy data with the routine use of Abraxane in its labeled indication in metastatic pancreatic cancer. Additionally data on real life dosing in daily clinical routine will be analyzed.

A detailed record of the medical history including co-morbidities and pre-treatment regimens will allow analysis of the impact thereof on tolerability, dosage and efficacy.

Hands-on experience with nab-paclitaxel is very limited in Austria and an non-interventional study could enhance knowledge on optimal drug handling and Adverse Event management.
