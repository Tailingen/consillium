Phase IV Trial to Evaluate Breast Brachytherapy Using the Mammosite-Ml®
This study will evaluate the local control rate, cosmetic results, and complication rates of breast brachytherapy delivered using the MammoSite-ML® when used as the sole method of radiation therapy or as a boost technique for patients with stage I-II carcinoma of the breast (\< 3 cm), (non-lobular histology) treated with lumpectomy with histologically negative surgical margins by at least 2 mm, negative axillary lymph nodes, and DCIS.

Hypotheses:

* For selected patients with stage I breast carcinoma and Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS), radiation therapy delivered with brachytherapy alone using the MammoSite-ML® is technically feasible and reproducible with acceptable complication rates.
* Cosmetic results after brachytherapy will be similar to that obtained after traditional whole breast external beam radiation therapy.
* Local tumor control rate in the breast after brachytherapy will be similar to that of conventional external beam radiation therapy, with less inconvenience and potentially less cost to the patient, given the selection criteria which minimize the risk of clinically significant multicentric or extensive residual carcinoma following lumpectomy.

Ipsilateral Recurrence Rate, * Local recurrence is defined as either invasive or non-invasive breast cancer recurrence within the target volume.
* Elsewhere recurrence is defined as either invasive or non-invasive breast cancer recurrence outside of the target volume.
* Local control rate will be evaluated by imaging techniques, physical exam and biopsy, if applicable.

Measured as a count of participants experiencing recurrence, i.e. each subject experiencing ipsilateral tumor recurrence within 5 years = 1, and each subject with no ipsilateral tumor recurrence within 5 years = 0, 5 years
Cosmetic Results, Evaluation of cosmetic results as judged by the patient, surgeon, and radiation oncologist at stated follow up intervals. Serial photographs will be obtained. The cosmetic results will be assessed using the four category Harvard Scale definitions: Excellent - The treated breast looks essentially the same as the opposite breast Good - Minimal but identifiable effects of radiation on the treated breast Fair - Significant effects of radiation on the treated breast Poor - Severe normal tissue sequelae secondary to irradiation, 6 months after treatment, then annually for 5 years|Toxicity Measured Through Adverse Event Incidence, The incidence of serious adverse events will be calculated. Adverse events reviewed for device harm/toxicity include skin redness, breast pain, infections, breast swelling, and rib fractures., during therapy, 6 weeks after completion of therapy, and additionally as needed
