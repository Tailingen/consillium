NEO: Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy, Excision and Observation for Early Rectal Cancer
The purpose of this study is to find out the effects of chemotherapy followed by less invasive surgery on patients and their early rectal cancer. The approach of this trial will be considered a success if at least 65% of participants are able to keep the rectum.
Rectal Cancer
DRUG: Folfox Protocol|DRUG: Capox
Percentage of Organ Preservation, Defined as the percentage of patients with tumour downstaging to ypT0/T1good N0 and who avoid radical surgery., 3 years
Percentage of Locoregional Relapses at 3 Years, Locoregional relapse is defined as reappearance of a tumour within the rectum or pelvis. The percentage of loco-reginal relapse at 3 years was estimated by Kaplan-Meier method for the survival function of the loco-regional relapse free survival, defined as the time from enrollment to the first date of definitive evidence (clinical, radiological or pathological) of locoregional relapses with patients who developed distant relapse only, died, loss to follow up, or were alive at clinical cut-off censored at respectively at last date of distant relapses, date of death, date of lost to follow-up, or last disease assessment date., 3 years|Percentage of Distant Relapse at 3 Years, Distant relapse is defined as appearance of rectal cancer disease at sites remote from the rectum. The percentage of distant relapse at 3 years was estimated also by Kaplan-Meier method for the survival function of the distant free survival, defined as the time from enrollment to the first date of definitive evidence (clinical, radiological or pathological) of distant relapses with patients who died, loss to follow up, or were alive at clinical cut-off censored at respectively: date of death, date of lost to follow-up, and last disease assessment date., 3 years|Percentage of Disease Free at 3 Years, Percentage of disease free at 3 years was estimated by Kaplan-Meier method for the survival function of Disease-Free Survival (DFS), which is defined as the interval from date of enrollment to the first date of the events defined below:

* Locoregional relapse
* Distant relapse
* Non-protocol radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or biologic therapy without documentation of the site of failure
* Death due to any other reason. Patients who were alive without locoregional or distant relapse or receiving non-protocol radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or biologic therapy without documentation of the site of failure at the clinical data cutoff date were censored at their last disease assessment date.

  3 year disease free survival was estimated by Kaplan-Meier method., 3 years|Rate of Intraoperative Complications, Percentage of patients with at least one intraoperative injury, 1 day
The purpose of this study is to find out the effects of chemotherapy followed by less invasive surgery on patients and their early rectal cancer. The approach of this trial will be considered a success if at least 65% of participants are able to keep the rectum.
