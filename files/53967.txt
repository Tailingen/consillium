Efficacy Study of Blinatumomab Clean Up Early Residual Disease for Newly Diagnosed Pediatric B Lymphoblastic Leukemia
The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy of Blinatumomab in pediatric patient with newly diagnosed acute B-Lymphoblastic leukemia with poor response to early chemotherapy, i.e. day 19 MRD ≥ 0.1% (low-risk) or day 19 MRD ≥ 0.01% (intermediate-risk). The main question is:

• If the flow cytometric MRD negative (\<0.01%) rate and the NGS- MRD negative (\<0.0001%) rate at the end of induction for patients received Blinatumomab will be superior to historical control (D46MRD in the CCCG-ALL2020 protocol).

Participants will:

* Take 14 days full dose Blinatumomab;
* With bone marrow evaluated before and after Blinatumomab treatment.
B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia
DRUG: Blinatumomab
The flow cytometric MRD, The flow cytometric MRD negative (\<0.01%) rate at the end of induction for patients received Blinatumomab will superior to historical control (D46MRD in the CCCG-ALL2020 protocol), From the date of Blinatumomab completion to one week after its treatment course|The NGS- MRD, The NGS- MRD negative (\<0.0001%) rate at the end of induction for patients received Blinatumomab will superior to historical control (D46MRD in the CCCG-ALL2020 protocol), From the date of Blinatumomab completion to one week after its treatment course
5-year EFS, The 5-year EFS of study group was significantly higher than that of the control group., 5 years since the last recruited patient completed Blinatumomab.|Adverse events, Comparison of adverse events in study and control groups, From day 19 of induction therapy until the start of the second high-dose methotrexate regimen.|Healthcare costs, Comparison of healthcare costs in study and control groups, Six-month since window phase
Effects of Blinatumomab on immune function, Immune cell subgroup, T-cell activation, depletion, and cytokine releasing will be studied before Blinatumomab and day 7 and day 14 during Blinatumomab, and 1 week after Blinatumomab discontinuation., From the day of or before Blinatumomab to 3-7 days after termination of Blinatumomab.
