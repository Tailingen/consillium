ctDNA-Guided De-Escalation of Adjuvant Chemotherapy With Dalpiciclib in HR-Positive/HER2-Negative Breast Cancer
* This is a Phase II, multicenter, randomized clinical trial evaluating a ctDNA-guided approach to de-escalate adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, HER2-negative early-stage breast cancer. The study aims to determine if combining the CDK4/6 inhibitor Dalpiciclib with endocrine therapy can reduce the need for chemotherapy while maintaining clinical benefits.
* Key Details ：

  1. Participants: 393 women (aged 18-75) with early-stage HR+/HER2- breast cancer at high risk of recurrence (e.g., tumor size ≥2 cm, lymph node involvement, or high-grade tumors).
  2. Design: Patients are randomized 1:4 to two groups:

     Group A (Chemotherapy) : Receives 4 cycles of taxane-based chemotherapy before surgery.

     Group B (Experimental) : Receives Dalpiciclib + aromatase inhibitor (AI) for 4 cycles pre-surgery.

     Post-surgery, treatment is adjusted based on ctDNA results.
  3. Primary Goals ： Assess ctDNA clearance rate (conversion from detectable to undetectable ctDNA) after neoadjuvant therapy in Group B.

     Evaluate 3-year event-free survival (EFS) in Group B (e.g., freedom from cancer recurrence, progression, or death).

     Secondary Goals ： Safety of Dalpiciclib + endocrine therapy. Tumor response rates (e.g., complete cell cycle arrest, pathological remission).

     Correlation between ctDNA clearance and long-term outcomes.
* Why This Matters ： Current guidelines recommend chemotherapy for high-risk HR+ breast cancer, but it often causes significant side effects. This study explores a personalized approach using ctDNA-a blood-based biomarker-to identify patients who may safely avoid chemotherapy without compromising survival. If successful, it could shift clinical practice toward less toxic, targeted therapies for eligible patients.

- 1. Scientific Background and Rationale： Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality globally, with hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative (HER2-) subtypes accounting for approximately 70% of cases. While adjuvant chemotherapy is standard for high-risk early-stage HR+/HER2- breast cancer, it carries significant toxicity, and many patients may not derive clinical benefit. Emerging evidence suggests that circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)-a minimally invasive biomarker reflecting residual disease-may guide personalized treatment de-escalation.

Preclinical and clinical studies demonstrate that ctDNA dynamics correlate with tumor burden and prognosis. In HR+ breast cancer, ctDNA clearance after neoadjuvant therapy is associated with improved survival, while persistent ctDNA post-treatment predicts recurrence. CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as Dalpiciclib, have revolutionized advanced HR+/HER2- breast cancer management by enhancing endocrine therapy efficacy. However, their role in early-stage disease, particularly in a ctDNA-guided de-escalation strategy, remains underexplored. This study addresses this gap by evaluating whether ctDNA-driven decision-making can safely reduce chemotherapy use while maintaining clinical outcomes.
