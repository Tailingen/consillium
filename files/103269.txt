GPC2 CAR T Cells for Relapsed or Refractory Neuroblastoma
This is a first in human dose escalation trial to determine the safety of administering GPC2 CAR T cells in patients with advanced neuroblastoma.
Refractory Neuroblastoma|Relapsed Neuroblastoma|High-risk Neuroblastoma
BIOLOGICAL: GPC2 CAR T cells
Determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose of GPC2 CAR T cells, The Maximum Tolerated Dose of GPC2 CAR T cells will be determined by measuring the incidence of dose limiting toxicities following administration of the product., 5 years|Frequency of Adverse Events Following GPC2 CAR T cell administration, Assess the frequency and severity of treatment related adverse events following administration of GPC2 CAR T cells., 5 years
Manufacturing Feasibility of GPC2 CAR T cells, Manufacturing Feasibility will be evaluated as the Percentage of patients with GPC2 CAR T cell products that meet release criteria, 5 years|Persistence of GPC2 CAR T cells, Persistence of GPC2 CAR T cells will be measured by Polymerase Chain Reaction (or flow cytometry) analysis of whole blood to detect and quantify survival of GPC2 CAR T cells over time., 5 years|Preliminarily define the clinical activity of GPC2 CAR T in patients with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma, Overall Response Rate will be determined based on international Neuroblastoma Response Criteria, 5 years|Severity of Adverse Events Following GPC2 CAR T cell administration., The safety of GPC2 CAR T cell therapy reinfusions will be measured by the monitoring the frequency and severity of adverse events after multipleGPC2 CAR T cells infusions., 5 years
Despite the use of intensive multimodal chemoradiotherapy, surgery, autologous stem cell transplant and disialoganglioside antigen (GD2)-targeted immunotherapy for the treatment of patients with high-risk neuroblastoma, approximately 60% of children still die from this disease and survivors suffer lifelong treatment related comorbidities. For patients who suffer a relapse after receiving therapy with standard of care multimodality treatment, there are no known curative options. Glypican 2 (GPC2) is highly expressed on the plasma membrane of most high-risk neuroblastomas, is further enriched in the tumor stem cell compartment, but is not expressed at significant levels on normal tissues, making it an ideal target for immune directed therapies. To therapeutically leverage GPC2's differential expression, a GPC2-directed CAR T cell therapy that potently inhibits the growth of neuroblastoma patient-derived xenografts has been developed. This investigation will be a single institution, open-label first in human, dose escalation and expansion study designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and manufacturing feasibility of GPC2 CAR T cells.
