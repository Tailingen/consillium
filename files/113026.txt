Pilot Study of Topotecan/Vincristine With Subconjunctival Carboplatin for Patients With Bilateral Retinoblastoma
The investigators are testing subtenon carboplatin in combination with vincristine and topotecan given by vein in the hopes of finding a drug combination that may be effective against retinoblastoma that has come back (recurrent) or is resistant to other treatment (refractory).

The goals of this study are:

* To decide if the drug combination is a useful treatment for recurrent or refractory retinoblastoma
* To test the safety of the drug combination and to see what kind of effects (good and bad) can be expected from the drug combination
* To measure visual changes before and after the study therapy
* To use a special MRI scan to measure brain function involved in vision processing, both before and after the study therapy

In this study, the investigators are also testing a new experimental way of giving carboplatin "subtenon carboplatin". The carboplatin will be given directly in the eye through a needle placed under the covering of the eye. This is to try to get more carboplatin to the retinoblastoma inside the eye.
