IRIS Followed by mFOLFOX6 or the Reverse Sequence in Advanced Colorectal Cancer
This randomized phase III study compares safety and efficacy of two sequence arms in advanced colorectal cancer: irinotecan and S-1 (IRIS) followed by oxaliplatin containing regimen (arm A), or l-leucovorin (l-LV), 5-FU and oxaliplatin (mFOLFOX6) followed by irinotecan containing regimen (arm B).
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Campto, Topotesin|DRUG: TS-1|DRUG: L-Plat|DRUG: Isovorin|DRUG: 5-FU
PFS of 1st line treatment, 2-years
OS, 4-years|objective tumor response, 1-year|PFS of 2nd line treatment, 1-year|safety, 4-years
A multicenter randomized open-label controlled phase III study is conducted in patients with inoperable advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer who receive no previous chemotherapy. Usefulness of IRIS and mFOLFOX6 regimens as the 1st-line therapy for colorectal cancer is evaluated in PFS, MST, incidence and severity of adverse events
