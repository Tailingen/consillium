Analysis of Influencing Factors of Preoperative Frailty in Elderly Patients With Gastric Cancer Based on the Health Ecology Theory
Frailty is common in patients with gastric cancer undergoing surgical treatment. Preoperative frailty can lead to many adverse outcomes in patients after surgery. This study aims to comprehensively and systematically analyze the influencing factors of preoperative frailty in patients with gastric cancer based on the health ecology theory , to change some critical variable factors in the future, improving the overall prognosis of patients.
