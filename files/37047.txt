Alternative Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Resectable and Borderline Resectable Pancreatic Cancer
Using alternative neoadjuvant gemcitabine-nab-paclitaxel and nal-IRI with 5-Fluorouracil (5FU) and folinic acid (Leucovorin) regimens of localized cancer, we hope to ensure exposure of the cancer to a broader array of potentially active agents. Also, potentially improves patient tolerance and minimizes significant drug toxicity that could impair delivery of all treatment elements. Furthermore, it may enable prediction of superior to inferior treatment outcomes at an earlier point in the disease progress.
Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: nab paclitaxel|DRUG: Onivyde|DRUG: Leucovorin|DRUG: 5-fu
Treatment safety as assessed by CTCAE v4.03, Toxicities are evaluated according to CTCAE v4.03, An average of 1 year
Overall survival, OS is defined as the time between the date of enrollment and the date of death (whatever the cause)., 5 years|Progression free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time between the date of enrollment and the date of the first radiological and/or pathological progression. Progression is assessed by investigator according to RECIST v1.1 criteria., 5 years|Response rate, Response rate will be assessed per RECIST v1.1 criteria and CA19-9 over the entire treatment period., An average of 1 year
This research study is a Phase Ib clinical trial. It will assess the Safety, tolerability, and feasibility of gemcitabine-nab paclitaxel alternating with nal-IRI/5FU/leucovorin (NAPOLI) in de novo resectable and borderline resectable pancreatic cancer.

Subjects must have a newly diagnosed resectable or borderline resectable pancreatic ductal cancer and meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria.

Treatment consists of 4 week treatment cycles. Nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine will be administered on days 1,8, and 15 with NAPOLI will be administered on days 1 and 15.
