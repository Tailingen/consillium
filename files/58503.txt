The University of Miami Adapt (UAdapt) Trial
The Miami UAdapt Trial is a non-comparative, risk adapted, parallel, randomized, phase 2 study for patients with favorable-intermediate to very high risk non-metastatic prostate cancer with the primary objective of assessing the efficacy and modulation of response of Lattice Extreme Ablative Dose (LEAD) RT with and without androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) at a multidimensional level.
Prostate Cancer
RADIATION: FTLEAD|DRUG: Ultra-Short-Term Androgen Deprivation Therapy with Relugolix|RADIATION: HypoLEAD|DRUG: ADT Standard of Care
Proportion of Patients with Biochemical Disease Failure (FFBN9mo), Biochemical Disease Failure will be determined by the proportion of patients with biochemical disease failure., Up to 14 Months|Proportion of Patients with Clinical Disease Failure, Clinical Disease Failure will be determined by the proportion of patients with clinical disease failure. Clinical disease failure will include the proportion of patients with biopsy finding of treatment failure., Up to 14 Months
Proportion of Patients with Biochemical Disease Failure (Phoenix definition), Biochemical Disease Failure will be determined by the proportion of patients with biochemical disease failure., Up to 2.5 years|Proportion of Patients with Clinical Disease Failure, Clinical Disease Failure will be determined by the proportion of patients with clinical disease failure. Clinical disease failure will include the proportion of patients with biopsy finding of treatment failure., Up to 2.5 years|Proportion of Patients with Pathology-determined complete response (PathCR), Pathology-determined complete response (PathCR) is defined as proportion of patients with negative prostate biopsy findings on both template plus image-guided habitat biopsy., Up to 2.0-2.5 years after all treatment|Proportion of Patients with Pathology-determined complete response (PathCR), Pathology-determined complete response (PathCR) is defined as proportion of patients with negative prostate biopsy findings on both template plus image-guided habitat biopsy., Up to 2.5 year|Incidence of Failure rate (FR), Failure rate is defined as the cumulative incidence of biopsy finding of treatment failure (BxTF), biochemical failure (BF), or clinical failure (CF), or combined (BxTF plus BF plus CF), where combined failure refers to documented evidence of BxTF, BF, and CF occurring within 6 months of each other with the earlier date used, or death related to prostate cancer without prior evidence of failure, whichever is earlier, from study enrollment allowing for competing risk as needed., Up to 2.5 years|Number of Treatment Related Acute toxicity, Acute toxicity is defined as grade 2+ and grade 3+ treatment-related acute genitourinary (GU)/gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity occurring during treatment and within 3 months of completing treatment. The severity of the reactions to treatment will be scored according to the criteria outline in CTCAE version 5.0., Up to 3 months|Number of Treatment Related Late toxicity, Late toxicity is defined as grade 2+ and grade 3+ treatment-related GU/GI toxicity occurring more than 3 months after completing study treatment. The severity of the reactions to treatment will be scored according to the criteria outline in CTCAE version 5.0., Up to 8 Years
