NeoadjuVAnt muLti-agENT Chemotherapy or Patritumab Deruxtecan With or Without endocrINE Therapy for High-risk HR+/HER2- Breast Cancer - VALENTINE Trial
VALENTINE is a parallel, non-comparative, three-arm, randomized 1:2:2 open-label, multicenter, exploratory study in women or men with primary operable HR+/HER2-negative breast cancer with ki67 ≥ 20% and/or high genomic risk (defined by gene signature) aiming at evaluating the clinical benefit and biological effects of HER3-DXd with/without letrozole as a neoadjuvant treatment regimen.

The primary aim is to evaluate the ability of each treatment strategy to achieve a pCR at surgery. This study is exploratory and no formal comparison between treatment arms is intended. The inclusion of a chemotherapy treatment arm serves as an internal response control instead of using historical data as comparators. In addition, the chemotherapy control arm is the standard of care appropriate treatment in these patients, to include this arm will ensure the recruitment of the target patient population (patients should have indication for neoadjuvant chemotherapy) and allowing comparison of secondary endpoint such as safety and/or HrQoL.

Rate of Residual cancer burden (RCB) category status (0, I, II, III), assessed by a local pathologist at surgery according to the MD Anderson Cancer Center recommendations., before treatment and surgery|pCRB (pathological complete response in the breast), defined as the complete absence of invasive carcinoma in the breast on histological examination after treatment, irrespective of in situ carcinoma in the breast., before treatment and surgery|Tumor overall objective response rate (ORR), defined as the proportion of subjects with a Partial Responses (PR) or a Complete Responses (CR) according to RECIST v1.1 as per Investigator's assessments by breast MRI, before treatment and pre-surgery|iDFS rate, iDFS defined as the time from randomization to any of the following events:

* Ipsilateral invasive breast tumor recurrence (IIBTR): invasive breast cancer involving the same breast parenchyma as the original primary.
* Regional invasive breast cancer recurrence: Invasive breast cancer in the axilla, regional lymph nodes, chest wall, and skin of the ipsilateral breast.
* Distant recurrence: Metastatic disease-breast cancer that has either been biopsy confirmed or clinically diagnosed as recurrent invasive breast cancer.
* Death attributable to any cause, including breast cancer, non-breast cancer, or unknown cause.
* Contralateral invasive breast cancer.
* Second primary non-breast invasive cancer.
* Progression during neoadjuvant treatment., 3 years follow-up and 5 years follow-up|CelTIL score changes, CelTIL score (CelTIL = = -0.8 × tumor cellularity (in %) + 1.3 × TILs (in %), from baseline to C2D1|HER3 receptor expression and ERBB3 mRNA expression level, HER3 receptor expression levels by IHC and ERBB3 mRNA expression level by gene expression., from baseline to C2D1|Proliferation, changes in ki67 IHC, from baseline to C2D1|Quality of Life assessed by EORTC-BR45 changes, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer's (EORTC) core quality for assessing quality of life in breast cancer patients (EORTC-BR45). QLQ-BR45 is used to measure HRQoL within the preceding 7 days or 28 days depending on the items. The EORTC QLQ-BR45 is a questionnaire consisting of 45 items where each item is scored using a 4-point scale (1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much)., from baseline until 30 days after the surgery visit|Quality of Life assessed by EORTC QLQ-C30 changes, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer's (EORTC) core quality of life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30, version 3.0).
