Study of Near-Infrared Imaging With Indocyanine Green for Detection of Sentinel Lymph Nodes in People With Vulvar Cancer
The purpose of this study is to compare two types of imaging for sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping in people with early-stage vulvar cancer. The researchers will compare indocyanine green near-infrared (ICG-NIR) imaging with lymphoscintigraphy. All participants in this study will be scheduled for standard surgical treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK). This surgical treatment includes SLN mapping (with both lymphoscintigraphy and ICG-NIR imaging) and SLN biopsy.
Vulvar Cancer
PROCEDURE: ICG guided sentinel lymph node biopsy
success of identifying the SLN, by use of near-infrared imaging with ICG injection. Patients will be eligible for assessment if they undergo attempted SLN mapping by lymphoscintigraphy and near-infrared imaging with ICG injection. The primary endpoint is the accurate identification of the SLN, defined as the uptake of ICG in the proximalmost draining lymph node in the inguinofemoral chain. Evaluate the ability of near-infrared imaging with ICG injection to detect the inguinofemoral SLN in patients with early-stage vulvar cancer, compared with radiocolloid lymphoscintigraphy, the current standard., 18 months
