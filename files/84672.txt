Assessment of Chemotherapy-induced Peripheral Neurotoxicity Using a Point-of-care Nerve Conduction Study Device
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of the Mediracer® NCS device in early detection of CIPN in patients receiving potentially neurotoxic substance (vincristine, oxaliplatin or docetaxel) as a part of their chemotherapy regimen.
