Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) Versus ADT Plus Prostate Cryotherapy for Metastatic Prostate Cancer (mPCa)
Patients with primary diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer are randomly divided into two groups. One group receive standard of care ADT continually.

The primary endpoint of this study is prostate cancer Progression-Free Survival. The secondary endpoint is overall survival, prostate cancer specific survival and health-related quality of life.
