A Study of E7389 in Advanced/Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients
The purpose of this study is to determine if E7389 is a safe and effective treatment for advanced/metastatic breast cancer.
Breast Neoplasms
DRUG: E7389
Overall Response Rate Based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), Defined as the percentage of subjects with CR or PR from the start of treatment until disease progression or recurrence. Lesions measured by computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Objective response rate: complete response (CR-disappearance of all lesions)+ partial response (PR-30% decrease in lesion diameter), Progressive Disease (PD-20% increase in lesion diameter), stable disease (SD-neither shrinkage nor increase of lesions)., Confirmed 4 to 8 weeks after first observed
Duration of Response, Measured from the time measurement criteria were met for complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) (whichever was first recorded) until the first date that recurrent progressive disease was objectively documented (taking as a reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started)., From CR or partial response PR (whichever recorded first) to date of recurrent or progressive disease|Progression Free Survival, Defined as the time from start of study drug administration until progressive disease or death from any cause during the study period in the absence of disease progression., From start of study drug administration to progressive disease or death|Overall Survival, Defined as the time from the start of study drug administration until death from any cause, From start of study drug administration to death|Change From Baseline to Study Termination in Quality of Life Measures Using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B) Scores, The FACT-B questionnaire consists of 36 questions each scored from 0-4. The total score is calculated by summing these scores. The total possible range is from 0 to 144. The higher scores indicate a better health-related quality of life. This measures emotional, functional, physical, and social well being as well as concerns specific to patients with breast cancer., At Screening, Day 1 of each cycle, and 30 days after last dose of study drug
The primary objective is to determine the response rate (RR) to E7389 monotherapy administered as an IV bolus of 1.4 mg/m\^2 on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-Day cycle and on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle in patients with advanced/metastatic breast cancer treated with chemotherapy including an anthracycline and a taxane, with previously documented progression during or within six months following the last dose of prior chemotherapy.

The secondary objectives are to evaluate:

* The safety and tolerability of E7389 monotherapy in this patient population;
* The antitumor activity of E7389 as determined by duration of response, time to progression, and overall survival;
* Quality of life measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B) questionnaire/tumor-related symptom improvement or worsening measured by pain intensity on a visual analog scale (VAS), analgesics consumption, weight changes and performance status (PS);
* Tumor pharmacogenetics and their possible relationship to response (assessment of beta-tubulin isotype mRNA on biopsy sample) in patients who have signed a separate consent form
