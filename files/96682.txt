Weekly BI 836880 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a Phase I, multi-centre, non-randomized, uncontrolled, open-label, dose escalating study of BI 836880 administered intravenously once a week. The eligible patient population will be patients with advanced solid tumors.

The primary objective of this trial is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase II doses for BI 836880 in patients with solid tumors. Preliminary safety data will be evaluated as secondary objectives.

Subsequently, pharmacokinetic profile, pharmacodynamic changes in circulating biomarkers and Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( DCE-MRI), anti-tumor activity and the immunogenicity of BI 836880 will be explored up to a total of 40 patients with advanced solid tumors.

Dose escalation will be guided by a Bayesian logistic regression model with over dose control (EWOC) using at least 2 patients per dose cohorts.

Safety criteria will be followed, including adverse events according to Common Terminology Criteria (CTCAE version 4.03), incidence of dose limiting toxicities, physical examination, vital signs, safety laboratory parameters and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG).
Neoplasms
DRUG: BI 836880
The primary endpoint is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) based on the number of patients presenting dose limiting toxicity (DLT) using CTCAE V4.03, during the first course and judged to be related to the study medication, up to 6 months
Drug related Adverse Events (AEs) leading to dose reduction or discontinuation during treatment period, up to 6 months
