Incidental Finding of Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors (GISTs) During Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy, How to Deal? How Much Safety Margin
LSG is thought to be the best choice for obese patients with conincidental GISTs, as a tumour can be resected along with resecting the stomach within the same procedure. The primary endpoint is that, how much does GIST suppose to be far from a staple line to do safe laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy
Excision Margin
PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy
Excision of GIST during LSG, we analyzed the incidence of GISTs in patients underwent LSG and investigated whether simultaneous resection can be oncologically adequate. as long as GIST is distal to staple line with a negative margin, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy can be done safely., 4 years from start of study
The incidence of unsuspected GIST in LSG specimens in our series was high in comparison to cases reported in the literature.

GISTs could be safely removed laparoscopically during LSG surgery with negative microscopic resection margins, with 1-2cm safety margin. Margins less than 1cm, high mitotic rate are adverse prognostic factors.

Examining the whole stomach before resection is mandatory and can easily be done during LSG, GIST can be removed safely with LSG
