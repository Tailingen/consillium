Using Digestive Microbial Information to Enhance the Early Detection of Pancreatic Cancer
Pancreatic cancer (PCA) is a leading death-related cancer. There is an urgent need for accurate, noninvasive diagnostic options in the early detection of pancreatic cancer (PCA), since delayed diagnosis increases the risk of metastasis and recurrence. In this study, by analyzing gut and fecal microbial data among the pancreatic versus healthy populations, we aim to establish an early detection tool to improve PCA detection, and to explore potential diagnostic biomarkers.
