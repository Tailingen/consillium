Phase I/II Trial of CPX-351 + Palbociclib in Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Palbociclib in combination with investigational (experimental) drug, CPX-351 and evaluate the efficacy of Palbociclib in combination with chemotherapy as measured by overall response rate (ORR), i.e. complete response (CR) and CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) by 2003 IWG criteria.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia|AML
DRUG: Palcociclib|DRUG: CPX-351
Safety and Tolerability of Experimental Dose of Palbociclibin Combination With CPX-351 as Measured by Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities., If Grade 3-4 non-hematologic toxicity is observed in 1 or less of 6 patients treated, the dose of the study drug will be considered safe/tolerable. If Grade 3-4 non-hematologic toxicity is observed in 2 or more of 6 patients treated, 6 additional patients will be treated on the Phase IIa portion at a lower dose level (100 mg po)., Between days 28-35 of starting treatment|Efficacy of Palbociclibin Combination With Chemotherapy as Measured by Overall Response Rate (ORR)., Efficacy of Palbociclibin combination with chemotherapy as measured by overall response rate (ORR) which is defined as complete response (CR) and CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) by IWG criteria.

Complete remission is defined as: Bone marrow blasts \<5%; absence ofcirculating blasts and blasts with Auerrods; absence of extramedullarydisease; absolute neutrophil count \>1.0x 109/L (1,000/μL); platelet count \>100 x109/L (100,000/μL)

and

CR with incomplete blood count recovery is defined as: All CR criteria except for residualneutropenia \[\<1.0 x 109/L (1,000/μL)\] orthrombocytopenia \[\<100 x 109/L(100,000/μL)\].

Either of these responses will constitute ORR., Up to 2 years from end of treatment, up to 27 months
Time to Response (TTR), TTR is defined as the time it takes from the start date of the treatment to the date of achievement of response (as per the definition of response mentioned in the 2003 IWG criteria)., Up to 2 years from end of treatment|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is measured between the date of response to date of loss of response., Up to 2 years from end of treatment|Event-free Survival (EFS), EFS measured from the date of entry into a study to the date of primary refractory disease, or relapse from CR, or CRi, or death from any cause; patients not known to have any of these events are censored on the date they were last examined, Up to 2 years from end of treatment|Overall Survival (OS) Probability, OS probability measured from the date of entry into a clinical trial to the date of death from any cause; patients not known to have died at last follow-up are censored on the date they were last known to be alive, Up to 2 years from end of treatment, up to 27 months
The objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Palbociclibin combination with CPX-351, and to evaluate the efficacy of Palbociclibin combination with chemotherapy as measured by overall response rate (ORR), i.e. complete response (CR) and CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) by IWG criteria.

CPX-351 is an investigational drug that works as formulation of a fixed combination of the antineoplastic (acting to prevent, inhibit or halt the development of a neoplasm (a tumor)) drugs cytarabine and daunorubicin.

Palbociclibis an investigational drug that works to induce early G1 arrest by inhibiting CDK4/6, which are two types of CDKs that are overexpressed in AML cell cancer lines.

CPX-351 and Palbociclib is experimental because it is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

This is a single arm, open label study of the combination of Palbociclib with CPX-351 in adults with AML. The trial consists of two components: phase I to evaluate the safety with dose escalation of Palbociclib in combination with CPX-351 and phase II to evaluate the overall response rate of the combination in the targeted participant population.
