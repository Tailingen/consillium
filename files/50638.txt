A Study of Atezolizumab With Lenvatinib or Sorafenib Versus Lenvatinib or Sorafenib Alone in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Previously Treated With Atezolizumab and Bevacizumab
This is a Phase III, open-label, multicenter, randomized, two-arm study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab plus either lenvatinib or sorafenib versus lenvatinib or sorafenib alone in participants with locally advanced or metastatic Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) who have progressed on prior systemic treatment with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab combination.
Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: Atezolizumab|DRUG: Lenvatinib|DRUG: Sorafenib
Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from randomization into the study to death from any cause., Randomization until death from any cause (approximately 42 months)
Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from randomization into the study to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause (whichever occurs first)., Randomization until the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause whichever occurs first (approximately 42 months)|Confirmed Objective Response Rate (ORR), Confirmed Objective Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of patients with a best response of either complete or partial response., Approximately 42 months|Time to Progression (TTP), Time to Progression (TTP) is defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression., Randomization until the first occurrence of disease progression (approximately 42 months)|Duration of Response (DOR), Duration of Response (DOR) is defined as the time from the first occurrence of a documented confirmed objective response to disease progression or death from any cause (whichever occurs first)., Time from the first occurrence of a confirmed documented objective response to disease progression or death from any cause whichever occurs first (approximately 42 months)|Time to confirmed deterioration (TTCD), Time to confirmed deterioration (TTCD), of health-related quality of life (HRQoL), is defined as the time from randomization to first confirmed deterioration (decrease from baseline of â‰¥ 10 points) maintained for two consecutive assessments, or one assessment followed by death from any cause within 3 weeks (if Cycle 1-6) or 6 weeks (if after Cycle 6) in the following European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQC30) scales (separately): physical function, role function, and GHS/QoL., Randomization to first deterioration maintained for two consecutive assessments, or one assessment followed by death from any cause wthin 3 weeks or 6 weeks (approximately 42 months)|Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events, Throughout study duration (approximately 42 months)|Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events for Combination Treatment, Adverse Events Related to Atezolizumab, and TKI-Related Adverse Events, Throughtout study (approximately 42 months)|Number of Participants With Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADAs) to Atezolizumab, Throughout study (approximately 42 months)|Serum Concentration of Atezolizumab, At pre-defined intervals from first administration of study drug to approximately 42 months
