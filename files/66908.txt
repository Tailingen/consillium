A Study of Pirtobrutinib (LOXO-305) Versus Ibrutinib in Participants With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL)
The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of pirtobruitinib (LOXO-305) to ibrutinib in participants with CLL/SLL. Participants may or may not have already had treatment for their cancer. Participation could last up to six years.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Leukemia, Lymphocytic|Leukemia, B-cell|Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma
DRUG: Pirtobrutinib|DRUG: Ibrutinib
Percentage of Participants Achieving Complete Response (CR), Complete Remission with Incomplete Hematologic Recovery (Cri), Nodular Partial Remission (nPR) or Partial Response (PR): Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR as assessed by independent review committee (IRC) per International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (iwCLL) 2018 criteria, Baseline to best overall response at or before the initiation of subsequent anti-cancer therapy (if any) (approximately 3 years and 5 months)
Event-Free Survival (EFS), EFS by IRC per iwCLL 2018 criteria, Randomization to first occurrence of treatment discontinuation due to adverse event/toxicity, treatment-emergent atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter of any grade, progressive disease (PD) or death (approximately 4 years)|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS by IRC per iwCLL 2018 criteria, Randomization to PD (per iwCLL 2018 criteria) or death from any cause (approximately 5 years 8 months)|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR, Time from the date of the first documented response of CR, CRi, nPR or PR to the earlier of documentation of definitive PD (per iwCLL 2018 criteria) or death from any cause (approximately 2 years)|Overall Survival (OS), OS, Randomization to death from any cause (approximately 6 years)|Time to Next Treatment (TTNT), TTNT, Randomization to initiation of the next systemic anticancer therapy for CLL/SLL or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (approximately 6 years)|Time to Worsening (TTW) of CLL/SLL Related Symptoms, Using symptom questions identified from the EORTC item library. The range of raw scores for these items could be from 0 to 52 with highest score being worse symptoms., Randomization to time to worsening symptoms (approximately 6 years)
The purpose of Part 1 of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of pirtobruitinib (LOXO-305) to ibrutinib in participants with CLL/SLL; participants may or may not have already had treatment for their cancer. The purpose of Part 2 of this study evaluates pirtobrutinib monotherapy in treatment-na√Øve participants with CLL/SLL with 17p deletions. Participation could last up to six years for Part 1. Participation could last up to 2 years for Part 2.
