Integrating a Health Information Technology System for Primary and Secondary Cervical Cancer Prevention
The project aims to increase HPV vaccination and cervical cancer screening through a web-based mobile health education program called, Wheel of Wellness (WoW) and a brief negotiated interview (BNI). The in-person BNI and WoW system will provide educational resources for participants and their families to learn more about HPV vaccination and cervical cancer screening.

BEHAVIORAL: WoW and BNI
HPV vaccine series start and completion, The primary outcome of interest is receipt of the first dose and completion of the three-dose or two-dose series of HPV vaccine by participants within six months of intervention by EMR review., 6 months
HPV and Cervical Cancer awareness and knowledge, Change in knowledge of HPV vaccination and cervical cancer will be measured using a survey, which is under development, that includes questions about HPV and HPV vaccination. It will be administered before and again after the intervention and changes in responses will be compared., 6-12 months|Provider-patient communication about HPV vaccine and cervical cancer, Based on participants' entries onto the WoW website, a list of their concerns and questions about HPV vaccine and cervical cancer will be created and this list will be brought to a clinical visit with their providers. Following the clinical visit, participants will be asked whether providers addressed their questions and concerns about HPV vaccine and cervical cancer using a short questionnaire with a 5 point likert scale where 1=completely addressed and 5= not at all addressed. Lower scores are favorable., one week after provider visit throughout the duration of the study|Wheel of Wellness (WoW) feasibility, The feasibility of WoW will be assessed by using a short questionnaire that measures both how easy the WoW site is to navigate and how frequently participants used the WoW site., 6 months|Wheel of Wellness (WoW) feasibility, The feasibility of WoW will be assessed by using a short questionnaire that measures both how easy the WoW site is to navigate and how frequently participants used the WoW site., 12 months
WoW will be tailored to the participant and will be based on the participant's cancer screening and HPV vaccine health needs; It will then send custom text messages based their concerns and will remind them to schedule and attend their doctor's appointment. The researchers will conduct a single armed proof of concept where the participants will be actively using WoW. The in-person BNI will empower participants to have positive behavioral changes in regards to their health by giving them appropriate health information as well as answering their questions and concerns about cervical cancer prevention and screening.
