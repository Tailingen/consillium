MRI Fusion Biopsy vs. Micro-Ultrasound Guided Biopsy
The purpose of this study is to find out how best to detect clinically significant lesions of prostate cancer by using micro-ultrasound technology (ExactVu) and by multiparametric magnetic-resonance imaging (mpMRI).
Prostate Cancer
PROCEDURE: Standard of Care Biopsy
Detection Rate, To compare the detection rates of clinically significant prostate cancer lesions by ExactVu micro-ultrasound and by MRI-fusion, 2 years|Feasibility of ExactVu, To determine the feasibility of using ExactVu micro-ultrasounds to screen for prostate cancer in socioeconomically disadvantaged populations with limited access to care. Feasibility is measured by the percentage of patients that successfully undergo the study procedures., 2 years
Predictive Performance Measures, To evaluate the sensitivity of ExactVu micro-ultrasound method and MRI-fusion method in detection of prostate cancer, 2 years|Predictive Performance Measures, To evaluate the negative predictive value of ExactVu micro-ultrasound method and MRI-fusion method in detection of prostate cancer, 2 years
This is a pilot clinical trial with 30 patients with either: 1) suspected prostate cancer (based on elevated PSA or abnormal digital rectal exam (DRE), or 2) known low-risk prostate cancer being managed with active surveillance.

Enrolled patients will undergo MRI fusion biopsy and standard-template 12 core TRUS biopsy as the standard-of-care. Patients will also undergo micro-ultrasound evaluation and targeted biopsy if lesions are identified. Detection rates of clinically significant lesions by ExactVu and by MRI will be compared.
