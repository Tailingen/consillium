ProofPrincip IntraTu TCells SinglDoseImmunCheckpoinInhib Gastro-Esophage Adenocarcinoma w/ARID1a Mu
This is a proof of principle clinical trial determining efficacy of single dose dualimmune checkpoint inhibitors to increase intra-tumoral T cells in esophageal, gastroesophageal junction, and gastric adenocarcinomas. These are subjects who have not previously been treated for their disease, who are willing to undergo biopsy procedures, who's disease has not spread to other parts of the body, who's tumors have ARID1A mutations.
