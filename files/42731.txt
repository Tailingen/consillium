Drug-Eluting Bead, Irinotecan (DEBIRI) Therapy of Liver Metastasis From Colon Cancer With Systemic Fluorouracil, Oxaliplatin, Leucovorin and Bevacizumab
This is a multicentre, open labeled, controlled phase study designed to assess effectiveness of chemoembolization with LC Beads, both with and without systemic chemotherapy, in the treatment of unresectable liver metastases in patients with colorectal cancer.
Colon Cancer With Metastases to the Liver
DEVICE: LC beads loaded with Irinotecan|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Leucovorin|DRUG: 5-Fluorouracil|DRUG: Bevacizumab
Tumor Response, Tumor response will be determined using Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST). Response will classified as: Complete response - disappearance of all lesions; Partial response - at least 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of longest diameter or 30% reduction of arterial enhancement; Progressive disease - at least 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest longest diameter recorded since start of treatment or appearance of one or more new lesions greater than 1cm in size; Stable disease - neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter since start of treatment., Months 2, 4 and 6
Number of Serious Adverse Events, Total number of serious adverse events that occurred in both Arms of the study., First treatment through one year post treatment completion
This is a multicentre, open labeled, prospective, randomized, controlled phase I/II study designed to assess the clinical performance of chemoembolization with Low Compression Bead (LC Bead), loaded with irinotecan in combination with intravenous chemotherapy and bevacizumab versus intravenous chemotherapy in combination with bevacizumab in the treatment of unresectable liver metastases in patients with colorectal cancer.
