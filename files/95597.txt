Phase 1 Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Anti-Tumor Activity of AB-201
This clinical trial will enroll subjects with HER2+ solid tumors and is conducted in two phases, which are phase 1a and phase 1b. The primary objective of phase 1 is to determine the safety and tolerability of AB-201 in subjects with advanced HER2+ solid tumors.

DRUG: AB-201|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Fludarabine
Incidence, severity, seriousness, and dose relationship of Adverse Events [Safety & Tolerability], Adverse events and laboratory abnormalities will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 5.0., up to 18 months per patient|Determination of Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D), Assessment of Dose-Limiting Toxicities(DLTs), pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and objective response rate (ORR) per the Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 in subjects with HER2+ breast cancer and gastric/GEJ cancer.

PK: Monitor persistence of AB-201 in subjects samples collected prior to and following AB-201 administration., up to 18 months per patient
To determine the preliminary efficacy, by the objective response rate (ORR) per the Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, of AB-201 in subjects with advanced HER2+ solid tumors, The proportion of subjects who experienced an PR or CR, as assessed by investigators per RECIST v1.1., up to 18 months per patient
This is a Phase 1, multicenter study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of AB-201 in subjects with advanced HER2+ solid tumors (specifically, breast and gastric/GEJ cancers).

The Phase 1 will be conducted in two parts, an initial dose escalation stage followed by a dose expansion stage.

Study participation for each subject begins with up to 28 days (1 month) of screening following written informed consent, then lymphodepletion treatment, followed by AB-201. Up to 3 doses of AB-201 may be administered. All subjects will be monitored for a total duration of 18 months of follow up from the first dose administration of AB-201.
