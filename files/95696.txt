TR64 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a open-label, dose escalation, accelerated titration combined 3+3 design, phase I study, to evaluate the safety and tolerability, and to determine the RP2D of TR64 when administered qd in patients with advanced solid tumors. Up to 6 cohorts of 1-6 or 3-6 patients each will be treated in the study.

Patients will receive study treatment until criteria for study termination are met. A Safety Follow-up Visit will be conducted 28 days (Â±7 days) after the last dose of study treatment. Patients who discontinue study treatment for reasons other disease progression will have post-treatment follow-up for disease assessment until start of new anticancer treatment, patient withdraws consent, is lost to follow-up, death, or until the Sponsor stops the study, whichever comes first.

Adverse events will be assessed using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) Version 5.0.

Tumor response will be assessed by computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan using RECIST 1.1 criteria, assessed by the investigator.
