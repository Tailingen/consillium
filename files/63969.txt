Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Preliminary Efficacy of BYON4413 in Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Myelodysplastic Neoplasms.
This is the first-in-human trial with BYON4413 to evaluate safety, PK, immunogenicity, and anti-leukemia activity of BYON4413 in patients with AML or MDS.

This trial includes two parts. Part 1 is a dose escalation study in which the maximum tolerated dose and recommended dose for expansion of BYON4413 will be determined. Part 2 is an expansion study to evaluate the anti-leukemia activity and safety of BYON4413.
