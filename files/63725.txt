Study of Pembrolizumab With Lanreotide Depot for Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors
This study is for patients with non-resectable, recurrent, or metastatic well or moderately differentiated gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs).

The study will be conducted in two stages: 1) Safety Run-In and 2) Expanded Cohort.

1. Safety run-in: The first stage will include a safety run-in of 6 patients treated with pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenous (IV) every 3 weeks and lanreotide depot 90mg subcutaneous (SQ) every 3 weeks. Up to 6 patients at the Duke Cancer Institute will be accrued at the starting dose level. If one or less subject meets treatment-related discontinuation criteria (as specified in the protocol) during Cycle 1, then the study will proceed to the second stage, Expanded Cohort.
2. Expanded Cohort: Patients will be treated with pembrolizumab 200mg IV every 3 weeks and lanreotide depot 90mg SQ every 3 weeks as determined by the Safety Run-In Cohort.
Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors
DRUG: Lanreotide|DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Objective Response Rate (ORR) as Measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), ORR is calculated as the number of people with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), divided by the total number of people treated. Complete response is defined as disappearance of all target lesions. Partial response is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. A lower limit of the true ORR will be estimated by the 90% exact lower confidence bound (LCB) for the binomial proportion. A 90% LCB of \< 0.1 will be considered not to be of clinical value. If the 90% LCB is ≥ 0.1, the regimen will be considered efficacious., Approximately every 12 weeks until study completion (up to 2 years)
Number of Participants Experiencing Treatment-related AEs Leading to Drug Discontinuations During the First 12 Weeks of Treatment, Adverse events were graded using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0., First 12 weeks of treatment|Months of Progression-free Survival (PFS), Months from treatment start date until the date of first documented radiographic progression or date of death from any cause (whichever is first); assessed up to 48 weeks after the last subject has finished study drug regimen. Progression is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression., Up to 3 years|Months of Overall Survival (OS), Months from treatment start date until the date of death from any cause; assessed up to 48 weeks after the last subject has finished the study drug regimen, Up to 59 months|ORR as Measured by Immune-related Response Criteria (irRC), Treatment response as assessed by irRC instead of RECIST v1.1. ORR is calculated as the number of people with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), divided by the total number of people treated. Complete response is defined as complete disappearance of all lesions (whether measurable or not, and no new lesions), confirmed by a repeat, consecutive assessment no less than 4 weeks from the date first documented. Partial response is defined as a decrease in tumor burden ≥ 50% relative to baseline, confirmed by a consecutive assessment at least 4 weeks after first documentation. A lower limit of the true ORR will be estimated by the 90% exact lower confidence bound (LCB) for the binomial proportion., Approximately every 12 weeks until study completion (up to 2 years)
