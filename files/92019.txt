Sertraline in Treatment of Low-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome
This study will investigate the effects of sertraline in people with low-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). It is hoped that sertraline will decrease disease progression and reduce the need for blood transfusions.

This pilot study investigates clinical benefit of four 28-day cycles of sertraline in low-risk MDS patients. Participants will receive 100mg of oral sertraline daily. The study will also evaluate potential associated biological mechanisms of action.
