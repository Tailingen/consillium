Safety and Tolerability Clinical Trial of Different Doses of the Immunotherapeutic Drug Mobilan (M-VM3) and Placebo in Patients With Prostate Cancer
Phase I single-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single injections of ascending doses of investigational drug product Mobilan (лю-VM3) administered directly into the prostate of patients with prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Mobilan (M-VM3)|DRUG: Placebo
Frequency and intensity of adverse events (according to CTCAE v 4.03 classification), Baseline to up to 29 days after the drug administration
Exposure of Mobilan DNA vector in patient's peripheral blood, Using validated PCR assay, Baseline to up to 29 days after the drug administration|Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measure, Baseline PSA level will be taken from medical history, On Day 29 after the drug administration|Immune cell count in whole blood of patients assessed with flow cytometry, Including leucocytes, lymphocytes, T-lymphocyte, leukocyte index, total T-lymphocytes, CD3, T-helper cells CD3 + CD4 +, T-cytotoxic CD3 + CD8 +, regulation index (CD4 / CD8), double-cells CD4 + / CD8 +, NK cells CD3-CD (16 + 56) +, TNK-cells CD3 + CD (16 +56) +, B-lymphocytes CD19 +, 0-lymphocytes, Baseline to up to 29 days after the drug administration|Histopathological assessment of prostate tissue using Gleason grading system (if prostatectomy is made in the study period, and material is available for analysis), The Gleason grading system is used to evaluate the stage of prostate cancer using samples from biopsy or post-surgical samples as follow:

1 - The cancerous prostate closely resembles normal prostate tissue. 2 - The tissue still has well-formed glands, but they are larger and have more tissue between them. 3 - The tissue still has recognizable glands, but the cells are darker. 4 - The tissue has few recognizable glands. 5 - The tissue does not have any or only a few recognizable glands., On Day 29 after the drug administration|Presence of protein 502s in blood plasma, Using ELISA assay, Baseline to up to 29 days after the drug administration|Titer of 502 antibodies (AB) in peripheral blood serum, Using ELISA assay, Baseline to up to 29 days after the drug administration|Histopathological assessment of prostate tissue using Irani scale (if prostatectomy is made in the study period, and material is available for analysis), Irani J (1997) scale include histological assessment of slide mounts obtained after operation as follow:

Degree of immune cell infiltration:

0 - No inflammatory cells, 1 - Scattered inflammatory cell infiltrate within the stroma without lymphoid nodules, 2 - Nonconfluent lymphoid nodules, 3 - Large inflammatory areas with confluence of infiltrate, On Day 29 after the drug administration
Mobilan is a type V adenovirus carrying TLR5 receptor and its agonist, protein 502s. It's mechanism of action involves activation of immune system and extensive mobilisation of various immunocytes to administration locus. It's safety and tolerability is currently evaluated in first-in-man phase I study in prostate cancer patients. Treatment strategy for the disease (radical prostatectomy or active observation) will be determined by the Investigator in accordance with routine clinical practice of the hospital.

Patients will be randomised in cohorts of 4 subjects, where 3 subjects will be administered with Mobilan (лю-VM3), and one patient will be administered with placebo.

The dose will be escalated from cohort to cohort, the decision on possible dose escalation will be made by Independent Safety Review Board.
