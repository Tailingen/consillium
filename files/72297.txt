Study in Patients With Untreated Multiple Myeloma and Renal Insufficiency
The study will evaluate the effects of BHQ880 in patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma and renal insufficiency who are not considered candidates for bisphosphonate therapy. The primary objective of the study will be to evaluate the effect of BHQ880 in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone, compared to placebo administered with the combination on the time to first Skeletal Related Event (SRE) on study.
