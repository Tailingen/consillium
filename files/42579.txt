STA-9090 in Previously Treated Patients With Advanced Esophagogastric Cancer
In this research study, the investigators are looking to see how effective STA-9090 is in treating esophagogastric cancer. The investigators will also evaluate the side effects of STA-9090, and examine the relationship between the presence of HSP-90 and how well study participants respond to STA-9090. STA-9090 works by blocking a protein in tumor cells called HSP90, which is thought to play a role in tumor growth. By interfering with this protein's function, STA-9090 may help kill tumor cells. This drug has been used in other research studies and information from those other research studies suggests that this agent may help to slow tumor growth in esophagogastric cancer.
Esophagogastric Cancer
DRUG: STA-9090
To evaluate the efficacy of STA-9090 in patients who have progressed through prior 1st-line treatment for esophagogastric cancer, as measured by overall response rate., 2 years
To determine progression-free survival., 3 years|To retrospectively determine the prevalence of HSP-90 clients in the tumors of subjects treated on trial., 2 years|To correlate the presence of HSP-clients with response rate and progression-free survival, 3 years|To determine safety, tolerability and adverse event profiles of this therapeutic regimen in the treatment of esophagogastric cancer., 2 years
* Each treatment cycle lasts 4 weeks during which time the study drug will be administered for three consecutive weeks followed by 1 week of no study drug. STA-9090 will be given by intravenous infusion.
* Participants will come to the clinic on Days 1, 8, and 15 of all cycles. At these visits, the following tests and procedures will be performed: Review of current medications and any side effects experienced; Performance status evaluation; Physical examination; Vital signs; Routine blood tests; CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (every 2 cycles) and Optional FDG-PET scan (every 2 cycles).
* Participants may remain on this research study for as long as their cancer is responding to the study drug and they are not experiencing any severe side effects.
