Gemcitabine/Taxotere/Xeloda (GTX) With Cisplatin in Subjects With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
Primary Objectives

To assess the efficacy of the combination of gemcitabine, taxotere, and xeloda (GTX) with cisplatin in subjects with metastatic pancreatic cancer based on the progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 6 month.

Secondary Objectives

* To assess safety and characterize toxicities of the combination of GTX with cisplatin in subjects with metastatic pancreatic cancer.
* To estimate disease control rate (DCR), PFS, and overall survival (OS).
* To estimate a PFS rate of an expansion cohort testing an alternative schedule.

Study Design

This study is a single arm phase II study to assess the efficacy of GTX with cisplatin in subjects with metastatic pancreatic cancer. Approximately 38 evaluable subjects will be enrolled, 28 in the initial cohort and 10 in the expansion cohort

The study will have a safety run-in phase consisting of 6 subjects. To ensure that the combination is safe, the first six subjects will be treated at DL1 and observed for limiting toxicity for the first 2 cycles before continuation with further accrual. After the safety run-in, the study will be continuously monitored for adverse events.

The primary endpoint will be the PFS rate at 6 month, which is defined as the proportion of subjects alive, free of disease progression at 6 months. The treatment regimen would be considered of insufficient activity for further study in this population if PFS rate at 6 months is 50% or less, and the minimum required level of efficacy that would warrant further study with the proposed regimen is a 75% PFS rate at 6 months. The study design includes interim monitoring for futility using a predictive probability approach. We will stop the study early if given the information at the interim analysis, it is unlikely that the PFS rate at 6 months will be greater than 50% if the study continues to the end.
Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Taxotere|DRUG: Xeloda|DRUG: Cisplatin
Percentage of Participants Without Disease Progression (Progression-Free Survival) at 6 Months, PFS is defined as the percentage of patients with disease progression (progressive disease \[PD\] or relapse from complete response \[CR\] as assessed using RECIST 1.1 criteria) or death due to any cause at 6 months. Per RECIST 1.1 criteria, CR = disappearance of all target lesions, Partial Response (PR) is =\>30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, Progressive Disease (PD) is \>20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, Stable Disease (SD) is \<30% decrease or \<20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions. Estimation based on the Kaplan-Meier curve., 6 months
Number of Patients Experiencing a Grade 3 or Above Treatment-related Toxicity, When calculating the incidence of AEs, each AE (as defined by NCI CTCAE v4.03) will be counted only once for a given subject. AEs collected from time of first dose of study drug through 28 days after the last dose of study drug. The median duration of treatment was up to 23 months., Up to 23 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of patients achieving a complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1). CR = disappearance of all target lesions, PR is =\>30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, progressive disease (PD) is \>20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, stable disease (SD) is \<30% decrease or \<20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions., Up to 22 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the the number of months from the date of first dose to disease progression (progressive disease \[PD\] or relapse from complete response \[CR\] as assessed using RECIST 1.1 criteria) or death due to any cause . Per RECIST 1.1 criteria, CR = disappearance of all target lesions, Partial Response (PR) is =\>30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, Progressive Disease (PD) is \>20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, Stable Disease (SD) is \<30% decrease or \<20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions. Estimation based on the Kaplan-Meier curve., Up to 21 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS (in months) will be measured from date of first dose until death (OS will be censored on the date the subject was last known to be alive for subjects without documentation of death at the time of analysis). Estimation based on the Kaplan-Meier curve., Up to 28 months
