Prevalence of a Localized or Diffuse Pruritus in a Population With One or Several, Primitive or Secondary, Brain Tumor(s)
The association between the presence of pruritus, especially centrofacial, and the presence of a brain tumor is a widespread notion in the medical community but based on a single publication by Andreev et al. in the British Journal of Dermatology published in 1975. No other study has studied this association with a rigorous methodology. The aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of pruritus in patients with one or more primary or secondary brain tumor(s), benign(s) or malignant(s).
