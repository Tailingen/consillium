Treatment Response Adapted Hybrid Radiotherapy in Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Receiving First-line Immunotherapy
This study is a multicenter, randomized controlled clinical trial to explore the preliminary efficacy and safety of treatment response adapted hybrid radiotherapy (LDRT and SBRT) in the first-line treatment of immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy for advanced driver-gene negative NSCLC, and to provide new ideas for the comprehensive treatment of advanced NSCLC
NSCLC Stage IV
RADIATION: SBRT or LDRT|DRUG: PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor combined with platinum-based chemotherapy
Progression Free Survival, The time from enrollment to disease progression or death from any cause. Patients who were still alive at the time of analysis will have the date of their last contact as the cutoff date., Two years
Overall Survival, The time from enrollment to death from any cause. Patients who were still alive at the time of analysis will have the date of their last contact as the cutoff date., Two years|Objective response rate, According to RECISIT1.1 criteria, the proportion of patients achieving CR and PR as their best response before initial disease progression was evaluated., Two years|Progression free survival 2, The time between enrollment and the observation of second disease progression or the occurrence of death from any cause. Patients who were still alive at the time of analysis will have the date of their last contact as the cutoff date., Two years|Treatment-related adverse event, Investigator-assessed treatment-related adverse events were recorded and assessed according to CTCAE5.0, Two years
