Age and Gender Corrected Body Mass Index
Esophagectomy for cancer is often accompanied with severe preoperative weight loss. Body Mass Index (BMI) values are age-independent and the same for both sexes. From the perspective that these two parameters should actually be taken into account too, we developed a model to calculate "age-gender specific BMI-percentiles" (AG-BMI) and tested this model in relation to survival outcome after esophagectomy for cancer.
Esophageal Cancer
Overall 5 year survival, Overall 5-year survival after esophagectomy for cancer, 5 years after esophagectomy
Age-Gender specific BMI percentiles are more accurate compared to the current BMI classes in predicting Overall Survival (OS) after esophagectomy for cancer. Furthermore we believe in a more devastating impact on OS from underweight and not from overweight.

By preoperatively identifying risk patients for poorer OS, especially the non-tumoral deaths, this can be a tool to tailor postoperative nutritional strategies to counter further weight loss and bringing postoperative weight to normal ranges.
