Epilepsy-related Brain Tumors Register
Epilepsy is defined by a cerebral disorder characterized by a lasting predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by the neurobiological, cognitive, psychological and social consequences of this affection. The definition of epilepsy requires the occurrence of at least one epileptic seizure. 1% of the population suffers from epilepsy. The most common causes are genetic and vascular, 10% of epileptic syndromes are caused by a tumor.

The incidence of brain tumors in people with epilepsy is approximately 4%. Among patients with brain tumor (s), the frequency of epilepsy is 30% or more depending on type of tumeur. 30-50% of brain tumors are revealed by an epileptic seizure and 10 to 30% of patients with brain tumor (s) will develop seizures during their evolution.

The main objective is to evaluate the frequency of epileptic seizures according to the type of brain tumor.
