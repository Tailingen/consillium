Phase II Study of AZD2281 in Patients With Known BRCA Mutation Status or Recurrent High Grade Ovarian Cancer or Patients With Known BRCA Mutation Status/ Triple Neg Breast Cancer
This is a Phase II, open label, non randomized correlative study of AZD2281 in patients with recurrent breast and ovarian cancer in both BRCA inherited mutation carriers and non-carriers to identify objective response rate and to assess for early markers of activity and to assess correlative markers that may provide helpful information for subsequent clinical trials. Approximately 110 patients from 7 centers in Canada will be enrolled into this study
Ovarian Carcinoma|Breast Cancer
DRUG: AZD2281
Objective Response Rate (ORR) Evaluated According to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) Guidelines, Percentage of participants with confirmed best RECIST response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). Patients with a best RECIST response of CR or PR had to have a confirmed response at least 28 days later., Each patient with measurable disease at baseline was assessed for Objective Response from the sequence of RECIST scan data up to data cut-off, 26 March 2010. RECIST scans were performed every 8 weeks (+/- 2 weeks) from randomization.
Disease Control Rate (DCR), Percentage of participants with confirmed best Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST) response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR) orStable Disease (SD), 16 Weeks|Duration of Response, Duration of response is measured from the time the measurement criteria for CR or PR are met (whichever is first recorded) until the patient progresses (per RECIST criteria). If patient did not progress, they are censored at their last objective tumour assessment date., RECIST tumour assessments carried out every 8 weeks from randomization (+/- 2 weeks) until data cut-off on 26 March 2010.|Best Percentage Change From Baseline in Tumour Size, The best percentage change (reduction) from baseline in tumour size (defined as the sum of the longest diameters as measured among all target lesions)., Each patient with measurable disease at baseline was assessed for best percentage change in tumour size from the sequence of RECIST scan data up to data cut-off, 26 March 2010. RECIST scans were performed every 8 weeks (+/- 2 weeks) from randomization.|CA-125 Levels (Ovarian Cancer Patients Only), A response according to CA-125 has occurred if there is at least a 50% reduction in CA-125 levels from a pre-treatment sample., 24 weeks|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from first dose to the earlier date of radiologic progression (as per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST) criteria or death by any cause in the absence of objective progression., RECIST tumour assessments carried out every 8 weeks from randomization (+/- 2 weeks) until data cut-off on 26 March 2010.
