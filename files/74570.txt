Feasibility Study of Sentinel Navigation Surgery After Non-curative Endoscopic Resection
Purpose: To prove the feasibility of sentinel node navigation surgery (SNNS) in early gastric cancer patients with the risk of lymph node metastasis after endoscopic resection and preparation of multicenter phase 3 trial of stomach preserving surgery in these patients.

Contents: The number of enrollment is 247 patients. The patients underwent endoscopic resection for early gastric cancer, and the tumor was defined to be out of indication for endoscopic resection pathologically. So, additional gastrectomy is recommended for them.

The investigators will enroll patients who agree this study. After general anesthesia, Tc99m-Phytate with indocyanine green will be injected with endoscopy. Then sentinel basin will be detected using gamma probe and laparoscopic basin dissection will be done. Sentinel lymph node will be identify in back table dissection, and patients will undergo conventional gastrectomy. Detection rate and false negative rate will be evaluated by pathological review.
Sentinel Lymph Node|Early Gastric Cancer
PROCEDURE: Sentinel basin dissection
detection rate (%), number of patients whose sentinel nodes are detected / enrolled number of patients \*100, 15 days after operation
False negative rate, number of patients without metastatic lymph node in sentinel basin / number of patients with metastatic lymph node \*100, 15 days after operation
Sentinel basin dissection method

1. endoscopic tracer injection after general anesthesia
2. Tracer : Tc99m-phytate 3cc and indocyanine green 3cc mix --\> Injection of the probe (1cc/site, 4 sites) around endoscopic submucosal dissection ulcer scar
3. Sentinel basin identification with laparoscopic probe
4. Dissection of the sentinel basin
5. Sentinel node dissection at back table
6. Conventional laparoscopic gastrectomy
