Effects of BIS Closed Loop Target Controlled Infusion on Perioperative Inflammatory Response and Prognosis of Elderly Patients Undergoing Laparoscopic Radical Gastrectomy for Gastric Cancer
The purpose of this study is to find the elderly patients with laparoscopic gastric cancer radical is suitable the BIS closed round target control level of anesthesia depth of sedation, can decrease the elderly laparoscopic gastric cancer radical surgery in patients with perioperative inflammatory reaction, and reduce the incidence of perioperative pulmonary complications such as, for elderly patients with gastric cancer radical perioperative inflammation control to provide the reference and provide guidance for clinical anesthesia work.
The Effect of BIS Closed-loop Target Control on Postoperative Operation
DEVICE: BIS closed-loop target controlled infusion
Postoperative complications, pulmonary infection, oxygenation injury, arrhythmia, bleeding, intestinal paralysis, incision infection, renal insufficiency, cognitive dysfunction, etc., Within one week after surgery|mortality rate, mortality rate, Within 30 days after surgery|Serum LEVELS of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-ɑ, IFN-γ, Serum levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-ɑ and IFN-γ were determined immediately before operation, 2 hours after operation, 24 hours after operation and 72 hours after operation, Within three days of the surgery
In this study, elderly patients undergoing laparoscopic radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer were randomly divided into BIS closed circle target controlled infusion (BIS) 55 group and 45 group, and the levels of perioperative inflammatory response indicators IL-6, TNF-α and IL-10 at different depths of anesthesia and sedation were recorded. The duration of stay in anesthesia recovery room, quality of recovery, postoperative pain and postoperative pulmonary complications were observed. Objective To evaluate the feasibility of BIS closed loop target controlled infusion in elderly patients undergoing laparoscopic radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer.

Perioperative period is a process of intense stress response, which is mainly manifested by the production and aggregation of inflammatory factors, which adversely affect multiple organs such as brain, heart and lung, and is an important risk factor for increasing postoperative complications and postoperative mortality .

Perioperative inflammatory response status has a clear relationship with postoperative recovery of patients, and perioperative anesthesia and sedation depth management and precision anesthesia is one of the most critical links to control the stress response, and appropriate anesthesia and sedation depth control and stress regulation can significantly improve the prognosis of patients . How to reduce the adverse effects of perioperative stress response on patients has been the focus of research and attention in recent years.
