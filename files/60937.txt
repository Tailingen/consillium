Real-world Study of Serplulimab in 2L and Above Treatment of Cervical Cancer
This study is a Prospective, Multicenter, non-interventive Real-world Study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the treatment of Serplulimab in patients with Advanced,Recurrent and Metastatic Cervical Cancer. Approximately 118 eligible subjects are planned to be enrolled across all sites.
Cervical Cancer
DRUG: Serplulimab
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective Response Rate is defined as the percentage of patients with Complete Response or Partial Response, as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v.1.1 criteria or immune Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v.1.1 criteria by investigators., Up to approximately 24 months
Progression free survival (PFS), Progression free survival is defined as the time from the first day of serplulimab administration to progression disease or deathï¼Œwhichever occurs first, by the investigator according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v.1.1 criteria or immune Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v.1.1 criteria., Up to approximately 24 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS, defined as the time from initiation of study treatment to death from any cause. To assess clinical effectiveness of any serplulimab single used or combined therapy involved in this study by assessment of overall survival (OS) in patients with cervical Cancer. Time intervals for tumor assessment is every 6 or 12 week ., Baseline up to approximately 36 months|Duration of response (DOR), Duration of response is defined as the duration from the first documentation of objective response to the first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 24 months|Time to the first disease progression, Ddefined as the interval between the date of the initial medication and the time of imaging progression., Up to approximately 24 months|1-year and 2-year Progression free survival Rate, PFS is defined as the time from first administration to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. PFS Rate was defined as the percentage of participants that are PFS event-free over 1-year and 2-year., Baseline up to approximately 24 months|1-year and 2-year Overall Survival Rate, OS, defined as the time from initiation of study treatment to death from any cause. OS Rate was defined as the percentage of participants that are OS event-free over 1-year and 2-year., Baseline up to approximately 24 months|1-year and 2-year Disease Control Rate, Percentage of all evaluable Participants Achieving Complete Response (CR) and Partial Response (PR) and Stable Disease (SD) from first administration to 1-year and 2-year., Baseline up to approximately 24 months
