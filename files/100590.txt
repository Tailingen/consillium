Additive Homeopathy in Cancer Patients
The investigators aim to investigate the validity of their previous results in a randomized prospective, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter controlled evaluation of questionnaires in patients with advanced malignant tumors. The investigators plan to compare the treatment outcome (quality of life and survival) in tumor patients, receiving standard or "add-on" homeopathic treatment.

The null hypothesis is that "add-on" homeopathic treatment does not create a benefit for cancer patients. In addition the investigators evaluate survival time.

EORTC-QLQ-C30 Score, Quality of life was evaluated by using the Global Health Status assessed by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC-QLQ-C30), which was completed by participants throughout the study.

The score of the scale ranges from 0-100, where high values mean good health status, while lower values indicate poor health status., baseline and at 18 weeks
Survival, Survival was assessed by chart review, at every study visit (every 9 weeks throughout the trial), and by information of the central mortality registry of Austria, 2 years for the individual patient (=whole study duration)
The EORTC-QLQ-C30, SF-36 as well as a VAS scale for subjective well-being will be filled out by the patients.
