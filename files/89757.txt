Observational Study of Patients Older Than 60 Years With Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia
The main objective of this observational survey is to estimate the incidence, the typology, and the evolution of patients with acute myelobalstic leukemia, aged more than 60 years old. In this age group (aged more than 60y), three groups of patients with very different response rates and late outcome can be delineated with specific standard chemotherapy.

cumulative incidence of failures, failures include

* resistant disease defined according to the IWG AML response criteria
* hypoplastic marrow after D42 and absence of myeloidrecovery
* early relapse up to 9 months from CR : Either AML relapse as in the IWG classification or MDS relapse, 9 months
response rate, 9 months|relapse rate, Either AML relapse as in the IWG classification

- Or MDS relapse defined for this study as follows: (i) Persistent cytopenias, if unexplained by other cause, and (ii) myelodysplastic marrow with less than 20% marrow blasts in two samples taken 3 months apart, within 2 years after inclusion|overall survival, within 2 years after inclusion|adverse events, within 2 years after inclusion
