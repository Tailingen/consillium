Cohort of Non-small Cell Lung Cancer With Mutation of the Nord Pas de Calais (CB(NPC)Â²)
The investigators propose to create a database at the regional level, the principle is to include all patients in whom a mutation was detected from a single platform (Lille). The creation of this regional cohort, smaller than the national cohort of Biomarkers France, will perform a more comprehensive collection of clinical data, and molecular monitoring data of patients included. To increase the completeness of the collection of information, it will not be based on voluntary prescribing clinician but will be largely carried out by CRA dedicated to this activity.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
Correlation between clinical factors and mutation status, The clinical factors are age, smoking status, occupational and environmental exposure, personal and family background, TNM stage, performance status, at baseline
Progression-free survival, 3 years|Overall survival, 3 years|Number of patients included in a clinical trial dedicated to a certain type of non-small cell lung cancer with mutation, 3 years|Number of cases per mutation type, 3 years
This is a prospective and retrospective study of a population of patients with mutated non-small cell lung cancer in the Nord Pas de Calais. Retrospective cohort will involve patients with main molecular abnormalities, identifiable from molecular biology platform CRRC, except EGFR and KRAS treated from September 2011 to February 2013.
