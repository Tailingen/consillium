Study of FluBHPVE6E7 in HPV-16 Infected Women
BS-01 is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 dose escalation study assessing safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of FluBHPVE6E7, changes in the HPV infection status and cervical cytology, and biodistribution in HPV-16 infected women with normal cytology, CIN1 or CIN2. The safety and immunogenicity of two dose levels, 7.5 log10 and 9.0 log10 fTCID50/dose of FluBHPVE6E7 are assessed after three subcutaneous administrations. In addition the safety of 9.0 log10 fTCID50/dose of FluBHPVE6E7 is assessed after three intradermal or intramuscular administrations.

BS-01 is a randomised, placebo-controlled, double- blind phase 1 dose-escalation study in women with normal cytology, CIN1 or CIN2.

The primary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of FluBHPVE6E7. Secondary objectives are the assessment of the systemic immune responses to immunisations with FluBHPVE6E7, changes in HPV infection status and cervical cytology, and biodistribution.

Study medication is administered three times (Day 0, Week 4, Week 12). Study participants are randomised at a ratio of 3:1 for FluBHPVE6E7 or placebo. The first cohort is treated subcutaneously at dose level 7.5 log10 fTCID50/dose. The second cohort is treated subcutaneously at 9.0 log10 fTCID50/dose.

Interim safety reviews are performed by a Data Monitoring Committee. After completion of the dose-escalation and in order to collect additional safety data on the highest safe and tolerated dose level, additional study participants are enrolled into expansion cohorts treated three times subcutaneously, intradermally or intramuscularly at 9.0 log10 fTCID50/dose.
