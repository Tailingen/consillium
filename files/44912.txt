Phase I Study of TH1 Dendritic Cell Immunotherapy for the Treatment of Cutaneous Angiosarcoma
To find the highest tolerable dose of an mRNA vaccine that can be safely given to patients with cutaneous angiosarcoma
Angiosarcoma
DRUG: Paclitaxel|BIOLOGICAL: mRNA plus Lysate-loaded Dendritic Cell Vaccine|DRUG: PEGYLATED-INTERFERON ALPHA-2A|DRUG: Filgrastim
Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, through study completion; an average of 1 year
Objectives:

Primary objective:

•To determine the safety, toxicity, and feasibility of delivering autologous dendritic cells (DCs) loaded with tumor lysate plus mRNA to patients with cutaneous head \& neck angiosarcoma as adjuvant therapy.

Secondary objective:

• To assess the recurrence free survival and overall survival in treated patients in order to make initial assessment of activity of this therapeutic approach

Exploratory Objectives:

• To quantitate immune responses in patients who receive autologous DCs loaded with tumor lysate plus mRNA
