Postoperative Analgesia Impact of Narcotic Free Anesthesia
The first hypothesis of the study is that substituting fentanyl by esmolol and metoprolol during general anesthesia for patients undergoing mastectomy will result in less pain and less narcotic consumption in the recovery room. The investigators will also verify the impact of that substitution on nausea and vomiting, on the time spent in the recovery room and on chronic postsurgical pain (3 and 6 months).

Finally, the investigators will see the impact on breast cancer recurrence 5 years after the surgery.
