A Study to Assess the Clinical Efficacy and Safety of Daratumumab in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Natural Killer/T-Cell Lymphoma (NKTCL), Nasal Type
The purpose of this study is to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of daratumumab in relapsed or refractory natural killer/T-cell lymphomas (NKTCL).
Lymphoma
DRUG: Daratumumab
Percentage of Participants With Overall Response, Overall response was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per Revised Criteria for Response Assessment of Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma: LUGANO classification based on blinded independent central review (BICR). As per Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma, Lymph node measurements were taken from Computed Tomography (CT), CT portion of the Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT), where applicable. CR: complete disappearance of all evidence of disease; PR as a greater than (\>) 50 percent (%) decrease in the sum of the products of the maximal perpendicular diameters of measured lesions (SPD) and no new sites., Up to 2 years and 11 months
Percentage of Participants With Complete Response (CR), CR was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved CR as per Revised Criteria for Response Assessment of Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma: LUGANO classification based on BICR. CR was a complete disappearance of all evidence of disease., Up to 2 years and 11 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the duration from the date of the first daratumumab dose to the date of progression/relapse or death, whichever came first. Progressive disease (PD) was defined as any new lesion greater than (\>) 1.5 centimeter (cm) in any axis or greater than or equal to (\>=) 50 percent (%) increase in previously involved sites., Up to 2 years and 11 months|Duration of Response (DoR), DoR was defined as duration from the date of the initial documentation of a response to the date of first documented evidence of progressive disease (PD) (or relapse for participants who experienced CR). PD was defined as any new lesion \>1.5 cm in any axis or \>= 50% increase in previously involved sites., Up to 2 years and 11 months|Time to Response, Time to response was defined as the duration from the date of the first dose of daratumumab to the earliest date that a response (CR/PR based on BICR) is first documented. CR was defined as complete disappearance of all evidence of disease; PR as a greater than (\>) 50 percent (%) decrease in the sum of the products of the maximal perpendicular diameters of measured lesions (SPD) and no new sites., Up to 2 years and 11 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the duration from the date of the first daratumumab dose to the date of death., Up to 2 years and 11 months|Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical event that occurs in a participant administered an investigational product, and it does not necessarily indicate only events with clear causal relationship with the relevant investigational product. TEAE were defined as AEs with onset during the treatment period or that are a consequence of a pre-existing condition that has worsened since baseline., Up to 2 years and 11 months|Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Change in Vital Signs, Number of participants with clinically significant change in vital signs (blood pressure, temperature, pulse rate, and weight) was reported., Up to 2 years and 11 months|Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Electrocardiogram (ECG) Abnormalities, Number of participants with clinically significant ECG abnormalities were reported., Up to 2 years and 11 months|Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Change in Physical Finding, Number of participants with clinically significant change in physical finding was reported., Up to 2 years and 11 months|Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Change in Laboratory Parameters, Number of participants with clinically significant change in hematology (WBC, hemoglobin, platelets, neutrophils, and lymphocytes) and biochemistry (alanine transaminase \[ALT\], aspartate transaminase \[AST\], sodium, potassium, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, calcium laboratory parameters were reported., Up to 2 years and 11 months
