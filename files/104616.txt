Prostate Cancer Screening Trial Using Imaging
Participants will be recruited from the community and attend a screening clinic and undergo the following screening tests:

1. Bi-parametric MRI - reported by a radiologist and CAD-AI system
2. Multiparametric ultrasound - including shearwave elastography
3. A standard-of-care PSA test

A systematic +/- targeted biopsy will be performed if any tests are positive, independent of the other tests.
