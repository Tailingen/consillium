Pfizer PF-06688992 in Patients With Stage III or Stage IV Melanoma
The purpose of this research study is to learn about the safety and effectiveness of the study drug, PF-06688992. Before this study, PF-06688992 has never been given to people.

PF-06688992 is a targeted therapy for people with cancer. The investigators linked a chemotherapy drug to an antibody (protein found in the blood). The antibody will connect to GD3 which is found on most melanomas but on very few other cells in the body. The investigators hope that in this way, it will deliver this chemotherapy directly to the melanoma and not to normal tissues.
