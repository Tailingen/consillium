EORTC-QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire developed to assess the quality of life of cancer patients. Subject's responses to 28 questions about their physical functioning, disease symptoms, global health status and utilities are scored on a 4-point scale (1=Not at all to 4=Very much), a low score indicates a high / healthy level of functioning. And the responses to 2 questions about health-related QoL are scored on a 7-point scale (1=Very poor to 7=Excellent), a high score indicates a high / healthy level of functioning.

Using linear transformation, raw scores are standardized, so that scores range from 0 to 100., Baseline, every 4 weeks until week 52, every 8 weeks after week 52 up to end of treatment or end of post-treatment follow-up, approximately 3.5 years.|Pharmacokinetics (PK): Cmax, Full PK profile of eltrombopag over 24 hours at steady state at the initial dose, and at 125 mg and 150 mg when applicable, in subset of participants., Intensive: pre-dose, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours post-dose. Trough: 15th days after starting the initial dose or each dose modification until reaching the maximum dose.|PK: Tmax, Full PK profile of eltrombopag over 24 hours at steady state at the initial dose, and at 125 mg and 150 mg when applicable, in subset of participants., Intensive: pre-dose, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours post-dose. Trough: 15th days after starting the initial dose or each dose modification until reaching the maximum dose.|PK: AUC, Full PK profile of eltrombopag over 24 hours at steady state at the initial dose, and at 125 mg and 150 mg when applicable, in subset of participants., Intensive: pre-dose, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours post-dose. Trough: 15th days after starting the initial dose or each dose modification until reaching the maximum dose.|Trough concentrations of eltrombopag at steady state, at each dose level in all the participants, Intensive: pre-dose, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours post-dose. Trough: 15th days after starting the initial dose or each dose modification until reaching the maximum dose.
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Japanese local phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of eltrombopag monotherapy in Japanese adult patients with platelet transfusion-dependent lower-risk MDS (IPSS-R very low, low, intermediate risk with bone marrow blast count \< 5% and cytogenetic very good, good or intermediate risk). Platelet transfusion dependence at baseline is defined as receiving platelet transfusion regularly with a frequency of 2 or more times within 4 weeks prior to randomization. Platelet transfusion should be performed for a patient with platelet counts \< 20 X 10\^9/L, or with hemorrhagic symptoms and platelet counts \< 30 X 10\^9/L.

The primary objective is to demonstrate superiority of eltrombopag versus placebo in terms of the proportion of participants who achieve platelet transfusion independence at Week 24.
