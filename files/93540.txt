Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Surgical Treatment of Villo-nodular Synovitis of the Hip in Children
Villo-nodular synovitis can affect the joints, bursae or tendon sheaths. This condition is rare, with 1.8 cases per million inhabitants. The hip is affected in 3.6 to 18.1% of cases. The age of predilection is between 30 and 50 years old and this condition is rarely described in children.

Two articles report a case of villous-nodular synovitis of the child's hip. Surgical treatment by resection seems to be consensus but various adjuvant treatments are also proposed. A case of villous-nodular synovitis of the hip in children was treated without surgical intervention. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of surgical treatment of villous nodular synovitis of the hip in children.
