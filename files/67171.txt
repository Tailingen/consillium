This is a two-part, non-randomized, open label, single-site Phase I/II study. The first Part A is a dose ranging maximum tolerated dose (MTD) study and Part B is an extension phase to evaluate safety at the selected safe dose. A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will determine the safe dose for testing in the expansion phase (Part B).

Part A will be according to a 3+3 dose escalation design. A total of up to 20 patients will participate in this Part.

Part B will be an expansion phase. The objective will be to determine if the treatment regimen is associated with a clinical response rate that can rule out 5% (p0=0.05) in favor of a modest 20% Partial Response (PR) + Complete Response (CR) rate (p1=0.20).

A total of up to 43 patients may be enrolled in Part B (41 +2, allowing for up to 2 non-evaluable patients).
