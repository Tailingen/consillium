Trial of Pemetrexed Versus Erlotinib in Pretreated Patients With Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
The second-line treatment in advanced NSCLC has been currently proved effective in prolonging overall survival and improving quality of life. Both pemetrexed and erlotinib have been approved for second-line treatment of NSCLC . Erlotinib is a valuable option for the treatment of advanced NSCLC, especially for elderly patients, due to convenience of administration and safety profile. The role of comprehensive geriatric assessment in treatment efficacy and tolerance is an area of investigation.
