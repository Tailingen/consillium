Hypofractionated Radiotherapy Followed by Hypo-boost for Local Advanced NSCLC
The primary objective is to assess the safety and efficacy of hypofractionated radiotherapy followed by hypo-boost combined with concurrent weekly chemotherapy in unresectable LA-NSCLC patients.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
RADIATION: split-course radiotherapy|DRUG: concurrent chemotherapy
progression-free survival, 3 years
overall survival, 3 years|response rate, 2 months|rate of grade 3-4 radiation esophagitis, 1 year|rate of grade 3-4 radiation pneumonitis, 1 year
Patients receive four cycles of weekly docetaxel(25mg/㎡) and nedaplatin(25mg/㎡), each of 1 day's duration, concurrent with split-course thoracic radiotherapy of 40 Gy/10 fractions and 28 Gy/7 fractions administered in the first and second courses, respectively, with one-month break. The primary end point is progression-free survival, which is the time that passes from the first day of radiotherapy to the date at which disease progresses. Progression-free survival will be calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.Toxicities will be graded according to CTCAE v. 4.0.
