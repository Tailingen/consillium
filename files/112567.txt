The grade is based on how much the cancer cells look like normal cells.

* A low grade number (grade 1) usually means the cancer is slower-growing and less likely to spread.
* An intermediate grade number (grade 2) means the cancer is growing faster than a grade 1 cancer but slower than a grade 3 cancer.
* A high grade number (grade 3) means a faster-growing cancer that's more likely to spread., A time of enrollment|Correlate the Presence of HER2 Mutation Subtype With Tumor Staging at Initial Diagnosis, * Staging occurred at initial diagnosis after physical exam, mammogram, and other diagnostic imaging tests.

Overexpression of HER2 due to gene amplification is an established therapeutic target in breast cancer for which multiple HER2 targeted drugs are now available. However, the majority of breast cancers are without HER2 overexpression/non-amplified and not currently eligible to receive HER2 targeted drugs. Advances in tumor genome sequencing technology led to the identification of recurrent HER2 mutations (HER2mut) in approximately 2% of HER2 non-amplified primary breast cancers, and 3-5% of metastatic tumors. Importantly, tumor cells harboring HER2mut are sensitive to the anti-tumor effects of HER2-targeted agents in preclinical models, especially neratinib, a potent irreversible pan-HER inhibitor. However, neratinib monotherapy has demonstrated only modest single agent activity in HER2mut,, non-amplified metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Based on the hypothesis that the combination of neratinib and fulvestrant will be more effective than neratinib alone in ER+/HER2mut, non-amplified MBC the investigators conducted a single arm phase II study of neratinib plus fulvestrant with 2 cohorts, fulvestrant (FUL)-treated and FUL-naïve, for patients with ER+/HER2mut, non-amplified MBC to assess the anti-tumor effects of this combination. An exploratory ER-negative (ER-) HER2mut cohort was also included for the efficacy of neratinib monotherapy.
