A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of XMAB24306 in Combination With Daratumumab in Participants With Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma
This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and activity of XmAb24306 in combination with a multiple myeloma (MM)-targeting monoclonal antibody capable of inducing antibody-dependent cellular toxicity (ADCC) in participants with relapsed or refractory (R/R) MM who have received a minimum of three prior treatments, including at least one immunomodulatory drug (IMiD), one proteasome inhibitor (PI), and one anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody.
