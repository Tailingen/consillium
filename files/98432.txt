Capsule Endoscopy Delivery at sCale Through Enhanced AI anaLysis Study
The CESCAIL study tests the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on a video taken from a minimally-invasive imaging device, to improve efficiency and accuracy of the detection of polyps, which are little outgrowths within the lining of the bowel.

Participants will be continuing to follow their standard care pathway, and there are no additional requirements of the participants other than providing consent for their pseudonymised capsule video and data to be used to test the AI system.

The participant's final diagnosis will only be determined by the clinician's standard analysis pathway and not influenced by the AI enabled analysis pathway. All data is de-identified before a video is created and re-identified only once the standard final report is signed-off by the referring clinician. Therefore, the risk of patient harm due to exposed data is minimised.
