IP ALT-803 Followed by SQ ALT-803 for Ovarian Cancer
This is a single center, randomized phase II study of an IL-15RÎ±-Fc super-agonist complex (ALT-803) given as maintenance therapy after the completion of 1st line IV/IP chemotherapy for the treatment of advanced ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer.

In this study all patients receive four 8 week cycles of ALT-803 consisting of 4 weekly doses followed by a 4 week rest (no treatment). As it is not known how intraperitoneal (IP) administration (a route of drug administration frequently used for gynecologic cancers) of ALT-803 compares to subcutaneous (SQ) administration, both routes of administration will be tested. The primary objective of this trial is to select one method of delivery for further testing.
