A Study of Pemetrexed Plus Cisplatin in Patients With Refractory Soft Tissue Sarcoma
The yearly incidence of soft-tissue sarcomas(STS) in the USA is roughly 11,280 cases, and metastatic STS have a median overall survival of about 12 months. After the standard 1st line chemotherapy with doxorubicin, the only a few treatment option is available. Recently, pemetrexed, a novel multitargeted antifolate, has shown modest activity as a single agent lung cancer and mesothelioma. In patients with refractory STS, pemetrexed is well tolerated and moderately effective. Based on the background, investigators planned to conduct the phase II trial of pemetrexed in combination with cisplatin for metastatic/recurred soft-tissue sarcomas.
