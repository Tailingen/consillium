Quadratus Lumborum Block for Percutaneous Nephrostomy
Percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) is one of the interventions in the radiology department in which pain control is necessary. Quadratus Lumborum (QL) block will be tried to limit the use of systemic analgesics and its accompanying untoward effects in those frail patients requiring PCN that is performed in the prone position.

Quadratus Lumborum block is a novel technique in which extension into the thoracic paravertebral space may occur. QL block would seem to be able to alleviate both somatic and visceral pain so it's expected to decrease the need for systemic sedation\\analgesia to a minimum.
