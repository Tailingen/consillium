Measuring Real Time Decision-Making About Ultraviolet Radiation (UVR) Protection
The purpose of this study is to understand how people make decisions about sun protection. This study is important in helping to protect against sun exposure, since it is a main risk factor for melanoma. The investigators would like to understand the decisions people make about sun protection so that they can improve their ability to help individuals who may be at risk for melanoma.

To generate models explaining decision-making about four UVR protection behaviors (sunscreen use, shade-seeking, hat use, use of protective clothing) in melanoma FDRs., 1 year
To examine theory-driven affective and cognitive predictors of UVR protection maintenance (sunscreen use, shade-seeking, hat use, and use of UVR protective clothing)assessed in real time., 1 year
