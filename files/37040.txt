Electroacupuncture on Treating Cancer-related Depression
Cancer-related depression (CRD) is a common psychological condition among cancer patients during diagnosis, treatment, and recovery, and is associated with reduced quality of life, impaired immune function, and poorer clinical outcomes. As cancer incidence and mortality continue to rise in China, the psychological burden on patients is receiving increasing attention. Electroacupuncture (EA) has shown potential in treating various types of depression and related somatic symptoms, but evidence regarding its efficacy, safety, and long-term effects in CRD remains limited. This randomized controlled trial aims to evaluate the short- and long-term efficacy and safety of EA for CRD, with the goal of providing evidence to support effective and optimized treatment strategies.

Hamilton Depression Rating Scale - 17 items, The HDRS-17 is a clinician-administered scale widely used to assess the severity of depressive symptoms and evaluate treatment efficacy in clinical trials. In this study, the HDRS-17 will be administered by trained raters using structured clinical interviews. The total score ranges from 0 to 52, with higher scores indicating more severe depression. A total score \>17 is considered to reflect at least moderate depression, while a score ≤7 is typically interpreted as remission. Higher scores represent greater symptom severity., Baseline, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16, Week 20, and Week 24.
Remission Rate, Proportion of participants with Hamilton Depression Rating Scale - 17 items score \<8 at Week 12., Week 12|Response Rate, Proportion of participants with ≥50% reduction from baseline in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale - 17 items score at Week 12., Week 12|Patient Health Questionnaire-9, The PHQ-9 is a self-administered instrument used to screen for depression severity and monitor treatment response. It consists of 9 items, each corresponding to DSM-5 criteria for major depressive disorder, rated on a 4-point Likert scale (0 = "not at all" to 3 = "nearly every day"). The total score ranges from 0 to 27, with higher scores indicating more severe depressive symptoms. Score interpretation is as follows: 5-9 = mild, 10-14 = moderate, 15-19 = moderately severe, and 20-27 = severe depression. A reduction in score over time will be used to assess treatment efficacy., Baseline, Week 12, Week 24.|Pain Rating Index, The Pain Rating Index (PRI) is derived from the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ) and is used to evaluate the intensity and quality of pain. It includes 15 descriptors (11 sensory and 4 affective), each rated on a 4-point scale: 0 = "none", 1 = "mild", 2 = "moderate", and 3 = "severe". The PRI is calculated by summing the scores of the individual descriptors, providing a composite measure of both sensory and affective pain dimensions. A higher PRI score indicates more severe pain experience., Baseline, Week 12, and Week 24.|Quality of Life Questionnaire for Cancer Patients, The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a validated, cancer-specific instrument designed to assess health-related quality of life in oncology patients. It comprises five functional scales (physical, emotional, social, cognitive, and role functioning), a global health status/quality of life scale, three symptom scales (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and pain), and several single items assessing additional symptoms (e.g., dyspnea, appetite loss, insomnia, constipation, diarrhea) and financial impact. Each item is rated using a 4-point Likert scale (1 = "not at all" to 4 = "very much"), except for the global health scale, which uses a 7-point numeric scale. Scores are linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale. Higher scores on functional and global health scales indicate better functioning and quality of life, while higher scores on symptom scales represent greater symptom burden., Baseline, Week 12, and Week 24.|Use of Antidepressants, Documented dosage and frequency of antidepressant medication usage through patient-reported medication diaries., Baseline, and Week 12.|Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (TESS), The Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (TESS) is a clinician-rated tool used to systematically evaluate adverse events and treatment-emergent side effects during the course of clinical trials. Symptoms are rated based on presence, severity, and clinical relevance. Each item is scored to reflect the degree of discomfort and interference with function., Through study completion, an average of 6 months
Cancer-related depression (CRD) is a prevalent and complex comorbidity among cancer patients, often arising during diagnosis, treatment, or disease progression. It is associated with a range of psychological and somatic symptoms that significantly reduce quality of life, compromise treatment adherence, and may negatively affect clinical outcomes and overall survival. As cancer incidence and mortality continue to rise in China's aging population, addressing the emotional and psychological burden of cancer has become increasingly important.

Current treatments for CRD largely rely on pharmacological interventions, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). However, these medications often have delayed onset, potential side effects, and limited tolerability in patients undergoing cancer treatment. These limitations highlight the need for safe, non-pharmacological alternatives that can effectively alleviate depressive symptoms in this vulnerable population.

Acupuncture, a traditional Chinese medical therapy, has been widely used for managing depressive disorders and cancer-related symptoms. Electroacupuncture (EA), which combines needling with electrical stimulation, has demonstrated therapeutic potential in preliminary studies for depression and symptom relief in cancer patients. Despite encouraging results, the overall quality of evidence remains low, and rigorous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) focusing specifically on CRD are still lacking.

This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of electroacupuncture in the treatment of CRD through a well-designed, randomized, assessor-blinded controlled trial. The trial will assess both short-term and long-term outcomes in patients with clinically diagnosed CRD, using validated measures for depression severity, quality of life, and symptom burden. Participants will be randomly assigned to either an intervention or control group, and all participants will continue to receive routine care during the study.

The results of this trial will contribute to the growing body of evidence on integrative approaches in cancer care. It aims to determine whether EA can serve as a safe and effective adjunct to conventional cancer treatment, improve patients' emotional well-being, and support a more holistic model of care. This research also aligns with national health strategies promoting integrative medicine and may inform future clinical guidelines for managing psychological distress in cancer populations.
