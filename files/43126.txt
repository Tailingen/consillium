A Study to Evaluate the Safety of LAM561 Added to Standard of Care in Newly-diagnosed Glioblastoma Patients
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of LAM561 added to first-line treatment for subjects with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM), and to determine the highest safe dose of LAM561 administered orally when added to the concurrent phase of treatment with temozolomide (TMZ) and radiation therapy (RT) or when added to the maintenance phase of treatment with TMZ (once TMZ 200 g/m2/day is started).
Glioblastoma (GBM)
DRUG: LAM561|RADIATION: RT|DRUG: TMZ
Safety and Tolerability of LAM561 in association with Standard of Care (Stupp Protocol), Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events., 10 to 12 weeks|Maximum Tolerated dose (MTD), MTD of LAM561 administered with Standard of Care, 10 to 12 months
Plasma concentration of temozolomide (TMZ)., To verify that the administration of LAM561 is not modifying the exposition of patients to TMZ., First five days of cycle 2 of maintenance phase (each cycle is 4 weeks)
This is a Phase IB, open-label, dose-finding study. A de-escalation process has been selected for the study with a 3+3 design to establish the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD).

The first group of 3 subjects (within each arm), where all 3 subjects may be started at the same time, will receive LAM561 at the starting dose of 12 g/day (4 g tid). If 0-1 Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) in the first 3 patients, then a new cohort with 3 more patients is started at 12 g/day (4 g tid). If 2 or more patients out of 3 or 6 patients experience DLT(s) the dose is deescalated.

De-escalation doses are from 12 g/day (4 g tid) to 8 g/day (4 g bid) and from 8 g/day (4 g bid) to 4 g/day (4 g od). This procedure must be applied to the two arms of the study described below. Both arms will be independent, and will run in parallel, therefore none of the patients from Arm 1 may enter Arm 2.
