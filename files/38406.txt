PET Imaging of Cancer Patients Using [18F]-SKI-249380, a Radiolabeled Dasatinib-Derivative
This study is the first time that a new experimental drug called \[18F\]-SKI-249380 is being used in people. \[18F\]-SKI-249380 is not a therapeutic drug. \[18F\]-SKI-249380 is a drug that will be used with PET scanners to 'see' where \[18F\]-SKI-249380 goes in the body, after its injected. The researchers believe that scans with \[18F\]-SKI-249380 might be able to find tumors in patients.

This study is being done to see how long \[18F\]-SKI-249380 stays in the blood, when it is given to people in tiny amounts by an injection into a vein in their arm, and to see where \[18F\]-SKI-249380 goes in the body. If the results of this trial are good, then the study doctors plan to use \[18F\]-SKI-249380 in another trial to see if scans with \[18F\]-SKI-249380 are better for finding tumors compared to the standard types of scans that doctors use.

pharmacokinetics, This will be evaluated by non-invasive blood- and PET-based assays, at multiple time points. Blood/plasma assayed by standard radio-HPLC and/or TCA methods for quantitating activity, metabolites, and plasma protein binding will be performed., approximately 1, 5, 15, 30, and 90 minutes and 3 hours, post-injection
