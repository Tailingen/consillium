Afatinib In Combination With Cisplatin Or Carboplatin + Pemetrexed In Patients With EGFR-Mutant Lung Cancers Undergoing Definitive Chemoradiation
The purpose of this Phase I study is to test the safety of combining afatinib with standard chemotherapy and radiation. The drug afatinib will be given before the chemotherapy and radiation therapy to shrink the tumor and evaluate how afatinib affects the patient. This study will then test the safety of afatinib at different dose levels when combined with the chemotherapy drugs cisplatin or carboplatin, and pemetrexed. These treatments will be given during radiation treatment and the drug afatinib will be continued after chemotherapy and radiation.

maximum tolerated dose, This will be defined as the dose at which fewer than 1:6 patients experiences a dose-limiting toxicity., 1 year
local control rate, will be determined as the proportion of patients who start the concurrent phase who are alive and free of local failure., at 1 year and at 2 years|tolerability of adjuvant afatinib, Tolerability will be defined by in terms of dose reductions, delays and discontinuations of patients who have not had disease progression or death., at 3 months|median progression free survival, PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression of disease or death, whichever occurs first., 2 years|median overall survival, will be calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimates among all patients enrolled., 2 years
