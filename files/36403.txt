NUC-1031 in Patients With Platinum-Resistant Ovarian Cancer
This study was designed to evaluate the effect of two dose levels of NUC-1031 (500 mg/m2 and 750mg/m2) in patients with ovarian cancer. The primary objective was to determine the anti-tumor activity of NUC-1031 at the selected dose level (500 mg/m2 or 750 mg/m2).
Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: NUC-1031 500 mg|DRUG: NUC-1031 750mg
Best Overall Response, Best overall response to study treatment, as assessed by blinded independent central review according to RECIST v1.1, in the evaluable population of patients who received at least one dose of study treatment and had measurable disease at baseline.

Complete Response (CR): disappearance of all target and non-target lesions, normalization of tumor markers, and pathological lymph nodes must have short axis measurements \<10 mm.

Partial Response (PR): ≥30% decrease in the sum of measures of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. Non-target lesions must be non-progressive disease.

Stable Disease (SD): neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters on study.

Progressive Disease (PD): ≥20% increase in the sum of measured lesions taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters recorded on study and an absolute increase of ≥5mm., Assessed from date of randomization until disease progression, up to end of the study (approximately 2 years)
A total of 53 patients were randomized, of whom 51 patients were treated in Part I of the study, 24 patients in the 500 mg/m2 arm and 27 patients in the 750 mg/m2 arm. Eligible, consenting patients received NUC-1031 by IV infusion on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle. Patients continued to receive NUC-1031 until the occurrence of disease progression and underwent imaging every 8 weeks. After disease progression, patients were followed for overall survival.

Part II of the study was designed to select one of the treatment dose levels for further evaluation based on clinical and laboratory assessments of patients recruited in Part I. Despite promising efficacy and a good tolerability profile in Part I, it was decided not to initiate Part II as the pre-specified boundary for efficacy was uncertain to be met in this heavily pre-treated population with significant co-morbidities.
