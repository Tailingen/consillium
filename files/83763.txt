STC-15 as a Part of Combination Therapy With Toripalimab in Selected Advanced Cancers
This early phase oncology trial will be conducted at various study centers to investigate the safety, tolerability, and antitumor activity of STC-15 (a METTL3 inhibitor) in combination with toripalimab (anti- programmed cell death 1 \[PD-1\]) in four different locally advanced unresectable or metastatic tumors such as indications: (1) in combination with toripalimab (anti- programmed cell death 1 \[PD-1\]) in locally advanced and unresectable or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), (2) in combination with toripalimab in locally advanced unresectable or metastatic melanoma, (3) in combination with toripalimab in locally advanced unresectable or metastatic endometrial cancers, and (4) in combination with toripalimab in locally advanced or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).

This study comprises of 2 parts: a combination dose escalation part (Phase 1b) followed by an assessment of the combination treatment's antitumor activity (Phase 2). This study will be conducted in adult participants with advanced malignancies to characterize the safety, tolerability, PK, and clinical activity of STC-15 in combination with toripalimab.
