Internet-based Perioperative Exercise Program in Patients With Barrett's Carcinoma Scheduled for Esophagectomy
This study will evaluate, if an intensive individually adaptated training program via online supervision during neoadjuvant therapy will improve lung function and reduce pulmonary complications following esophagectomy for Barrett's cancer.

Patients undergoing surgery for esophageal cancer have a high risk for postoperative deterioration of lung function and pulmonal complications. This may be partly due to one-lung ventilation during the thoracic part of the operation. This often encounters for prolonged periods of reconvalescence and reduced quality of life, apart from socioeconomic disadvantages. Physical preconditioning has become a crucial leverage to optimize fitness and lung function in patients scheduled for esophagectomy, in particular during the interval of neoadjuvant therapy.
