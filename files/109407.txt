This phase II trial is a single-arm, non-randomized and single-center clinical study.

It is estimated that 30 patients who met the study criteria will be enrolled in PUMCH and treated with Avatrombopag. The investigators will follow up and collect subjects' data each month to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment. Primary outcome measure is percentage of participants whose PLT reaches ≥75×109/L, or increases by ≥50×109/L or ≥100% from baseline at least once within 20 days of initial treatment.

Secondary outcome measure:1)Number of days required for PLT to reach ≥50×109/L after treatment; 2)Number of days required for PLT to reach ≥75×109/L after treatment; 3)Percentage of subjects without platelet transfusion within 20 days of treatment; 4)Percentage of subjects without clinically relevant bleeding within 20 days of treatment.
