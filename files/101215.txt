Identification of Marker of Primary or Acquired Resistance to Anti Tumorous Treatment
Lung Cancer and melanoma relapsed frequently whereas its very sensitive to treatment such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy. The purpose of this study is to have a better understanding of why those patients are relapsing using next generation sequencing to identify rare mutations and assessed their predictive value.
