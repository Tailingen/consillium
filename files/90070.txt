PET Acetate for Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer on Chemotherapy
One purpose of this research study is to examine if a special type of imaging test, a positron emission tomography (PET) scan using the radioactive material \[C-11\] acetate, will be helpful in detecting prostate cancer lesions in subjects with castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). This PET scan will be combined with a computed tomography (CT) scan taken during the same imaging session. The other purpose of the PET-CT scan using \[C-11\] acetate (PET Acetate Scan) is to assist in identifying who is responding to the treatment (docetaxel chemotherapy).

Interpretation of PET Acetate scans, Standardized uptake values (mean and maximum SUVs) will be determined over the prostate bed and over any acetate-avid or CT-identified suspicious lesions. The change in these SUVs with treatment will be assessed, as well as the number of lesions. A blinded second reviewer from Nuclear Medicine will reviewed all baseline and response PET-acetate scans., Time of enrollment up to one year
Prostate cancer response to treatment and progression (excluding PET Acetate assessment), Correlation with chemotherapy response, Time of enrollment up to two years
The purpose of the current pilot clinical trial is to attempt to identify the safety and accuracy of PET-acetate imaging in the assessment of response of persons undergoing first-line docetaxel for CRPC. If successful, the current research could lead to the incorporation of PET-acetate into future study protocols where continuation of chemotherapy is based on early PET-acetate results, provided that effective second-line therapy options are available (which is an expectation for the near future, based on several ongoing and presented phase III trials).
