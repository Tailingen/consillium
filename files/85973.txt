Maintenance Low Dose 5'-Azacitidine Post T Cell Depleted Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation for Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome and Acute Myelogenous Leukemia With High Risk for Post-Transplant Relapse
The purpose of this study is to learn if 5'-Azacitidine will help to lower the risk of the disease coming back after a stem cell transplant in patients with MDS and AML. This study will also be looking at the side effects of this medicine.

5'-Azacitidine is an FDA approved drug for treatment of MDS and AML, as well as patients whose disease came back after transplant, where it helped going into remission. It is unclear if 5'-Azacitidine can prevent the disease from coming back after transplant. This study will help show if getting 5'-Azacitidine soon after transplant can lower the risk of your disease coming back.
Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS)|Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML)
DRUG: low dose 5'-azacitidine
Relapse Rate, Relapse of MDS or AML will be analyzed as to type and genetic origin of the leukemic cells. These will be defined by morphologic and/or cytogenetic criteria: an increasing number of blasts in the marrow over 5%, by presence of circulating blasts, or by presence of blasts in any extramedullary site as well as presence of previous cytogenetic abnormalities. Other studies assessing for MRD, FACS and FISH assays will be evaluated but would not be considered disease relapse if positive since they are experimental., 2 years
Overall Survival, Kaplan-Meier methodology will be used to compare overall survival., 2 years|Number of Participants Evaluated for Treatment Safety, The safety will be described by tabulating the number of transfusions, frequencies of bleeding and serious infections, and the use of G-CSF support., 2 years
