A Phase 1 Study of ADI-001 in B Cell Malignancies
This is a Phase 1 dose escalation study following a 3+3 study design. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ADI-001 in patients with B cell malignancies.

ADI-001 is an investigational immunotherapy composed of allogeneic gamma delta T cells that is being evaluated as a potential treatment for patients diagnosed with B cell malignancies who have relapsed or are refractory to at least two prior regimens. This first-in-human study will assess the safety and tolerability of ADI-001 and is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum assessed dose (MAD). Patients will be administered a single infusion or multiple infusions of ADI-001 cells. The study will include the following two parts:

Part 1 : dose escalation and extension. Parts 1a (escalation) and 1b (extension) will involve escalation and administration of single dose of ADI-001 and multiple doses of ADI-001.

Part 2 : dose expansion will involve dose administration of ADI-001 at MTD/MAD as determined in Part 1.

The study will also assess the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ADI-001.
