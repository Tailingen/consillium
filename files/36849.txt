To compare the effect of ropivacaine versus placebo pectoral nerve block (Pecs 1 and 2) on acute pain after tumorectomy plus sentinel lymph node dissection on one day surgery, Percentage of patients treated with step 2 or 3 analgesics during the first three postoperative hours after tumorectomy plus sentinel lymph node dissection, between the group with RopivacaÃ¯ne and the group with placebo, 3 hours
Evaluation of acute pain at rest and after shoulder movement until 48 postoperative hours, VAS Scale (0 to 10 : 0 = no pain and 10 = Worst pain possible) at rest and after shoulder movement every 30 minutes during the first three postoperative hours in the PACU and the day surgery unit and then at home every 6 hours for the first 48 postoperative hours ., 48 hours|Evaluation of acute pain until 48 postoperative hours, Brief Pain Inventory Questionnaires at 48 hours will be collected with VAS Scale (0 to 10 : 0 = no pain and 10 = Worst pain possible), 48 hours|Evaluation of patient's satisfaction on pain management, Scale of satisfaction ( 0 to 10 : 0 = very bad and 10 = excellent) of the pain management at 48 post-operative hours, 48 hours|Evaluation of Remifentanil consumption during anesthesia, Total dose of Remifentanil during anesthesia for a bispectral index between 40-60 or Analgesia Nociception Index (ANI) \> 60%, 3 hours|Evaluation of analgesic consumption during the first 48 postoperative hours, Consumption of Ketoprofene in systematic, Paracetamol if VAS\>3 and Tramadol if analgesia is not enough during 48 postoperative hours, 48 hours|Evaluation of the incidence of nausea and vomiting during the first 48 postoperative hours, Incidence of nausea and vomiting during the first 48 postoperative hours, 48 hours|Evaluation of complications of Pecs during 48 postoperative hours, Complications of Pecs block: pneumothorax, nerve injury, hypotension, vascular puncture and systemic toxicity of local anaesthetic (seizures, etc.) collected, 48 hours|Evaluation of the incidence of serious adverse events during 30 days, Number of serious adverse events during 30 days after Pecs administration, 30 days
Before surgery, the 3rd interpectoral space will be identified. After aspiration, half of the solution of Ropivacaine 5 mg/ml not exceeding 3 mg/kg of maximal dose and 30 ml of maximal volume or saline (not exceeding 30 ml of maximal volume) will be injected into the interpectoral space underneath the pectoralis major muscle for the Pecs 1 block. The other half of the solution will be injected above the serratus anterior muscle at the third rib.

Evaluation of the percentage of patients treated with step 2 or 3 analgesics during the three postoperative hours.
