ALBATROSS Study: International Multicenter Study for Prospective Validation of Imaging Biomarkers Calculated at Vascular Habitats of High-grade Gliomas
This Clinical study is framed in the ALBATROSS Project: Clinically validated decision support system based on pixel level Artificial Intelligent models for deciding treatment in glioblastoma.

The prospective multicenter international dataset compiled during the ALBATROSS project will include a cohort up to 300 new patients diagnosed with GB after June 1, 2020. Longitudinal images (T1, T2, T1c, FLAIR, PWI-DSC and DWI at least), complete molecular profiling, primary and secondary lines of treatment and clinical conditions will be included for each patient.
Astrocytoma, Grade IV
Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival is defined as the time from the first presurgical MRI is taken to the patient (MR0) to death, From date of inclusion (date of first MRI) until the date of death, assessed up to 48 months
Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression Free Survival is defined as the time from the first presurgical MRI is taken to the patient to the detection of tumor relapse, From date of inclusion (date of first MRI) until the date of documented tumor progression, assessed up to 48 months
The Hypothesis under study in this project is:

Therapeutic decision making during clinical management of patients with glioblastoma may benefit from delineating functional habitats at pixel level relative to growth, proliferation, infiltration and angiogenesis

The Overall Scientific Objectives of the research proposal are to:

OSO1. Delineate functional habitats from multiparametric MRI relative to the growth, proliferation, infiltration and angiogenesis at the enhanced tumor and infiltrated peripheral edema OSO2. Demonstrate that functional habitats at enhanced tumors and infiltrated peripheral edema show structural, cellular and molecular differences related to the heterogeneity of the tumor region and are compatible with mathematical models of glioma growth and infiltration OSO3. Determine the in-vivo molecular sub-type of patients with glioblastoma from image biomarkers in functional habitats OSO4. Identify groups of patients with glioblastoma presenting positive therapeutic response in terms of longer survival using image biomarkers from functional habitats OSO5. Position ONCOhabitats as a clinical decision support system for the management of patients with glioblastoma
