Ixazomib (MLN9708) and Dexamethasone in High Risk Smoldering Multiple Myeloma: A Clinical and Correlative Pilot Study
The purpose of this study is to see what effects, good and/or bad, the combination of ixazomib and dexamethasone has on the patient and the smoldering multiple myeloma.

best response, best overall response rate (PR or better) Stringent Complete Response (sCR) Complete Response as defined below plus: Normal FLC ratio and absence of clonal cells in bone marrow by immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence (presence/absence of clonal cells is based on the kappa/ lambda ratio. Complete Response (CR) Negative immunofixation on the serum and urine and disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas and ≤5% plasma cells in bone marrow Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) Serum and urine M-protein detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis or 90% or greater reduction in serum M-protein plus urine M-protein level \<100mg per 24h Partial Response (PR) ≥50% reduction of serum M-protein and reduction in 24-h urinary M-protein by ≥90% or to \<200mg per 24h. If the serum and urine M-protein are unmeasureable, a ≥50% decrease in the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels is required in place of the M-protein criteria, up to 12 cycles of treatment (28 day cycle)
