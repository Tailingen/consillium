Safety of Oraxol in Breast Cancer Patients, Safety was assessed by evaluating treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) including SAEs, laboratory evaluations (hematology, blood chemistry, and urinalysis), vital signs, physical examinations, and electrocardiograms (ECGs)., From enrollment through study completion, approximately 17 weeks|Response Rate, Tumor response rate and 95% confidence interval (CI) were evaluated based on the number of subjects with any post-baseline CR or PR per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by the Investigator and the ICRRC., From baseline through study completion, around 21 weeks|Progression-free Survival, PFS was analyzed based on the Response Evaluable Population. The Kaplan-Meier (KM) method was used to estimate the medians of these variables with 95% CIs.

The Response Evaluable Population included all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study treatment and had at least 1 posttreatment tumor response evaluation, From baseline through study completion, around 21 weeks|Overall Survival, OS was analyzed based on the Response Evaluable Population. The Kaplan-Meier (KM) method was used to estimate the medians of these variables with 95% CIs.

The Response Evaluable Population included all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study treatment and had at least 1 posttreatment tumor response evaluation, From baseline through study completion, around 21 weeks
This is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm PK study in approximately 24 breast cancer patients for whom paclitaxel treatment is indicated. The study contains 3 periods: the Screening / Baseline Period, the Treatment Period, and the Follow-up Period. A Final Visit will occur within 7 days of the last dose of study treatment. If subjects achieve stable disease (SD), partial response (PR), or complete response (CR) at the end of the Treatment Period, they may continue Oraxol treatment in a separate extension study.
