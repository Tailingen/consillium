Study of Acute Normovolemic Hemodilution (ANH) in People With Ovarian Cancer Who Are Having Cytoreductive Surgery
Participants will be scheduled for primary cytoreductive surgery as part of their standard care. Before surgery, participants will be assigned by chance to a study group. Depending on which group they are in, they will receive either acute normovolemic hemodilution/ANH during surgery or standard surgical management during surgery. The researchers think acute normovolemic hemodilution/ANH may decrease the need for allogenic blood transfusion/ABT in people having primary cytoreductive surgery.

BIOLOGICAL: Acute Normovolemic Hemodilution/ANH
Comparison of the rate of allogenic red blood cell transfusions between the Acute Normovolemic Hemodilution (ANH) and standard of care arm, The primary objective of this study is to determine if ANH reduces the requirement for allogenic red cell transfusions in patients undergoing primary cytoreductive surgery for ovarian cancer., up to 30 days from procedure
