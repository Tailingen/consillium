A Phase 2b Clinical Study With a Combination Immunotherapy in Newly Diagnosed Patients With Glioblastoma
The purpose of this study is to assess progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in newly diagnosed Glioblastoma (GBM) participants treated with IGV-001 as compared with placebo.
Glioblastoma
COMBINATION_PRODUCT: IGV-001 Cell Immunotherapy|COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Placebo|PROCEDURE: Standard of Care (SOC): Radiation Therapy|DRUG: SOC: Temozolomide
Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from randomization to first progression, as determined by the central radiology review group blinded to the study treatment arm, or death., Up to 36 months
Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause., Up to 48 months|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Adverse Device Events (ADE), and Unexpected Adverse Device Events (ADR), An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a product, which does not have a causal relationship with treatment. AEs will be graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5.0 from mild(Grade 1) to death(Grade 5). SAE is an AE which is considered serious if it results in any of the following outcomes: death, life-threatening AE, require hospitalizations/prolongation of hospitalizations, results in persistent or significant disability; results in a congenital anomaly and is a medically important event. An ADE is defined as any AE caused by or associated with use of a device and suspected to be resulting from insufficiencies in the instructions for use, the deployment, the implantation, the installation, the operation, or any malfunction of the medical device. An Unexpected ADR is defined as an adverse reaction, nature or severity of which is not consistent with product information., Up to 36 months|Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Laboratory Assessment Abnormalities, Up to 36 months|Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Vital Signs Measurements, Up to 36 months|Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Physical Examination Findings, Up to 36 months
Time to Deterioration of Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) Score, Time to KPS deterioration is defined as the time from screening to the first date of deterioration of the KPS score. Deterioration of KPS is defined as a stable or increasing steroid dose-dependent stabilization of a KPS score of \<70 over 2 consecutive visits at least 4 weeks apart. KPS is an 11-level score which ranges between 0 (death) to 100 (complete healthy status); a higher score represents a higher ability to perform daily tasks., Up to 36 months|PFS in Participants With O6-methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase (MGMT) With Methylation [MGMT+] and MGMT Without Methylation [MGMT-], PFS is defined as the time from randomization to first progression, as determined by the central radiology review group blinded to the study treatment arm, or death. MGMT status will be determined per epigenetic and tumor proliferation analysis from tissue obtained during surgery., Up to 36 months|OS in Participants With MGMT+ and MGMT-, OS is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. MGMT status will be determined per epigenetic and tumor proliferation analysis from tissue obtained during surgery., Up to 48 months
