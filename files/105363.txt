High Dose Chemotherapy in Oligo-metastatic Homologous Recombination Deficient Breast Cancer
This study investigates the effect of high-dose alkylating chemotherapy compared with standard chemotherapy as part of a multimodality treatment approach in patients with oligo-metastatic breast cancer harboring homologous recombination deficiency.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: carboplatin, thiotepa, and cyclophosphamide|DRUG: chemotherapy (docetaxel, doxorubicin, cyclofosfamide, carboplatin, paclitaxel, gemcitabine)
Event free survival, time from randomization to local recurrence, second primary, distant recurrence or death, whichever comes first, assessed up to 120 months
Difference in median overall survival, time from randomization to death from any cause, assessed up to 120 months|Difference in percentage of patients with grade >2 hematologic toxicity (CTCAE v4.0), Difference in percentage of patients with grade \>2 hematologic toxicity (CTCAE v4.0), 6 months after start of treament|Difference in percentage of patients with grade >2 non-hematologic toxicity (CTCAE v4.0), Difference in percentage of patients with grade \>2 non-hematologic toxicity (CTCAE v4.0), 6 months after start of treatment|Difference in quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30 v 3.0), Difference in quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30 v 3.0), 6 and 12 months post treatment|Difference in event free survival, o Difference in event free survival in the subgroups based on:

* Estrogen receptor status;
* Origin of the oligo-metastatic lesion (lymphnodes versus bone versus visceral metastases);
* Primary or recurrent oligometastatic breast cancer;
* BRCA1 mutation/profile or BRCA2 mutation/profile;
* HRD based on BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation and HRD based on BRCA1-like and/or BRCA2-like profile., assessed up to 120 months
