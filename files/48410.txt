Epithelioid Hemangioma of Bone And Soft Tissue
The controversy surrounding epithelioid hemangioma diagnosis stems from its somewhat aggressive clinical characteristics, including multifocal presentation and occasional lymph node involvement.

The investigators reviewed the clinicopathologic and radiologic characteristics of bone and soft tissue epithelioid hemangioma in patients treated at our institution with available tissue for molecular testing.

The hypothesis is that epithelioid hemangioma may present with multifocal involvement and rare loco-regional lymph node metastasis, but it remains a benign tumor with excellent prognosis.

PROCEDURE: Surgery
Multifocal presentation of patients with epithelioid hemangioma of bone and soft tissue without producing a fatal outcome, The investigators defined multifocal presentation the presence of secondary lesions by imaging at presentation of the disease or during follow-up., 2 years
The investigators retrospectively reviewed patients treated for epithelioid hemangioma of the bone and soft tissue in a single insitution. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pathological, clinical, and radiological characteristics of epithelioid hemangioma arising within bone and soft tissue, in the first cohort of cases where the definitive diagnosis is supplemented by molecular techniques.

The hypothesis is that the improved knowledge regarding this rare entity can more definitively elucidate the benign biology of epithelioid hemangioma.
