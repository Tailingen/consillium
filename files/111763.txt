Anti-hormonal Therapie With Ribociclib in HR-positive / HER2- Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer
This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label, controlled phase II study to test the addition of the CDK4/6 inhibitor ribociclib to anti-hormonal treatment as maintenance therapy in patients with disease control (at least stable disease) after 1st line chemotherapy.

Locally-assessed progression-free survival (PFS), Primary efficacy endpoint is locally-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) defined as the time elapsed between randomization and tumor progression or death from any cause., Up to 39 months
The impact on overall survival, Overall survival (OS) defined as the time elapsed between treatment randomization and death from any cause, Up to 39 months|The clinical benefit rate, Clinical benefit rate (CBR) defined as the proportion of subjects with best response of complete response, partial response, or stable disease for at least 24 weeks, Up to 39 months|Patient reported outcomes, will be assessed using the General Quality of Life questionnaire (FACT-B), which will be filled in at study entry and every three month thereafter., Up to 39 months|Number of participants with adverse events, serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest as assessed by CTCAE v4.03., Number of participants with adverse events, serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest as assessed by CTCAE v4.03 compared between the two treatment-arms., Up to 33 months|The number of patients who reduced, interrupted or permanently discontinued treatment and the reasons for that., The number of patients who reduced, interrupted or permanently discontinued treatment and the reasons for that compared between two treatment-arms., Up to 33 months
Although 1st line chemotherapy is effective in women with HR-positive HER2-negative breast cancer, PFS is usually around 6-8 months and 2nd or 3rd line treatments are by far less effective. Well tolerated maintenance treatments with the potential to prolong PFS and even OS are urgently needed. This study evaluates the impact of the addition of a CDK4/6 inhibitor to an anti-hormonal maintenance treatment of physiciansÂ´ choice.
