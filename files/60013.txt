To Explore the Feasibility of Dynamic Changes of TCR Diversity in Peripheral Blood in Monitoring Recurrence and Evaluating Prognosis of Epithelial Ovarian Cancer
This project proposes to elucidate the functional impact of T cells in cancer progression and treatment through a comprehensive TCR profiling study and a longitudinal cohort study in patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer. Our findings aim to provide clinical insights for monitoring treatment response in a non-invasive way and demonstrate the association of TCR diversity with clinical outcomes and the potential role of TCR profiling in cancer prognosis.
Epithelial Ovarian Cancer|Stage III Ovarian Cancer|Stage IV Ovarian Cancer
Analysis of TCR genealogy data, 1. Analysis of TCRα and TCRβ profile profiles in advanced EOC patients before initial treatment;
2. Analysis of differences in diversity of TCRα and TCRβ profiles in advanced EOC patients before treatment, after completion of treatment and at relapse;
3. Analysis of longitudinal TCR profiles revealing the stability and individual specificity of the immune profiles;
4. correlation of TCRα and TCRβ profiling diversity with levels of tumour markers (ca125, ca199, CEA, HE-4) and imaging findings under continuous monitoring to explore their value in monitoring tumour treatment response
5. Differential analysis of dynamic changes in TCRα profile and TCRβ profile in correlation with patients' clinical outcomes, 5 years
