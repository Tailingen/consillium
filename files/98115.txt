A Telehealth Advance Care Planning Intervention
The objective of this project is to conduct a pilot randomized trial to assess the preliminary efficacy of a telehealth-delivered Serious Illness Care Program on healthcare communication, patient anxiety and distress, as well as completion of advance directives (specifically MOLST and healthcare proxy forms) for older patients with acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and similar myeloid malignancies.

Healthcare Communication: Health Care Climate Questionnaire, 5-item questionnaire assessing patients' and caregivers' satisfaction with patient-clinician communication, range 0-20; higher score is better, Month 2
Distress: Distress Thermometer, 1-item question for distress, range 0-10; higher scores indicate greater distress, Month 2|Anxiety Symptoms: Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), 7-item screening tool for anxiety symptoms, total range 0-21); higher scores indicate greater anxiety symptoms, Month 2|Completion of advance directives, Percentage of patients who complete advance directives which include the Medical or Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (MOST/POLST) forms, living will, durable power of attorney for healthcare, and healthcare proxy forms, as well as date of completion, Throughout the study, up to 2 years
The Serious Illness Care Program (SICP) is an evidence-based intervention to enhance serious illness conversations between physicians and patients with advanced cancer. It consists of the Serious Illness Conversation Guide as well as training and system-level support for clinicians to conduct serious illness conversations. The investigators have previously adapted the SICP to be delivered via telehealth for older adults with myeloid malignancies. In this study, they will conduct a pilot randomized trial to assess the preliminary efficacy of a telehealth-delivered Serious Illness Care Program compared to an education control.
