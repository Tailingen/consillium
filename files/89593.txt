Navelbine And Radiotherapy in Locally Advanced Lung Cancer
This study is an open label randomized multi-centre phase II trial in patients with inoperable locally advanced stage IIB-IIIB Non Small Cell Lung Cancer who fulfils the general criteria for curatively intended irradiation. The treatment plan consists of two courses of inductions chemotherapy followed of concomitant therapy chemo-radiotherapy 3 weeks after day 1 of the last induction chemotherapy has been given. The patients will be included in the study after completing the induction chemotherapy. Randomization will take place only if an acceptable dose plan can be obtained.
