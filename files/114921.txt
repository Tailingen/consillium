Efficacy of Supplement Adjuvant Capecitabine in HR+/HER2- Breast Cancer Patients With High Risks
According to the latest data from the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) for 2020, breast cancer has been the most prevalent cancer with 2.26 million new cases. Among Chinese breast cancer patients, approximately 60% are hormone receptor (HR) positive, and 80% have early-stage breast cancer. For HR-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) negative breast cancer patients, the first peak of recurrence is about 2-3 years after surgery, especially for patients with high-risk clinical and/or pathological features. Therefore, adjuvant therapy is essential to reduce recurrence during this period.

Capecitabine is an anti-metabolite fluoropyrimidine deoxynucleoside carbamate that can be converted to fluorouracil (5-Fu) in vivo. Studies have shown that patients with HR-positive HER2-negative breast cancer with high-risk factors may benefit from postoperative adjuvant capecitabine therapy as well as patients with triple-negative breast cancer. Therefore, we assumed that additional capecitabine may reduce the reccurence of breast cancer in patients with high-risk factors.

This trial is an open, single-arm clinical trial designed to investigate the effect of additional adjuvant capecitabine therapy on recurrence and survival in HR-positive HER2-negative breast cancer patients with high-risk factors.
