First In Human Study of CX-2051 in Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of this first-in-human study, CTMX-2051-101, is to characterize the safety, tolerability, and antitumor activity of CX-2051 in adult participants with advanced solid tumors.
Solid Tumor, Adult
DRUG: CX-2051
Safety and tolerability of CX-2051, The number of participants experiencing a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) as defined in the protocol, AEs (adverse events), and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) at any dose level, 44 months|Determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), The number of participants experiencing a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) as defined in the protocol, AEs (adverse events), and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) at any dose level, 44 months
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR defined as the proportion of participants who achieve a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 by Investigator assessment, 60 months|Duration of response (DOR), DOR defined as the time from the first documentation of confirmed CR or PR (based on RECIST v1.1) to the first documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause on study, whichever occurs first., 60 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS defined as the time from the first dose of study intervention to the date of first documentation of objective tumor progression (based on RECIST v1.1) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., 60 months|Disease control rate (DCR), DCR defined as the proportion of participants with confirmed CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) as per RECIST v1.1 by Investigator assessment., 60 months|Duration of disease control (DODC), DODC defined as the time from the first documentation of confirmed CR, PR, or SD (based on RECIST v1.1) to the first documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause on study, whichever occurs first., 60 months|Overall survival (OS), OS defined as the time from the first dose of study intervention to death due to any cause, 60 months
The study is comprised of 2 parts. Part 1 involves CX-2051 dose escalation to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CX-2051. Part 2 (dose expansion) will further assess safety and tolerability as well as preliminarily assess antitumor activity of CX-2051 in indication-specific expansion cohorts.
