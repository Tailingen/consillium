Everolimus Plus Rituximab for Relapsed/Refractory Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma
Everolimus is an oral mTOR inhibitor with demonstrated preliminary efficacy and safety in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in both preclinical and clinical studies. The purpose of this research study is to determine whether Everolimus plus rituximab is safe and effective in participants with relapsed or refractory DLBCL. Everolimus is an investigational drug that works by blocking a special protein that helps cancer cells grow. The safety and effectiveness of Everolimus in the treatment of DLBCL has not yet been fully determined and is still investigational. The other drug in this study, rituximab, is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in patients who have diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and certain other types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Rituximab is a drug that destroys both normal and cancerous B-cells.
Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Everolimus|DRUG: rituximab
Overall Response Rate, Complete response plus partial response after 6 cycles. Response rate will be evaluated by using the modified Cheson criteria for lymphoma response. Complete response requires all of the following: 1) PET positive prior to therapy: mass of any size permitted if PET negative. Variable FDG-avid or PET negative prior to therapy: regression to normal size on CT (\</= 1.5cm in their greatest transverse diameter for nodes \>/= 1.5 cm before therapy) 2) Spleen (if enlarged before therapy) must have regressed in size and must not be palpable, 3) If bone marrow is known to be involved, repeat biopsy documents clearance. Partial response requires 1) \>/= 50% decrease in SPD, 2) No new sites of disease or increase in the size of other nodes, liver or spleen, 3) Splenic and hepatic nodules must regress by at least 50% in SPD, Assessed at the conclusion of cycle 2, cycle 4 and cycle 6
Duration of Overall Response, Duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for complete response or partial response until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented., 2 years|Progression-free Survival, Progression-free survival is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of documentation of progression or death, 2 years
Participants will receive oral Everolimus and intravenous rituximab for DLBCL that has relapsed or been refractory to prior therapy.

* Each treatment cycle lasts 28 days (4 weeks). Everolimus will be taken orally, once daily in the morning.
* Rituximab will be administered by an intravenous (IV) infusion on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of Cycle 1. In Cycles 2-6, rituximab will be administered only on Day 1 of each cycle.
* Participants will come into the clinic weekly during the first cycle, then on Day 1 of all cycles thereafter. The following tests and procedures will be performed:
* Weekly During Cycle 1: blood tests
* Day 1 of all Subsequent Cycles: brief physical examination; review of current medications, treatments, symptoms and side effects; vital signs; performance status evaluation; blood tests.
* A full body CT and PET scan to assess the participants tumor will be done within 7 days of completing cycles 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12.

Responding subjects may receive up to 6 cycles of Everolimus plus rituximab, and an additional 6 months of oral Everolimus for participants continuing to respond.
