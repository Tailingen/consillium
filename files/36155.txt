This is a multicenter, open label phase I clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profile of BH009 in patients with advanced squamous head and neck cancer (non-nasopharyngeal) and ovarian cancer, and to initially explore its clinical effectiveness. This study will use a "3+3" dose escalation design to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of BH009.
