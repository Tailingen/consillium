Dose Optimization in 3D Pulsed Dose Rate Brachytherapy for Patients With Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer
This prospective phase II trial study aims to optimize the increase in dose to the target volume at high risk (85 to 90 Gy over 90% of its volume) and the intermediate target volume (60 Gy to 90 % of its volume) in 3D Pulsed Dose Rate Brachytherapy in treating patients with locally advanced cervical cancer.

Increase the local control rate, Increasing local control in two years (from 71.0% to 86.7%) will be achieved by increasing the dose to the target volume (CTV and CTV-HR-RI) measured dose volume histograms, 24 months
Maintain the cumulative rate grade III and IV complications below 6.5%, 24 months|Relationship between the doses delivered to the target volume and local control, 24 months|Relationship between the doses delivered to the critical organs and rate of grade III and IV complications, 24 months
* The causes of treatment failure and death in cervical cancer are still often linked to a local cancer progression
* The importance of local control for healing, than the cervix situation in the center of pelvis between bladder and rectum which are sensitive organs to irradiation justify the use of utero-vaginal brachytherapy
* This open label, multicenter, phase II study evaluates the benefit of increasing in dose to the target volume at high risk and the intermediate target volume in 3D Pulsed Dose Rate Brachytherapy in treating patients with locally advanced cervical cancer.
* Local control and tolerance are evaluated
