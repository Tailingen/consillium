Evaluation by MRI of Anal Canal Cell Carcinoma: is There Predictive Factor?
Anal canal cell carcinoma is a very rare cancer but well treated. If the morphological test are well established in the initial evaluation, it's not the case of the follow up evaluation particularly by MRI.About 1/3 of patient decline with metastatic relapse during the follow up of these patients.It appears that clinical regression seen precociously is a predictive factor of survival without relapse. But there 's no study confirming that point.

This context takes us to evaluate if there is a predictive factor in MRI to final clinical result.
Anal Carcinoma
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: MRI sequence
Distance with regard to the anal margin, tumor position, maximum of 6 years after the initial MRI|initial tumor size, Maximal tumoral size in the cranio-caudal plan in cm, maximum of 6 years after the initial MRI|presence of nodal status, presence of nodal status in inguinal region, maximum of 6 years after the initial MRI
