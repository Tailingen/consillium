Prophylactic Antibiotics in Cystectomy With Diversion
Using a randomized 2 arm design, this study is being conducted to test for non-inferiority of no prophylactic antibiotic therapy versus the prophylactic oral antibiotic, nitrofurantoin, through comparison of rates of postoperative urinary tract infections within the 90-day postoperative period in patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer who undergo radical cystectomy with urinary diversion.

2-sample, 2-sided, t-test for a difference in proportions. Statistical hypothesis: H0: R1 - R2 = 0, Hα: R1 - R2 ≠ 0, where R1 is the risk (proportion) of UTI infection within the first 30 days, post operation, among those in the treatment group, and R2 among placebo., 30 and 90 days
