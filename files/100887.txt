A Study of the Safety of Atezolizumab in Participants With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer in Argentina
This is a study of the safety and effectiveness of atezolizumab in participants with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy. Participants also will have progressed on an appropriate approved targeted therapy if their tumor has epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene abnormalities treated in common clinical practice settings in Argentina.
