Dose Escalation Study of ARQ 736 in Adult Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors Harboring BRAF and/or NRAS Mutations
This is an open-label, Phase 1, dose escalation study of oral ARQ 736 administered to subjects with advanced solid tumors harboring the mutation. The study is designed to explore the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ARQ 736 and to define a recommended Phase 2 dose of ARQ 736.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: ARQ 736
Assess safety and tolerability of study drug in subjects with advanced solid tumors who have BRAF and/or NRAS mutations, Up to treatment discontinuation + 30 days with an estimated treatment duration of 24 weeks
Assess pharmacokinetic profile, During first cycle of treatment (28 days)|Assess pharmacodynamic activity, During first cycle of treatment (28 days) plus Day 1 of each consecutive cycle with an estimated treatment duration of 24 weeks|Determine preliminary evidence of activity, Up to treatment discontinuation with an estimated treatment duration of 24 weeks|Determine recommended Phase 2 dose, Up to treatment discontinuation with an estimated treatment duration of 24 weeks
Treatment will be initiated at a dose level of 450 mg twice daily (900 mg/daily). All cycles/cohorts of therapy will consist of the oral administration of ARQ 736 twice or four times a day, one hour prior to or two hours after the meal for 28 days continuously. Tumor assessments (CT scan or MRI) will be performed at Baseline, and every two cycles (every eight weeks) thereafter or as otherwise clinically indicated. For early assessment of evidence of biological activity of the tumor PET scan may be performed at Baseline and four weeks from the administration of the first dose of ARQ 736 (approximately Cycle 2 Day1).
