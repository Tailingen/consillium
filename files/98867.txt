Atorvastatin Treatment of Cavernous Angiomas With Symptomatic Hemorrhage Exploratory Proof of Concept (AT CASH EPOC) Trial
This phase I/II randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, single-site clinical trial is designed to investigate the effect of a prolonged course of atorvastatin versus placebo on CCM lesional iron deposition assessed by validated quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) MRI studies in patients who suffered a symptomatic bleed within the preceding one year.
Cerebral Cavernous Malformation
DRUG: Atorvastatin|OTHER: Placebo
mean percent change in lesional QSM per year (called the change score), Each patient contributes two outcome measurements (at year 1 and year 2) based on intention-to-treat. Evaluation of the intervention on this outcome will be performed as a time-averaged difference between two arms using a repeated measures analysis implemented as an unadjusted linear mixed model. Patients with outcome measurements in both periods will be included in the initial intention-to-treat analysis. In cases with multiple lesions, only QSM measurements in the lesion with initial hemorrhage (index lesion) shall be considered for the primary outcome assessment., End of study (24-month) MRI scan|Percent QSM change per year, A secondary analysis of the percent QSM change per year shall be conducted per treatment rendered for all patients with at least one annual epoch of measurements., End of study (24-month) MRI scan
Changes in DCEQP vascular permeability measurements in the index lesion and in brain (white matter far from lesion), Changes in DCEQP vascular permeability measurements in the index lesion and in brain (white matter far from lesion), End of study (24-month) MRI scan|Rates of QSM and DCEQP biomarker events, Rates of QSM and DCEQP biomarker events, representing increases in index lesional QSM or DCEQP above previously articulated "biomarker thresholds"; rates of clinically overt hemorrhages in the index lesion per adjudicated criteria; and rates of lesional expansion, defined as an increase in maximum lesion diameter on T2 sequences by 2 or more mm, End of study (24-month) MRI scan|Adverse event rates, End of study (24-month) MRI scan|Serious adverse event rates, End of study (24-month) MRI scan|Drug compliance by tracking daily medication log in study app, The investigators plan to use a study phone app to have subjects log daily medication use, thus allowing the study team to track compliance with the protocol and help keep subjects accountable., End of study (24-month) MRI scan|Changes in functional outcome as measured using the modified Rankin scale which measures the degree of disability or dependence in patients with neurological disability., Using the modified Rankin scale, the investigators will track subjects' functional outcome changes over the course of the trial., End of study (24-month) MRI scan|Impact of sex on primary and secondary outcomes (pre specified subgroup analyses), End of study (24-month) MRI scan|Impact of genotype on primary and secondary outcomes (pre specified subgroup analyses), End of study (24-month) MRI scan|Impact of lesion location on primary and secondary outcomes (pre specified subgroup analyses), End of study (24-month) MRI scan
This phase I/II randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, single-site clinical trial is designed to investigate the effect of a prolonged course of atorvastatin versus placebo on CCM lesional iron deposition assessed by validated quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) MRI studies in patients who suffered a symptomatic bleed within the preceding one year. Subjects will also be assessed by lesional and brain vascular permeability MRI using dynamic contrast enhanced quantitative perfusion (DCEQP) and a number of clinical evaluation tools. Subjects shall be followed for 2 years from randomization, the period of highest likelihood of rebleed after a recent CCM hemorrhage. Subjects will undergo clinical and MRI evaluations at baseline, and at 12 and 24 months during the study period. Enrolled subjects and the treating team will be blinded to treatment group allocation.
