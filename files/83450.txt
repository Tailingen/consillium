PBMT for the Prevention of CIPN
ne of the most common cancers in women worldwide is breast cancer. A common used therapy in early-stage and metastatic breast cancer involves chemotherapy. Taxanes, microtubule-targeting agents (MTAs), are one of the most used chemotherapeutic agents in breast cancer patients. Unfortunately, this treatment comes with many unfortunate side effects. Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is one of these common side effects. This condition involves paresthesia, numbness and/or burning pain in distal limbs. Eventually, loss of temperature sensation, loss of tendon reflexes and pain sensation can occur. Yet, no therapies have been developed to treat CIPN. At the moment, only symptom management is possible. Not only will this condition affect the patients' daily activities, but a chemotherapy dose reduction could also be necessary, influencing the outcome and overall survival rate of the patient.

A new and emerging treatment for CIPN is photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) or low-level laser therapy. During PBMT, visible and/or (near)-infrared laser light is used at the affected area to improve tissue repair and thereby promote functional recovery of peripheral nerves. Studies have shown positive results for patients with diabetic neuropathy. However, no studies have been undertaken specifically for taxane-induced neuropathy (TIN).

We hypothesize that PBMT is an effective treatment strategy to prevent sensory symptoms associated with TIN. This can lead to an improved quality of life for the patient and no need for a chemotherapy dose reduction.
