A Phase 2, Open-Label Study of Amuvatinib in Combination With Platinum-Etoposide Chemotherapy in Small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and potential benefit of combination amuvatinib with standard of care chemotherapy treatment (platinum and etoposide) in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) subjects.

Amuvatinib is an oral multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor which inhibits the mutant forms of c-Kit and PDGFR alpha. It also disrupts DNA repair likely through suppression of Homologous Recombination protein Rad51. In a Phase 1b clinical study in combination with VP-16 and carboplatin, responses in SCLC were observed. In vitro and in vivo data demonstrated amuvatinib synergy with VP-16 thereby further supporting this combination for continued evaluation in clinical trials. Pharmacokinetic data from Phase 1 clinical trials suggest that co-administration of amuvatinib did not alter exposures of standard of care agents VP-16 or carboplatin as measured by overall exposure.
