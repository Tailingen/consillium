Study of Sipuleucel-T W/ or W/O Radium-223 in Men With Asymptomatic or Minimally Symptomatic Bone-MCRPC
This clinical trial studies the effect of radium-223 when added to sipuleucel-T for treating castrate-resistant prostate cancer that has spread to the bone. Sipuleucel-T is an autologous cellular immunotherapy designed to stimulate an immune response against prostate cancer. It has been suggested that the immune response may be strengthened by radiation therapy. Therefore this study is testing whether radium-223 added to sipuleucel-T increases the immune response and anti-tumor effect against prostate cancer.

Peripheral PA2024 Specific T-cell Proliferation as Measured by Stimulation Index Over Time, Mean peripheral PA2024 specific T-cell proliferation using a 3H-thymidine incorporation assay reported as SI (Stimulation Index \[3H-thymidine incorporation in the presence of antigen divided by 3H-thymidine incorporation with media alone\] ) at baseline and 6, 10, 14, 26, 39, and 52 weeks after the first infusion of sipuleucel-T., Up to 52 weeks|Time to Radiographic or Clinical Progression, Number of weeks from baseline until radiographic or clinical progression, whichever comes first. Radiographic progression is assessed by RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) and PCWG2 criteria (Prostate Cancer Working Group 2). Per RECIST, progression is defined as ≥ 20% and ≥ 5 mm from nadir of the sum of the diameters of target lesions. Per PCWG2 criteria, radiographic progression is defined as ≥ 20% sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or ≥ 2 new lesions on bone scan from baseline. Clinical progression is defined as new spinal cord or nerve root compression, new pathologic fracture or use of opioid analgesics for cancer-related pain., Up to 2 years|PSA50 Response (at Least a 50% Decline in PSA), Number of participants with PSA50 response defined as at least a 50% decline in Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) from baseline value, Up to 2 years|Peripheral PAP Specific T-cell Proliferation as Measured by Stimulation Index Over Time, Mean peripheral PAP specific T-cell proliferation using a 3H-thymidine incorporation assay reported as SI (Stimulation Index \[3H-thymidine incorporation in the presence of antigen divided by 3H-thymidine incorporation with media alone\] ) at baseline and 6, 10, 14, 26, 39, and 52 weeks after the first infusion of sipuleucel-T, Up to 52 weeks|Peripheral PA2024 Specific T-cell Activation, Mean peripheral PA2024 specific T-cell activation to sipuleucel-T using interferon gamma (IFNγ) enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT), as measured by cells per 300,000 PBMCs at baseline and weeks 6, 10, 14, 26, 39, and 52 weeks after the first infusion of sipuleucel-T., Up to 52 weeks|Peripheral PAP Specific T-cell Activation, Mean peripheral PAP specific T-cell activation to sipuleucel-T using interferon gamma (IFNγ) enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) measured as cells per 300,000 PBMCs at baseline and weeks 6, 10, 14, 26, 39, and 52 weeks after the first infusion of sipuleucel-T., Up to 52 weeks|PA2024 Specific Antibody (IgM) Response, Mean titer of PA2024 specific antibody (IgM) response to sipuleucel-T using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at baseline and weeks 6, 10, 14, 26, 39, and 52 weeks after the first infusion of sipuleucel-T., Up to 52 weeks|PA2024 Specific Antibody (IgG) Response, Mean titer of PA2024 specific antibody (IgG) response to sipuleucel-T using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at baseline and weeks 6, 10, 14, 26, 39, and 52 weeks after the first infusion of sipuleucel-T., Up to 52 weeks|PAP Specific Antibody (IgG) Response Over Time, Mean titer of PAP specific antibody (IgG) response to sipuleucel-T using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at baseline and weeks 6, 10, 14, 26, 39, and 52 weeks after the first infusion of sipuleucel-T., Up to 52 weeks|PAP Specific Antibody (IgM) Response, Mean titer of PAP specific antibody (IgM) response to sipuleucel-T using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at baseline and weeks 6, 10, 14, 26, 39, and 52 weeks after the first infusion of sipuleucel-T., Up to 52 weeks|Sipuleucel-T Product Immune Parameters as Assessed by Number of CD54+ Cells, Mean number of CD54 + cells, Up to 4 weeks|Sipuleucel-T Product Immune Parameters as Assessed by CD54+ Upregulation, Mean CD54+ Upregulation of Sipuleucel-T, Up to 4 weeks|Sipuleucel-T Product Immune Parameters as Assessed by Total Nucleated Cell Count, Mean number of Total Nucleated Cells, Up to 4 weeks
This is a randomized study designed to assess the antigen-specific immune response of sipuleucel-T with or without radium-223. Eligible subjects will be registered and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive sipuleucel-T and radium-223 or sipuleucel-T alone.

Subjects in both arms (sipuleucel-T and radium) will undergo a standard 1.5 to 2.0 blood volume leukapheresis, followed approximately 3 days later by an IV infusion of sipuleucel-T. This process will occur a total of 3 times at approximately 2-week intervals. Subjects in Arm 1 will receive a total of 6 infusions of radium-223 at IV dose of 50 kBq/kg at 4-week interval.

All participants are allowed to receive the best supportive care which includes secondary hormonal manipulation as required. No chemotherapy, external-beam radiation, or other radionuclides are allowed while on active treatment but are permitted after completion of active treatment. Glucocorticoid-containing treatments should be minimized to less than the equivalent dose of prednisone 10mg daily if feasible for the 3 months following sipuleucel-T therapy. All patients continue medical or surgical castration during treatment.
