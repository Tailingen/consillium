Safety and Efficacy of CS1 CAR-T (WS-CART-CS1) in Subjects With Multiple Myeloma
Despite recent therapeutic advances, multiple myeloma (MM) remains an incurable disease. Although survival has improved, there are nevertheless diminishing durations of response to each subsequent line of therapy. This highlights the need for further therapeutic innovation. BCMA-targeting CAR-T cells show impressive response rates; however, their median duration of response is disappointing. The investigators propose that CS1(SLAMF7)-targeting CAR-T cells will fill a gap in the MM armamentarium.

CS1 is an attractive target in MM because it is expressed in most patients. Elotuzumab (Empliciti®), an approved anti-CS1 antibody, has proven the clinical efficacy of this target. CAR-T cells are an ideal modality to target CS1, given that two approved treatments, ide-cel (idecabtagene vicleucel, AbecmaTM) and cilta-cel (ciltacabtagene autoleucel, Carvykti™), have proven the potential for cellular immunotherapy in MM.

The investigators are testing the safety and preliminary anti-myeloma efficacy of WS-CART-CS1, a CAR-T cell therapy targeting CS1.
Multiple Myeloma
BIOLOGICAL: WS-CART-CS1|DRUG: Lymphodepleting chemotherapy
Part A: Frequency and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events, -Graded by CTCAE v 5.0., From leukapheresis through 24 months after WS-CART-CS1 infusion (approximately 24 months and 1 week)|Part A: Frequency of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), DLTs are defined as any Grade 3 to 5 toxicity occurring within the 28 days post infusion of WS-CART-CS1 determined to be at least possibly related to WS-CART-CS1. There are some exceptions to this and there are listed in the study protocol., From WS-CART-CS1 infusion through 28 days|Part B: Frequency and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events, -Graded by CTCAE v 5.0., From leukaphereis through 24 months after WS-CART-CS1 infusion (approximately 24 months and 1 week)
Part A MTD and Part B: Disease-specific objective response rate (ORR), -Defined as stringent complete response (sCR), plus complete response (CR), plus very good partial response (VGPR), plus partial response (PR), plus minimal response (MR) in MM within 3 months of infusion using the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) response criteria in MM., Within 3 months of WS-CART-CS1 infusion|Part A MTD and Part B: Minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity in the marrow, -Based on next-generation flow (NGF), next-generation sequencing (NGS), or both, Week 12|Part A MTD and Part B: Duration of response (DoR), -DoR for subjects who respond to treatment is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for response (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that relapse or progression is objectively documented., -From response 24 months after WS-CART-CS1 infusion (estimated to be 24 months)|Part A MTD and Part B: Progression-free survival (PFS), -PFS is measured from Day 0 to time of relapse, progression or death, whichever occurs first., From WS-CART-CS1 infusion through completion of follow-up (estimated to be 15 years)|Part A MTD and Part B: Overall survival (OS), -OS is defined as the time from start of treatment (Day 0) to time of death., From WS-CART-CS1 infusion through completion of follow-up (estimated to be 15 years)
