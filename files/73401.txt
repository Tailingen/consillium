Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Pemigatinib in Participants With Previously Treated Glioblastoma or Other Primary Central Nervous System Tumors Harboring Activating FGFR1-3 Alterations
This is an open-label, monotherapy study of pemigatinib in participants with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM) or other recurrent gliomas, circumscribed astrocytic gliomas, and glioneuronal and neuronal tumors with an activating FGFR1-3 mutation or fusion/rearrangement. This study consists of 2 cohorts, Cohorts A, and B, and will enroll approximately 82 participants into each cohort. Participants will receive pemigatinib 13.5 mg QD on a 2-week on-therapy and 1-week off-therapy schedule as long as they are receiving benefit and have not met any criteria for study withdrawal.
Glioblastoma|Adult-type Diffuse Gliomas
DRUG: Pemigatinib
Cohort A: Overall Response Rate (ORR), Defined as the proportion of participants in Cohort A who achieve a best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) as determined by an Independent Central Radiology (ICR)., Up to 3 months
Cohort B : ORR, Defined as the proportion of participants who achieve a CR or PR based on RANO. Response will be determined by an ICR review., up to 3 months|Cohorts A and B combined: ORR, Defined as the proportion of participants in Cohorts A and B who achieve a BOR of CR or PR based on RANO as determined by an ICR., Up to 3 months|Cohorts A and B: Disease Control Rate (DCR), Defined as the proportion of participants who achieve a CR, PR, or SD as assessed by ICR in cohorts A and B respectively, Up to 3 months|Cohorts A and B: Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Defined as the time from first dose until progressive disease (according to RANO and assessed by an ICR) or death (whichever occurs first) in cohorts A and B, respectively, Up to 3 months|Cohorts A and B: Overall Survival (OS), Defined as the time from first dose of study drug to death due to any cause in cohorts A and B respectively, Up to 3 months|Safety and tolerability, Safety and tolerability in each cohort, assessed by monitoring the frequency and severity of AEs according to NCICTCAE v5.0., Up to 3 months|Cohorts A and B : Duration Of Response (DOR), Defined as the time from first assessment of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) until progressive disease (according to RANO and assessed by an ICR), or death (whichever occurs first) in cohorts A and B, respectively, up to 3 months
