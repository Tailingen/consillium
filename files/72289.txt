Thalidomide and Dacarbazine for Metastatic Melanoma
The purpose of this clinical trial is to assess the activity of thalidomide in combination with dacarbazine (DTIC) in patients with metastatic melanoma. Safety and toxicity of the two drugs will also be assessed. Dacarbazine is the standard medical treatment for metastatic melanoma. It has been shown to produce tumor shrinkage in approximately 20% of patients with advanced melanoma. This shrinkage is usually incomplete and lasts a short time. Thalidomide is a drug that inhibits tumor blood vessel growth. It can be given orally. It is hoped that this combination can be given to patients with metastatic melanoma without causing too much toxicity while increasing the response rate.
