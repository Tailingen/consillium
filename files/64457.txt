Colon Cancer Prevention Study
The goal of this research study is to design messages which can help people learn more about how to prevent colon cancer. Eligible participants will be asked to review a series of short cancer prevention messages and share their opinions on them. Participants also need to fill out a short survey with questions on their background and attitudes and knowledge about physical activity and colon cancer. The whole study can be completed online and will take less than 1 hour. After completing the entire study, participants will receive $25.

Behavioral Intention to Engage in Colorectal Cancer Screening or Physical Activity, This study is to be completed in one session. The outcome is measured immediately after reading messages
The goal of this research is to develop and test potential intervention messages which can be used to help increase colon cancer prevention behaviors. Two sets of intervention messages will be developed: generic and behavioral. Using a randomized control design the investigators will evaluate the behavioral messages among women. This message testing protocol will help them determine if the messages are relevant, acceptable, comprehensible, memorable, and motivating for the target audience. The investigators' hypothesis is that the behavioral messages will receive more positive ratings than the generic messages. If so, they will be used to promote cancer screening and physical activity in future intervention studies.
