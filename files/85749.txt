Study of Bevacizumab in Combination With Chemoimmunotherapy and Atezolizumab in Patients With Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer and Liver Metastases
This clinical trial aims to assess whether the addition of bevacizumab to atezolizumab and chemotherapy can improve response to treatment and progression-free survival in patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) with liver metastases.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

* In patients with ES-SCLC with liver metastases, can bevacizumab in combination with atezolizumab and chemotherapy prolong the length of time that the cancer does not progress?
* Is bevacizumab safe and tolerable when combined with atezolizumab and chemotherapy in patients with ES-SCLC and liver metastases?

The study treatment includes two phases:

* Induction phase: bevacizumab will be administered in combination with atezolizumab and chemotherapy on a 21-day cycle for four cycles.
* Maintenance: atezolizumab and bevacizumab will be administered every 21 days for up to 12 months, or until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

Participants will undergo blood tests every 3 weeks and tumor assessments every 6 weeks.

DRUG: Bevacizumab
6- month Progression Free Survival (PFS) rate, Proportion of patients with first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause (whichever occurs first), Start of study treatment to 6-months
Progression Free Survival (PFS), Time from first dose of study treatment to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause (whichever occurs first), as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1, From time of first dose until death or the first occurrence of disease progression whichever occurs first, assessed up to approximately 48 months|Overall Survival (OS), The length of time from date of first study treatment to death of any cause, From time of first dose until death from any cause, assessed up to approximately 48 months|Objective Response Rate, Percent of patients who have either complete or partial response by CT/MRI imaging based on RECIST v1.1 criteria, From time of first dose until time of best (maximal) response, assessed up to approximately 48 months|Incidence of adverse events, Incidence of adverse events related to study treatment using CTCAE 5.0, From time of first dose until 90 days following the end of treatment, initiation of new systemic anti-cancer therapy, or death (whichever occurs first), assessed up to approximately 48 months
Tissue and blood based biomarkers, Identify tissue or blood based biomarkers that are associated with response to treatment with induction ABCE followed by maintenance AB in ES-SCLC patients with LM, From baseline to approximately 15 months
This is a phase II, open-label, multicenter, single-arm study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab plus atezolizumab plus carboplatin plus etoposide (ABCE) followed by bevacizumab plus atezolizumab (AB) maintenance in Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer patients (ES-SCLC patients) with Liver Metastases (LM) who have received no prior systemic treatment.
