Sequential Targeting of Cluster of Differentiation 52 (CD52) and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) Allows Early Minimization Therapy in Kidney Transplantation
The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of new immunosuppressive protocol based on two applications of anti-CD52 MabCampath (Alemtuzumab) a single dose of anti-TNF-α Remicade (infliximab) monoclonal antibodies in the early posttransplant period followed by either monotherapy based on tacrolimus or sirolimus.
Kidney Transplantation
DRUG: MabCampath,|DRUG: Remicade|DRUG: Sirolimus|DRUG: Tacrolimus
Number of Patients Alive, 1 year|Number of Patients With Functional Graft, 1 year
Kidney Graft Function (Measured by Serum Creatinine), Kidney graft function is measured as serum creatinine in umol/l at 1 year after transplantation. Higher levels of creatinine represents worse graft function., 1 year|Number of Bioptically Verified Rejection Episodes, We calculated the number of participants with biopsy-proven subclinical rejection (based on Banff classification) within 1 year post-transplantation., 1 year|Presence of Subclinical Rejection in Protocol Biopsy at 12 Months (Based on Histological Examination Using Banff Classification), 1 year
