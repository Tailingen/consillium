Adjuvant Treatment Determined By Pathological Response To Neoadjvuant Nivolumab
Subjects with resectable melanoma will receive neoadjuvant nivolumab followed by surgical resection. Post-operatively, subjects will receive open-label treatment with up to 1 year of adjuvant nivolumab or ipilimumab plus nivolumab as determined by pathologic response at the time of resection.
Melanoma Stage III|Melanoma
DRUG: nivolumab|DRUG: Ipilimumab
Recurrence-Free Survival, Recurrence-free survival (RFS) is defined as the time from date of surgery to date of disease recurrence, death due to any cause or most recent follow-up documenting freedom from recurrence (i.e., scan date)., 1 year
Frequency and Incidence of Adverse Events, Toxicity will be determined by scoring treatment-related AEs and SAEs. CTCAE version 5.0 grades will be employed., Up to 13 months|Pathological Response Rate, The number of subjects with pathologic complete response (CR) or near CR defined by less than 10% viable tumor cells will be determined for subjects who received 1 dose of neoadjuvant Nivolumab and underwent definitive surgery. PathCR/nearCR rate is defined as the percentage of treated subjects who achieve PathCR/nearCR, Approximately 4 weeks|Overall Survival, Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from date of surgery to date of death due to any cause or last subject contact alive., Up to 7 Years
Subjects with Stage III resectable melanoma will receive one dose of nivolumab 480 mg IV, then undergo standard definitive surgery approximately 4 weeks after the initial dose of nivolumab. Post-operatively, subjects will receive open-label treatment with up to 1 year of adjuvant nivolumab 480 mg IV every 4 weeks or ipilimumab plus nivolumab, as determined by pathologic response at the time of resection. Subjects with pathologic complete response or near pathologic complete response (PathCR/nearCR) (Arm A) receive adjuvant nivolumab for up to one year. Subjects with \<PathCR/nearCR are randomized 1:2 to either adjuvant nivolumab (480 mg) for up to one year (Arm B) or adjuvant ipilimumab (1mg/kg) plus nivolumab (3mg/kg) for 4 doses and then nivolumab (480 mg) alone for a total of one year (Arm C).
