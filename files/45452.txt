BEHAVIORAL: Inspiratory Muscle Training-Rehabilitation|OTHER: Questionnaires
Postoperative Pneumonia, To prospectively determine the effect of a customized preoperative inspiratory muscle training (IMT) and brief pulmonary rehabilitation program on the incidence of postoperative pneumonia in patients that undergo an esophageal surgical resection. The investigators will consider the following as pneumonia: new infiltrate + either fever (\>38.5 C) and white cell count \>11,000 or fever and purulent secretions., 3 months
Postoperative Pulmonary Complications, To prospectively determine the effect of a customized preoperative inspiratory muscle training (IMT) and brief pulmonary rehabilitation program on the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications in patients that undergo an esophageal surgical resection.The investigators will consider the following events as post-operative pulmonary complications: severe atelectasis (requiring bronchoscopy) and respiratory failure (intubation or prolonged mechanical ventilation (\>24hours)., 3 months
Length of Hospital Stay, Length of hospital stay will be measured by participant monitoring while hospitalized until hospital discharge., 3 months|Quality of Life, Quality of life will be assessed at baseline and at 3 months after hospital discharge by participant completion of the PROMIS Global 10., Baseline to 3 months
To obtain definitive evidence for the effectiveness of a short preoperative inspiratory muscle training (IMT) protocol on the morbidity and recovery from an esophageal surgical resection.
