Cardiovascular Risk and Preventive Care in Prostate Cancer Patients Receiving Radiation and Hormone Therapy
This study will evaluate the proportion of prostate cancer patients receiving external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with controlled blood sugars (fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1c), blood pressure, and cholesterol profile (total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides) at baseline, 3 months, and 12 months after completing radiation treatment. In addition, receipt of guideline-recommended cardiovascular, primary and preventive care as well as patient-reported quality of life and satisfaction with care among these patients will be evaluated at baseline and 12 months.
