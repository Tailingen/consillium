Organoid-driven Chemotherapy Choice in Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer Patients.
Pancreatic cancer is burdened by an extremely low survival rate. Survival chances reduce even further when the tumor spreads to other organs such as lymphnodes, liver or lungs. When the tumor cannot be surgically resected, the only valid curative option is represented by chemotherapy. However, therapies available to date have limited efficacy and they do not specifically target the biological characteristics of the tumor. The aim of the project is to validate a new technology called \&amp;#34;patient-derived organoids\&amp;#34; (PDOs) in predicting the best drugs for the treatment of pancreatic cancer based on the tumoral characteristics and behavior.

In order to generate PDOs a sample of tumoral tissue will be collected during a small surgical procedure, called laparoscopy. PDOs represent mini, three-dimensional copies of the original tumor, of which they maintain its behavior and aggressiveness. Through the DNA and RNA analysis of the tumor, the aim is to predict the best available drug by screening thousands of potentially effective compounds. Once identified, drugs will be tested in vitro on PDOs and the most efficient drug in controlling the tumor will be administered to the patient, once the present standard-of-care treatments fail.

Multiple benefits are expected from this trial. First of all, the most effective drug against their tumor based on an objective in vitro response will be provided. This might reflect in a better control of the disease and in a longer survival. Targeting the chemotherapy will also imply less side-effects due to unnecessary elevated chemotherapeutic dosages, which in turn will lead to a better compliance with the therapy. Eventually, all these aspects will reflect into a better quality of life.

Organoid sensitivity to first-line regimens ad progression-free survival, To demonstrate a significant correlation between the degree of sensitivity predicted by PDOs to Gemcitabine-Abraxane, or Abraxane-Gemcitabine-FOLFOX (according to the SEQUENCE trial) or FOLFIRINOX (according to the NAPOLI-3 trial), and clinical progression free survival (PFS) in metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma., From enrollment to disease progression according to the RECIST v1.1 criteria, assessed up to 100 months
