TreatmENT of AnastomotiC LeakagE After COLON Cancer Resection
This international multicentre retrospective cohort study aims to research anastomotic leakage after colon cancer resection and has two main objectives:

1. To identify predictive factors associated with 90-day mortality and 90-day Clavien-Dindo grade 4-5 complications amongst patients who developed AL following colon cancer resection and to develop and validate a prediction model for predicting 90-day mortality as well as the co-primary composite endpoint Clavien-Dindo grade 4-5 complications.
2. To explore and compare the effectiveness of various treatment strategies for AL following colon cancer resection, considering patient, tumour, resection and leakage characteristics.

OTHER: Development of a model for predicting 90-day mortality and to compare various treatment strategies for anastomotic leakage
90-day mortality, mortality correlated with anastomotic leakage, 90 days after colon cancer resection|90-day Clavien-Dindo grade IV - V complications, This composite co-primary outcome consists of single-organ failure (i.e. grade IV) and mortality (i.e. grade V), 90 days after colon cancer resection
Time from colon cancer resection to diagnosis of anastomotic leakage, at least one year follow up|Time from colon cancer resection to primary treatment of anastomotic leakage, at least one year follow up|Length of hospital/intensive care unit stay, at least one year follow up|Mortality, 30-day, 90-day and one-year after colon cancer resection|Stoma presence (and if so, type of stoma), At least one year after colon cancer resection, preferably last date of follow up|Disease status, At least one year after colon cancer resection, preferably at last date of follow up|Number of radiologic and surgical reinterventions, One year after colon cancer resection
