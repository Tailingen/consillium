A Study of Famitinib in Patients With Advanced Colorectal Cancer
Famitinib is a tyrosin-inhibitor agent targeting at c-Kit, VEGFR2, PDGFR, VEGFR3, Flt1 and Flt3, and it's anti-angiogenesis effect has been viewed in preclinical tests. Phase I study has shown that the toxicity is manageable.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether Famitinib can improve progression free survival compared with placebo in patients with advanced colorectal cancer who failed in previous at least two lines of chemotherapy.
