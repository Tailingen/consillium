Safety and Pharmacokinetics Study of YYB101 in Advanced Solid Tumors Patients Who Are Refractory to Standard Therapy
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of YYB101, HGF-neutralizing humanized Mab, in advanced solid tumors patients who are refractory to standard therapy.

To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of YYB101, patients who are refractory to standard therapy will be enrolled in this study. In dose-escalation cohort, subjects will be enrolled sequentially into four dose cohorts receiving a single dose of YYB101 (0.3, 1, 3, or 5 mg/kg; 3 or 6 subjects per dose cohort) and will be entered the 4-week treatment-free period to evaluate safety and pharmacokinetics. If no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed during the 4-week period, YYB101 administration will be resumed at the same dose level every 2 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity development. After the completion of the dose-escalation cohort, additional subjects will be enrolled into a dose-expansion cohort at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for further exploration of safety, tolerability, efficacy and pharmacodynamics.
