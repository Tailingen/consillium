ATALANTE: Atezolizumab vs Placebo Phase III Study in Late Relapse Ovarian Cancer Treated With Chemotherapy+Bevacizumab
This is a phase III, randomized, double-blinded, comparative, multi-centre study to assess the efficacy of atezolizumab in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy plus bevacizumab administered concurrent to chemotherapy and in maintenance, in patients presenting epithelial ovarian cancer (including patients with primary peritoneal and / or fallopian tube adenocarcinoma) who have platinum-sensitive relapse (platinum-free interval \> 6 months).
Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: atezolizumab + avastin + platinum-based chemotherapy|DRUG: placebo + avastin + platinum-based chemotherapy
Efficacy: Progression free survival, where the date of progression is based on investigator assessment using the RECIST version 1.1, An average of 19 months
Efficacy: Overall survival (OS), To be assessed around 73 months|Efficacy: Time from date randomization to second subsequent therapy or date of death (TSST) whichever come first, To be assessed around 73 months|patient reported outcome variables, questionnaire to be completed by patients and collected frequently during the study, to be assessed 19 months|Adverse events, frequency of adverse events according to MedRA terms, to be assessed 19 months
Approximately 600 patients will be randomized using an Interactive Voice Response System /Interactive web system (IVR/IWR system) in a 1:2 ratio to the treatments as specified below:

A. Arm A: Placebo + bevacizumab \& platinum-based chemotherapy.

The placebo arm will include one of 3 following regimens up to investigator choice (chosen prior to randomization)

1. Carboplatin (day1)combined with gemcitabine (day1 \& day8) and bevacizumab (day1) + placebo ( day1) x 6 cycles q3weeks followed by maintenance with bevacizumab ( day1) + placebo (day1) q3weeks until disease progression or
2. Carboplatin (d1) combined with paclitaxel (day1) and bevacizumab (day1) + placebo (d1) x 6 cycles every 3weeks followed by maintenance with bevacizumab (day1) + placebo (day1) q3weeks until disease progression or
3. Carboplatin (day1) combined with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) (day1) and bevacizumab (day1 \& 15) + placebo ( day1\& 15) x 6 cycles every 4weeks followed by maintenance with bevacizumab (day1) + placebo (day1) q3weeks until disease progression.

B. Arm B: Atezolizumab + bevacizumab \& platinum-based chemotherapy

The atezolizumab arm will include one of 3 following regimens up to investigator choice (chosen prior to randomization)

1. Carboplatin (day1) combined with gemcitabine (day1 \& d8) and bevacizumab (day1) + atezolizumab ( day1) x 6 cycles q3weeks followed by maintenance with bevacizumab (day1) + atezolizumab (day1) q3w until disease progression or
2. Carboplatin (day1) combined with paclitaxel (day1) and bevacizumab ( day1) + atezolizumab (1200mg, d1) x 6 cycles every 3wk (day1) q3weeks until disease progression or
3. Carboplatin (day1) combined with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) (day1) and bevacizumab (day1 \& 15) + atezolizumab (day1\& 15) x 6 cycles every 4weeks followed by maintenance with bevacizumab (day1) + atezolizumab ( day1) q3weeks until disease progression.

Before randomization to the study:

* A tumor biopsy should have been obtained and sent to the central laboratory
* PD-L1 status should be determined
