Neoadjuvant Dupilumab in Men With Localized High-Risk Prostate Cancer
This is a single-center, single arm, open-label phase II study evaluating the safety, anti-tumor effect, and immunogenicity of neoadjuvant Dupixent given prior to radical prostatectomy.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Dupilumab
Change in M2-TAM Infiltration From Baseline, Change in M2-TAM infiltration (number of macrophages / cell nuclei per high power field \[hpf\]) measured in pre- dupilumab biopsy to M2-TAM infiltration measured in post-dupilumab specimen collected at time of radical prostatectomy (up to 59 days post-intervention). Degree of TAM infiltration will be analyzed using immunohistochemical staining for CD206. It is hypothesized that a positive value will be associated with better outcome and a negative value will reflect a worse outcome., change from baseline to up to 59 days post-intervention
Safety as Assessed by Number of Participants Experiencing Adverse Events, Adverse events defined by NCI Common Toxicity Criteria version 4.0 (NCI CTCAE v4.0), up to 59 days post-intervention|Feasibility as Assessed by Number of Participants Who Have an Average Blood Loss in Excess of 2500 mL During Prostatectomy, up to 59 days post-intervention|Feasibility as Assessed by Number of Participants With Average Prostatectomy Operative Time in Excess of 3.5 Hours, up to 59 days post-intervention|Feasibility as Assessed by Number of Participants With Average Hospital Stay in Excess of 4 Days Post-prostatectomy, up to 59 days post-intervention|CD8+ T-cell Infiltration in Post-treatment Prostate Glands, mean CD4+ T-cell staining percentage and CD4+/Treg ratio in harvested tumor tissue collected from prostatectomy specimen, up to 59 days post-intervention|CD4+ T-cell and Treg Infiltration in Post-treatment Prostate Glands, mean CD4+ T-cell staining percentage and CD4+/Treg ratio in harvested tumor tissue collected from prostatectomy specimen, up to 59 days post-intervention|Expression of Apoptosis Marker (Annexin V) in Post-treatment Prostate Tumor Specimen as Measured by Mean Staining Percentage in Tumor Tissue, Mean staining percentage of Annexin V in tumor tissue, using TUNEL (Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling) staining., up to 59 days post-intervention|Expression of Cell Proliferation in Post-treatment Prostate Tumor Specimen as Measured by Mean Staining Percentage of Ki-67 in Tumor Tissue, up to 59 days post-intervention|Proportion of Participants With Pathological Complete Response, Pathological response is defined as the absence of tumor identification by study pathologist on standard histological analysis of resected prostate specimens., 1 month post-prostatectomy|Proportion of Participants Who Achieve an Undetectable PSA at 2 Months Post-prostatectomy, Proportion of participants with PSA \<0.1ng/mL by 2 months after prostatectomy, 2 months post-prostatectomy
This is a single-center, single arm, open-label phase II study evaluating the safety, anti-tumor effect, and immunogenicity of neoadjuvant Dupixent given prior to radical prostatectomy in men with high-risk localized prostate cancer (this trial will enroll men with at least high risk prostate cancer defined by NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2017 = clinical stage ≥T3a or PSA \>20 ng/mL or Gleason score ≥8).

Patients will be recruited from the outpatient Urology clinic. Men will be treated with dupilumab 600 mg subcutaneously (SQ) on day 1, and then 300 mg SQ on days 8,15, 22, 29, 36, 43. They will then undergo surgery on day 57. 14 days after the last dose of Dupixent, prostate glands will be harvested at the time of radical prostatectomy, and prostate tissue will be examined for the secondary endpoints.

Follow-up evaluation for adverse events will occur 30 days and 60 days after surgery. Patients will then be followed by their urologists according to standard institutional practices, but will require PSA evaluations every 3 (±1) months during year 1 and every 6 (±2) months during years 2-3.
