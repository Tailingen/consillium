Long Term Follow-up of Persistent Pain, Sensory Disturbances and Lymphedema After Breast Cancer Treatment
Persistent pain, sensory disturbances, lymphedema and functional impairment are frequently occurring late effects of breast cancer treatment. The investigators have previously published data on 3253 women treated for breast cancer in Denmark in the period 2005-2006. Very few studies have examined how these late effects change in time. The aim of this study is to examine in a well defined patient population any change in the prevalence of persistent pain, sensory disturbances, lymphedema and functional impairment, as well as risk factor profile.
Breast Cancer|Pain|Post Operative Pain|Lymphedema|Neuropathy
Prevalence of persistent pain, Prevalence of pain in the breast area, axilla, side of chest or arm, as a yes/no variable, 6-7 years post operative|Prevalence of patients changing pain status from the 2008 survey, 6-7 years
Prevalence of sensory disturbance, 6-7 years|Prevalence of self reported lymphedma, 6-7 years|Prevalence of functional impairment, 6-7 years|Risk factors associated for persistent pain, sensory disturbances, lymphedema or functional impairment, 6-7 years|Prevalence of patients changing status of sensory disturbances and self reported lymphedma, 6-7 years|Risk factors associated to changing status of sensory disturbances and lymphedema, 6-7 years post operative
