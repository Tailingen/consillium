Observational Study of Correlation Between Recurrent Basal Cell Carcinoma and Localisation
.During one year all the resected basal cell carcinomas (BCC) analyzed in Montpellier University Hospital Anatomopathology unit were included in this study. Localisation and histological characteristics were collected. All the recurrences of BCC were searched from the medical records (or histopathology request form).

From 804 BCC, 48 were recurrent BCC with or without complete first resection. Patients with recurrent BCC were contacted to obtain agreement and more informations about the first resection and some clinical informations like sun exposure and phototype.

The statistical analysis focused on the localisation of recurrent BCC (with a complete first resection) compared to localisations of primary BCC in this population. The goal was to identified localisations with an increased risk of recurrences.
