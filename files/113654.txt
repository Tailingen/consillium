3-arm Study of Abiraterone Acetate Alone, Abiraterone Acetate Plus Degarelix, a GnRH Antagonist, and Degarelix Alone for Patients With Prostate Cancer With a Rising PSA or a Rising PSA and Nodal Disease Following Definitive Radical Prostatectomy
In April 2011, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the oral drug abiraterone acetate (Zytiga ®) in combination with prednisone (a steroid) to treat patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who have received prior docetaxel (chemotherapy). In December 2012, the FDA approved Zytiga ® in combination with prednisone to treat patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who have not received prior chemotherapy. Degarelix (Firmagon ®), a testosterone lowering agent given as a monthly injection, is FDA approved for the treatment of patients with advanced prostate cancer. The purpose of this study is to evaluate abiraterone acetate and prednisone in combination with degarelix as a possible treatment for PSA recurrent prostate cancer as compared to abiraterone acetate alone and degarelix alone. This will be the first time these drugs will be used together.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Abiraterone acetate|DRUG: Abiraterone acetate plus degarelix|DRUG: Degarelix
Progression-free Survival (PFS), defined as an undetectable PSA (using a routine non-ultrasensitive PSA assay) with non-castrate level of testosterone (\>150 ng/dL) at 18 months from the time of treatment initiation (PSA0)., 18 months|Soft Tissue Complete Response, In addition to an undetectable PSA, any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm (Complete Response per RECIST) in order to meet the criteria for PFS. Outcome in subjects who develop radiographically evident metastatic disease while on study will be considered treatment failures independent of their respective PSA values., 1 year
PSA Response Rate, The percentage of patients with a non-castrate level of testosterone (\>150 ng/dL) and an undetectable PSA at 8 months from PSA0 will be measured., 8 months|Overall Quality of Life, with particular attention to libido, potency, anxiety, depression, hot flashes, and fatigue. Effects of each arm on health-related quality of life will be assessed via PRO Survey (Appendix C) completed on paper by the patient at the following study visits: Up to 30 Days Prior to Randomization, each Day 1 of Treatment Cycle, End of Treatment, and each Post-Treatment Follow-up.Effects of each arm on quality of life,, 1 year|Non-hematologic Adverse Events, Safety will be evaluated according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0. Safety assessments will be based on medical review of adverse event reports and the results of vital sign measurements, physical examinations and clinical laboratory tests throughout the conduct of the study., 1 year|Testosterone and Luteinizing Hormone (LH) Recovery Rates, Testosterone and LH recovery rates will be measured at 8 months from the start of randomization and at each month of the 10 month follow up period., 8 -10 months|Correlative Tissue Analysis, Tissue samples will be utilized for morphologic assessment, percent tumor involvement (if applicable), and immunohistochemistry. The immunohistochemical markers assessed may be AR, PTEN, PSMA, fatty acid synthase (FASN), phospho-AMPK, phospho-ACC, phospho-S6 kinase, phospho-Akt for the assessment of the AMPK, lipid synthesis, mTOR pathways, and immunological markers., 1 year
