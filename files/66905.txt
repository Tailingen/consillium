PRE- MISTIC: MRI and Cine Imaging to Improve Staging of Tumors in the Colon
At this moment, we use CT and endoscopy to clinically stage colon tumours. Unfortunately, the combination of these imaging techniques is highly inaccurate. 40% of advanced pathological colon tumours (so called T4 tumours) are not staged as a T4 tumour pre-operatively. Preoperative or neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has improved outcomes in other gastrointestinal cancers and seems to be a promising pretreatment for colon tumours. To implement NACin colon tumours, we first need to stage the colon tumours with much higher accuracy. MRI sequences and cine imaging hold promise to provide more accurate staging of colon tumours.
