High-flow Nasal Oxygen During Rigid Bronchoscopy Under General Anesthesia: a Randomized Controlled Trial
The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of high-flow nasal cannula oxygen administration on apnea in patients undergoing general anesthesia with rigid bronchoscopy compared with standard anesthesia methods.
