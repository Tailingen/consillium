Breast Cancer Treatment Based on Organ-like Culture
Based on the breast cancer organ platform, this experiment establishes a drug sensitivity test method that is closer to the body tumor in breast cancer, provides a basis for the accurate treatment of breast cancer, and discusses the possible mechanism of breast cancer drug resistance.

Detection of cell viability, 1. The organ-like organ was assayed for cell viability using CellTiter Glo 3D reagent, and the curve was used to obtain a half-inhibitory concentration range. The dose was adjusted according to the half-inhibition concentration range to obtain an accurate half-inhibitory concentration., 8 weeks before neoadjuvant chemotherapy
Detection of in vitro model drug sensitivity, 2. In vitro model drug sensitivity: sensitive and insensitive, 8 weeks before neoadjuvant chemotherapy|Clinical efficacy assessment according to RECIST criteria, Clinical efficacy evaluation according to RECIST criteria: imaging ultrasonography, histological pathology., 8 weeks before neoadjuvant chemotherapy
