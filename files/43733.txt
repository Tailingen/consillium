BCMA/CD3 BiTE for RRAL or NDAL Amyloidosis With Insufficient Depth of Hematologic Response After Induction Therapy
The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of CM-336, which is a BCMA/CD3 BiTE, in patients with relapsed/refractory AL amyloidosis or newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis with insufficient depth of hematologic response after induction therapy.

The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of CM-336, which is a BCMA/CD3 BiTE, in patients with relapsed/refractory AL amyloidosis or newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis with insufficient depth of hematologic response after induction therapy.

Patients received subcutaneous CM-336 80 mg once weekly in 28-d cycles after two step-up priming doses of 3 mg and 20 mg given on day 1 and day 4 of cycle 1. For patients achieve hematological PR or better after 2 cycles, and hematological VGPR or better after 4 cycles, the treatment regimen will change to 160mg once every 2 weeks (Q2W).
