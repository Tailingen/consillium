Randomized Trial of Restrictive Versus Liberal Perioperative Fluid Management for Patients Undergoing Pancreatic Resection
The purpose of this study is to help us learn what the best amount of fluid is that patients should receive during pancreas surgery. Patients will receive either the liberal fluid amount for this surgery or a restricted fluid amount.

Both amounts of fluid have been used safely in patients having similar surgeries. These amounts have not been compared in pancreatic surgery. The fluids regimens that will be given are not experimental.

This study will compare patients in the liberal and restricted fluid groups in terms of the nature of any surgical complications (problems)and recovery from surgery, including length of hospital stay.

To determine if restrictive perioperative fluid management results in fewer complications, morbidity and decreased length of stay in patients undergoing pancreatic resection, compared to liberal fluid management., 3 years
Determine if restrictive perioperative fluid management, comp to liberal periop fluid management, decreases delayed gastric emptying, length of stay (LOS) & the incidence of other, less frequent morbidity in adult patients getting pancreatic resection., 3 years
