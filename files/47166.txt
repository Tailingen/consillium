Patients with rectal cancer are assigned to receive preoperative 5 Ã— 5 Gy irradiation over 5 days with total neoadjuvant chemotherapy and camrelizumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody drug. The Primary Objective is to assess clinical complete response of an organ preservation approach and the secondary objective to assess safety in all enrolled patients, local regrowth rate and other cancer specific outcomes (metastasis-free survival, colostomy-free survival and overall survival), longitudinal health-related quality of life of this organ preservation approach.
