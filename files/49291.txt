Autologous OC-DC Vaccine in Ovarian Cancer
This is a Five cohort sequential clinical trial for subjects with recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer to determine the feasibility and safety as well as immunogenicity of OC-DC, an autologous vaccine comprised of autologous dendritic cells (DC) loaded in vitro with lysate from autologous oxidized tumor cells, administered intranodally alone, or in combination with intravenous Bevacizumab and cyclophosphamide or in combination with intravenous Bevacizumab, cyclophosphamide and aspirin. Study duration is 24 months.

Safety, Safety will be established by grading the observed toxicities using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC Version3.0). All toxicities observed within 30 days of last vaccination will be included., 30 days of last vaccination
Clinical Response, Clinical Response will be determined by RECIST criteria. Response rate is the proportion of patients that achieve CR or PR.|Dose limiting toxicity, Dose-limiting toxicity is defined as: any Grade 3 or higher allergic, autoimmune or injection site reaction or any Grade 4 hematologic or non-hematologic toxicity (except fever).|Immune Response Immune Response, Immune response will be evaluated by IFN-g ELISPOT analysis of tumor-reactive T cells, and in HLAA2+ subjects, by tetramer analysis of Her-2 specific T cells in peripheral blood. Response is defined by a 3 fold increase relative to pre-vaccination.
