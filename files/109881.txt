A Trial of Androgen Deprivation, Docetaxel, and Enzalutamide for Metastatic Prostate Cancer
This is a study with the combination of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and docetaxel with the addition of enzalutamide in the treatment of subjects with metastatic prostate cancer. The purpose of this study is to assess if ADT + docetaxel + enzalutamide is well tolerated and demonstrates improved efficacy compared to ADT + docetaxel.

52-week PSA Complete Response (CR) Rate, The 52-week PSA CR rate was defined as the proportion of participants achieving PSA complete response (CR) at 52-weeks (+/- 1 week) from date of enrollment (i.e., initiation of both enzalutamide and docetaxel) of all evaluable participants. PSA CR was defined as PSA level less than 0.2 ng/ml for two consecutive measurements at least three weeks apart (date of initial PSA level 0.2 ng/ml was acknowledged as date of response). In subjects with missed PSA assessments at 52 (+/- 1) weeks, (a) if a confirmed CR was achieved and at least one PSA assessment occurred beyond the 52-week window showed serologic complete response (providing the subject did not earlier experience confirmed progressive disease), the subject achieved 52-week PSA Complete Response and (b) if confirmed CR was achieved before the 52-week window and the first assessment after the 52-week window was not a CR, the subject did not achieve a 52-week PSA Complete Response., 52 weeks

This is a single center, single arm, phase II trial designed to evaluate the 12 month PSA complete response rate in patients with metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer treated with ADT, docetaxel and enzalutamide. The primary endpoint of this study will be 12-month PSA complete response rate, which will be assessed against a contemporary historical control rate for the combination of ADT and docetaxel alone in the metastatic hormone naive setting. The study will be conducted at all participating sites across North and South Carolina within the Levine Cancer Institute network. Enrollment is anticipated to be completed within 24 months.
