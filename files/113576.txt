Precision Pain Management for Major Abdominal Surgery in Colorectal Surgery
The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the potential for preoperative pharmacogenomics (PGx) testing to positively influence postoperative opioid use through visual analog scale (VAS) guided administration of narcotic equivalent and lower pain scores as measured by OBAS in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery.
