Testing Spectrosense EVA System for Detection of Breast Cancer by Analyzing Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) in Exhaled Air
Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) in human breath are captured and analyzed by the Spectrosense EVA system, which is combination of a gas chromatography (GC) and software algorithm. The objective is to obtain a set or sets of VOC bio-markers that will provide the best discrimination between Breast Cancer sick population and healthy population. The gold standard for identifying sick/healthy population is biopsy proven breast cancer.
