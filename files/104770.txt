Radiogenomics of Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer
Patients with suspected bladder tumor will undergo novel 4D MRI imaging along with single cell RNA sequencing in hopes of identifying a radiogenomic signature that can improve our staging of patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer.

The study will accrue patients with sessile appearing bladder masses who are destined to undergo transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) and are felt by the treating physician to harbor MIBC. Prior to TURBT, ALL subjects will undergo axial imaging for clinical staging in the form of contrast enhanced MRI of the abdomen and pelvis (standard of care). The pelvic MRI will be multiparametric (mp)-4D MRI incorporating high resolution diffusion weighted imaging (HR-DWI). Both the abdominal and pelvic MRI will have an official intrepretation by a radiologist, thus both can be used in the care of the subject. Next, ALL subjects will undergo TURBT at which time fresh frozen bladder tumor will be collected and subjected to single cell RNA sequencing. Pathologic stage will be determined and reported on both the TURBT specimen and radical cystectomy specimen. From the above radiogenomic data, the investigators will show feasibility, which the investigators will define as know-how to create a radiogenomic workflow and to learn about the correlation structure between the radiomic and genomic parameters of interest, which will allow the investigators to design future studies with adequate power.
