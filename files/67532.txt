Phase II Trial of the Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor PD 0332991 in Patients With Cancer
RATIONALE: PD 0332991 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well PD 0332991 works in treating patients with refractory solid tumors.

DRUG: PD-0332991
Response Rates, Response rates will be measured using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST):

Complete Response (CR) - Disappearance of all target lesions Partial Response (PR) - ≥30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of the target lesions compared with baseline Progressive Disease (PD) - ≥20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of the target lesions compared with the smallest sum of the longest diameter recorded since treatment started OR The appearance of 1 or more new lesions Stable Disease (SD) - Neither PR or PD Not Evaluable (NE), 10 years
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the response rates following treatment with PD 0332991 in the following malignancies: 1) Metastatic breast cancer, 2) Metastatic colorectal cancer, 3) Metastatic melanoma with CDK4 mutation or amplification, or 4) Cisplatin-refractory, unresectable germ cell tumors.

OUTLINE:

Patients receive oral PD 0332991 once daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.
