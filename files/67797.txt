Implementation and Effectiveness of the BJC-Pink and Pearl Project on Lung Cancer Screening
The investigators proposal is ripe for executing as the investigators seek to leverage this "natural experiment" initiated by the BJC health system to evaluate the effectiveness of the Pink \& Pearl Campaign as an implementation strategy to promote lung cancer screening (LCS) uptake among LCS-eligible women undergoing mammography at BJC West County. This evaluation is grounded in the Integrated Screening Action Model that depicts individual- and environmental-level influences on the screening behavior process. Using an explanatory sequential mixed methods design, which combines both quantitative and qualitative approaches, the research questions and specific aims for this proposal are to: a) evaluate the baseline prevalence of LCS among LCS-eligible women; b) assess whether the Pink \& Pearl Campaign increases referrals and uptake/ completion of LCS among LCS-eligible women undergoing screening mammography; and c) evaluate individual and environmental factors influencing LCS uptake, and implementation outcomes of the campaign. These implementation outcomes will help identify whether the campaign was put in place successfully or not. This proposal will inform strategies for integrating cancer screening programs to improve poorly performing programs like LCS.
