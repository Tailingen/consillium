Cytokine Profiles in Breast Cancer Patients Undergoing Chemotherapy
Aim: This study evaluated the effects of non-surgical periodontal therapy (NSPT) on the cytokine profile and the correlation to clinical parameters of patients undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer.

Materials and methods: 40 patients were allocated: periodontitis patients (P) (n=20) and breast cancer with periodontitis patients (CAN/P) (n=20). The clinical parameters: probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), plaque index (PI), Bleeding on probing (BOP) and levels of IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-10, TGF-β, IL-17, IL-2, IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) were evaluated at baseline, 45 and 180 days after therapy.

The NSPT, which consisted of subgingival debridement - scaling and root planning (SRP) under local anesthesia. On average, the treatment of the entire oral cavity was completed within four sessions (sessions of 50 minutes). The SRP was performed by one experienced periodontist (KRVV) using Gracey curettes (Hu-Friedy MFG. Co. Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), ultra-sonic devices (Bob-Cat, Dentsply/Cavitron, Long Island City, NY, USA) and, if necessary, with multilaminated drills.
