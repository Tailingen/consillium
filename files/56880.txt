Phase Ib Study to Assess Safety and Preliminary Efficacy of Tafasitamab or Tafasitamab Plus Lenalidomide in Addition to R-CHOP in Patients With Newly Diagnosed DLBCL
This is an open-label, randomized, multicentre study to evaluate safety and preliminary efficacy of the human anti-CD19 antibody Tafasitamab in addition to R-CHOP (Rituximab, Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine, Prednisone) or Tafasitamab and Lenalidomide in addition to R-CHOP in adult patients with newly diagnosed, previously untreated Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL).
Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Tafasitamab|DRUG: Tafasitamab plus lenalidomide
Incidence and Severity of Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), 6 months approximately
Objective Response Rate (ORR) at the End of Treatment (EOT), The ORR at EOT was defined as the proportion of patients with Complete Response (CR) or Partial response (PR) based on the response achieved at the EOT Visit/early treatment discontinuation visit., 6 months approximately|Metabolic, PET-negative Complete Response (CR) Rate at the End of Treatment, 6 months approximately|Incidence and Severity of Adverse Events (AEs) in the Follow-up (FU) Period, 18 months for non-treatment emergent adverse events, 6 months for treatment emergent adverse events|Best Objective Response Rate (ORR) Until the End of Study (EOS), The best ORR was defined as the proportion of patients with Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) as the best response until the EOS., 24 months approximately|Metabolic, PET-negative Complete Response (CR) Rate Until the End of Study, 24 months approximately|Progression-free Survival (PFS) at 12 and 24 Months, As many patients had their data censored, due to completing the study without disease progression or death due to any cause, the probability of PFS (%) was used., 24 months approximately|Event-free Survival (EFS) at 12 and 24 Months, As many patients had their data censored, due to completing the study without disease progression, death due to any cause, or the start of a new anti-lymphoma treatment, the probability of EFS (%) was used., 24 months approximately|Time to Next Anti-lymphoma Treatment (TTNT), As many patients had their data censored, due to completing the study without needing to receive another anti-lymphoma treatment, the Probability of TTNT (%) was used. Time to next anti-lymphoma treatment survival % estimate was the estimated probability that a patient remained TTNT-free up to the specified point in time., 24 months approximately|Overall Survival at 12 and 24 Months, As many patients had their data censored, due to completing the study without death from any cause, the probability of OS (%) was used., 24 months approximately|Anti-tafasitamab Antibodies Formation, 12 months approximately
