Progression Free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by Investigator per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), PFS is defined as time from date of randomization until the date of first objective progressive disease (PD) by investigator assessment according to RECIST v1.1 or death from any cause, whichever comes first., Until progression or death, up to approximately 60 months
Objective Response Rate (ORR) as Assessed by Investigator per RECIST Version 1.1, ORR is defined as the proportion of participants who achieve a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) that is confirmed at least 4 weeks after initial documentation of response., Until progression, up to approximately 60 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization until the date of death from any cause., Until death, up to approximately 60 months
1. Study Population

   - Eligible Participants: Patients with triple - negative metastatic breast cancer at the second line of treatment or higher. Triple - negative invasive breast cancer is histologically confirmed, defined as immunohistochemical detection revealing estrogen receptor (ER) \< 10%, progesterone receptor (PR) \< 10%, and HER2 0 - 1+ or HER2 2+ with negative fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) results, in accordance with the 2018 ASCO - CAP HER2 - negative identification guidelines.
2. Experimental Design

   - Study Type: Multicenter, prospective cohort study.
3. Sample Size Determination

   * The sample size is calculated based on the primary endpoint of progression - free survival (PFS). Drawing on data from ASCENT (a confirmatory phase III study on the efficacy in triple - negative breast cancer) and EVER - 132 - 001 (a Chinese population bridging study presented at the ESMO Congress), the PFS of sacituzumab govitecan monotherapy in metastatic triple - negative breast cancer (mTNBC) is approximately 5.6 months.
   * Assuming a hazard ratio of 0.70 in each cohort (median PFS value of 8 months vs. 5.6 months), to detect a statistically significant difference between the trial group and the sacituzumab govitecan monotherapy control group at a one - sided significance level of 0.05 and a power of 80%, 51 PFS events are required.

   Given an enrollment period of 18 months and a total study duration of 30 months, 69 subjects are needed for each cohort.
4. Dosage Regimens

   * 4.1 Sacituzumab Govitecan Dose and Administration: The recommended dose is 10 mg/kg. It is administered by intravenous infusion on days 1 and 8 of each treatment cycle, with each cycle lasting three weeks.
   * 4.2 Toripalimab Dose and Administration: 240 mg is administered by intravenous infusion on day 1 of each cycle. Each treatment cycle has a duration of three weeks.
   * 4.3 Antiangiogenic Targeted Drugs Options and Dosage: Bevacizumab or Anlotinib can be selected. Treatment is carried out according to the standard dosage for each respective drug.
