A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Trastuzumab Emtansine in Combination With Atezolizumab or Atezolizumab-Placebo in Participants With Human Epidermal Growth Factor-2 (HER2) Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer (BC) Who Received Prior Trastuzumab and Taxane Based Therapy
This Phase II, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter study will investigate the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab emtansine in combination with atezolizumab or atezolizumab-placebo in participants with HER2-positive locally advanced or metastatic BC who have received prior trastuzumab and taxane based therapy, either alone or in combination, and/or who have progressed within 6 months after completing adjuvant therapy.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Atezolizumab|DRUG: Trastuzumab emtansine|OTHER: Placebo
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) as Determined by Investigator's Tumor Assessment Using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 (v1.1), PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurred first, on the basis of investigator assessments. Progression was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions with an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeter (mm) or the appearance of one or more new lesions., Baseline up to approximately 15 months|Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events, An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events., Baseline up to study completion, approximately 40 months
Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause., Baseline up to study completion or death, whichever occurs first, approximately 40 months|Percentage of Participants With Objective Response (OR) as Determined by Investigator's Tumor Assessment Using RECIST v1.1, An OR was defined as a complete or partial response determined on 2 consecutive occasions ≥ 4 weeks apart using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. Complete response was defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must be \< 10 mm on the short axis. Partial response was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum. Participants who had no post-baseline tumor assessment were counted as non-responders., Baseline up to approximately 15 months|Duration of OR as Determined by Investigator's Tumor Assessment Using RECIST v1.1, Duration of OR was defined as the time from the first tumor assessment that was judged to indicate that the patient had an objective response to the time of first documented disease progression using RECIST v1.1 per investigator assessment or death from any cause, whichever occurred first., Baseline up to approximately 15 months|Maximum Serum Concentration (Cmax) of Trastuzumab Emtansine, Average post infusion Trastuzumab Emtansine concentration, Pre-infusion (0 hour [h]), 30 minutes (min) after end of infusion (EOI) (over 90 min) on Day 1 Cycles 1 and 4; pre-infusion (0 h) on Day 1 Cycle 2 (each cycle = 21 days); at any time during study treatment/early discontinuation visit (approx. 40 months)|Cmax of Deacetyl Mercapto 1-Oxopropyl Maytansine (DM1), Average post infusion Deacetyl Mercapto 1-Oxopropyl Maytansine concentration of trastuzumab emtansine infusion, Pre-infusion (0 h) on Day 1 Cycle 1 and 30 min after EOI (over 90 min) on Day 1 Cycles 1 and 4 (each cycle = 21 days)|Cmax of Total Trastuzumab, Pre-infusion (0 h), 30 min after EOI (over 90 min) on Day 1 Cycles 1 and 4; pre-infusion (0 h) on Day 1 Cycle 2 (each cycle = 21 days)|Cmax of Atezolizumab, Average post infusion atezolizumab concentration, Pre-infusion (0 h), 30 min after EOI (over 60 min) on Day 1 Cycles 1 and 4; pre-infusion (0 h) on Day 1 Cycles 2, 3, 8, and every 8 cycles thereafter (each cycle=21 days) up to 120 days after treatment completion/early discontinuation (approx. 40 months)|Percentage of Participants With Anti-therapeutic Antibodies (ATAs) to Atezolizumab, ATAs are antibodies that inactivate the therapeutic effects of Atezolizumab. Patients are considered to be ATA positive if they are ATA negative at baseline but develop an ATA response following study drug administration (treatment-induced ATA response), or if they are ATA positive at baseline and the titer of one or more post-baseline samples is at least 4-fold greater (i.e., ≥ 0.60 titer units) than the titer of the baseline sample (treatment-enhanced ATA response)., Pre-infusion (0 h) on Day 1 Cycles 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and every 8 cycles thereafter (each cycle = 21 days) up to 120 days after treatment completion or early discontinuation (approximately 40 months)|Percentage of Participants With ATAs to Trastuzumab Emtansine, ATAs are antibodies that inactivate the therapeutic effects of Trastuzumab Emtansine. Patients are considered to be ATA positive if they are ATA negative at baseline but develop an ATA response following study drug administration (treatment-induced ATA response), or if they are ATA positive at baseline and the titer of one or more post-baseline samples is at least 4-fold greater (i.e., ≥ 0.60 titer units) than the titer of the baseline sample (treatment-enhanced ATA response)., Pre-infusion (0 h) on Day 1 Cycles 1 and 4 (each cycle = 21 days); and at any time during study treatment/early discontinuation visit (approximately 40 months)
