Genetically Modified Mesenchymal Stem Cell Theraopeutic Against Head and Neck Cancer
The purpose of this research is to evaluate MTD, Safety and efficacy of GX-051 after intratumoral injection in head and neck cancer patience.
Head and Neck Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: GX-051
MTD after GX-051 intratumoral injection, 2 months
Adverse events after GX-051 intratumoral injection, 2 months|Anti-tumor response by RECIST 1.1 on computed tomography, Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) are used to determine objective clinical response. Complete Rresponse (CR) is the disappearance of all target lesions, partial response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the target lesions, progressive disease (PD) is at least a 20% increase in the target lesions or appearance of one or more new lesions, and stable disease (SD) is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD., 2 months|Changes of INF-Î³ and IL-12 levels in blood comparing to the baseline after GX-051 intratumoral injection, unit: pg/ml, 2 months|Changes of immune cell distribution in tumor tissue after GX-051 intratumoral injection, We will analyze immune cells such as CD4+ T cell, CD8+ T cell, NK cell by FACS analysis on day 1(baseline), day 29(end of treatment) and day 57(follow up), 2 months|Evaluation of antibody generation against IL-12 which is active ingredient of GX-051, We will analyze anti-IL-12 antibody in blood by ELISA on the screening visit and the follw up visit. Result will report as existence or absence of the anti-body ., 2 months|Evaluation of long term safety examined by vital sign, physical examination, clinical laboratory tests, CT etc, Safety profile would be examined by vital sign, physical examination, clinical laboratory tests, CT etc, 17 monthes
The primary purpose of the study is to determine MTD(Maximum Tolerable Dose) of GX-051 administered in tumor. The second purpose is to evaluate safety and efficacy of GX-051.
