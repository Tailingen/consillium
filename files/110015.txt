Phase I Study of LBH589 & Erlotinib for Advanced Aerodigestive Tract Cancers
The main purpose of the study is to:

* Determine the safety and tolerability of erlotinib and LBH589B.
* Establish a recommended phase II expansion dosing of LBH589B and erlotinib in patients with advanced aerodigestive tract cancers.
Lung Cancer|Head and Neck Cancer
DRUG: Panobinostat (LBH589)|DRUG: erlotinib
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), Determine safety and tolerability of erlotinib and LBH589B and establish a recommended phase II expansion dosing of LBH589B and erlotinib in patients with advanced aerodigestive tract cancers., 4 Months
Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR: The percentage of patients with advanced or metastatic cancer who have achieved complete response (CR), partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD) to a therapeutic intervention in clinical trials of anticancer agents. CR: is defined as disappearance of all target lesions. PR: is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD. SD: is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD taking as references the smallest sum LD since the treatment started., Up to 48 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS) by Cancer Type, Progressive Disease (PD) is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of LD of target lesions taking as references the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions., Up to 48 months|Overall Survival (OS) by Cancer Type, Overall survival (OS) is the duration from date of randomization to date of death from any cause., Up to 48 months
The main purpose of the study is to:

* Determine the safety and tolerability of erlotinib and LBH589B.
* Establish a recommended phase II expansion dosing of LBH589B and erlotinib in patients with advanced aerodigestive tract cancers.
