Adjuvant Chemotherapy Compared With Observation in Treating Patients With Resected Early Stage Ovarian Epithelial Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells.

PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of adjuvant therapy using platinum-based chemotherapy drugs with no adjuvant therapy in treating patients with early stage invasive ovarian epithelial cancer.
Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: carboplatin|DRUG: cisplatin|DRUG: cyclophosphamide|DRUG: doxorubicin hydrochloride
OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether adjuvant chemotherapy with a platinum-containing regimen (e.g., carboplatin or CAP: cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/cisplatin) prolongs survival in patients with early stage ovarian cancer compared to those receiving no adjuvant treatment.

OUTLINE: Randomized study. Patients are randomized to Arm I or II; treatment should begin within 6 weeks of surgery. Regimens listed in Arm I are recommended, but other platinum-containing regimens are allowed provided the doses at a minimum meet those listed below. Arm I: Single-agent Chemotherapy or 3-Drug Combination Chemotherapy. Carboplatin, CBDCA, NSC-241240; or CAP: Cyclophosphamide, CTX, NSC-26271; Doxorubicin, DOX, NSC-123127; Cisplatin, CDDP, NSC-119875. Arm II: Observation. No adjuvant therapy.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 2,000 patients will be randomized.
