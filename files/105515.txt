Evaluation for the Individualization of Therapy in Adenocarcinomas of the Gastroesophageal Junction
Metabolic and Molecular Response evaluation for the individualization of therapy in adenocarcinomas of the gastroesophageal junction by evaluation of the R0 resection rate for patients with metabolically (ie, according to PET criteria) chemotherapy-resistant locally advanced AEG, who receive an intensified neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (INRCT). Additonal efforts will be done by investigation of molecular and metabolic biomarkers in relation to their predictive and prognostic value by correlating them with histopathologic responses and clinical outcome in an exploratory approach.

Adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and the esophagogastric junction (AEG) are clinically-topographically divided into subtypes I-III according to the Siewert classification and show an increased incidence. Neoadjuvant and/or perioperative chemotherapy or preoperative radiochemotherapy is well established in the management of AEG. However, a significant number of patients do not respond to preoperative chemotherapy, suffering from toxicity and facing a worse outcome due to lower R0 resection rates. Previous results from the MUNICON-1 and MUNICON-2 trials have shown that PET-based therapy individualization can be successfully integrated in neoadjuvant treatment algorithms.

Tumor-free resection edges (R0) constitute the greatest prognostic advantage in terms of overall survival. However, the R0 resection rates for patients who, according to early metabolic response evaluation, have not responded to the chemotherapy, have not been satisfactory, even after conversion to an - albeit moderate - radiochemotherapy in the MUNICON-2 trial. Thus, this patient population (so-called non responders) so far lack a beneficial neoadjuvant therapy modality.

Based on these results, the primary goal of MEMORI study is to evaluate the R0 resection rate for patients with metabolically (ie, according to PET criteria) chemotherapy-resistant locally advanced AEG, who receive an intensified neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (INRCT). Secondary it is planned to investigate molecular and metabolic biomarkers in relation to their predictive and prognostic value by correlating them with histopathologic responses and clinical outcome in an exploratory approach.
