Technology Platform and System Construction of Clinical Evaluation Studies on New Drugs of Hematological Malignancy
Multiple Myeloma (MM) is the second diagnosed malignancy of hematological malignancies. The previous study pointed out that the dosage and course of Bortezomib including the dose of concomitant drugs used to treatment MM patients did not get the preferred treatment program, so we are going to determine the optimal doses and course of Bortezomib through the prospective, multicenter clinical trial and evaluate the efficiency and safety of different program.
