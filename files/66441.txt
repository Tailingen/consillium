Osteosarcoma and Ewing Sarcoma Treatment Response Assessment With Functional MRI Imaging in Children and Young Adults
The purpose of the study was to investigate whether functional MRI imaging (diffusion weighted imaging) is useful for monitoring the therapeutic response of bone sarcomas in children and young adults. All patients will be scanned before, during and after chemotherapy. The findings on MRI will be correlated with histological finding after surgery.

Second purpose : to define apparent diffusion coefficient value of the bone sarcoma.

Third purpose : to try define prognostic factors, to investigate if there is a correlation between early treatment response and outcome.
Ewing Sarcoma|Osteosarcoma
OTHER: MRI
tumor necrosis - therapy response, correlation of MRI findings with clinical findings during chemotherapy correlation of diffusion weighted MRI and histopathology results after surgical resection.

Calculation of apparent diffusion coefficient : is it a valuable parameter?, 6 months
Prognosis and outcome, Is there a correlation between early treatment response and outcome? Is diffusion weighted MRI able to predict outcome of the patient (prognostic factor)?, 2 years
