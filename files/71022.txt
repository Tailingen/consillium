Gliadel, XRT, Temodar, Avastin Followed by Avastin, Temodar for Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM)
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of Gliadel wafers at the time of surgery, followed by the combination of radiation, Temodar, and Avastin, and then the combination of Avastin and Temodar, after radiation is complete, on malignant brain tumors.

About six weeks after surgery, subjects will begin standard radiation therapy, a fixed dose of Avastin every 2 weeks, and daily Temodar for the six and a half weeks of radiation. Beginning 2-3 weeks after the last radiation therapy, subjects will be given the same fixed dose of Avastin intravenously (through the vein) every 14 days. They will also be given a higher dose of oral Temodar to take daily the first 5 days of each 28-day study cycle.

DRUG: Gliadel|RADIATION: Radiation Therapy|DRUG: Avastin|DRUG: Temodar
21-month Overall Survival, The percentage of participants alive at 21 months after the start of study treatment. Overall survival was calculated from the date study treatment started until the date of death or the date of last follow-up if alive. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to estimate overall survival., 21 months
Median Overall Survival, Overall survival was defined as the time in months from the start of SRS to the date of death or last contact if alive. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to estimate overall survival., 21 months|Median Progression-free Survival, Progression-free survival was defined as the time in months from the date study treatment started until the date of progression or the date of death if death occurred before progression, or until the date of last follow-up if alive without progression. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to estimate progression-free survival., 21 months|Unacceptable Toxicity Related to the Treatment Regimen, The number of patients experiencing unacceptable toxicity defined as the occurrence of â‰¥ grade 2 CNS hemorrhage or treatment-related grade 4 or 5 non-hematologic toxicity., 27 months
