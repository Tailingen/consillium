Dose Density FU 75 and FU 90 as Adjuvant Therapy for Early Breast Cancer
This is an open -label randomized phase II study of dose-dense Fluorouracil/Epirubicin/Cyclophosphamide (FEC) administered with Epirubicin of 75mg/m2 (FEC75) and Epirubicin 90mg/m2 (FEC90) in untreated patients with early breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: the FEC75 and 95 regimen
The primary objective of this randomized phase II is to determine the relative dose intensity (RDI) of six adjuvant cycles of FEC75 and FEC90 regimens given every 14 days with pegfilgrastim (Neulasta) support in subjects with early breast cancer.
- Incidence of dose delays and dose reductions of planned chemotherapy due to neutropenic events|-Toxicity and tolerability|-disease Free survival (As neither radiotherapy nor hormone therapy are specified and will be carried out according to institutional guidelines, DST has t be interpreted with caution)|- Quality of life
Arm A: the FEC75 regimen will be given at the following doses:

Fluorouracil 500mg/m2 by i.v. bolus or infusion. Epirubicin 75mg/m2 by 30 minutes i.v infusion and Cyclophosphamide 500mg/m2 by i.v bolus or infusion. All three drugs will be administered intravenously on Day 1 of each 14-day cycles.

Arm B: the FEC90 regimen will be given at the following doses:

Fluorouracil 500mg/m2 by i.v. bolus or infusion.Epirubicin 90mg/m2 by 30 minutes i.v infusion and Cyclophosphamide 500mg/m2 by i.v bolus or infusion.

All three drugs will be administered intravenously on Day 1 of each 14-day cycles.

Pegfilgrastim fixed dose of 6mg as a single subcutaneous injection will be given in both arms on Day 2 of each cycle.

Six cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy will be administered in both arms (A + B)
