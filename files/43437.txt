Correlation Between Serum TK1 and Pathological Remission of Breast Cancer With Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
The levels and changes of sTK1 among different outcome groups in BCs with different molecular types were compared by stratification to explore whether sTK1 can be used as one of the tumor markers to predict pathological remission of NACT in BC patients.The changes of serum sTK1 level and ADC before surgery were continuously monitored, and combined with other clinicopathological factors, the pathological remission prediction model of NACT in BC patients was constructed and verified.

Correlation analysis of serum TK1 and pathological remission of breast cancer with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 2026.02
Female patients diagnosed with breast cancer by breast biopsy and receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy in our hospital from 2020 to 2024 were selected as the study objects, and their puncture pathology data, general clinical characteristics, hematology test data, imaging data and surgical pathology data were collected, and the data were collated for statistical analysis. The influencing factors of pCR after neoadjuvant therapy were determined by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis, and the nomogram and ROC curve were drawn. The model was verified internally through bootstrap resampling 1000 times, and the correction curve was drawn to evaluate the prediction ability of the model.
