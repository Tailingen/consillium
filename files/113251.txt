Rehabilitation for Thoracoscopic Lobectomy
The main aim of this research is to compare the functional recovery after discharge with the preoperative physical activity as a hypothesis generating study.

Length of functional rehabilitation, Investigators will calculate preperative Activity Counts per day as a baseline then being compared to postoperative Activity Counts per day until one day when both Counts is equal. Length of functional rehabilitation defines that duration from surgical day to the day when both Counts is equal., Through study completion, minimum 7 days
Quality of recovery, The translation of the Danish version of the postoperative quality of recovery scale QoR-15D is used to evaluate the quality of care., Through study completion, an average of 14 days|The quantization of fatigue, The Christensen Fatigue Scale (ChrFS) will be utilized to evaluate the degree of fatigue., Through study completion, an average of 14 days|The quantization of pain, The numeric rating scale (NRS) ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (excruciating pain) is used to score postoperative pain., Through study completion, an average of 14 days|The quantization of vomiting., The numeric rating scale (NRS) ranging from 0 (nothing) to 10 (worest) is used to score postoperative vomiting., Through study completion, an average of 14 days|The quantization of nausea., The numeric rating scale (NRS) ranging from 0 (nothing) to 10 (worest) is used to score postoperative nausea., Through study completion, an average of 14 days|The quantization of Activity Counts, Investigators will use Electric Devices to record Activity Counts per day. Activity counts will be classified as sedentary behavior (SB) \< 1303 counts/min (cpm), low intensity physical activity (LIPA) 1303 cpm - \< 2588 cpm, and moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) â‰§2588 cpm., Through study completion, an average of 14 days|Length of sleep time, Investigators will use devices to record the specific sleep time for patients., Through study completion, an average of 14 days|The quantization of morbidity, The Clavien-Dindo Classification (CDC) is applied as a standard to grade the morbidity in 30 days after surgery., up to 30 days|The quantization of mortality, Investigators will investigate whether patients will experience unexpected death in 30 days after surgery, up to 30 days
The main aim of this research is to compare the functional recovery after discharge with the preoperative physical activity as a hypothesis generating study.
