Phase I Pilot Study of Biodistribution, Metabolism and Excretion of Novel Radiotracer [18F]Fluorthanatrace (FTT) by PET/CT
Up to 40 evaluable women with known or suspected epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer will participate in two different imaging cohorts. The Biodistribution cohort will include up to 4 patients and the Dynamic cohort will include up to 36 patients. Human dosimetry will be calculated from the Biodistribution cohort. The Dynamic cohort date will evaluate preliminary information on uptake of \[18F\]FTT in gynecological cancer and compare with PARP-1 activity in tissue.
Suspected Epithelial Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer
DRUG: [18F]FluorThanatrace|RADIATION: PET/CT imaging sessions
Number of Adverse Events, 3 years
Primary Objectives

â€¢ Evaluate PARP-1 activity in epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer using measures of uptake of \[18F\]FluorThanatrace

Secondary Objectives

* Evaluate the safety of \[18F\]FluorThanatrace
* Correlate \[18F\]FluorThanatrace uptake measures with BRCA mutation status
* Correlate \[18F\]FluorThanatrace uptake measures with PARP-1 activity in tumor.
* Determine biodistribution of the radioactive investigational drug (\[18F\]FluorThanatrace) in patients and calculate human dosimetry.
* Evaluate change in \[18F\]FluorThanatrace uptake measures after therapy
