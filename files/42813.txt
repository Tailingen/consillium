A PK Study to Compare GME751 (Proposed Pembrolizumab Biosimilar) and US-licensed and EU-authorized Keytruda® in Participants With Stage II and III Melanoma
The purpose of this study is to investigate the pharmacokinetic (PK) similarity and efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of GME751 compared with Keytruda® (pembrolizumab) in subjects with resected advanced melanoma requiring adjuvant treatment with pembrolizumab.
Melanoma
DRUG: GME751|DRUG: Keytruda - EU|DRUG: Keytruda - US
Area Under the Serum Concentration-time Curve from Time Zero to 42 Days (AUC0-42d), The PK similarity (AUC0-42d) of GME751 compared with pembrolizumab will be demonstrated in subjects with advanced melanoma in the adjuvant setting., Day 1 (Postdose) through Day 42|Area Under the Serum Concentration-time Curve Over the Dosing Interval at Steady State, The PK similarity (AUCtau_ss) of GME751 compared with pembrolizumab will be demonstrated in subjects with advanced melanoma in the adjuvant setting., Week 19 through Week 24
Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either GME751, Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-licensed pembrolizumab (Keytruda-US) or European Union (EU)-authorized pembrolizumab (Keytruda-EU). The maximum study duration for a participant will be approximately 28 weeks including screening.

Treatment duration is 24 weeks (4 treatment cycles, each of 6 weeks duration). However, subject should discontinue study participation in case of disease recurrence, unacceptable toxicity or other reasons.

Participants who are benefiting from treatment with pembrolizumab without signs of recurrence or unacceptable toxicity will be eligible for continued pembrolizumab treatment via most suitable option based on the respective country regulations.
