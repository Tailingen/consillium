Vandetanib Gemcitabine Or Placebo Plus Gemcitabine Or Vandetanib Monotherapy In Advanced Biliary Tract Cancer
The primary objective of the trial is to determine the efficacy of VANDETANIB monotherapy or VANDETANIB plus GEMCITABINE or PLACEBO plus GEMCITABINE in prolonging the progression-free survival (PFS) at the trial closure in patients with advanced (unresectable or metastatic) biliary tract cancer.

Progression Free Survival, Progression was defined as Time from the date of first dose of study medication to progression of disease, or death (it also includes patients who are lost to follow-up or have withdrawn consent) and evaluated with RECIST criteria as an increase of at least 20% in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesion(s) taking as reference the smallest sum of LD since the treatment started or any new lesion(s)., up to 1032 days
Objective Tumor Response Rate (CR+PR),, Objective Tumor Response Rate was defined as complete response (CR) + partial response (PR) evaluated by RECIST. CR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions. PR was defined as at least 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameters (LD) of target lesion(s) taking as reference the baseline sum of LD, up to 1032 days|Disease Control Rate (CR+PR+SD), DCR is the sum of patients with a best overall CR, PR or SD (\>=8 weeks) by the patient in the analysis, up to 1032 days|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined from the date of first documentation of response until date of PD or death, up to 1032 days|Overall Survival, OS is defined from the date of randomization to death, up to 1032 days
