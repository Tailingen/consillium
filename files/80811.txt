Universal Genetic Testing Versus Guidelines-Directed Testing for Germline Pathogenic Variants Among Non-Western Patients With Breast Cancer
The study aims to examinethe pattern and frequency of pathogenic variants among all newly diagnosed breast cancer patients in a genetically distinct population. Additionally, the uptake rate of "cascade family screening" , frequency of pathogenic variants and barriers against testing will be studied.
