Impact of Peptides and Chelators on Somatostatin Receptor Antagonists
Somatostatin receptor antagonists are emerging agents in molecular imaging of neuroendocrine tumors. There're two main antagonist peptides, namely JR11 and LM3, which can be coupled with different chelators, DOTA and NODAGA. Previous studies by our and other groups have revealed the different diagnostic performances of these tracers. However, head-to-head comparison data is still missing. In this study, we aim to evaluate the diagnostic performance of four different antagonists, that is, NODAGA-LM3, DOTA-LM3, and NODAGA-JR11, all labeled with gallium-68.

Lesion numbers, Determination of lesion numbers of 68Ga-NODAGA-LM3, 68Ga-DOTA-LM3, and 68Ga-NODAGA-JR11 scan., At 1-hours post-injection|Standard uptake value (SUV), Determination of SUV for detected lesions and discernible organs of 68Ga-NODAGA-LM3, 68Ga-DOTA-LM3, and 68Ga-NODAGA-JR11 scan., At 1-hours post-injection
Patients will be randomly assigned into two arms:

Arm A : 68Ga-NODAGA-LM3 and 68Ga-DOTA-LM3 Arm B : 68Ga-NODAGA-LM3 and 68Ga-NODAGA-JR11

In each arm, patients will undergo PET/CT using assigned tracers. Lesion detection, lesion SUV, and the tumor-to-background ratio will be compared.
