Study of BM230 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This study is a Phase I, multicenter, non-randomized, open-label, first-in-human study of BM230 conducted globally. The study will include two parts: a dose escalation part (Phase Ia) followed by a dose expansion part (Phase Ib). Phase Ia part will estimate the MTD/RED(s) in dose escalation cohorts of patients with advanced solid tumors (HER2-related solid tumors). The Phase Ib part will enroll 5 distinct cohorts of patients with advanced solid tumors related to HER2 under MTD/RED doses, to better define the safety profile of BM230 and evaluate the efficacy of BM230.
