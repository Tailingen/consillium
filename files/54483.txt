Hypofractionated IMRT With Temozolomide for HGG
To evaluate safety and feasibility of hypofractionated IMRT in addition to chemotherapy, concomitant and adjuvant, in patients with newly diagnosed HGGs after surgery.

Primary endpoint: progression free survival (PFS), Overall Survival (OS) and Toxicity.

Secondary endpoint: to evaluate Quality of life (QoL) of patients after surgery, concomitant chemoradiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy through neuropsychological examination.

RADIATION: Hypofractionated IMRT
Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression free survival is defined by any of the following: â‰¥ 25% increase in sum of the products of perpendicular diameters of enhancing lesions (compared with baseline if no decrease) on stable or increasing doses of corticosteroids; a significant increase in T2/FLAIR non-enhancing lesions on stable or increasing dose of corticosteroids compared with baseline scan or best response after initial of therapy, not due to comorbid events; the appearance of any new lesions; clear progression of non-measurable lesions; or definite clinical deterioration not attributable to another causes apart from the tumor, or to decrease in corticosteroid dose., 1 year
Quality of Life (QoL) of Patients After Surgery, Concomitant Chemo-radiotherapy and Adjuvant Chemotherapy, Quality of life (QoL) of patients after surgery, concomitant chemoradiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy is evaluated through neuropsychological examination using the Milano-Bicocca Battery (MIBIB). This battery investigated language, memory, apraxia, including visuo-constructional abilities, executive functions and spatial cognition., 1 year
We designed a study of a hypofractionated intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), using VMAT RapidArc approach. The potential advantage of this approach is to deliver a more selective irradiation to tumor's target with reducing dose to normal brain and to allow to deliver a higher dose, optimizing the therapeutic window
