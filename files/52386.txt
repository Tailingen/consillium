FUS-TB VS COG-TB in Small Lesions of Prostate Cancer
To compare the positive detection rates of COG-TB vs FUS-TB for prostate cancer with PI-RADS 4 small lesions.
Prostate Cancer
PROCEDURE: COG-TB: Cognitive Fusion guided prostate targeted Biopsy|PROCEDURE: FUS-TB: MRI-TRUS Fusion guided prostate targeted Biopsy
detection rate of any PCa, detection rate of any prostate cancer, 1 week (after pathology）
detection rate(cs PCa and PCa) of TBx, detection rate for PI-RADS 4 small lesion (\<5mm) under MRI-TRUS fusion, 1 week (after pathology）
Prostate cancer (PCA) is the most frequent malignancy in male urogenital system. According to the World Health Organization's 2020 GLOBOCAN statistics, there are approximately 1.4 million new cases and 375,000 deaths worldwide. PCa is the second most common tumor in male patients after lung cancer and ranks fifth among cancer causes of death.

Currently, prostate specific antigen ( PSA ), digital rectal examination (DRE), multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI), prostate specific membrane antigen positron emission Tomography/computed tomography (PSMA PET/CT) and other detection methods have played an important role in the diagnosis of PCa, but the gold standard for confirming PCa is the histopathological examination of prostate biopsy. Performing mpMRI before biopsy can help detect and locate prostate cancer with ISUP grade ≥2. Studies have shown that the prostate imaging reporting and data system (PI-RADS) may help improve the detection of clinically significant cancers. Biopsy should be considered when PI-RADS score 4 or 5.

This clinical study intends to use the mpMRI-TRUS image fusion ultrasound system to assist in guiding FUS-TB, comparing to COG-TB to evaluate the application value of mpMR-TRUS image fusion in the detection of PCa in prostate biopsy.
