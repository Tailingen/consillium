ESTIMation of the ABiLity of Prophylactic Central Compartment Neck Dissection to Modify Outcomes in Low-risk Differentiated Thyroid Cancer
Prospective randomized open phase III non-inferiority trial in cT1bT2N0 papillary thyroid carcinoma comparing: total thyroidectomy alone (experimental group) versus total thyroidectomy + Prophylactic Neck Dissection PND (reference group).

Pre-registered patients will be randomized before surgery for tumors with class-6 cytology (Bethesda) or in the operating room after confirmation of malignancy by frozen section analysis for tumors with class-5 cytology.
