AutologousCD22 Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)T Cells in w/Recurrent/Refractory B Cell Lymphomas
This is a non-randomized clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CD22CART administered after lymphodepleting chemotherapy in adults with relapsed / refractory B Cell Lymphomas. All evaluable participants will be followed for overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), and duration of response (DOR). An evaluable participant is one who completes leukapheresis, lymphodepleting chemotherapy and CART infusion.
