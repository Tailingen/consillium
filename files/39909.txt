Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: HEC169096
Phase 1: MTD and RP2D of HEC169096, Determination of Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of HEC169096, Cycle 1 (28 days) of treatment for MTD and at the end of every 2 cycle for RP2D for approximately 12 months or earlier if participant terminates from the study|Phase 2: Overall Response Rate, As assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), through study completion, an average of 1 year
This is an open-label, multi-center Phase 1/2 study in participants with advanced solid tumors, including RET fusion-positive NSCLC, MTC, and other tumors with RET activation. Phase I of this study includes a dose-escalation phase and a dose-expansion phase , which will focus on exploring MTD and/or RP2D of HEC169096 in patients with advanced solid tumours; Phase II will assess the efficacy and safety of HEC169096 at the RP2D dose.
