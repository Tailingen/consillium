Sorafenib with Low-dose FP Group

Sorafenib will be administered orally at a dose of 400 mg (2 x 200 mg tablets) twice daily (bid) for 28 days. Cisplatin at the dose of 20mg/m2 will be administered at day 1 and day8, and fluorouracil at the dose of 330mg/m2 will be administered continuously at day1-day5, and day8-day12 via the implanted catheter system.
