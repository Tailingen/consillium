Clinical Trial of Clarithromycin, Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone in the Treatment of the First Relapsed Multiple Myeloma
BiRd regimen consisting of clarithromycin and Rd is safe and effective in NDMM. It can significantly increase ORR (up to 90.3%) , relief depth (≥VGPR), and prolong PFS to 43 months. In our previous study, thirty RRMM patients treated with BiRd regimen in 6 centers in China benefited.It suggested that BiRd regimen may not only improve overall efficacy of RRMM , especially long-term benefits, but also reverse Rd resistance in patients who fail to achieve any remission after multiline therapy.The study is a Prospective, Multicenter, Single Arm, Phase II Clinical Trial, which intend to recruit first relapse MM patients over 18 years old. Once included, patients will receive the treatment of Clarithromycin Lenalidomide Dexamethasone (BiRd) Regimen. (Clarithromycin 500mg，po，bid，d1-21; Lenalidomide 25mg，po，daily，d1-21 (dose according to creatinine clearance rate); Dexamethasone 20mg，po，daily，d1-2, 8-9,15-16, 22-23) And we will evaluate efficacy and adverse events of the BiRd regimen at a point of time predetermined.
Multiple Myeloma in Relapse
DRUG: Clarithromycin Lenalidomide Dexamethasone (BiRd) Regimen
Objective response rate (ORR), According to the criteria of IMWG 2016, Every 2 months until disease progression or study completion，an average of 2 year
Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by NCI-CTCAE v4.03, According to NCI-CTCAE version 4.03, Through study completion,an average of 2 year|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS were calculated from the enrollment to the first instance of disease progression, relapse, or death, Through study completion, an average of 2 year|Overall Survival (OS), OS were calculated from the time of enrollment to death or the last follow-up, Through study completion, an average of 2 year|Duration of Response (DOR), the time from the first assessment of CR (complete response) or PR (partial response) to the first PD (Progressive Disease) or any cause of death, Through study completion, an average of 2 year
Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL), According to the data of SF-36 Quality of Life Questionnaire Survey, Every 6 months until disease progression or study completion，an average of 2 year
