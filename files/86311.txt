Creating an Innovative AI-based Technology TCRact for Designing and Optimizing T-cell Receptors (TCR) for Use in Cancer Immunotherapies
The PROJECT OBJECTIVE is to create an innovative AI-based (Artificial Intelligence) IN SILICO TECHNOLOGY for the design and optimization of T-cell receptors (TCRs) capable of recognizing specific tumor antigens presented on Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA). The technology will be based on bioinformatics (including molecular modelling) and artificial intelligence (including predictive, generative and optimization models). PROJECT TASKS are dedicated to the implementation of individual technological components (including the database necessary for their preparation) and to performing IN VITRO evaluation rounds to optimize the technology.

Integration, within an IN SILICO TECHNOLOGY, of processes which currently require huge amounts of in vitro laboratory experiments that are necessary for bringing new TCR-based cancer immunotherapies into clinical trials:

* finding appropriate TCRs targeting cancer neoantigen presented on a HLA molecule (pHLA)
* testing for potential TCR toxicity (targeting self antigens presented on healthy tissues)
* optimization of pHLA:TCR binding affinity and toxicity.
