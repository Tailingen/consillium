Everolimus Combined With PD-1 in Advanced Colorectal Cancer Patients
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn about efficacy of Everolimus in combination with PD-1 in patients with locally advanced and advanced colorectal cancer that cannot be R0 resected. The main question is to explore the survival time, safety and tolerability of the treatment. At the same time, the correlation between biomarkers (including PD-L1 expression, tumor mutation load, lymphocyte subpopulation, cytokines, TCR, intestinal microbes, and others) and the efficacy and drug resistance mechanism will be analyzed, so as to provide reference for the subsequent guidance of the screening of benefit groups.

Everolimus is an oral protein kinase inhibitor of the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) serine/threonine kinase signal transduction pathway. Studies have shown that immunotherapy combined with protein kinase inhibitor has initial efficacy in the treatment of colorectal cancer. Therefore, the objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Everolimus in combination with PD-1 in patients with locally advanced and advanced colorectal cancer that cannot be R0 resected.
