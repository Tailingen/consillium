A Prospective Registry for Patients at High-Risk for Pancreatic Cancer
This study aims to facilitate discovery and validation of tests for early detection in subjects at high risk for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and to facilitate the use of state-of-the-art machine learning-based algorithms that utilize databases and images with the purpose of identifying early stages of pancreatic cancer, as well as people at high-risk.The study also aims to provide a platform for development of an interventional protocol for early detection of PDAC.

Collection of biospecimen samples (blood and pancreatic juice), Sufficient biospecimens (blood and pancreatic juice) will be collected in 10 years from participants to provide a resource for nested case-control studies of promising biomarkers for discovery and validation of tests for early detection in subjects at high risk for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).., Up to 10 years|Collection of radiology images and videos, Collect and archive radiology images and videos obtained during esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EDG)-endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in high risk individuals undergoing screening and surveillance tests. An imaging dataset designed for studies of promising imaging biomarkers and developing AI-assisted algorithms can be collected within10 years., Up to 10 years
