A Dose Confirmation and Pharmacokinetic Study of Pegcrisantaspase Administered as Intravenous (IV) Infusion in Children and Young Adults With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) /Lymphoblastic Lymphoma (LBL). Following Hypersensitivity to Pegaspargase (Oncaspar)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness,safety, and dosage of pegcrisantaspase in patients with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) / Lymphoblastic Lymphoma (LBL).
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia|Lymphoblastic Lymphoma
DRUG: pegcrisantaspase
The Response Rate in Children & Young Adults With ALL/LBL and Hypersensitivity to Pegaspargase Defined as the Proportion of Subjects Having a Serum Asparaginase Activity (SAA) Level of >= 0.1 IU/mL Following the First IV Dose in Course 1, 15 days during Course 1|The Serum Asparaginase Activity 14 Days After the First Infusion of Study Drug and the Adverse Events in All Participants., 1 Year
The Pharmakokinetic (PK) Profile of IV Pegcrisantaspase in Children and Young Adults With ALL/LBL and Hypersensitivity to Pegaspargase. Pharmakokinetic Profiles to be Assessed Are: Half Life, Elimination Rate, Tmax, Cmax, AUC., 14 Days|The SAA Levels Over Time Following Repeated Administration in Children and Young Adults ALL/LBL and Hypersensitivity to Pegaspargase, 30 Days|The Immunogenicity of IV Pegcristaspase by Testing Anti-pegcrisantaspase and Anti-PEG Binding and Neutralizing Antibodies, 30 Days
The purpose of the study was to assess the response rate in children and young adults with ALL/LBL and hypersensitivity to pegaspargase defined as the proportion of subjects having a serum asparaginase activity (SAA) level of â‰¥ 0.1 IU/mL 14 days following the first IV pegcrisantaspase dose in Course 1. Also, to assess the safety of IV pegcrisantaspase therapy in children and young adults with ALL/LBL with hypersensitivity to pegaspargase.
