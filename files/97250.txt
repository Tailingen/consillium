Next Generation Sequencing Method for the Detection of EGFR Gene Mutations in the Plasma of Patients with Lung Cancer
The study aims to evaluate the Plasma-SeqSensei™ Solid Cancer IVD Kit NGS diagnostic test (Sysmex) before its introduction into routine diagnostics. This is a test for research of EGFR mutations in cfDNA that needs to be evaluated in a patient population with lung adenocarcinoma already characterized for EGFR mutations by a molecular test of reference. The proposed study does not present any risk to participants.
Carcinoma, Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Plasma- SeqSensei™ Solid Cancer IVD Kit (Sysmex)|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: cobas® EGFR Mutation Test v2 (Roche)
Primary Outcome, Evaluate the capability of the NGS test Plasma-SeqSensei™ Solid Cancer IVD Kit (Sysmex) in detecting a greater number of EGFR mutations compared to the diagnostic test routine cobas® EGFR Mutation Test v2 (Roche), Through study completion, an average of 1 year
Secondary Outcome, Check if the NGS Plasma-SeqSensei™ Solid Cancer IVD Kit (Sysmex) is comparable to conventional test (cobas® EGFR MutationTest v2 (Roche)) in the detection of the mutational status of EGFR, Through study completion, an average of 1 year
