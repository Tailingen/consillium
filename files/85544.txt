Evaluation of Memory Skills in Patients Receiving Radiation Therapy for Brain Metastases
RATIONALE: Assessment of patients undergoing radiation therapy may help to determine the effects of the treatment and may help improve cancer treatment.

PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the memory skills in patients receiving radiation therapy for brain metastases.
Cognitive/Functional Effects|Metastatic Cancer|Radiation Toxicity
PROCEDURE: management of therapy complications|PROCEDURE: quality-of-life assessment
Feasibility of performing a test battery of neurocognitive and quality of life measures, From registration to one month post radiation therapy
OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the feasibility of performing a test battery consisting of five neurocognitive measures and a quality of life instrument following radiotherapy in patients with brain metastases.

OUTLINE: Patients undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 3 weeks. Quality of life and neurocognitive function is assessed before study, at completion of radiotherapy, and at 1 month after completion of radiotherapy. Patients are followed at 1 month.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study over 5 months.
