Risk Stratification of Nodal PTCL
This study is to investigate the prognostic significance of enhanced International Prognostic Index (NCCN-IPI) and post-treatment PET results in patients with newly diagnosed nodal peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), and establish a risk stratification model for nodal PTCL patients.
