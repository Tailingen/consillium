An Observational Study of Bevacizumab in Combination With 5-FU-Based Chemotherapy in Chinese Participants With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
This observational study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of Bevacizumab in combination with 5-Fluorouracil based chemotherapy as first-line and second-line therapy in Chinese participants with metastatic colorectal cancer. Data will be collected from each participant for up to 3 years.
Colorectal Cancer
Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events, An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant after administration of a pharmaceutical product and which did not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment., 36 months|Percentage of Participants With Serious Adverse Events, A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) was any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose was fatal, required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, was a congenital anomaly/birth defect, was medically significant, or required intervention to prevent one or other of the outcomes listed above., 36 months|Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events of Special Interest, 36 months|Percentage of Participants With Bevacizumab-Related Adverse Events, 36 months|Percentage of Participants With Bevacizumab-related Serious Adverse Events, 36 months
Percentage of Participants Achieving an Overall Response, Overall response was defined as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) confirmed per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. CR: Disappearance of all target lesions, all non-target lesions, and no new lesions. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, no progression in non-target lesions, and no new lesions., 36 months|Progression-free Survival, Progression-free-survival (PFS) was defined as the time from the date when the participant signed the informed consent form to the time of first documented disease progression or death, whichever occurred first., 36 months|One-year Progression-free Survival Rate, One year progression-free survival rate was defined as the percentage of participants who were free of progression or death from the date when the participant signed the informed consent form to one year., 1 year|One-year Survival Rate, 1 year|Percentage of Participants Achieving an Overall Response Per Kirsten Rat Sarcoma Viral (KRAS) Oncogene Subgroup, Overall response was defined as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) confirmed per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. CR: Disappearance of all target lesions, all non-target lesions, and no new lesions. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, no progression in non-target lesions, and no new lesions. Results are reported per participants' Kirsten Rat Sarcoma Viral (KRAS) oncogene subgroup., 36 months|One-year Progression-free Survival Rate Per KRAS Subgroup, One year progression-free survival rate was defined as the percentage of participants who were free of progression or death from the date when the participant signed the informed consent form to one year. Results are reported per participants' Kirsten Rat Sarcoma Viral (KRAS) oncogene subgroup., 1 year|One-year Survival Rate by the KRAS Subgroup, 1 year|Percentage of Participants Achieving an Overall Response by the Chemotherapy Regimen Subgroup, Overall response was defined as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) confirmed per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. CR: Disappearance of all target lesions, all non-target lesions, and no new lesions. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, no progression in non-target lesions, and no new lesions. Results are reported per participants' chemotherapy regimen subgroup., Up to 36 Months|One-year Progression-free Survival Rate Per Chemotherapy Regimen Subgroup, One year progression-free survival rate was defined as the percentage of participants who were free of progression or death from the date when the participant signed the informed consent form to one year. Results are reported per participants' chemotherapy regimen subgroup., 1 year|One-year Survival Rate by the Chemotherapy Regimen Subgroup, 1 year|Quality of Life: European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 Questionnaire, Quality of life was assessed at baseline and every three months after treatment by the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. The possible score range was 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating better functioning., Up to 36 Months
