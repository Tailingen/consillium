Cervical Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Lay Health Advisor Education Intervention|BEHAVIORAL: Usual Care Group
Receipt of Cervical Cancer screening via Pap Test, the primary outcome of interest for Project 1 intervention will be a dichotomous variable, Pap smear in the past 12-14 months (yes/no). Initially, We will assess the univariate difference between treatment groups (lay health advisor vs. brochure and physician letter) in the proportion of women who received a Pap smear during the past 12 months using design-based logistic regression., past 12-14 months (yes/no).
The overall goal of Project 1 is to increase early detection of cervical cancer by increasing the proportion of Appalachian women, age 18 and older, who receive Pap smears at appropriate intervals and return for follow-up care when necessary. The project was implemented in Appalachian Ohio, a mainly rural and underserved area with a population comprised of 1.5 million adults, aged 18 and older, and used community-based participatory research (CBPR) and community relationships already established in the area by Center investigators.
