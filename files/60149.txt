Breast Cancer Risk After Diagnostic Gene Sequencing
Study of the psychological impact of breast cancer risk communication in Cancer Genetics based on the personalized estimation of the BOADICEA V5/PLUS model ("Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation Algorithm-version 5 or PLUS").
Genetic Predisposition to Disease
GENETIC: BRIDGES gene panel testing|GENETIC: Breast cancer risk polygenic risk score (PRS)|BEHAVIORAL: Questionnaires
Psychosocial Assessment in Hereditary Cancer questionnaire (PAHC)., Breast or ovarian cancer risk perception (the impact of communicating a personalized breast cancer risk using the BOADICEAV5/PLUS model) using a PAHC questionnaire. Questionnaire items are responded on a 4-level scale from 1 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). Item response scores are averaged and standardized on a 0 to 100 scale, with an increased value indication more severe difficulties., Up to 6 months
Difference on the PAHC score between counselees who receive a pathogenic variant indicating breast cancer versus (VS) who did not receive such result, Counselee's perceived lifetime risks of developing (a first or second) BC will be measured at T2 in words (Not concerned, Don't know, Low risk, Low to moderate risk, Moderate risk, High risk, Very high risk, Major Risk) and in figures (Not concerned, Don't know, 0-10%; between 11-20%, 21-40%, 41-60%, 61-80% and over 80%)., Up to 6 months|Percentage of counselees intending to undertake risk reducing mastectomy (the one who received a pathogenic variant VS who did not receive such result), Counselees' choice of cancer risk management will be assessed using a study-specific self-administered questionnaire based on the literature \[Julian-Reynier, 2010\] asking about women's intention or choice to undergo regular mammography, regular breast ultrasound, MRI or preventive mastectomy on a 6-option response scale (Yes, certainly; Yes, probably; I don't know; No, probably not; No, certainly not; Not concerned)., Up to 6 months|Percentage of counselees who communicate their result to their sister(s) (the one who received a pathogenic variant VS who did not receive such result), It will be assessed using a study-specific self-administered questionnaire based on the literature \[de Geus, 2015\] asking about women's whether they informed about genetic testing among her husband/partner, children, mother, father, sister(s), brother(s), friend(s) or other family member(s) using a 4, 5 or 5-option response scale depending on the person (Yes, I informed him/her/them; No, but I plan to do it; No (no partner); No; Yes all of them; Yes, some of them; No (children too young); No (no children/brother/sister); No (mother/father deceased)., Up to 6 months
The new BC gene testing and risk estimation using BOADICEA V5/PLUS model imply an increased complexity of communication during the cancer genetic consultation. It will be proposed to women referred to genetic counselling in the participating Cancer Genetic Clinics .

New qualitative (moderate risks, secondary results) and quantitative results (variation in the degree of cancer risk identified for the counselee and family members) and thus a personalized breast cancer risk may be obtained. How this complexity affects counselees' psychological reactions is not known.

It is primarily aimed at comparing psychosocial needs and distress in healthy women (unaffected with BC) at high risk of breast or ovarian cancer undergoing genetic testing based on an enriched gene panel (index case gene panel plus PRS) at Curie Institute in France and at the University Hospital in Cologne, Germany.
