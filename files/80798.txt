PET Study in Patients With Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as fluorine 18-fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) scans, may help doctors predict a patient's response to treatment and help plan the best treatment.

PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying fluorine 18-fludeoxyglucose PET scan to see how well it predicts outcomes in patients who have undergone high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant for non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
Lymphoma
RADIATION: fluorine 18-fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography
Correlation of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of fluorine 18-fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scan with with patients' clinical outcomes., from the date of stem cell transplant to date of clinical disease progression or to date of last follow-up
Progression-free survival, from date of stem cell transplant to date of clinical disease progression or date of last follow-up
OBJECTIVES:

* To determine if a fluorine 18-fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scan, performed as early as day 30 after high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation, may be useful in identifying patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma who may benefit from early interventions, including reduced intensity stem cell transplantation or additional therapy, to preempt disease relapse and improve overall survival.

OUTLINE: Conventional imaging, biopsy, and clinical examination findings are reviewed to determine patient clinical outcome (e.g., complete remission, disease progression/relapse, or death related to the primary disease).
