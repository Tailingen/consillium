Development of a Model to Predict the Risk of Venous Thromboembolic Events in Patients With Metastatic Bronchopulmonary Cancer
Venous thrombo-embolism (VTE) is a frequent and serious complication of cancer. However, predictive tools for VTE in cancer patients is lacking.

In patients with metastatic broncho-pulmonarycancer, biochemical characteristics might help to identify patients at high risk for VTE.

The aim of this study is to derive a predictive score combining clinical and biochemical variable that predict VTE in metastatic broncho-pulmonary cancer.

Venous thrombo-embolism (VTE) is a frequent and serious complication of cancer. However, predictive tools for VTE in cancer patients is lacking.

In patients with metastatic broncho-pulmonarycancer, biochemical characteristics might help to identify patients at high risk for VTE, particularly in adenocarcinoma.

The aim of this study is to derive a predictive score combining clinical and biochemical variable that predict VTE in metastatic broncho-pulmonary cancer.
