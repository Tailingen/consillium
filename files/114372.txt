Pemetrexed Plus Gemcitabine as Front-Line Chemotherapy for Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Clinical Trial
The purposes of this study are to determine:

1. The safety of Pemetrexed plus Gemcitabine and any side effects that might be associated with the combination of these two drugs.
2. Whether Pemetrexed plus Gemcitabine can help patients with non-small cell lung cancer live longer.
3. Whether Pemetrexed plus Gemcitabine can make the tumor smaller or disappear, and for how long.
4. To see if patients feel better while taking Pemetrexed plus Gemcitabine.
