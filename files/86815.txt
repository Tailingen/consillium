A Phase I Study of INC280 in Japanese Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
INC280 will be administered to Japanese patients with advanced soid tumors whose disease has progressed despite standard therapy or for whom no standard therapy exists. The trial will assess the safety and tolerability and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) on INC280
