Weekly Docetaxel Versus Weekly Docetaxel/Gemcitabine in the Treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer in Elderly Patients
In this randomized trial, we attempt to further define optimal palliative chemotherapy for elderly patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer by comparing single agent treatment with weekly docetaxel versus combination therapy with weekly docetaxel plus gemcitabine.

Upon determination of eligibility, patients will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms:

Docetaxel Docetaxel + Gemcitabine

For ever 2 patients treated, 1 will receive treatment A (docetaxel) and 1 will receive treatment B (Docetaxel + Gemcitabine). The study is not blinded so both the patient and the doctor will know which treatment has been assigned.
