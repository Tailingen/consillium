OFS in Premenopausal Node+ Breast Cancer With Low Genomic Risk
Among ER+HER2- premenopausal patients with N1 who undergoes primary breast surgery, we will identify the patients with a genomic low risk using the multigene-assay (OncoFREE®).

In these, ovarian function suppression with endocrine therapies including either tamoxifen or aromatase-inhibitors will be administered for 5 years.
