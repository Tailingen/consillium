Celebrex - Cervix: Celecoxib in the Treatment of Patients With Locally Advanced Carcinoma of the Cervix
This is a phase I/II study to evaluate the safety and toxicity of celecoxib in combination with standard concurrent cisplatin and radiotherapy in women with locally advanced cervix cancer. In addition, we aim to determine the effect of celecoxib (Celebrex) on tumour oxygenation, interstitial fluid pressure, COX-2 levels, prostaglandin E2 levels, angiogenesis and apoptosis.
