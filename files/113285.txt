SCH 66336 Plus Gemcitabine in Treating Patients With Advanced Cancer of the Urinary Tract
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining SCH 66336 and gemcitabine may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of SCH 66336 plus gemcitabine in treating patients who have advanced cancer of the urinary tract.
Bladder Cancer|Transitional Cell Cancer of the Renal Pelvis and Ureter|Urethral Cancer
DRUG: gemcitabine hydrochloride|DRUG: lonafarnib
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the feasibility and toxicity of SCH 66336 and gemcitabine in patients with advanced transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary tract.
* Determine the time to progression and objective response rate of this treatment regimen in these patients.
* Assess the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and oral SCH 66336 twice a day (starting on day 2 of the first course, and starting on day 1 of all subsequent courses). Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients are followed every 8 weeks until disease progression.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 7-31 patients will be accrued for this study.
