Prospective Clinicogenomic Program
The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of a scalable, prospective research program for participants with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC) or extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) planning to start standard-of-care (SOC) systemic anti-cancer treatment. The study will also examine ctDNA status over the course of treatment as a predictor of response to therapy.
