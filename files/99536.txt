Trial of Chemoradiation and Pembrolizumab in Patients With Rectal Cancer
This is a phase II, prospective open label multi-center study in which subjects with stage II-III rectal cancer will be accrued in order to determine the pathological complete response rate of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab in combination with chemoradiation treatment (CRT). Subjects must have a diagnosis of rectal cancer, stage II (T3-4, N0) or stage III (any T, N1-2). Subjects must have received no prior treatments (chemotherapy, pelvic radiation or surgery) for their rectal cancer.

Eligible subjects will receive standard chemoradiation with pembrolizumab administered every 3 weeks on days 1, 22, and 43 of the neoadjuvant interval. In all subjects, restaging endorectal or pelvic MRI with chest and abdominal CT will be performed at 6-8 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant treatment to determine resectability and to rule out any evidence of metastases. Subjects who have resectable disease will undergo surgery within 2-4 weeks of imaging; 8-12 weeks after completion of chemoradiation. Subjects who are found to have unresectable or metastatic disease post treatment with the combination of CRT+ pembrolizumab should receive standard of care definitive treatment per the discretion of their treating physician.

OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

NEOADJUVANT TREATMENT:

All subjects will receive concurrent chemoradiation and pembrolizumab neoadjuvant treatment for 6 weeks:

* Pembrolizumab 200 mg Intravenously (IV) Days 1, 22 and 43
* Capecitabine 825 mg/m2 PO (by mouth) in twice daily doses (daily total 1650 mg/m2) on 5 consecutive days / week Monday-Friday given on the radiation days for 28 days
* Radiation 50.4 Gy (Gray) in daily fractions of 1.8 Gy over a 6 week interval,excludes weekends

POST NEOADJUVANT TREATMENT:

* End of treatment (EOT) 6-8 weeks after last dose of neoadjuvant treatment, all subjects will be assessed to determine resectability. Those with resectable disease will undergo surgery within 2-4 weeks of imaging, 8-12 weeks after completion of chemoradiation. Subjects who are found to have unresectable or metastatic disease post treatment with the combination of CRT+ pembrolizumab should receive standard of care definitive treatment per the discretion of their treating physician.
* Surgical Resection ( 2-4 weeks after restaging imaging and 8-12 weeks after completion of chemoradiation)
* Follow Up
* Post Operative Visit (4-6 weeks after surgery)
* Disease Follow Up -Years 1-2 (per site investigator discretion; suggested every 3-6 months)
* Survival Follow Up - Years 3-5

To demonstrate adequate organ function, all screening labs should be performed within 7 days of treatment initiation:

Hematological:

* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1,500 /mcL
* Platelets ≥100,000 / mcL
* Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL without transfusion or erythropoietin (EPO) dependency (within 7 days of assessment)

Renal:

* Serum creatinine ≤1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN) OR
* Measured or calculated creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min for subject with creatinine levels \> 1.5 X institutional ULN Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) can also be used in place of creatinine or CrCl

Hepatic:

* Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN
* Aspartate transaminase (AST) / Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) ≤ 2.5 X ULN
* Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) / Serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 X ULN
* Albumin ≥2.5 mg/dL

Coagulation:

* International Normalized Ratio (INR) or Prothrombin Time (PT) ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy (as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants)
* Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy (as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants)
