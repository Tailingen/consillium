Study in Myeloma Patients Newly Diagnosed Treated as an Induction With Velcade-Dex or Velcade (Bortezomib) Thalidomide Dexamethasone (VTD)
Primary objective:

* Compare the complete remission (CR) rates (i.e., the true CR, with negative immunofixation) achieved with either four courses of VD or four courses of VTD.

Secondary objectives:

* Compare the following parameters following 4 cycles of VD or VTD induction treatment:

  * CR rate+ very good partial remission (VGPR) rate
  * Overall remission rate (CR + VGPR + partial remission (PR) rate)
  * K/l light chain ratio in patients in CR.
  * Safety (quality of the sampled stem cells, extrahaematological and haematological toxicity: specially neurological toxicity, length of hospitalization).
* Compare the CR rate and the CR + VGPR rates after post-induction autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT).
