Patient Registry in Patients Undergoing Contrast-Enhanced Harmonic Endoscopic Ultrasound Imaging
This study creates a patient registry of patients undergoing contrast-enhances-harmonic endoscopic ultrasound imaging. In order to improve what doctors see on the ultrasound exam, sometimes intravenous contrast can be used to better emphasize the blood flow in a particular organ or lesion. Creating a local database that can be used as a patients registry may help doctors keep track of all patients that undergo contrast-enhanced endoscopic ultrasound procedures and also to monitor for possible procedure adverse events.

OTHER: Electronic Health Record Review
Analyse continuous variable outcomes of patient undergoing contrast-enhanced harmonic endoscopic ultrasound imaging using medical record review and T-tests or Mann-Whitney U test., Descriptive statistical analysis will be carried out at routine intervals for database analysis. Two-sided P values less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. For descriptive analyses, continuous variables will be reported as a mean +/- standard deviation or median (interquartile range) and compared based on either T-tests or Mann-Whitney U test., Up to 5 years|Analyse categorical variable outcomes of patient undergoing contrast-enhanced harmonic endoscopic ultrasound imaging using medical record review and chi-square test or Fisher's exact test., Descriptive statistical analysis will be carried out at routine intervals for database analysis. Two-sided P values less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Categorical variables will be reported as frequencies with percentages and compared using the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test., Up to 5 years|Analyse multivariables of patient undergoing contrast-enhanced harmonic endoscopic ultrasound imaging using medical record review and logistic regression or linear regression analyses depending on the outcome., Descriptive statistical analysis will be carried out at routine intervals for database analysis. Two-sided P values less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Multivariable analyses will be performed using logistic regression or linear regression analyses depending on the outcome, i.e. dichotomous or continuous respectively., Up to 5 years
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To describe the findings and outcomes of patient undergoing contrast-enhanced harmonic endoscopic ultrasound (CE-EUS) imaging.

OUTLINE: This is an observational study.

Patients who have undergo contrast-enhanced harmonic endoscopic ultrasound imaging have their medical records reviewed.
