A Study of SAR444245 With or Without Other Anticancer Therapies for the Treatment of Adults and Adolescents With Relapsed or Refractory B Cell Lymphoma (Master Protocol) [Pegathor Lymphoma 205]
The is a phase 2 multi-cohort, un-controlled, non-randomized, open-label, multi-center study assessing the antitumor activity and safety of non-alpha interleukin (IL-2) SAR444245 with or without other anticancer therapies in participants aged 12 years and older with relapsed or refractory B cell lymphoma. This study is structured as a master protocol with separate sub studies designed to investigate the use of SAR444245 either with or without other anticancer therapies for the treatment of relapsed or refractory B cell lymphoma.

Substudy 1-Cohort A aims to establish safety and preliminary anti-tumor activity for non-alpha interleukin (IL-2) SAR444245 combined with the anti-PD1 antibody, pembrolizumab in trial participants with classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) who are anti-PD-(L)1-naive and have received at least 2 or 3 lines of systemic therapy.

Substudy 3-Cohort C1 aims to establish safety and preliminary anti-tumor activity for SAR444245 as monotherapy in trial participants with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Trial participants in this study must have received at least 2 lines of systemic therapy and have either stable or progressive disease 1-3 months post Health Authority approved Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell (CAR-T) treatment when given as last systemic treatment prior to study enrollment.

Complete Response Rate- Cohort A, Cohorts A:

The duration of the study for an individual patient will start from the signature of the main informed consent and include:

a screening period of up to 28 days;

a treatment period \[max\] 35 cycles (21 days per cycle) for Cohort A and 52 cycles (14 days per cycle) for Cohort C1 or until occurrence of unacceptable toxicities or until PD;

an end-of-treatment visit at least approximately 30 days following the last administration of study drug (or until the patient receives another anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier);

and a follow-up visits 3 months after treatment discontinuation and every 3 months thereafter following, until disease progression, or initiation of another antitumor treatment, or death, whichever is earlier.
