Phase II Study of BL-B01D1 and Almonertinib for EGFR+ Stage II-IIIB NSCLC
This is a Phase II, open-labeled, single-arm, study of neoadjuvant BL-B01D1in combination with Almonertinib followed by adjuvant Almonertinib for the treatment of Patients with EGFR-Mutation Positive Stage II-IIIB Resectable Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: BL-B01D1|DRUG: Almonertinib
Pathological complete response (pCR), Defined as absence of any viable cancer cells in the dissected tumour samples, including the main tumour, lymph nodes, and margins as assessed per central pathology laboratory post-surgery, Approximately 9-11 weeks after the first dose|Major Pathological Response (MPR), Defined as ≤10% residual cancer cells in the main tumour, as assessed per central pathology laboratory post-surgery, Approximately 9-11 weeks after the first dose
Objective Response Rate（ORR）, ORR is the proportion of subjects with CR or PR , based on RECIST v1.1., Approximately 9-11 weeks after the first dose|Event-free survival (EFS), An event is defined as documented disease progression that precludes surgery or prevents completion of definitive surgery; recurrence or a new lesion, local or distant (a new primary malignancy, confirmed by pathology if clinically feasible, is not considered to be an EFS event); death due to any cause, From date of first administration up to approximately 5.5 years after the last patient is administrated|Disease free survival (DFS), DFS is defined as the time from the date of surgery until the first date of disease recurrence (local or distant) or date of death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., From date of first administration up to approximately 3.5 years after the last patient is administrated|Overall Survival (OS), OS will be defined as the time from the date of first dosing until death due to any cause, From date of first administration up to approximately 5.5 years after the last patient is administrated|R0 resection rate, R0 resection rate is defined as the proportion of subjects with complete surgical resection with microscopically negative margins (no residual cancer cells at the edges of the excised tissue)., Approximately 9-11 weeks after the first dose|The type, frequency and severity of adverse events during treatment (TEAE) and treatment-related adverse events (TRAE), From the time of enrollment to either 28-days after the last dose of last study treatment for patients who do not undergo surgery, or 90-days post-surgery
Biomarker expression in tumor tissues, From date of first administration up to approximately 5.5 years after the last patient is administrated
