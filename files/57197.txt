A Clinical Study of TQB3912 Tablets in Patients With Advanced Malignant Tumor
This is a study to evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), occurrence of all adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), pharmacokinetic parameters and antitumor effect of TQB3912 tablets in Chinese adult patients with advanced malignant neoplasm. The study was divided into phase Ia and phase Ib, Phase Ia: Dose escalation period, to evaluate the safety and tolerability of TQB3912 tablets, determine MTD; Phase Ib: Effectiveness exploration period, to expand the safe and effective dose group, and to recommend appropriate dosage and method for subsequent clinical research.
