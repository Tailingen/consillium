Single Incision Laparoscopic Surgery in Treating Patients With Colorectal Disease
This study is being done to evaluate single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) for colorectal diseases, compared to multi-port laparoscopic surgery. This study is also intended to standardize the SILS technique for colorectal diseases

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To report the experience of SILS procedure in the treatment of colorectal disease.

II. To standardize the SILS technique.

OUTLINE:

Patients undergo single incision laparoscopic surgery with GelPortÂ® attachment.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2 weeks, 3 and 6 months, and at 1 year.
