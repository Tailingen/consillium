Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) will be defined as follows:

* Grade 4 non-hematologic toxicity of any duration including Grade 4 CRS and ICANS
* Grade 3 CRS that does not improve to a grade 2 or less in 72 hours following adequate therapy.
* Grade 3 neurological toxicity of any duration
* Grade 3 toxicity of any duration involving vital organs (cardiac, pulmonary). Exceptions can be made if associated with CRS.
* Other Grade 3 toxicity lasting \> 72 hours. Exceptions may be made for Grade 3 abnormal hepatic or renal function tests that improve to grade 2 or less within 7 days.
* Grade 3 hypersensitivity reaction that is not reversible to Grade 2 or less within 24 hours
* Grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia lasting more than 28 days, 24 months|Nature of Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT), Nature of Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) during the first 28 days after anti-BCMA CAR-T cell administration.

AEs with onset or worsening on or after date of first dose of study treatment. Severity scale ranges from Grade 1 (Mild) to Grade 5 (Death). Grade 1= Mild, Grade 2= Moderate, Grade 3= Severe, Grade 4= Life-threatening, and Grade 5= Death related to AE. SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that results in any of the following outcomes: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly/birth defect; suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal product or medically important., 24 months
Manufacture Success Rate (Feasibility), Defined as number of subjects treated with planned target dose divided by total number of subjects treated, and it is done to evaluate the feasibility of the manufacturing process, 24 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR), Defined by the proportion of subjects with the best overall response (BOR). It is the BOR of stringent complete response (sCR), Complete response (CR), VGPR (Very good partial response), and Partial response (PR) at month 3 and month 6 as determined using International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Criteria (Kumar et al, 2016)., 6 months|Complete Response Rate, Proportion of subjects with best overall response (BOR) of stringent complete response (sCR) or complete response (CR) at month 3 as determined by local investigator using International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Criteria (Kumar et al, 2016), 3 months|Duration of Response, Duration of response (DOR) to be assessed, and DOR defined as the time from achievement of stringent complete response (sCR), Complete response (CR), VGPR (Very good partial response), and Partial response (PR) to relapse or death due to multiple myeloma., 12 months from infusion of cellular product|Cmax of BCMA CAR-T Cells, Cmax of BCMA analyzed through qPCR-detected transgene of CAR-T concentrations over time in peripheral blood and bone marrow., 24 months|Tmax of BMCA CAR-T cells, Tmax of BCMA analyzed through qPCR-detected transgene of CAR-T concentrations over time in peripheral blood and bone marrow., 24 months|AUC of BCMA CAR-T cells, AUC of BCMA analyzed through qPCR-detected transgene of CAR-T concentrations over time in peripheral blood and bone marrow., 24 months|Clast of BCMA CAR-T cells, Clast of BCMA analyzed through qPCR-detected transgene of CAR-T concentrations over time in peripheral blood and bone marrow., 24 months|Number of patients with pre-existing and treatment induced immunogenicity of BMCA CAR-T, Both cellular and humoral of pre-existing and treatment induced immunogenicity for BCMA CAR-T cellular therapy in smoldering myeloma (SMM)., 24 months
This is a Phase II study to test the safety and effectiveness of study therapy cilta-cel in treating participants with high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM). T cells are a part of a person's immune system which usually helps fight infection and prevents/fights cancer cells.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved cilta-cel as a treatment for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma but not specifically for smoldering myeloma.

The research study procedures include screening for eligibility, study treatment including evaluations, blood collections, radiologic scans of tumors, bone marrow biopsies, and follow-up visits.

Participation in this study is expected to last about 15 years.

It is expected that about 20 people will take part in this research study.

This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational therapy to learn whether the therapy works in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the therapy is being studied.
