Assessment of Metabolic & Path Response w/ RCT & ImT Before Surgery in Locally Advanced Esoph and Gastro-esoph Jction CA
ARTemIS-Eso is a phase I-II, three-level, open-label trial with a dose-expansion cohort at recommended schedule in both esophageal cancer histological groups (squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma) of RCT and ImT administered prior to surgery.
Adenocarcinoma of the Esophagus|Adenocarcinoma of the Gastroesophageal Junction|Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Esophagus
DRUG: Monalizumab|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: 5-Fluorouracil|RADIATION: Metabolic|OTHER: Metabolic|PROCEDURE: Surgery
Phase I: determine the feasibility to administer monalizumab, Successful and safe administration of the combination of radio-chemotherapy and at least 2 doses of immunotherapy, From date of randomization until the date of first documented disease recurrence, assessed up to 28 months|Phase II: pCR rate, Defined by the absence of any tumoral cells on the surgical specimen post esophagectomy, At date of surgery, assessed at 16 weeks post randomization
Phase I: pCR rate, Defined by the absence of any tumoral cells on the surgical specimen post esophagectomy, At date of surgery, assessed at 16 weeks post randomization|Phase I: DFS and OS at 2 years after surgery, DFS and OS at 2 years after surgery, From date of randomization until the date of first documented event, assessed up to 28 months|Phase I: Human Anti-Human Antibodies against monalizumab (HAHA) in serum, Human Anti-Human Antibodies against monalizumab (HAHA) in serum, Week 5 to 3 months post surgery|Phase II: Two year-disease free survival (DFS) and two year-overall survival (OS), Two year-disease free survival (DFS) and two year-overall survival (OS), 2 years after the date the last patient had his surgery provided the trial objectives have been met|Phase II: Toxicity profile according to CTCAE v.4.03, Toxicity profile according to CTCAE v.4.03, From date of randomization until the date of first documented event, assessed up to 28 months|Phase II: Metabolic response after 1 course of CT and before surgery, Metabolic response after 1 course of CT and before surgery, from week 1 up to the time of surgery|Phase II: Number of the tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), Number of the tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), at baseline, after 1 course of CT at week 3 and after surgery at 16 weeks
This study is indicated to patients with adenocarcinomas of the esophagus or gastro-esophageal junction and squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus.

The study consists of 2 parts:

Phase I of the study is composed of the 3 following levels, corresponding to changes in the schedule and the number of administrations of monalizumab:

Level 1: monalizumab (ImT) administration starts 2 weeks after the end of RCT (Total of 3 ImT doses). A maximum of 7 days delay is allowed.

Level 2: monalizumab administration starts directly at the end of RCT (Total of 4 ImT doses). The first dose of monalizumab should be given on the following working day after the last radiotherapy administration.

Level 3: monalizumab administration starts 2 weeks after the start of RCT (total of 6 ImT doses). A maximum of 7 days delay is allowed.

Phase II (Expansion cohort): At the recommended level determined in phase I and according to the number of patients already accrued, approximately 48-51 additional patients (half-SCC and half-ADC) are included with the aim of assessing the activity of the recommended combination.
