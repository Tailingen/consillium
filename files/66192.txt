A Study Comparing the Effectiveness of EndoRotor Versus Radiofrequency in Treating Barrett's Esophagus
Barrett Esophagus is a common pathology, with an estimated prevalence of 1.6% at risk of progression to precancerous mucosa (low to high grade dysplasia). The incidence of adenocarcinoma on BE is 0.5% per year. In the event of dysplasia or cancer in situ, it is currently recommended at international and particularly European level to eradicate BE. The treatment techniques used to date carry out thermal destruction of the BE, in particular by radiofrequency. Eradication of dysplasia is achieved in 81% to 100% and disappearance of BE in 73% to 87% of cases. It requires an average of 3 destruction sessions. RF does not allow histological analysis after destruction of BE, but the risk of progression to neoplasia is estimated at 7.8/1000 persons per year. This risk could be due to the presence of glands buried in the esophageal mucosa. Indeed, these glands are not destroyed by thermal ablation methods, and remain invisible during endoscopic controls.

A new treatment technique using the Endorotor® system allows mechanical resection of the entire mucosa in one session of treatment. In addition, the cost of these thermal destruction techniques currently limits their wider diffusion. It is therefore legitimate to propose a less expensive and probably more effective alternative technique.
