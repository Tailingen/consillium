This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1/1b study of RMC-9805, a selective and orally bioavailable KRAS G12D(ON) inhibitor, in subjects with KRASG12D-mutant solid tumors to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary clinical activity. The study consists of two arms: RMC-9805 monotherapy arm and RMC-9805 plus RMC-6236 combination arm. Both arms consist of two parts: Part 1- dose exploration and Part 2- dose expansion.
