A RCT on the Preventive Effect of HFNC on Postoperative Pulmonary Complications in Patients With Gynecologic Neoplasms
Patients at high risk of post-operative pulmonary complications (PPC) will be screened out from gynecological tumor patients undergoing surgical treatment, and randomly assigned into the HFNC group and control group, which uses conventional nasal cannula oxygen therapy. The primary outcome is the incidence of PPC, including postoperative hypoxemia, atelectasis, pneumonia, etc. Secondary outcomes are the improvement of postoperative oxygenation, antibiotic use, length of hospital stay, adverse events related to oxygen therapy, etc.
Gynecologic Surgery|High-flow Nasal Cannula|Post-operative Pulmonary Complications
DEVICE: heated humidified high flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy, HFNC|DEVICE: Nasal cannula oxygen
Postoperative pulmonary complication, The primary outcome measures were the incidence of PPC in the treatment group and the control group, including the incidence of postoperative hypoxemia, atelectasis, pneumonia, etc., 7 days after the surgery
Total Hospitalization days, Postoperative Hospitalization Days and ICU Stay Days, 7 days after the surgery|Oxygen therapy, The Need for Oxygen Therapy, 2 days after the surgery|Antibiotics, The use of antibiotics, including the type, usage, use time, etc., 7 days after the surgery|Postoperative oxygenation, Improvement of Postoperative Oxygenation, 2 days after the surgery|Adverse events, Adverse events Associated with Oxygen Therapy, 2 days after the surgery
This randomized con aims to enroll patients at high risk of developing post-operative pulmonary complications after gynecological surgery, the eligible patients will be randomly assigned to receive oxygen therapy via high-flow nasal cannula or conventional nasal cannula. The study primary outcome is the incidence of post-operative pulmonary complications, including postoperative hypoxemia, atelectasis, pneumonia, etc. Secondary outcomes are the improvement of postoperative oxygenation, antibiotic use, length of hospital stay, adverse events related to oxygen therapy, etc.
