Retrospective Study on Referral Patterns for High Risk Patients Post Nephrectomy
This study aims at estimating the proportion of patients diagnosed with locoregional renal cell carcinoma who are at high risk for recurrence following nephrectomy, describe referral patterns, and characterize treatment in this population. Outcomes including estimation of the incidence of recurrence and disease-free interval following nephrectomy will be reported overall and among the subgroup off patients receiving adjuvant systemic therapy with sunitinib following nephrectomy.
