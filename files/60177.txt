BGJ398 for Patients With Tumors With FGFR Genetic Alterations
The purpose of this signal seeking study was to determine whether treatment with BGJ398 demonstrates sufficient efficacy in select FGFR pathway-regulated solid tumors and/or hematologic malignancies to warrant further study.
Solid Tumor|Hematologic Malignancies
DRUG: BGJ398
Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) Associated With BGJ398 Treatment, Tumor Response: Overall response rate (ORR) and clinical benefit rate (CBR) for solid tumor (non-lymphoma) which excludes 3 TIO and 1 Lymphoma patients (hence 80 patients and not 84)

Clinical benefit rate for patients with solid tumors were assessed using RECIST 1.1 and include responses of CR or PR or SD. For hematologic tumors other appropriate hematological response criteria may apply

Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR, 16 weeks
Overall Response (OR) or Partial Response (PR) or Greater, The key secondary endpoint, OR, was determined by Investigator assessment for each tumor assessment and defined as responses of CR and PR per RECIST version 1.1.

Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR, baseline and every 8 weeks until disease progression or end of treatment, assessed up to 24 months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Kaplan-Meier estimates of PFS timing, months

Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the date of first dose to the date of first documented disease progression or relapse or death due to any cause, every 8 weeks until death, assessed up to 24 months|Kaplan-Meier Estimates of PFS Rate, % (95% CI), Months 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 18, 24|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from the date of first dose to the date of death due to any cause, every 8 weeks until death, assessed up to 36 months|Kaplan-Meier Estimates of Survival Rate, % (95% CI), Overall survival (OS) is the time from the date of start of treatment to date of death due to any cause. If a patient was not known to have died, survival was censored at the date of last contact., months 3, 6, 9, 12, 24|Number of Participants With 99 Day Minimum Duration of Response (DOR), The duration of response (PR or greater) applies only to patients whose best response was PR or greater. It is defined as the Ttime from the first documented response to the date first documented disease progression or relapse or death due to any cause, baseline and every 8 weeks until disease progression or end of treatment, assessed up to 24 months
