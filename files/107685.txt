A Study of AK112, a PD-1/VEGF Bispecific Antibody, for Advanced Solid Tumors
This study is to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, pharmacodynamics (PD) and anti-tumor activity of AK112, a PD-1/VEGF bispecific antibody, as a single agent in adult subjects with advanced solid tumor malignancies. The study consists of a dose escalation phase (Phase 1a) to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for AK112 as a single agent, and a dose expansion phase (Phase 1b) in subjects with specific tumor types which will characterize treatment of AK112 as a single agent at the MTD or RP2D.
Neoplasms Malignant
DRUG: AK112
Incidence and nature of participants with adverse events (AEs), An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment., From time ICF is signed until 90 days after last dose of AK112|Number of participants with DLTs, DLTs will be assessed during the dose-escalation phase and are defined as toxicities that meet pre-defined severity criteria and assessed as having a suspected relationship to study drug, and unrelated to disease, disease progression, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medications that occurs within the first cycle (4 weeks) of treatment., During the first four weeks of treatment with AK112
Objective response rate (ORR), The ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects with confirmed CR or confirmed PR, based on RECIST Version 1.1., Up to 2 years|Disease control rate (DCR), The DCR is defined as the proportion of subjects with CR, PR, or SD (subjects achieving SD will be included in the DCR if they maintain SD at 16 and 24 weeks respectively) based on RECIST Version 1.1., Up to 2 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival is defined as the time from the start of treatment with AK112 until the first documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 2 years|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the time from the start of treatment with AK112 until death due to any cause., Up to 2 years|Area under the curve (AUC) of AK112 for assessment of pharmacokinetics, The endpoints for assessment of PK of AK112 include serum concentrations of AK112 at different timepoints after AK112 administration., From first dose of AK112 through 90 days after last dose of AK112|Maximum observed concentration (Cmax) and Minimum observed concentration (Cmin) of AK112, The endpoints for assessment of PK of AK112 include serum concentrations of AK112 at different timepoints after AK112 administration., From first dose of AK112 through 90 days after last dose of AK112|Number of subjects who develop detectable anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), The immunogenicity of AK112 will be assessed by summarizing the number of subjects who develop detectable anti-drug antibodies (ADAs)., From first dose of AK112 through 90 days after last dose of AK112
