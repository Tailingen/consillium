Breast-Conserving Surgery Followed by Radiation Therapy With MRI-Detected Stage I or Stage II Breast Cancer
RATIONALE: Breast-conserving surgery is a less invasive type of surgery for breast cancer and may have fewer side effects and improve recovery. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving radiation therapy after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.

PURPOSE: This phase II clinical trial is studying how well breast-conserving surgery followed by radiation therapy works in treating patients with stage I or stage II breast cancer.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence rates as well as tumor bed recurrence rates. Patients will be followed for a period of five years following completion of radiation to determine these rates.

II. To determine the cosmetic outcome resulting from breast conserving surgery and breast radiation.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine if there are patient factors which limit a patient's suitability to receive breast conserving therapy in the setting of multi-centric disease.

II. To determine patient satisfaction of breast conserving therapy as it pertains to their overall treatment experience as measured by a questionnaire.

III. To evaluate wound healing and overall complication rate after radiation as a component of breast conserving therapy.

OUTLINE:

Patients undergo breast-conserving surgery consisting of partial mastectomies followed by external beam breast radiation therapy 5 days a week for 5 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 month, then every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually for 5 years.
