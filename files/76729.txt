A Study of SGN-ALPV in Advanced Solid Tumors
This study will test the safety of a drug called SGN-ALPV in participants with solid tumors. It will also study the side effects of this drug. A side effect is anything a drug does to your body besides treating your disease.

Participants will have solid tumor cancer that has spread through the body (metastatic) or cannot be removed with surgery (unresectable).

This study will have three parts. Parts A and B of the study will find out how much SGN-ALPV should be given to participants. Part C will use the dose and schedule found in Parts A and B to find out how safe SGN-ALPV is and if it works to treat solid tumor cancers.
