Humanized 3F8 Monoclonal Antibody (Hu3F8) in Patients With High-Risk Neuroblastoma and GD2-Positive Tumors
The purpose of this study is to find out if "humanized 3F8" (Hu3F8) is safe for treating neuroblastoma and other cancers. A phase 1 study means the investigators are trying to find out what side effects happen when higher and higher doses of a drug are used.

The investigators want to find out what effects, good and/or bad, Hu3F8 has on cancer. The amount of Hu3F8 that patients gets will depend on when they start treatment on this study. The investigators also want to find out more about how Hu3F8 works and how effective it is in attacking the disease. Hu3F8 is an experimental drug, which means it has not yet been approved by the FDA for the treatment of this disease.

maximum tolerated dosage (MTD), At least 3 patients will be studied at each dosage level and dose escalations will only be carried out if 0/3 or \< or = to 1/6 patients have dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). At least six patients will be studied at the maximum tolerated dosage (MTD)., 2 years
pharmacokinetics of hu3F8, Pharmacokinetics will be measured by serial blood sampling following the iv doses of hu3F8 during cycle 1. Serum hu3F8 will be measured at the following times after infusion of the first hu3F8 infusion during the first cycle: 0, 5 min, 3h, 6-8h, 24h, 48h, 72h, 96, 120h 168h, 216h and 264 h and will also include peak hu3F8 level after infusion for each of the two hu3F8 injections during the first cycle. Peak hu3F8 level at 5 minutes after hu3F8 infusion on days 3 and 5. Pre-treatment and at 5 min after infusion will also be measured for all hu3F8 infusions during all other cycles., 2 years|To assess activity of hu3F8 against NB and other GD2-positive tumors., For neuroblastoma, anti-tumor activity will be measured by INRC.61 For other solid tumors, the response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Committee, version 1.1.62, 2 years|To quantitate pain during hu3F8 treatment, As patient's pain will be assessed with a numerical score of 1 to 10 over the course of the treatment, a curve of pain intensity over time can be generated for each patient., 2 years
Patients can be treated on 2 different schedules:

For patients following a 2 doses/cycle schedule (patients who were enrolled and started treatment prior to Amendment A(8)), one cycle has 2 days of intravenous hu3F8 treatment, given approximately 7 days apart.

For patients following a 3 doses/cycle schedule, one cycle has 3 days of intravenous hu3F8 treatment, given on days 1, 3 and 5. After Cycle 1, patients may receive treatment on a modified schedule of 3 days of intravenous hu3F8 over 10 days, as needed. To limit side-effects, patients receive analgesics and antihistamines as premedications. Cycles are 21 days and can be repeated up to a total of 12 cycles, see section 9.1 for details. Evaluations before, during and after treatment are summarized in Tables 4A and B. In addition, to further study the side effect of pain, patients will be asked to assess their pain on the days of treatment with hu3F8 at 3 different time points: (a) prior to commencement of hu3F8, (b) at least once during the acute pain episode when rescue pain medication doses are usually required and (c) prior to discharge from the Pediatric Day Hospital.
