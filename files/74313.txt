A Study of Trastuzumab Emtansine (T-DM1) Sequentially With Anthracycline-based Chemotherapy, as Adjuvant or Neoadjuvant Therapy for Patients With Early Stage Herceptin (HER)2-positive Breast Cancer
This single-arm open-label study assessed the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) after the completion of anthracycline-based adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with early HER2-positive breast cancer. Patients received T-DM1 3.6 mg/kg intravenously on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle, for up to 17 cycles.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Trastuzumab emtansine
Percentage of Participants With a Cardiac Event Within 12 Weeks After the Start of Trastuzumab Emtansine Treatment, A cardiac event was defined as death from a cardiac cause or severe congestive failure (New York Heart Association \[NYHA\] Class III or IV) with a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of ≥ 10% from Baseline to an LVEF of \< 50%., Baseline to 12 weeks after the start of trastuzumab emtansine treatment|Adverse Events, LVEF Function, and Deaths, The following percentages of participants are reported: At least 1 adverse event while receiving T-DM1; at least 1 serious adverse event while receiving T-DM1; an adverse event leading to discontinuation, dose delay, or dose reduction of trastuzumab emtansine treatment; symptomatic cardiac dysfunction; and asymptomatic decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). An asymptomatic LVEF decline was defined as a LVEF \< 50% and a maximum decrease ≥ 10% from Baseline. The percentage of participants who died is reported., From the start to the end of trastuzumab emtansine treatment (up to 51 weeks)
Percentage of Participants Who Experienced at Least 1 Adverse Event During Concurrent Radiotherapy With Trastuzumab Emtansine Treatment, From the start to the end of concurrent radiotherapy (up to 51 weeks)|Percentage of Participants Who Experienced at Least 1 Adverse Event During Concurrent Hormonal Therapy With Trastuzumab Emtansine Treatment, From the start to the end of concurrent hormonal therapy (up to 51 weeks)|Percentage of Participants Who Completed the Planned Duration of Trastuzumab Emtansine Treatment, Participants were to receive up to a total of 17 cycles of trastuzumab emtansine. If trastuzumab was given concurrently with either the optional docetaxel or optional radiation, then the number of 3-week cycles of trastuzumab therapy was subtracted from the planned 17 cycles of trastuzumab emtansine therapy., From the start to the end of trastuzumab emtansine treatment (up to 51 weeks)|Percentage of Participants Who Completed ≥ 95% of the Planned Radiotherapy Treatment With Concurrent Trastuzumab Emtansine Administration Without Significant (> 5 Days) Delay, From the start to the end of radiotherapy treatment (up to 51 weeks)|Percentage of Participants With a Pathological Complete Response, Pathological complete response was defined as the absence of invasive neoplastic cells at microscopic examination of the primary tumor and lymph nodes after surgery following primary systemic therapy. Pathological complete response was evaluated in participants treated with neoadjuvant therapy doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide-5-fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide followed by 1 or more doses of trastuzumab emtansine and who underwent surgery., Day of surgery|Disease-free Survival at Month 12, Disease-free survival was defined as the time from date of first protocol treatment for adjuvant patients or date of surgery for neoadjuvant patients to disease recurrence, occurrence of invasive contralateral breast cancer, other second primary cancer (excluding non-breast second primary), or death, whichever occurred first., From the start of trastuzumab emtansine for adjuvant patients and from the date of surgery for neoadjuvant patients to 12 months later
