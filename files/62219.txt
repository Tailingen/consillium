Hypofractionated Chemoradiotherapy and Thymosin α1 in Unresectable or Recurrent Thymic Epithelial Tumor
This phase II study was to assess the efficacy and toxicity of hypofractionated radiotherapy (HRT) combined with weekly docetaxel/platinum and thymosin α1 in patients with unresectable or recurrent thymic epithelia tumors (TETs).
Thymoma and Thymic Carcinoma
DRUG: Thymosin a1|RADIATION: hypofractionated radiotherapy|DRUG: concurrent chemoradiotherapy
Progression-Free Survival, 2 years
Quality of Life score, EORTC QLQ-C30 (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer) core questionnaire, 1 year|Overall Survival, 2 years
HRT using the IMRT technique was administered. For patients with limited pulmonary or pleural metastases (≤3 lesions), stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) could be used.

All patients received weekly docetaxel(25mg/㎡) and nedaplatin or cisplatin (25mg/㎡), each of 1 day's duration, concurrently with hypofractionated radiotherapy .

Meanwhile they received weekly thymosin a1(1.6mg) during and within 2 months after the end of chemoradiotherapy.
