Neladalkib (NVL-655) for TKI-naive Patients With Advanced ALK-Positive NSCLC
Multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label, Phase 3 study designed to demonstrate that neladalkib (NVL-655) is superior to alectinib in prolonging progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with treatment-na√Øve, Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) positive, advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).

Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio (approximately 225 in each arm) to receive either neladalkib (NVL-655) or alectinib.
