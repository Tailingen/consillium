Bile Acids in Acute Insulin Resistance
This is a prospective observational study with a primary goal of monitoring changes in circulating bile acid profiles and parameters of glucose and lipid metabolism prior, during, and after cancer treatment with agents that directly impair insulin action: PI3K inhibitors, AKT inhibitors, and mTOR inhibitors. Patients will not receive any cancer treatment specifically for the purposes of this study. Rather, this study will be based on treatment decisions made independently by participants' oncologists according to standard of care or other clinical trial protocol. This study seeks to enroll at least 25 participants each for PI3K inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors and, once available for open-label treatment, AKT inhibitors.

Ratio of 12-HBA to non-12-HBA, Insulin resistance is expected to cause a rise in total bile acids, but with 12-alpha-hydroxylated bile acid (12-HBA) species outpacing non-12-alpha-hydroxylated bile acid (non-12-HBA) species, leading to a rise in the 12-HBA:non-12-HBA ratio. This would indicate that insulin resistance per se is sufficient to alter 12-HBA balance, and thus 12-HBA may be a useful therapeutic target for management of the macrovascular complications of insulin resistance. BA profile and levels of BA intermediates 7-HCO and 7,12-diHCO will be measured by LC-MS/MS when fasting +/- after 2-hour mixed meal tolerance test., 1-2 Months|Insulin resistance, Determine the timing and extent of PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitor treatment on parameters of insulin resistance: glucose, insulin, c-peptide, and adiponectin when fasting +/- following 2-hour mixed meal tolerance test, 1-2 months
Lipid profile, The primary endpoint is the outcome of the secondary objective: namely, evaluation of the effect of PI3Ki/AKTi/mTORi-induced insulin resistance on the lipid profile (total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids) when fasting +/- after 2-hour mixed meal tolerance test, 1-2 months|Surrogate markers of BA signaling, Determine the timing and extent of PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitor treatment on parameters of bile acid signaling: fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF-19) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). We expect that a shift in BA pool composition (especially as regards 12-HBA vs non-12-HBA) will impact differentially on FGF-19 and GLP-1 levels., 1-2 months
The primary objective of this study is to determine the effect of drug-induced acute insulin resistance (diaIR) on the ratio of 12α-hydroxylated bile acids (12-HBA) to 12α-hydroxylated bile acids (non-12-HBA) in cancer patients treated with phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate kinase (PI3K) inhibitors (PI3Ki), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors (mTORi), and AKT inhibitors (AKTi) once possible. Specifically, this study will: (1) verify the induction of diaIR by monitoring changes in fasting ± postprandial blood glucose, insulin/c-peptide, and fructosamine; and (2) assess qualitative and quantitative changes in the circulating bile acid (BA) pool (including bile acid intermediary metabolites) by mass spectrometry in the fasting ± postprandial states prior to and then at 2 and 4 weeks after starting treatment. This study focuses in particular on determining changes in the 12α-hydroxylated bile acids to 12α-hydroxylated bile acids, as well as each of these subclasses and their individual substituents as a proportion of the overall BA pool.
