Get REAL and HEEL Research Program
The UNC Get REAL \& HEEL (GR\&H) program has provided after treatment support for women with a breast cancer diagnosis since 2006. The 16-week program includes an individualized training program and the opportunity to continue working out in the GR\&H facilities at the conclusion of the 16-week program. The purpose of this protocol is to implement a research agenda at GR\&H that will examine the efficacy of the program. The primary aim of this study is a pre-post test of the impact of the GR\&H program (standardized combination of aerobic and resistance training) on VO2peak1,2. The secondary aims of this study are to evaluate quality of life as well as cardiorespiratory function (vascular health), physical function (muscular strength, body composition), cognition, balance, and patient-reported outcomes (fatigue, depression, anxiety, quality of life). Exploratory aims are focused on evaluating the impact of exercise on biomarkers: (1) aging - p16INK4a, (2) immune cell function - total leukocyte count, T and natural killer cells, monocytes, and neutrophils count and activity, and (3) circulating pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines.

Total body weight-mass (BW) and compositional aspects of lean body mass (LBM), fat tissue mass (FM), and percentage body fat (% BF) will be examined using standard DEXA screening procedures. The BW will be measured using a high grade analytical balance-scale (accuracy ± 10 grams)., Pre-intervention (weeks 1-2), post-intervention (weeks 17 or 18), 6 months post-intervention, 12 months post-intervention|Measure of muscle composition -- proportion of body fat to lean muscle mass, Ultrasound -- LogicView™ software (General Electric Company, Milwaukee, WI, USA) will be used to generate real-time panoramic cross-sectional images of the VL. Three panoramic scans at a gain of 50dB and a depth of 5.0 cm. All image analyses will be completed using Image-J software (version 1.46r, National Institutes of Health, USA) with each image area individually scaled from pixels to centimeters via the straight-line function. The polygon function will be used to determine the CSA of the VL by selecting a region including mostly muscle and minimal surrounding fascia. Greater EI values represent greater fibrous (non-muscular) composition., Pre-intervention (weeks 1-2), post-intervention (weeks 17 or 18), 6-months post-intervention, 12-months post-intervention|Vascular Function, XCEL Sphygmacor+USCOM, Pre-intervention (weeks 1-2), post-intervention (weeks 17 or 18), 6-months post-intervention, 12-months post-intervention|Resting ECG, Resting electrocardiogram -- Individual wave/complex/intervals components and overall ECG tracings will be assessed using a 12-lead ECG.

Objectives:

Primary:

Evaluate the impact of the Get REAL and HEEL research program (standardized combination of aerobic and resistance training) on change in V02peak from pre to post 16-week intervention.

Secondary:

Evaluate the impact of the GR\&H program (standardized combination of aerobic and resistance training) on change in cardiorespiratory function, immunology, physical function parameters, cognition, balance, and patient-reported outcomes from pre to post 16-week intervention.

Evaluate changes in all measures annually over the 5 year follow-up period.

Report on enrollment, recruitment, and attrition.

Exploratory Objectives

The investigator's exploratory aims are focused on evaluating the impact of exercise on biomarkers: (1) aging - p16INK4a, (2) total leukocyte, lymphocyte (T cells and natural killer cells), monocyte and neutrophil counts and T cell proliferation assays, natural killer cytotoxicity assays, and cytokine production from stimulated neutrophils and monocytes, and (3) circulating pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines.

OUTLINE:

Participants will complete pre-intervention assessments, questionnaires and blood draw at week 1 and 2 pre-intervention, followed by a 16-week aerobic and resistance training exercise program (intervention). Participants will complete assessments, questionnaires and blood draws at week 1 and 2 following the intervention and then again at 6 months and 12 months following intervention. Questionnaires only will be administered at year 2, 3,4 and 5 following intervention.
