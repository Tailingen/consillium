TK216 in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Ewing Sarcoma
Ewing sarcoma is characterized by genomic rearrangements resulting in over-expression of ets family transcription factors driving tumor progression. TK216 is designed to inhibit this effect by inhibiting downstream effects of the EWS-FLI1 transcription factor. This study is a first in human study of TK216 in subjects with Ewing sarcoma. The study is designed to establish initial safety and efficacy data in monotherapy and in combination with vincristine to assess the potential of TK216 for further development.
Sarcoma, Ewing
DRUG: TK216
Overall Response Rate, Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions and pathologic lymph nodes; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, no new lesions, and no progression of non-target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., 36 months
The study has been expanded to explore single agent TK216 for longer treatment duration. Approximately 26 patients will be enrolled in this Cohort.

Please note: This study has been terminated and is no longer enrolling patients.
