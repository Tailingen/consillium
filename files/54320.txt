Clinical Study of Neoadjuvant Targeted Therapy for Ameloblastoma
This study aims to evaluate the tumor shrinkage effect of preoperative targeted induction therapy with dabrafenib and trametinib in patients with conventional ameloblastoma harboring the BRAF V600E mutation. The study will assess the proportion of cases where mandibular continuity cannot be preserved that can be converted to cases where mandibular continuity is preserved, as well as the proportion of cases where complete resection is initially not feasible that become resectable.
Ameloblastoma|BRAF V600E Mutation Positive
DRUG: Dabrafenib|DRUG: Trametinib
Proportion of Patients Eligible for Mandibular Continuity-Preserving Surgery, The proportion of patients initially requiring mandibular segmental resection who become eligible for mandibular continuity-preserving surgery after preoperative targeted induction therapy with dabrafenib and trametinib., After completion of two 30-day cycles of therapy (approximately 2 months)|Proportion of Non-radical Resectable Cases Becoming Resectable, The proportion of patients initially deemed non-radical resectable who become resectable after completing two cycles of preoperative targeted induction therapy with dabrafenib and trametinib., After completion of two 30-day cycles of therapy (approximately 2 months)
Radiological Response, The evaluation of tumor response using radiological studies such as MRI or CT scans after preoperative targeted induction therapy with dabrafenib and trametinib., After completion of two 30-day cycles of therapy (approximately 2 months)|Pathological Response, The assessment of tumor pathological changes after preoperative targeted induction therapy with dabrafenib and trametinib, based on biopsy or surgical specimens., After completion of two 30-day cycles of therapy (approximately 2 months)|Local Recurrence-Free Survival (LRFS), The time from the start of treatment to the occurrence of local recurrence or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., 3 months|Adverse Effects and Safety, The incidence and severity of adverse effects related to the combination therapy with dabrafenib and trametinib, assessed using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0., Throughout the study period, up to 12 months
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

Ⅰ. To observe the proportion of patients with ameloblastoma requiring mandibular segmental resection at initial diagnosis who can convert to mandibular preservation surgery after preoperative induction therapy with dabrafenib and trametinib.

Ⅱ.To observe the proportion of cases initially deemed non-radical resectable Surgery that become resectable

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

Ⅰ. Radiological response Ⅱ. Pathological response Ⅲ. Local recurrence-free survival(LRFS) Ⅳ.Feasibility and safety in this patient population

OUTLINE:

Dabrafenib:

Dosage: 150 mg twice daily (total daily dose of 300 mg). Administration: Must be taken in combination with trametinib until disease progression or intolerable toxicity occurs. Administer at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal, with approximately 12 hours between doses. Take at the same time each day. If a dose is missed and less than 6 hours remain until the next dose, the missed dose should not be taken. When used in combination with trametinib, take trametinib once daily at the same time as the morning or evening dose of dabrafenib. Do not open, crush, or break the capsules.

Trametinib:

Dosage: 2 mg once daily orally, in combination with dabrafenib, until disease progression or intolerable toxicity occurs.

Administration: Administer at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal. Take at the same time each day. If a dose is missed, it should be taken no later than 12 hours before the next scheduled dose. If less than 12 hours remain until the next dose, the missed dose should not be taken. When used in combination with dabrafenib, take trametinib once daily at the same time as the morning or evening dose of dabrafenib. Do not chew or crush the tablets.

Treatment Cycle:

Cycle Length: Each cycle lasts 30 days. Initial Follow-Up: Follow-up after each of the first two cycles with a consultation, physical examination, imaging studies, and relevant laboratory tests to evaluate drug toxicity, safety, and tumor shrinkage rate.

Adjustment and Transition to Surgery:

Toxicity Management: If intolerable drug toxicity or adverse reactions occur that cannot be managed by dose adjustment, discontinue treatment immediately and switch to traditional surgical treatment.

Post Two-Cycles Evaluation: After the first two cycles, if intolerable adverse reactions persist or the tumor continues to progress despite dose adjustments, switch to traditional surgical treatment. If the tumor does not progress, continue long-term medication.

Long-Term Treatment Follow-Up:

Follow-Up Schedule: Conduct follow-up evaluations every two cycles, including consultations, physical examinations, imaging studies, and relevant laboratory tests to evaluate drug toxicity, safety, and tumor shrinkage rate.

Criteria for Surgery: If tumor shrinkage reaches a plateau or the patient meets the criteria for mandibular preservation surgery, and the surgical plan is confirmed independently by at least two chief physicians in the department, record this in the case report form and discontinue the medication in preparation for scheduled surgery.
