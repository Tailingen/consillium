HA-WBRT vs SRS in Patients With Multiple Brain Metastases
This study compares the effectiveness and safety of two radiation treatment techniques for patients with multiple brain metastases.
Brain Metastases
RADIATION: Hippocampal Avoiding Whole Brain Radiation Therapy with Simultaneous Integrated Boost|RADIATION: Single session or hypofractionated stereotactic radiosurgery
Intracranial Progression free survival, survival with freedom from both local and distant intracranial progression, measured in months from end of treatment until progression or death, assessed in follow-up imaging (MRI, FET-PET), up to 18 months
Neurocognitive function assessed by VLMT, Change of z-scores of VLMT (Verbaler Lern- und Merkf√§higkeitstest) to baseline examination, up to 18 months|Neurocognitive function assessed by COWAT, Change of z-scores of COWAT (controlled oral word association test) to baseline examination, up to 18 months|Neurocognitive function assessed by TMT, Change of z-scores of TMT (trail making test) to baseline examination, up to 18 months|Local control rate, rate of progression of treated metastases assessed in follow-up imaging (MRI, FET-PET), up to 18 months|Survival time, time from end of treatment to death, up to 18 months|Quality of Life Score assessed by EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire, Change in Quality of Life Score of EORTC QLQ-C30 (Quality of life core module) relative to baseline, up to 18 months|Quality of Life Score assessed by QLQ-BN20 questionnaire, Change in Quality of Life Score of QLQ-BN20 (quality of life brain cancer module) relative to baseline, up to 18 months
For patients suffering from multiple brain metastases whole brain radiation therapy still constitutes a standard therapy. However, because of the risk of neurocognitive side effects as well as reduced local tumor control, employment of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is becoming more common. The disadvantage of SRS alone may be poor intracranial tumor control because of frequent appearance of new distant brain metastases after therapy. In recent years hippocampal avoidance whole brain therapy has been shown to minimize treatment related side effects while reducing the rate of distant intracranial failure.

In this study patients will be randomized to receive either hippocampal avoidance whole brain radiation therapy with integrated tumor boost (HA-WBRT+SIB) or stereotactic radiosurgery. The investigators hypothesize that HA-WBRT+SIB can improve intracranial tumor control compared to stereotactic radiosurgery, while avoiding additional neurocognitive side effects.
