Precision-Panc Master Protocol: Personalising Treatment for Pancreatic Cancer
The Precision-Panc Master Protocol is a "portal" protocol for patients with known or suspected pancreatic cancer to be accrued through multiple centres in the UK, with the option of being subsequently enrolled into PRIMUS (Pancreatic canceR Individualised Multi-arm Umbrella Studies) examining different treatment regimens and/or biomarker development. Eligible patients will undergo tumour biopsy and blood collection prospectively for molecular profiling at a central laboratory and the results may be used to inform enrolment to PRIMUS studies.
Neoplasms Pancreatic
OTHER: Patients with suspected or confirmed pancreatic cancer will be be asked to provide biopsy material for molecular profiling
Proving that patients with pancreatic cancer can have their tissue molecularly assessed and be followed up in a clinical trial setting, The number of patients screened and registered to the master protocol will be recorded. The number of patients who we are able to molecular assess will be recorded and all patients will be followed up in the master protocol until death., At end of study (5 years)
Overall Survival, To assess the overall survival (OS) in patients enrolled in Precision-Panc and relate this to molecular profile information., From date of registration until date of death from any cause, assessed up to 5 years|Number of participants with biopsy related adverse events as assesed by CTCAE v4.03, To assess the safety of obtaining tumour biopsies suitable for molecular profiling within a standard patient treatment pathway., At time of biopsy, usually within one week of screening
Progression Free Survival, To assess the progression-free survival (PFS) in patients enrolled in Precision-Panc and relate this to molecular profile information, At time of progression (this is estimated at around 6-9 months for this group of patients)
