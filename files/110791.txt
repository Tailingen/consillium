Seal-G / Seal-G MIST Study
A prospective, multi-center, open label, study to evaluate safety and performance of Seal-G and Seal-G MIST in reinforcing colonic anastomosis, in subjects undergoing Colon Resection surgery
Colon Cancer|Gastrointestinal Cancer
DEVICE: Seal-G Surgical Sealant|DEVICE: Seal-G MIST System
Proportion of surgeries with full sealant coverage - successful application, 1- The surgeon applied the sealant over the full circumference of the anastomosis (successful application).

0 - The surgeon did not fully cover the anastomosis circumference, At time of surgery
Proportion of subjects with clinical anastomotic leaks, 1 - The subject had a clinical anastomotic leak 0 - The subject did not have a clinical anastomotic leak, Up to 30 days post-surgery|Proportion of subjects with subclinical / radiological leaks, 1 - The subject had a Subclinical /radiological anastomotic leak 0 - The subject did not have a Subclinical /radiological anastomotic leak, Up to 30 days post-surgery|Proportion of subjects with at least one Serious Adverse Event, 1 - The subject had any Serious adverse event 0 - The subject did not have Serious adverse event, Up to 30 days post-surgery|Proportion of subjects that had a reoperation, 1 - The subject had any event of reoperation 0 - The subject did not have reoperation, Up to 30 days post-surgery|Hospital length of stay, Measured by the time for "Ready to be discharged" (in days), Up to 30 days post-surgery
Seal-G and Seal-G MIST Surgical Sealants are intended for the reinforcement and protection of gastrointestinal anastomosis. The Seal-G and Seal-G MIST devices share the same Alginate based sealant technology and intended purpose. The devices only differ in their method of application, The Seal-G device is designed for spread application by extra-corporal approach, and the Seal-G MIST device is designed for spray application by intra-corporal approach.

The proposed Clinical Investigation aims to collect clinical evidence on the devices' usage, including safety, performance and usability.
