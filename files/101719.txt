Characterization of Human Autoantibody Titers After Central Nervous System Insult
The aim of the study is to quantitate Central Nervous System (CNS) autoantibody development in human blood using ELISA after human brain injury, spinal cord injury, and intra-axial brain surgeries.

Study Objectives:

We aim to:

1. Quantitate CNS autoantibody development in human blood using ELISA after human brain injury, spinal cord injury, and intra-axial brain surgeries. We also aim to characterize the temporal course of this response.
2. Characterize how CNS autoantibody levels correlate with specific injury patterns as well as radiographic and clinical measures of injury severity.
3. Determine how intercurrent infection and a history of prior CNS insult affects the temporal course and magnitude of autoantibody production.
