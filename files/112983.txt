MRI and CT in Gastroesophageal Junction or Upper Gastric Adenocarcinoma
Accurate preoperative Siewert classification, precise assessment of the extent of esophageal involvement, and staging is crucial for determining the appropriate surgical approach and achieving negative resection margins. The purpose of this study is to investigate the diagnostic performance of the Multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) and computed tomography (CT) in gastroesophageal junction and upper gastric cancers.

Despite a continuous decline in the incidence of gastric cancer in recent years, the morbidity and mortality rates associated with the gastroesophageal junction and upper gastric cancers remain elevated. Consequently, it is imperative to develop more refined and individualized precision strategies for screening, diagnosis, surgical intervention, and comprehensive treatment. Due to the unique anatomical location, considerable debate exists regarding the critical aspects of its surgical management in clinical practice. Multiparametric MRI offers significant anatomical benefits due to its high soft tissue resolution, and its functional imaging capabilities present promising applications. With advancements in abdominal imaging technology, novel techniques such as high-order diffusion imaging and compressed sensing technology have facilitated high-resolution MRI of the stomach during free breathing, which is now implemented in clinical practice. Prior research has demonstrated that individualized gastric MRI scanning consistently yields superior image quality, and MRI provides greater accuracy than CT in preoperative staging assessments. Nonetheless, the comparative study of MRI and CT in patients with gastroesophageal junction and upper gastric cancers remains to be elucidated.
