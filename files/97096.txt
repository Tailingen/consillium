Preoperative Neoadjuvant Immunotherapy Combined With Chemotherapy for Stage Ⅲ Unresectable Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
Explorative study, which evaluates the effect of Tislelizumab combined with chemotherapy in neoadjuvant treatment of stage Ⅲ unresectable non-small-cell lung carcinoma.
Non-small-cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
DRUG: Tislelizumab|DRUG: Pemetrexed (Non-squamous NSCLC) or Nab-paclitaxel(Squamous NSCLC)|DRUG: Carboplatin or Cisplatin|PROCEDURE: Surgery
R0 Resection Rate, R0 Resection Rate: The pathological results will showed that the incision margin was negative and no residual cancer cells were found under the microscope., 1 month after surgery
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective Response Rate (ORR): defined as the proportion of patients whose tumor size shrinks to predefined values，which including cases of CR and PR. Objective tumor response will be assessed using RECIST 1.1. Subjects must have measurable tumor lesions at baseline, and the response evaluation criteria are classified as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), and progressive disease (PD) according to RECIST 1.1., Pre-operation|Resectability Rate, Resectability Rate is defined as the percentage of patients who were able to undergo surgery after neoadjuvant therapy., Pre-operation|Major Pathological Response (MPR) Rate, Major Pathological Response (MPR) Rate: defined as ≤ 10% of residual tumor cells in the surgically resected tumor specimen and sampled regional lymph nodes after neoadjuvant treatment., 1 month after surgery|Rate of grade 3 and higher grade treatment-related adverse events, Adverse events will be evaluated and recorded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 5.0)., From date of treatment allocation until surgery or within 30 days after last dose of preoperative treatment|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Progression-Free Survival (PFS): defined as the time from the first dose until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first., Up to 12 months
Pathological Complete Response (pCR) Rate, Pathological Complete Response (pCR) Rate: no residual tumor cells in the surgically resected tumor specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes after neoadjuvant treatment., 1 month after surgery
This is a open-label, single-arm prospective clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Tislelizumab combined with chemotherapy in neoadjuvant treatment of newly diagnosed stage Ⅲ unresectable non-small cell lung cancer.
