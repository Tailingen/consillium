A Clinical Study of JS105 in Combination With Other Anti-tumor Therapies in Patients With Solid Tumors
This study is an open-label, multicenter, Phase Ib/II clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of JS105 in combination with other anti-tumor therapies in patients with advanced solid tumors. Patients will be enrolled in two stages: a dose-escalation stage and a dose-expansion stage.
