D-0316 in Patients With EGFR Positive Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
A Phase II, Open Label, Single-arm Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of D-0316 in Patients with Locally Advanced/Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer whose Disease has Progressed with Previous Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Therapy and whose Tumours are Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Mutation and T790M Mutation Positive
Solid Tumor|NSCLC|EGFR T790M
DRUG: D-0316
Objective response rate based on independent radiology review, ORR per RECIST 1.1 calculated as the proportion of patients with a best overall response defined as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)., 24 months
Progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by independent radiology review and investigator, PFS, defined as time from first dose of X-396 to progression or death due to any cause., 36 months|Overall survival (OS), OS, defined as time from first dose of X-396 to death due to any cause., 36 months|Duration of response(DoR), DoR, defined as time from first reponse to disease progression or death, 24 months|Disease control rate(DCR), DCR, defined as proportion of complete response, partial response, and disease stabilization to the proportion of patients with evaluable tumors., 24 months|Intracranial Progression-free survival(iPFS), iPFS, defined as the time between baseline brain metastases, from the date of study drug administration to the time between the onset of intracranial tumor progression or death., 36 months|Intracranial objective response rate(iORR), iORR, defined as the proportion of subjects with complete intracranial response, partial intracranial response to subjects with brain metastases at baseline., 24 months
This is a phase II, open label, single arm study assessing the safety and efficacy of D-0316 (Firstly, D-0316 was orally given 75mg for a cycle(21 days), if tolerated, the dose will be increased to 100mg. Otherwise, the dose will be maintained at 75mg.) in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor mutation positive and T790M mutation positive NSCLC,who have progressed following prior therapy with an approved Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) agent. The primary objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of D-0316 by assessment of Objective Response Rate according to RECIST 1.1 by an Independent Central Review.
