Safety and Efficacy of Carboplatin/Paclitaxel and Carboplatin/Paclitaxel/Bevacizumab With and Without Pictilisib in Previously Untreated Advanced or Recurrent Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of carboplatin/paclitaxel and carboplatin/paclitaxel/bevacizumab with and without pictilisib in particpants with previously untreated advanced or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Particpants will be randomized to receive 4 cycles of carboplatin (C)/paclitaxel (P) and either pictilisib or placebo, with (participants with non-squamous NSCLC) or without (participants with squamous NSCLC) bevacizumab (B). Anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression or intolerable toxicity occurs. Participants in placebo arms with disease progression may cross over to open-label active pictilisib.
