Study of Autologous Tumor-Draining Lymph Node-Derived Lymphocytes as Neoadjuvant Therapy for HER2-Negative Breast Cancer
RATIONALE: Patients with HER2-negative breast cancer not responding to initial neoadjuvant chemotherapy might have lower chances for a pathologic complete response (pCR) at definitive surgery, indicating worse prognosis. Adoptive cell therapy has demonstrated efficacy in advanced breast cancer, but whether the addition of adoptive cell therapy to neoadjuvant chemotherapy could increase the pCR rate remains unclear. Tumor-draining lymph node-derived lymphocytes (LNLs) that have abundant tumor-reactive T cells, but not exhausted T cells, are easy to produce. It is not yet known whether LNL treatment is safe and effective in patients with HER2-negative breast cancer not responding to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

PURPOSE: This open-label phase I/II trial is to investigate the safety and efficacy of autologous LNL in patients with HER2-negative breast cancer not responding to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

PROCEDURE: Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB)|DRUG: Doxorubicin|DRUG: Epirubicin|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Fludarabine|BIOLOGICAL: Tumor-draining lymph node-derived lymphocyte (LNL)|BIOLOGICAL: Interleukin-2|DRUG: Nab-paclitaxel
Phase I: Incidence of Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT), Adverse events are reported based upon Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 criteria. DLT will be defined as a non-hematologic Grade 3 or higher adverse event, occurring within the 28 days immediately after LNL infusion, that is probably or definitely related to LNL infusion, and lasts more than 28 days or does not resolve to Grade\<3 despite treatment with dexamethasone at 10 mg per 12 hours IV for 7 days (or other corticosteroid at equivalent dose), and/or tocilizumab at 8mg/kg IV for three times., From the LNL infusion up to 28 days post-infusion|Phase I: Incidence of Grade≥3 Treatment-Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE), Adverse events are reported based upon CTCAE version 5.0 criteria. The incidence of Grade≥3 TEAE occurring within the 28 days immediately after LNL infusion will be summarized with descriptive statistics., From the LNL infusion up to 28 days post-infusion|Phase II: Pathological complete response (pCR) rate using the definition of ypT0/Tis ypN0 at the time of definitive surgery, pCR rate (ypT0/Tis ypN0) is defined as the percentage of participants without residual invasive cancer on hematoxylin and eosin evaluation of the complete resected breast specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes following completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy assessed by the local pathologist at the time of definitive surgery., Up to approximately 18~29 weeks
Phase I: Pathological complete response (pCR) rate using the definition of ypT0/Tis ypN0 at the time of definitive surgery, pCR rate (ypT0/Tis ypN0) is defined as the percentage of participants without residual invasive cancer on hematoxylin and eosin evaluation of the complete resected breast specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes following completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy assessed by the local pathologist at the time of definitive surgery., Up to approximately 26~29 weeks|Phase I and phase II: Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective response rate is defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who have a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) during the study. The percentage of participants who experienced a CR or PR assessed by modified RECIST criteria by breast MRI is presented., Up to approximately 26~29 weeks|Phase I and phase II: 6-month, 1-year and 2-year Event-Free Survival (EFS), Event-free survival is defined as the time from enrollment (phase I) or randomization (phase II) to the first date of disease progression while on primary therapy or disease recurrence (local, regional, distant, invasive contralateral breast) after surgery or death due to any cause. Patients who terminate the study without evidence of any of the above events will be censored at the date of their last follow-up tumor assessment. Patients who start a new anti-tumor therapy (with the exception of adjuvant endocrine therapy in ER or PgR positive tumors after surgery) in the absence of disease progression or recurrence will be censored at their last follow-up tumor assessment before the start of the new therapy., Up to approximately two years|Phase I and phase II: Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the time from enrollment (phase I) or randomization (phase II) to death due to any cause. Participants without documented death at the time of the analysis were censored at the date of the last follow-up., Up to approximately five years|Phase I: Levels of multiple different cytokines in blood samples before and after LNL infusion., To evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of LNL, levels of multiple different cytokines in blood samples including Granzyme B, IFN-γ, GM-CSF, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, etc. will be measured using cytokine chips, ELISA or flow cytometry at various time points before and after LNL infusion., Up to approximately two years|Phase I: Distribution of T cell subsets in blood samples before and after LNL infusion., To evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of LNL, distribution of T cell subsets in blood samples will be measured using flow cytometry at various time points before and after LNL infusion., Up to approximately two years|Phase I: Distribution of T-cell receptor (TCR) clonotype in blood samples before and after LNL infusion., To evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of LNL, distribution of T-cell receptor (TCR) clonotype in blood samples will be measured using TCR sequencing at various time points before and after LNL infusion., Up to approximately two years|Phase II: Incidence of Grade≥3 Treatment-Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE), Adverse events are reported based upon CTCAE version 5.0 criteria. The incidence of Grade≥3 TEAE occurring within the 28 days immediately after LNL infusion will be summarized with descriptive statistics., From the LNL infusion up to 28 days post-infusion
