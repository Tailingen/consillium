Study of Neoadjuvant CT With Selective Radiotherapy in Patients With Intermediate-Risk Cancer Rectum
Phase II, Multicenter, Open-label, Non-randomized Study of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy (CAPECITABINE-OXALIPLATIN + BEVACIZUMAB) with Selective Radiotherapy and Chemotherapy with CAPECITABINE Use in Patients with Intermediate-Risk Cancer of the Rectum Defined by Magnetic Resonance Imaging.
Rectum Cancer
DRUG: Capecitabine|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Bevacizumab|RADIATION: Radiotherapy|DRUG: Capecitabine during all Radiotherapy period|PROCEDURE: Total Mesorectal Excision (TME)
Efficacy of XELOX/BVZ neoadjuvant therapy with selective radiotherapy use in patients with locally advanced tumors of the rectum, measured in terms of the proportion of responders (PCR + CCR), according to RECIST criteria, Until the end of study
Study treatment,which selectively omits neoadjuvant irradiation,can achieve a R0= 90%, At least 3 years for local recurrence and systemic recurrence|Rate of local and systemic recurrence, At least 3 years for local recurrence and systemic recurrence|Toxicity of treatment, At least 3 years for local recurrence and systemic recurrence|Rate of surgical complications during postoperative, At least 3 years for local recurrence and systemic recurrence|Profile of gene expression before neoadjuvant treatment, At least 3 years for local recurrence and systemic recurrence|Complete Phatologic Response (pCR), Complete pathologic response (pCR)estimated according to the number of subjects that showed yPT0N0 divided by the total number of subjects., 2012
XELOX / Bevacizumab will be administrated for 3 cycles over a 9 week period. XELOX without Bevacizumab will be administrated for an additional cycle over a 4 week period. Patients will undergo re-staging within 3 weeks of their 4th cycle of XELOX. This will include MRI of the pelvis. If the reassessment reveals that there has been no disease progression compared to the pre-treatment evaluation and the patient remains a candidate for an R0 resection, the patient will proceed to definitive rectal cancer surgery within 4 weeks from the last chemotherapy dose. If the surgical oncologist's reassessment reveals that the patient is not a candidate for an R0 resection, the patient will proceed to standard pre-operative radiation with synchronous Capecitabine.
