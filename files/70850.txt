Needle-based Percutaneous Ablation of Liver Tumors.
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if INT001 can ablate liver tumors in adults in an outpatient setting. It will also help us learn about the safety of INT001. The main questions it aims to answer are:

1. Using a needle under image guidance, the liver tumor is accessed and INT001 is injected. Upon injection into tumor, does INT001 ablate/kill the tumor entirely?
2. What medical problems do participants experience when receiving INT001?

Participants will:

Receive INT001 on day 1. Visit the clinic day 7, 30 and 90. Receive lab tests during each visit and MRI on day 30 and 90.
Liver Tumors|HCC - Hepatocellular Carcinoma|Metastatic Liver Tumor
DEVICE: Needle based delivery of INT001 into liver tumors under real-time image guidance
Ablation, Ablation of the tumor will be assessed using imaging criteria such as RECIST., MRI will be performed the day of the intervention, at 30 days and at 90 days.|Safety, Adverse events, if any, will be recorded, From day 1 to day 90
Biomarkers, Biomarkers such as AFP will be monitored, Day 30 and Day 90
