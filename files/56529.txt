Pregabalin in Treating Women With Hot Flashes
RATIONALE: Pregabalin may help relieve hot flashes in women with a history of breast cancer or those who have no history and do not wish to take estrogen therapy for fear of increased risk of breast cancer. It is not yet known what dose of pregabalin may be more effective in treating hot flashes.

PURPOSE: This is a randomized phase III trial to determine the efficacy of two doses of pregabalin, in comparison to placebo, in the prevention of hot flashes.

Numerical Change From Baseline in Hot Flash Score at Treatment Week 6 (Positive Numbers to Represent Increases and Negative Numbers to Represent Decreases)., Hot flash activity will be analyzed in a number of ways. For the primary analysis, the numerical change-from-baseline to hot flash score after week 6 of treatment will be compared between the highest dose treatment arm and the placebo arm. A hot flash score is computed for each patient by assigning points (1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe, 4=very severe) to each hot flash based on patient-reported severity, adding the points for each day, and averaging across each week of the study.

For the this analysis, the numerical change-from-baseline to hot flash score after week 6 of treatment will be compared between the lower dose treatment arm and the placebo arm.

Participants will complete this questionnaire weekly. This patient diary contains several questions related to potential side effects and side benefits of pregabalin measured on a numeric analogue scale (based on 0-10 scale with 10 being worst toxicity, providing numbers representing the worst median changes from baseline minus Maximum (Week 1-6) Symptom Experience Diary Distributions)., Baseline, 6 weeks during treatment.|Mood and Hot Flash-related Daily Interference on Activities After 6 Weeks of Treatment, Endpoints for this analysis will be median change from baseline to after week 6 of treatment. Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale is used to evaluate the specific impact of the study treatment on the effect hot flashes have on various life activities such as work, social, leisure and relationships. Responses to the questionnaire are recorded on a 0 to 10 scale. Lower scores are better., Baseline, after week 6 of treatment.
OBJECTIVES:

* To evaluate the efficacy of 150 mg of pregabalin versus placebo on hot flash scores in women with a history of breast cancer or women who do not wish to take estrogen therapy for fear of increased risk of breast cancer.
* To evaluate the side effect profile of different doses of pregabalin in these patients.
* To evaluate the effect of 150 mg of pregabalin versus placebo on the secondary outcome of interference of activities from hot flashes in these patients.
* To evaluate the efficacy and side effect profile of 75 mg of pregabalin versus placebo in these patients.

OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to age (18-49 years vs ≥ 50 years); selective estrogen-receptor modulator (i.e., tamoxifen or raloxifene) or aromatase inhibitor use (yes vs no); duration of hot flashes (\< 9 months vs ≥ 9 months); and frequency of hot flashes per 24-hour period (4-9 vs ≥ 10). Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

* Arm I: Patients receive 75 mg of oral pregabalin twice daily for 6 weeks.
* Arm II: Patients receive 150 mg of oral pregabalin twice daily for 6 weeks.
* Arm III: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily for 6 weeks. Treatment in all arms continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

Patients complete Hot Flash Diaries at baseline and once daily during treatment and the Symptom Experience Diary at baseline and once weekly during treatment. Patients also complete the Profile of Mood States and the Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale questionnaires at baseline and after completion of study treatment.
