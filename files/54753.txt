FLT-PET / MRI Brain Mets
Brain metastasis (BrM) develops in approximately 40% of cancer patients. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a form of radiotherapy that delivers high-dose per fraction to individual lesions that is commonly used to treat BrM.

Radionecrosis (RN) is an adverse event that occurs in approximately 10 - 25% of patients 6 - 24 months after treatment with SRS. Tumour progression may also occur due to local failure of treatment. Radionecrosis and tumour progression share very similar clinical features including vomiting, nausea, and focal neurologic findings.

Radionecrosis and tumour progression also share overlapping imaging characteristics. Due to their similarities, physicians need to perform a surgical resection to diagnose the complication. By using a hybrid FLT-PET/MRI scan, the investigators propose that this combination scan will provide robust data with which to differentiate between radionecrosis and tumour progression without the need for surgery. The investigators plan to conduct a single center feasibility study to investigate the potential in differentiating between SRS and tumour progression in patients, including those who may have previously undergone SRS for BrM, who are suspected to have either RN or tumour progression using hybrid FLT-PET/MRI imaging.
