Forceps Biopsy Versus Cryo-biopsy in the Diagnosis of Lung Cancer
This study was comprised of 30 patients who were scheduled for a diagnostic bronchoscopy due to a suspicion of lung cancer in order to obtain tissue samples for a final diagnosis , four biopsies were taken by each of cryobiopsy and forceps biopsy , to evaluate and compare the diagnostic yield of endobronchial cryobiopsy and forceps biopsy in the diagnosis of lung cancer .
Lung Cancer
PROCEDURE: bronchoscpe
Comparative study between Endobronchial Forceps-Biopsy and Cryo-Biopsy in the Diagnosis of bronchogenic carcinoma, The comparison between groups regarding qualitative data was done by using Chi-square test and/or Fisher exact test when the expected count in any cell found less than 5.at week 40, comprative , week 40
Diagnostic bronchoscopic interventions are used to evaluate and tissue sample from endobronchial lesions utilising variety of devices that can be delivered through the operative channel of a fibrio-optic bronchoscope.

All of the procedures were carried out with 2% lidocaine instillation and midazolam IV sedation All patients signed a written informed consent form for bronchoscopy and tissue sampling with forceps and a cryoprobe.between August 2020 and June 2021. All interventions were performed in the bronchoscopy unit of the Chest Medicine Department at Benha university Data were collected, revised, coded and entered to the Statistical Package for Social Science (IBM SPSS) version 23.
