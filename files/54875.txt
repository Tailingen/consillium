Accelerated Checkpoint Therapy for Any Steroid Dependent Patient With Brain Metastases
Immunotherapy treatments are intended to boost a person's immune system to fight their cancer. Treatment with immunotherapy has been shown to be effective in a wide range of cancers, including melanoma skin cancer, lung cancer and kidney cancer, among others.

Steroids are anti-inflammatory medications which may suppress the immune system. For this reason, persons requiring treatment with steroids have not previously been allowed to participate in immunotherapy clinical trials. Therefore, we do not know whether or not immunotherapy treatments are effective in patients who are also receiving treatment with steroids.

When cancer has spread to the brain swelling may occur around the tumors, and headache, nausea, seizures or stroke-like symptoms may occur. In this instance, steroids are important to reduce swelling within the brain, thus alleviating these symptoms.

Because patients requiring treatment with steroids have not previously been allowed to participate in immunotherapy clinical trials, we do not know whether treatment with immunotherapy is effective when steroid treatments are also used. This study will investigate this question, and also attempt to determine whether treatment with one steroid versus another results in a better response to immunotherapy.
Brain Metastases, Adult
DRUG: Glucocorticoid therapy
Intracranial and extracranial objective response rate, Objective response rate will be determined utilizing RECIST 1.1 criteria. Baseline staging diagnostic imaging (CT and/or MRI studies) will be performed in advance of beginning treatment and repeated 6 weeks following treatment initiation and at 12 week intervals thereafter., 24 weeks following enrolment of the last participant to study|Time to initiation of therapy, Defined as the time interval between first radiographic documentation of intracranial metastatic disease and initiation of systemic immunotherapy., 24 weeks following enrolment of the last participant to study
Mortality analyses, Secondary study outcomes include progression-free and overall survival (PFS, OS). PFS is defined as the time between the date of treatment initiation and the date of disease progression (determined utilizing RECIST 1.1 criteria) or death (whatever the cause), whichever occurs first. For participants who remain alive and whose disease has not progressed, PFS will be censored on the date of last visit/contact with disease assessments. PFS will be based on the disease assessment or date of death provided by the investigator. OS is defined as the time between the date of treatment initiation and the date of death (whatever the cause). For participants who remain alive OS will be censored on the date of last visit/contact with disease assessments. OS will be based on the date of death provided by the investigator., Upon completion of 12 month follow-up period for the final participant enrolled to the study.|Patient-reported quality of life analysis, An analysis of patient-reported quality of life will be conducted utilizing the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and the EORTC Brain Cancer Module (EORTC QLQ-BN20) questionnaires). Quality of life questionnaires will be administered to participants following enrolment to study but prior to initiation of immunotherapy. Follow-up questionnaires will be administered as part of the standard of care immunotherapy pre-treatment starting 6 weeks from Cycle 1 and every 6 weeks thereafter until end of treatment. Quality of life questionnaires should be administered prior to investigator assessment at each indicated time-point., Upon completion of 12 month follow-up period for the final participant enrolled to the study.|Assessment of treatment safety, The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, version 4.03) will be used to categorize treatment related and non-treatment related adverse events., Upon completion of 12 month follow-up period for the final participant enrolled to the study.
