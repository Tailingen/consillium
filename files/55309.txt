Methylation of cfDNA in Diagnosing and Monitoring Pulmonary Nodule
Patients found pulmonary nodules by CT screening by will be enrolled in this study prospectively. Plasma cfDNA sequencing of these patients will be used to diagnose and monitor benign and malignant pulmonary nodules.
Pulmonary Nodule, Solitary
PROCEDURE: plasma cfDNA methylation
The efficacy of cfDNA methylation in the diagnosis of benign and malignant pulmonary nodules, The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy are calculated according to standard definitions to evaluate the efficacy of cfDNA methylation in the diagnosis of benign and malignant pulmonary nodules ., 12 months
This study prospectively included patients with pulmonary nodules (0.5-3 cm) diagnosed by CT. Methylation of plasma cfDNA in these patients will be performed. Evaluation of benign and malignant diagnostic efficacy of cfDNA methylation in pulmonary nodules with definite pathological findings. Pulmonary nodules that temporarily not require invasive examination will be performed CT follow-up and dynamically monitored methylation changes of cfDNA. And the methylation changes were to establish a model for the diagnosis and monitor of benign and malignant pulmonary nodules.
