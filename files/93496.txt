Increasing Pre-Surgical Identification of Muscle Invasive Tumor Evaluations Prior to Planned Cystectomy (INSITE)
This trial aims at investigating the diagnostic ability of a combined diagnostic panel including systematic endoscopic evaluation (SEE), blood-based ctDNA assay, and urine-based cfDNA assay to predict the presence of residual tumor remaining in the bladder at cystectomy.

Patients who are planned for cystectomy due to bladder cancer will be considered for enrollment based on inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Utility of a proprietary urine and blood biomarker test for muscle-invasive bladder cancer presence, Determine the utility of a novel, proprietary combined blood and urinary genomic biomarker (ctDNA and cfDNA) assay in predicting the presence or absence of a muscle-invasive bladder cancer at cystectomy when no disease is identified on systematic endoscopic evaluation (SEE, aka seeT0)., 2 years|Utility of a DNA test for muscle-invasive bladder cancer presence, Negative predictive value (NPV) of a negative ctDNA and urine-based cfDNA assay to determine the presence or absence of muscle-invasive bladder cancer (pTmi0) on final cystectomy pathology in patients undergoing radical cystectomy with a pre-surgical seeT0 bladder., 2 years
Accuracy of surgical specimen DNA test to predict muscle-invasive disease, Determine the accuracy of a negative blood-based ctDNA assay combined with a urinary genomic cfDNA assay to predict the presence or absence of muscle-invasive disease in cystectomy surgical specimen., 2 years|Statistical accuracy evaluation of blood-based ctDNA assay for muscle-invasive bladder cancer presence, Negative predictive value (NPV) of blood-based ctDNA assay to determine the presence or absence of muscle-invasive bladder cancer (pTmi0) on final cystectomy pathology in patients undergoing radical cystectomy., 2 years
The principle outcome of this study is to determine the negative predictive value (NPV) of finding no muscle invasive (pT2) tumor in seeT0 patients with a negative result on the ctDNA assay prior to radical cystectomy.

Eligible candidates for radical cystectomy and INSITE trial:

* Patients with high grade T1 urothelial carcinoma who elect for "early" /upfront cystectomy
* Patients with non-muscle invasive high grade Ta urothelial carcinoma or carcinoma in situ who have relapsed or are refractory / unresponsive to intravesical therapy and have elected to undergo cystectomy
* cT2-T3 muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma (irrespective of receipt of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy) Prior to cystectomy, tissue (transurethral resection of bladder tumor), urine and blood samples will be obtained at baseline for urine biopsy, ctDNA testing and future correlative studies.

After anesthetic induction for radical cystectomy, the patient will undergo rigid cystoscopy with targeted transurethral resection (TUR) of visible tumor or tumor bed, and two additional random bladder biopsies of normal-appearing bladder mucosa. Urine and blood samples will be obtained day of procedure for utilization for urine biopsy, ctDNA, and future correlative studies.

Following cystectomy, a diagnostic testing panel of pre-cystectomy cystoscopic and biopsy findings, ctDNA, and urine biopsy will be compared to final pathologic specimen.

Blood samples will be obtained 4-6 weeks (±2 weeks) post-procedure and 6 months (±1 month) post-procedure for analysis and ctDNA for post-procedure surveillance and other additional correlative studies. Additional blood sample collections at 12 months and 24 months post-procedure are optional.
