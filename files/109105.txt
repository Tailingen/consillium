Study of Blood Samples From Patients With Ewing Sarcoma and Their Relatives
RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood in the laboratory from patients with cancer and their relatives may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

PURPOSE: This research study is looking at blood samples collected from patients with Ewing sarcoma and their relatives.
Sarcoma
OTHER: genome-wide association study
Identification and characterization of susceptibility genes in patients with Ewing sarcoma, Identification and characterization of susceptibility genes in patients with Ewing sarcoma, Through study completion, an average of 10 years
OBJECTIVES:

* To identify and characterize a genetic susceptibility factor to Ewing's sarcoma by performing a Genome-Wide Association Study with as many as possible Ewing sarcoma patients.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Blood samples are collected from patients and their relatives. Blood DNA samples are analyzed for susceptibility genes of Ewing Sarcoma.
