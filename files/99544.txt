An Open-Label Study of a Novel JAK-inhibitor, INCB052793, Given to Patients With Advanced Malignancies
This was a study of INCB052793 given to patients with advanced malignancies that was to be conducted in three phases; Phase 1a (Monotherapy) and Phase 1b (Combination Therapy) and Phase 2 (Combination therapy of INCB052793 with azacitidine and itacitinib with azacitidine).

Phase 1a and 1b: Number of Participants With at Least One Treatment-Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE) and Serious Adverse Event (SAE), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a medicinal investigational drug. The untoward medical occurrence does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with treatment. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that results in death; is life-threatening; requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of present hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is a medically important event that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization. A TEAE was defined as any AE either reported for the first time or worsening of a pre-existing event after first dose of study drug and within 30 days of the last dose of study drug., From first dose of study drug up to 30 days after last dose of study drug (Up to approximately 3.4 years)|Phase 2: Objective Response Rate (ORR) in Hematological Malignancies, ORR is defined as the proportion of participants who achieved complete response (CR), CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi), partial response (PR), or hematologic improvement (HI), using the IWG response criteria., Baseline through end of study (Up to approximately 4.5 years)
Phase 1A and 1B: Percentage of Participants With Response as Determined by Investigator's Assessment, Response rate is defined as the percentage of participants who achieved best overall response (BOR) as determined by IWG response criteria of investigator's assessment. A participant was considered an objective responder based on the following- Solid tumors: participant had a best overall response (BOR) of CR or PR, Lymphoma: participant had a BOR of complete radiologic response/complete metabolic response or partial remission/partial metabolic response, AML: participant had a BOR of CR, CRi, morphological leukemia-free state (MLFS), or PR, MDS: participant had a BOR of CR, PR, or marrow CR, MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN): participant had a BOR of CR, PR, or marrow response, MM: participant had a BOR of stringent CR, CR, very good PR, PR, or MR. Subjects are combined by tumor type for this analysis., Baseline through end of study (Up to approximately 4.5 years)|Phase 2: Number of Participants With at Least One TEAE and SAE, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a medicinal investigational drug.

An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that results in death; is life-threatening; requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of present hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is a medically important event that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization. A TEAE was defined as any AE either reported for the first time or worsening of a pre-existing event after first dose of study drug and within 30 days of the last dose of study drug., From first dose of study drug up to 30 days after last dose of study drug (Up to approximately 1.3 years)|Phase 1a, 1b, and Phase 2: Cmax: Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration for INCB052793, Cmax is defined as the maximum observed plasma concentration measured at steady state (Day 15).
