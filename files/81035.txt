Rectal Tumor Resection Using the UNI-VEC Multichannel Transanal Access Device
The aim of the clinical trial is to investigate whether the use of a new multichannel endoscopic transanal access device (named UNI-VEC) is safe and effective in the resection of a rectal polyp or tumor that sits in the distal part of the colon (up to about 20 cm from the anal margin). This is the first study to test the device in humans, after proving its good performance in preclinical development (preclinical development has included functional laboratory tests and an animal trial).

DEVICE: Treatment of rectal lesions with UNI-VEC
Assess that the use of the device meet the established functional requiremnt of allowing the removal of polyps, The device must allow the removal of polyps with a minimum size of 2 cm (maximum diameter of the removed polyp measured in mm) in the rectum., During the procedure
Rate of anorectal hemorrhagic events, Anorectal hemorrhagic events for each patinet will be recorded in a table and the number of events will be counted., During the intervention and 1 week after the intervention.|Rate of injuries to the anorectal canal and perianal region, The number of injuries to the anorectal canal and perianal region will be recoreded in a table and then the total number of injuries will be counted., During the intervention and 1 week after the intervention.|Assessment of anorectal continence, Anorectal continence will be assesed for each Participant with the Wexner Score, At 7 and 30 days after the procedure. If anorectal incontinence persists at 30 days: follow-up at 2 months. If anorectal incontinence persists: follow-up at 6 months.
