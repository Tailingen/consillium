A Study of XB628 in Participants With Recurrent Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is a phase 1, first-in-human, open-label, dose-escalation study of XB628, a first-in-class bispecific antibody natural killer (NK) cell engager that targets NK group 2 member A (NKG2A), an inhibitory receptor on NK cells, and programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1).

This study consists of a Dose-Escalation Stage. The Dose-Escalation Stage is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended dosage(s) for expansion (RDE\[s\]) of XB628 as a single agent.
