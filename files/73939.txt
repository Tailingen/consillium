The success of PD-1 antibody immunotherapy has brought about tremendous changes in clinical practice for treating patients with ESCC. Many patients with ESCC were not resectable at first presentation because of locally advanced disease in the primary site and/or in lymph nodes. The primary intention of our study was to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of combining tislelizumab and chemoradiation for conversion therapy for these patients. The enrolled patients in this study should be with pathologically proved ESCC staged IIIb-IVa according to the 8th edition of UICC/AJCC TNM stage classification. This is a single institution and single-arm phase I/II study, the estimated enrollment was 30 participants.
