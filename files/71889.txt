A Clinical Trial of TQB3909 Tablets in Patients With Breast Cancer
TQB3909 is an inhibitor targeting B-cell lymphoma (BCL)-2 protein. By binding to BCL-2 protein, TQB3909 releases Pro apoptotic proteins such as BCL-2-Anatagonist/Killer 1(BAK), BCL-2 associated X (BAX) protein and BCL-2 associated death (BAD) protein, promotes the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, phosphatidylserine eversion, stimulates caspase 3/7 activity and caspase 3/9 cleavage, and induces apoptosis.
Advanced Breast Cancer
DRUG: TQB3909 tablets
Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), DLT will be defined as toxicities that meet pre-defined severity criteria(according to the NCI CTCAE v5.0 toxicity assessment criteria), and assessed as having a suspected relationship to study drug that occurred from the first dose to the end of the first treatment cycle., At the end of Cycle 1 (Cycle 1, Day 28)|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), MTD was defined as the highest dose at which dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) occurred in less than 33% of patients., At the end of Cycle 1 (Cycle 1, Day 28)|Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D), DLT describes side effects of a drug or other treatment that are serious enough to evaluate RP2D of TQB3909 tablets in adult patients with Breast cancers, Baseline up to 24 months
