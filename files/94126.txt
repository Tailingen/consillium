The Effect of Mobile Application-based Information About Before and After Surgery
Aim and hypothesis: This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of mobile information given to women before and after breast cancer surgery on anxiety, distress, and quality of life. E-mobile information given to women before and after breast cancer surgery reduces the level of anxiety (I) and the level of distress (II), and positively affects their quality of life (III).

Methods: This randomized controlled study was conducted between April and August 2021 in the surgical oncology clinic-outpatient clinics of a university hospital. Patients in the intervention group (n=42) used the mobile information application for one month with routine care. Patients in the control group (n=40) received their routine care. Data were collected with data collection forms one week before and three weeks after surgery.

Change of NCCN Distress Thermometer score at baseline and one month later, This scale was developed by Roth et al. (1998) to measure psycho-social distress in cancer patients. It consists of the visual analog scale that individuals can apply on their own, consists of only one question, and is used to evaluate the stress situations patients have experienced in the last week and a list of problems. There is a thermometer with numbers from 0 to 10 on the scale. On the distress thermometer, a score of 0 indicates that the individual has never experienced distress, and a score of 10 indicates that he or she has experienced distress at the upper limit., The first measurement was collected one week before surgery. The second measurement was collected 3 weeks after surgery.
Change of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale score at baseline and one month later, The HAD is a self-report scale used to diagnose anxiety and depression in a short time and to determine the risk group in patients with physical illness and/or applying to primary health care services. Only the Anxiety subscale (HAD-A) was used in this study. Anxiety subscale consists of 7 items (1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th and 13th questions). Items 1, 3, 5, 11, and 13 show gradually decreasing severity. The score that can be obtained from the HAD-A ranges between 0 and 21 (min.-max.)., The first measurement was collected one week before surgery. The second measurement was collected 3 weeks after surgery.|Change of FACT-G Quality of Life Scale score at baseline and one month later, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (version 4) Quality of Life Scale consists of 4 dimensions; physical well-being (7 items), social/family well-being (7 items), emotional well-being (6 items), and functional well-being (7 items). There are a total of 27 questions on the scale. The scale has a 5-point Likert-type structure and is scored between 0-4. All questions are used to assess the patients' quality of life in the last 7 days. The total score of the scale is equal to the sum of the sub-dimensions, and a high score on the scale indicates a high quality of life., The first measurement was collected one week before surgery. The second measurement was collected 3 weeks after surgery.
