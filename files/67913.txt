CALIPSO: Calfactant for Acute Lung Injury in Pediatric Stem Cell Transplant and Oncology Patients
Acute lung injury (ALI) is a common, life-threatening complication among pediatric leukemia and lymphoma and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients. Although these children represent a relatively small and unique patient population, they account for the largest proportion of deaths of all pediatric diseases. The long-term goal of this project is to improve outcomes among these patients. Recently, the intratracheal administration of calfactant has resulted in decreased mortality among children with ALI including promising results among children with cancer and following HSCT. Consequently, the primary specific aim of this study is to assess the effect of calfactant on intensive care (PICU) survival among pediatric leukemia and lymphoma and HSCT patients with ALI. Secondary aims include assessment of the effect of calfactant on oxygenation and on the length of mechanical ventilation, PICU stay, and hospital stay. Calfactant therapy has been found to be of benefit in acute lung injury in the overall pediatric population by improving oxygenation and decreasing mortality. These findings, in conjunction with recent subgroup analysis in which calfactant therapy appeared to improve outcomes in immunocompromised children provide the rationale for assessing calfactant therapy in this patient population.

Acute Lung Injury
DRUG: Calfactant|OTHER: Air placebo
All-cause Mortality at the Time of Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) Discharge, Overall mortality rate from admission to PICU discharge, Admission to PICU discharge, up to 120 days
Ventilator Free Days (VFDs), Number of days the patient is alive and off of the ventilator, 60 days after study enrollment|Total Duration of Stay Required, Length of stay (LOS) ,measured in days, from admission to PICU discharge and admission to hospital discharge., Admission to discharge, up to 120 days|Change in Oxygenation: First Intervention, The Oxygenation Index after the first intervention is calculated as the fraction of inspired oxygen, in percent, times the mean airway pressure, in mmHg, divided by the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood, in mmHg. Lower values are better., 48 hours after enrollment, up to 12 hours after each intervention|Change in Oxygenation: Second Intervention, The Oxygenation Index after the second intervention (if applicable) is calculated as the fraction of inspired oxygen, in percent, times the mean airway pressure, in mmHg, divided by the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood, in mmHg. Lower values are better., 48 hours after enrollment, up to 12 hours after each intervention
