A Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy Study of ACE-011 in Patients With Osteolytic Lesions of Multiple Myeloma
Multi-center, randomized, multiple-dose study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of ACE-011 in patients with osteolytic lesions of multiple myeloma.
Multiple Myeloma
BIOLOGICAL: ACE-011|BIOLOGICAL: Placebo
Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), A treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product, regardless of causality assessment. A TEAE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal (investigational) product. Any worsening (i.e., any clinical significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition, which was temporally associated with the use of the sponsor's medicinal (investigational) product, was also a TEAE. The number of participants with at least one TEAE are reported., From first dose to termination visit on Day 169|Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) Related to Study Drug, A treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) related to study drug was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product, that was determined to be related to the study drug. A TEAE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product. Any worsening (i.e., any clinical significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition, which was temporally associated with the use of the sponsor's medicinal (investigational) product, was also a TEAE. The number of participants with at least one TEAE are reported. Treatment emergent adverse events were assessed by the investigator as possibly, probably, or definitely related to the study drug., From first dose to termination visit on Day 169|Number of Participants With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose (including overdose) that was fatal, was life threatening, required or prolonged inpatient hospitalization, resulted in permanent or significant disability/incapacity, or was a congenital anomaly/birth defect. The number of participants with at least one serious adverse event are reported., From first dose up to termination visit on Day 169|Change From Baseline in Hemoglobin, Summary of the change from baseline in hemoglobin (g/dL) by the pre-specified timepoints. Baseline was defined as the last measurement prior to dosing. Data were summarized for all treated participants who had at least 1 postdosing measurement., Day 1 (baseline), Day 8, Day 29, Day 36, Day 57, Day 85, Day 113, Day 169|Number of Participants With Electrocardiogram Abnormalities, The number of participants with at least one clinically significant postbaseline electrocardiogram abnormality. The abnormalities included left ventricular hypertrophy, atrial fibrillation, sinus bradycardia, sinus tachycardia, and myocardial ischemia. Data is reported as the cumulative number of participants with abnormalities over the scheduled collection timepoints., Pre-dose, Day 1, Day 92, and Day 169|Number of Participants With Hypertension or Increased Blood Pressure, The number of participants who experienced hypertension or an increase in blood pressure from baseline up to Day 92. Abnormal blood pressure was defined as:

* Systolic blood pressure ≤ 90 or ≥ 180 mmHg
* Systolic blood pressure change (increase or decrease) ≥ 20 mmHg
* Diastolic blood pressure ≤ 60 or ≥ 100 mmHg
* Diastolic blood pressure change (increase or decrease) ≥ 15 mmHg, From baseline up to Day 92
Number of Participants With Skeletal-related Events (SRE), Skeletal-related events are defined as pathologic fracture, radiation therapy to bone, surgery to bone, or spinal cord compression, within 2 weeks of study enrollment. They are determined by skeletal surveys, including x-rays of the skull, entire spine, pelvis, ribs, humeri, and femora., From first dose up to 2 weeks post first dose|Percent Change From Baseline in Bone Pain Visual Analog Scale (VAS), The visual analog scale (VAS) is a pain rating scale. Scores are based on the percent change from baseline (Day 1) in self-reported measures of symptoms that are recorded with a single handwritten mark placed at one point along the length of a 10-cm line that represents a continuum between the two ends of the scale-"no pain" on the left end (0 cm) of the scale and the "worst pain" on the right end of the scale (10 cm). Measurements from the starting point (left end) of the scale to the patients' marks are recorded in centimeters and are interpreted as their pain. The values can be used to track pain progression for a patient or to compare pain between patients with similar conditions. In addition to pain, the scale has also been used to evaluate mood, appetite, asthma, dyspepsia, and ambulation., From baseline (Day 1) to Day 29, Day 57, Day 85, Day 113, Day 141, Day 169
