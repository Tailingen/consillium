Effect of Honey For CIN II
The following hypothesis is tested: Medical grade honey in CIN II causes a higher clearance of the hr-HPV virus and an increase in the normalization of CIN II lesions compared to expectant management.
Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia-II|High Risk Human Papillomavirus
DRUG: Medical grade honey formulation (MGH) (L-MesitranÂ®)
Clearance of hr-HPV, The following hypothesis is tested: Medical grade honey in CIN II causes a higher clearance of the hr-HPV virus, 6 months
Regression of CIN II, Defined as a regression to Pap1, 12-24 months|Clearance of hr-HPV and normalization of cytology (KOPAC), Normalization of cytology (KOPAC) (depending on NVOG/RIVM flowchart)., 12-24 mnths|Characteristics of the vaginal microbiome, Species specific and diversity analysis, changes due to honey and relationship with the other outcomes measures, 0-6 months
In this pilot study, we will include 60 patients with newly diagnosed CIN II. Patients will be counseled according to standard guidelines between a LLETZ, imiquimod or expectant management. Patients choosing for expectant management will be asked to participate in the study and will be treated with medical grade honey. Patients choosing for expectant management but not participating in the study and thus not using medicinal honey will be asked for the control arm. Follow-up assessment takes place in accordance with the national guideline (first check-up is after 6 months). In addition, swabs for vaginal microbiota analysis will be taken at 0 and 6 months. Immunohistochemical stainings for the local immune infiltrate will be performed on biopsies taken during regular colposcopy at t=0. This exploratory study aims to investigate if there is a potential effect of honey and provides insight into its mechanisms of action.
