Chronomodulated Chemotherapy Followed by Concurrent Chemo-radiotherapy With IMRT in the Treatment of Advanced Nasopharyngeal Cancer
1. Observe and compare the chrono-chemotherapy IMRT and conventional chemotherapy and intensity modulated radiotherapy term efficacy of the treatment of locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
2. Evaluation chrono-chemotherapy IMRT and conventional chemotherapy and intensity modulated radiotherapy in locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma safety and tolerability.

3）observing the adverse reaction and effects of two groups,expected chrono-chemotherapy group can achieve lower toxicity, improve the curative effect, for the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma provides a more reasonable way.

DEVICE: Chrono-chemotherapy pump:Melodie|DEVICE: Routine intravenous drip|DRUG: induction Chrono-chemotherapy|DRUG: induction Routine-chemotherapy|DRUG: cisplatin chrono-chemotherapy|DRUG: cisplatin routine-chemotherapy|RADIATION: intensity-modulated radiation therapy
Number of Participants with curative effect, Evaluate the immediate effect at 1year after Concurrent chemo-radiotherapy by RECIST., 1 year|Number of Participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety, To assess and record nausea, vomiting, oral mucositis, diarrhea and other adverse drug reactions by CTC 3.0., 5 years
Progression-free survival, Evaluate the Progression-free survival at five years after Concurrent chemo-radiotherapy by RECIST., 5 years|Overall survival, Evaluate the Overall survival at five years after Concurrent chemo-radiotherapy by RECIST., 5 years
