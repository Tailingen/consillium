AMG 102 Plus ECX for Unresectable Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric or Esophagogastric Junction Cancer
Study Phase: 1b/2 Indication: Previously untreated subjects with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic gastric or esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma.

Primary Objective(s):

Part 1: To identify safe dose levels of AMG 102, up to 15 mg/kg Q3W, to combine with ECX.

Part 2 (phase 2-double-blind): To estimate with pre-specified precision the effect of the addition of AMG 102 to ECX on progression free survival (PFS).
