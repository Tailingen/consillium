CART-19 FOR Relapsed/Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia （ALL）
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficiency of CD19-Targeted CAR-T in Treating Patients with relapsed/refractory acute leukemia.
Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Acute
BIOLOGICAL: CART-19 cells
Dose-limiting toxicity, 28 days|Incidence of adverse events as assessed, 3 months|Disease response (CR or CRi), 3 months
Engraftment of transferred CD19+ CAR T cells, 28 days|CAR19-specific antibody level, 6 months|Duration of response, 1year|Progression Free Survival, 1year|Survival, 1year
The relapsed/refractory ALL patients will receive FC (F,Fludarabine，C，Cyclophosphamide) chemotherapy followed by infusion of allogenic or autologous CD19-Targeted CAR-T cells.No graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prevention will be conducted before or after infusion. Dose-limiting toxicity,incidence of adverse events and disease response will be detected post-infusion.
