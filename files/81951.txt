The Effect of Beta-glucan in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine how beta-glucan affects the immune system in subjects with non-small cell lung cancer.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: beta-glucan
blood specimens will be obtained to examine the ability of beta-glucan to prime neutrophils complement receptor 3 (CR3) and test the cytotoxicity of the primed neutrophils., compare CR3 CBRM1/5 expression, CR3-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) frequency, and T-cell function (cytokine secretion) before and after beta-glucan uptake, pre-treatment and post-treatment|resected lung tissue will be tested to determine macrophage phenotype, AIM 3 only, post-treatment
Beta-glucan (Imucell WGP) is an over-the-counter dietary supplement that enhances the body's immune system. Imucell WGP is extracted from food-grade baker's yeast, which is permitted for use in food by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Studies in animals have shown that Imucell WGP helps trigger white blood cells to destroy cancer cells. Other animal studies combining Imucell WGP with anti-cancer medications have shown greater tumor regression and tumor-free survival.
