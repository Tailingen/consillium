Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors Intrathecal Injection in Patients With Leptomeningeal Metastases in NSCLC
This is a prospective, single-arm, open clinical study, which was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an immune checkpoint inhibitor combined with pemetrexed intrathecal injection in the treatment of patients with NSCLC associated with leptomeningeal metastases.
NSCLC Associated With Leptomeningeal Metastases
DRUG: Tislelizumab, pemetrexed
Objective response rate (LM ORR) for leptomeningeal metastases., Defined as the response to treatment as assessed by the investigator based on the modified Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Leptomeningeal Metastases (RANO-LM) criteria, containing cases of complete response, partial response, and major response., 12 months.
Median Progression-Free Survival (CNS-PFS) in the Central Nervous System., Progression-free survival will be measured as time to radiologic, cytologic, or LM-related clinical progression., Time from the start of intrathecal therapy to radiologic, cytologic, or LM-related clinical progression, whichever outcome occurs first, assessed up to 12 months.|Progression-Free Survival (PFS)., Progression-free survival will be measured as time to either progression or death., Time from the first day of administration of study drug until the first efficacy assessment of disease progression (PD) or death from any cause, assessed up to 12 months.|Overall survival (OS)., Overall survival will be measured as time to death from any cause., Time from the date of randomisation to the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 12 months.|Disease Control Rate (DCR)., The DCR was defined as the proportion of patients with the best efficacy (complete response or partial response or stable disease)., 12 months.|Adverse events., toxicity values caused by intrathecal injection treatment., 12 months.
