A Pilot Study Utilizing Proteomic and Genomic Profiling for Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer
This study will use proteomic and genomic profiling to analyze tumor tissue to see if treatment selected by this analysis will benefit patients.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
OTHER: treated recommended
Determine the impact of targeted therapy for breast cancer based upon proteomic and genomic profiling using RPMA, IHC analysis, RNA-Seq, and Exome sequencing on PFS and GMI., Determine the impact of targeted therapy for breast cancer based upon proteomic and genomic profiling using RPMA, IHC analysis, RNA-Seq, and Exome sequencing on PFS and GMI., 24 months
Record the frequency with which proteomic, IHC, and genomic profiling analysis of a patient's tumor by RPMA, IHC analysis, RNA-Seq, and Exome sequencing yields a target against which there is an FDA-approved agent or therapeutic regimen., Record the frequency with which proteomic, IHC, and genomic profiling analysis of a patient's tumor by RPMA, IHC analysis, RNA-Seq, and Exome sequencing yields a target against which there is an FDA-approved agent or therapeutic regimen., 24 months
Perform RPMA based batch analysis of all samples at the conclusion of this study, to measure 100-150 protein signaling targets. Protein activation will be correlated with clinical response., The data from this exploratory analysis will help generate the hypothesis for a future prospective study., 24 months
