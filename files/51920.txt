Inducible Regulatory T Cells (iTregs) in Non-Myeloablative Sibling Donor Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation
This is a phase I single center dose escalation study with an extension at the best available dose to determine the tolerability of inducible regulatory T cells (iTregs) when given to adult patients undergoing non-myeloablative HLA-identical sibling donor peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation for the treatment of a high risk malignancy. Up to 5 dose cohorts will be tested. Once the tolerable dose is determined for iTregs, enrollment will continue with an additional 10 patients using sirolimus/Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis to gain further safety information and to provide pilot data in this treatment setting.

BIOLOGICAL: iTreg
Incidence of grade 3-5 infusional toxicity, Targeted adverse events and unexpected events not explained by the PBSCT or disease will be collected \[(1-4 hours after the iTreg infusion and before the PBSCT at day 0) and 24 hours and 48 hours after the iTreg infusion (+/- 2 hours)\], Within 48 Hours After iTregs Administration
Cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a complication that can occur after a stem cell or bone marrow transplant in which the newly transplanted material attacks the transplant recipient's body.

Co-enrollment in University Of Minnesota protocol MT2001-10 is required and transplantation will be according to that protocol with iTregs administered the morning of day 0 followed no sooner than 4 hours later by the PBSC transplantation.
