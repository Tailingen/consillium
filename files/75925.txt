Study of Pexidartinib in Asian Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a Phase I, non-randomized, open-label, multiple dose study of pexidartinib in Asian subjects with advanced solid tumors. The study will be conducted in a dose escalation to assess the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary antitumor activity of pexidartinib.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: Pexidartinib
Overall Response Based on RECIST V1.1 Following Oral Doses of Pexidartinib (Efficacy Analysis Set), For the assessment of tumor response, participants were classified into the best of the following tumor response categories by RECIST v1.1: complete response (CR), disappearance of all target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level; partial response (PR), at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters; stable disease (SD); neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study; progressive disease (PD), at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study and the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm; or not evaluable (NE) for analysis. Objective response rate was defined as CR or PR and disease control rate was defined as CR, PR, or SD., Day 1 through Day 28 after last dose (within 18 months)
Duration of Response or Duration of Stable Disease Following Oral Doses of Pexidartinib (Efficacy Analysis Set), Based on RECIST v1.1, complete response (CR), disappearance of all target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level; partial response (PR), at least a 30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, with reference to baseline sum diameters; stable disease (SD); neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD), with reference to smallest sum diameters; PD, at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, with reference to smallest sum on study and sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm; Duration of response for responders (CR or PR) is defined as the time interval between the date of the earliest qualifying response and the date of PD or death for any cause, whichever occurs earlier. Duration of SD is defined as the time interval, in the absence of either CR or PR that will be calculated between the date of the first administration of the study drug and the date of PD., Day 1 through Day 28 after last dose (within 18 months)|A Summary of Pexidartinib Pharmacokinetic Parameter (Cmax) by Cohort and Day Following Oral Doses of Pexidartinib, Maximum concentration (Cmax) of pexidartinib was assessed using standard non-compartmental methods., Cycle 1, Day 1 and Day 15 at predose, 0.5h, 1h, 2h, 4h, and 8h postdose (each cycle was 28 days)|A Summary of Pexidartinib Pharmacokinetic Parameter (AUC[0-8h]) by Cohort and Day Following Oral Doses of Pexidartinib, Area under the curve from 0 to 8 hours (AUC\[0-8h\]) was assessed using standard non-compartmental methods., Cycle 1, Day 1 and Day 15 at predose, 0.5h, 1h, 2h, 4h, and 8h postdose (each cycle was 28 days)|A Summary of Pexidartinib Pharmacokinetic Parameter (Tmax) by Cohort and Day Following Oral Doses of Pexidartinib, Time at maximum pexidartinib concentration (Tmax) was assessed using standard non-compartmental methods., Cycle 1, Day 1 and Day 15 at predose, 0.5h, 1h, 2h, 4h, and 8h postdose (each cycle was 28 days)|A Summary of Pexidartinib Pharmacokinetic Parameter (R[AUC]) by Cohort Following Oral Doses of Pexidartinib, Accumulation ratio of area under the curve (R\[AUC\]) was assessed using standard non-compartmental methods., Cycle 1, Day 15 at predose, 0.5h, 1h, 2h, 4h, and 8h postdose (each cycle was 28 days)|A Summary of Pexidartinib Pharmacokinetic Parameter (R[Cmax]) by Cohort Following Oral Doses of Pexidartinib, Accumulation ratio of maximum concentration of pexidartinib (R\[Cmax\]) was assessed using standard non-compartmental methods., Cycle 1, Day 15 at predose, 0.5h, 1h, 2h, 4h, and 8h postdose (each cycle was 28 days)|A Summary of Plasma ZAAD-1006a Pharmacokinetic Parameter (AUC[0-8h]) Following Oral Doses of Pexidartinib, Area under the curve from 0 to 8 hours (AUC\[0-8h\]) was assessed using standard non-compartmental methods., Cycle 1, Day 1 and Day 15 at predose, 0.5h, 1h, 2h, 4h, and 8h postdose (each cycle was 28 days)|A Summary of Plasma ZAAD-1006a Pharmacokinetic Parameter (Cmax) Following Oral Doses of Pexidartinib, Maximum concentration (Cmax) of pexidartinib was assessed using standard non-compartmental methods., Cycle 1, Day 1 and Day 15 at predose, 0.5h, 1h, 2h, 4h, and 8h postdose (each cycle was 28 days)|A Summary of Plasma ZAAD-1006a Pharmacokinetic Parameter (Tmax) Following Oral Doses of Pexidartinib, Time at maximum pexidartinib concentration (Tmax) was assessed using standard non-compartmental methods., Cycle 1, Day 1 and Day 15 at predose, 0.5h, 1h, 2h, 4h, and 8h postdose (each cycle was 28 days)|A Summary of Plasma ZAAD-1006a Pharmacokinetic Parameter (MR AUC[0-8h]) Following Oral Doses of Pexidartinib, Metabolite to parent drug ratio of area under the curve from 0-8 h (MR AUC\[0-8h\]) was assessed using standard non-compartmental methods., Cycle 1, Day 1 and Day 15 at predose, 0.5h, 1h, 2h, 4h, and 8h postdose (each cycle was 28 days)|A Summary of Plasma ZAAD-1006a Pharmacokinetic Parameter (MR Cmax) Following Oral Doses of Pexidartinib, Metabolite to parent drug ratio of maximum pexidartinib concentration (MR Cmax) was assessed using standard non-compartmental methods., Cycle 1, Day 1 and Day 15 at predose, 0.5h, 1h, 2h, 4h, and 8h postdose (each cycle was 28 days)|Number and Percentage of Participants With Common Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) (â‰¥20%) Classified by Preferred Term (Safety Analysis Set), An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.
