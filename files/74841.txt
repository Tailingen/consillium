[18F]Fluoroestradiol-PET/CT Companion Imaging Study to the FORESEE Trial
This protocol is a companion imaging study that will add FES-PET/CT imaging to the FORESEE trial at HCI. This study will establish the feasibility of using FES-PET/CT imaging to guide therapeutic decision making for functional precision oncology trials. The unique ability of FES-PET/CT to show absence of functional estrogen receptors throughout the entire body may improve confidence among research oncologists that an ER+ metastatic breast cancer patient is truly refractory to hormonal therapies which is a critical determination in the study design of the FORESEE trial.
Estrogen Receptor Positive Breast Cancer
DRUG: [18F]Fluoroestradiol (FES) PET/CT
Number of patients on the FORESEE trial refractory to all combinatorial hormonal therapies that are recruited and imaged with FES-PET/CT prior to switching to non-hormonal therapeutic agents, establish proof-of-concept to inform use of FES-PET/CT in future larger precision oncology trials, 12 weeks
Rate of concordance between FES-PET/CT imaging (positive or negative uptake) and ER status from tumor biopsy, assess FES-PET/CT concordance with ER status from patient-derived organoid models and concordance between FES-PET/CT imaging and patient-derived organoid drug profiling results for predicting response to hormonal therapies, 12 weeks|Rate of concordance between positive FES-PET/CT scan and response to hormonal therapies from drug profiling results using patient-derived organoid models, assess FES-PET/CT concordance with ER status from patient-derived organoid models and concordance between FES-PET/CT imaging and patient-derived organoid drug profiling results for predicting response to hormonal therapies, 12 weeks
