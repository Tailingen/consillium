BS-FU01 is a follow-up study for patients treated with FluBHPVE6E7 in previous phase 1 and 2 interventional studies. The aim of the follow-up study is to assess the safety and immunogenicity of FluBHPVE6E7, changes in the HPV infection status, cervical cytology, and biodistribution after treatment with FluBHPVE6E7 in previous studies.
