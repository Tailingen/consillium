Fludarabine, Rituximab, and Lenalidomide in Minimally Treated/Untreated Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)
This phase I/II trial will combine fludarabine, rituximab, and lenalidomide in untreated or minimally treated (Phase I only) CLL patients, employing fixed doses of fludarabine and rituximab, using a schedule similar to that examined by investigators at MD Anderson (J Clin Oncol 23(18):4079-88, 2005). Given that the optimal dose and schedule is not currently known, this trial will perform a phase I component followed by a phase II examination to further explore this regimen's activity.

While progress has been made in treating CLL patients over the last decade, a cure remains elusive for many patients treated with standard therapies. The combination of fludarabine, a purine analog, and rituximab, a monoclonal antibody, is an effective and frequently used therapy for CLL. However, this drug combination is associated with increased toxicity. Lenalidomide has been shown to be less toxic and has been used to treat hematologic malignancies including CLL. We propose this Phase I/Phase II study to examine the combination of lenalidomide with a rituximab/fludarabine backbone.
