D-0316 First Time in Patients Ascending Dose Study
This is a phase 1 open label multicentre study of D-0316 administered orally in patients with advanced NSCLC who have progressed following prior therapy with an EGFR-TKI (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor agent). This is the first time this drug has ever been tested in patients, and so it will help to understand safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary anti-tumour activity of ascending doses of D-0316.
