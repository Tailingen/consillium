Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of CUDC-907 in Patients With RR DLBCL, Including Patients With MYC Alterations
This is a Phase 2, open-label, multicenter trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CUDC-907 in subjects 18 years and older with Relapsed/Refractory (RR) MYC-altered Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL).
Relapsed and/or Refractory Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma Including With Myc Alterations
DRUG: CUDC-907
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Efficacy of CUDC-907 in subjects with Relapsed/Refractory MYC-altered Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), 2 Years
Median Progression-free Survival, Efficacy of CUDC-907 in subjects with Relapsed/Refractory MYC-altered DLBCL, 1 year|Overall Survival (OS), Efficacy of CUDC-907 in subjects with Relapsed/Refractory MYC-altered DLBCL, 1 year|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Efficacy of CUDC-907 in subjects with Relapsed/Refractory MYC-altered DLBCL Note: Response is defined using Cheson 2007 criteria. CR=Complete Response; PR=Partial Response; SD=Stable Disease. a. Two-sided exact binomial 95% confidence interval. Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson 2007) was used for the assessment of response. DCR is defined as the proportion of patients having best response of complete response, partial response, or stable disease., 1 year|Number of Participants and Severity of Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), and Other Safety Parameters, Number of participants and severity of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and other safety parameters in patients receiving CUDC-907., AEs were collected for each participant for the duration that they remained on the study, on average of 4 months
Patients with RR DLBCL will be eligible for treatment with CUDC-907, as long as they have tumor tissue available that can be tested for MYC-altered disease based on one of the following:

* Fresh tumor tissue obtained from biopsy accessible lesions , or
* Archived tumor tissue (most recent available)

Subjects will be required to submit archival tumor samples (most recent available) or fresh tumor samples for central FISH and IHC testing. Subjects whose tumors have been previously characterized as MYC-altered are strongly encouraged to enter the study. For subjects who enter the study with unconfirmed MYC-altered disease, fresh tumor samples are preferred.
