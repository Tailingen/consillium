A Study on the Safety and Tolerability of Rovalpituzumab Tesirine in Japanese Patients With Advanced, Recurrent Small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a Japanese, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study. This is the first study to assess the safety and tolerability as well as explore the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and antitumor activity of rovalpituzumab tesirine in Japanese participants with advanced small cell lung cancer (SCLC).
Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Rovalpituzumab tesirine
Number of participants with dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), DLTs graded according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.03., Up to 3 weeks after the initial dose of study drug (first 3 weeks of Cycle 1)
Duration of response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the initial objective response to disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., First dose of study drug through at least 42 days after last dose; Up to a minimum 18 weeks after participant's first dose.|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants whose best overall response is either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1., First dose of study drug through at least 42 days after last dose; Up to a minimum 18 weeks after participant's first dose.|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of first dose to the date of death., First dose of study drug through long-term follow up; Up to 24 months after participant's first dose.|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS time is defined as the time from the first dose of study drug to progression or death, whichever occurs first., First dose of study drug through at least 42 days after last dose; Up to a minimum 18 weeks after participant's first dose.|Clinical benefit rate (CBR), CBR is defined as the proportion of participants whose overall response is either CR, PR, or Stable Disease (SD) according to RECIST version 1.1., First dose of study drug through at least 42 days after last dose; Up to a minimum 18 weeks after participant's first dose.
