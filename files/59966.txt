Low-dose Dasatinib as First-line Treatment for Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
Our goal is to demonstrate that 50mg of dasatinib is as effective as the full dose to induce molecular response as first line therapy in CML.
Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia
DRUG: Dasatinib 50 MG
Molecular Response at 6 months, Molecular Response define as BCR/ABL \<1%, 6 months
Early Molecular Response at 3 and 6 months, Early Molecular Response define as \<10%, 3 and 6 months
We will give 50mg of dasatinib daily since the diagnosis for up to 6 months, for the first 2-4 weeks we will evaluate hematic biometry to registry hematic response, at months 3 and 6 a BCR/ABL PCR will be taken to evaluate molecular response.
