A Study DHP107, a Novel Oral Paclitaxel Formulation, in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumours or Gastric Cancer
A study of DHP107, a novel oral paclitaxel formulation, to determine maximum tolerated dose and recommended dose for phase II trial in patients with advanced solid cancer and explore efficacy of DHP107 in patients with gastric cancer
Solid Tumor|Stage IV Gastric Cancer
DRUG: Paclitaxel
Number of participants with dose limiting toxicity(DLT) to determine maximum tolerated dose(MTD), To determine the dose at which no more than one patient out of up to 6 patients at the same dose level experience a drug-related dose-limiting toxicity, First cycle of treatment (4-week)
To identify the dose limiting toxicity(DLT) and the safety (toxicity) of DHP107, Adverse events are evaluated in the first cycle(4-week) according to NCI CTCAE v4.0, First cycle of treatment (4-week)|To evaluate efficacy(tumor response) by RECIST criteria version 1.1, every 8 weeks (Â±1 week)|PK parameters for DHP107 derived from determining their plasma concentrations using validated assays., First cycle of treatment (4-week)
1. Primary objective To determine the maximum tolerated dose and the recommended dose for phase 2 clinical trial for the repeated administration of DHP107 (oral paclitaxel) on advanced solid cancer patients
2. Secondary objectives

   * To identify the dose limiting toxicity and the safety (toxicity) of DHP107
   * To evaluate the efficacy (tumor response rate) of DHP107
   * To assess pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics of DHP107
