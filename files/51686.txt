A Study of Simmitinib Plus SG001 in Advanced Solid Tumors
This is an open-label Phase I/II trial of simmitinib plus SG001 in patients with advanced solid tumors. Phase I will determine and confirm the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for simmitinib in combination with SG001 in patients with advanced solid tumors. Phase 2 (Expansion) will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination in 3 cohorts at the RP2D from Phase I.
