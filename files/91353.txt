Surgical resection in patients with multiple hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) remains controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate the outcome of a consecutive cohort of patients resected for multiple HCC, without macrovascular invasion, in order to identify clinically reliable parameters to select patients for surgery.
