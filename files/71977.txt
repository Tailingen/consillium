a Single-arm, Single-center, Open Clinical Study
This trial plans to enroll many patients with advanced solid tumors to complete GK01 cell transfusion, including but not limited to advanced gastric cancer, esophageal cancer, cervical cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer. For patients with advanced solid tumors eligible for inclusion, autologous tumor-reactive T cells (experimental drug GK01) were cultured and prepared, and a certain dose of GK01 cells was given according to the cell transfusion plan, and the safety and tolerability of the patients after transfusion were observed. Exploratory evaluation of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profiles following reinfusion and initial evaluation of efficacy of investigational drug GK01 cells according to RECIST 1.1 criteria.
