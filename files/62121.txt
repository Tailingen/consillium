A Population-based Prospective Study of Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (CRC) Patients in Finland
* A population-based prospective study to evaluate clinical behaviour, resectability and survival in 1st line metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) patients in Finland
* Primary objective: To assess clinical behaviour of metastatic colorectal cancer and overall resectability, postoperative morbidity and outcomes after resection
* Secondary objectives: To assess treatments for mCRC; To assess efficacy of chemotherapy and targeted drugs with overall response rates (ORR), failure free survival (FFS), progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS); To radiologically assess tumour density and morphology, and assess alternative radiologic response evaluation in comparison with RECIST response criteria; To evaluate whole blood, plasma, serum and tumour block biomarkers and DNA polymorphisms that may predict drug effects, resectability and clinical behaviour of the tumour
