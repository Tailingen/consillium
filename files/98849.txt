Phase IIa Study of Nimotuzumab to Treat Colorectal Cancer
Nimotuzumab is an IgG1 humanized monoclonal antibody that recognized an epitope located in the extra cellular domain of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Clinical efficacy has been shown in adult with head and neck cancer. The study assessed the safety, and efficacy of the combination of Nimotuzumab administered concomitantly with chemotherapy in patients with advanced colorectal cancer.

DRUG: Nimotuzumab|DRUG: Irinotecan
The rate of grade 3/4 toxicity, The rate of grade 3/4 toxicity, defined as the proportion or frequency of patients who experience toxicity reactions that are classified as grade 3 or grade 4 according to CTCAE v5.0., 3 months
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), Rate of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) after infusion of nimotuzumab. The highest dose at which 0 or 1 DLT occurs in 6 DLT-evaluable subjects will be declared the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)., 3 months|The complete response rate, Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by CT/MRI: Complete Response (CR), defined as the disappearance of all target lesions., 3 months|The partial response rate, Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by CT/MRI: Partial Response (PR), defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions., 3 months|The disease control rate, Disease control rate (DCR), including complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) and stable disease(SD). Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by CT/MRI: CR, disappearance of all target lesions; PR, at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions. SD, neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD (PD, defined as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions)., 3 months
Nimotuzumab and Irinotecan will be administered to the patient until disease progression or development of toxicity preclude further treatment. Irinotecan will be administered once every 14 days, the dosage is 180mg/m2; Nimotuzumab treatment be divided 3 levels: 200mg/w, 400mg/w, 600mg/w, weekly. The patients'blood test and liver and renal function tests will be monitored weekly, a physical exam and reassessment of the tumor will be performed and every 6 weeks, when the total result is the CR or PR, the result of the 6th and the 12th week should be compared.
