Autologous Dendritic Cell Vaccine in Patients With Soft Tissue Sarcoma
The purpose of this study is to achieving a six-month progression free survival (PFS) of patients receiving autologous dendritic cell vaccine (ADKV) loaded with allogeneic tumor lysate expression of cancer-testis antigens (CTA) in patients with soft tissue sarcomas
Sarcoma|Neoplasms, Connective and Soft Tissue
BIOLOGICAL: Autologous dendritic cell vaccine
Achieving a six-month progression free survival (PFS) of patients receiving ADKV with soft tissue sarcomas, Achieving a six-month time to progression (PFS) 40% of patients receiving ADKV loaded with allogeneic tumor lysate expressing PTA in patients with soft tissue sarcomas, 6 month
Median progression-free survival, The length of time during and after the treatment of a disease, such as cancer, that a patient lives with the disease but it does not get worse. In a clinical trial, measuring the progression-free survival is one way to see how well a new treatment works, 6 month|Median overall survival, The length of time from either the date of diagnosis or the start of treatment for a disease, such as cancer, that half of the patients in a group of patients diagnosed with the disease are still alive. In a clinical trial, measuring the median overall survival is one way to see how well a new treatment works, 6 month|Objective response rate, The percentage of patients whose cancer shrinks or disappears after treatment., 6 mounth|Assess biological response of tumors, Сhanging level of T lymphocytes subpopulation in peripheral blood, 6 mounth
Vaccination is carried out on the planned days ± 3 days

1. All examinations must be performed before the vaccine is administered.

   * Full physical examination.
   * Assessment of vital signs (blood pressure, temperature, heart rate), the general condition of the patient and physical activity.
   * Evaluation of concomitant therapy.
   * Assessment of vital signs.
   * Laboratory safety and immunological indicators
   * Assessment of adverse events, symptoms and syndromes of the disease.
2. Introduction of CV in accordance with the dose determined for a given vaccination (see section 9.2. - procedures for delivery and use)
3. After administration, patients are observed for at least 1 hour. An assessment of vital indicators. Undesirable effects detected at the introduction are recorded.
