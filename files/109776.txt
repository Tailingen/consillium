This is a prospective, open-label, one-arm, multicenter clinical trial, aimed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of crizotinib combined with etoposide followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for relapsed and refractory ALK-positive ALCL. A total of 20 patients are planned to be enrolled into the study. Patients with diagnosis of relapsed and refractory ALK-positive ALCL will be treated with crizotinib plus etoposide capsules followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The primary end points are objective responder rate (ORR) and progression free survival(PFS) and the secondary end points include overall survival(OS) , and adverse events.
