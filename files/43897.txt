Safety and Efficacy of ALLO-605 an Anti-BCMA Allogeneic CAR T Cell Therapy in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of the ALLO-605-201 study is to assess the safety, efficacy, and cell kinetics of ALLO605 in adults with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma after a lymphodepletion regimen comprising fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and ALLO-647.
Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma
GENETIC: ALLO-605|BIOLOGICAL: ALLO-647|DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide
Phase 1: Proportion of subjects experiencing Dose Limiting Toxicities at increasing doses of ALLO-605 that will determine MTD/MAD and select the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ALLO-605., Dose limiting toxicity is defined as protocol-defined ALLO-605 related adverse events with onset within 28 days following infusion, 28 days|Phase 1: Proportion of patients experiencing Dose Limiting Toxicities with ALLO-647 [administered in combination with fludarabine/cyclophosphamide administered prior to ALLO-605], Dose-limiting toxicity is defined as protocol-defined ALLO-647-related adverse events with onset within 30 days following 1st infusion, 30 days|Phase 2: To assess clinical efficacy of ALLO-605 as measured by overall response rate (ORR), 12 months of study follow-up
