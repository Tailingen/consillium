The target population of interest in this study is participants with high-risk HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer. The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of T-DXd neoadjuvant therapy.

Participants will be randomised to one of 3 arms: T-DXd monotherapy (Arm A), T-DXd followed by THP (Arm B), or ddAC-THP (Arm C).
