PET/CT Imaging of uPAR-expression in Patients With Neuroendocrine Tumors Using 68Ga-NOTA-AE105
The aim of this non-randomised, prospective study is to investigate the applicability and prognostic value of uPAR PET/CT with the radioligand 68Ga-NOTA-AE105 in patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs).
Neuroendocrine Tumors
DRUG: One injection of 68Ga-NOTA-AE105|DEVICE: PET/CT
uPAR PET/CT imaging of patients with neuroendocrine tumors, The radioligand 68Ga-NOTA-AE105 can be used to visualize neuroendocrine tumors (grade G1-G3), 1 hour
uPAR PET/CT prognostic factor for progression free survival, The uptake of the 68Ga-NOTA-AE105 in neuroendocrine tumor lesions (quantified as Standard Uptake Values) is associated with progression free survival (PFS) neuroendocrine tumors (grade G1-G3), 12 months|uPAR PET/CT prognostic factor for overall and disease specific survival, The uptake of the 68Ga-NOTA-AE105 in neuroendocrine tumor lesions (quantified as Standard Uptake Values) is associated with overall and disease specific free survival (PFS) neuroendocrine tumors (grade G1-G3), 12 months
68Ga-NOTA-AE105 is a radioligand targeting urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), which is a promising imaging biomarker of tumor aggressiveness. A total of 120 NET patients will be subjected to a uPAR-PET/CT scan. Follow-up will be performed (from the time of the angiogenesis PET/ CT) at 6 months for disease specific survival (DSS) and a 1 year follow-up for PFS and OS. The uptake of 68Ga-NOTA-AE105 in tumor lesions will be quantified as Standardized Uptake Values (SUVmax/SUVmean) and compared with PFS, DSS and OS (dichotomized above/below median SUVmax and analyzed by Kaplan-Meier)
