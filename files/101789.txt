Abatacept and the Risk of Cancer: a Case Non-case Analysis in VigiBase
There are very few data on the safety of Biologic Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (bDMARDs), especially abatacept which compared to Tumor Necrosis Factor α (TNFα) inhibitors has distinct mechanism of action. Abatacept is a recombinant fusion protein of human Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and the Fc region of human immunoglobulin gamma-1 (IgG1). This CTLA4-fusion protein blocks the signal of T cell activation by binding to CD80 and CD86.

Recently, the investigator's study found in a US cohort of 64,000 patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) a potential signal for a higher risk of cancer overall and particularly non-melanoma skin cancer with abatacept compared to other bDMARDs (article in press). These results were in accordance with another prospective cohort study of the public health care system in Sweden, showing an increased risk of NMSC in abatacept users compared with TNFα inhibitors. As these results warrant replication, the present study will assess whether abatacept is associated with an increased risk of reporting overall cancer and specific cancer, including breast, lung, lymphoma, cervical, melanoma and NMSC, compared to other bDMARDs.
