This single-arm, open-label, multiple-center clinical trial aims to study the efficacy and safety of chiauranib in the treatment of patients with advanced or unresectable soft tissue sarcoma, and to explore potential biomarkers associated with chiauranib, as well as their correlation and clinical benefits.
