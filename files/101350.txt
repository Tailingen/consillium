Bone Metastasis on the Survival of Gefitinib Effective Patients
Gefitinib is a selective small molecule epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI), it's curative effect on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been confirmed by a number of prospective clinical trials. The researches aim to analysis whether bone metastasis could affect the survival of NSCLC patients who were effective in Gefitinib treatment over 6 months.
Overal Survival, Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Gefitinib
Overal survival of patients, The 5-year survival of NSCLC patients with or without bone metastasis, 5 years
Survival of patients with both bone metastasis and brain metastasis, Survival of patients with both bone metastasis and brain metastasis, 3 years
The epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) have inhibitory effects on cell apoptosis, cell growth, angiogenesis and metastasis of tumor cell. The advent of EGFR-TKI significantly improved the clinical efficacy and safety of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatment. Compelling study also demonstrate Gefitinib may be effective in the treatment of bone metastases. For NSCLC patients who were effective in EGFR-TKI treatment, whether bone metastasis would shorten the survival time of the patients or reduce the quality of life of patients is worth studying. The researches aim to analysis whether bone metastasis could affect the survival of NSCLC patients who were effective in Gefitinib treatment over 6 months.
