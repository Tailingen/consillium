A Study to Assess the Safety and Tolerability of RC88 for Patients With Advanced Solid Tumours
The purpose of this study is to allow RC88 treatment of patients with advanced solid tumours to assess the safety and tolerability of clinical pharmacology studies
Advanced Solid Tumours
DRUG: RC88
RP2D, Incidence of DLT (dose limiting toxicity) of RC88, 28 days after first treatment
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective Response Rate was defined as the percentage of participants with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), 24 months|Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of RC88, Dose Escalation and Expansion Part, pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 5, 8, 24, 48, 96, 168 hours|Terminal Half Life (t1/2) of RC88, Dose Escalation and Expansion Part, pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 5, 8, 24, 48, 96, 168 hours|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression-free Survival (PFS) (median) was determined using the number of months measured from the initial date of treatment to the date of documented progression, or the date of death (in the absence of progression) of participants. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., 24 months
The main purpose of this Phase I study is to test RC88 at different dose levels to see if it is safe and well tolerated when given once every 2 weeks.
