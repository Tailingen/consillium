Oncoliq: Test for Early Breast Cancer Detection.
Oncoliq is a novel early breast cancer detection test based on liquid biopsies and microRNAs. This innovative test will allow improving the accuracy of cancer detection which will impact on health, reducing the patient mortality and health costs.

To develop this test, it has been finished the preclinical PHASE I: in laboratory animals; PHASE II: exploratory clinical phase for the discovery of candidate biomarkers in breast cancer patients and PHASE III: clinical validation of biomarkers showing that Oncoliq has 91% of sensitivity.

Currently it is been setting up a "pilot test" for breast cancer to enrol 500 woman volunteers without previous cancer diagnosis that go to the annual medical control. The results of the pilot test will give the accuracy for early breast cancer detection.
