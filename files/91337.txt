Study on Efficacy, Pharmacokinetics, and Safety of Two Subcutaneous Injections of Triptorelin Embonate 6 Month Formulation in Patients With Advanced Prostate Cancer
The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of triptorelin embonate 22.5 mg 6-month formulation administered by the subcutaneous (under the skin) route in:

* achieving castrate levels of testosterone (\< 1.735 nmol/L) on Day 29 \[i.e., 28 days after investigational medicinal product (IMP) injection\], and
* in maintaining serum testosterone castrate levels from Month 2 (Day 57) to end of Month 12 (Day 337) in participants with advanced prostate cancer.
