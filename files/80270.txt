Omitting Clinical Target Volume in Radical Treatment of Unresectable Stage III Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
Simultaneous radiotherapy followed by adjuvant immunotherapy is the standard treatment modality of unresectable stage III NSCLC. Our preliminary study confirmed that the treatment of CTV-omitted IMRT regimen did not compromise the PFS or OS and significantly reduced the incidence of severe radiation pneumonia and radiation esophagitis.

The purpose of this study was to observe the role of radiotherapy modalities that omit CTV in the context of immunotherapy for NSCLC.
