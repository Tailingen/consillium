Safety and Efficacy of Autologous NK Cell Adjuvant Therapy for Relapsed/Refractory Non-Hodgkin's B-cell Lymphoma
This study was a single-arm trial of autologous NK cell adjuvant therapy for relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma. The locations isXiangyang No.1 People's Hospital, Hubei University of Medicine. The population was relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma. The sample size was 33. The intervention was R-GemOx regimen combined with autologous NK cells. The dose of autologous NK cells was body surface area x (2-4) x 109 cells. The course of treatment was once every 14 days. The primary outcome measure was ORR. The duration of assessment was for each treatment cycle, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, 3 years, and 5 years of treatment.
