A Clinical Trial Evaluating the Effect of Pharmacological Ascorbate on Radiation Therapy for Pancreatic Cancer Patients
Radiation therapy improves cancer cure rates by killing cancer cells but it also contributes to long-term side effects in cancer survivors by unintentionally damaging normal organs such as the intestine. This research will what side effects patients with cancer experience, if high dose vitamin C helps reduce these side effects, and if high dose vitamin C increases the survival of patients with pancreatic cancer. We will meet with patients during the study to better understand their experience during their cancer treatment. In the long term, our research could provide a new way help cancer survivors avoid many permanent side effects of cancer treatments.
Pancreatic Neoplasm
DRUG: Ascorbate|DRUG: Gemcitabine|RADIATION: radiation therapy
Overall survival (OS), The study will determine the time (calculated in months) between study day 1 and death from any cause. After 10 years post-treatment, dates will be censored to date of last follow-up, Up to 5 years post treatment
Progression free survival (PFS), From radiation day 1 to documented disease progression in CT imaging as described by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. Measured in months., Up to 5 years post-treatment|Toxicity over time (ToxT), Toxicity over time will be assessed by summarizing treatment emergent adverse events by system organ class and/or preferred term, type of adverse event, and severity. Elapsed days of toxicity will be summarized., Treatment day 1 to 30 days post-treatment|Metastasis free survival (MFS), time from treatment initiation (day 1) to the date of first documentation of disease progression outside of the pelvis (per RECIST 1.1), Up to 5 years post-treatment|Resection rate, Rate of patients who undergo resection of tumor, Within 2 month post-radiation|Adverse event frequency and categorization, Categorize and quantify adverse events using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, v 5), Weekly for the first 6 weeks and then at follow-up through 5 years post-treatment|Patient reported outcome measure: Vaizey Incontinence questionnaire, Patient reported outcome measure of bowel side effects collected at pre-specified timepoints., Treatment day 1 to 5 years post-treatment|Quality of life: Modified Inflammatory Bowel Disease questionnaire, Patient completed quality of life form collected at pre-specified timepoints., Treatment day 1 to 5 years post-treatment|Pathologic characteristics, â€¢ Mucosal ulcerations, inflammatory cell infiltration, collage deposition, and microvascular changes will be assessed, At surgery
Exploration of patient reported outcomes during combined therapy [qualitative string], Semi-structured one-on-one interviews for thematic analysis, During treatment phase and up to 5 years post-treatment
This is a randomized phase 2 study is designed to determine initial efficacy and assess adverse events, and quantify pathologic evidence of intestinal radiation injury. The ascorbate is infused before, during, and after the external beam radiation therapy treatment. Each ascorbate infusion is 75 grams (roughly the same amount of vitamin C from 1,000 oranges).

For patients eligible for this trial, standard treatment for their cancer includes radiation therapy combined with weekly gemcitabine (a chemotherapy).

Participants will:

* be randomized (like flipping a coin) to receive the investigational treatment (pharmacological ascorbate plus gemcitabine plus radiation) or standard treatment only (gemcitabine plus radiation)
* receive gemcitabine (a chemotherapy) once a week for up to 6 weeks of therapy (all participants)
* receive radiation treatments are given once a day, Monday through Friday (all participants).
* have routine doctor's visits and be asked about any side effects they are experiencing (all participants).
* be interviewed to discuss their side effects, how it impacts their life, and describe their recent activities.
* receive pharmacological ascorbate intravenously ascorbate during their daily radiation therapy treatments (if randomized to receive the investigational treatment).

Once the patient completes radiation, the ascorbate infusions are also completed. However, the patient will need to return for regular follow-up care at University of Iowa. We are interested in the long-term side effects of radiation - which may not develop for years - so it is important the participant return to radiation oncology for follow-up. We will also conduct interviews at that time to review the side effects and how they impact the participant's quality of life.
