Study of VA Combined With HAAG Regimen in Newly Diagnosed Intermediate and High-risk AML Patients
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of VA combined with HAAG in the induction treatment of newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia.
Intermediate Risk Acute Myeloid Leukemia|High Risk Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: venetoclax, azacitidine and HAAG regimen
Composite complete response rate (CRc; CR+CRi), CRc includes complete response CR and CRi; CR was defined as \< 5% bone marrow blasts in an aspirate with spicules, no blasts with Auer rods or persistence of extramedullary disease, and independent of transfusions; CRi: was defined as\<5% bone marrow blasts, either ANC\<1×10\^9/L or platelets\<100×10\^9/L, transfusion independence but with persistence of cytopenia., Day 28-35 of induction course
Partial remission (PR), PR was defined as decrease of at least 50% in the percentage of blasts to 5-25% in the bone marrow aspirate and the normalization of blood counts., Day 28-35 of induction course|Number of adverse events, adverse events are evaluated with CTCAE V5.0., 2 years|Relapse-free survival (RFS), time from clinical CRc (CR and CRi) to the first relapse or death, 3 years|Overall survival (OS), time from the first day of treatment to death or lost to follow-up for any cause., 3 years
This is a single-center, single-arm, prospective clinical study in newly diagnosed intermediate and high-risk AML patients. The patients will receive venetoclax, azacitidine combined with HAAG regimen in the induction treatment.
