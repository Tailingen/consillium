Biomarkers in Samples From Patients With Endometrial Cancer
This research study is studying biomarkers in samples from patients with endometrial cancer. Studying samples from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

OTHER: Laboratory Biomarker Analysis
Clinical sensitivity and specificity of epigenetic biomarkers in a cohort of blind samples (Project 2), ROC curves used to describe the discriminatory characteristics of candidate biomarkers. From the competing risk model, the coefficients of the clinicopathological covariates and the hypermethylation levels of each biomarker will indicate the association of these factors with each of the four types of survivals. The significance of association will be indicated by P-values, and hazard rates will also be provided., 1 month|Confirmation of CpG island loci frequently hypermethylated in EECs exhibiting recurrence (Project 2), Proportion of methylated samples and 95% confidence interval calculated for each marker, recurrent and non-recurrent samples.

For each marker, the nuclear positivity and cytoplasmic positivity will be evaluated separately.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Assess the frequency and spectrum of mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) in low-, intermediate-, and/or high-risk endometrioid endometrial cancer from GOG-0210. (Project 1) II. Determine the relationship between FGFR2 mutation and clinicopathologic variables including disease-free and overall survival in low-, intermediate-, and/or high-risk endometrial cancer from GOG-0210. (Project 1) III. Identify the cognate FGF ligands and receptors expressed in normal endometrium and endometrial cancers, and examine their expression on multiple tissue microarrays for GOG-0210 to determine their association with clinical outcome. (Project 1) IV. Identify epigenetic biomarkers (differential methylation of CpG island loci) associated with recurrence and disease progression in endometrioid endometrial cancer from Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM). (Project 2) V. Confirm epigenetic biomarkers (differential methylation of CpG island loci) associated with recurrent and disease progression in endometrioid endometrial cancer from GOG-0210. (Project 2) VI. Define the performance (sensitivity and specificity) of epigenetic biomarkers associated with recurrence and disease progression in endometrioid endometrial cancer from an independent cohort of cases from GOG-0210. (Project 2) VII. Develop a molecular screening regimen to compliment family history risk assessment to identify carriers of Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC)-related and other forms of inherited endometrial cancer from GOG-0210 that was not ascertained by family history. (Project 3) VIII. Estimate the prevalence of HNPCC-related and other forms of inherited endometrial cancer in GOG-0210. (Project 3) IX. Define the relationship between defective DNA mismatch repair and clinical and epidemiological factors in GOG-0210. (Project 3) X.
