Incidence of Intracranial Hemorrhage in Glioma Patients With Venous Thromboembolism Converted From LMWH to Apixaban
Glioma patients with history of venous thromboembolism (VTE) treated on low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and who decided with their physician to convert to Apixaban (oral drug) will be enrolled into our study and will collect data regarding recurrent VTE and Intracranial hemorrhage and the incidence of these events.
Glioma, Malignant
OTHER: Observation of ICH and VTE
Intracranial Hemorrhage (ICH) event incidence rate, Observe subject to determine the incidence of ICH during standard of care (SOC) observations., 1 year
Deep venous thromboembolism (VTE) event incidence rate, Observe subject to determine the incidence of VTE during SOC observations., 1 year
Primary Objectives To estimate the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in glioma patients with history of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after the conversion from low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) injections to oral Apixaban.

Secondary Objective To estimate the incidence of recurrent VTE in glioma patients with history of venous thromboembolism after the conversion from low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) injections to oral Apixaban.
