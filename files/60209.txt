Treatment of Hematological Malignancy With Novel CAR-T Cells.
This is a single arm, open-label, early phase I study, to determine the safety and efficacy of Novel CAR-T cell therapy in Hematological Malignancy treatment.

The Novel CAR-T contains either a scFv plus a PD-L1 blocker, or two scFvs, in a cytokine complex based outer memberane structure, this kind of structure enables the CAR-T cells to simultaneously target one or two targets on the tumor cell surface and enhance CAR-T cell persistence in tumor microenvironmentï¼Œas well as stimulating innate T/NK cell activation and expansion.
