A Study to Determine the Safety and Tolerability of 2 Concentrations of QLS-101
Safety and tolerability study of 2 concentrations of QLS-101 for adult subjects with Sturge Weber Syndrome (SWS)-related glaucoma due to elevated episcleral venous pressure (EVP).
Sturge-Weber Syndrome (SWS)|Glaucoma|Glaucoma Congenital|Ocular Hypertension
DRUG: QLS-101ophthalmic solution 1%|DRUG: QLS-101ophthalmic solution 2%
Ocular adverse events (AEs), Standard safety endpoint, ocular AEs, (including elevated IOP), 56 days, including a 14-day washout|Visual acuity, Standard safety endpoint, best corrected visual acuity, Snellen score, change from baseline, 56 days, including a 14-day washout|Enhance depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT), Standard safety endpoint, EDI-OCT, corneal thickness, 56 days, including a 14-day washout|Slit lamp exam, Standard safety endpoint, slit lamp exam, abnormalities, changes from baseline, 56 days, including a 14-day washout|Dilated fundus exam, Fundus exam, abnormalities, changes from baseline, 56 days, including a 14-day washout
Ocular hypotensive efficacy, Mean change in IOP from baseline following 14 days dosing, 14 days after each dosing timepoint is completed
Masked, randomized, single site, crossover study to compare 2 concentrations of QLS-101. Subjects will be randomized to one of 2 concentrations of QLS-101 for the first 14 days of daily dosing, and after a 14-day washout period they will be crossed over to the other concentration for another 14 days of daily dosing. Dose assignment is masked to patient and investigator.
