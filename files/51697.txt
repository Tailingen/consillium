A Phase I Study of ONO-4538HSC in Subjects With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is a multicenter, open-label, uncontrolled, phase I study to evaluate the tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of ONO-4538HSC administered subcutaneously in participants with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. This study consists of the tolerability confirmation part to determine the recommended dose for Japanese participants by evaluating the DLTs and the expansion part to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics and to explore the efficacy.
