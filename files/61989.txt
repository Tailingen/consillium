Phase 1b Maintenance Therapy Study of ONT-10 in Patients With Solid Tumors
This is an open label phase 1b maintenance therapy study to evaluate the long-term safety, immunogenicity, and anti-tumor effects of repeat-dose vaccination with ONT-10 in patients who have demonstrated safety and clinical benefit on the original ONT-10-001 phase 1 study.
Solid Tumors
BIOLOGICAL: ONT-10
Incidence and severity of adverse events and lab abnormalities, 20-60 weeks
Immunogenicity and anti-tumor activity, Assessments of humoral and cellular immune response and overall response as per irRC and RECIST 1.1., 20-60 weeks
Open label Phase 1b maintenance therapy study to evaluate the long-term safety, immunogenicity, and anti-tumor effects of repeat-dose vaccination with ONT-10 in patients with previously treated Stage 3 or 4 solid tumors with histologies that have been associated with expression of the MUC1 antigen as described in the medical literature. Patients must have previously been enrolled on the Phase 1 clinical trial ONT-10-001, completed all treatment and follow-up through at least 12 weeks, experienced no dose limiting toxicity, and experienced no progression of disease per the immune-related Response Criteria. Patients will receive maintenance ONT-10 every 6 weeks.
