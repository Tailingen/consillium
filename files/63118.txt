18F-DCFPyL PET/MRI in Regional Nodal&Distant Metastases Detection in Intermediate &HR Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this research study is to see if patients' tumor can be identified by 18F-DCFPyL PET/MRI scan. The radioactive study agent, 18FDCFPyL, combined with PET/MRI scan may be able to identify smaller tumors than the standard of care contrast-enhanced CT or MRI scan.
