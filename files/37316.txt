Carmustine Wafers Plus Irinotecan in Treating Patients With Recurrent Supratentorial High Grade Gliomas
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of carmustine wafers plus irinotecan in treating patients with recurrent supratentorial high grade gliomas.
Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors
DRUG: carmustine|DRUG: irinotecan hydrochloride|DRUG: polifeprosan 20 with carmustine implant|PROCEDURE: surgical procedure
OBJECTIVES:

* Define the maximum tolerated dose of irinotecan given in combination with Gliadel wafers (carmustine) in patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme, anaplastic astrocytoma, or gliosarcoma.
* Define the toxicity of irinotecan given in combination with Gliadel wafers in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

All patients undergo surgical resection. At the time of surgery, up to eight Gliadel wafers (containing carmustine) are implanted in the resected tumor cavity.

Cohorts of 3 patients each receive escalating doses of irinotecan IV over 90 minutes once weekly within 3 weeks after Gliadel wafer implantation. One course of treatment consists of 4 weeks of irinotecan and 2 weeks of rest. If 1 patient experiences dose limiting toxicity (DLT) at a dose level, an additional 3 patients are entered at that same dose level. If 2 patients experience DLT, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been surpassed and a total of 6 patients are treated at the previous dose level. The MTD is defined as the highest dose in which no more than 1 of 6 patients experiences DLT.

Treatment continues for up to 12 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity and disease progression.

Patients are followed for at least 4 months.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 18 patients will be accrued into this study over 9 months.
