The Laparotomy Study
The depth of neuromuscular blockade (NMB) during surgery may cause a clinical dilemma between optimal surgical conditions and the risk of postoperative residual blockade.

The aim of the study is to investigate if intense NMB improves surgical conditions during operation in patients scheduled for elective open upper abdominal surgery.
Gastrointestinal Cancer
DRUG: Group STANDARD: Rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg followed by bolus rocuronium according to standard treatment combined with saline infusion (placebo).|DRUG: Group DEEP: Rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg followed by rocuronium infusion with target level PTC 0-1 combined with bolus saline (placebo) mimicking standard treatment.
Surgical Rating Score, The final score for the surgical conditions of a patient defined as the average of all scores provided during the surgical procedure. (Rated on a 5 point subjective rating scale; 1: extremely poor, 2: poor, 3: acceptable, 4: good, 5: optimal), After randomization every 30 minutes during the operation from first incision to last suture of fascial closure, up to 300 minutes
The Surgical Rating Score During Fascial Closure, After last suture of fascial closure surgical conditions are rated on a 5 point scale, Immediatly after fascial closure
