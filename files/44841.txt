Prevention and Screening Towards Elimination of Cervical Cancer
The research project applies the protocol of the World Health Organisation for screening of cervical cancer, with testing of hrHPV as first screening, followed by Visual Inspection of the cervix with Acetic Acid for hrHPV-positive women and for women with minor lesions thermo-ablation of affected areas. This procedure is applied in Uganda, India and Bangladesh. In Slovakia hrHPV-positive women are offered Pap-smear and for women with Pap IV lis excision.

The project performs community sensitisation and mobilisation in dedicated geographical areas and populations, to inform women and relatives about the importance of screening for cervical cancer.

To eligible women self-tests for hrHPV are offered, which can be applied at home and investigated in dedicated field-laboratories. Women who are hrHPV positive are invited for further diagnosis. In Uganda, India and Bangladesh Visual Inspection of the cervix with Acetic Acid is performed. In Slovakia Pap-smear. In case dysplasia is found, further treatment is performed with cryotherapy or thermo-ablation. Cases of suspect invasive cervical cancer are referred to hospitals for diagnosis and treatment.
