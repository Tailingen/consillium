CFI-400945 in Patients With Advanced/Metastatic Breast Cancer
The standard or usual treatment for this disease is to undergo chemotherapy to slow the spread of the disease and relieve some symptoms of cancer. Patients will have already had at least one chemotherapy treatment for their disease at this stage.

CFI-400945 is a new type of drug for breast cancer. Laboratory tests show that it works by blocking a specific protein called Polo-like Kinase 4 (PLK4) that is involved in cancer cell growth. CFI-400945 may slow down the growth of cancer cells or may cause cancer cells to die. This drug has been shown to shrink tumours in animals and has been studied in some patients and appears well tolerated with little side effects. CFI-400945 seems promising but it is not clear if it can offer better results than standard therapy.
