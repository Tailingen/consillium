Trial of LAVA-1207 in Patients with Therapy Refractory Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) Resistant Prostate Cancer
This is a phase 1/2a, first-in-human study to evaluate Safety, Tolerability, PK, PD, Immunogenicity, and Antitumor Activity of LAVA-1207 alone or with low dose interleukin-2 or Pembrolizumab, in patients with therapy refractory metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer.
