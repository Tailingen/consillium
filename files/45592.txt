A Lithium-containing Mouthwash Prevention and Treatment of Oral Mucositis and Dysgeusia in Patients Undergoing Radiotherapy
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of lithium-containing mouthwash for prevention and treatment of oral mucositis and dysgeusia in patients undergoing radiotherapy for malignant head and neck tumors.
Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma|Malignant Head and Neck Tumors
DRUG: lithium-containing mouthwash|DRUG: Plcacebo mouthwash|DRUG: lithium-containing mouthwash
The incidence of Severe Oral mucositis (WHO grade ≥3), Oral mucositis is assessed by trained physicians according to World Health Organization (WHO) oral toxicity Scale., From the start of radiotherapy to 8 weeks after completion of radiotherapy
Xerostomia, Patients self-rated xerostomia according to summated xerostomia inventory (SXI), and researchers measured saliva flow rates., 1 week before radiotherapy ; at the middle of radiotherapy (3 weeks after the start of radiotherapy) ; at the end of radiotherapy (the last radiation dose received, usually 6 or 6.5 weeks); and 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after the end of radiotherapy|Patients' quality of life assessment of EORTC QLQ-C30 and H&N35 questionnaires., EORTC QLQ-C30 and H\&N35 questionnaires, 1 week before radiotherapy; at the end of radiotherapy(the last radiation dose received, usually 6 or 6.5 weeks); ; and 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after the end of radiotherapy|Adverse events, Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 5.0 version, From the first day of radiotherapy to the day of the last radiation dose received, usually 6 or 6.5 weeks|Mouth and throat soreness (MTS) scores, Patients report mouth and throat soreness (MTS) scores (Likert scale 1 to 5) via the oral mucositis weekly questionnaire （OMWQ）. Higher score indicates more severe symptoms., The time period is the period from the start of radiotherapy to the completion of radiotherapy.The evaluation period is approximately 6 weeks and 6 1/2 weeks|The duration of Severe Oral mucositis (WHO grade ≥3), The first determination of SOM to the first instance of non-severe OM (WHO grade \<3), without a subsequent instance of SOM. Patients without observed SOM were assigned a duration of 0 days., From the start of radiotherapy to 8 weeks after completion of radiotherapy|The time to onset of Severe Oral mucositis (WHO grade ≥3), Time from the first day of radiotherapy to the first determination of SOM. Patients without observed SOM were assigned onset days of 6 or 6.5 weeks., From the start of radiotherapy to 8 weeks after completion of radiotherapy|Taste function, Patients self-rated dysgeusia, Electrogustometer test and taste strips test., 1 week before radiotherapy ; at the middle of radiotherapy (3 weeks after the start of radiotherapy) ; at the end of radiotherapy (the last radiation dose received, usually 6 or 6.5 weeks); and 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after the end of radiotherapy
The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lithium-containing mouthwash in reducing the incidence, duration, and severity of severe oral mucositis (SOM) , and the incidence of dysgeusia. The main questions it aims to answer are whether lithium-containing mouthwash can effectively prevent and treat radiation-induced oral mucositis and dysgeusia, and whether it will cause adverse events in patients undergoing radiotherapy.

Participants will be instructed to use lithium-containing mouthwash or placebo mouthwash three times daily from the beginning to the end of RT.

Researchers will compare lithium-containing mouthwash group and placebo group to see if lithium-containing mouthwash are beneficial in preventing and treating oral mucositis and dysgeusia in patients undergoing radiotherapy.
