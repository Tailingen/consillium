This is a pilot study to assess the risk of progression after stopping post-autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) maintenance therapy in Minimal Residual Disease (MRD)-negative Multiple Myeloma (MM) patients. Patients will be eligible if they have a diagnosis of active MM, have completed at least 2 years of maintenance therapy post-ASCT, and meet International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria for very good partial response (VGPR) or complete response (CR). Once eligibility is confirmed and informed consent is signed, MRD testing will be performed on routine bone marrow aspirate using standard of care next-generation sequencing (NGS) testing and will be defined at a threshold of 10-6. Patients who are in VGPR or CR and sustained MRD (defined as MRD-negative at two time points that are at least 1 year apart) will go on to discontinue maintenance therapy. MRD-positive patients will continue to be treated as per standard of care (i.e., continue maintenance). Both MRD-positive and MRD-negative patients will be followed as per standard of care for progression using IMWG criteria and for MRD. Quality of life will be assessed at baseline and at 3 months after discontinuing maintenance therapy in MRD-negative patients and at baseline and at the time of next follow-up after MRD testing in MRD-positive patients. In patients who stop maintenance therapy, MRD status will be re-assessed by yearly bone marrow aspirate as per standard of care. Treatment for relapsed/ refractory myeloma will be instituted at the treating physician's discretion for documented clinical and/or biochemical progression. For all patients, a 5-mL peripheral blood and bone marrow sample will be collected and stored at the time of each standard of care bone marrow biopsy and at time of documented disease progression for correlative testing.
