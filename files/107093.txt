Intraoperative vs. Postoperative Intravesical Epirubicin Instillation for Prevention of Bladder Recurrence in High-Risk Upper Urinary Tract Urothelial Carcinoma
Upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) accounts for 5%-10% of urothelial malignancies, with up to 50% of patients developing bladder recurrence post-RNU. High-risk UTUC (≥pT2, high-grade, or N+ disease) necessitates aggressive management. Intravesical chemotherapy mitigates recurrence risk, yet optimal timing-intraoperative vs. postoperative-remains unclear. This study evaluates intraoperative epirubicin instillation during RNU compared to postoperative administration and no instillation.
