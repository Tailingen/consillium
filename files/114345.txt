Repairment of the cervico-vaginal mucosa in positive HPV women measured by normal cytology with concordant colposcopy image, Evaluate the repairment of the cervico-vaginal mucosa in positive HPV women with a cytological result of squamous atypia of undetermined significance (ASC-US) or low-grade squamous lesion (LSIL) or glandular atypia of undetermined significance (AG-US), with concordant colposcopic image, 6 months after the start of treatment., 6 months
Repairment of the cervico-vaginal mucosa in positive HPV women measured by normal cytology with concordant colposcopy image, Evaluate the repairment of the cervico-vaginal mucosa in positive HPV women with a cytological result of squamous atypia of undetermined significance (ASC-US) or low-grade squamous lesion (LSIL) or glandular atypia of undetermined significance (AG-US), with concordant colposcopic image at 3 and 12 months after the start of treatment., 3 and 12 months|Reeptielization of the cervico-vaginal mucosa measured by a likert scale., Evaluate the reeptielization of the cervico-vaginal mucosa months after the start of treatment measured by likert scale, using a total of 5 points (1 is severe ectopy + external bleeding, 2 is severe or extensive ectopy:\> 50%, 3 is moderate ectopy: 25-50%, 4 is mild ectopy: \<25% and 5 is no ectopy)., 3,6 and 12 months|Vaginal health status measured by Bachmann Index., Evaluate vaginal health status from the start of treatment measured by Bachmann Index, it contains 5 domains that evaluate elasticity, type of secretion, pH, epithelial integrity and moisture, scoring each of them from 1 to 5, considering the maximum score as the best vaginal health status., 3,6 and 12 months|Satisfaction of papilocare gel use measured by likert scale., Evaluate the satisfaction of papilocare gel use by the patients after the start of treatment measured by likert scale, it is a single-item instrument that assesses the degree of satisfaction experienced by the patient with a graded response of 7 values ranging from 1 (satisfied) to 7 (not satisfied at all)., 3 and 6 months|Therapeutic compliance, Evaluate the therapeutic compliance from the start of treatment, 3 and 6 months
Phase II, exploratory, randomized, open, controlled and parallel groups clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of exploratory gel Papilocare in the repair of the cervico-vaginal mucosa with lesions caused by HPV. All the patients included in the study will be Randomized (1:1:1) to Arm A (Papilocare schedule A), Arm B (Papilocare schedule B) and Arm C (usual clinical practice -without treatment-). Selection period of 1 month, followed by randomization and 6 months of treatment followed by a period of another 6 months without treatment. Patients will visit the site into a total of 5 visits throughout the study.
