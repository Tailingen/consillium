Afatinib as Second-line Therapy for Lung Cancer With Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Mutation
The objectives of this single-arm, open-label trial are to assess the efficacy and safety of afatinib as second line treatment for patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harbouring a common EGFR mutation who have failed first-line platinum-based chemotherapy and to demonstrate that the efficacy and safety are comparable to the results seen in previous trials.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
DRUG: Afatinib
Objective Tumour Response (Complete Response [CR], Partial Response [PR]) as Assessed by the Investigator According to the RECIST Version 1.1, As Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): Complete Response (CR), disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), =30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, Post baseline tumour-imaging was performed at every 8 weeks until Week 56 and then every 12 weeks; up to 802 days
Progression-free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by the Investigator According to RECIST 1.1., Progression-free survival (PFS) is the time from treatment start to disease progression (or death if the patient died before progression). PFS as assessed based on investigator review according to the response evaluation criteria in solid tumours (RECIST) version 1.1., Post baseline tumour-imaging was performed at every 8 weeks until Week 56 and then every 12 weeks; up to 802 days|Disease Control (CR, PR, Stable Disease [SD]) as Assessed by the Investigator According to RECIST 1.1, As Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), =30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD), neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for disease progression., Post baseline tumour-imaging was performed at every 8 weeks until Week 56 and then every 12 weeks; up to 802 days
