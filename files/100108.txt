GS-5829 in Combination With Fulvestrant or Exemestane in Women With Advanced Estrogen Receptor Positive, HER2 Negative-Breast Cancer
The primary objectives of the Phase 1b Dose Escalation part of this study are to characterize the safety and tolerability of GS-5829 in combination with exemestane or fulvestrant and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the recommended Phase 2 dose of GS-5829 in combination with fulvestrant in women with advanced estrogen receptor positive, HER2-negative (ER+/HER2-) breast cancer.

The primary objective of the Randomized Phase 2 Dose Expansion portion of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of GS-5829 in combination with fulvestrant compared to fulvestrant alone in women with advanced ER+/HER2- breast cancer.

This study was terminated early and the Phase 2 portion of the study was not conducted.
Advanced Estrogen Receptor Positive HER2- Breast Cancer
DRUG: GS-5829|DRUG: Exemestane|DRUG: Fulvestrant
Phase 1b Dose Escalation: Number of Participants Experiencing Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) Through Day 28 at Each Dose Level of GS-5829, A DLT was a toxicity as defined below:

* Grade ≥ 4 neutropenia
* Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia with fever
* Grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia
* Grade ≥ 2 bleeding (e.g., gastrointestinal, respiratory, epistaxis, purpura)
* Grade ≥ 3 or higher non-hematologic toxicity, except:

  * Grade 3 nausea or emesis with maximum duration of 48 hours on adequate medical therapy
  * Grade 3 diarrhea which persists for \< 72 hours in the absence of adequate medical therapy
* Grade ≥ 2 non-hematologic treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) that in the opinion of the investigator is of potential clinical significance such that further dose escalation would expose participants to unacceptable risk
* Treatment interruption of ≥ 7 days due to unresolved toxicity
* Grade 3 or Grade 4 elevation in aspartate transaminase (AST) or alanine transaminase (ALT) associated with a Grade 2 elevation in bilirubin that is at least possibly related to study drug, Baseline up to 28 days|Randomized Phase 2 Dose Expansion: Progression-Free Survival, Progression-Free Survival (PFS) was defined as the interval from date of randomization to the earlier of the first documented confirmed disease progression or death from any cause., Baseline up to 2 years
Phase 1b Dose Escalation: Pharmacokinetic (PK) Parameter: Cmax of GS-5829, Cmax is defined as the maximum observed concentration of drug., Predose, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours postdose on Days 1 and 15|Phase 1b Dose Escalation: PK Parameter: AUCtau of GS-5829, AUCtau is defined as concentration of drug over time (the area under the concentration verses time curve over the dosing interval)., Predose, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours postdose on Day 15|Randomized Phase 2 Dose Expansion: Overall Safety Profile as Assessed by the Percentage of Participants Experiencing Any Adverse Events (AEs), Grade 3 or 4 AEs, Treatment-Related AEs, or Abnormalities in Laboratory Tests or Electrocardiograms, Baseline up to 2 years|Randomized Phase 2 Dose Expansion: Overall Response Rate, Overall response rate (ORR) was defined as the proportion of participants who achieve complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v. 1.1 study progression criteria., Baseline up to 2 years|Randomized Phase 2 Dose Expansion: Clinical Benefit Rate, Clinical benefit rate (CBR) was defined as the proportion of participants who achieve CR, PR, or stable disease that lasts for \> 24 weeks based on RECIST v. 1.1 study progression criteria., Baseline up to 2 years|Randomized Phase 2 Dose Expansion: Overall Survival, Overall survival was defined as the interval from date of randomization to date of death from any cause., Baseline up to 2 years
