Study of OP-3136 in Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is a first-in-human, open-label, multicenter phase 1 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary efficacy of OP-3136, a lysine acetyltransferases 6A and 6B (KAT6A/B) inhibitor, in participants with advanced solid tumors.

This study consists of 2 parts: a dose escalation part (Part 1) and dose expansion part (Part 2).
Advanced or Metastatic ER+ HER2- Breast Cancer (mBC)|Advanced or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)|Advanced or Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC)
DRUG: OP-3136
Number of participants with dose-limiting toxicities in the Dose Escalation Arms, Up to 28 days|Incidence of adverse events and laboratory abnormalities, Up to 26 months
Maximum observed concentration (Cmax), Up to 26 months|Time to maximum concentration (Tmax), Up to 26 months|Area under the curve from time zero to 24 hours (AUC0-24), Up to 26 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR), Up to 26 months|Duration of Response (DOR), Up to 26 months|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), Up to 26 months
Part 1 (Dose Escalation): This part of the study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK in a range of doses of OP-3136, a lysine acetyltransferases 6A and 6B (KAT6A/B) inhibitor, administered orally once daily to participants with ER+ HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer (mBC), advanced or metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), or advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC), and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended dose/regimen for expansion (RDE).

Part 2 (Dose Expansion): This part will evaluate the recommended dose and regimen from Part 1 in the expansion cohorts of participants with ER+ HER2- mBC and participants with mCRPC.
