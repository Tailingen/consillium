Phase II Study of S-488410 to Treat Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
The investigators identified three cancer-testis antigens, as targets for cancer vaccination against lung cancer. In this clinical study, the investigators examine using a combination of three peptides from these three antigens (S-488410) the safety, immunogenicity, and antitumor effect of vaccine treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
DRUG: S-488410
Evaluation of difference in overall survival after vaccination therapy between HLA-A 24:02 and non-HLA-A 24:02 patients., Participants will be followed for the duration of vaccination therapy, an expected average of more than 1 year.
CTL response between HLA-A24:02 and non-HLA-A24:02, Participants will be followed for the duration of vaccination therapy, an expected average of more than 1 year.|PFS and ORR between HLA-A24:02 and non-HLA-A24:02, Participants will be followed for the duration of vaccination therapy, an expected average of more than 1 year.|PFS and OS between CTL response positive and negative, Participants will be followed for the duration of vaccination therapy, an expected average of more than 1 year.|Safety and tolerability: Number of Adverse Events with information of disease, grade and incidence, Participants will be followed for the duration of vaccination therapy, an expected average of more than 1 year.|Identification of biomarkers for efficacy and safety that are mentioned above, Participants will be followed for the duration of vaccination therapy, an expected average of more than 1 year.
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of S-488410 for advanced non-small cell lung cancers who failed to standard therapy.

The investigators previously identified three novel HLA-A\*2402-restricted epitope peptides, which were derived from three cancer-testis antigens, as targets for cancer vaccination against lung cancer. In this phase II trial, we examine using a combination of these three peptides the safety, immunogenicity, and antitumor effect of vaccine treatment for HLA-A\*2402-positive advanced small cell lung cancer patients who failed to standard therapy.
