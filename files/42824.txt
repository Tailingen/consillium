Training Physicians to Differentiate the Paris Classification Using Artificial Colon Polyp Images
Training in endoscopy is essential for the early detection of precursors of colorectal cancer. Up to now, this training has been carried out with image collections of findings and in practice when working on patients. We want to use artificial intelligence (AI) to better train doctors to recognise these precursors. By using generative AI, we were able to create realistic images that comply with data protection regulations and whose content can be predefined. Parts of the image can also be regenerated so that it is possible to create different precancerous stages in the same place in the image.

In this study we want to train physicians using real images or artificial images in order to compare which version helps classify polyps better.
