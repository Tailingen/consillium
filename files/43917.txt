Phase I/II Trial: Engineered Donor Graft (Orca Q) for Pediatric Hematopoietic Cell Transplant (HCT)
This is a first in children prospective study of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant using a centrally manufactured engineered donor graft (Orca-Q). The study will assess safety and efficacy of Orca-Q in pediatric patients with hematologic malignancies.

BIOLOGICAL: Orca-Q
Primary graft failure, Evaluate primary graft failure through day +28, defined as being alive without recovery of neutrophils (achieving an absolute neutrophil count \>500/µL for 3 consecutive days) by day +28, 28 days|Secondary graft failure, Evaluate secondary graft failure through day +100, defined as neutrophil engraftment followed by subsequent decline in absolute neutrophil counts to \<500 µL, unresponsive to growth factor therapy and in the absence of alternative explanations such as recurrence of the underlying malignant disorder, infections, microangiopathy, medications causing bone marrow suppression or immune-mediated cytopenia., 100 days
Non-relapse mortality (12 months post-transplant), Evaluate non-relapse mortality, defined as death without evidence of disease recurrence, at 12 months post-transplant, 12 months|Non-relapse mortality (24 months post-transplant), Evaluate non-relapse mortality, defined as death without evidence of disease recurrence, at 24 months post-transplant., 24 months|Overall survival, Determine the overall survival at 24 months post-transplant, as defined as the time from the date of transplant to the date of death from any cause or, for surviving patients, to the date of last follow-up., 24 months|Relapse rate (12 months post-transplant), Determine the relapse rate, as defined as the incidence of disease relapse through 12 months post-transplant. Disease relapse is defined as any of the following: ≥ 5% blasts in the bone marrow or peripheral blood, reappearance of pre-transplant cytogenetic abnormality, new evidence or redevelopment of extramedullary disease. Institution of any therapy to treat relapsed disease, such as withdrawal of immunosuppression or donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), will be considered evidence of relapse regardless of whether any of these are met., 12 months|Relapse rate (24 months post-transplant), Determine the relapse rate, as defined as the incidence of disease relapse through 24 months post-transplant. Disease relapse is defined as any of the following: ≥ 5% blasts in the bone marrow or peripheral blood, reappearance of pre-transplant cytogenetic abnormality, new evidence or redevelopment of extramedullary disease. Institution of any therapy to treat relapsed disease, such as withdrawal of immunosuppression or donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), will be considered evidence of relapse regardless of whether any of these are met., 24 months|Rate of acute GVHD, Determine the rate of acute GVHD at 6 months post-transplant, 6 months|Rate of chronic GVHD, Determine the rate of chronic GVHD through 24 months post-transplant., 24 months|Serious infection rate, Determine the rate of serious infections by 12 months post-transplant. A serious infection is defined as any new viral, bacterial, fungal or parasitic infection Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5.0 grade 2 or higher., 12 months|Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, Describe treatment-emergent adverse events through 24 months post-transplant., 24 months|Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)-free, relapse-free survival, Evaluate the GVHD-free, relapse-free survival at 12 months post-transplant. GVHD-free, relapse-free survival is defined as freedom from grade III or IV acute GVHD, moderate or severe chronic GVHD, or disease progression or relapse., 12 months
