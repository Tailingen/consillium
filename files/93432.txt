Biomarkers of Airway Disease, Barrett's and Underdiagnosed Reflux Noninvasively (BADBURN)
A majority of Fire Department of New York (FDNY) World Trade Center (WTC) exposed rescue and recovery workers developed gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a risk factor for Barrett's Esophagus (BE) and subsequent esophageal cancer. There is diminished health-related quality of life and productivity associated with aerodigestive diseases such as GERD and BE.

This proposal will leverage the longitudinally phenotyped WTC exposed cohort, validate biomarkers of WTC-aerodigestive disease, and develop novel, noninvasive disease phenotyping of premalignant diseases such as BE, and identify potential targeted therapeutics to improve care.

Levels of salivary pepsin, Saliva will be analyzed using the Peptest. The value of \>/= 16 ng/mL indicates a positive salivary pepsin., up to Day 365|pH Levels from Exhaled Breath Condensate (EBC), EBC pH assay will be performed, up to Day 365|Histamine Concentration from Exhaled Breath Condensate (EBC), Histamine concentration will be measured with an enzymatic immunoassay, up to Day 365|Score on Patient Assessment of Upper Gastrointestinal Disorders-Quality of Life (PAGI-QOL) Questionnaire, PAGI-QOL asks about how some of the gastrointestinal problems one may be experiencing (such as pain, discomfort, or other problems) may have affected one's overall quality of life and well-being in the past 2 weeks. PAGI-QOL consists of 30 questions, each scored from 0 (none of the time) to 5 (all of the time). The total score range is 0-150; the higher the score, the less the quality of life and well-being., up to Day 365|Score on Patient Assessment of Upper Gastrointestinal Disorders-Symptoms (PAGI-SYM) Questionnaire, PAGI-SYM asks about the severity of symptoms one may have related one's gastrointestinal problem. The questionnaire consists of 20 symptoms, and each symptom is scored from 0 (none) to 5 (very severe). The total score range is 0-100; the higher the score, the more severe the symptoms., up to Day 365|Score on St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ-C), SGRQ-C is designed to assess how one's breathing is troubling a participant and how it affects one's life. The questionnaire consists of 14 questions. The total score range is 0-54; the higher the score, the worse the chest trouble., up to Day 365|36-Item Short Form Survey Instrument (SF-36), SF-36 captures mental health, general health perception, emotional, and social role functioning. The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability., up to Day 365
