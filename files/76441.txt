A Phase 1 First-In-Human Study of the Anti-CD73 IPH5301 Alone or in Combination With Chemotherapy and Trastuzumab in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
CHANCES-IPC 2021-008 is First In Human, Phase I, multicenter, European study evaluating an anti-CD73, IPH5301 in advanced and/or metastatic cancer.

The trial will be conducted in two parts, Part I- Dose escalation: This part aims to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of IPH5301 agent in monotherapy and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for future trials, followed by a safety expansion study part cohort.

Part II- Expansion cohort: A total of 12 HER2+ cancer patients, respectively 6 breast cancer patients and 6 gastric cancer patients, is planned to be enrolled into the next expansion cohort to select a recommended dose of IPH5301 to be administered in combination with chemotherapy and trastuzumab for evaluation in future trials with selected advanced solid tumors.

Occurrence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of IPH5301 in monotherapy in the dose escalation and in combination with paclitaxel and trastuzumab in the expansion cohort, DLTs would include any grade 3 toxicity or higher that occurs during the first 4 weeks from the first injection of IPH5301, with the some exceptions, 1 month
