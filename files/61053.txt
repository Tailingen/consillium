Outcomes of FoundationOne Directed Therapy in Cancer of Unknown Primary
The goal of the current study is to determine whether Foundation Medicine's next generation sequencing assay, called FoundationOne, will provide information that allows physicians to make treatment decisions using targeted therapies in clinical trials or FDA approved therapies, including "off-label" agents, that result in superior OS compared to historical outcomes for standard CUP therapy.
