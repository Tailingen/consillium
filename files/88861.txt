The Role of Pelvic Peritonization in Laparoscopic or Robotic Low Anterior Resection
A randomized controlled clinical trial to compare the short and long outcomes of low anterior resection for middle-low rectal cancer with or without pelvic peritonization.
Rectum Cancer
PROCEDURE: Closure of the pelvic peritoneum|PROCEDURE: Nonclosure of the pelvic peritoneum
Grade III-IV complications, The rate of grade III-IV complication according to Clavien-Dindo classification after low anterior resection, 30 days
Rate of reoperation, The rate of reoperation after leakage, 30 days|Detection of inflammation markers, C-reactive protein(1, 3, 5, 7 days after operation, and 1 day before discharge, all blood drawn is venous blood), 7 days|The rate of anastomotic leakage, Clinical diagnostic criteria for anastomotic leakage: 1. Abdominal and systemic infection symptoms: abdominal pain, bloating, fever, elevated white blood cells, PCT, CRP and other inflammation indicators; 2. Gas, pus, feces passing through the pelvic drainage tube, abdominal incision, etc., 30 days|Hospital time, Comparison of hospital stay between the two groups, 30 days|Overall complication rate, Overall complication rate include I-IV grade, 30days|Estimated blood loss, Blood loss will be measured according to the suction and the weight of wet gauze, and then minus the irrigation, 1 day|Operation time, The time from start to end of surgery, 1 day|Postoperative bleeding, Postoperative intra-abdominal bleeding, 7 days|Intestinal obstruction, Incidence of intestinal obstruction caused by various reasons after surgery, 30 days|Readmission rate, Rate of hospital readmissions due to complications after discharge, 30 days|LARS, Low Anterior resection syndrome caused by rectal surgery, 12 months|Acute inflammatory Response, Procalcitonin(1, 3, 5, 7 days after operation, and 1 day before discharge, all blood drawn is venous blood), 7 days|Acute inflammatory Response, Check Neutrophils(1, 3, 5, 7 days after operation, and 1 day before discharge, all blood drawn is venous blood), 7 days|Detection of other inflammation markers, interleukin-6(1, 3, 5, 7 days after operation, and 1 day before discharge, all blood drawn is venous blood), 7 days|Treatment cost, Comparison of cost between the two groups, 30 days
