WALNUTS for POWER: Polyphenols, Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Weight Loss, and EneRgy
This is a randomized control trial testing the effect of walnut supplementation on prostate cancer progression in 50 men with biopsy confirmed prostate cancer and planning to undergo RP. Patients consented to the study will be randomly assigned to either continue their usual diets (control arm) or to the walnut arm for 4-10 weeks depending on the window between their consent date and the date for RP.

OTHER: walnuts|OTHER: usual diet|OTHER: phone counseling with dietitian
Mean difference in prostatic tissue Ki67 expression from baseline biopsy to RP, 10 weeks
Mean difference in prostatic tissue oxidative stress from baseline biopsy to RP, Measured by prostate tissue 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine, 10 weeks|Mean difference in prostatic tissue inflammation from baseline biopsy to RP, Measured by 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine and immune cell infiltration, 10 weeks
The overall objective of this study is to test the effect of walnuts added to a usual diet on prostate cancer progression as measured by Ki67 expression in the prostate tissues. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to usual diet or usual diet with the addition of 2 ounces of walnuts daily. The baseline visit will occur in conjunction with a standard of care visit post-biopsy, the intervention period will range from 4-10 weeks dependent upon the scheduled date of the standard of care radical prostatectomy (RP), and the final visit will occur in conjunction with a standard of care visit prior to RP.
