A Feasibility Study in Chronically Fatigued Cancer Survivors
Improved cancer survival has led to increased attention on long-term health and quality of life (QoL) among the survivors. Both the cancer diagnosis and intensive treatments increase the risk of late effects which may interfere with daily physical, psychological and social functioning, and thereby negatively affect their QoL. Well-documented late-effects among cancer survivors are second cancer, cardio-vascular disease, pain, hormone disturbances, mental distress and chronic fatigue (CF).

CF is a subjective experience of substantial lack of energy, exhaustion and cognitive difficulties lasting for six months or longer. CF is one of the most common and distressing late effects after cancer, affecting 15-35 % of survivors, often for years beyond treatment. Despite the high prevalence and the huge negative consequences of CF on daily functioning and QoL and the economic and societal costs, effective treatment of CF and standardized follow-up care are currently lacking.

CF is a complex condition best understood as a multifactorial phenomenon. Our and other research groups have examined various cohorts of cancer survivors in order to identify behavioral-, psychological-, and biological factors associated with CF, that can form the basis for targeted interventions. So far, few treatable biological factors have been identified, even though immune activation, flattened diurnal cortisol slopes and a blunted cortisol response to stress have been demonstrated in small studies among cancer survivors suffering from CF. On the other hand, several modifiable behavioral factors including emotional distress, physical inactivity, sleep disturbances and unhealthy diets are found to be associated with CF. So far, most of the interventions aiming to reduce fatigue during and shortly after cancer treatment have targeted only one of these factors at a time, with small to moderate effect sizes. No prior study has examined if CF in cancer survivors is better treated by a complex intervention targeting combinations of these factors, an approach which seems logical due to the complexity of the symptom.

The Division of Cancer Medicine at Oslo University Hospital (OUH) presently offers limited rehabilitation programs, including patient education, physical exercise, cognitive behavioral program and nutrition counselling to cancer survivors with CF. However, these programs are not offered as an interdisciplinary intervention integrated in a standardized patient care pathway, and the effects of these interventions have not been assessed. Based on the investigators clinical experience and published studies on single-targeted interventions, the investigators hypothesize that a complex intervention including psycho-educational elements, physical exercise and nutrition counseling delivered as a standardized patient care pathway is well-founded and doable, and will improve fatigue, functioning and QoL in cancer survivors with CF.

During the fall of 2021, the investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with the overall objective to improve fatigue in lymphoma survivors with CF. To uncover strengths and weaknesses with the planned RCT, i.e. the inclusion procedures, the assessments and the complex intervention, the investigators are now conducting a small one-armed feasibility study before the RCT during spring 2021.
