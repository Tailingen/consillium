Phase I Study of CPI-300 in Patients With Advanced Tumors
This is a prospective, open-label, single arm, non-randomized study of CPI-300 in patients with advanced tumors. CPI-300 is administered via intravenous infusion using an accelerated titration method followed by a conventional 3 + 3 study design to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).
Advanced Tumors
DRUG: CPI-300
Adverse Events, To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), which is defined as the highest dose level at which number of patients reporting a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is less than or equal to 33%, 28 days
Clinical Benefit, To assess clinical benefit by response rate and resolution of symptoms, which will be reported as response rate (%), 28 Days and additional CPI-300 treatments till disease progression or intolerability|Adverse Effect, To assess adverse effect as either treatment-related or non-treatment-related as defined by CTCAE, 28 Days and additional CPI-300 treatment till disease progression or intolerability|Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax), To evaluate maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of CPI-300 in patients tested, 8 Days|Area Under the Curve (AUC), To evaluate area under the curve (AUC) of CPI-300 in patients tested, 8 Days
Up to 6 dose levels of CPI-300 will be tested. MTD will be defined as the dose associated with a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in less than or equal to 33% of patients at the dose level tested. Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as one of the following events occurring from the intravenous injection of CPI-300 within 28 days:

* Grade 4 or greater treatment related adverse events
* Any Grade 3 or greater treatment related non-hematologic, non-dermatologic toxicity (including nausea, vomiting or diarrhea lasting more than 72 hours)

Blood samples will be drawn to determine drug blood concentrations for pharmacokinetic assessment.
