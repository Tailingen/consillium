A Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of FORE8394 in Participants With Cancer Harboring BRAF Alterations
The objective of this Master Protocol is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of plixorafenib in participants with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors, or recurrent or progressive primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors harboring BRAF fusions, or in participants with rare BRAF V600-mutated solid tumors, melanoma, thyroid, or recurrent primary CNS tumors.

DRUG: Plixorafenib|DRUG: Cobicistat
Objective Response Rate (ORR) (Subprotocols A, B and C), ORR will be determined by standard tumor response criteria by blinded independent central review (BICR)., Up to approximately 4 years|Pharmacokinetics (Subprotocol D), Systemic exposure of plixorafenib measured by Cmax and AUC, Up to approximately 4 years
Duration of Response (DOR) by BICR (Subprotocols A, B and C), DOR will be determined by standard tumor response criteria per BICR (subprotocols A-C), Up to approximately 4 years|ORR per Investigator Assessment, ORR will be determined by standard tumor response criteria by Investigator Assessment., Up to approximately 4 years|DOR per Investigator Assessment, DOR will be determined by standard tumor response criteria., Up to approximately 4 years|Percentage of Participants with DOR at 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months, 6 months, 12 months and 18 months|Time to Response by BICR (Subprotocols A, B and C), Up to approximately 4 years|Progression Free Survival (PFS) by BICR (Subprotocols A, B and C), Up to approximately 4 years|PFS per Investigator's Assessment, Up to approximately 4 years|Overall Survival, Up to approximately 4 years|Percentage of Participants with PFS at 6 months, 12 months and 24 months, BICR (Subprotocols A, B and C) Investigator Assessment (Subprotocols A, B, C and D), 6 months, 12 months and 24 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Up to approximately 4 years|Number of Participants who Experience Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Up to approximately 4 years|Plasma Concentrations of Plixorafenib, Up to approximately 4 years|Plasma Concentrations of Plixorafenib Metabolites, Up to approximately 4 years|Subprotocol A: CNS-DOR by BICR, Up to approximately 4 years|Subprotocol A: CNS-ORR by BICR, Up to approximately 4 years|Subgroup analyses for efficacy endpoints in low-grade and high-grade primary CNS tumors will be reported., Up to approximately 4 years
