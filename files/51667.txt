A Study of LOXO-260 in Cancer Patients With a Change in a Particular Gene (RET) That Has Not Responded to Treatment
The main purpose of this study is to learn more about the safety, side effects, and effectiveness of LOXO-260. LOXO-260 may be used to treat cancer that has a change in a particular gene (known as the RET gene). Participation could last up to 24 months (2 years) and possibly longer if the disease does not get worse.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung|Thyroid Neoplasms
DRUG: LOXO-260
Phase 1 a: To determine the MTD/RP2D of LOXO-260: Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) rate, DLT rate, During the first 28-day cycle of LOXO-260 treatment
Phase 1b: To assess the antitumor activity: Overall response rate (ORR), ORR per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version (RECIST) 1.1, Up to approximately 24 months or 2 years|To characterize the PK properties of LOXO-260: Mean concentration of LOXO-260, PK: Mean concentration of LOXO-260, Up to approximately 24 months or 2 years|To assess the antitumor activity of LOXO-260: ORR, ORR per RECIST 1.1, Up to approximately 24 months or 2 years
