HCV Related Hepatocellular Carcinoma Recurrence After Directly Acting Antivirals: A Randomized Controlled Trial
Data regarding hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence after directly acting antivirals (DAAs) given for hepatitis C virus treatment are contradictory. Surprisingly, some studies reported that DAAs are accompanied with higher HCC recurrence. But, other studies showed no rise or even decrease in HCC recurrence. Most of these studies were retrospective and some were non-randomized prospective studies. Here investigators aim to perform a randomized controlled trial to study this issue.
