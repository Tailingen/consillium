Safety and Efficacy of Nitrogen Mustard in Treatment of Mycosis Fungoides
This study will evaluate the efficacy, tolerability and safety of the topical application of mechlorethamine (MCH) formulations in patients with stage I or IIA mycosis fungoides (MF).
Mycosis Fungoides
DRUG: mechlorethamine-MCH (nitrogen mustard)
Ratio of Response Rates Based on CAILS, The ratio of the response rate of the patients treated with the PG formulation to the response rate of the patients treated with the AP formulation. Skin response determined by at least a 50% reduction from baseline in the Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Severity (CAILS) following up to 12 months of treatment, Assessment made at Day 1 and every subsequent visit during treatment
Severity-weighted Assessment Tool (SWAT) Within up to 12 Months by 2 or More Consecutive Observations Over at Least 4 Weeks, Assessment made at Day 1 and every subsequent visit during treatment|Percent of Participants Achieving at Least 50% Improvement of Severity Weighted Assessment Tool (SWAT), Assessment of lesion distribution and severity. A responder analysis was performed on whether subject achieved at least 50% improvement on scale. This had to be confirmed on at least one visit at least 4 weeks apart., Baseline to end of therapy
The successful use of mechlorethamine (MCH) as a topical agent in the treatment of mycosis fungoides, a form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, was first reported in the late 1950s, and provided a rationale for skin-directed chemotherapy that minimized systemic toxicity. Since then, multiple investigators have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of topically applied MCH in the treatment of mycosis fungoides. This study will evaluate the efficacy (non-inferiority), tolerability and safety of topical application of MCH proprietary gel versus a compounded ointment formulation in Aquaphor in patients with stage I or IIA MF.
