Clinical Trial to Compare Apatinib Plus Irinotecan Versus Single Irinotecan as Second-line Treatment in AGC or EGJA
The purpose of this study is to determine whether apatinib plus irinotecan can improve progression free survival compared with single irinotecan in patients with advanced gastric cancer or adenocarcinoma of esophagogastric junction who failed one lines of chemotherapy.
Advanced Gastric Cancer Adenocarcinoma of Esophagogastric Junction
DRUG: Apatinib|DRUG: Irinotecan
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), 18 months|Adverse Event（AE）, NCI CTC 4.03, 18 months
Objective Response Rate (ORR), 18 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), 18 months|Overall Survival(OS), 18 months|Quality of Life (QoL), Use the validated European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 \[EORTC QLQ-C30\]., 18 months
Gastric cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in China. Most patients are unresectable or metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis,so the prognosis is poor.Systemic therapy was required for the patients with advanced stage. Platinum combined with fluoropyrimidines always were considered as first line treatment. After failure of initial therapy, single agent of irinotecan was used as second line treatment,but limited survival benefit.Apatinib, a novel targeted inhibitor of VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2).The purpose of this study is to determine whether apatinib plus irinotecan can improve progression free survival compared with single irinotecan in patients with advanced gastric cancer or adenocarcinoma of esophagogastric junction who failed one lines of chemotherapy.
