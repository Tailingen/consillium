A Study of Camrelizumab Plus Chemotherapy vs Placebo Plus Chemotherapy as Neoadjuvant Therapy in Participants With Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of camrelizumab (an engineered anti-programmed death-ligand 1 \[PD-1\] antibody) plus chemotherapy vs placebo plus chemotherapy as neoadjuvant therapy in participants with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to Arm A (camrelizumab +chemotherapy) or Arm B (placebo + chemotherapy).
Triple Negative Breast Cancer
DRUG: Camrelizumab Plus Chemotherapy|DRUG: placebo+chemotherapy
