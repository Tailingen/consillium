Improvements in Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MR Angiography and Perfusion and Non-Contrast MRI
This study evaluates if technical improvements in MRI can be used to provide improved performance contrast-enhanced MRI as used for angiography and perfusion as well as in non-contrast MRI.

OTHER: Non-Interventional Study
Improved performance in contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as used for angiography and perfusion, Assessed by comparison of two images made from the raw data set but reconstructed using the standard vs. an alternative algorithm (to be determined during study). Data will be tabulated and analyzed statistically., Baseline (at enrollment); possible second scan at a later date
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To study how a variety of technological approaches in MRI can be used to provide improved performance contrast-enhanced MR imaging as used for angiography and perfusion as well as in MR image acquisition without the use of contrast material.

OUTLINE: This is an observational study.

Participants undergo a non-contrast MRI on study and may optionally undergo a second non-contrast MRI on study. Participants may also undergo blood sample collection on study.
