A Study of Zanidatamab (ZW25) With Evorpacept (ALX148) in Patients With Advanced HER2-expressing Cancer
This study is being done to find out if zanidatamab when given with evorpacept (ALX148) is safe and can treat patients with advanced (locally advanced \[inoperable\] and/or metastatic) human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-expressing cancer.
HER2-expressing Cancers
DRUG: Zanidatamab|DRUG: Evorpacept
Incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs; Part 1), Number of patients who experienced a DLT. DLTs include specifically defined adverse events (AEs) considered to be related to zanidatamab or evorpacept (ALX148), including combination of zanidatamab with evorpacept (ALX148), Up to 4 weeks|Incidence of AEs (Part 1), Number of patients who experienced AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), or adverse events of special interest (AESIs), Up to 7 months|Incidence of clinical laboratory abnormalities (Part 1), Number of patients who experienced a Grade 3 or higher post-baseline laboratory abnormality, including either hematology or chemistry. Grades are defined using National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE), version 5.0, Up to 7 months|Confirmed objective response rate (ORR)(Part 2), Number of patients who achieved a confirmed best overall response (BOR) of either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) during treatment per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, Up to 2 years
Disease control rate (DCR)(Part 2), Number of patients who achieved a best response of CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) during treatment per RECIST 1.1, Up to 2 years|Clinical benefit rate (CBR)(Part 2), Number of patients who achieved a SD for ≥ 24 weeks or a confirmed BOR of CR or PR during treatment per RECIST 1.1, Up to 2 years|Duration of response (DOR)(Part 2), The time from the first objective response (CR or PR) to documented progressive disease per RECIST 1.1, clinical progression, or death within 30 days of last dose of study drug (zanidatamab and/or evorpacept \[ALX148\]) from any cause, Up to 2 years|Progression-free survival (PFS)(Part 2), The time from the first dose of study treatment to the date of documented disease progression (per RECIST 1.1), clinical progression, or death from any cause, Up to 2 years|Progression-free survival 6 (PFS6)(Part 2), Number of patients with a PFS time ≥ 24 weeks, Up to 6 months|Overall survival (OS)(Part 2), The time from first dose of study treatment until death from any cause, Up to 2 years|Incidence of AEs (Part 2), Number of patients who experienced AEs, SAEs, or AESIs, Up to 7 months|Incidence of clinical laboratory abnormalities (Part 2), Number of patients who experienced a maximum severity of Grade 3 or higher post-baseline laboratory abnormality, including either hematology or chemistry. Grades are defined using NCI-CTCAE, version 5.0, Up to 7 months|Maximum serum concentration of zanidatamab and evorpacept (ALX148) (Part 2), Up to 7 months|Trough concentration of zanidatamab and evorpacept (ALX148) (Part 2), Minimum observed serum concentration (trough), Up to 7 months|Incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs)(Part 2), Number of patients who develop ADAs, Up to 7 months
Part 1 of the study will first evaluate the safety and tolerability and establish the recommended doses (RDs) of zanidatamab in combination with evorpacept (ALX148). Part 2 of the study will evaluate the anti-tumor activity of the combination of zanidatamab plus evorpacept (ALX148) at the RD levels in indication-specific expansion cohorts.
