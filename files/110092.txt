Clinical Study of Endocardial Myocardial Biopsy
In this study, patients with endocardial myocardial biopsy were selected to observe the safety of the operation, and pathological examination was performed. If necessary, special tests such as viral examination, mass spectrometry and molecular biology were performed to confirm the diagnosis, and follow-up was performed.
