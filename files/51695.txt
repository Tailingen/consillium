Theca Cell Function in Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)
The mechanism for increased androgen production in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is not well understood. Excess androgen production by the ovary is stimulated by increased pituitary luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion in this disorder. The investigators hypothesize that in PCOS women ovarian theca cells, which are responsible for androgen synthesis, are more sensitive to LH stimulation compared to that of theca cells from normal women. To test this hypothesis, the investigators propose to conduct a dose-response study in which androgen responses to multiple doses of human chorionic gonadotgropin (hCG), an LH surrogate, will be assessed in PCOS and normal women.
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
DRUG: recombinant human chorionic gonadotropin
Serum 17OHP Responses to hCG, Assess serum 17OHP levels following each dose of hCG adminstration in PCOS and normal subjects, 24 hrs post dose
Serum Testosterone Responses to hCG, Mean serum testosterone levels before and after hCG injection. Serum testosterone levels before (-0.5 and 0 hrs) were averaged to achieve a single value, -0.5, 0, 24 hrs
Each subject (normal and PCOS women) will be admitted to the UCSD General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) for study on 5 occasions. All subjects will receive an intravenous injection of hCG dose of 1, 10, 25, 100, and 250 micrograms, each of which will be given on one of 5 different days each separated by at least two weeks at 8 AM. Blood samples will be obtained at t -0.5, 0, and 24 hours after injection. All visits to the GCRC will be done as out patients. The total amount of blood withdrawn will be about 35 teaspoons. For normal control subjects this will be over a period of about 4-6 months and for PCOS subjects this will be over a period of about 6-10 weeks.
