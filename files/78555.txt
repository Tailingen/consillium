A Trial to Determine the Safety and Anti-tumor Activity Profile of the Combination of Cetuximab and Concomitant Cisplatin Plus 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) in Subjects With Recurrent and/or Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma in Head and Neck
The primary objective of this trial is to assess the antitumor activity and safety profile of cetuximab when given in combination with cisplatin + 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) for the first-line treatment of recurrent and/or metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma in Head and Neck (SCCHN) in Asian subjects.
Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck
BIOLOGICAL: Cetuximab|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: 5-Fluorouracil
Best Overall Response (BOR) Until Cut-off Date 25 January 2011, BOR: Percentage of participants experiencing a Complete Response (CR) (complete disappearance of measurable and evaluable disease without new lesions) or Partial Response (PR) (greater than or equal to 50 percent decrease of sum of product diameters of measurable disease, evaluable disease not worsening or progressing, no new lesions confirmed by a subsequent assessment no less than 28 days after criteria for response were first met) (based on modified World Health Organization \[WHO\] criteria), divided by the number of participants belonging to intention to treat (ITT) or safety population., Evaluations were performed every 6 weeks until progression, reported between day of first participant randomized, 25 December 2009, until cut-off date 25 January 2011|Best Overall Response (BOR) Until Cut-off Date 15 November 2012, BOR: Percentage of participants experiencing a CR (complete disappearance of measurable and evaluable disease without new lesions) or PR (greater than or equal to 50 percent decrease of sum of product diameters of measurable disease, evaluable disease not worsening or progressing, no new lesions confirmed by a subsequent assessment no less than 28 days after criteria for response were first met) (based on modified WHO criteria), divided by the number of participants belonging to ITT or safety population., Evaluations were performed every 6 weeks until progression, reported between day of first participant randomized, 25 December 2009, until cut-off date 15 November 2012
Overall Survival (OS) Time Until Cut-off Date 15 November 2012, The OS time was defined as the time from first administration of trial treatment to death. Participants without event are censored at the last date known to be alive or at the clinical cut-off date, whatever is earlier., Time from randomization to death or last day known to be alive, reported between day of first participant randomized, 25 December 2009, until cut-off date 15 November 2012|Progression-free Survival (PFS) Time Until Cut-off Date 25 January 2011, Duration from first administration of trial treatment until progression (radiological or clinical, if radiological progression is not available) or death due to any cause. Only deaths within 60 days of last tumor assessment are considered. Participants without event are censored on the date of last tumor assessment., Evaluations were performed every 6 weeks until progression, reported between day of first participant randomized, 25 December 2009, until cut-off date 25 January 2011|Progression-free Survival (PFS) Time Until Cut-off Date 15 November 2012, Duration from first administration of trial treatment until progression (radiological or clinical, if radiological progression is not available) or death due to any cause. Only deaths within 60 days of last tumor assessment are considered. Participants without event are censored on the date of last tumor assessment., Evaluations were performed every 6 weeks until progression, reported between day of first participant randomized, 25 December 2009, until cut-off date 15 November 2012|Time to Progression (TTP) Until Cut-off Date 25 January 2011, Time from first administration of trial treatment to disease progression (radiological or clinical, if radiological progression is not available). Participants without event are censored on the date of last tumor assessment., Evaluations were performed every 6 weeks until progression, reported between day of first participant randomized, 25 December 2009, until cut-off date 25 January 2011|Time to Progression (TTP) Until Cut-off Date 15 November 2012, Time from first administration of trial treatment to disease progression (radiological or clinical, if radiological progression is not available). Participants without event are censored on the date of last tumor assessment., Evaluations were performed every 6 weeks until progression, reported between day of first participant randomized, 25 December 2009, until cut-off date 15 November 2012|Duration of Response Until Cut-off Date 25 January 2011, Time from first assessment of CR or PR to disease progression or death (within 60 days of last tumor assessment). Participants without event are censored on the date of last tumor assessment. Tumor assessments based on modified WHO criteria., Evaluations were performed every 6 weeks until progression, reported between day of first participant randomized, 25 December 2009, until cut-off date 25 January 2011|Duration of Response Until Cut-off Date 15 November 2012, Time from first assessment of CR or PR to disease progression or death (within 60 days of last tumor assessment). Participants without event are censored on the date of last tumor assessment.
