Fecal Microbiota Transplantation in Treating Immune-Checkpoint Inhibitor Induced-Diarrhea or Colitis in Genitourinary Cancer Patients
This trial studies how well fecal microbiota transplantation works in treating diarrhea or colitis (inflammation of the intestines) that is caused by certain types of medications (called immune-checkpoint inhibitors) in patients with genitourinary cancer. Fecal microbiota transplantation may effectively reduce the incidence of immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced diarrhea/colitis.

PROCEDURE: Fecal Microbiota Transplantation|DRUG: Loperamide
Incidence of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)-related adverse events, Assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5. All events are recorded with grade and attribution to FMT., Up to 3 months post-FMT|Clinical response/remission of immune-related diarrhea/colitis, Clinical remission of immune related events defined as improvement of symptoms of grade 1 or lower within 2 weeks post-FMT. Clinical partial response of immune related diarrhea/colitis defined as improvement of diarrhea/colitis to a lower grade than the initial presentation but not meeting criteria of clinical remission at 2 week post-FMT time point., At 2 weeks post-FMT
Recurrent immune-related diarrhea/colitis within 3 months post-FMT after initially achieving clinical remission/response, Recurrent immune-related diarrhea colitis events occurring post-FMT are recorded throughout the follow-up period., Up to 3 months post-FMT
Endoscopic remission (Mayo Clinic sub-score 0-1) of immune-related diarrhea/colitis, Endoscopic remission is defined as Mayo Clinic endoscopic subscore 0 or 1 (absence of ulcers, with or without mild erythema, friability and decreased vascular pattern)., At 4 weeks and 8 weeks post-FMT|Histological remission (resolution of active inflammation) of immune-related diarrhea/colitis, Histological remission is defined resolution of active inflammation on biopsy sample., At 8 weeks post-FMT|Recurrent immune-related diarrhea/colitis following FMT and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICPI) resumption within 6 months of ICPI resumption, Recurrent immune-related diarrhea colitis events occurring post-FMT will be recorded throughout the follow-up period., Up to 6 months after restarting ICPI|Measure immunological measures (including levels of cytokines (IL-6, 17, TNF, etc.) in tissue/blood/stool samples, Blood, stool, and colon tissues will be collected from at each scheduled time point. Markers of interest for immunological and biological profiles include levels of cytokines (IL-6, 17, TNF, etc). Special attention will focus on Bacteroidetes, Akkermansia, and Blautia., Up to 3 months|Frequencies of immune cells (CD4/8 T cells, regulatory T cells [Treg], macrophages, etc.) in tissue/blood/stool samples, Blood, stool, and colon tissues will be collected from at each scheduled time point. Markers of interest for immunological and biological profiles include frequencies of immune cells (CD4/8 T cells, Treg, macrophages, etc). Special attention will focus on Bacteroidetes, Akkermansia, and Blautia., Up to 3 months
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

* To assess the safety and tolerability of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT).
* To assess the efficacy of FMT for clinical remission/response of immune-related diarrhea/colitis.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

- To measure the recurrence rate after achieving clinical remission/response of immune-related diarrhea/colitis.

EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

* To assess the efficacy of FMT to achieve endoscopic remission of immune-related diarrhea/colitis.
* To assess the efficacy of FMT to achieve histological remission of immune-related diarrhea/colitis.
* To assess the efficacy of FMT on recurrence of immune-related diarrhea/colitis after resumption of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICPI).
* To assess immunological, molecular and microbiome changes in tissue/blood/stool.

To study the efficacy and/ or benefit of PuraStat gel in the healing of mucosal ulcers and its hemostatic effect on bleeding lesions

OUTLINE:

Patients receive loperamide orally (PO). After 4 hours, patients undergo FMT via colonoscopy over 15-30 minutes.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2, 4, and 8 weeks, and then at 3 months.
