Protein-rich Nutritional Therapy Combined With Time-efficient Exercise in Cancer Therapy
This study aims to evaluate the effects of a 12-week protein-rich individualized nutritional therapy combined with different time-efficient exercise programs on overall physical fitness (cardiorespiratory fitness and muscular fitness), inflammation, and muscle mass/body composition in patients with malignant disease undergoing curative or palliative anti-cancer treatment

OTHER: Resistance Training|OTHER: WB-EMS|OTHER: High-intensity interval training (HIIT)|OTHER: Combined HIIT and Resistance Training (Combi)
Overall physical fitness, Cardiorespiratory Fitness and Muscular Fitness (Overall Fitness Score is calculated from Maximum Oxygen uptake, VO2max, and Muscle strength (estimated from the 1-repetition Maximum - the maximum amount of weight \[kg\] that can be lifted for one repetition) of the five major muscle groups (chest, upper back, lower back, abdominals, legs), 12 weeks
Muscle mass, Muscle mass (kg) is assessed by bioelectrical impedance Analysis (BIA), 12 weeks|Fat mass, Fat mass (kg) is assessed by bioelectrical impedance Analysis (BIA), 12 weeks|Total Body Water, Total Body Water (L) is assessed by bioelectrical impedance Analysis (BIA), 12 weeks|Patient-reported performance status-1, Patient-reported performance Status will be assessed using the ECOG Performance Status questionnaire. It describes a patient's level of functioning in terms of their ability to care for themself, daily activity, and physical ability. The score ranges from 0-5 (lower values = better outcome)., 12 weeks|Patient-reported performance status-2, Patient-reported performance status-2 will be assessed using the Karnofsky index. It is used methods to assess the functional status of a Patient. The score ranges from 0-100 (higher value = better outcome)., 12 weeks|Patient-reported Quality of Life (QoL), Patient-reported QoL will be assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. It contains 30 questions (items), representing various aspects/dimensions of QoL (physical, role, emotional, cognitive and social), and 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain and nausea).The scales of the different dimensions of QoL (higher values = better outcome) and symptoms (lower values = better outcomes) range from 0-100., 12 weeks|Patient-reported Fatigue, Fatigue will be assessed using the FACIT-Fatigue scale. It contains 13 items (different aspects/dimensions of fatigue) each assessed on a scale of 0-4, with lower values indicating a better outcome)., 12 weeks|Patient-reported Physical Activity, Patient-reported Physical Activity (PA) will be assessed using the the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). IPAQ records 4 aspects of PA (job-, transportation-, housework-, and leisure-time-related). There are two forms of output from scoring the IPAQ. Results can be reported in categories (low, moderate or high PA levels) or as a continuous variable (MET minutes a week, 1 MET = resting energy expenditure). MET minutes represent the amount of energy expended carrying out physical activity. High PA = at least 1500 MET minutes/week; moderate PA: at least 600 MET minutes/week; low PA: \< 600 MET minutes/week. Higher values represent a better outcome., 12 weeks|Objective Physical Activity, Objective measurement of physical activity will be preformed using Pedometers. Higher values represent a better outcome., 12 weeks|Inflammatory blood markers, Inflammation will be assessed by measuring blood levels (mg/L) of c-reactive protein (CRP) and high-sensitivity creactive protein (hs-CRP)., 12 weeks|Cardiometabolic Risk Profile (Metabolic Syndrome Z-Score, MetS), MetS will be calculated MetS-Z-Score will be calculated from each individual's measures of waist circumference (cm), mean arterial blood pressure (mmHg), blood levels of glucose (mg/dL), triglycerides (mg/dL), and HDL-cholesterol (mg/ dL), based on equations specific to sex., 12 weeks
