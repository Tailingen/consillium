STEpwise Research Program to Promote INGeniouS ONline Supportive Solutions in the Relief of Cancer-related Fatigue
Decentralized, randomized hybrid type 2 (effectiveness/implementation) controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of three different digital aid modalities programs in reducing the perceived burden of CRF in cancer patients while also gathering data on the implementation strategy.

Compare the effectiveness of standard of care plus three different types of digital aid modalities for the patient., Compare the effectiveness of standard of care (provided by the patient's cancer center and their treating oncologist) plus three different types of digital aid modalities for the patient (1: educational material; 2: educational material plus self-management program based on a cognitive behavioural therapy strategy - self-administered; 3: educational material plus self-management program based on a cognitive behavioural therapy strategy - guided by a psychologist) in reducing the perceived burden of CRF (cancer-related fatigue), measured as a clinically meaningful change (â‰¥ 6 points) in fatigue scores in the fatigue subscale of the EORTC QLQ C30 questionnaire from baseline to short-term assessments., 3 months and 6 months after the end of the program.
