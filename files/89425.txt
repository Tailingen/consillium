Application of 3D Printing Technique in Small Pulmonary Nodule Localization
The trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of three-dimensional printed navigational template in the clinical application of small peripheral lung nodule localization.

DEVICE: template-guided localization|OTHER: CT-guided localization
Accuracy of Lung Nodule Localization, Localization accuracy was defined by the localizer deviation between the hookwire and the center of the target nodule. (The deviation was measured using CAD software after downloading the CT images from the Picture Archiving and Communication Systems.), From the time of completing final CT scan, assessed up to 2 days.
Procedural Duration of the Nodule Localization, Procedural duration was derived from CT scan parameters, which was calculated as the time length between the initial and final scan., From the time of completing final CT scan, assessed up to 1 hour.|Radiation Dose, Radiation dosage was read on the monitor screen of CT scanner and converted to effective dosage., From the time of completing final CT scan, assessed up to 1 hour.|Complication Rate, Pnuemothorax related to lung nodule localization, From the time of completing final CT scan, assessed up to 2 days.
Localization of small lung nodule is challenging due to the difficulty of nodule recognition during VATS. A three-dimensional printed navigational template was designed to aid percutaneous lung nodule localization, and its feasibility has been confirmed in previous study. The trial was conducted to confirm the non-inferiority of template-guided method to conventional CT-guided method in terms of localization accuracy.
