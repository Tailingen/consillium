A Study to Determine the Metabolism and Elimination of Carbon-14 Labeled Eribulin Acetate (14C-Eribulin) in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to determine the metabolism and elimination of carbon-14 labeled eribulin acetate (14C-eribulin) in patients with advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: eribulin
Excretion Balance of Radio-labeled 14C-eribulin: Total Recovery of Radioactive Dose in Urine and Feces., 312 hours postdose|Pharmacokinetics: AUC (0-t) for Total Radioactivity in Plasma, Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to last quantifiable plasma concentration measuring total radioactivity exposure., Between Days 1 and 8 of Cycle 1|Pharmacokinetics AUC (0-t) for Eribulin in Plasma, Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to last quantifiable plasma concentration measuring exposure to eribulin., Between Days 1 and 8 of Cycle 1
The study will be conducted in two phases, the initial Study phase to administer the radio-labeled 14C-eribulin and collection of PK samples, and the Extension Phase when the patients will continue to receive non-radio-labeled eribulin. In the initial Study phase, patients will receive a single 2 mg flat dose of 14C-eribulin (approximately 80 to 90 microCuries) administered on Cycle 1 Day 1 as an intravenous (IV) bolus injection or infusion over 2-5 minutes. Following this initial dose, patients will remain in the research unit until Day 8 to complete sample collections of urine, blood and feces for PK analysis and determination of 14C-eribulin concentrations between Days 1 and 8.

On Day 8 patients will be re-assessed and discharged, and return on day 15 for physical exam, adverse event evaluation, and lab tests. The patients will then enter the Extension Phase of the study and continue to receive on-radio-labeled eribulin at a dose of 1.4 mg/m\^2 on Days 1 and 8 of every 21 day cycle.
