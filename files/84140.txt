Phase III Study of Toripalimab（JS001） Combined With Lenvatinib for Advanced HCC
This is a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter phase III registration clinical study to observe, compare and evaluate the efficacy and safety of Toripalimab combined with Lenvatinib versus placebo combined with Lenvatinib as the 1st-line therapy for advanced HCC.

Eligible subjects will be randomized at a ratio of 2:1 to receive Toripalimab combined with Lenvatinib (experimental group) or Placebo combined with Lenvatinib (control group).
Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)
COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Toripalimab combined with Lenvatinib|COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Placebo combined with Lenvatinib
Overall survival (OS), The time from randomization to death for any reason., Up to 3 years
ORR, Defined as the proportion of subjects with the best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)., Up to 3 years|Duration of Response (DOR), Defined as the time from the first evaluation of CR or PR to the first evaluation of PD or death for any reason., Up to 3 years|DCR, Defined as the proportion of subjects with the best overall response (BOR) of CR, PR or SD., Up to 3 years|TTP, Defined as the time from randomization to objective tumor progression., Up to 3 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), The time from randomization to progression of disease or death for any reason, whichever comes first. Progression of disease will be evaluated, Up to 3 years|PFS rate, The PFS rate on 6 months and 1year in both groups., Up to 3 years|OS rate, The OS rate on 1year and 2years in both groups., Up to 3 years|Incidence,severity and prognosis of AEs/SAEs as assessed by NCI-CTCAE v5.0, Verbatim descriptions of adverse events will correspond to MedDRA synonymous terms, and AEs will be graded in accordance with NCI-CTCAE version 5.0. All the adverse events during or after the first dose of study drug will be summarized by treatment groups and NCI CTCAE grade. In addition, serious adverse events, adverse events (grade 3 or above) and the adverse events leading to discontinuation or suspension of study drug will be summarized correspondingly. Multiple occurrence of the same event will be counted once in accordance with the highest severity. The proportion of subjects with at least one adverse event will be reported by term of toxicity and treatment groups., From date of consent informed until 90 days after the last investigational product administration. Up to 2 approximately years.|PK, According to the test of blood samples, the pharmacokinetic parameters of Toripalimab, mainly trough concentration, will be analyzed., To be collected once within 60 minutes prior to administration each for Toripalimab/placebo on Day 1 of Cycle (each cycle is 21 days). but the no-china sites not collection the sample|Immunogenicity, Plasma level of anti-Toripalimab injection (JS001) antibody, immunoglobulin and Toripalimab injection (JS001) will be summarized descriptively., Up to 3 years
Assessment of the correlation between tumor cell PD-L1 expression level/ percentage and efficacy, Tumor biopsy specimen collected before the treatment and tumor specimen collected at progression of tumor will be used for immunohistochemical staining test to determine the expression of PD-L1, Up to 3 years|Tumor mutation burden (TMB), Correlation between TMB of tumor tissue and the efficacy, Up to 3 years
