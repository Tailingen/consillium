Crisugabalin for Radiotherapy-Related Neuropathic Pain
The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether Crisugabalin has similar efficacy compared to Pregabalin in reducing radiotherapy-related neuropathic pain (RRNP) in patients with head and neck cancers.
Neuropathic Pain
DRUG: Crisugabalin|DRUG: Pregabalin
Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) Change, The change in NRS score from baseline to Week 4 of treatment. The NRS measures pain intensity on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 indicates no pain and 10 indicates the worst imaginable pain., 4 weeks
Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) Change, The change in NRS score from baseline to Week 1 of treatment. The NRS measures pain intensity on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 indicates no pain and 10 indicates the worst imaginable pain., 1 week|Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Change, The VAS measures pain intensity on a 0-100 mm scale, with 0 representing no pain and 100 representing the worst imaginable pain., 4 weeks|Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) and Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) scores, The HAMA and HAMD are used to evaluate anxiety and depressive symptoms, respectively., 4 weeks|Daily Sleep Interference Scale (DSIS), The DSIS measures the impact of pain on sleep quality. Scores range from 0 (no interference) to 10 (complete interference)., 4 weeks|Health Status According to EuroQol-5-Domain-5-Level health questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L), The EQ-5D-5L assessed quality of life based on 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The participant was asked to 'check the ONE box that best describes your health TODAY,' choosing from 5 options (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, extreme problems) provided under each dimension.

The health state index value is a single value on a scale from 0 to 100 scores indicating better health: 0 = indicating worst health and 100 = best imaginable health., 4 weeks|Response Rates, The proportion of patients achieving ≥30% and ≥50% reductions in NRS score from baseline to Week 4., 4 weeks|Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ), Participants rate their pain in three parts of the questionnaire, which are combined into a single pain intensity score:

Part 1 - fifteen descriptors of pain intensity, on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe); Part 2 - the VAS, in which the participant rates pain on a 100 mm-long horizontal line, where 0 mm = no pain and 100 mm = worst possible pain; Part 3 - a present pain intensity index in which the participant rates present pain intensity on a scale of 0 (no pain) to 5 (most intense pain)., 4 weeks|Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), PGIC is a 7 point scale depicting a patient's rating of overall improvement, with 1 representing very much improved and 7 representing very much worse., 4 weeks
The primary objective of this study is to determine whether Crisugabalin provides non-inferior pain relief compared to Pregabalin in patients with head and neck cancer experiencing radiotherapy-related neuropathic pain. The trial adopts a multicenter, randomized, open-label design, and the primary endpoint is the change in Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) pain scores from baseline to 4 weeks. The study aims to provide new evidence to support treatment strategies for this condition, which significantly affects patients' quality of life.
