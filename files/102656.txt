Immune-checkpoint Inhibitors and Surrogate Endpoints in Cancer Trials (SURROGATE-ICI)
The objective of this research work is two-fold: (i) to conduct a systematic literature review to identify surrogate endpoints in this specific drug class (review registered in the PROSPERO database) and (ii) to assess the surrogate properties of candidate surrogate endpoints in the specific context of melanoma cancer.
