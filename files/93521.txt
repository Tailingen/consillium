3D Versus 2D Laparoscopic Total Gastrectomy With Splenic Hilum Lymph Nodes Dissection
The investigators will perform a prospective randomized comparison between 3D and 2D laparoscopic total gastrectomy with splenic hilum lymph nodes dissection.
Splenic Hilum Lymph Nodes Dissection
PROCEDURE: 3D Laparoscopic total gastrectomy|PROCEDURE: 2D Laparoscopic total gastrectomy
Number of splenic hilum lymph nodes harvested, 7 days
Early complication rate, The early complication rate is defined as the event observed during operation and within 30 days after surgery., 30 days|Operative time, It will be assessed with the unit of "minute"., Intraoperative|Operative blood loss, It will be assessed with the unit of "ml"., Intraoperative|Time of splenic hilum lymph nodes dissection, It will be assessed with the unit of "minute", Intraoperative|Number of total lymph nodes harvested, 7 days|Poster-operative recovery course, Time to first ambulation (unit of hour), flatus (unit of hour), liquid diet (unit of hour) and duration of hospital stay (unit of day) are used to assess the postoperative recovery course., 30 days|Quality of life, It will be assessed with questionnaire of "WHO-QOL-100" (WHO was short for world health organization), 1 year|3-year disease free survival rate, 3 years|3-year overall survival rate, 3 years
A prospective randomized comparison of 3D and 2D laparoscopic surgery for advanced gastric cancer with spleen-preserving splenic hilum lymph nodes dissection will be performed, to evaluate the safety and feasibility for the extensive application of the novel 3D laparoscopic technique. The evaluation parameters are number of group No.10 lymph nodes harvested, perioperative clinical efficacy, postoperative life quality and 3-year survival and recurrence rates.
