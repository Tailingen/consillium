Phase 3 Study of Nivolumab or Nivolumab Plus Ipilimumab Versus Ipilimumab Alone in Previously Untreated Advanced Melanoma (CheckMate 067)
The purpose of this study is to show that Nivolumab and/or Nivolumab in combination with Ipilimumab will extend progression free survival and overall survival compared to Ipilimumab alone.
Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma
BIOLOGICAL: Nivolumab|BIOLOGICAL: Ipilimumab|BIOLOGICAL: Placebo for Nivolumab|BIOLOGICAL: Placebo for Ipilimumab
Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time between the date of randomization and the first date of documented progression, as determined by the Investigator, or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Participants who died without a reported progression were considered to have progressed on the date of their death. Participants who did not progress or die were censored on the date of their last evaluable tumor assessment. Participants who did not have any on study tumor assessments and did not die were censored on their date of randomization. Participants treated beyond progression were considered to have progressive disease at the time of the initial progression event regardless of subsequent tumor response. Particpants who started anti-cancer therapy without a prior reported progression were censored on the date of their last evaluable tumor assessment prior to the initiation of subsequent anti-cancer therapy., From randomization until disease progression or death, whichever occurred first (assessed up to February 2015, approximately 20 months)|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of death. For participants without documentation of death, OS was censored on the last date the participant was known to be alive., From randomization to date of death (Assessed up to September 2016, approximately 39 months)|Rate of Overall Survival, OS was defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of death. For participants without documentation of death, OS was censored on the last date the participant was known to be alive. The overall survival rate at time T (6, 12, or 24 months) was defined as the probability that a participant was alive at time T following randomization., 24 months|Rate of Progression-Free Survival, PFS was defined as the time between the date of randomization and the first date of documented progression, as determined by the Investigator, or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Participants who died without a reported progression were considered to have progressed on the date of their death. Participants who did not progress or die were censored on the date of their last evaluable tumor assessment. Participants who did not have any on study tumor assessments and did not die were censored on their date of randomization. Participants treated beyond progression were considered to have progressive disease at the time of the initial progression event regardless of subsequent tumor response. Participants who started anti-cancer therapy without a prior reported progression were censored on the date of their last evaluable tumor assessment prior to the initiation of subsequent anti-cancer therapy., 24 months

Participants treated beyond progression were considered to have progressive disease at the time of the initial progression event regardless of subsequent tumor response. Participants who started anti-cancer therapy without a prior reported progression were censored on the date of their last evaluable tumor assessment prior to the initiation of subsequent anti-cancer therapy., From randomization until disease progression or death, whichever occurred first (assessed up to approximately 128 months)|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of death. For participants without documentation of death, OS was censored on the last date the participant was known to be alive., From randomization until death (assessed up to approximately 128 months)|Objective Response Rate (ORR) Per Investigator Assessment, The ORR was defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response (BOR) of a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) divided by the number of randomized participants for each arm. The BOR was defined as the best response designation, as determined by the Investigator, recorded between the date of randomization and the date of progression, as assessed by the Investigator per RECIST 1.1 or the date of subsequent anticancer therapy (including tumor-directed radiotherapy and tumor-directed surgery), whichever occurred first. For participants without evidence of RECIST 1.1 progression or subsequent anticancer therapy, all available response designations contributed to the BOR assessment. CR= Disappearance of all evidence of disease, confirmed by PET scan; PR= Regression of measureable disease and no new sites; Stable Disease (SD)= Failure to attain CR/PR or PD; Progressive Disease (PD)= Any new lesion or increase by \>=50% of previously involved sites from nadir., From randomization until disease progression or death, whichever occurred first (assessed up to approximately 128 months)|Progression-Free Survival Based on PD-L1 Expression Level, PD-L1 expression was defined as the percent of tumor cells demonstrating plasma membrane PD-L1 staining of any intensity using an IHC assay. Tumor biopsy specimens without measurable PD-L1 expression were classified as indeterminate if the staining was hampered for reasons attributed to the biology of the specimen and not because of improper specimen preparation or handling. Missing specimens, specimens that were not optimally collected (ie not evaluable), and all other specimens were classified as unknown. Participants must have been classified as PD-L1 \>=5% or PD-L1 \<5% per a verified IHC assay, or as indeterminate (ie not unknown), in order to be randomized., From randomization until disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (Assessed up to September 2016, approximately 39 months)|Overall Survival Based on PD-L1 Expression Level, OS was defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of death. For participants without documentation of death, OS was censored on the last date the participant was known to be alive., From randomization until death (assessed up to approximately 128 months)|Mean Change From Baseline in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) Global Health Status, Health Related Quality of Life was assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire Version 3.
