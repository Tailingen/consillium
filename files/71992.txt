CT-based Radiomics of ALN pCR (ypN0) in Breast Cancer Undergoing NAC
This is a prospective, single-center, non-randomized, non-controlled observational study.
Triple-negative Breast Cancer|HER2-positive Breast Cancer
The features of CT-based radiomics for axillary lymph node achieved pCR after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, Sensitivity, specificity, positive-predictive value (PPV) and negative-predictive value (NPV) of CT-based radiomics for axillary lymph node status after neoadjuvant chemotherapy will be assessed., within 8 weeks after obtaining the post-surgery pathological results
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, The diagnostic performance of CT-based radiomics for the evaluation of ALN after NAC was evaluated with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The diagnostic accuracy was estimated by calculating the area under the ROC curve, within 8 weeks after obtaining the post-surgery pathological results
Almost 55-62% of patients with triple-negative or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive, node-positive breast cancer achieve an axillary pathologic complete remission (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). To avoid surgery post-NAC, it is paramount to accurately identify patients who achieve pCR in axillary lymph node (ALN). We found that patients with normal-appearing lymph nodes on computed tomography (CT) based radiomics of the axilla after chemotherapy had a lower risk of developing residual nodal disease. However, the features of CT-based radiomics for pCR ALN following NAC has not been established yet. This study aimed to assess the performance of CT-based radiomics in evaluating the response and predicting pCR of metastatic lymph nodes after NAC in breast cancer patients.
