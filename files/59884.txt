Neoadjuvant Short-course Hypofractionated PBT for Non-metastatic RPS
The investigators' study titled "PROTONS-RPS: a Phase II non-Randomized Open-label single-arm Trial Of Neoadjuvant Short-course hypofractionated proton beam therapy for non-metastatic RetroPeritoneal Sarcoma" is a phase II trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of hypofractionated proton beam therapy (H-PBT) in the neoadjuvant (NA) setting for patients with non-metastatic retroperitoneal sarcoma (RPS) planned for surgical resection. This trial will include adult patients with resectable RPS.
Retroperitoneal Sarcoma
RADIATION: Hypofractionated Proton Beam Therapy
Overall serious adverse event rate for patients with primary resectable RPS receiving NA short-course h-PBT followed by surgical resection, Incidence of acute Grade 3+ adverse events after PBT and surgical resection during median follow-up based on the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0., 24 months
Safety of NA short-course hypofractionated PBT for primary resectable RPS as assessed by incidence of acute Grade 3+ adverse events, Safety determined by incidence of acute Grade 3+ adverse events per the NCI CTCAE v5.0 in patients on treatment with H-PBT prior to surgical resection., Up to 6 weeks|Tolerability of NA short-course hypofractionated PBT for primary resectable RPS as assessed by cessation of NA H-PBT due to toxicity or required dose reduction for serious adverse events, Lack of tolerability determined by cessation of NA H-PBT due to toxicity or required dose reduction for serious adverse events (NCI CTCAE v5.0)., Up to 6 weeks|Rate of local or distant tumor progression from diagnosis to time of surgery after treatment with PBT, Local or distant tumor progression based on RECIST 1.1 criteria on pre-operative contrast-enhanced CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvic compared to staging CT., Up to 6 weeks (pre-operatively)|Rate of acute post-operative surgical complications in patients receiving NA short-course hypofractionated PBT, Incidence of 30-day (acute) post-operative complications based on Clavien-Dindo classification., 30 days after surgery|Local recurrence-free survival (LRFS), Time from study enrollment to the earliest of local recurrence, death, or loss to follow-up after NA short-course h-PBT and resection. Recurrence will be determined on CT of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis at 6-month intervals for 2 years., Every 6 months, Up to 2 years
The investigators' primary outcome is overall complication rate after treatment with NA H-PBT and surgical resection based on National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0.2 Secondary objectives include evaluating the acute toxicity of H-PBT prior to surgical resection, rate of progression between diagnosis and definitive resection, early post-operative complication rate after resection of RPS in patients who received NA H-PBT, and local recurrence-free survival at 1 and 2 years. A priori subset analyses will be conducted for patients with well-differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcoma.

The investigators plan to accrue a minimum of 44 patients to evaluate the investigators' primary outcome. Treatment will be 5 doses of H-PBT including a simultaneous integrated boost to at-risk margins followed by surgical resection after 4-6 weeks. Patients will be followed in the post-operative setting according to standard of care surveillance for RPS.
