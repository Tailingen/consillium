A Supervised Clinic-to-Community Exercise Intervention to Improve Cardiometabolic Health in Survivors of AYA Cancer
The main goal of this clinical trial is to use a novel exercise intervention to improve cardiometabolic and biopsychosocial health outcomes in overweight/obese sedentary survivors of AYA cancers at risk for chronic comorbid conditions. The investigator's hypothesis is that an exercise intervention will improve: cardiometabolic health; body composition; physical fitness and biopsychosocial outcomes when compared to the attention control group.
