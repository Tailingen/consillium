Since 2003 the Danish national standard treatment for T1aN0M0 glottic SCC has been accelerated RT (66Gy. 2 GY/fraction, 6 fractions/week). In 2012 cordectomy type I-III using TLM was introduced as an experimental treatment.

The DAHANCA 27 trial is a comparative non-inferiority phase II study comparing two timely separated national patient cohorts. Patients treated with radical TLM from September 2012 to April 2016 were included in the TLM cohort, and patients treated with accelerated RT from January 2003 to august 2012 were included in the RT cohort
