Study of RP2 Monotherapy and RP2 in Combination With Nivolumab in Patients With Solid Tumors
RP2-001-18 is a Phase 1, multicenter, open label, single agent dose escalation and combination treatment study of RP2 in adult subjects with advanced solid tumors, to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), as well as to evaluate preliminary efficacy.

RP2 is a genetically modified herpes simplex type 1 virus (HSV-1) that expresses an anti-CTLA-4 antibody and is designed to directly destroy tumors and to generate an anti-tumor immune response. This is a Phase 1, multicenter, open label, dose escalation and expansion, first-in-human (FIH) clinical study to evaluate the safety and tolerability, biodistribution, shedding, and preliminary efficacy of RP2 alone and in combination with nivolumab in adult subjects with advanced solid tumors.

The study will be conducted in two parts. The first part of the study is an open-label, dose escalation FIH Phase 1 study to assess the safety and tolerability of RP2 and to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) to be used in the second part of the study. The second part of the study is an open label design to further investigate safety of RP2 in combination with nivolumab. It will also assess the biological activity of multiple doses of RP2 in combination with nivolumab. An expansion to the second part of the study will include enrolment of a further 30 patients on RP2 in combination with nivolumab.

Following completion of the expansion in part 2, part 3 will enroll a further 15 patients on RP3 monotherapy.

The expansion to part 2 and part 3 will focus on patients with advanced or metastatic uveal melanoma, lung cancer, breast cancer or GI cancers and patients with liver metastasis.
