A Dose Escalation Study of Adavosertib (MK-1775) in Combination With Either Gemcitabine, Cisplatin, or Carboplatin in Adults With Advanced Solid Tumors (MK-1775-001)
This study will investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK), and pharmacodynamic (PD) activity of adavosertib, both as monotherapy and in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin in participants with advanced solid tumors. Dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of adavosertib in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin will also be assessed. The primary hypotheses of the study are as follows: 1) Oral administration of adavosertib both as monotherapy and in combination with either gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin in patients with advanced solid tumors will be safe and tolerable, 2) The side effects observed in participants with advanced solid tumors after administration of adavosertib combined with each of the chemotherapies (gemcitabine, cisplatin and carboplatin) will allow for the definition of a single dose combination Maximum Administered Dose (MAD)/Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and a multiple dose combination Biologically Effective Dose (BED)/MTD for each of the 3 combinations, 3) At a tolerated dose, adavosertib plasma exposure will exceed target thresholds established in preclinical models, and 4) At a tolerated dose, PD markers of adavosertib activity in combination with either gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin (in surrogate tissue and/or tumor) will meet or exceed the target threshold established in preclinical models.

Number of Participants Experiencing Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), DLTs were adverse events (AEs) considered at least possibly related to study drug that prevented escalation of the drug dose. Hematologic DLTs were any grade (Gr) 4-5 toxicity EXCEPT: Gr 4 anemia and Gr 4 leukopenia, Gr 4 neutropenia lasting for \<7 days, Gr 4 thrombocytopenia lasting for \<4 days except if a platelet transfusion is required, and Gr 3/Gr 4 neutropenia with fever \>38.5°C and/or infection requiring antibiotic or anti-fungal treatment. Non-hematologic DLT was defined as any Gr 3, 4, or 5 non-hematologic toxicity EXCEPT: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or dehydration (all Gr 3) occurring in a setting of inadequate compliance with supportive care measures and lasting for \<48 hours, alopecia of any grade, inadequately treated hypersensitivity reactions, and clinically non-significant, treatable or reversible lab abnormalities including liver function tests, uric acid, etc., Part 1: Up to 14 days, Part 2: Up to 28 days|Percentage of Total Cyclin-dependent Kinase (CDC2)-Positive Cells That Were Phosphorylated (pCDC2) in Skin Cells at Baseline and 8 Hours After MK-1775 Dosing, The pCDC2 level in skin cells was used as a marker to evaluate MK-1775 activity. Analysis was done by immunohistochemistry and the percentage of total CDC2-positive cells that were pCDC2 positive (% pCDC2-positive cells) at baseline and 8 hours after MK-1775 dosing were reported for participants in Part 1, 2-A, and 2-B/3 treatment groups with available data per protocol., Baseline, 8 hours after first MK-1775 dose|Percentage of Total pCDC2 in Skin Cells at Baseline and 24 Hours After MK-1775 Dosing, The pCDC2 level in skin cells was used as a marker to evaluate MK-1775 activity. Analysis was done by immunohistochemistry and the percentage of total pCDC2 at baseline and 24 hours after MK-1775 dosing were reported for participants in the Part 2-B/3 MK-1775 QD x2 Multi Dose plus Gemcitabine treatment groups with available data per protocol., Baseline, 24 hours after first MK-1775 dose|Percentage of Total pCDC2 in Skin Cells at Baseline and 48 Hours After MK-1775 Dosing, The pCDC2 level in skin cells was used as a marker to evaluate MK-1775 activity. Analysis was done by immunohistochemistry and the percentage of total pCDC2 at baseline and at 48 hours after MK-1775 dosing were reported for participants in the Part 2-B/3 MK-1775 (150 mg, 200 mg, 250) BID x 2.5 Multi Dose plus cisplatin 75 mg/m\^2 groups and the 325 mg BID x2.5 Multi Dose + Carboplatin group with available data per protocol., Baseline, 48 hours after first MK-1775 dose|Plasma Concentration of MK-1775 at 8 Hours After Administration (C8hr) of Single or Multiple Oral Doses, MK-1775 was measured in the plasma at 8 hours after dosing (Day 1 for single dose of monotherapy, Day 2 of single-dose combination therapy and QD x 2 Combination dosing, and Day 3 dose for BID X 2.5 combination dosing) for participants with available data., 8 hours after MK-1775 dose|Mean Urine Excretion of MK-1775 24 Hours After the Day 1 Monotherapy Dose, The mean cumulative amount of MK-1775 excreted unchanged in urine after a single oral dose was measured during the initial monotherapy cycle of the study. For this outcome measure, samples were collected and analyzed only for the MK-1775 monotherapy arms of the study at defined intervals after the Day 1 dose of monotherapy. Part 2 MK-1775 combination arms were not sampled per protocol., At 0-4 hours, 4-8 hours, and 12-24 hours post Day 1 dose of monotherapy
Best Overall Response as Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Criteria, Best overall response achieved by a participant. Starting at Day 1, participants in Part 2 were evaluated for tumor response every 6-8 weeks until discontinuation from study treatment according to RECIST criteria; which are based on radiographic imaging. Recorded responses were either confirmed by Central Review or unconfirmed (Investigator assessment only), and included complete response (CR; defined as disappearance of all target lesions), partial response (PR; at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter \[LD\] of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD), stable disease (SD; neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient growth to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started), or progressive disease (PD; ≥20% increase in sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started, or the appearance of one or more new lesions)., From Day 1 up through discontinuation of study treatment (up to ~11.2 months)
Part 1 consists of single dose adavosertib monotherapy. If well tolerated, participants in Part 1 will continue on to one of three treatment arms in Part 2-A which consists of a single lower dose of adavosertib in combination with standard chemotherapy: 1) Adavosertib +Gemcitabine (1000 mg/m\^2), 2) Adavosertib + Cisplatin (75 mg/m\^2) or 3) Adavosertib +Carboplatin at an area under the time curve concentration of 5 mg/min/ml (AUC5). Following completion of Part 2-A, adavosertib will be administered twice daily (BID) for 2.5 days (multi-dose) starting concomitantly with each administration of chemotherapy in Part 2-B. After a preliminary combination MTD of adavosertib and chemotherapy has been established in Part 2B, the MTD confirmation expansion will occur in Part 3.
