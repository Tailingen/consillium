Endoscopic Thyroidectomy Versus Open Thyroidectomy for Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma
Recently, endoscopic thyroidectomy using gasless unilateral transaxillary approach has been proven feasible and safe in several Chinese medical centers. This study is aimed to compare multi-institutional Chinese outcomes of endoscopic thyroidectomy using gasless unilateral transaxillary approach and conventional open surgery.

Most patients with thyroid tumors are effectively treated surgically by practitioners experienced in the techniques of thyroidectomy. Many patients, especially women, undergoing thyroid surgery are concerned about the postoperative cosmetic appearance of the neck. Endoscopic thyroidectomy using gasless unilateral transaxillary approach which can hide the operative scar was associated with a higher degree of patient cosmetic satisfaction. Recently, endoscopic thyroidectomy using gasless unilateral transaxillary approach has been proven feasible and safe in several Chinese medical centers. In this study, we designed a prospective study comparing multi-institutional Chinese outcomes of endoscopic thyroidectomy using gasless unilateral transaxillary approach and conventional open surgery.
