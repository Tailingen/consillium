Safety Evaluation of Autologous Dendritic Cell Anticancer Immune Cell Therapy (Cellgram-DC-PC)
This Phase 1 study to evaluate the safety of cancer immunotherapy with autologous dendritic cells(DC) in patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC)
Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer, CRPC
BIOLOGICAL: Cellgram-DC-PC
The Measure CTCAE of Safety, The level of Adverse Event (AE) is described in accordance with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (CTCAE) (Version 5.0)., For 28 weeks
Immune response evaluation (INF-r), The tumor antigen-specific immune response induced after administration compared to before Investigational Product(IP) administration was confirmed by measuring changes in the secretion of cytokines INF-r in serum (ELISA)., 0, 2, 8, 16 and 28 weeks|Immune response evaluation (IL-12), The tumor antigen-specific immune response induced after administration compared to before Investigational Product(IP) administration was confirmed by measuring changes in the secretion of cytokines IL-12 in serum (ELISA)., 0, 2, 8, 16 and 28 weeks|Measurement of changes in tumor marker test results (PSA), Changes in tumor marker test results (PSA) are measured at each time point (V4, V5, V6, V7, V8) after administration compared to before (V3) Investigational Product(IP) administration., 0, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 28 weeks
To evaluate the safety of an autologous dendritic cell anticancer immune cell therapy (Cellgram-DC-PC) for the treatment of prostate cancer in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.
