Clinical Applications of Integrated PET/MR and PET/CT in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Prostate Cancer.
The goal of this study type: observational study (prospective study) is to study prostate cancer occurrence and recurrence, to specifically identify and localize tumor foci at the molecular level at an early stage, to evaluate the prognosis of patients, and to accurately stage not only intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer patients with a primary diagnosis, but also detect recurrent foci in patients with biochemical recurrence, to restage those who have developed metastases, to assess tumor load, and to ultimately assist in determining the personalized treatment plans. The main question it aims to answer is whether 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT (PET/MR) examination is beneficial for assessing the

* Accurate staging of patients with intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer at first diagnosis;
* Detecting recurrent lesions in patients with recurrent tumors for re-staging;
* Assessment of tumor load;
* Assessment of patient prognosis. Participants will sign an informed consent form, undergo 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT (PET/MR) before surgery or biopsy, and have regular follow-up after obtaining pathological results of surgical resection or puncture biopsy, 6 weeks after surgery or biopsy, and then every 3 months; the follow-up will include: blood PSA, whole-body bone imaging, etc.

1. Title of research programme Clinical application of integrated PET/MR and PET/CT in the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer
2. Research background Prostate cancer is the most common malignant tumor of the urinary system. Current diagnostic tools for prostate cancer include serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test, transrectal prostate aspiration biopsy, etc. However, these tools are often invasive. When a patient's PSA rises again after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer, conventional CT, MRI, and bone scintigraphy do not have a high detection rate (11%); Although multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is of undisputed importance in the T-staging of tumors, it has limited diagnostic accuracy when applied alone and is less sensitive in the diagnosis of local lymph node metastases. Currently, PET/CT has been gradually applied to different types and stages of prostate cancer. With the popularity of integrated PET/MR imaging, combining the higher resolution and morphological performance of MR imaging with the N-staging and M-staging of PET, the specificity of primary prostate cancer diagnosis can be greatly improved.

   Currently, the commonly used targeted tracers for PET examination of prostate cancer include 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG), and 18F-/11C-acetate, etc., but their imaging effects are not up to the ideal level. PSMA is located in prostate epithelial cells and is converted to a membrane-bound protein in prostate cancer, and PSMA expression is approximately 100 to 1000 times higher in prostate cancer tissue compared to normal prostate tissue. PSMA is expressed at high levels in 95% of prostate cancer patients and is upregulated in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and metastatic prostate cancer. PSMA expression was also increased after androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). The use of 68Ga-labelled PSMA small molecule inhibitors can be specifically combined with prostate cancer cells, and it is important for the diagnosis of prostate cancer and its metastatic foci through PET/CT and PET/MR visualization. 68Ga-PSMA 617 was first applied to prostate cancer patients in 2015, Afshar-Oromieh et al. conducted the first evaluation of the human biological distribution, radiation dose of this contrast agent and found that there was uptake in the kidney and salivary glands, and the detection rate of prostate cancer lesions was 73.7% (14/19). The best imaging results were obtained 2-3 h after injection, with an average radiation dose of about 0.021 mSv/mbq.
3. Research purpose This study is expected to be used for prostate cancer occurrence and recurrence, early specific identification and localization of tumor foci at the molecular level, and evaluation of patient prognosis. Not only can it accurately stage first-time intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer patients, but it can also detect recurrent lesions in biochemically recurrent patients. Those who develop metastases are restaged to assess tumor load and ultimately assist in determining a personalized treatment plan.
