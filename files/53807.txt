Immunotherapy of Cancer Using Donor Lymphocytes Labelled With In-vitro Bispecific Antibodies.
Patients with resistant metastatic solid tumors failing all conventional modalities who are eligible for immunotherapy by bispecific antibodies.

First step: NST Second step: Patients with tumor cells expressing positive Her-2Neu and/or EpCAM with residual or recurrent disease following NST will be candidates for donor lymphocytes immunotherapy using bispecific antibodies.

Patients with no matched donor available, expressing positive Her-2Neu and/or EpCAM tumor cells, will be eligible for donor mismatched lymphocytes using in-vitro rIL-2 activated allogeneic lymphocytes targeted to the tumor by bispecific antibodies, Her-2Neu and/or EpCAM.
