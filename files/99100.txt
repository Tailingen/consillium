Radioactive Iodide (131I) Treatment of 124I PET/CT Detected Breast Cancers
This is a treatment protocol designed to accompany the ongoing institutional 124I PET/CT pilot imaging study for patients with invasive breast cancer. Women whose tumors express NIS \[Na+I- symporter, sodium iodide symporter\] and demonstrate radioiodide uptake on 124I PET/CT scans will be eligible for 131I treatment if, (1) tumor dosimetry calculations yield a cumulative radiation dose of at least 30Gy in target tumor, (2) estimated cumulative thyroid irradiation is less than 500 cGy and, (3) the therapeutic dose of 131I is in the range of 25 to 100 mCi.

PROCEDURE: 124 PET/CT imaging|DRUG: Na134I|DRUG: Tri-iodothyronine|DRUG: Tri-iodothyronine
Target lesion size will be assessed clinically or radiologically in two directions . RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors) will be implemented to determine response, * cCR (complete clinical response) = disappearance of all tumor
* cPR (clinical partial response) = \>=30% decrease sum of longest target lesion diameters
* cPD (progressive disease) = \>=20% increase sum of longest target lesion diameters.
* cSD (stable disease) = small changes that do not meet these criteria, 6 WEEKS POST-TREATMENT
Non target lesion size will be assessed clinically or radiologically in two directions . RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors) will be implemented to determine response, * Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions
* Incomplete Response/Stable Disease (SD): Persistence of one or more non-target lesions(s)
* Progressive Disease (PD): Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions, EVALUATED AT 6 WEEKS
