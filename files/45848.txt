Phase II Study of Anti-PD-1/VEGF Bispecific Antibody Ivonescimab in Patients With Previously Treated Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if ivonescimab can help to control previously treated, metastatic colorectal cancer.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Ivonescimab
1. Safety and Adverse Events (AEs), Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, Through study completion; an average of 1 year
Primary Objective:

• To evaluate the efficacy of ivonescimab, as determined by the objective response rate per iRECIST, in three distinct cohorts of patients with treatment-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer: 1) dMMR/MSI-H refractory to anti-PD-1 therapy, 2) pMMR/MSS without liver metastases, and 3) pMMR/MSS with liver metastases.

Secondary Objective:

• To evaluate the safety of ivonescimab in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.

Exploratory Objectives:

* To assess the time to response following treatment with ivonescimab in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.
* To assess the durability of response following treatment with ivonescimab in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.
* To evaluate progression-free survival following treatment with ivonescimab in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.
* To evaluate overall survival following treatment with ivonescimab in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.
* To investigate clinical, pathologic, and molecular features associated with therapeutic response to ivonescimab in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.
