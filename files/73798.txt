Application of SERS Technology in Clinical Diagnosis and Prognosis of Lung Cancer Immunotherapy
The aim of this study is to explore the application of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) technology and specific PD-L1 detection fluorescent probes in the clinical diagnosis and prognosis of lung cancer immunotherapy, and further promote the rapid diagnosis of lung cancer and the precision of tumor immunotherapy.
Lung Cancer
OS, Time from randomization to death (from any cause)., From date of diagnosis until the date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months|PFS, The time between the initiation of randomization and the occurrence (any aspect) of tumor progression or death (from any cause)., From date of diagnosis until the date of first documented progression from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months|ORR, Refers to the proportion of subjects whose tumors shrink by a certain amount and remain for a certain period of time, including those with CR+PR., The proportion of patients who achieved a 30%(usual) reduction in tumor volume while maintaining the minimum required duration was calculated at month 24 of the study|DOR, Is the time from the first documented response (CR or PR) to the first documented disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., The time from first diagnosis of CR or PR to diagnosis of PD was calculated at 24 months of study.
The aim of this study is to explore the application of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) system in the diagnosis of benign and malignant lung cancer biopsy, and to promote the rapid diagnosis of lung cancer. In addition, the correlation between tumor PH value, PD-L1 expression detected by fluorescent probes and the efficacy and prognosis of immunotherapy was explored. Based on this, the immunotherapy efficacy and prognosis prediction models based on patients' clinical information, PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry, PD-L1 expression by fluorescent probes and PH value detected by SERS were constructed to promote the precision of tumor immunotherapy.
