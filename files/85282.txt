Determine Safety & Recommended Phase 2 Dosing of Zeaxanthin Alone or in Combination w/Pembrolizumab in Patients With Metastatic Cancer
The purpose of the research is to determine the highest dose of an oral compound called zeaxanthin that can be safely taken each day in patients with advanced cancer, the toxicity profile of zeaxanthin, and the dose of zeaxanthin to use in future cancer clinical trials.

The primary purpose of the study is to determine the safety and optimal dosing of zeaxanthin. Effects on tumor growth will also be looked at but as a secondary endpoint. This study will use a 3+3 design which means that 3 people will receive a certain dose of zeaxanthin and if well tolerated then the next group of people will receive a higher dose. This dose escalation will continue until the highest dose allowed by the study is reached, or a dose is found that is felt not to be safe. If at a given dose one of the three people develops a severe side effect, then three more people will be treated at that dose. If no additional severe side effects develop, then the dose escalation will continue. If two people at a given dose develop severe side effects, that dose will be considered dose limiting and escalation will stop. The doses of zeaxanthin will be based on weight starting with 2 milligrams of zeaxanthin per kilogram of body weight (mg/kg) followed by 4 mg/kg, 6 mg/kg, and finally 8 mg/kg. If a dose level is found to be unsafe, then a new group of patients will be treated at the midpoint dose between the not tolerated dose and the last tolerated dose. Zeaxanthin is supplied as 50 milligram capsules and a person's dose will be rounded to the nearest 50 milligrams.
