RFA for Treatment of Intermediate Stage HCC
In Egypt, chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the most prevalent cause of hepatoma. The study aims to evaluate the percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) efficacy as monotherapy in intermediate versus early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The present study was a single-center, prospective non-randomized, controlled clinical trial in the Interventional Ultrasonography Unit, Tropical Medicine Department, Beni-Suef University Hospitals, between October 2018 and August 2021. Abdominal ultrasonography and triphasic computerized tomography (CT) abdomen were used to diagnose HCC. The abdominal ultrasonography and a dynamic CT scan were performed six weeks following the ablation to assess treatment efficacy.
