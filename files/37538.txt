A Study of the Body's Response to Exercise and a Plant-Based Diet in Overweight Postmenopausal Women With Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, if any, exercise and a plant-based diet have on aromatase levels in postmenopausal women who are overweight and being treated with an aromatase inhibitor for their HR+ breast cancer. The study will also look at other ways diet and exercise may affect your body (for example, changing the way your breast tissue expresses or makes genes) and your quality of life.

change in breast aromatase levels, Will explore the data using descriptive statistics and graphical methods, such as summarizing the aromatase levels at baseline and at 24 weeks using means and medians and plotting the data to visualize changes over time. To compare the aromatase levels at 24 weeks post-intervention between the groups, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model will be used., 24 weeks post-intervention
