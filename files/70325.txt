Safety and Efficacy of Etanercept (Recombinant Human Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Fusion Protein [TNFR:Fc]) in Children With Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis (JRA)
The primary objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of etanercept in children with polyarticular course JRA.
Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis
DRUG: Etanercept|DRUG: Placebo
Percentage of Participants With Disease Flare in Part 2, Disease flare was defined as a 30% or greater worsening in three of the six JRA Core Set Criteria and â‰¥ 30% improvement in one or less of the six JRA Core Set Criteria compared to day 90 and a minimum of two active joints (joints with swelling or limitation of movement plus pain and/or tenderness).

The JRA Core Set criteria consisted of:

* Physician global assessment of disease severity assessed on a visual analog scale (VAS) from 0 (asymptomatic) to 10 (severe symptoms);
* Patient/parent global assessment of overall well-being assesses on a VAS from 0 (asymptomatic) to 10 (severe symptoms);
* Number of active joints;
* Number of joints with limitation of motion (LOM) and with pain, tenderness, or both;
* Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ) disability domain;
* Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)., End of part 1 (day 90) and months 4 to 7
Time to Flare in Part 2, The time from day 90 to flare. Participants who withdrew without flare were censored at the time of withdrawal., Months 4 to 7|Number of Participants With Adverse Events, Part 1: 90 days (months 1-3) plus 30 days for participants who were not randomized into part 2. Part 2: From first dose of randomized treatment to 30 days after last dose (150 days; months 4-8).
This was a two-part study. In the first part of the study, all participants received open-label etanercept twice a week for 90 days. At the end of the 90 days, participants with disease response as defined by the JRA Definition of Improvement (DOI) using the JRA Core Set Criteria were randomized in part 2 of the study to receive placebo or continued administration of etanercept until either disease flare occurred or 4 months elapsed, whichever was earlier.

Participants who did not meet the DOI at day 90, participants who had disease flare during part 2 and participants who completed the blinded part of the study were eligible to receive open-label treatment with etanercept under protocol 16.0018 (NCT00357903).
