Treatment Decision-Making Among Patients Diagnosed With Papillary Microcarcinoma and Their Significant Others
The purpose of this study is to understand more about why some patients choose to have surgery to treat their papillary microcarcinoma (PMC) and others choose to have their papillary microcarcinoma (PMC) regularly watched by their doctor to see if and when they may need surgery (referred to as "active surveillance"). The investigators also hope learn more about what patients and their family members worry about or feel they will gain from surgery or active surveillance.

To explore patients' and families' perceived risks and benefits of active surveillance and surgery within the context of papillary microcarcinoma., We'll conduct focus groups \& individual interviews with 2 population segments established by the method of Krueger \& Casey \& Morgan. The population segments will be thyroid cancer patients who have had surg or have scheduled surg, \& any pt-designated significant others who assisted pts with tx decision-making \& thyroid cancer pts who chose to not have immediate surg, whether they are either postponing their tx decision until a later date, or have committed to active surveillance rather than surg, \& any pt-designated significant others who assisted these patients with tx decision-making., 5 years
