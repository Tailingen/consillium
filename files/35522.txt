Evaluation of the Use of AZD6244 to Induce Increased ER Expression and Anti-Estrogen Response in ER-Negative/Low Breast Cancer
If AZD6244 is able to increase ER expression in ER-negative/low cancers then it may be possible to effectively use hormonal therapy in these patients resulting in improved outcomes. The investigators propose a single-arm Simon two-step study to examine whether treatment with AZD6244 will result in increased ER expression in ER-negative/low primary breast tumors.

DRUG: AZ6244
Increase of ER Protein Expression in ER-Negative/Low Breast Cancer, To evaluate in a clinical neoadjuvant model whether MEK inhibitor AZD6244 can increase ER protein expression in ER-negative/low breast cancer, as measured by the "ER response rate" by both standard immunohistochemistry and Allred Score., 2 years
Changes in ER-regulated Gene Expression in E-negative/Low Breast Cancer, To assess for changes in ER-regulated gene expression in ER-negative/low breast tumors following AZD6244 therapy through assessment of protein expression by immunhistochemistry in paraffin embedded tissues., 2 Years|Rate of ER Promoter Methylation in ER-negative/Low Breast Cancer, To determine the rate of ER promoter methylation in ER-negative/low breast cancer tumors that do not attain an ER response following AZD6244 therapy., 2 years|In Vitro Tamoxifen Response in Tumors, To assess for in vitro tamoxifen response in tumors following therapy with AZD6244., 2 years
