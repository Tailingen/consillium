Total Neoadjuvant Treatment ±Immunotherapy for High Risk Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer (TNTi)
The goal of this clinical trial is to compare the PCR rate between Total Neoadjuvant Treatment ±Immunotherapy in high risk locally advanced rectal cancer. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* The PCR rate between the two groups
* The 3years DFS between the two groups
* Chemoradiotherapy and immunotherapy toxicity
* Postoperative complications Participants will receive total neoadjuvant treatment ±immunotherapy followed by surgery.

Researchers will compare neoadjuvant treatment ±immunotherapy to see the PCR rate.
