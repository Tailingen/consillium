Study With Temsirolimus Added to Standard Chemotherapy for Patients Over 60 Years With Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia
Standard chemotherapy is capable of eliminating most leukemic blasts in acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), while leukemia-initiating cells are not sufficiently eradicated. As a consequence, refractory disease and relapse frequently occur in AML, especially in elderly patients. The investigators propose that the addition of temsirolimus may improve standard AML chemotherapy. Furthermore, temsirolimus may specifically target the leukemia-initiating cells in AML, thereby reducing the risk of leukemia relapse.

The study's main part is preceded by a open label run-in part, in which optimal temsirolimus dose and schedule for the main part o the study will be determined.
