Cold Snare Piecemeal Resection vs Cold Snare Endoscopic Mucosal Resection
The study will compare the use of cold snare piecemeal resection (CSPR) vs cold endoscopic mucosal resection (Cold EMR). The study will include two cohorts: one cohort for conventional adenomas 10-19mm in size and one cohort for serrated lesions 10mm or larger.

PROCEDURE: Cold Snare Piecemeal Resection (CSPR)|PROCEDURE: Cold Snare Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (Cold EMR)
Efficacy of Resection (Central Post-Resection Biopsies), Efficacy of resection will be assessed by biopsies in four or six quadrants of the perimeter of the defect post-resection and two biopsies from the center of the defect post-resection.
