Phase Ib Study of PI3(Phosphoinositol 3)-Kinase Inhibitor Copanlisib With MEK (Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase) Inhibitor Refametinib (BAY86-9766) in Patients With Advanced Cancer
The PI3K (phosphoinositol 3-Kinase) inhibitor Copanlisib and the MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) inhibitor Refametinib (BAY86-9766)have both been tested as single agent treatments in other phase I studies. This study will test the combination of these two drugs to try and answer the following questions:

1. What are the side effects of the combination of Copanlisib and Refametinib (BAY86-9766)when given together at different/increasing dose levels?
2. What dose level of Copanlisib and Refametinib (BAY86-9766) should be tested in future clinical research studies?
3. How much Copanlisib is in the blood at specific times after administration and does adding Refametinib (BAY86-9766) have an affect?
4. How much Refametinib (BAY86-9766) is in the blood at specific times after administration and does adding Copanlisib have an affect?
5. Does the combination of Refametinib (BAY86-9766) and Copanlisib have an effect on tumors?
