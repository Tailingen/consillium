Laparoscopic Interval Cytoreductive Surgery in Advance Ovarian Cancer
This is a study that aims to demonstrate the non-inferiority of minimally invasive surgery versus open surgery, as an approach for patients with advanced ovarian cancer who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, giving them the benefits of laparoscopic surgery. This way they can continue with their complementary treatment.
Ovarian Neoplasms
PROCEDURE: Interval Cytoreduction Surgery
Efficiency of Laparoscopic Interval Cytoreductive Surgery After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Patients with Stage III and IV Epithelial Ovarian Cancer, Efficiency of laparoscopic interval surgery will be evaluated according to percentage of patients who achieved optimal cytoreduction compared to the reported rates in the literature (70 -80%) and the measured frequency of complications during the 30 day postoperative period. Severity of complications will be measured using the Clavien Dindo scale (Grade I: any deviation from the normal post operative course without need for pharmacological treatment - Grade V: death), 1 year
