A Study of Venetoclax in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma
This is a Phase 2, open-label, multicenter study, evaluating the efficacy of venetoclax in participants with relapsed or refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL) either in presence of 17p deletion (Cohort 1) or those who have failed a B-receptor signaling pathway inhibitor (BCRI) therapy and who have also failed, or were unable to receive chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) irrespective of 17p status (Cohort 2).
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)|Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL)
DRUG: Venetoclax
Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is the proportion of participants with an overall response (complete remission \[CR\], plus complete remission with incomplete bone marrow recovery \[CRi\], plus nodular partial remission \[nPR\], plus partial remission \[PR\]) per the National Cancer Institute-Working Group (NCI-WG) guidelines as assessed by the Independent Review Committee (IRC)., Measured up to 2 years after the last participant has enrolled in the study.
Complete Response Rate (CRR), CRR is defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved (CR + CRi) per the 2008 Modified International Workshop for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (iwCLL) NCI-WG criteria., Measured up to 2 years after the last participant has enrolled into the study.|Duration of Overall Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the number of days from the date of first (CR + CRi + nPR + PR) to the earliest disease progression or death, Measured up to 2 years after the last participant has enrolled into the study.|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the number of days from the date of first dose to the date of earliest disease progression (determined by the IRC) or death., Measured up to 5 years after the last participant has enrolled into the study.|Event Free Survival (EFS), EFS is defined as the number of days from the date of first dose to the date of earliest disease progression, death, or start of a new anti-leukemic therapy., Measured up to 5 years after the last participant has enrolled into the study.|Time to Progression (TTP), TTP is defined as the number of days from the date of first dose to the date of earliest disease progression (determined by the IRC)., Measured up to 5 years after the last participant has enrolled into the study.|Time to 50% reduction in absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), Time to 50% reduction in ALC is defined as the number of days from the date of first dose to the date when the ALC has reduced to 50% of the baseline value., Measured up to 2 years after the last participant has enrolled into the study.|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as number of days from the date of first dose to the date of death., Measured up to 5 years after the last participant has enrolled into the study.
