A Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of Pirtobrutinib in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma
The main purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of 3 dose levels of Pirtobrutinib in participants with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), who have received 1-3 lines of treatment including a covalent Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor. The study is expected to last approximately 3 years.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma
DRUG: Pirtobrutinib
Overall Response Rate, Overall response rate is defined as the proportion of participants who achieve the best overall response at or before the initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy of CR, CRi, nPR, or PR. ORR will be assessed using International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (iwCLL) 2018 response criteria., Baseline up to 3 years
Duration of Response, Duration of response is defined as the time from the date of the first documented CR, CRi, nPR, or PR to disease progression (per iwCLL 2018) or death from any cause., Baseline up to 3 years
