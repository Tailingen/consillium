Radiometabolic Therapy With 177Lu PSMA in PSMA PET/CT Positive Advanced/Metastatic Tumours:
Phase 2 study, single arm trial enrolling patients with a Gallium-68/Fluorine-18 prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positive positron emission tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) in order to be treated with Lutetium-177 (177Lu) PSMA.

Patients without risk factors for toxicity will receive 7.4 GBq of 177Lu-PSMA while patients with at least 1 risk factor for toxicity will receive 5.5 GBq of 177Lu-PSMA. Patients will receive 4 cycles every 8 weeks (+- 2 weeks)

Acute toxicity rate, safety is evaluated according to version 5.0 of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). Safety is defined as the percentage of patients who experience acute toxicity grade3/grade4 from the 1st treatment until 30 days after the last treatment cycle., 40 months|disease control rate (DCR), is DCR, defined as the percentage of patients who have achieved complete response, partial response, stable disease (according to RECIST 1.1) or no progression of disease for prostate cancer (according to Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria) at the 1st planned evaluation, 40 months
progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the start treatment date to the date of first observation of documented disease progression (according to RECIST 1.1 or Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group (PCWG3) criteria for prostate cancer patients) or death due to any cause. Patients without tumor progression at the time of analysis will be censored at their last date of tumor evaluation., 68 months|overall survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the time from the therapy start to the date of death due to any cause or the date of last contact (censored observation) at the date of data cut-off., 68 months|late toxicity, The late toxicity is the toxicity that occurred after 30 days from the last treatment administration up to 6 months., 68 months|PET/CT response, PET/CT response is based on Standardized Uptake Value (SUV). PET/CT response will be evaluated with descriptive statistics., 68 months
Since PSMA radioligand therapy (PSMA-RLT) demonstrated remarkable therapeutic efficacy in prostate cancer patients, the question arises whether PSMA-RLT could also achieve beneficial effects in other cancers expressing PSMA on the tumors cells themselves, or in the tumor-associated neovasculature. Expression of PSMA was early-on also identified in kidney, salivary glands, the duodenum and the central and peripheral nervous system. Subsequently, a wide variety of immunohistochemistry (IHC) studies showed PSMA to be upregulated on the endothelial cells of the neovasculature of a wide variety of other solid tumors where it may facilitate endothelial cell sprouting and invasion through its regulation of lytic proteases that have the ability to cleave the extracellular matrix. Similar to the introduction of PSMA-targeting theranostics in prostate carcinoma, overexpression of PSMA on newly formed tumor vessels may serve as a target for imaging and subsequent treatment of cancer through the use of agents that are capable of blocking PSMA in its function or through PSMA-mediated delivery of chemotherapeutics or radiation agents. Preclinical data suggests that PSMA might be involved in cancer-related angiogenesis by degrading the extracellular matrix and participating in integrin signal transduction.
