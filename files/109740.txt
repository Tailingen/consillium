APN01-1-01 is a placebo controlled double blinded Phase I study composed of a single dose, dose escalation part followed by a multiple dosage part. The first four cohorts (four individuals each) will receive 100, 200, 400 and 800 µg/kg APN01 i.v. or placebo. Cohorts 5 and 6 (three individuals each) will receive three and six i.v. APN01 administrations daily, respectively. Planned dosage of the multiple dose part will be 400 µg/kg.
