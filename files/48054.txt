In-Vivo Activated T-Cell Depletion to Prevent GVHD
The purpose of this study is to compare the effects (good and bad) of the medication basiliximab in combination with cyclosporine with cyclosporine alone for the prevention of graft-versus-host disease.

This research is being done because there is no completely safe and effective prevention for graft-versus-host disease. It is known that cyclosporine helps with GVHD but we would like to know if the addition of basiliximab will decrease the incidence and/or severity of GVHD after a transplant known as nonmyeloablative ("mini" transplant).

Number of Patients With Acute Grade II-IV GVHD, Number of patients with Grade II-IV GVHD according to NMDP/CIBMTR GVHD severity scale. This scale measures the degree of GVHD involvement in the patient's skin (inflammatory skin disease), liver (bilirubin levels) and intestinal tract (amount of diarrhea) as well as the level of decline in a patient's activity and physical abilities., until 30 days after stem cell transplant
Number of Patients Engrafting at Day +30 by Short Tandem Repeat (STR) on Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC's)., until 30 days after stem cell transplant|Number of Days for Absolute Neutrophil Count to Recover, Average number of day per patient for absolute neutrophil count to recover(\> 500/mm3 for 3 consecutive days)., From Day -1 (day before stem cell infusion) to Day+20 (20 days after stem cell infusion)|Time to Resolution of Cytopenias: Platelet Transfusion Independence, Average number of days per patient for resolution of cytopenias., From Day -1 (day before stem cell infusion) to Day +20 (20 days after stem cell infusion)|Patients Who Experience Serious Transplant Related Toxicities as Evaluated by Bone Marrow Transplant-adjusted NCI Common Toxicity Criteria., Number of patients who died due to transplant related toxicities, up to 2 years after stem cell transplant
