Sotorasib Combined With First-line Chemotherapy for Advanced Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
The main objective of this trial is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of sotorasib combined with first-line chemotherapy for advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma harboring KRAS p.G12C mutation.
Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: Sotorasib, 960 mg, oral daily dose for 4 weeks (28 days)
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of sotorasib combined with first-line chemotherapy for advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma harboring KRAS p.G12C mutation., Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and related TEAEs (TRAEs) according to CTCAE V5.0., 60 months
To evaluate the progression-free survival assessed by CT or MRI using RECIST 1.1 criteria of first-line chemotherapy combined with sotorasib for advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma harboring KRAS p.G12C mutation, Progression-Free Survival (PFS) is defined as time from the first day of the study treatment (Day 1) until disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, for all patients, according to the investigator criteria., 60 months|To evaluate the overall survival of first-line chemotherapy combined with sotorasib for advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma harboring KRAS p.G12C mutation., The overall survival (OS) is defined as time from Day 1 until death from any cause., 60 months|Overall response (OR), The overall response (OR) is defined as the best overall response complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), assessed per RECIST 1.1., 60 months|Disease control (DC), The disease control (DC) is defined as the best overall response of CR or PR or of stable disease., 60 months|Duration of response (DOR), The duration of response (DOR) is defined as the time from onset of response to progression or death due to any reason, whichever occurs earlier., 60 months|Duration of stable disease, The duration of stable disease is defined as the time from first disease control to disease progression per RECIST 1.1 criteria or death (due to any cause). For patients with disease control who have not progressed or died at last observation, duration of disease control will be censored at their last evaluable disease assessment date., 60 months
This is a phase 2, multicenter and open-label study of first-line chemotherapy (gemcitabine combined with nab-paclitaxel \[gem/nab-P\] or modified FOLFIRINOX \[mFOLFIRINOX\]) in combination with sotorasib for patients with advance pancreatic cancer harboring KRAS p.G12C mutation.The study will be conducted at approximately 25 sites distributed in two countries (Spain and France). The study will consist of a screening period, a treatment period, a safety follow-up (SFU) and long-term follow-up (LTFU) period. A minimum of 6 and a maximum of 15 patients will be enrolled to receive first-line chemotherapy (gem/nab-P or mFOLFIRINOX) in combination with sotorasib 960 mg daily (QD). An interim safety analysis will be conducted by an independent data monitoring committee (DMC) DMC after the first 3 evaluable patients treated with sotorasib combined with gem/nab-P and an additional interim safety analysis with the first 3 evaluable patients treated with sotorasib combined with mFOLFIRINOX have been treated for at least 1 month, respectively. Patients may discontinue treatment because of disease progression, intolerance of treatment leading to treatment discontinuation, initiation of another anticancer therapy, or withdrawal of consent.
