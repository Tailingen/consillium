This is an open-label, single-arm study conducted in adult subjects with R/R LBCL in China to evaluate the pharmacokinetics(PK), safety and efficacy of relma-cel, monitor the immune response after relma-cel treatment.

Relma-cel was approved by the China National Medical Products Administration(NMPA)in September 2021(Acceptance No:CXSS2000036)for the treatment of adult patients with R/R LBCL after second-line or more systemic therapy.The recommended dose is 1×10\^8 CAR+T cells.The indication for this application is R/R LBCL(supplement study) and the recommended dose is 1×10\^8 CAR+T cells.
