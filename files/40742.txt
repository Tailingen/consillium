Icotinib for Completed Resected IB NSCLC With EGFR Mutation
This phase II trial studies how well icotinib works in treating patients with completely resected stage IB NSCLC harboring EGFR mutation.

3-year Disease-Free Survival, 3-year DFS was defined as the percentage of patients who were disease free at 3 years. 3-year DFS were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and the difference in 3-year DFS between groups was compared by the Z test., From randomization to the time of disease recurrence or death as a result of any cause, assessed up to 3 years
Adjuvant chemotherapy have shown little evidence of survival benefit in patients with stages IB non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after complete resection. Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) show great efficacy in patients with EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Icotinib is a novel EGFR-TKI developed by a group of Chinese scientists and clinician. In the phase III ICOGEN trial, icotinib had non-inferiority efficacy to gefitinib with better safety. This study is studying icotinib to see how well it works in treating patients with fully resected stage IB NSCLC harboring EGFR mutation.
