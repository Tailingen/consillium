Pulmonary Rehabilitation After Minimal Invasive Surgery in Lung Cancer
Morbidity in the post-operative phase of pulmonary surgery is characterised by impairment due to pain, dyspnoea and loss of exercise tolerance. We demonstrated previously that rehabilitation after thoracotomy is limited due to pain. Since minimal invasive surgery is the new standard in lung cancer, resulting in a reduction of postoperative pain, we believe there are new possibilities for post-operative integrated multidisciplinary rehabilitation in lung cancer.
