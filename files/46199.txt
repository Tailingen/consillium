In Vitro Activity of Ceftolozane/Tazobactam and Imipenem/Relebactam in Clinical Isolates of Pseudomonas Aeruginosa and Enterobacterales Collected From Hematology and Oncology Patients
The purpose of the ACTHEON Study is to evaluate the in vitro activity of ceftolozane-tazobactam, imipenem-relebactam and comparator agents (amoxicillin- clavulanate, piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, cefepime, imipenem, meropenem, levofloxacin and amikacin; see list more details on page 7) against clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa and Enterobacterales prospectively collected from hematology and oncology patients with complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs), complicated urinary infections (cUTIs), lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), and blood stream infections (BSIs) from 15 participating centers in Spain
