Radiation Therapy and Combination Chemotherapy for Medulloblastoma
This phase II trial is studying giving radiation therapy together with combination chemotherapy after surgery to see how well it works in treating children with newly diagnosed medulloblastoma.
Medulloblastoma
DRUG: Temozolomide|RADIATION: Craniospinal Radiation
Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, first analysis will occur 1 month after accrual of all patients
Progression free survival(PFS), From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months|Overall survival (OS), From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months|Evaluate Rate of Late Neurotoxic Effects, Evaluate the late neurotoxic effects of low dose craniospinal radiation, including cognitive, endocrinologic and auditory function., 3 years
OUTLINE:

Adjuvant induction chemoradiotherapy: Beginning within 28 days after prior resection, patients undergo radiotherapy to the craniospinal axis 5 days a week for 4 weeks and then conformal radiotherapy to the tumor bed 5 days a week for 2 weeks. Beginning 1 week after the initiation of radiotherapy, Temozolomide is applied to these patients as a chemotherapy drug with a dosage of 75mg/m2, daily. The chemotherapy and radiation are combined as temozolomide is taken 1 hour prior to every fraction of radiotherapy.

Maintenance chemotherapy: Beginning 4 weeks after the completion of induction chemoradiotherapy, patients receive eight 4-week cycles of temozolomide (dosage: the 1st cycle, 150mg/m2, daily × 5 days, 4 weeks a cycle; the 2-8th cycle, 200mg/m2, daily × 5 days, 4 weeks a cycle and repeated again).

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.
