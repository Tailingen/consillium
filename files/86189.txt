Cabazitaxel in Relapsed and Metastatic NSCLC
The investigators propose to study the single agent activity of Cabazitaxel in a Phase II trial of subjects with relapsed or refractory non-small cell lung cancer pretreated with docetaxel, given the fact of its significant activity and its acceptable toxicity profile.

DRUG: Cabazitaxel
Overall Response Rate, Disease evaluation at Week 6
Disease control rate, Disease control rate is defined as the proportion of patients with complete response plus partial response plus stable disease, Disease evaluation at Week 6|Progression Free Survival, 1 year|Overall Survival, 1 year|Toxicity profile, Every 3 weeks
Non small cell lung cancer represents the second most common type of cancer in both men and women in the Western world. The availability of new active regimens in the first line setting has prompted several investigators to consider second line therapy for patients with advanced NSCLC, since a substantial percentage of patients maintain a good PS upon recurrence. On the basis of the results of phase III trials docetaxel, erlotinib, gefitinib, or pemetrexed are considered as "standard" choices for second-line therapy.

However, despite the increased availability of different drugs, NSCLC remains a devastating disease with median OS which rarely exceeds 12 months.

Preclinical data of cabazitaxel have demonstrated antitumor activity in models resistant to paclitaxel and docetaxel. In cell lines resistant to cytotoxic agents, cabazitaxel induced further tumor regression.

The recommended phase 2 doses for Cabazitaxle were 20 and 25 mg/m2. Cabazitaxel showed antitumor activity in solid tumors including docetaxel-refractory metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and breast cancer.
