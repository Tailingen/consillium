Safety of Combining Irinotecan With 5-FU, Leucovorin/Folinic Acid, Oxaliplatin, and Docetaxel Chemotherapies
The purpose of the proposed study is to establish the safety of combining irinotecan chemotherapy with 5-FU, leucovorin/folinic acid, oxaliplatin, and docetaxel (abbreviated as the I-FLOAT study of gFOLFOXIRITAX) chemotherapies (leucovorin/folinic acid is a vitamin to make 5-FU work well).

The maximum dose tolerated, To determine the maximum tolerated dose in the first month of therapy in each of the three main genotype groups (low, intermediate, and high risk) using genotype-guided dosing of irinotecan as part of the I-FLOAT regimen, 1 month
Cumulative dose of each chemotherapy drug, To determine the cumulative dose of each chemotherapy drug (irinotecan, 5-FU, oxaliplatin, docetaxel) administered in each genotype group over a period of 4 months (8 doses)., 4 months|Total duration of therapy, To determine the total duration of therapy, which would be administered perioperatively in future studies for the curative-intent setting., 18 months|Overall Response Rate, To determine early efficacy (overall responsive rate, progression free survival, and overall survival) in all patients enrolled and treated in the study., 5 years|Progression free survival rate, To determine early efficacy (overall responsive rate, progression free survival, and overall survival) in all patients enrolled and treated in the study., 5 years|Overall survival rate, To determine early efficacy (overall responsive rate, progression free survival, and overall survival) in all patients enrolled and treated in the study., 5 years
