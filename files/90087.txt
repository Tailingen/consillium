Eligible participants will be those diagnosed with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic histologically documented non-squamous NSCLC with HER2 exons 19 or 20 mutations and who are treatment-na√Øve for palliative intent systemic therapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease.

The study aims to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of trastuzumab deruxtecan as first-line treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) as compared with Standard of Care treatment (Investigator's choice of cisplatin or carboplatin + pembrolizumab + pemetrexed). This study aims to see if trastuzumab deruxtecan allows patients to live longer without the cancer getting worse or simply to live longer, compared to patients receiving standard of care treatment. This study is also looking to see how the treatment and the cancer affects patients' quality of life.
