Patients with newly diagnosed, pathologically confirmed NK/T-cell lymphoma of stage III-IV treated with XCOPL regimen. 3 weeks for a cycle, with a total of 6-8 cycles. Initial safety and PET-CT assessment were performed after 3 cycles of treatment (which could be delayed until 4 cycles of treatment in special cases). Patients who achieved partial remission or above will continue the original regimen, and patients who did not achieve partial remission or above will perform re-biopsy and be excluded from the group. Patients who remain partial remission by PET-CT evaluation after 6 cycles may switch to a second-line regimen (referring to NCCN guidelines, GDP regimen combined with selinexor is recommended). Chemotherapy will be performed for up to 8 cycles (followed by autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation), after which follow-up period was entered. It is recommended to perform ultrasound or CT evaluation, peripheral blood ctDNA and EBV copy number every three months during the first year of follow-up, and PET-CT evaluation every half a year.
