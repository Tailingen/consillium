Association between oral microbioma and (pre)malignant disease., Prevalence of clusters of different oral pathogens will be displayed for patients with malignant disease, premalignant disease and no oral malignancy. Taxonomic representation of statistically and biologically consistent differences between patients with malignant disease, premalignant disease and no oral malignant disease will be displayed., Through study completion, an average of 3 years
To describe the difference in oral microbioma between young (>40 years) patients with oral SCC and older (>40 years) patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma., Prevalence of different oral pathogens will be displayed for patients of both age groups., Through study completion, an average of 3 years|To desribe the difference in oral microbioma and stage of disease upon presentation., Prevalence of different oral pathogens will be displayed for patientgroups with different tumor stages., Through study completion, an average of 3 years
