Temozolomide in Preventing Brain Metastases in Small Cell Lung Cancer
To investigate the response of temozolomide versus prophylactic cranial radiotherapy in preventing brain metastases in completed or partial remission limited small cell lung cancer patients.
Small Cell Lung Cancer|Metastatic Carcinoma
DRUG: temozolomide|RADIATION: prophylaxis cranial radiotherapy
2-year incidence of brain metastases, 2 year
We'd like to investigate the 2-year incidence rate of brain metastases in completed or partial remission limited small cell lung cancer patients who received temozolomide only for 12 months or 25-30Gy prophylactic cranial radiotherapy in preventing brain metastases.
