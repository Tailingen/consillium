A Study of Zanidatamab in Combination With Chemotherapy Plus or Minus Tislelizumab in Patients With HER2-positive Advanced or Metastatic Gastric and Esophageal Cancers
This study is being done to find out if zanidatamab, when given with chemotherapy plus or minus tislelizumab, is safe and works better than trastuzumab given with chemotherapy.

The patients in this study will have advanced human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2)-positive stomach and esophageal cancers that are no longer treatable with surgery (unresectable) or chemoradiation, and/or have grown or spread to other parts of the body (metastatic).
