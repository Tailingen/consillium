The first phase of the study will investigate if there is increased uptake of \[F-18\]FDOPA in pediatric brain tumors when compared to normal brain tissue.
Brain Tumors
DRUG: [F-18]Fluoro-DOPA PET, a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical
Increased uptake of [F-18]FDOPA in pediatric brain tumors compared to contralateral normal brain tissue as measured by standardized uptake value and tumor/non-tumor uptake ratios, 15-30 minutes after IV administration
The first phase of the study will investigate if there is increased uptake of \[F-18\]FDOPA in pediatric brain tumors when compared to normal brain tissue. Tne subjects between ages 5 and 17 years will be studies, to determine if there is increased uptake of \[F-18\]FDOPA in pediatric brain tumors when compared to normal brain tissue. Drug safety will also be monitored.
