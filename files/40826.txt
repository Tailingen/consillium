A Study to Evaluate the Adverse Events, Efficacy, and Optimal Dose of Intravenous (IV) ABBV-400 in Combination With IV Fluorouracil, Leucovorin, and Budigalimab in Adult Participants With Locally Advanced Unresectable or Metastatic Gastric, Gastroesophageal Junction, or Esophageal Adenocarcinoma
Cancer is a condition where cells in a specific part of body grow and reproduce uncontrollably. The purpose of this study is to assess adverse events and change in disease activity when ABBV-400 is given in combination with Fluorouracil, Leucovorin, and a programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD1) inhibitor (Budigalimab) (AFLB) to adult participants to treat locally advanced unresectable or metastatic gastric, gastroesophageal junction, or esophageal adenocarcinoma (mGEA).

ABBV-400 and Budigalimab are investigational drugs being developed for the treatment of mGEA. Fluorouracil and Leucovorin are drugs approved for the treatment of mGEA. This study will be divided into two stages, with the first stage treating participants with increasing doses of ABBV-400 within the AFLB regimen until the dose reached is tolerable and expected to be efficacious. Participants will then be randomized into groups called treatment arms where one group will receive fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX). A further two treatment groups will receive AFLB, but with two optimized doses of ABBV-400 to allow for the best dose to be studied in the future. Approximately 180 adult participants with mGEA will be enrolled in the study in 51 sites worldwide.

In the dose escalation stage participants will be treated with increasing intravenous (IV) doses of ABBV-400 within the AFLB regimen until the dose reached is tolerable and expected to be efficacious. In the dose optimization stage participants will be receive FOLFOX or receive AFLB, but with one of two optimized doses of ABBV-400The study will run for a duration of approximately 6 years.

There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at an approved institution (hospital or clinic). The effect of the treatment will be frequently checked by medical assessments, blood tests, questionnaires and side effects.

Progression-Free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by Investigator, PFS is defined as the time from the first dose of study drug to the first occurrence of radiographic progression based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 as determined by investigator or death from any cause, whichever occurs earlier., Through Study Completion, Approximately 6 Years|Percentage of Participants with Objective Response (OR) as Assessed by Investigator, OR is defined as confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) as assessed by investigator per RECIST version 1.1., Through Study Completion, Approximately 6 Years
Percentage of Participants Achieving Disease Control (DC) as Assessed by Investigator, DC is defined as best overall response of confirmed CR or confirmed PR, or stable disease (SD) (with a minimum duration of 16 weeks) based on RECIST, version 1.1 as determined by the investigator., Through Study Completion, Approximately 6 Years|Duration of Response (DOR) as Assessed by Investigator, DOR is defined as the time from the first documented CR or PR to the first occurrence of radiographic progression per RECIST version 1.1 as determined by investigator or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Through Study Completion, Approximately 6 Years|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from first dose of study drug to the event of death from any cause., Through Study Completion, Approximately 6 Years
