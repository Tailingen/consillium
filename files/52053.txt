First-in-man Dose Escalation Study of BAY1179470 in Patients With Advanced, Refractory Solid Tumors
An open-label, non-randomized, Phase I dose-escalation study designed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics(PK) /pharmacodynamics( PD) and tumor response profile of BAY1179470 in subjects with advanced, refractory solid tumors
Neoplasms
DRUG: BAY1179470
Number of participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, Up to 2 years|Maximum drug concentration versus time curve (AUC) from zero to infinity after single (first) and multiple doses of BAY1179470, Cycle 1 and 2: pre-dose, 0.5, 1 , 2, 3, 5, 8, 24, 48, 72, 168 and 336 hours after start of the infusion, Cycle 3 and 4: pre-dose and 1 hour after start of the infusion; each cycle is 21 days|Maximum drug concentration (Cmax) and minimal drug concentration (Cmin) of BAY1179470 in plasma after single and multiple dose administration, Cycle 1 and 2: pre-dose, 0.5, 1 , 2, 3, 5, 8, 24, 48, 72, 168 and 336 hours after start of the infusion, Cycle 3 and 4: pre-dose and 1 hour after start of the infusion; each cycle is 21 days
Tumor response, Tumor response will be evaluated based on the RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) 1.1 criteria., Every 42 days|Biomarker (plasma), Cycle 1: pre-dose, 24 hours after start of the infusion and Day 15, Cycle 2, 3 and 4: pre-dose; each cycle is 21 days|Biomarker (biopsy), Additional cohort only, Cycle 1: pre-dose and Day 8; cycle 1 is 21 days|Immunogenicity, Analyzed for anti-BAY 1179470 antibodies, Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 pre-dose and every second cycle thereafter pre-dose. End of treatment visit and follow-up visit up to 2 years; each cycle is 21 days
