Investigation of the Proportion of Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 Protein Overexpression of Gastric Adenocarcinoma and Prognostic Effect of HER2, and Analysis of Practice Pattern of Herceptin Use in Stage IV Gastric Cancer
The objective of this study is to investigate the proportion of HER2 overexpression in gastric cancer patients group, to evaluate the relation of HER2 overexpression with prognosis, and to analyze the proportion of herceptin applied to patients in clinical field. Furthermore, the investigators are going to reevaluate the clinical benefit of Herceptin for survival prolongation compared to chemotherapy only.
Stomach Neoplasms
The proportion of HER2 overexpression in gastric cancer patients, 8 years
Gastric cancer specific survival according to HER2 expression in each stage, 5 years
The practice pattern of Herceptin use in stage IV gastric cancer, 3 years
