Combination of Nelmastobart and Capecitabine Therapy in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
This is an open-label clinical trial aimed at evaluating the safety and efficacy of the combination treatment of nelmastobart with capecitabine in patients diagnosed with metastatic or recurrent colorectal cancer.
Recurrent or Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Nelmastobart and Capecitabine
Maximum Tolerated Dose, The MTD was defined as the highest dose at which no dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was experienced by the first 3 patients in that cohort, or the dose at which a DLT was experienced by no more than 1 of 6 patients evaluable for toxicity., Up to approximately 2 years|Progression free survival, PFS events is defined as the interval from the first dose of investigational treatment to the earlier of the first documentation of objective progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause,whichever comes first., Up to approximately 2 years
Overall response rate, ORR is defined as the proportion of participants who achieve a CR or PR as assessed by RECIST v1.1., Up to approximately 2 years|Overall survival, Progression free survival (PFS) will be calculated from the first dose of investigational treatment until date of progression or death without progression, using the Kaplan-Meier method accompanied by determination of the median and its 95% confidence interval., Up to approximately 2 years
Colorectal cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in men and the second most common cancer in women worldwide, with an estimated 1.9 million new cases and 935,000 deaths in 2020, according to the World Health Organization. Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer typically undergo first-line treatment consisting of fluorouracil-based chemotherapy (oxaliplatin and irinotecan) with or without vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-based therapy (primarily bevacizumab), and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted therapies (in patients with RAS wild-type tumors). Second-line treatment options may include alternative chemotherapy regimens. Third-line treatment options are often limited for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, as they tend to exhibit poor objective response rates and short progression-free survival. However, despite their good performance status, patients often encounter limited options for third-line treatment, resulting in a daunting and frustrating situation.

This study will enroll patients aged â‰¥18 years who are resistant or intolerant to oxaliplatin and irinotecan-based chemotherapy. The study will evaluate the safety of the Nelmastobart and capecitabine combination therapy in Phase 1b. After identifying the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D), the study will assess the efficacy of the Nelmastobart and capecitabine combination therapy in Phase 2.
