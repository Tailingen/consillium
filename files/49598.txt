The trial is conducted as a multi-centre, open label, single-arm phase 1 first-in-human trial to evaluate NECVAX-NEO1, a personalized investigational oral cancer immunotherapeutic investigational medicinal product in n=15 patients with solid tumors under anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 monoclonal checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy.

The trial has been designed to assess safety and tolerability of NECVAX-NEO1, at two dose levels as well as efficacy signals of NECVAX-NEO1 and immuno- and biomarkers in tumor tissue and blood samples pre- and post treatment.

The trial will include patients with a diagnosis of either non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), melanoma, urothelial cancer, renal cell cancer (RCC), or squamous cell cancer of head and neck (SCCHN). Neoantigen epitopes as patient-individual tumor-specific drug targets will be selected and identified by the NEC OncoImmunity proprietary machine-learning and artificial intelligence technology.
