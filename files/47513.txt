Capecitabine Maintenance Therapy Following Capecitabine Combined With Docetaxel in Treatment of mBC
It is a phase III trial to explore the efficacy and safety of metronomic chemotherapy with Capecitabine versus intermittent Capecitabine as maintenance therapy following first-line Capecitabine plus Docetaxel chemotherapy in treatment of HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer(mBC).

Adverse events (AEs), Adverse events (AEs) and laboratory tests graded according to the NCI CTCAE (version 4.0), premature withdrawals and vital signs. Hand-foot syndrome and diarrhea will be specially interested.

Adverse events of special interest: hand-foot syndrome and diarrhea. The estimated HFS rate will be about 60% from intermittent Capecitabine vs about 10% from metronomic Capecitabine, diarrhea rate will be about 50% from intermittent Capecitabine vs about 10% from metronomic Capecitabine., up to 36 months|Overall survival (OS):, Time from randomization to death, up to 52 months|Overall Response rates (ORR), Defined as CR+PR, assessed based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) criteria. It will be evaluated in the initial treatment phase and the maintenance treatment phase., up to 36 months|Clinical Benefit rate (CBR), Defined as CR+PR+SD, assessed based on on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) criteria. It will be evaluated in the initial treatment phase and the maintenance treatment phase, up to 36 months|Time to Progression (TTP), Time from randomization to disease progression, up to 36 months|QoL, Using the EORTC quality of life questionnaire QLQ-C30, up to 36 months
