Cetuximab, Gemcitabine, and Oxaliplatin Followed By Surgery or External-Beam Radiation Therapy and Capecitabine in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced, Nonmetastatic Pancreatic Cancer That Cannot Be Removed By Surgery
RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, and capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Sometimes when chemotherapy is given, it does not stop the growth of tumor cells. The tumor is said to be resistant to chemotherapy. Giving cetuximab together with chemotherapy may reduce drug resistance and allow the tumor cells to be killed. Giving cetuximab and chemotherapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving cetuximab together with oxaliplatin and gemcitabine followed by surgery or external-beam radiation therapy and capecitabine works in treating patients with locally advanced, nonmetastatic pancreatic cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.
Pancreatic Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: cetuximab|DRUG: capecitabine|DRUG: oxaliplatin|PROCEDURE: conventional surgery|RADIATION: radiation therapy|DRUG: Gemcitabine
Progression-free Survival at 6 Months, up to 46 weeks after the start of study treatment
Number of Participants With Grade 3-4 Adverse Events Reported, from start of study treatment until end of study visit, about 30 weeks|Overall Survival, up to 46 weeks after the start of study treatment|Response Rate, defined as the total number of subjects whose best response is PR or CR., up to 46 weeks after the start of study treatment|Response Duration in Patients With at Least Partial Response to Treatment, up to 46 weeks after the start of study treatment|Determine the Biomarker Response of CA 19-9 to Therapy, from start up treatment to one year after end of treatment, up to 81 weeks
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine the progression-free survival rate in patients with unresectable, locally advanced, nonmetastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas treated with neoadjuvant therapy comprising cetuximab, gemcitabine hydrochloride, and oxaliplatin followed by either surgery or chemoradiotherapy comprising external-beam radiotherapy and capecitabine.

Secondary

* Determine the toxicity and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.
* Determine overall survival and progression-free survival.
* Determine the response rate in these patients.
* Determine the response duration (defined as the time from first observation response to the time of progressive disease) in patients who achieve at least a partial response to treatment.
* Determine the biomarker response of CA19-9.

OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

* Neoadjuvant therapy: Patients receive cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours on days 1 and 8, gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 100 minutes on day 1, and oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 2. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients are evaluated after completion of neoadjuvant therapy. Patients with metastatic disease are taken off study. Beginning within 4 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant therapy, patients with resectable disease proceed to surgical resection or chemoradiotherapy (by choice); patients with unresectable disease proceed to chemoradiotherapy.

* Surgery: Patients undergo surgical resection with the Whipple procedure.
* Chemoradiotherapy: Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily 5 days a week (on days 1-5) and undergo external-beam radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for 5Â½ weeks.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 42 patients will be accrued for this study.
