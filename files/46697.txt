Decade-Long Insights Into Transperineal Prostate Biopsy in a West China Population
Prostate cancer (PCa) remains one of the most prevalent malignancies affecting men globally. The disease spectrum of PCa ranges from indolent tumors, which may require minimal to no intervention, to aggressive, potentially lethal forms. The complexity of PCa underscores the critical need for precise diagnostics, as early and accurate detection is key to improving patient outcomes and tailoring appropriate treatment strategies. There have been remarkable advancements in biopsy technology. Significant strides in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), especially with the establishment of the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS), have substantially improved the accuracy of PCa detection. The combination of MRI with traditional biopsy methods, including MRI-targeted biopsy (MRI-TBx) and systematic biopsy (SBx), also marks a major advancement in the field.

Despite advances in PCa detection, the need for improving diagnostics and in-depth assessment of the latest PBx techniques through extensive, longitudinal studies remains critical. Besides, based on the world health organization (WHO) classification, PCa includes a range of pathological forms beyond the commonly known acinar adenocarcinoma. However, the prevalence and demographic distribution of non-adenocarcinoma types, as well as the characteristics of patients with these rarer forms, remain unclear. Leveraging PBx records spanning over 10 years and involving 10,038 cases, this study aims to shed light on temporal trends in PBx positivity, the evolving clinical profiles of PCa patients, and the differences in clinicopathological characteristics of PCa between Western and Asian populations.
