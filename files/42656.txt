A Phase III Study Evaluating Glofitamab in Combination With Gemcitabine + Oxaliplatin vs Rituximab in Combination With Gemcitabine + Oxaliplatin in Participants With Relapsed/Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma
This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of glofitamab in combination with gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin (Glofit-GemOx) compared with rituximab in combination with gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin (R-GemOx) in patients with R/R DLBCL.
