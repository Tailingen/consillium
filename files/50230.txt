To develop a prototype participant educational aid that can be used by participants to support informed decision making about MCED testing. The aims of the pilot project include the following:

1. Conduct focus groups to explore preferences and concerns about MCED testing among adults of screening age.
2. Based on salient themes from focus group discussion, develop and administer surveys to explore preferences and concerns about MCED testing among adults of screening age.
3. Using findings from the focus groups and surveys, develop prototype patient educational aids about MCED testing following a user-centered design strategy.
