Assessment of Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics With BAT4706 and BAT1308 in Advanced Solid Tumors Patients
This is a Phase 1, Multicenter, Open-label Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Preliminary Efficacy of BAT4706 Injection Combined With BAT1308 Injection in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: BAT4706 Injection|DRUG: BAT1308 Injection
Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), The following AEs related to the study drug occurred from day 1 to day 21 after administration in the first cycle:

≥grade 3 of non hematological toxicity (except for nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea that can be relieved within 3 days of supportive treatment, and those who recover within 2 hours of symptomatic treatment of infusion reactions); ≥grade 4 of Hematological toxicity(including ≥ 3 grade neutropenia with fever; however, grade 4 neutropenia requires a duration of ≥ 7 days to determine DLT);≥ grade 4 thrombocytopenia or grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding., The first administration cycle(21 days)|Vital signs, Number of cases with abnormal vital signs results, Through study completion, 1 year|Physical examination, Number of cases with abnormal physical examination results, Through study completion, 1 year|Laboratory Examination, Number of cases with abnormal laboratory examination results, Through study completion, 1 year|Electrocardiogram, Number of cases with abnormal electrocardiogram results, Through study completion, 1 year|Echocardiography, Number of cases with abnormal echocardiography results, Through study completion, 1 year|Adverse event, Number of cases with all adverse medical events that occur after the subject receives the investigational drug assessed by CTCAE V5.0, Through study completion, 1 year
Pharmacokinetic, Cmax, Every cycle until 18 cycles (one cycle equals 3 weeks)|Immunogenicity, Presence of anti drug antibody (ADA)/Neutralizing antibodies (NAb), Every cycle until 18 cycles (one cycle equals 3 weeks)|Objective response rate (ORR), Refer to the proportion of subjects defined as complete remission (CR) and partial remission (PR), Through study completion, 1 year|Best Overall Response Rate(BORR), The proportion of subjects with complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) as the optimal ORR in tumor efficacy evaluation, Through study completion, 1 year|Progression-Free Survival(PFS), The time from the first administration to the occurrence of objective tumor progression or all cause death, Through study completion, 1 year|Duration of Response(DOR), DoR is defined as the time between the first assessment of objective remission of a tumor and death from any cause before the first assessment of Disease progression (PD) , reflecting the duration of ORR., Through study completion, 1 year|Overall Survival(OS), The time from the date of first administration to the occurrence of death due to any cause. Subjects who were still alive at the time of analysis will use the date of their last contact as the deadline., Through study completion, 1 year
The goal of this interventional study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of BAT4706 injection combined with BAT1308 injection in patients with advanced solid tumors, explore the maximum tolerable dose. The study is generally divided into two stages. In the first stage, the "3+3" dose increasing rule is proposed to explore the safety and tolerability, subject will be given BAT1308 injection and BAT4706 injection through Intravenous infusion in the first four cycles, and then maintain administration of BAT1308 monotherapy after four cycles until 18 cycles; In the second stage, based on the preliminary safety and efficacy results of the previous stage, appropriate doses and tumor types were selected for extended research, in order to further explore the safety and clinical effectiveness of BAT4706 injection and BAT1308 injection in the combined administration mode.
