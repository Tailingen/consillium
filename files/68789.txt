Nanobody-Based CD19/CD22 Tandem Dual CAR-T Therapy for R/R B-ALL
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Nanobody-Based CD19/CD22 Tandem Dual Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy in patients with relapsed or refractory B-ALL
Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: Nanobody-Based CD19/CD22 Tandem Dual CAR-T
Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT), CRS and ICANS will be assessed per ASTCT (2019), while other AEs follow CTCAE v5.0. DLTs are CAR-T-related AEs (possibly, likely, or definitely related) that occur within 28 days post-infusion and meet the following criteria:

Grade 4+ CRS, or Grade 3 CRS unresolved to ≤ Grade 2 within 7 days. Grade 3+ non-hematologic toxicity unresolved to ≤ Grade 2 within 7 days. Grade 4+ ICANS, or Grade 3 ICANS unresolved to ≤ Grade 2 within 3 days. Grade 4+ hematologic toxicity (excluding lymphopenia) lasting \>28 days. Grade 3+ hypersensitivity reaction. Any unexpected toxicity requiring study discontinuation.

Exemptions:

Rapid hypersensitivity resolving to ≤ Grade 2 in 2 hours. Reversible Grade 3 AEs lasting ≤7 days. Transient CRS-related organ dysfunction, resolving in ≤7 days per SRC. All DLTs are reviewed by the Safety Review Committee., Day28 after CAR-T cell infusion|Overall Response Rate (ORR), Time Frame: Within 3 months after CAR-T cell infusion Definition: ORR is defined as the proportion of patients achieving complete remission (CR), complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi), or morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS), as per European LeukemiaNet (ELN) 2022 criteria.

Response Criteria (ELN 2022):

Complete Remission (CR):

\<5% bone marrow blasts Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.0 × 10⁹/L Platelet count ≥100 × 10⁹/L No evidence of extramedullary disease Full hematologic recovery

Complete Remission with Incomplete Hematologic Recovery (CRi):

\<5% bone marrow blasts ANC \<1.0 × 10⁹/L and/or platelet count \<100 × 10⁹/L No evidence of extramedullary disease

Morphologic Leukemia-Free State (MLFS):

\<5% bone marrow blasts No hematologic recovery required (ANC and platelet counts may remain low) No extramedullary leukemia, Within 3 months after CAR-T cell infusion
Disease-Free Survival (DFS), DFS is defined as the duration from the first confirmed complete remission (CR), complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi), or morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS) to the occurrence of:

Bone marrow relapse - defined as the recurrence of ≥5% blasts in the bone marrow.

Extramedullary relapse - defined as the recurrence of leukemia outside the bone marrow, such as in the central nervous system (CNS), lymph nodes, liver, spleen, or other organs.

Death from any cause, whichever occurs first., 2-year|Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the duration from the first CAR-T cell infusion to the date of death from any cause. Patients who are still alive at the time of analysis will be censored at their last known follow-up date., 2-year
This Phase I/II study aims to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of Nanobody-Based CD19/CD22 Tandem Dual CAR-T-cell therapy in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), particularly those who have failed or relapsed after CD19- or CD22-targeted CAR-T or antibody-based immunotherapy.

In the Phase I portion of the study, a 3+3 dose-escalation design will be employed to evaluate safety and determine the optimal dose of Nanobody-Based CD5 CAR-T cells. Three dose levels will be tested: 0.3 × 10⁶ cells/kg, 1.0 × 10⁶ cells/kg, and 2.0 × 10⁶ cells/kg. The recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) will be established based on safety data, dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), and preliminary efficacy outcomes.

The Phase II portion will then focus on evaluating the efficacy of Nanobody-Based CD19/CD22 Tandem Dual CAR-T therapy at the RP2D, with key endpoints including overall response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS). Safety assessments, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), will also be conducted throughout the study.

This study seeks to address the unmet clinical need for effective treatment options in patients with R/R B-ALL, particularly those who have exhausted prior CD19- or CD22-directed therapies.
