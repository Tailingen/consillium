LBH589 in Relapsed or Relapsed and Refractory Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia
The purpose of this research study is to assess the overall response rate of LBH589 in patients with relapsed or refractory Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia. LBH589 is a newly discovered compound that has killed Waldenstrom cells in laboratory studies, however, it is not known if LBH589 will show the same activity in people with Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia. This drug has been used in research for the treatment of other types of cancer, such as multiple myeloma.
Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia
DRUG: LBH589
Overall Response Rate, Overall response rate is percentage of participants with complete (CR), very good partial (VGPR), partial (PR), or minimal response (MR) as best response during treatment.

CR

* Disappearance of monoclonal protein by immunofixation
* No histologic evidence of bone marrow involvement
* Resolution of any adenopathy/organomegaly (confirmed by CT scan), or signs or symptoms attributable to WM.
* Second immunofixation required for confirmation.

VGPR

-At least 90% reduction of serum monoclonal IgM concentration on protein electrophoresis.

PR

* At least 50% reduction of serum monoclonal IgM concentration on protein electrophoresis and at least 50% decrease in adenopathy/organomegaly on physical examination or on CT scan.
* No new symptoms or signs of active disease.

MR

* At least 25% but less than 50% reduction of serum monoclonal IgM by protein electrophoresis.
* No new symptoms or signs of active disease., Assessed after 2nd cycle and then every subsequent cycle for 6 cycles. The median number of completed cycles of therapy was 5 (0- 32). As such observed up to ~32 months.
Median Progression Free Survival, Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from start of treatment to disease progression or death from any cause as estimated by Kaplan Meier methods. Patients who have not progressed and are alive are censored at the date the patient is known to be progression-free., Assessed after 2nd cycle and then every subsequent cycle for 6 cycles and then every 3 months. If taken off treatment at cycle 2 for disease progression, assessed every 3 months. The median (range) follow up from treatment start is 7.7 month (0.9 - 29.7).|Median Time to Progression, Time to progression (TTP) is defined as the time from start of treatment to progression. Patients who have not progressed are censored at the date the patient is last known to be progression free., Assessed after 2nd cycle and then every subsequent cycle for 6 cycles and then every 3 months. If taken off treatment at cycle 2 for disease progression, assessed every 3 months. The median (range) follow up from treatment start is 7.7 month (0.9 - 29.7).|Median Duration of Response, Duration of response DR is defined as the time from the date of first response after treatment to the date of disease progression Patients who have died for any cause or are alive without progression are censored at the date the patient is last know to be progression-free.

Duration of response DR is defined as the time from the date of first response after treatment to the date of disease progression or death for any cause. Patients who are alive without progression are censored at the date the patient is last know to be progression-free., Assessed after 2nd cycle and then every subsequent cycle for 6 cycles and then every 3 months. If taken off treatment at cycle 2 for disease progression, assessed every 3 months. The median (range) follow up from treatment start is 7.7 month (0.9 - 29.7).|Number of Participants With Grade 3 and 4 Treatment-Related Thrombocytopenia, Grade 3 thrombocytopenia is defined as having 25,000-50,000 /uL platelets

Grade 4 thrombocytopenia is defined as having \< 25,000 /uL platelets, Assessed after 2nd cycle, every subsequent cycle for 6 cycles and then every 3 months. Once off-treatment, adverse events will be assessed for 30 days. The median (range) number of completed cycles of therapy was 5 (0- 32). Therefore, up to ~33 months.|Acetylated Histone H3 and Overall Response Association, Acetylated-histone-H3 levels were obtained through bone marrow biopsies and measured using established methods. This analysis aimed to analyze the association between overall response and percent change of acetylated histone h3 in samples using a paired t-test., Bone marrow biopsies were obtained at the start of treatment (baseline) and after the 6th cycle.
This phase II study is designed to assess the toxicity profile and the proportion of overall response in patients with relapsed or refractory WM. This will study the effect of single agent LBH589 on response in these patients. Efficacy measures will include both objective clinical measurements and investigator-reported outcomes. Response and time to event analyses will follow the criteria set forth in the International Waldenstrom consortium recommendations. Prior to the start of the study, investigators will assess disease and perform a CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis.

Response will be assessed after 2 cycles. If patients have stable disease or response, then they will continue on therapy until progression or unacceptable toxicity, being assessed every cycle until the sixth cycle and then every 3 months. Patients who show progression after 2 cycles will come off therapy and undergo event monitoring every 3 months. All responses will be assessed by M-protein quantification and immunofixation from serum and IgM monoclonal protein level. In addition, BM biopsies will be done at baseline, at the end of cycle 6 and at the end of all therapy. The protocol was amended because of concerns of toxicity to allow a starting dose of 25 mg; 12/36 (33%) patients were enrolled on the 25 mg dose.
