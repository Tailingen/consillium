A Comparison of Aerobic and Resistance Exercise to Counteract Treatment Side Effects in Men With Prostate Cancer
Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men. Those in the intermediate/high-risk categories typically receive androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and radiotherapy. ADT greatly reduces androgen production as prostate cancer is dependent on testosterone and dihydrotestosterone for its growth.The side effects of ADT therapy are extensive and include changes in body composition (muscle loss, bone loss and fat gain), strength, mood, physical function, sexual function and increased cardiovascular risk and fatigue. Many of these side effects can be influenced by exercise training, both resistance training and aerobic training. However, the most appropriate exercise regime for men undergoing ADT has received little research attention.

General quality of life by questionnaire, The RAND 36-Item Health Survey comprises of 36 questions and assesses eight health concepts: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional well-being, social functioning, energy/fatigue, and general health perceptions. Scores range from 0-100. A higher score indicates a high quality of life and a favourable health status., At baseline, 8 weeks and 24 weeks (end of intervention)|Cancer Specific quality of life by questionnaire, The European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) comprises of 30 questions, categorised into five functioning scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain and nausea/vomiting) and one global health status scale. The remaining six single-item (dyspnoea, appetite loss, sleep disturbance, constipation, diarrhoea and the financial impact) scales assess symptoms.

Scores range from 0-100. A higher score for the functional scales and global health status indicates better functioning and quality of life. A higher score on the symptom and single-item scales denotes a high level of symptoms (i.e. a poor quality of life)., At baseline, 8 weeks and 24 weeks (end of intervention)|Prostate cancer specific quality of life by questionnaire, The European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-PR25) is a prostate cancer supplementary questionnaire module to be employed in conjunction with EORTC QLQ-C30.

Although many interventions for prostate survivors emphasise resistance exercise to maintain muscle mass and strength. Arguments could equally be made for programmes emphasising aerobic exercise for fatigue, anxiety, cardiovascular risk reduction and indeed overall survival.

Comparisons of programmes that emphasise each exercise mode are clearly required.

Therefore the overall purpose of this feasibility and pilot randomised control trial is to determine the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of an aerobic emphasised exercise program (AE) verses a resistance emphasise exercise program (RE) in a rehabilitation setting, over 6 months, for prostate cancer men undergoing Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT).
