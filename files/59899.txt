Ultra Hypofractionnated Radiotherapy With HDR Brachytherapy Boost.
Phase 1-2 study, comparing ultra-hypofractionnated (UH) to a moderately hypofractionnated (MH) radiation therapy, with image guided HDR prostate brachytherapy. Using iso-equivalent doses, a non-inferiority analysis will be done in order to prove UH non-inferior to MH, toxicity wise. Acceptability, tolerability, acute and late toxicity will be reported. MRI visible dominant intra-prostatic lesion will be outlines and variability between radiation oncologists and radiologists will be reported. As secondary objective, biochemical and clinical failure free survival will be reported at 5 \& 10 years.

* contrast media (gadolinium) is optional.

Physique

* Linac energy (between 6 MV to 18 MV).

* CBCT will be done at each fraction delivered.

Clinical and dosimetric data will be collected prior treatment.

Primary objectives :

* Toxicity analysis will be quantitatively evaluated using CTCAE (v5) at 1, 2 and 5 years post-therapy, and has needed at FU visits. Kaplan-Meier statistical analysis will be used to report toxicity evolution through time.
* median IPSS scores will be reported at 3, 6, 12 months and yearly (1, 2, 3, 4 et 5) post-therapy. IPSS median time to baseline return will be calculated.
* IPSS urinary scores, sexual function (SHIM) and GI toxicity (CTCAE-v5) and quality of life questionnaires ( EPIC-26) will be given at 3, 6 months and yearly thereafter (1, 2, 3, 4 et 5) post-treatment.

Secondary objectives : Biochemical disease-free survival has per Phoenix definition (by American Society of Radiation Oncology - ASTRO) recommendation will be reported using Kaplan-Meier analysis.
