Evaluate the Prognostic Significance of Changes in the Systemic Immune-Inflammation Index in Patients with AGC Treated with ICI Therapy.
The SIIR during neoadjuvant therapy can serve as a specific biomarker for predicting the efficacy of immunotherapy in patients with advanced gastric cancer.

A total of 410 patients with advanced gastric cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC group, 178) or immunotherapy (ICIs group, 232) were enrolled in two tertiary referral centers. The SIIR (\[SIIpost-treatment - SIIpre-treatment\] / SIIpre-treatment) was calculated. The diagnostic threshold for SIIR was set at the median value (-0.3) A joint model based on longitudinal trajectory and time-to-event analysis was used to assess the correlation between SIIR and the risk of death in patients with advanced gastric cancer.
