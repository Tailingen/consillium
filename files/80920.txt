A Study of GLB-002 in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas
Study GLB-002-01 is a first-in-human (FIH), phase 1, open-label, dose escalation and expansion clinical study, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and preliminary efficacy of GLB-002 monotherapy in participants with relapsed or refractory Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (R/R NHL).
Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
DRUG: GLB-002
Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLT), DLT is defined as the treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) meeting protocol specified DLT criteria and occurring within the DLT assessment period, except those that are clearly and incontrovertibly due to extraneous causes including disease progression, pre-existing medical condition that has not worsened from baseline, or other causes that are clearly not due to study drug., Up to 35 days after first dose of study treatment in Phase 1a|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), MTD is defined as the highest dose level at which no more than 1 of 6 DLT-evaluable participants experienced a DLT., Up to 2 years (each cycle is 28 days)|Recommended Expansion Doses (RED), RED will be decided by safety review committee (SRC) considering the data including safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and preliminary efficacy of GLB-002 in dose escalation. RED will be the dose level below MTD., Up to 2 years (each cycle is 28 days)|Incidence, Relatedness, Seriousness and Severity of Adverse Events (AEs), AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. AE will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for AE (NCI CTCAE) version 5.0., Up to 2 years|Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D), RP2D based on the totality of data across dosing cohorts in the dose escalation and expansion phases of the study including PK, PD, safety and efficacy outcomes., Up to 2 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percent of participants whose best overall response is complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). CR and PR will be assessed by 2014 Lugano for NHL and/or 2018 International Working Group Criteria for Chronic Lymphocyte Leukemia (2018 IWCLL)., Up to 2 years|Time to Response (TTR), For participants with objective response, TTR was defined as the time of participants from the first treatment administration to the first incidence of a confirmed CR or PR was reported. CR and PR will be assessed by 2014 Lugano for NHL and/or 2018 IWCLL., Up to 2 years|Duration of Remission or Response (DOR), For participants with objective response, DOR is measured from the time of any of CR or PR are first met (whichever is first recorded) until the first date at which progressive disease or death from any cause is objectively documented assessment. CR and PR will be assessed by 2014 Lugano for NHL and/or 2018 IWCLL., Up to 2 years|Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the first dose of GLB-002 to the first occurrence of progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause. PD will be assessed by 2014 Lugano for NHL and/or 2018 IWCLL., Up to 2 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the first dose of GLB-002 to death due to any cause., Up to 2 years
