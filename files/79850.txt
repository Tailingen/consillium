Efficacy and Safety of Everolimus in Combination Therapy, in Patients With HER2-overexpressing Metastatic Breast Cancer
Phase I: will look at different dose levels and regimens of everolimus combined with weekly trastuzumab and paclitaxel therapy in patients with HER-2 overexpressing metastatic breast cancer.

Phase II: will assess the efficacy and safety of the 10mg daily dose of everolimus combined with weekly trastuzumab and paclitaxel therapy in patients with HER-2 overexpressing metastatic breast cancer.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Everolimus|DRUG: Trastuzumab|DRUG: Paclitaxel
Phase II: Overall Response Rate, The primary objective of this phase II study was to evaluate the efficacy of the dose level/regimen of everolimus recommended from the Phase I with trastuzumab and paclitaxel (PT) therapy in patients with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer whose disease progressed on/after trastuzumab mono-and/or combination therapy based on the evaluation of objective response rate (ORR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Objective response rate (ORR) was defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). Only patients with measurable disease (the presence of at least one measurable lesion) at baseline were included in the study. CR = Disappearance of all target lesions; PR = At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of the longest diameters., every 8 - 9 weeks until disease progression or a new lesion is identified
Phase I: Best Overall Response (BOR), BOR was determined based on investigator assessment of overall lesion response using RECIST criteria guidelines. BOR = objective responses rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR) or clinical benefit rate (CBR). ORR = (complete response (CR) or partial response(PR); DCR = (CR or PR or Stable disease (SD); CBR = (CR or PR or SD \>= 24 weeks).CR = Disappearance of all target lesions; PR = At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of the longest diameters; SD = Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR or CR nor an increase in lesions which would qualify for partial disease (PD). PD = At least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of all measured target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of longest diameter of all target lesions recorded at or after baseline., every 8 - 9 weeks until disease progression or a new lesion is identified|Phase II: Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from start of treatment to the date of first documented progression or death due to any cause. If a patient has not had an event, PFS will be censored at the date of last adequate tumor assessment., every 8 - 9 weeks until disease progression or a new lesion is identified|Phase II: Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from start of treatment to the date of death due to any cause. If a patient is not known to have died, survival was censored at the last date of contact. OS was to be reported at extension and after 3-year follow-up. The Kaplan-Meier median was used to analyze the OS., every 3 months until death
