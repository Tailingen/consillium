SBRT Sequential CapeOX Regimen Combined With Bevacizumab and Sintilimab in First-line Treatment of mCRC
Immune checkpoint inhibitors have a poor effect on MSS colorectal cancer. Studies have shown that SBRT, chemotherapy and anti-vascular therapy can enhance the anti-tumor effect of PD-1 antibody. This is a prospective, single-arm study to explore the efficacy and safety of SBRT Sequential CapeOX Regimen Chemotherapy Combined With Bevacizumab and Sintilimab in treatment with patients with initially unresectable advanced colorectal cancer.
