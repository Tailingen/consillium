Discontinuation of CDK4/6 Inhibitors in Patients With Metastatic HR Positive, HER2 Negative Breast Cancer
This is a low-intervention, randomized, non-comparative, open-label, multicenter, prospective, phase II trial investigating discontinuation of CDK4/6 inhibitors in patients with metastatic HR positive, HER2 negative breast cancer with durable disease control.

The primary objective is to evaluate long-term disease stabilization of CDK4/6 inhibitors discontinuation after a prolonged treatment period with continued endocrine therapy in breast cancer patients exhibiting at least stable disease after at least 12 months of combination treatment.
