Change in Insulin Sensitivity Measures: Insulin Sensitivity Index (ISI), Insulin sensitivity as measured by a combination of insulin sensitivity index (ISI) which should go up after 3 month treatment period to show improvement, and insulin sensitivity (SI) which should go down after 3 month treatment period to show improvement. Note that the ISI as developed by Matsuda and DeFronzo from a calculation based on results from a standard oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (doi: 10.2337/diacare.22.9.1462 Diabetes Care September 1999 vol. 22 no. 9 1462-1470) is recorded as units on an arbitrary scale. SI data is based on a calculation derived from analysis of results of frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIVGTT) by Bergman et al (doi:10.1172/JCI112886/J Clin Invest. 1987;79(3):790-800) and is reported with units min-1/(µlU/L)., baseline and 3 months|Change in Insulin Sensitivity Measures: Insulin Sensitivity (SI), Insulin sensitivity as measured by a combination of insulin sensitivity index (ISI) which should go up after 3 month treatment period to show improvement, and insulin sensitivity (SI) which should go down after 3 month treatment period to show improvement.
