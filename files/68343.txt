BEZ235 Phase II Trial in Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors (pNET) After Failure of mTOR Inhibitor Therapy.
This is a Phase II study in 2 stages, evaluating BEZ235 plus best supportive care (BSC) versus placebo plus BSC in patients with advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET) after failure of mTOR inhibitor therapy.

Study design: This was a Phase II, two-stage, multicenter study, where Stage 1 was a single arm, open label design and Stage 2 was planned to be a randomized, double-blind study.

However, at the end of Stage 1, the futility was met and hence the Stage 2 was not initiated.
Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors (pNET)
DRUG: BEZ235 (Stage 1)
Stage 1 - Progression Free Survival (PFS) Rate Analysis at 16 Weeks as Per Local Radiology Review, PFS rate at 16 weeks was defined as a binary variable. Patients were considered as 'progression free' after 16 weeks if they had an overall lesion response of complete response (CR) partial response ('PR) or stable disease (SD)' and "progressed" if they had an overall lesion response of 'Progressive disease (PD) at the scan which occurred on day 105 after start of treatment, or later. Patients whose 16 weeks tumor assessment was unknown, missing or outside the window was not considered as 'progression free' and was considered a "failure" and counted only in the denominator for the estimation of the 16 week progression free rate., 16 weeks after the first BEZ235 administration.
Stage 1- Overall Response Rate (ORR), Overall Response rate was defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall response of complete response or partial response, based on investigator's assessment as per RECIST criteria version 1.1. Based on futility analysis conducted at the end of stage 1, stage 2 was not initiated., Baseline, every 8 weeks up to 31 months|Stage 1 - Disease Control Rate, Disease control rate was defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall response of Complete Response, Partial response, or Stable disease, based on the investigator's assessment per RECIST version 1.1. Based on futility analysis conducted at the end of stage 1, stage 2 was not initiated., Baseline, every 8 weeks up to 31 months
