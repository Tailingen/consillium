AA4500 (XIAFLEX™, Proposed Name) in the Treatment of Dupuytren's Contracture
This was a Phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study conducted in the United States. Subjects with a diagnosis of Dupuytren's contracture in a metacarpophalangeal (MP) or proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint that resulted in a fixed flexion deformity of at least one finger, other than the thumb, that was at least 20° as measured by finger goniometry and was suitable for injection were randomized 2:1 to receive AA4500 0.58 mg or placebo.

This study was designed to be part of the larger clinical program, for adult patients with Dupuytren's contracture with a palpable cord, where the data from 2 pivotal Placebo-Controlled studies (AUX-CC-857 (NCT00528606) and AUX-CC-859 (NCT00533273)) and 7 non-pivotal studies were evaluated.
Dupuytren's Contracture
BIOLOGICAL: collagenase clostridium histolyticum|BIOLOGICAL: Placebo
Clinical Success (Reduction in Contracture to 5° or Less) of the Primary Joint After the Last Injection, The Primary Outcome Measure for patients treated with AA4500 is the percentage of joints that were successfully treated where "successfully treated" was defined as reduction in contracture to within 0-5° of normal within 30 days of injection.

The Primary Outcome Measure for placebo treated patients is the percentage of joints that were successfully treated where "successfully treated" was defined as reduction in contracture to within 0-5° of normal within 30 days of injection., Within 30 days after the last injection
Clinical Improvement After the Last Injection, Clinical Improvement is defined as \>= 50% reduction from baseline in degree of contracture within 30 days of the injection., Baseline; within 30 days after the last injection|Percent Reduction From Baseline Contracture After the Last Injection, Percent change in degree of contracture measured as 100\* (baseline contracture - last available post-injection contracture)/baseline contracture., Baseline; within 30 days after the last injection|Change From Baseline Range of Motion After the Last Injection, Change in degree of motion measured as last available post-injection range of motion - baseline range of motion., Baselin; within 30 days after the last injection|Time to First Achieve Success After the Last Injection, Last evaluation visit on which clinical success is achieved through the Day 30 evaluation|Clinical Success (Reduction in Contracture to 5° or Less) After the First Injection, Clinical Success is defined as reduction in contracture to within 0-5 degrees of normal within 30 days of injection., Within 30 days after first injection|Clinical Improvement After the First Injection, Clinical Improvement is defined as \>= 50% reduction from contracture within 30 days of the first injectionor greater of baseline contracture within 30 days of the injection., Baseline; within 30 days after the first injection|Percent Reduction From Baseline Contracture After the First Injection, Percent change in degree of contracture measured as 100\* (baseline contracture - last available post-injection contracture)/baseline contracture., Baseline, within 30 days after the first injection|Change From Baseline Range of Motion After the First Injection, Change in degree of motion measured as last available post-injection range of motion - baseline range of motion., Baseline; within 30 days after the first injection
