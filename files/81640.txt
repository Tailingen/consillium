Phenylbutyrate in Treating Patients With Refractory Solid Tumors or Lymphoma
Phase I trial to study the effectivenes of phenylbutyrate in treating adults with refractory solid tumor or lymphoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.
Lymphoma|Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific
DRUG: chemotherapy|DRUG: oral sodium phenylbutyrate
OBJECTIVES:

I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of oral phenylbutyrate that can be given three times daily in patients with refractory solid tumors or lymphoma until disease progression or a trough plasma concentration of 2-6 micromoles per liter is achieved.

II. Characterize the pharmacokinetics of oral phenylbutyrate absorption, and determine whether there is time dependence in the systemic clearance rate during multiple dosing.

III. Seek preliminary evidence of therapeutic activity of phenylbutyrate when administered on this schedule in these patients.

IV. Correlate any observed responses and toxic effects with results of bioassays and tissue sampling for phenylbutyrate activity.

OUTLINE: This is a dose-seeking study.

All patients receive oral phenylbutyrate three times daily. Groups of 4 or more patients receive escalating doses of phenylbutyrate until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. Treatment continues until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity intervenes.
