Methotrexate or Pentostatin for Graft-versus-host Disease Prophylaxis in Risk-adapted Allogeneic Bone Marrow Transplantation for Hematologic Malignancies
The purpose of the study is to determine if participants who receive the GVHD prophylaxis medication pentostatin will have less severe hepatic toxicities than those receiving MTX. The study is estimated to have sufficient statistical power to ascertain at least a 20% improvement in day 42 NCI CTC grade 2 or above hepatic toxicity-free survival in pentostatin recipients.

Determining Whether the Hepatic Adverse Event-free (NCI Grades II-IV) Survival at Day 42 After an HLA-matched Transplant for Hematologic Malignancy Can be Improved by Using a GVHD Prophylaxis Regimen That Includes Pentostatin Rather Than MTX., The hypothesis was that individuals receiving the drug pentostatin as GVHD prophylaxis would experience less severe hepatic toxicity than those receiving methotrexate as GVHD prophylaxis. The study is estimated to have sufficient statistical power to ascertain at least a 20% improvement in day 42 grade 2 or above hepatic toxicity-free survival in pentostatin recipients, 42 days post-transplant
Assess Overall Survival, Relapse, Engraftment, and Regimen-related Morbidity and Estimating Cumulative Incidence of Pulmonary Adverse Events and Mucositis., To characterize the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships of pentostatin in this patient population and to assess the relationship between pre-transplant minimal residual disease (MRD) and transplant outcomes., 42 days post- transplant
Participants will be randomized to receive either methotrexate (MTX) or pentostatin for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis after receiving an allogeneic bone marrow transplant from an HLA-matched related or unrelated donor. All participants will receive a standard backbone GVHD prophylaxis regimen (tacrolimus and sirolimus) and conditioning (cyclophosphamide/TBI). A risk-adapted approach will be used during conditioning to further minimize the risk of leukemia relapse based on two factors:

1. Lymphoid versus myeloid primary disease.
2. KIR compatibility between donor and host.
