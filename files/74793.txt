Pembrolizumab +/- SD-101 in Hormone-Na√Øve Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer With RT and iADT
This is a non-comparative open-label multicenter Phase 2 clinical trial combining stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and pembrolizumab with or without intratumoral SD-101 in patients with newly diagnosed hormone-naive oligometastatic prostate cancer.
Prostatic Neoplasms
DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: SD-101|DRUG: Leuprolide acetate|DRUG: Abiraterone Acetate|DRUG: Prednisone|RADIATION: Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy
Change Rate of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) < nadir + 2 ng/mL from first day of treatment to 15 months (Cohort 2), Only patients in cohort 2, who achieve testosterone recovery to non-castrate levels (\>150 ng/dL) at 15 months, will be analyzed for the primary endpoint. The rate of PSA \< nadir + 2 ng/mL at 15 months from the start of radiotherapy and cycle 1, day 1 of pembrolizumab, among patients whose testosterone recovers to non-castrate levels (\>150 ng/dL). The point estimate of the rate of PSA \< nadir + 2 ng/mL will be obtained with its 95% confidence interval for participants by arm in cohort 2 and compared to the historical control rate by one sample binomial test. All patients who receive any part of a dose of RT, SD-101 or pembrolizumab will be analyzed for efficacy, Start of treatment and 15 months (approx. 15 months total)|Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events, Adverse events occurring on study will be summarized for all participants that received study intervention (including pembrolizumab, SD-101, SBRT to prostate, SBRT to oligometastatic sites) by maximum toxicity grade for each study arm., Up to 15 months
Rate of testosterone-PSA uncoupling (Cohort 2), Testosterone-PSA uncoupling is defined as PSA \< 50% baseline and \< 20ng/mL for at least 3 months after testosterone recovers to \>150 ng/dL. In patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer off hormonal therapy, \>90% patients are expected to have PSA increase to \> 50% baseline after 3 months of testosterone recovery. Therefore, the presence of PSA testosterone uncoupling in this study may serve as a surrogate of immunotherapeutic responses induced by pembrolizumab combined with RT (arm 1), or RT with SD-101 (arm 2), if a prolonged PSA \< nadir + 2 ng/mL is not achieved. The point estimate of testosterone-PSA uncoupling rate will be obtained with its 95% confidence interval for each arm in cohort 2., Up to 15 months|Time to clinical progression (Cohort 2), The time to clinical progression in each study arm in cohort 2 is defined as the time to radiographic progression by Prostate Specific Antigen Working Group-2 (PSAWG2) criteria, time to symptomatic progressive disease, or PSA progression, whichever comes the first. Kaplan-Meier estimate will be obtained for the time to clinical progression in each study arm in cohort 2, Up to 3 years|Progression-free survival (PFS) (Cohort 2), Progression-free survival (PFS) will be estimated for each study arm on cohort 2 by Kaplan-Meier estimate, where PFS is a composite endpoint based on PSA progression, radiological progression, clinical deterioration, or death, Up to 3 years
This randomized phase II trial studies how well androgen deprivation therapy, pembrolizumab, and stereotactic body radiation therapy with or without toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist SD-101 in treating patients with prostate cancer and cancer in all oligometastatic sites that has spread to other places in the body. Androgen can cause the growth of tumor cells. Androgen deprivation therapy, such as leuprolide acetate, prednisone, and abiraterone acetate may lessen the amount of androgen made by the body. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a specialized radiation therapy that sends x-rays directly to the tumor using smaller doses over several days and may cause less damage to normal tissue. Colony-stimulating factors, such as TLR9 agonist SD-101, may increase the production of blood cells. It is not yet known whether giving androgen deprivation therapy, pembrolizumab, and stereotactic body radiation therapy with or without TLR9 agonist SD-101 may work better in treating patients with prostate cancer and cancer in all oligometastatic sites.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES

* Cohort 1

  --To assess the safety associated with giving RT and pembrolizumab with or without intratumoral SD-101.
* Cohort 2

  * To continue to assess the safety associated with giving RT and pembrolizumab with or without intratumoral SD-101.
  * To assess if the rate of PSA \< nadir + 2 ng/mL at 15 months in patients with non-castrate levels of testosterone is greater than the historical control in each study arm.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

* To determine the rate of testosterone-PSA uncoupling in each study arm in cohort 2. Testosterone-PSA uncoupling is defined as PSA \< 50% baseline and \< 20ng/mL for at least 3 months after testosterone recovers to \>150 ng/dL. In patients with metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer off hormonal therapy, \>90% patient are expected to have PSA increase to \> 50% baseline after 3 months of testosterone recovery.
* To estimate time to clinical progression
* To estimate progression-free survival (PFS) in each study arm

EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE

* To assess peripheral and tumor-based biomarkers of response and resistance in both cohorts.
* To define the treatment-induced effects on circulating immune cells in both cohorts.
* To explore remodeling of circulating T cell repertoire in both cohorts.
* To explore the concordance of Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) - Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanning with conventional imaging in oligometastatic prostate cancer patients in both cohorts.
