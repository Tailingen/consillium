PROSABI: Prospective Multi-centre Study of Prognostic Factors in mCRPC Patients Treated With Abiraterone Acetate.
PROSABI is a prospective multicentre observational study in metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC), designed to explore prognostic biomarkers in patients undergoing treatment with abiraterone
Advanced Prostate Cancer|Abiraterone ACetate
To validate the independent prognostic value of the gene-expression signature from peripheral blood described by Olmos et al (Lancet Oncol 2012) on overall survival of mCRPC patients, Initially 48 months, currently 60 months
To analyze the prognostic value of the gene-expression signature described by Olmos et al on biochemical and radiological progression-free survival, Initially 48 months, currently 60 months|To analyze the prognostic value of early changes in the gene-expression signature described by Olmos et al, Initially 48 months, currently 60 months|To compare the prognostic value of the gene-expression signature described by Olmos et al versus the gene-expression signature described by Ross et al (Lancet Oncol, 2012), Initially 48 months, currently 60 months|To validate the prognostic value of classical nomograms designed to assess the outcomes of mCRPC patients in these patients, Initially 48 months, currently 60 months|To analyze the prognostic value of TMPRSS2-ERG rearrengement and PTEN loss in these cohorts, Initially 48 months, currently 60 months|To analyze the prognostic value of AR splicing variants, serum chromogranine and serum testosterone levels measured by ultrasensitive method in these both cohorts of patients, Initially 48 months, currently 60 months|To correlate the presence of somatic and/or germinal mutations with the outcomes of these patients, Initially 48 months, currently 60 months
This study is a prospective biomarker study of patients with mCRPC undergoing treatment with abiraterone as standard of care treatment. The participants will undergo serial pre- and post-therapy blood collection for biomarker analysis as part of the primary objective of the study.
