VITAS: Atezolizumab in Combination With Chemotherapy for Pediatric Relapsed/Refractory Solid Tumors
This trial is a multi-center, non-randomized, open-label Phase I/II study evaluating the feasibility and efficacy of vincristine, irinotecan, temozolomide, and atezolizumab in children with relapsed/refractory solid tumors.
Solid Tumor|Rhabdomyosarcoma
DRUG: Atezolizumab|DRUG: Vincristine|DRUG: Irinotecan|DRUG: Temozolomide
Number of participants with Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs), DLT is defined as any event that is possibly, probably, or definitely attributable to the treatment regimen and exceeds the protocol defined threshold for severity, Beginning of cycle 3, or 30 days after the second cycle has started, whichever is earlier (each cycle is 21 days)|Number of participants with Acute Adverse Events (AEs), AE is defined as any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human research study participant, including any abnormal sign, symptom, clinical event, or disease, temporally associated with the subject's participation in the research, whether or not it is considered related to the subject's participation in the research.

AEs will be graded by a numerical score according to the defined NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 5.0. Adverse events not specifically defined in the NCI CTCAE will be scored on the Adverse Event log according to the general guidelines provided by the NCI CTCAE. Acute AEs are events occurring in the time period from the signing of the informed consent, through 42 days post treatment., 42 days post treatment.|Number of participants with Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), SAEs are those events, occurring at any dose, which meets any of the following criteria: 1) results in death, 2) is life-threatening, 3) results in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, 4) results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, 5) results in a congenital anomly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to the IMP; or 6) based upon appropriate medical judgement, may jeopardize the subject's health and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this definition. SAE determination does not require the event to be related to the research.

SAEs will be graded by a numerical score according to the defined NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 5.0. Serious adverse events not specifically defined in the NCI CTCAE will be scored on the Adverse Event log according to the general guidelines provided by the NCI CTCAE., 48 months|Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is the percentage of participants whose confirmed best overall response was either a partial response (PR) or a complete response (CR) based upon independent review and per RECIST v1.1, modified INRC, or RANO criteria as appropriate., Up to 18 weeks post treatment|Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is the percentage of participants whose confirmed best overall response was either a partial response (PR) or a complete response (CR) based upon independent review and per RECIST v1.1, modified INRC, or RANO criteria as appropriate., Week 18 up to 24 months post treatment|Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is the percentage of participants whose confirmed best overall response was either a partial response (PR) or a complete response (CR) based upon independent review and per RECIST v1.1, modified INRC, or RANO criteria as appropriate., Month 24 up to end of study (approximately 48 months)
Duration of response, Measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started), Up to 18 weeks post treatment|Duration of response, Measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started), Week 18 up to 24 months post treatment|Duration of response, Measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started), Month 24 up to end of study (approximately 48 months)|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the interval between the first day of treatment and the date of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started)., Up to 18 weeks post treatment|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the interval between the first day of treatment and the date of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started)., Week 18 up to 24 months post treatment|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the interval between the first day of treatment and the date of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started)., Month 24 up to end of study (approximately 48 months)|Overall survival (OS), OS will be characterized as both the percentage of participants without event (death) as well as median time to event (death), Up to 18 weeks post treatment|Overall survival (OS), OS will be characterized as both the percentage of participants without event (death) as well as median time to event (death), Week 18 up to 24 months post treatment|Overall survival (OS), OS will be characterized as both the percentage of participants without event (death) as well as median time to event (death), Month 24 up to end of study (approximately 48 months)
In this study, we will test the combination of atezolizumab with chemotherapy for relapsed solid tumors in childhood. The combination of vincristine, irinotecan, temozolomide, and atezolizumab has not been tested. Thus, the trial will have two sequential cohorts: (1) a feasibility cohort, and (2) a rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) efficacy cohort. In the first cohort, we will determine the feasibility of administering vincristine, irinotecan, temozolomide, and atezolizumab simultaneously in children with relapsed or refractory solid tumors, regardless of histology or PD-L1 status. We will accrue 6 patients and will determine that the therapy is feasible if no more than 2 patients develop a dose-limiting toxicity. Provided that we meet our primary safety endpoint in the feasibility cohort, we will next accrue patients in the RMS efficacy cohort. We will accrue 17 patients in the RMS efficacy cohort. Patients in the feasibility cohort with RMS will be included in this number.

We will determine the objective response rate, duration of response, and progression-free survival for all children with relapsed or refractory solid tumors treated with vincristine, irinotecan, temozolomide, and atezolizumab.
