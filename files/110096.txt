Irinotecan Liposome (II) or Etoposide Combined With Adebrelimab and Carboplatin in the Treatment of ES-SCLC
This study is a prospective, randomized, parallel, multicenter phase II study aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of irinotecan liposome (II) or etoposide combined with adebrelimab and carboplatin as first-line treatment for extensive stage small cell lung cancer. The primary endpoint of the study was the 1-year overall survival rate.
