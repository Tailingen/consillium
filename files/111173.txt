A Study of the Efficacy and Safety of RO7198457 in Combination With Atezolizumab Versus Atezolizumab Alone Following Adjuvant Platinum-Doublet Chemotherapy in Participants Who Are ctDNA Positive After Surgical Resection of Stage II-III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity and biomarkers of RO7198457 plus atezolizumab compared with atezolizumab alone in patients with Stage II-III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who are circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) positive following surgical resection and have received standard-of-care adjuvant platinum-doublet chemotherapy.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
DRUG: Atezolizumab|DRUG: RO7198457
Disease-free Survival (DFS), DFS as assessed by the investigator, is defined as the time from randomization to the date of first documented recurrence of NSCLC or occurrence of new primary NSCLC or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 62 months
Percentage of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious AEs (SAEs) determined according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 5.0 (NCI CTCAE v5.0), Up to 90 days after the final dose of study drug or until initiation of another systemic anti-cancer therapy (up to approximately 62 months)|Plasma Concentrations of RNA at Specified Timepoints, Arm B: Days 1, 8, 15, 22 of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days), Day 1 of Cycle 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 and treatment discontinuation (TD) visit (up to 12 months)|Plasma Concentrations of (R)-N,N,N-trimethyl-2,3-dioleyloxy-1-propanaminium chloride (DOTMA) at Specified Timepoints, Arm B: Days 1, 8, 15, 22 of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days), Day 1 of Cycle 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 and treatment discontinuation (TD) visit (up to 12 months)|Maximum Serum Concentration (Cmax) of Atezolizumab at Specified Timepoints, Arm A and Arm B: Day 1 of Cycles 1-4 (each cycle is 28 days) and at TD visit (up to 12 months)|Minimum Serum Concentration (Cmin) of Atezolizumab at Specified Timepoints, Arm A and Arm B: Day 1 of Cycles 1-4 (each cycle is 28 days) and at TD visit (up to 12 months)|Change from Baseline in Number of Participants With Anti-drug Antibodies (ADA) to Atezolizumab, Arm A and Arm B: Baseline, Day 1 of Cycles 1-4 (each cycle is 28 days) and at TD visit (up to 12 months)
This study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity and biomarkers of RO7198457 plus atezolizumab compared with atezolizumab alone in patients with Stage II-III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who are circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) positive following surgical resection and have received standard-of-care adjuvant platinum-doublet chemotherapy.
