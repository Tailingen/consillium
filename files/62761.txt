This study is aimed to investigate the effect of zinc supplementation on improving regorafenib treatment safety and efficacy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). The difference in grade 2 or worse hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) incidence within the first 8 weeks of regorafenib treatment between two arms will be examined as the primary objective.
