Toxicity & Pharmacokinetics of 2 & 3-weekly Docetaxel in Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer (mHSPC)
This study is designed to investigate the toxicity and pharmacokinetics (PK) of 2-weekly and 3-weekly docetaxel in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC). Also, a mechanism-based population pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) model will be developed to provide a better understanding of the complex relationships between the drug exposure and toxicity profiles of docetaxel in mHSPC.

AUC0-inf = AUClast + Cllast/Kel Where Clast is the observed concentration at the last time point and Kel is the slope of the terminal linear portion of the log concentration-time curve., 0, 0.25, 0.75, 3, 6.5, and 24 hours post first docetaxel infusion; and, at the end of docetaxel infusion of the last cycle (a cycle is 2 weeks for the 2-weekly regimen, 3 weeks for the 3-weekly regimen)|Comparison of all grades of neutropenia (including febrile neutropenia) and other toxicities between the 2-weekly docetaxel dosing regimen and the 3-weekly docetaxel dosing regimen in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer., Adverse event data and corresponding toxicity grades during the days of treatment will be summarized for each docetaxel dosing arm. Neutropenia rates will be estimated along with exact 90% one-sided binomial confidence intervals. Incidence, frequency, severity, and attribution tables for other toxicities will be generated., up to 12 months after the first docetaxel dose|Development of a population system pharmacology model to describe the relationships between the PK (drug exposure) and PD (toxicity) of 2-weekly docetaxel in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, The mechanism population PK/PD model will be developed using Monte-Carlo Expectation-Maximization algorithm implemented S-ADAPT software (version 1.57, BMSR, Log Angeles, CA)., CBC with differential and platelet will be collected: 24-hour +/- 3hrs; and 7 days +/- 1day after the first administration of 2-weekly docetaxel in cycle 1 to support the development of population PK/PD model|Development of a population system pharmacology model to describe the relationships between the PK (drug exposure) and PD (toxicity) of 3-weekly docetaxel in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, The mechanism population PK/PD model will be developed using Monte-Carlo Expectation-Maximization algorithm implemented S-ADAPT software (version 1.57, BMSR, Log Angeles, CA)., CBC with differential and platelet will be collected: 24-hour +/- 3hrs; 7 days +/- 1day; and 14 days +/- 1day after the first administration of 3-weekly docetaxel in cycle 1 to support the development of population PK/PD model|Evaluation of the rate of complete serological response at 12 months, Defined as a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of less than 0.2 ng/mL, 12 months post treatment|Evaluation of the cytokine profile before and after treatment at different docetaxel dosage regimens, Descriptive statistics will be calculated for each cytokine parameter measured at each time point for each docetaxel dosing regimen and comparison from pre vs post-treatment within each arm will be performed using paired t-test while comparisons of cytokine parameters between docetaxel dosing groups will likewise be performed using two-sample t-test. Several cytokine parameters are evaluated and we will employ the Holm's p-value adjustment method to account for multiple testing between dosing group arms., Baseline before chemotherapy; immediately prior to second dose (cycle length depends on dosing regimen) of chemotherapy; 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy at Week 7, and at Week 19; at Month 12 after start of first docetaxel dose.
This pilot study is designed to investigate the toxicity and PK of 2-weekly and 3-weekly docetaxel in mHSPC. Furthermore, a mechanism-based population PK/ pharmacodynamics (PD) model will be developed to provide a better understanding of the complex relationships between the drug exposure and toxicity profiles of docetaxel in mHSPC. In addition, selected pro-inflammatory and macrophage-associated cytokines will be collected to assess the potential role of these cytokines as the early markers of docetaxel resistance in patients with mHSPC. (Cytokines: macrophage inhibitory cytokine 1 (MIC1), interleukin (IL)-1ra, IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, IL-12, and IFNγ). Serological response, defined as a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of \<0.2 ng/mL at 12 months, and progression-free survival at 12 months are selected as the secondary clinical endpoints of the study.
