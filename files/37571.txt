Robotic, Laparoscopic and Open Gastrectomy Compared on Short and Long Term Outcomes
The overall purpose is to develop and maintain a multi-institutional database comprising of information regarding surgical, clinical and oncological features of patients that will be treated for gastric cancer with robotic, laparoscopic or open approaches and subsequent follow-up.

The main objective is to compare the three surgical arms on surgical and clinical outcomes, as well as on the oncological follow-up.
Gastric Cancer
PROCEDURE: Robotic Gastrectomy|PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic Gastrectomy
Rate of patients with intraoperative adverse events, events other than the normal course of the surgery, During surgery|Mean of retrieved lymph nodes, Count of retrieved lymph nodes at the histopathological examination of the surgical specimen, Within 30 days after surgery|Rate of patients alive, subjects alive at the planned endpoint, 1 year after surgery|Rate of patients alive, subjects alive at the planned endpoint, 2 year after surgery|Rate of patients alive, subjects alive at the planned endpoint, 3 year after surgery|Rate of patients alive, subjects alive at the planned endpoint, 4 year after surgery|Rate of patients alive, subjects alive at the planned endpoint, 5 year after surgery
Mean post-operative hospital stay, hospital stay of the patients after surgery, from the day after surgery to patient discharge, assessed up to 90 days|Rate of complications after discharge, any surgical related event after patient's discharge, 5 year after surgery
A review of the scientific literature, which was recently published by the IMIGASTRIC study group, aimed to perform a more complete analysis of the current situation regarding performing minimally invasive surgery for gastric cancer. Significant limitations were found in the analyzed studies, including:

* Small samples of patients, mostly low-quality comparative studies
* Selection bias in the comparison groups (e.g. stage, extent of lymphadenectomy)
* Absence of subgroup analysis in significant research fields
* Lack of information on the surgical techniques adopted

A large prospective multicenter registry could thus be the optimal way to clarify the role of minimally invasive surgery for gastric cancer and permit the evaluation of its short and long-term effects. A working basis for analyzing outcomes of interest and obtaining directions for guidelines and future study developments can also be created. The following would be the main advantages of a large prospective multicenter registry:

* Achieving a large sample of patients
* Collecting multiple variables, allowing for the making of a comprehensive statistical report
* Standardizing the methodology to be adopted, thus increasing accuracy
* Bringing together the experiences of both East and West to discover shared points A prospective registry can become a powerful tool that can guide research in this field to new developments and pave the way for other investigational opportunities.
