Determination of the Feasibility of Tumoural Somatic Mutations Detection in Blood of Patients With Ovarian Cancer
BOVARY-Pilot is a monocentric prospective transversal pilot study with a total duration of 6 months. The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of detecting somatic tumor mutations in the blood of patients with ovarian cancer in order to determine whether a blood test can replace a tissue biopsy to prescribe a personalized treatment. The method will consist of a single blood sample during the patient's visit and prior to the establishment of any newly diagnosed cancer treatment. The concordance of somatic mutations (SNV) found in tissue and in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) extracted from blood will then be compared
Ovarian Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: HRD and BRCA mutations
Concordance between DNA extracted from tumour tissue and cfDNA extracted from plasma (SNV, indels), Number of patients with detected punctual somatic mutations (SNVs and indels of BRCA1/2 and genes involved in HRD) concordance between DNA extracted from tumour tissue and cfDNA extracted from plasma, 1 day (samples will be analyzed in batch at the end of inclusions)
Concordance between DNA extracted from tumour tissue and cfDNA extracted from plasma (large rearrangements, LOH, CNV), Number of patients with detected genomic alterations (large rearrangements, LOH and CNV of BRCA1/2 and genes involved in HRD) concordance between DNA extracted from tumour tissue and cfDNA extracted from plasma, 1 day (samples will be analyzed in batch at the end of inclusions)
