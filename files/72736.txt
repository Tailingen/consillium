Guadecitabine (SGI-110) vs Treatment Choice in Adults With MDS or CMML Previously Treated With HMAs
A Phase 3, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, multicenter study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of guadecitabine in participants with MDS or CMML who failed or relapsed after adequate prior treatment with azacitidine, decitabine, or both. This global study will be conducted in approximately 15 countries. Approximately 408 participants from approximately 100 study centers will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to either guadecitabine (approximately 272 participants) or Treatment Choice (approximately 136 participants). The study consists of a 21-day screening period, a treatment period, a safety follow-up visit, and a long-term follow-up period. The study is expected to last more than 2 years, and the duration of individual participant participation will vary. Participants may continue to receive treatment for as long as they continue to benefit.

Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the number of days from the day the participant was randomized to the date of death due to any cause. Survival time was censored on the last date the participant is known alive with no event of death. OS time will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method., From randomization up to death (up to approximately 38.6 months)
Percentage of Participants With Transfusion Independence for Any 8 Consecutive Weeks, Transfusion independence rate was calculated as the number of participants with neither RBC nor platelet transfusion for any period of 8 weeks after the initiation of treatment (or cycle 1 day 1 { C1D1} visit date for participants randomized to BSC or randomization date for participants not treated) and up to treatment discontinuation (or 180 days for participants discontinuing the treatment within 6 months), while maintaining haemoglobin (Hgb) ≥8 gram per deciliter (g/dL) and platelets ≥20×10\^9/liter (L) divided by the total number of participants included in the efficacy analysis. RBC or Platelet transfusion independence rate was defined similarly as above. Percentage of participants are rounded off to the single decimal point., Up to approximately 46.6 months|Percentage of Participants With Marrow Complete Response (mCR) Along With Transfusion Independence Rate, mCR was defined as per 2006 Myelodysplastic Syndromes International Council for Harmonisation (MDS IWG) criteria as reduction of bone marrow (BM) blasts to ≤5% and decrease by 50% or more with or without normalization of peripheral counts. Transfusion independence rate was calculated as the number of participants with neither RBC nor platelet transfusion for any period of 8 weeks after the initiation of treatment (or C1D1 visit date for participants randomized to BSC or randomization date for participants not treated) and up to treatment discontinuation (or 180 days for participants discontinuing the treatment within 6 months), while maintaining Hgb ≥8 g/dL and platelets ≥20×10\^9/L divided by the total number of participants included in the efficacy analysis. The percentage of participants who achieved mCR and transfusion independence simultaneously in the same period were calculated for each group. Percentage of participants are rounded off to the single decimal point., Up to approximately 46.6 months|Survival Rate at 1 Year After Randomization, One year survival rate was defined as the percentage of participants that survived at the end of the first year from randomization. Participants who did not have death in record were censored on the last date known to be alive. Percentage of participants are rounded off to the nearest whole number., From randomization up to 12 months|Leukemia-free Survival, Leukemia-free survival was defined as the number of days from randomization to the earliest date when participants have bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood (PB) blasts ≥20%, conversion to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or death of any cause. Participants with no events in leukemia-free survival were censored on the last date of BM or PB blasts assessment, whichever is later. Survival time will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method., From randomization up to 46.6 months|Number of Days Alive and Out of the Hospital (NDAOH), The date of each hospital admission and discharge was collected for each participant for up to 6 months, unless the participant died or withdrew consent prior to that time. Duration of each hospital stay in days was calculated as date of discharge minus date of admission. The NDAOH within first 6 month period was calculated as: NDAOH 6M=180 -total duration of all hospital stays within 180 days from the first treatment -number of death days before Day 180. For participants who were lost to follow-up within 6 months, the NDAOH was calculated conservatively assuming that the participant would have died the day after the last contact day., Up to 6 months|Disease Response (DR) Rate, DR: Complete Response(CR), Partial Response(PR),Marrow Complete Response(mCR), and Hematological Improvement(HI) including HI with Erythroid (HI-E), HI with Neutrophil (HI-N), or HI with Platelet (HI-P) based on IWG 2006 criteria. CR: BM:≤5% myeloblasts, Peripheral blood: Hgb≥11g/dL, Platelets(PLTs)≥100x10\^9/L, Neutrophils≥1.0x10\^9/L, Blasts 0%.

HI responses:1) HI-E: Hgb increase ≥1.5g/dL, Relevant reduction of RBC units transfusions by absolute ≥4 RBC transfusions/8 week(wk) compared with pretreatment transfusion number previous 8wk. Only RBC transfusions given for Hgb≤9.0g/dL. 2) HI-P: Absolute increase≥30x10\^9/L starting\>20x10\^9/L PLTs; Increase from\<20x10\^9/L to\>20x10\^9/L and by≥100%. 3) HI-N: ≥100% increase, absolute increase\>0.5x10\^9/L., Up to approximately 46.6 months|Duration of Complete Response (CR), Duration of complete response (in number of days) was calculated from the first time a CR was observed to the date of the earliest of the following three events: 1) relapse/disease progression, 2) start of alternative therapy (except Hematopoietic Cell Transplant \[HCT\]) or 3) death. In the absence of any event, the duration of CR was censored at the last available time point (BM assessment, PB assessment, or safety/long-term follow-up visit) at which an event was not observed. Duration of complete response was analysed using a Kaplan-Meier method for participants who achieved a CR during the study. CR: BM: ≤5% myeloblasts (all cell lines normal maturation), Peripheral blood: Hgb ≥11g/dL, PLTs ≥100x10\^9/L, Neutrophils ≥1.0x10\^9/L, Blasts 0%., Up to approximately 46.6 months|Time to First Response, Complete Response (CR) and Best Response, Time to first response was the time(days) from randomization to first date when any response was achieved. Time to CR was the time(days) from randomization to first date when CR was achieved. Time to best response was the time(days) from randomization to first date when participant's best response (CR,PR,mCR or HI) was achieved. CR:BM:≤5% myeloblasts, Peripheral blood:Hgb≥11g/dL,PLTs≥100x10\^9/L,Neutrophils≥1.0x10\^9/L,Blasts 0%.

One RBC or platelet transfusion was defined as one unit, and a single bag of RBCs or platelets was considered one unit. The mean total number of RBC or platelet units transfused per participant is presented., Up to 6 months|Change From Baseline in Health-related Quality of Life (QOL) By EuroQol 5-level 5-dimension (EQ-5D-5L) Summary Index, The EQ-5D-5L is a self-reported health status questionnaire that consists of six questions used to calculate a health utility score for use in health economic analysis. There are two components to the EQ-5D-5L, first component is a descriptive system five-item health state profile that assesses mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression used to obtain an Index Utility Score, as well as a second component visual analogue scale (VAS) that measures health state. Each dimension comprises 5 levels with corresponding numeric scores, where 1 indicates no problems, and 5 indicates extreme problems. The health status is converted to an index value using the country-specific weighted scoring algorithm for England. The summary index value for the England ranges from a worst score of -0.281 to a best score of 1. An increase in the EQ-5D-5L total score indicates improvement., Baseline to Month 6|Change From Baseline in Health-related QOL: EuroQOL Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS) Score, The EQ-5D-5L is a self-reported health status questionnaire that consists of six questions used to calculate a health utility score for use in health economic analysis. The second component, EQ VAS self-rating records the respondent's own assessment of his/her overall health status at time of completion, on a scale of 0 (worst health you can imagine) to 100 (best health you can imagine)., Baseline to Month 6|Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participants administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An SAE is defined any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death; is life-threatening; requires inpatient hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability; is congenital anomaly; is suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal product or is medically important. Treatment emergent AEs which are those with onset date on or after the date of the first dose of study drug on C1D1 until 30 days after the last dose of study treatment, or the start of an alternative anticancer treatment, whichever occurs first., From first dose through end of study (up to approximately 46.6 months)|30-day and 60-day All-cause Mortality, Number of deaths, regardless of cause, within 30 or 60 days from the first study dose divided by the total number of participants included in the Safety Analysis Set. Participants who died within 30 days were also included in the 60-day mortality calculations., From first dose until 60 days after study treatment initiation
Multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group study of guadecitabine vs Treatment Choice (TC). Approximately 408 participants will be randomly assigned 2:1 to either guadecitabine or TC.

* Guadecitabine: approximately 272 participants.
* TC: approximately 136 participants.

Before randomization, the investigator will assign each participant to one of the following TC options:

* Low dose cytarabine (LDAC).
* Standard Intensive Chemotherapy (IC) of a 7+3 regimen.
* Best Supportive Care (BSC) only. BSC will be provided to all participants as per standard and institutional practice. Participants randomized to TC will not be allowed to cross over to guadecitabine. Data will be reviewed by an independent Data Monitoring Committee at regular intervals, primarily to evaluate safety during study conduct. Randomization will be stratified by disease category (MDS vs CMML), bone marrow (BM) blasts (BM blasts \>10% vs BM blasts ≤10%), TC option (LDAC vs IC vs BSC), and study center region.

Guadecitabine: 60 milligrams per square meter (mg/m\^2) given subcutaneously (SC) daily on Days 1-5 in 28-day cycles (delayed as needed to allow blood count recovery). Treatment should be given for at least 6 total cycles in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression requiring alternative therapy. Beyond 6 cycles, treatment should continue as long as the participant continues to benefit. BSC should be given according to standard and institutional practice.

Treatment Choice (TC): Before randomization, the investigator will assign each participant to one of the following TC options:

* Low dose cytarabine (LDAC) given as 20 mg/m\^2 SC or intravenously (IV) once daily for 14 days in 28-day cycles (delayed as needed to allow blood count recovery). Treatment should be given for at least 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
* Standard Intensive Chemotherapy (IC) of a 7+3 regimen: given as cytarabine 100-200 mg/m\^2/day given as continuous infusion for 7 days and an anthracycline given as per institutional standard practice such as daunorubicin (45-60 mg/m\^2/day), or idarubicin (9-12 mg/m\^2/day), or mitoxantrone (8-12 mg/m\^2/day) by intravenous infusion for 3 days.
* Best Supportive Care (BSC) only: given according to standard and institutional practice. BSC includes, but is not limited to blood transfusions (Red blood cells \[RBCs\] or platelets), growth factors including erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESA), granulocyte stimulating factors (GSFs), iron chelating therapy, and broad-spectrum antibiotics and/or antifungals.
