Outcomes of Resection at Different Times Between the End of Neoadjuvant Treatment and Surgery
Neoadjuvant radio-chemotherapy (NRCT) represents a milestone in the treatment of selected rectal tumours. Ideal time interval between the end of NRCT and surgery is still debated; a 6-8 weeks time interval is considered optimal, but shorter or longer intervals have been associated with better oncological outcomes. Moreover, there is a lack of data about clinical postoperative outcomes and different time intervals after the end of NRCT. Here, effect that different time intervals have on postoperative complications with particular regard to the anastomotic dehiscence have been evaluated.

Methods One hundred-sixty-seven patients underwent surgery after long-course NRCT. Three different time intervals were considered: (0-42; 43-56; \>57 days).

Neoadjuvant radio-chemotherapy (NRCT) represents a milestone in the treatment of selected rectal adenocarcinoma. Even though a 6-8 weeks' time interval after the end of NRCT and surgery is considered ideal, the optimal time for surgery is still controversial.
