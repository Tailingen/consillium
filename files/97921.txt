UCDCC#270: Avelumab and Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy in Non-responding and Progressing NSCLC Patients
This is a pilot, single center, open-label study to examine the ORR, safety, and toxicity of avelumab in combination with SAR in non-responding and progressing NSCLC patients previously treated with a PD-1 Inhibitor.
Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
DRUG: Avelumab|RADIATION: Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SAR)
Overall Response Rate, Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1). Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria., Up to 90 days after completion of study treatment
Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the duration of time from the start of treatment to death from any cause., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 90 days after completion of study treatment.|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 90 days after completion of study treatment.|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of patients that achieve an objective tumor response or stable disease to therapy., From date of randomization to end of study, assessed up to 90 days follow-up|Duration of Stable Disease, SD is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria for disease progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started., From date of randomization to end of study, assessed up to 90 days follow-up|Duration of Overall Response, The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever status is recorded first) until the first date that recurrence or PD is objectively documented, taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started., From date of randomization to end of study, assessed up to 90 days follow-up|Confirmation, The main goal of confirmation of objective response is to avoid overestimating the response rate observed. In cases where confirmation of response is not feasible, it should be made clear when reporting the outcome of such studies that the responses are not confirmed., From date of randomization to end of study, assessed up to 90 days follow-up|Immune Related Response Criteria, A growing body of literature indicates that radiographic responses to immunotherapy may have different patterns and kinetics than what would be expected with traditional cytotoxic therapies. To account for these differences we will also characterize radiographic outcomes using the immune related response criteria outlined by Wolchok and colleagues as an exploratory outcomes., From date of randomization to end of study, assessed up to 90 days follow-up|Evaluation of Best Overall Response, The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). In general, the patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria., From date of randomization to end of study, assessed up to 90 days follow-up
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. More than half of lung cancer patients present with metastatic disease at diagnosis, with a median survival of only 10-12 months. In recent years the development of more efficacious therapies for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) based upon an improved understanding of the underlying tumor biology has resulted in an improvement in median overall survival by several months. However, survival remains poor for most patients and there remains an urgent unmet need for novel treatment strategies to improve survival for these patients.

Avelumab is a fully human anti-PD-L1 IgG1 monoclonal antibody. In phase I studies, avelumab was well-tolerated at a dose of 10 mg/kg IV Q2 weeks with the most frequently observed treatment related adverse events including fatigue, infusion-related reactions, nausea, chills, diarrhea, and pyrexia. However, many patients will not respond to checkpoint inhibition, and developing strategies to further improve the efficacy and extend the benefit of these treatments to non-responding and progressing patients is an area of substantial need. Among NSCLC patients, approximately 80% of patients will not respond to a checkpoint inhibitor as monotherapy.

Combinatorial strategies may increase response rates. Radiotherapy is an intriguing partner therapy, with preclinical and clinical studies confirming the immunomodulatory effects of radiotherapy. There is particularly interest in the use of radiotherapy in patients who have failed a checkpoint inhibitor as monotherapy as this approach will isolate the effects of radiation in enhancing response rates.

Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SAR) (also known as stereotactic body radiotherapy or SBRT) has emerged as a potentially curative treatment option for patients with early stage, medically inoperable non-small cell lung cancer and as a safe and effective local treatment for metastatic lesions.

The investigators hypothesize that local radiotherapy can augment the systemic effects of avelumab in NSCLC patients previously refractory to a checkpoint inhibitor previously used as standard-of-care treatment. This proposal seeks to gain insight into the clinical and biological efficacy of this combination.
