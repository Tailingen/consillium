A Study of HMBD-002, a Monoclonal Antibody Targeting VISTA, as Monotherapy and Combined With Pembrolizumab, in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a phase 1/2, open-label, multi-center, first-in-human, two-stage (Part 1: dose escalation and Part 2: dose expansion) study evaluating multiple doses and schedules of intravenously (IV) administered HMBD-002, with or without pembrolizumab KEYTRUDA®, in patients with advanced solid tumors (i.e., locally advanced and unresectable, or metastatic).

Dose-limiting Toxicity, The incidence of DLTs during the DLT assessment period., First 21 days of treatment.|Dose-Finding, Determination of the MTD or maximum tested dose, and the RP2D., Screening to 90 days from last dose.|Frequency and Severity of Adverse Events (AE), The incidences and percentages of patients experiencing AEs summarized by NCI CTCAE version 5.0 grade and by causality., Screening to 90 days from last dose.
Pharmacokinetics of HMBD-002, Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Day 1 of dosing through 21 days post last dose.|Pharmacokinetics of HMBD-002, Area Under the Curve (AUC), Day 1 of dosing through 21 days post last dose.|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR according to RECIST v1.1., Day 1 of dosing through every 90 after the last dose.|Duration of Response (DoR), Time from the date measurement criteria are first met for PR or CR to the date measurement criteria are first met for PD., Day 1 of dosing through every 90 after the last dose.|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Time from the date of initiation of study therapy to the date measurement criteria are first met for PD or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Day 1 of dosing through every 90 after the last dose.|Overall Survival (OS), Time from the date of initiation of study therapy to the date of death from any cause., Day 1 of dosing through every 90 after the last dose.
This is a phase 1/2, open-label, multi-center study whose principal phase 1 stage objective is to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the anti-VISTA monoclonal antibody (mAb) as a single agent and combined with the anti-PD-1 mAb pembrolizumab KEYTRUDA® in subjects with advanced solid malignancies.

In the phase 2 stage, the antitumor activity of HMBD-002 alone or combined with pembrolizumab KEYTRUDA® will be evaluated in patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and a wide range of other malignancies known or documented to express VISTA.
