An English/Spanish Mobile Augmented Reality Pain Assessment App for Hispanic/Latino Pediatric Cancer Patients
In this SBIR, ALTality, Inc. ("SpellBound") will assess the feasibility of a dual English/Spanish language augmented reality(AR)-enabled tool for assessing inpatient postoperative pain/nausea/vomiting in Hispanic/Latino children and adolescents with cancer in collaboration with bilingual Spanish-speaking anesthesiologists at the MD Anderson Cancer Center. If successful, the AR app will be an immediately implementable and commercially viable method of providing Hispanic/Latino pediatric cancer patients with limited English proficiency an adjunctive tool to overcome infrastructural barriers to receiving translation services in acute care settings that put them at higher risk of under and/or overtreatment of pain by prescription opioids and future prescription opioid dependency and misuse, at no cost to them or their families.
