Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of Multiple Immunotherapy-Based Treatments and Combinations in Patients With Urothelial Carcinoma (MORPHEUS-UC)
A Phase Ib/II, open-label, multicenter, randomized, umbrella study in participants with MIBC and in participants with locally advanced or metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma (UC) who have progressed during or following a platinum-containing regimen. The study is designed with the flexibility to open new treatment arms as new treatments become available, close existing treatment arms that demonstrate minimal clinical activity or unacceptable toxicity, or modify the participant population (e.g., with regard to prior anti-cancer treatment or biomarker status). Participants in the mUC Cohort who experience loss of clinical benefit or unacceptable toxicity during Stage 1 may be eligible to continue treatment with a different treatment regimen for Stage 2.
