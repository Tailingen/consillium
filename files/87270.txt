QUILT-3.013: Study of Ad5 [E1-, E2b-]-HER2/Neu Vaccine (ETBX-021) in Subjects With Unresectable Locally Advanced or Metastatic HER2-Expressing Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine whether ETBX-021 is safe and effective in the treatment of unresectable locally advanced or metastatic HER2-low-expressing breast cancer.
Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: ETBX-021
Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events, Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Serious Adverse Events, and Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), Up to 12 months|Determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) or Highest Tested Dose (HTD), Up to 11 months
ORR (Confirmed Complete or Partial Response), ORR assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1., Up to 11 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Confirmed response or stable disease lasting for at least 6 months according to RECIST V1.1, Up to 11 months|Duration of Response, The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrence or PD is objectively documented (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started)., Up to 11 months|Progression Disease Survival, PFS was defined as the time from the date of first treatment to the date of disease progression or death (any cause) whichever occurred first., Up to 2 years|Overall Survival, OS will be defined as the time from the date of first treatment to the date of death (any cause)., Up to 2 years
This is a Phase I trial in subjects with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic HER2-low expressing (IHC 1+ or 2+) breast cancer. The study will be conducted in two parts: the first part will involve dose escalation using a 3 + 3 design, and the second part will involve the expansion of the MTD or HTD to further evaluate safety, preliminary efficacy, and immunogenicity. In the first part, 3 to 6 subjects will be sequentially enrolled starting at dose cohort 1. Subjects will be assessed for dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs).
