Outcomes of a Novel Technique Minimal Scar Mastectomy
Nipple sparing mastectomy is oncologically safe and has a good cosmetic outcome. However, nipple sparing mastectomy was conventionally performed with reconstruction. Minimal scar mastectomy (MSM) is a novel technique which could allow women, with non-ptotic breasts, who do not want reconstruction, to conserve their nipple areolar complex (NAC) and avoid the transverse scar associated with modified radical mastectomy. This is the first study on the oncologic and surgical outcomes of MSM.
