Therapy for Children With Advanced Stage Neuroblastoma
Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumor in childhood, with nearly 50% of patients presenting with widespread metastatic disease. The current treatment for this group of high-risk patients includes intensive multi-agent chemotherapy (induction) followed by myeloablative therapy with stem-cell rescue (consolidation) and then treatment of minimal residual disease (MRD) with isotretinoin. Recently a new standard of care was established by enhancing the treatment of MRD with the addition of a monoclonal antibody (ch14.18) which targets a tumor-associated antigen, the disialoganglioside GD2, which is uniformly expressed by neuroblasts. Despite improvement in 2-year event-free survival (EFS) of 20%, more than one-third of children with high-risk neuroblastoma (HR defined in) still cannot be cured by this approach. Therefore, novel therapeutic approaches are needed for this subset of patients. This study will be a pilot Phase II study of a unique anti-disialoganglioside (anti-GD2) monoclonal antibody (mAb) called hu14.18K322A, given with induction chemotherapy.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

* To study the efficacy \[response: complete remission + partial remission (CR+PR)\] to two initial courses of cyclophosphamide and topotecan combined with hu14.18K322A (4 doses/course followed by GM-CSF) in previously untreated children with high-risk neuroblastoma.
* To estimate the event-free survival of patients with newly diagnosed high-risk neuroblastoma treated with the addition of hu14.18K322A to treatment.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

* To study the feasibility of delivering hu14.18K322A to 6 cycles induction chemotherapy and describe the antitumor activity (CR+PR) of this 6 course induction therapy.
* To estimate local control and pattern of failure associated with focal intensity modulated or proton beam radiation therapy dose delivery in high-risk abdominal neuroblastoma.
* To describe the tolerability of four doses of hu14.18K322A with allogeneic natural killer (NK) cells from an acceptable parent, in the immediate post-transplant period \[day +2 - +5 after peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) infusion\] in consenting participants.
* To describe the tolerability of hu14.18K322A with interleukin-2 and GM-CSF as treatment for minimal residual disease (MRD).

Overall Response Rate [Complete Response + Very Good Partial Response + Partial Response (CR + VGPR + PR)], Per the 1993 INRC: measurable tumor defined as product of the longest x widest perpendicular diameter, elevated catecholamine levels and tumor cels in bone marrow. Complete Response (CR)-no evidence of primary tumor or metastases. Very Good Partial Response (VGPR)-\>90% reduction of primary tumor; no metastases; no new bone lesions, all pre-existing lesions improved. Partial Response (PR)-50-90% reduction of primary tumor; \>50% reduction in measurable sites of metastases; 0-1 bone marrow samples with tumor; number of positive bone sites decreased by \>50%. Mixed Response (MR)-\>50% reduction of any measurable lesion with \<50% reduction in other sites; no new lesions; \<25% increase in any existing lesion. No Response (NR)-no new lesions; \<50% reduction but \<25% increase in an any existing lesion. No Response (NR)-no new lesions; \<50% reduction but \<25% increase in any existing legions. Progressive Disease (PD)-any new/increased measurable lesion by \>25%; previous negative marrow positive., After two initial courses of chemotherapy (approximately 6 weeks after enrollment)|Event-free Survival (EFS), EFS was estimated as time to relapse, progressive disease, secondary neoplasm, or death from any cause from enrollment. The EFS was estimated by Kaplan-Meier method, 3 years, from time of enrollment
Feasibility of Delivering hu14.18K322A to 6 Cycles of Induction Therapy, The study is designed to monitor the feasibility of delivering hu14.18K332A to 6 cycles of Induction chemotherapy. The feasibility of Induction therapy for this study will be to target no worse than 75%. A patient was considered as a "failure" for the 6 cycles of Induction therapy if the patient failed to complete Induction therapy within 155 days since treatment initiation due to toxicity or disease progression, unless the delay was a result of non-medical issues (e.g. not due to protocol toxicity). The proportion of patients who successfully received hu14.18K322A with 6 cycles of induction chemotherapy was estimated together with a 95% confidence interval. The response rate (CR + VGPR + PR) to 6 cycles of Induction chemoimmunotherapy was estimated together with the 95% confidence intervals, After 6 cycles of induction therapy (approximately 24 weeks after enrollment)|Local Failure Rate and Pattern of Failure, Local failure is defined as relapse or progression of disease at the primary site. The cumulative incidence of local failure will be estimated; competing events will include distant failure or death prior to local failure., Up to 3 years|Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) or Severe (Grade 3 or 4) VOD With hu14.18K322A With Allogeneic NK Cells in Consolidation, Number of patients who experience an unacceptable dose limiting toxicity (per CTCAE v 4.0) including the following toxicities: 1) toxicity requiring the use of pressors, including Grade 4 acute capillary leak syndrome or Grade3 and 4 hypotension; 2) Toxicity requiring ventilation support, including Grade 4 respiratory toxicity; 3) Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity with MRI evidence of new CNS thrombi, infarction or bleeding in any subject receiving the hu14.18K322A with NK cell combination; 4) Failure of recovery of ANC \> 500/mm3 by day 35 after PBSC infusion. Number of patients who experience Grade 3 or Grade 4 (per Common Toxicity Criteria v 4.0) veno occlusive disease (VOD)., During the recovery phase after busulfan/melphalan and PBSC rescue (approximately 24-26 weeks after enrollment)|Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), Number of patients who experience an unacceptable dose limiting toxicity (per CTCAE v 4.0) including the following toxicities: 1) Toxicity requiring the use of pressors, including Grade 4 acute capillary leak syndrome or Grade 3 and 4 hypotension; 2) Toxicity requiring ventilation support, including Grade 4 respiratory toxicity; 3) Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity with MRI evidence of new CNS thrombi, infarction or bleeding., During MRD treatment cycle (approximately 8-12 months after enrollment)
The phases of the study are:

1. Screening phase: Tests and evaluations will be done before treatment starts.
2. Induction phase: Includes chemotherapy plus hu14.18K322A mAb. Participants will also have surgery during this part of the study to remove as much tumor as possible.
3. Consolidation/Intensification phase: Includes high doses of chemotherapy and blood stem cell transplantation with additional, experimental "minimal residual disease" (MRD) treatment. Participants will also get radiation treatment to all sites of the tumor(s) after recovery from the stem cell transplant.
4. Maintenance/MRD treatment phase: With immune therapy in addition to the standard treatment with the drug isotretinoin.
