To assess the effects of i.v. Zometa® (zoledronic acid) 4 mg, with respect to the following efficacy parameters as well as safety and tolerability:|Effects on pain and analgesic drug consumption, assessed by the composite pain score from BPI (Brief Pain Inventory) for pain and by analgesic score|Time to first event of bone pain|Time to first occurrence of Skeletal Related Events (SREs), defined as pathologic bone fractures, spinal cord compression, surgery to bone, radiation therapy to bone (including the use of radioisotopes)|Proportion of patients in each arm having SRE|Serum PSA|Overall safety
