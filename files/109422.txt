Patient Characteristics, Treatment Patterns, and Healthcare Resource Utilization of Metastatic Melanoma Patients
This was a retrospective, non-interventional, registry study based on secondary electronic medical record (EMR) data collected in Helsinki and Uusimaa hospital district (HUS data lake), hospital district of Southwest Finland (VSSHP data lake) and Pirkanmaa hospital district (PSHP data lake) as a part of their routine clinical practice. Social Insurance Institution of Finland (SII; reimbursed drug purchases) was utilized in this study to complement the medication data. The metastatic melanoma patients were stratified by first-line treatment and by hospital district.
