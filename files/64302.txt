Treatment With Indinavir and Chemotherapy for Advanced Classical Kaposi's Sarcoma
The purpose of this study is to determine the clinical response to daily Indinavir oral administration in association with a conventional chemotherapy based on cycles of systemic Vinblastine +/- Bleomycin in patients affected by advanced classical (non HIV-associated) Kaposi's sarcoma
Kaposi's Sarcoma
DRUG: Indinavir in association with Vinblastina +/- Bleomicina
to determine the rate of complete responses at the end of treatment (including the maintenance phase) and of clinical responses after the maintenance phase, considering the residual debulked tumour (after the induction phase) as the reference point.
to determine time to tumor progression, treatment tolerability, indinavir pharmacokinetic profile, biological markers of response (ie. angiogenesis and immunoactivation parameters, HHV8 viral load and immune response)
It has been recently demonstrated that HIV protease inhibitors (HIV-PI) exert direct anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor actions by blocking endothelial and tumor cell invasion and matrix metalloprotease (MMP) activity. Based on this data, we have started a phase II trial for the treatment of HIV-negative patients with CKS with the HIV-PI Indinavir. Indinavir was well tolerated and induced KS regression/improvement in early-stage disease, and prolonged stabilization in late-stage KS. Response required high plasma drug concentrations indicating a "therapeutic" drug threshold, and was associated with a decrease of circulating endothelial cells (CEC), basic fibroblast growth factor and MMP2 plasma levels. However, large, confluent tumor masses were generally not responsive (Monini et al, AIDS 2009). Thus, advanced KS may benefit at best by treatment with IND upon tumor debulking by conventional chemotherapy.
