A Multi-Center Randomised Controlled Study to Evaluate Laparoscopic Versus Open Surgery for Colorectal Cancer
Laparoscopic surgery has been widely accepted for its minimal invasion and safety. However, whether it has the same survival benefit as the traditional open surgery in Chinese population is still unknown. So we designed this study to evaluate the 3 year disease free survival rate in the laparoscopic group versus the open surgery group.
