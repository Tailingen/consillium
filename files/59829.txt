Pemetrexed Plus Gemcitabine in Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients After Receiving Taxane Therapy
The purpose of the study is to determine if the two drugs can help patients feel better while causing the tumor to become smaller or disappear; evaluate the safety of giving both pemetrexed and gemcitabine in patients with advanced breast cancer.

DRUG: Pemetrexed|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Pemetrexed
Overall Tumor Response, Best overall (confirmed) response recorded from start of treatment until disease progression/recurrence, start of other anti-tumor therapy/intervention, or end of trial, whichever comes first. Response must be confirmed at least 6 weeks from previous scans. Best overall response assignment depends on both measurement and confirmation criteria., Every 6 weeks from start of treatment until documented disease progression or for 6 months from last dose of study drug, whichever occurs first. After 6 months, clinical assessment every 12 weeks and radiologic test performed as clinically indicated
Duration of (Confirmed) Complete Response or Partial Response, Duration of response is calculated as (Date of First Disease Progression or Death as a Result of any Cause whichever Comes First - Date of First Objective Status Assessment of Confirmed CR or PR + 1)/(365.25/12)., Every 6 weeks from start of treatment until documented disease progression or for 6 months from last dose of study drug, whichever occurs first. After 6 months, clinical assessment every 12 weeks and radiologic test performed as clinically indicated|Time to Progressive Disease, Time to progressive disease is calculated as (Date of First Disease Progression or Death Due to Disease under Study whichever Comes First - First Dose Date + 1)/(365.25/12)., Every 6 weeks from start of treatment until documented disease progression or for 6 months from last dose of study drug, whichever occurs first. After 6 months, clinical assessment every 12 weeks and radiologic test performed as clinically indicated|Time to Treatment Failure, Time to treatment failure is calculated as (Date of First Disease Progression, Death as a Result of any Cause, or Early Discontinuation of Treatment Due to Adverse Event or Physician Perception of Lack of Efficacy or Patient and Physician Perception of Lack of Efficacy, whichever Comes First - First Dose Date + 1)/ (365.25/12), Every 6 weeks from start of treatment until documented disease progression or for 6 months from last dose of study drug, whichever occurs first. After 6 months, clinical assessment every 12 weeks and radiologic test performed as clinically indicated|Overall Survival, Overall survival time is calculated as (Date of Death as a Result of any Cause - First Dose Date + 1)/ (365.25/12)., Every 6 weeks from start of treatment until documented disease progression or for 6 months from last dose of study drug, whichever occurs first. After 6 months, clinical assessment every 12 weeks and radiologic test performed as clinically indicated
