A Study of TY-9591 With Chemotherapy as 1st Line Treatment in Patients With Mutated Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor NSCLC
This study was a parallel, randomized, multicenter phase II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TY-9591 combined with platinum-based chemotherapy as first-line treatment in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer harboring EGFR sensitive mutations.
NSCLC
DRUG: TY-9591 80mg QD+pemetrexed+Cisplatin/Carboplatin|DRUG: TY-9591 160mg QD+pemetrexed+Cisplatin/Carboplatin
ORR, Defined as the proportion of subjects with an optimal response of CR or PR observed throughout the study from the start of randomization until first disease progression, Up to 33 months
PFS, It was defined as the time from the start of randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurred first, Up to 45 months|DoR, It was defined as the time during study treatment from the first assessment of a tumor as CR or PR to the first assessment of PD or death from any cause, whichever occurred first, Up to 45 months|DCR, The optimal response observed throughout the study from randomization to first disease progression was the proportion of subjects with CR or PR or SD (duration â‰¥6 weeks), Up to 33 months|OS, It was defined as the time from the start of randomization to death from any cause, Up to 45 months
Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either cohort 1 or cohort 2 for 21-day treatment cycles until disease progression (RECIST v1.1 criteria), treatment discontinuation criteria, withdrawal criteria, or study discontinuation, whichever occurred first. After the subjects terminate or withdraw from this study, the investigators can use reasonable follow-up treatment according to the subjects' condition.
