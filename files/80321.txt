Phase II Trial of EP4 Receptor Antagonist, AAT-007 (RQ-07; CJ-023,423) in Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a phase II trial of (RQ-07) in advanced solid tumors in prostate, breast or non-small cell lung cancer.
Prostate Cancer|Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer|Breast Cancer
DRUG: RQ-00000007|DRUG: Gemcitabine
Circulating Tumor Cells (CTC), The efficacy of the treatment drug will be assessed by the reduction of the number of CTCs. Blood sample collection will be done to assess CTCs., Day 21
Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cell (MDSC), The efficacy of the treatment drug RQ-07 will be assessed as a single agent and in combination with gemcitabine in breast cancer and lung cancer patients only. MDSC evaluation will be done via a blood sample collection, Day 21
This is a phase II trial of (RQ-07) in advanced solid tumors in advanced prostate, breast or lung cancer. The purpose of this trial is to determine whether the administration of the study drug RQ-07 can decrease circulating tumor cells in advanced prostate, breast or lung cancer. Additionally, the study will evaluate whether the study drug may improve outcome in advanced prostate, breast or lungs cancer either by itself or when combined with gemcitabine, a standard chemotherapy drug. The combination of with gemcitabine will only be investigated after disease has worsened with the study drug RQ-07 by itself and only in patients with prostate or lung cancer.
