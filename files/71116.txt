Comparison of Frailty Screening Performance and Predictive Validity of Adverse Health Outcomes in Breast Cancer Patients Using Frailty Screening Tools
This study uses the Physical Frailty Phenotype (PFP) as the diagnostic criterion for frailty and aims to explore the frailty screening scale FRAIL (The FRAIL Scale), Tilburg Frailty Index (TFI) and geriatric screening. Screening performance of Tool-8 (Geriatric-8, G-8) in breast cancer patients, to compare the predictive validity of different frailty screening scales for adverse health outcomes in breast cancer patients, and to select appropriate frailty screening methods for breast cancer patients in my country Screening scale.
Frailty Syndrome
Falls, one or more falls due to various reasons between the diagnosis of breast cancer and the second follow-up period.Does not use any scale, is a dichotomous variable with a fall score of "1" and a no fall score of "0"., From 2023.8~2025.12.|Unplanned hospitalisation, hospitalisation after doctor's diagnosis and hospitalisation for more than one day after diagnosis of breast cancer up to the second follow-up period, except for treatment nodes such as surgery and chemotherapy.No scale is used, it is a dichotomous variable with a score of "1" for unplanned hospitalisation and a score of "0" for non-occurrence., 2023.8~2025.12.|Disability, Activities of daily living (ADL) were assessed using the Barthel Index (BI).The present study defined the development of disability as a decrease in scores on at least one scale entry in the BI scale from six months earlier, From 2023.8~2025.12.|Depression, Depression screening was performed using the Geriatric Depression Scales-5 (GDS-5). The options for each entry were "yes" or "no". Entry 1 was scored 0 points for "yes" and 1 point for "no", and entries 2 to 5 were scored 1 point for "yes" and 0 points for "no". The answer "yes" for entries 2 to 5 is 1 point, and the answer "no" is 0 points. The total score ranged from 0 to 5, with a score of â‰¥2 indicating the presence of depression., From 2023.8~2025.12.
