Treatment of Patients With Recurrent High-Grade Glioma With APG-157 and Bevacizumab
The goal of this interventional study is to evaluate the efficacy of APG-157 in combination with Bevacizumab in subjects with recurrent high-grade glioma. The main questions the study aims to answer are:

* Progression-free and overall survival of patients receiving this combination;
* Quality of Life (QOL); and
* Tumor response on imaging

The participants will take APG-157 daily by dissolving two pastilles in their mouth at around breakfast, lunch and dinner time (total of six pastilles per day). The pastilles dissolve in the mouth.

The participants will continue to receive Bevacizumab as standard of care.
Glioma|Glioblastoma Multiforme
DRUG: APG-157
Progression-free Survival, To evaluate progression-free survival of participants with recurrent high-grade glioma treated with APG-157 and Bevacizumab. Progression of the disease will be assessed using commonly used imaging modality such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging or CT scan., From date of commencement of treatment until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever comes first, assessed up to 12 months|Overall Survival, To evaluate overall survival of participants with recurrent high-grade glioma treated with APG-157 and Bevacizumab, From date of commencement of treatment until the date of death from any cause. Duration of assessment will be 12 months from the date of commencement of the treatment.
QOL assessment (EORTC QLQ-C30), Descriptively examine quality of life (QOL) using EORTC QLQ-C30 (Organization for Research and Treatment in Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30). EORTC QLQ-C30 is a standardized questionnaire that rates function, symptoms and health status from patient perspective using various questions on a scale of 1 - 4 where generally 1 is rated as normal or no issue (not at all) and 4 being the maximum adverse impact being experienced (very much)., Every 8 weeks; from date of commencement of treatment until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever comes first, assessed up to 12 months|Radiographic studies MRI or CT of the brain, To measure tumor size in response to treatment, Every 8 weeks; from date of commencement of treatment until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 12 months|Pharmacokinetics (PK) of APG-157, Measure the amount of APG-157 components in the blood in the presence of bevacizumab, At three timepoints: at start of dosing; at end of cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days); and at end of cycle 2 after start of dosing.
The goal of this interventional study is to evaluate the efficacy of APG-157 in combination with Bevacizumab in subjects with recurrent high-grade glioma who have previously progressed on bevacizumab alone. The main questions the study aims to answer are:

* Progression-free and overall survival of patients receiving this combination;
* Quality of Life (QOL); and
* Tumor response on imaging

Additional aims include:

* characterization of pharmacokinetics (PK) of APG-157 in the presence of bevacizumab; and
* optionally serum changes in VEGF and HIF-1 alpha, if the study shows preliminary indication of efficacy

The participants will take APG-157 daily by dissolving two pastilles in their mouth at around breakfast, lunch and dinner time (total of 6 pastilles per day). The pastilles dissolve in the mouth.

The participants will continue to receive Bevacizumab and be present for scheduled visits and examinations as standard of care.
