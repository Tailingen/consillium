Patient Reported Outcomes Study Using Electronic Monitoring System for Advanced or Metastatic Solid Cancer
This is a multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled study to test the hypothesis that ePRO monitoring added to usual care helps prolong OS or maintain and improve HRQoL in patients with unresectable advanced cancers or metastatic/recurrent solid tumors receiving systemic drug therapy.
