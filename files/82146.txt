Incidence and Prognostic Significance of HER-2 Status Discordance Between Primary Breast Cancer and Paired Recurrent/Metastatic Lesions
About a half of HER2-negative breast cancer show HER2-low expression that can be targeted by new antibody-drug conjugates. The main aim of this study is to describe the evolution of HER2 expression from primary BC to relapse by including HER2-low category in both primary and recurrent BC samples. Patients with matched primary and relapse BC samples were included. 1299 patients were included.

OTHER: no intervention
overall survival, The overall survival (OS) was defined as time from the date of initial diagnosis of recurrent/metastatic disease to the date of death from any cause, up to 200 months
