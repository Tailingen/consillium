A Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Imatinib Mesylate in Patients With Unresectable or Metastatic Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors Expressing C-kit Gene
In the core study, participants with unresectable or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors expressing c-kit were treated with either 400 mg or 600 mg imatinib mesylate for 3 years. The 10 year extension study allowed participants, who successfully completed the core study, to continue study treatment with imatinib mesylate provided they still benefited from treatment and did not demonstrate safety concerns as per the investigator's opinion.
Unresectable or Metastatic Malignant Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST)
DRUG: Imatinib mesylate
Best Tumor Response (Core), Best tumor response was based on the Southwestern Oncology Group (SWOG) criteria. Objective tumor response assessments were categorized according to the following criteria: complete response (CR), partial response (PR), no change or stable disease (SD), progression of disease (PD), unknown where the progression has not been documented and one or more measurable or evaluable sites have not been assessed (UNK), status after resection for progression (RP), status after resection for safety (RS), status after preventive resection (RPR), progressive after first resection (PDR) and not evaluable. Any tumor assessment after surgical resection for preventative reasons was treated like tumor assessments of UNK for calculation of best response. Tumor assessments with current objective status = RP, RS or PDR were treated like assessments with objective tumor status = PD n the calculation of best response., Month 36|Best Tumor Response (Core + Extension), Best tumor response was based on the Southwestern Oncology Group (SWOG) criteria.

Tumor assessments with current objective status = RP, RS or PDR were treated like assessments with objective tumor status = PD n the calculation of best response., Month 156
Overall Survival (Core), Overall survival was analyzed as time to event for all participants. Participants who did not die were censored at the last date known alive, which is the last date of any study medication, laboratory sample, tumor assessment, adverse event end date or date of last contact., Date of first imatinib dose to the date of death during the core period, up to 36 months.|Overall Survival (Core + Extension), Overall survival was analyzed as time to event for all participants. Participants who did not die were censored at the last date known alive, which is the last date of any study medication, laboratory sample, tumor assessment, adverse event end date or date of last contact., Date of first imatinib dose to the date of death during the core and extension periods, up to 156 months.|Duration of Response (Core), Duration of response was analyzed as time to event for all participants whose best response was at least a PR. The onset of response was the first tumor assessment that was subsequently confirmed to constitute at least a partial best response. The end of response was the first tumor assessment noting PD., Date of confirmed best PR or CR to date of confirmed disease progression during the core period, up to 36 months.|Duration of Response (Core + Extension), Duration of response was analyzed as time to event for all participants whose best response was at least a PR. The onset of response was the first tumor assessment that was subsequently confirmed to constitute at least a partial best response. The end of response was the first tumor assessment noting PD., Date of confirmed best PR or CR to date of confirmed disease progression during the core and extension periods, up to 156 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS) (Core + Extension), Progression free survival was analyzed as a time to event for each participant. If a participant had no event, then the PFS was censored at the last tumor assessment., Date of first imatinib dose to earliest date of progression, resection due to safety/progression, death due to any cause or discontinuation due to unsatisfactory therapeutic effect during the core and extension periods, up to 156 months.|Time to Treatment Failure (Core), Time to treatment failure was analyzed as time to event for all participants. Participants who had neither progressed, died nor discontinued from the trial for any reason other than the condition no longer required therapy were censored for analysis ate the time of their last tumor assessment., Date of first imatinib dose to date of earliest occurrence of progression, death due to any cause, or discontinuation from the trial for any reason other than the condition no longer required therapy during the core period, up to 36 months.|Time to Treatment Failure (Core + Extension), Time to treatment failure was analyzed as time to event for all participants. Participants who had neither progressed, died nor discontinued from the trial for any reason other than the condition no longer required therapy were censored for analysis at the time of their last tumor assessment., Date of first imatinib dose to date of earliest occurrence of progression, death due to any cause, or discontinuation from the trial for any reason other than the condition no longer required therapy during the core and extension periods, up to 156 month.|Time to Onset of Response (Core), Time to response was analyzed as time to event for all participants. Participants who did not meet the definition of confirmed PR/CR were censored at the time of their last progression-free tumor assessment., Date of first imatinib dose to the date of the first tumor assessment that was later confirmed to be at least a partial response during the core period, up to 36 months.|Time to Onset of Response (Core + Extension), Time to response was analyzed as time to event for all participants. Participants who did not meet the definition of confirmed PR/CR were censored at the time of their last progression-free tumor assessment., Date of first imatinib dose to the date of the first tumor assessment that was later confirmed to be at least a partial response during the core and extension periods, up to 156 months.|Time to Progression (Core + Extension), Time to progression was analyzed as time to event for all participants. Participants who had neither progressed, died nor discontinued from the trial for any reason other than the condition no longer required therapy were censored for analysis at the time of their last tumor assessment., Date of first imatinib dose to date of progression or death due to disease indication or discontinuation due to unsatisfactory therapeutic effect during the core and extension periods, up to 156 months.
