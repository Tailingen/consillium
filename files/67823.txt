Using Patients' Social Contact to Improve Out-Patient Endoscopy Among Blacks
Non-attendance to out-patient endoscopic procedures is high among underserved blacks. The overall goal of this proposal is to evaluate the effect of directly involving a social contact (chosen by the patient) on completion and quality of out-patient endoscopy recommended for the patient by his/her primary care physician, or after scheduling by the gastrointestinal endoscopist.

Improved adherence and better quality of procedures are postulated with involvement of social contacts.

BEHAVIORAL: Social contact intervention
Compliance with appointment and colonoscopy, For primary care subjects: Making appointment with Gastrointestinal endoscopist within 3 months and completing colonoscopy within 6 months of enrolment, 6 months|Compliance with scheduled upper endoscopy and colonoscopy, For specialty subjects: Completing scheduled upper endoscopy or colonoscopy, Scheduled procedure time, an average of 8 weeks
Bowel preparation quality, Adequacy of bowel preparation with ratings of good to excellent on Aronchick scale, At scheduled colonoscopy, an average of 8 weeks
Social contact's activity, Characteristics of participants and Lubbens social network scale correlation with other outcomes and activities of the social contact, During the duration of the project, an average of 6 months
The overarching goal of this proposal is to determine whether directly involving a social contact, chosen by the patient, will improve the completion and quality of scheduled out-patient endoscopy among blacks.

These are three sub-projects:

Project 1: Involves recruiting 400 patients referred for colonoscopy by their primary care physicians

Project 2: Involves recruiting 400 patients scheduled for colonoscopy by their endoscopist

Project 3: Involves recruiting 200 patients scheduled for upper endoscopy by their endoscopists
