MRI-Guided Lattice Extreme Ablative Dose Radiotherapy For Prostate Cancer
The hypotheses of this study are:

1. Delivery of single fraction Lattice Extreme Ablative Dose (LEAD) radiotherapy (RT) to the dominant tumor lesion(s) in the prostate as identified by multiparametric functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging is safe and feasible when given prior to standard prostate radiotherapy.
2. Biomarker expression levels differ in the functional MRI identified suspicious tumor regions and unsuspicious tumor regions. The investigators hypothesize that a significant source of variation in biomarker levels is due to tumor heterogeneity and that it is molecular abnormalities in the dominant tumor areas that are angiogenic and determine outcome.
Prostate Cancer|Prostate Adenocarcinoma
RADIATION: Lattice Extreme Ablative Dose Radiation Therapy|RADIATION: Standard IMRT
Number of Study Participants Experiencing Treatment-Related Toxicity, Toxicity are any Grade 2 or higher treatment-related adverse events as assessed by treating physician using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) Version 4.0., Up to 8.5 weeks|Percentage of Enrolled Patients for Whom LEAD RT Dose Can be Successfully Administered Following MRI-guided Planning., The percentage of enrolled patients for whom LEAD RT dose can be successfully administered following MRI-guided planning., Up to 8 weeks
Number of Participants With Remaining Tumor Cells in the Prostate Post Treatment, The number of participants with positive tumor cells left in the prostate after LEAD RT as evaluated by prostate biopsy., Up to 2.5 Years|Percentage of Participants With Positive Prostate Biopsies After Completion of Treatment, Preliminary indication of efficacy of treatment will be reported as the percentage of participants with positive prostate biopsies after completion of treatment., From Baseline to 2.5 Years Post Completion of Study Therapy (Approximately 3 years)|Rate of Participants That Achieve Failure-Free Survival (FFS), The percentage of participants achieving FFS will be reported. Failure-free is defined as no documented evidence of biochemical and/or or clinical failure or death from any cause, whichever occur first. Biochemical failure is defined is a increase of 2 or greater from nadir of Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) levels. Clinical Failure is defined as newly identified extension outside the prostate after initial regression, or urinary obstructive symptoms with carcinoma or regional/distant failure due to radiographic evidence metastasis., Up to 6 years|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the elapsed time from study enrollment to death from any cause. For surviving patients, follow-up will be censored at the date of last contact., Up to 6 years|HrQoL as Assessed by EPIC-SF12 Questionnaire, Health-related Quality of Life (HRQOL) will be measured using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite and Medical Outcomes Study SF-12 (EPIC SF-12) to evaluate patient function and satisfaction after prostate cancer treatment. The questionnaire has 5 subscales (Urinary Function, Urinary Symptoms, Bowel Habits, Sexual Function and Hormonal Function). Each subscale has a total score ranging from 0-100, with higher scores representing better HRQOL., At Baseline (Prior to RT), at 8 weeks (Last week of RT), At 6 weeks post RT, At 3 months post RT, At 6 months post RT, At 9 months post RT, At 15 months post RT, At 27 months post RT, At 39 months post RT, At 51 months post RT, At 63 months post RT|HrQoL as Assessed by MAX-PC Questionnaire, Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) will be measured using the scores on the Modified 18-item Memorial Anxiety Scale for Prostate Cancer (MAX-PC) from pre-treatment to post-treatment. The scale consists of 18 items (e.g. "I thought about prostate cancer even though I didn't mean to.") scored on a scale from 0 ("not at all") to 3 ("often"). Total scores range from 0 to 54, with higher scores indicating higher levels of anxiety., At Baseline (Prior to RT), at 8 weeks (Last week of RT), At 6 weeks post RT, At 3 months post RT, At 6 months post RT, At 9 months post RT, At 15 months post RT, At 27 months post RT, At 39 months post RT, At 51 months post RT, At 63 months post RT
