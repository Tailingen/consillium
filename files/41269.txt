QUILT-3.051: NANT Ovarian Cancer Vaccine: Combination Immunotherapy in Subjects With Epithelial Ovarian Cancer Who Have Progressed on or After Standard-of-care (SoC) Therapy
This is a phase 1b/2 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of metronomic combination therapy in subjects with epithelial ovarian cancer who have progressed on or after SoC therapy.

Treatment will be administered in two phases, an induction and a maintenance phase. Subjects will continue induction treatment for up to 1 year or until they experience progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity (not correctable with dose reduction), withdraw consent, or if the Investigator feels it is no longer in the subject's best interest to continue treatment. Those who have a complete response (CR) in the induction phase will enter the maintenance phase of the study. Subjects may remain in the maintenance phase of the study for up to 1 year. Treatment will continue in the maintenance phase until the subject experiences PD or unacceptable toxicity (not correctable with dose reduction), withdraws consent, or if the Investigator feels it is no longer in the subject's best interest to continue treatment. The maximum time on study treatment, including both the induction and maintenance phases, is 2 years.
