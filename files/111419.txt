RFR Change of Precise Segmental Versus Complete Renal Arterial Clamping During LPN for Clinical T1 RCC
Renal functional reserve may be better in patients with clinical T1 renal cell carcinoma(RCC) undergoing laparoscopic partial nephrectomy with precise segmental renal artery clamping than those with complete renal arterial clamping.
Renal Cell Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: precise segmental renal arterial clamping|PROCEDURE: laparoscopic partial nephrectomy
Renal Functional Reserve change, Change in renal functional reserve after laparoscopic partial nephrectomy, 3 month after surgery.
Renal functional reserve (RFR) describes the capacity of the intact nephron mass to increase glomerular filtration rate(GFR) from baseline in response to stimuli (e.g., protein load).We hypothesized that renal functional reserve may be better in patients with clinical T1 renal cell carcinoma(RCC) undergoing laparoscopic partial(LPN) nephrectomy with precise segmental renal artery clamping than those with complete renal arterial clamping.
