Multi-Line Therapy Trial in Unresectable Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
STRATEGIC-1 is a study designed to determine the best sequence of therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.
Colorectal Cancer Metastatic
BIOLOGICAL: FOLFIRI-cetuximab|BIOLOGICAL: mFOLFOX6-bevacizumab|BIOLOGICAL: OPTIMOX-bevacizumab|BIOLOGICAL: irinotecan-based chemo + bevacizumab|BIOLOGICAL: Anti-EGFR agent (cetuximab +/- irinotecan or panitumumab)|BIOLOGICAL: XELOX + bevacizumab
Duration of Disease Control (DDC), DDC is defined as the sum of PFS of each active treatment course planned in the treatment strategy. DDC excludes 1) intervals between disease progression and re-initiation of treatment, and 2) PFS of inactive treatment if PD occurs at first evaluation after treatment re-initiation (either reintroduction in a stop-and-go strategy or subsequent course of treatment in a multi-line strategy)., From baseline until end of strategy; up to 80 months after the beginning of the study
Assessment of Quality of life (QoL), QoL will be considered to be improved if at least one time to QoL score deterioration (5 targeted dimensions) will be significantly longer without a significant shorter time to QoL score dimensions for other 4 targeted dimensions., From baseline until end of strategy; up to 80 months after the beginning of the study|Overall Survival (OS), Time from randomization to the date of death from any cause, Up to 80 months after the beginning of the study|Time to Failure of Strategy (TFS), TFS is defined as beginning with the initiation of the strategy under investigation and ending with the first of the following events: 1) death, 2) disease progression on the last received planned sequence, 3) patient requires the addition of a new (unplanned) therapeutic agent, 4) patient experiences disease progression during a partial or complete break in therapy from initial treatment strategy and receives no further therapy within one month., Up to 80 months after the beginning of the study|Progression-free survival (PFS) per sequence of therapy, Time from randomization to the date of first documented disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 80 months after the beginning of the study|Tumor Response Rate (RR), Tumor response will be assessed using RECIST version 1.1 per sequence of therapy, From baseline until end of strategy; up to 80 months after the beginning of the study|Curative salvage surgery rate, The number of patient with R0 and R1 curative salvage surgery will be assessed globally (per arm) and per sequence of therapy, From baseline until end of strategy; up to 80 months after the beginning of the study|Safety profile of each treatment sequence, The report will take into account all adverse events observed during and after drug administration, including any adverse events that may be related to the administration procedure itself., From study entry to 1 month after last study drug administration; up to 80 months after the beginning of the study
This is a phase III study assessing 2 mutli-line therapeutic strategies in patients with unresectable wild-type RAS metastatic colorectal cancer. All the available treatments are being used in each strategy (oxaliplatine, irinotecan, fluoropyrimidines, bevacizumab, cetuximab or panitumumab) but in a different order:

STRATEGY A: FOLFIRI-cetuximab, followed by oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy with bevacizumab vs.

STRATEGY B: OPTIMOX-bevacizumab, followed by irinotecan-based chemotherapy with bevacizumab, followed by anti-EGFR mab with or without irinotecan.
