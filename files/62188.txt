To determine efficacy in the delivery of chronomodulated chemotherapy.
Colorectal Neoplasms
DRUG: 5-Fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, avastin
The primary objective is to determine if the rate of adverse events among patients receiving chronoFOLFOX plus Avastin is acceptable compared to that in previous studies using the FOLFOX4 regimen., 2 years
The purpose of this study is to determine if treatment with 5-Fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and Avastin will cause colorectal tumor cells to shrink or disappear. The study will also determine the safety of these drugs when given together and the quality of life of the patients who are enrolled in the study.

It is thought that these drugs will be better tolerated if they are chronomodulated, i.e., if they are given at certain times of day rather than as a continuous infusion.
