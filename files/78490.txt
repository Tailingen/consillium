Performances on Cognitive Functions and Brain Function and Follow-up After Different Treatments in Patients With Autonomous Cortisol Secretion: a Single-center, Prospective, Observational Study
This is a single center, prospective, observational study to explore and evaluate the differences on cognitive function and brain function by functional-MRI in autonomous cortisol secretion patients, and the different treatments methods on the cognitive function and brain function in patients with autonomous cortisol secretion

Glucocorticoids, mainly cortisol, play a crucial role in the allostatic process of adjustment to stressors and can determine important changes in central nervous system structures. It is well known that Cushing's syndrome (CS) is associated with neurocognitive impairment in about two-thirds of cases. In CS the most frequent reported alterations are memory impairment (about 83% of cases) and reduced concentration (66% of cases) . Unfortunately, these alterations are only partially reversible after the hypercortisolism resolution. As so far, data related to the impact of autonomous cortisol secretion (ACS) on cognitive function are scarce and lack of magnetic resonance indicators. Few studies have studied the cognitive function changes of patients with ACS by surgical and conservative treatment. In the single center, prospective and observational study we aim to explore cognitive functions and brain function by functional-MRI in adrenal incidentaloma patients in relation to the presence of ACS and, secondly, in a group of acs patients, the effect of adrenalectomy on cognitive functions and brain function.
