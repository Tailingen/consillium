MGTA-145 + Plerixafor in the Mobilization of HSCs for Allogeneic Transplant in Hematologic Malignancies
This research study tests a new medicine for mobilizing stem cells so they can be collected and used for allogeneic stem cell transplant for treatment of hematological malignancies. MGTA-145, the new medicine, will be given with plerixafor.

This is a Phase II, open-label, multicenter, prospective study of MGTA-145 + plerixafor mobilized HLA-matched sibling and matched unrelated donor allografts for myeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in recipients with hematological malignancies. Donors will undergo 1 or 2 days of mobilization and apheresis.
