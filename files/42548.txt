Investigator Initiated Phase 1 Study of TBI-1201
Following pre-treatment with cyclophosphamide and/or fludarabine, MAGE-A4-specific TCR gene transduced T lymphocytes are transferred to the patients with MAGE-A4-expressing solid tumors.
Solid Tumors
DRUG: TBI-1201|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Fludarabine
Incidence and grade of adverse events (CTCAE), Confirm the toxicity profile, which is measured by the degree of grade and seriousness, duration, causality, classification, etc. of the adverse events., 8 weeks|Appearance of replication competent retrovirus by PCR, Confirm no replication competent retrovirus observed, 8 weeks|Appearance of clonality by LAM-PCR, Confirm no clonality is observed, 8 weeks|Kinetics of TBI-1201 in blood by realtime-PCR and flow cytometry, Evaluate persistence and expansion of transferred TBI-1201, 8 weeks
Following pre-treatment with cyclophosphamide alone or in combination with fludarabine, MAGE-A4-specific TCR gene transduced T lymphocytes are transferred to HLA-A\*24:02 positive patients with solid tumors which are 1) unresectable, refractory to standard therapy (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, etc), metastatic or recurrent, and 2) MAGE-A4-expressing. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and in vivo kinetics, and the secondary is to evaluate clinical effect.
