Linperlisib Combined With Camrelizumab and Pegaspargase in Advanced or Relapsed/Refractory NK/T-cell Lymphoma
The patients diagnosed with relapsed/refractory or advanced NK/T-cell Lymphoma (r/r NKTCL) were selected as the research objects. To explore effective and safe treatment for advanced or r/r NKTCL, the combination of PI3K-δ inhibitor Linperlisib with PD-1 blockade Camrelizumab and anti-metabolic agent Pegaspargase was applied for the treatment.
Natural Killer/T-Cell Lymphoma, Nasal and Nasal-Type|T-lymphoblastic Lymphoma

The best objective response rate（ORR） over 6 treatment cycles, Overall response rate means sum of complete response rate and partial response rate, Within 6 treatment cycles (each cycle is 21 days)
Objective Response Rate（ORR）, Objective response rate means sum of complete response rate and partial response rate, At the end of 2nd, 4th, 6th treatment cycles,respectively (each cycle is 21 days)|Complete Response （CR）, CR was defined as complete remission evaluated using PET-CT scan or BM test, At the end of 2nd, 4th, 6th treatment cycles,respectively (each cycle is 21 days)|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression free survival was defined as the period from the start of treatment to the date of confirmed disease progression or death from any cause., From date of enrollment until the date of progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assesed up to 2 years.|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the time from the date of treatment to the date of death., From date of enrollment until the date of documented death from any cause or follow up, whichever came first, assesed up to 2 years.|Disease Control Rate（DCR）, Disease control rate discribes the percentage of patients with advanced cancer whose therapeutic intervention has led to a complete response, partial response, or stable disease, Up to 2 years after enrollment.
Drug safety, According to NCI CTCAE v5.0, up to 2 years after enrollment
This is a prospective, single-arm, single-center Ib/II clinical trial that included an initial safety run-in phase with safety monitoring before the main enrollment (expansion phase).The aim of phase Ib is to evaluate the recommended phase 2 dose and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), and the aim of phase II study is to evaluate, for the first time, the safety and efficacy of the treatment of Linperlisib combined with PD-1 blockade Camrelizumab and Pegaspargase in patients diagnosed with advanced or r/r ENKTL, respectively.
