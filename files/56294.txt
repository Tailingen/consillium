Tucatinib, Trastuzumab, Ramucirumab, and Paclitaxel Versus Paclitaxel and Ramucirumab in Previously Treated HER2+ Gastroesophageal Cancer
This study is being done to see if tucatinib with trastuzumab, ramucirumab and paclitaxel works better than ramucirumab and paclitaxel to treat HER2-positive (HER2+) cancer of the gut (stomach or gastroesophageal cancer). This study will also look at what side effects happen when participants take this combination of drugs. A side effect is anything the drug does other than treating cancer.

Study treatment will be given in 28-day cycles.

In the Phase 2 part of the trial, participants and their doctors will know what drugs are being given (open-label). In the Phase 3 part, the study is "blinded." This means that participants, their doctor, and the study sponsor will not know which drugs are being given.

This study is being done to see if tucatinib with trastuzumab, ramucirumab and paclitaxel works better than ramucirumab and paclitaxel to treat HER2-positive (HER2+) cancer of the gut (stomach or gastroesophageal cancer). This study will also look at what side effects happen when participants take this combination of drugs. A side effect is anything the drug does other than treating cancer.

Study treatment will be given in 28-day cycles.

In the Phase 2 part of the trial, participants and their doctors will know what drugs are being given (open-label). In the Phase 3 part, the study is "blinded." This means that participants, their doctor, and the study sponsor will not know which drugs are being given.
