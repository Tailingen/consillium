A Study of Tiragolumab in Combination With Atezolizumab in Chemotherapy-NaÃ¯ve Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of tiragolumab plus atezolizumab compared with placebo plus atezolizumab in chemotherapy-naive patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic PD-L1-selected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), excluding patients with a sensitizing EGFR mutation or ALK translocation.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Atezolizumab|DRUG: Tiragolumab|DRUG: Placebo
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR, defined as a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) on two consecutive occasions \>/=4 weeks apart, as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1. CR: Disappearance of all target lesions. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters, in the absence of CR., From baseline until a total of 80 progression free survival (PFS) events have occurred (up to approximately 11 months)|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS, defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression (PD), as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. PD: At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters at prior timepoints (including baseline)., From baseline until a total of 80 PFS events have occurred (up to approximately 11 months)
Duration of Objective Response (DOR), DOR, defined as the time from the first occurrence of a documented objective response (CR or PR) to disease progression (PD), as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. CR: Disappearance of all target lesions. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters, in the absence of CR. PD: At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters at prior timepoints (including baseline)., Up to 6 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS, defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause., Up to 6 years|Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events, An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events., Up to 6 years|Serum Concentrations of Tiragolumab, Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 2 Day 1, Cycle 4 Day 1, Cycle 12 Day 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Serum Concentrations of Atezolizumab, Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 2 Day 1, Cycle 4 Day 1, Cycle 12 Day 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Percentage of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADAs), Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 2 Day 1, Cycle 4 Day 1, Cycle 12 Day 1 (each cycle is 21 days)
