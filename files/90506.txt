This is a Phase 1/2, first in human (FIH), open-label, multicenter study of BHV-1510, a Trop-2 directed antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), in participants with previously treated, advanced solid tumors. The study comprises 2 parts: a Phase 1 Dose Escalation and a Phase 2 Dose Expansion. The Phase 1 will investigate the safety and tolerability of BHV-1510 given in monotherapy and given in combination with cemiplimab and identify one or more recommended doses for expansion (RDEs) and the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) (if one exists). Once the RDE has been established, Phase 2 will open to investigate the preliminary efficacy of BHV-1510 in signal-finding expansion cohorts.
