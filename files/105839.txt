measure of progression free survival (obtained by the delay between the date of initiation of immunotherapy until the date of first documented progression disease in patients with melanoma or NSCLC treated by immunotherapy, From date of initiation of treatment until the date of first documented progression disease according to different criteria in interim PET/CT 1.

18F-FDG PET/CT imaging was performed prior to (18F-FDG PET/CT 0) and 14 weeks after ICI onset (18F-FDG PET/CT 1). Assessment of patient response to treatment was done according to RECIST1.1, iRECIST, PERCIST and PECRIT criteria., up to 50 months
measure of overall survival (obtained by the delay between the date of initiation of immunotherapy until the date of death related to disease in patients with melanoma or NSCLC treated by immunotherapy, From date of initiation of treatment until the date of death related to disease according to different criteria in interim PET/CT 1.

18F-FDG PET/CT imaging was performed prior to (18F-FDG PET/CT 0) and 14 weeks after ICI onset (18F-FDG PET/CT 1). Assessment of patient response to treatment was done according to RECIST1.1, iRECIST, PERCIST and PECRIT criteria., up to 50 months|Study different criteria (RECIST, iRECIST, PERCIST and PECRIT) to predict PFS or OS, Interpretation according to 4 criteria to predict response to immunotherapy, up to 50 months|study the potential correlation between PET data and clinicobiological data, correlation between adverse events (AE) due to immunotherapy described on PET data and AE detected on clinicobiological data, up to 50 months
