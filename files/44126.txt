Neuroendocrine Tumors of Old Patients in the West of France
Neuroendocrine cancer remains a poorly known entity. Comprehensive treatment is multidisciplinary involving surgery, radiological and nuclear medicine, and medical. A national network for the management of sporadic and hereditary malignant neuro-ENdocrine Tumor (RENATEN) is in charged of coordinating this specific care. This is part of the French National Cancer INstitute (INCa) Rare Cancer Plan.

The project is in the form of an analysis of elderly population (75 years or over) with a diagnosis of neuroendocrine cancer in the western part of the France (Brittany, Pays de Loire, Normandy, Center and a part of New Aquitaine areas) representing a population of more than 12 millions of inhabitants. Oncogeriatric evaluations, specialized meetings, ...would be analysed in order to improve the care of rare cancer patients.
