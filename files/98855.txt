An Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Copanlisib in Combination With Nivolumab in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of the dose escalation part of this study is to determine the feasibility of using the combination of copanlisib and nivolumab in subjects with advanced solid tumors, and to determine the maximum tolerated dose of copanlisib in combination with nivolumab. The maximum tolerated dose will then be used in Phase 2 (dose expansion) of the study.

Study was originally designed with both Phase I and Phase II part, but sponsor decided not to conduct Phase 2 part due to strategic portfolio re-prioritization.
