A Comparison Between Ivor-Lewis and McKeown Minimally Invasive Esophagectomy
Surgery is still the main treatment for esophageal cancer, however, the complication and mortality rate of open esophagectomy is high. As a result, the thoracoscopic- laparoscopic minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) was developed. The MIE mainly comprised two surgical approaches:

MIE McKeown approach (cervical anastomosis) and MIE Ivor-Lewis approach (intrathoracicanastomosis). The MIE with intrathoracic anastomosis (Ivor-Lewis) is increasingly used for the treatment of mid and lower esophageal cancers. Our study is trying to compare the safety, feasibility, and short-term and long- term outcomes between MIE Ivor-Lewis approach and MIE McKeown approach for the treatment of lower thoracic esophageal cancer and esophageal- gastric junction.
