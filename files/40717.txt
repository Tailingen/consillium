A Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics (PK), and Antitumor Activity of ALK202 in Participants with Advanced Solid Tumors
TThis is a first-in-human (FIH), open-label, multicenter dose escalation and expansion study of ALK202. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and antitumor activity of ALK202 as a monotherapy in adult participants with Advanced Solid Tumors. The study will also identify recommended dose(s) for subsequent clinical studies of ALK202.
