NOvel Immunotherapy Strategies for Advanced Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) Patients: TONIC-3 Trial
This is a single center, non-blinded, multi-cohort, non-comparative phase II trial to study the safety and efficacy of tiragolumab with atezolizumab and/or ipilimumab in advanced triple-negative breast cancer.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Tiragolumab|DRUG: Atezolizumab|DRUG: Ipilimumab
PFS-12, Progression-free survival rate as measured by the proportion of patients free of progression after 12-weeks of treatment, Assessed at 12 weeks|Incidence of adverse events, Number of patients with adverse events as measured according to CTCAE v5.0, Assessed until 90 days after the last dose of study treatment or until initiation of new anti-cancer therapy, whichever occurs first
Objective response rate, Complete response or partial response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours in cancer immunotherapy trials (iRECIST) and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST version 1.1), Assessed at week 6, week 12 and every 12 weeks thereafter; assessed up to 120 months|Clinical benefit rate, Complete response, partial response or stable disease for at least 24 weeks according to iRECIST and RECIST1.1, Assessed at week 6, week 12 and every 12 weeks thereafter; assessed up to 120 months|Progression-free survival, Time from randomization to data of first tumor progression, Assessed at week 6, week 12 and every 12 weeks thereafter; median 12 months|Overall survival, Time from therapy initiation to death from any cause, Assessed monthly until date of death; median 12 months
Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) -blockade is currently being approved for the neoadjuvant treatment of early TNBC as well as for first-line treatment in combination with chemotherapy for patients with Programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) -positive TNBC with metastatic disease. However, response rates are modest, responses are not always durable and PD-L1 is a suboptimal biomarker to select patients for this regimen. Therefore, the overarching goal of this TONIC-3 study is to develop novel immunomodulatory strategies for patients with advanced TNBC making use state-of-the-art research tools to better understand the underlying cancer-immune interactions of this disease
