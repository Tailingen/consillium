Supraclavicular Lymph Node Dissection for Ipsilateral Supraclavicular Lymph Node Metastatic Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of surgical dissection of supraclavicular lymph nodes combined with radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone in patients with ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph node metastasis.

In this study, patients with ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph node positive breast cancer were selected as research subjects. Randomized controlled method was used to study the effects of surgical dissection of supraclavicular lymph node combined with radiotherapy and radiotherapy alone on progression-free survival and overall survival of breast cancer. This RCT aims to explore the best treatment method for ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph node metastasis and to provide the basis for guiding the precise treatment of supraclavicular lymph node chain.
