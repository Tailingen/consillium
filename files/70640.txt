Real World Evidence of Long-term Safety and Efficacy in Patients Treated With Durvalumab After Concurrent Chemoradiation for Unresectable Stage III NSCLC
This observational study is designed to assess the long term safety of the durvalumab treatment period including subsequent treatment period and demonstrate the efficacy of patients treated with durvalumab following chemoradiation therapy in the real world.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
Incidence of pneumonitis and AESI, Pneumonitis and AESIs will be summarized at least following categories

* Pneumonitis within three years from the start of durvalmab treatment
* Pneumonitis and AESIs during treatment period of durvalmab
* Pneumonitis and AESIs after durvalmab treatment, 3 years|To assess progression free survival (PFS) of durvalumab, PFS is defined as the time from the start of durvalumab treatment to first progression disease (PD) or death, whichever is earlier. In case the patients without progression or death, patients will be censored at the last follow-up date or the first date of the 1st subsequent treatment, whichever is earlier., PFS is assessed as PFS median for time of 3 years
To assess overall survaival (OS) of durvalumab, OS is defined as the time from the date of start of the durvalumab treatment until death due to any causes. Any patient not known to have died at the time of analysis will be censored based on the last recorded date on which the patient was known to be alive., OS is assessed as median OS for time of 3 years|Incidence of pneumonitis and AESIs in patient subset populations, Summary of pneumonitis and AESIs in each durvalumab treatment status in patient subset populations, 3 years
Study design: Prospective multi-center non-interventional cohort study Data Source(s): Medical records of patients who are treated with durvalumab following chemoradiation therapy Study Population: Patients prescribed and treated with durvalumab for unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) at first time following chemoradiation therapy and who provide written informed consent.

Exposure(s): durvalumab Outcome(s): Summary of pneumonitis and adverse event special interest (AESI), progression free survaival (PFS), overall survaival (OS), Reasons of discontinuation of durvalumab treatment, Details of subsequent treatments after durvalumab Sample Size Estimations: 500 patients Statistical Analysis: Only descriptive analysis and no formal test
