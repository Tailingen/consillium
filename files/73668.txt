Neoadjuvant Toripalimab Plus Nimotuzumab in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma Prior to Radical Therapy
This study aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant Toripalimab combined with Nimotuzumab in primary limited stage oral squamous cell carcinoma prior to radical therapy.
Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Toripalimab
Major Pathologic response (MPR) rate, MPR rate is defined as the proportion of participants who have achieved major pathological response（on routine hematoxylin and eosin staining, tumors with no more than 10% viable tumor cells) in all participants who have completed the neoadjuvant therapy and underwent surgery., up to 18 months
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants having a complete response or partial response (according to RECIST v1.1) as confirmed by CT or MRI evaluation in all patients who have completed the neoadjuvant therapy., up to 18 months|2-year disease-free survival rate (DFS), DFS is defined as the time from the first day of randomization to the date of first record of disease recurrence or death after radical treatment, up to 42 months|2-year progression-free survival rate (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the first day of randomization to the date of first record of disease progression or death., up to 42 months|2-year overall survival rate (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause., up to 42 months|Change in PD-L1 expression, Change in the expression of PD-L1 in the tumor tissues from before and after neoadjuvant therapy, based on quantification using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and image analysis., up to 42 months|QoL scores as evaluated by EORTC H&N 35., QoL scores as evaluated the quality of life by EORTC H\&N 35., up to 42 months|Incidence and severity of adverse events as evaluated by NCI-CTCAEv5.0., Number of participants experiencing any sign, symptom, disease, or worsening of preexisting conditions associated with the experimental interventions, up to 18 months
Change in Lymphocyte phenotype, Changes in the proportion of important immune cells such as CD8+T lymphocytes, CD4+T lymphocytes, dendritic cells (DC) 、NK cells in peripheral blood before and after neoadjuvant therapy, based on quantification using flow cytometry (FCM) and image analysis., up to 42 months|Change in Immunostimulatory cytokines, Changes in the proportion of Immunostimulatory cytokines such as Interleukins in peripheral blood before and after neoadjuvant therapy, based on quantification using flow cytometry (FCM) and image analysis., up to 42 months
The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant PD-1 inhibitor toripalimab plus nimotuzumab in subjects with primary limited stage, oral squamous cell carcinoma prior to radical therapy. Patients would be treated with neoadjuvant toripalimab plus nimotuzumab for 2 cycles and then received radical surgery or radiotherapy based on the efficacy assessed by investigators per RECIST v1.1.
