Dose-escalation Study of Oral Administration of S 055746 in Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukaemia or Myelodysplastic Syndrome
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety profile and tolerability of S 055746 in patients with AML, and high or very high risk MDS, in terms of Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and determine the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) through safety profile (DLT, MTD), PK profile, PD profile and preliminary efficacy.
Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML)|Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)
DRUG: S 055746
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), MTD is the highest drug dosage that is unlikely (\<25% posterior probability) to cause DLT in more than 33% of the treated patients in the first cycle of S 055746 treatment., During cycle 1 (21 days)|Incidence of Adverse Events (AEs), Characterized by severity and seriousness of AEs, laboratory abnormalities and other safety parameters such as electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, From first dose until 30 days after the last dose intake
Plasma concentration of S 055746, Pre-dose on Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1), C1D2, C1D3, C1D8, C1D9, C2D1 ; 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10-12 hours post-dose on C1D1, C1D8|The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of S 055746: Area Under the Curve [AUC], Pre-dose on Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1), C1D2, C1D3, C1D8, C1D9, C2D1 ; 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10-12 hours post-dose on C1D1, C1D8|The PK profile of S 055746: Maximal Concentration [Cmax], Pre-dose on Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1), C1D2, C1D3, C1D8, C1D9, C2D1 ; 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10-12 hours post-dose on C1D1, C1D8|Best Response Rate (BRR), Up to study completion (maximum of 3 years)|Progression Free Survival (PFS), From date of inclusion until the date of progression or date of death, whichever occurs first, assessed up to study completion (maximum of 3 years)|Event Free Survival (EFS), From date of inclusion until the date of progression or date of death or discontinuation of treatment, whichever occurs first, assessed up to study completion (maximum of 3 years)
