A Clinical Trial of BAT8001 on Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics for Patients
An Open-Label, Dose Escalation Phase I Clinical Trial on Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of BAT8001 for Injection in Patients with HER2-Positive Solid Tumors (breast cancer or gastric cancer)。
HER2-Positive Solid Tumors
DRUG: BAT8001
Dose-limiting toxicity（DLT）, DLT is defined as one of the following as per investigator related to study drug:

1. Grade ≥ 3 non-hematologic, and non-liver organ toxicities (except for Grade 3 diarrhea, nausea and vomiting in the absence of prophylactics);
2. Grade ≥ 3 cardiotoxicity, new segmental wall-motion abnormalities, or troponin I ≥ 0.2 ng/mL;
3. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 45% and a ≥ 10% decrease from baseline;
4. Grade ≥ 4 thrombocytopenia or anemia;
5. Grade ≥ 4 t neutropenia that persists for more than 4 days or accompanied by fever \> 38.3 °C or persistent fever ≥ 38 °C for more than 1 hour;
6. Grade ≥ 3 elevation in any one of total bilirubin (TBIL), aspartate transaminase (AST) or alanine transaminase (ALT).
7. Serum transaminase \> 3 × ULN and TBIL \> 2 × ULN;
8. For Grade 2 abnormalities in AST or ALT at baseline, a measurement ≥ 10 × ULN., A minimum of 21 days after first dose of BAT8001|Maximum tolerated dosed (MTD), The highest dose level resulting in a DLT in ≤ 1 of 6 patients was declared the MTD., A minimum of 21 days after first dose of BAT8001|Area under the curve (AUC)-BAT8001(antibody-drug conjugate), total antibody and Batansine (a maytansine derivative, which is the 3AA-MDC complex), AUC will be evaluated and reported for BAT8001 and its metabolites., pre-infusion (Hour 0), 30 minutes after end of BAT8001 infusion on Day 1 Cycle 1, 2, 3, 4 (each cycle is 21 days) up to approximately 3 months|Maximum serum drug concentration (Cmax)-BAT8001(antibody-drug conjugate), total antibody and Batansine (a maytansine derivative, which is the 3AA-MDC complex), Maximum serum concentration (Cmax) immediately after dosing will be evaluated and reported for BAT8001 and its metabolites., pre-infusion (Hour 0), 30 minutes after end of BAT8001 infusion on Day 1 Cycle 1, 2, 3, 4 (each cycle is 21 days) up to approximately 3 months|Half-life period(t1/2), Half-life (t1/2) will be evaluated and reported., pre-infusion (Hour 0), 30 minutes after end of BAT8001 infusion on Day 1 Cycle 1, 2, 3, 4 (each cycle is 21 days) up to approximately 3 months|Anti drug antibodies (ADA), Plasma level of anti drug antibodies (ADA) correlated with BAT8001 plasma level, pre-infusion (Hour 0) on Day 1 of Cycle 1, 2, 3, 4 (each cycle is 21 days) up to approximately 3 months|Neutralizing anti-drug antibodies (NADA), Neutralizing anti-drug antibodies (NADA) correlated with BAT8001, pre-infusion (Hour 0) on Day 1 of Cycle 1, 2, 3, 4 (each cycle is 21 days) up to approximately 3 months
Progression free survival time(PFS), PFS is defined as the time from first dose date until the date of disease progression or death due to any reason, whichever occurs first., Baseline to the end of the study (up to 3 years)|Overall response rate(ORR), determined by the investigator according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1., Baseline to the end of the study (up to 3 years)
This is an open-label, dose escalation Phase I clinical study in two stages. Stage 1 consists of the first four cycles where the tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of BAT8001 for injections will be studied and preliminary efficacy will be evaluated. Efficacy and safety assessments continue from the fifth cycle until disease progression or intolerable toxicities.
