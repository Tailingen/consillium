Adj. Marker-adjusted Personalized Therapy Comparing ET+Ribociclib vs Chemotherapy in Intermediate Risk, HR+/HER2- EBC
The study investigates, whether the patient group with intermediate-risk early breast cancer benefits from treatment with ribociclib in combination with endocrine therapy compared to standard-of-care chemotherapy (followed by adjuvant endocrine therapy).

The WSG ADAPT trial program is one of the first new generation trials addressing the issue of individualization of (neo)-adjuvant decision-making in early breast cancer (EBC) in a subtype-specific manner. The first WSG ADAPT umbrella trial (NCT01779206) aimed to establish early predictive molecular surrogate markers for response after a short 3-week induction treatment.

The goals of the WSG ADAPT trial program - early response assessment and subtype-specific therapy tailoring to those patients who are most likely to benefit - have contributed to the very positive national and international feedback to the ADAPT concept as a whole.

The aim of this ADAPTcycle phase-III-trial is to investigate whether the intermediate-risk patient group identified during the screening phase derives additional benefit from treatment with ribociclib in combination with ET compared to chemotherapy (followed by adjuvant ET).
