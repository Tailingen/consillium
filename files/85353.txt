Study Of Durvalumab and Lenalidomide In R/R EBV Associated DLBCL Subtypes, Primary CNS And Testicular DLBCL
PHASE II STUDY OF DURVALUMAB IN COMBINATION WITH LENALIDOMIDE IN RELAPSED/REFRACTORY EBV ASSOCIATED SUBTYPES OF DLBCL, PRIMARY CNS LYMPHOMA AND PRIMARY TESTICULAR DLBCL

Patients with relapsed refractory subtypes of DLBCL who fulfill the inclusion / exclusion criteria will be recruited to this trial and treated in this open label, phase 2 trial with the PDL1 inhibitor Durvalumab and Lenalidomide. The combination treatment will be given from the time of recruitment for 6 months when Lenalidomide will be stopped but Durvalumab will continue for a total of 2 years. Response will be assessed by PET / CT scans as per standard lugano criteria.
EBV Related Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma|Primary CNS Lymphoma|Primary Testicular Lymphoma
DRUG: Durvalumab|DRUG: Lenalidomide
Overall Response Rate, Overall response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of patients with reduction in tumor burden of at least 50%. ORR will be reported with corresponding 95% confidence intervals using the exact binomial method., at least 6 months of follow up
Progression free survival, Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from enrolment to progression or death due to any cause., 12 months|Overall Survival, Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from registration to death due to any cause., 2 years
This is a multi-center, open-label, phase II study of Durvalumab in combination with Lenalidomide for treatment of relapsed/refractory EBV associated DLBCL subtypes, primary testicular lymphoma and primary CNS lymphoma using a Simon's Two-stage Minimax design. Simon's two-stage Minimax design will be used to investigate if the overall response rate (ORR) is at least 45% against a no-interest ORR of 20%.

In the first stage, 13 patients will be accrued. If there are 2 or fewer responses in these 13 patients, the study will be stopped. Otherwise, 8 additional patients will be accrued for a total of 21 patients.This design yields a type I error rate of 5% and power of 80% when the true response rate is 45%.
