Trial of Mistletoe Extract in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This study will seek to determine the safety and toxicity profile as well as the maximum tolerated dose of Helixor速 M in patients with advanced solid tumors.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: Helixor速 M
Number of participants experiencing toxicities, Number of participants who experience side effects, 3 years|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), The highest dose that does not cause unacceptable side effects, 2 years
Tumor marker kinetics, Changes in disease specific bio markers: analyzed as percent change and presented in a waterfall plot of response., 3 years
This study is a Phase I study that consists of two phases: a dose escalation phase and an expansion phase. The dose escalation phase will be used to evaluate the safety and toxicity of Helixor速 M (mistletoe extract). An accelerated titration design (ATD) will be utilized to determine the MTD. The expansion phase will be used to obtain preliminary efficacy data about Helixor速 M.
