A Pilot Study of Perioperative Nivolumab and Paricalcitol to Target the Microenvironment in Resectable Pancreatic Cancer
The main purpose of this study is to look at the potential effects of paricalcitol (a drug similar to vitamin D) and nivolumab on pancreatic tumors in patients who are treated with gemcitabine and abraxane. The study will also look at the safety of including paricalcitol and nivolumab as part of the gemcitabine and abraxane chemotherapeutic regimen.
Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: Nab-Paclitaxel|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Paricalcitol
Number of Adverse Events, An adverse event (AE) was defined as any unfavorable symptom, sign, illness or experience that occurs at any dose and develops or worsens in severity during the course of the study. AEs were graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0., 18 months
Objective Response Rate, Objective response rate by RECIST v 1.1 after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Objective Response (OR) = CR + PR., 3 months|Progression-free Survival, Proportion of patients alive without progression 1 year from the start of study therapy, 1 year|Proportion of Patients Undergoing Surgery, Proportion of patients who underwent surgical resection after receiving neoadjuvant therapy, 3 months|Overall Survival, Overall survival 1 year after the initiation of study therapy, 1 year|Proportion of Margin Negative Surgical Resections, Proportion of patients undergoing surgical resection with surgical margins uninvolved by tumor, 3 months
