Methylation Level of SHOX2 in Endobronchial Ultrasound With Real-time Guided Transbronchial Needle Aspiration for Lung Cancer Staging
A DNA hypermethylation of the gene locus SHOX2 can be frequently found in lung cancer tissue. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the assessment of the hypermethylation level of SHOX2 in specimens obtained by endosonographic guided bronchoscopy makes a contribution to lung cancer staging.
