Efficacy and Safety of Neoadjuvant Nivolumab Plus SOX Versus Nivolumab Plus FLOT in Patients With HER2-negative Gastric and Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma
The goal of the study is to learn about Safety and efficacy of preoperative adjuvant SOX regimen combined with nivolumab versus FLOT Regimen with nivolumab in HER2-negative Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma. The main question it aims to answer are:

* Safety and efficacy of preoperative adjuvant SOX regimen combined with nivolumab versus FLOT regimen with nivolumab for the treatment of HER2-negative Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma.
* Disease-free survival of preoperative adjuvant SOX plus nivolumab and FLOT plus nivolumab for HER2-negative Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma.

Participants will be divided into two groups to use a FLOT chemotherapy regimen plus nivolumab (one group) and a SOX chemotherapy regimen plus nivolumab (another group). Researchers would compare tumor regression grade, adverse effects and survival benefit of two neoadjuvant regimens.
Immune-related Adverse Event|Chemotherapeutic Toxicity|Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma
adverse event, adverse event caused by FLOT, SOX or nivolumab treatment, which were coded using the Medical Dictionary Regulatory Activities version 20.1 and adverse event grade according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, From the preoperative chemotherapy until the occurrence of adverse events, assessed up to 180 days
tumor regression grade, Residual tumor components in post-radiotherapy samples and the proportion of fibrosis, From the surgery to evaluation of tumor regression grade, assessed up to 1 week|disease-free survival, from diagnosis to recurrence or death, From date of diagnosis until the first documented recurrence or death, assessed up to 120 months|objective response rate, objective response rate defined as the proportion of patients with a complete response or partial response to treatment according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)., From the surgery to evaluation of objective response rate, assessed up to 1 week|Duration of response, Duration of response, From the first assessment of the tumor as CR or PR to the first assessment of PD (Progressive Disease) or death from any cause, assessed up to 120 months.
