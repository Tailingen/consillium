Multicenter Study on Laparoscopic Distal Subtotal Gastrectomy for Advanced Gastric Cancer (CLASS-01)
* Laparoscopic distal subtotal gastrectomy with lymph node dissection as minimally invasive surgery has gained popularity for the treatment of early gastric cancer in East Asian countries, even though the long-term follow-up outcome based on multicenter randomized clinical trial (RCT) is still awaited.
* For the patient with locally advanced gastric cancer, several studies indicated that laparoscopic distal subtotal gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy is a technically feasible and safe procedure by experienced surgeons in high-volume specialized hospitals. However, the application of it is controversial mainly due to lack of solid evidence on the oncologic efficacy. Therefore, conventional open approach is still the current standard for advanced gastric cancer.
* Nowadays, the proportion of patients with locally advanced gastric cancer is estimated up to 80 per cent of all gastric cancer cases in China. Before the clinical application of laparoscopic procedure for the treatment with curative intent to advanced gastric cancer located at the middle- or lower-third of the stomach, the oncologic efficacy must be verified.
* Accordingly,the comparison of intraoperative and postoperative complications between laparoscopic and open distal subtotal gastrectomy for over 65 years old patients with gastric cancer based on a randomized controlled trial is needed.
Stomach Neoplasms
PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic gastrectomy|PROCEDURE: Open gastrectomy
3-year disease free survival rate, 36 months
Morbidity and mortality, The early postoperative complication and mortality are defined as the event observed within 30 days after surgery, while the time frame for late complication is the period from postoperative day 31th to the end of month 36th., 30 days; 36 months|3-year overall survival rate, 36 months|3-year recurrence pattern, Recurrence patterns are classified into five categories at the time of first diagnosis: locoregional, hematogenous, peritoneal, distant lymph node, and mixed type., 36 months|Postoperative recovery course, * Time to first ambulation, flatus, liquid diet, soft diet, and duration of hospital stay are used to assess the postoperative recovery course.
* The amount of abdominal drainage and blood transfusion are also recorded., 10 days|Inflammatory and immune response, The daily highest body temperature before discharge and the values of white blood cell count, hemoglobin, C-reactive protein, prealbumin and relevant immune cytokines including IL-6, T cell count, T-helper lymphocytes (CD4+) count, T-suppressor lymphocytes (CD8+) count, natural killer (NK) cells count, B-lymphocytes count, and TNF-Î± from peripheral blood before operation and on postoperative day 1, 3, 5 are recorded., 7 days
