Efficacy of Angiographic Embolization vs Non-embolization of Moderate/Poor Vascularized Vertebral Metastases on Intraoperative Bleeding During Surgery Decompression and Vertebral Stabilization.
Although angiographic embolization has been introduced for preoperative management of spine metastases in 1975 and is suggested today by many authors in the management of such pathologies, it needs to be confirmed by RCT. It is a minimally invasive procedure, not free from complications. The recent meta-analyzes, due to the limited number of patients included are not exhaustive about the effectiveness of embolization in the reduction of the intraoperative bleeding, especially in the context of poor / moderate metastasis vascularization. We want to evaluate the efficacy of preoperative angiographic embolization of intermediate / poor vascularized spine metastases in reducing intraoperative blood loss during excision surgery.
Spine Metastasis|Early Goal Directed Therapy|Embolization, Therapeutic|Blood Loss
PROCEDURE: Embolization
Intraoperative blood loss, volume (ml) of intraoperative blood loss volume aspirated from operative field (ml) + differential weight gauze at the end of surgery - dry gauze weight with 1g blood conversion = 0.948ml, during procedure
Concentration of Hemoglobin pre / post-operative, 24 hours|volume of transfused blood (ml), intraoperatively|Correlation between primary tumor and vascularization, during angiographic procedure|correlation between the type of primary tumor and blood losses, 24 hours|technical evaluation of the final result of embolization (total - 100%, subtotal 90-80% and partial 70-50%) in relation to blood losses, during angiographic procedure|evaluation of operative time, from incision to end of suture, during procedure|incidence of complications related to transfusions;, during hospitalization|duration of the hospitalization in ICU, during hospitalization
