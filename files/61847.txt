Advanced Cancer|Metastatic Cancer|Malignant Neoplastic Disease
DRUG: MRTX849|DRUG: TNO155
Characterize the safety of MRTX849 and TNO155 in patients having advanced solid tumor malignancies with KRAS G12C mutation., Number of participants with treatment related adverse events, 20 months|Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of MRTX849 and TNO155, Blood plasma concentration, 20 months
Establish maximum tolerated dose, Number of participants with dose limiting toxicity, 12 months|Evaluate clinical activity of MRTX849, Objective response rate in accordance with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), 20 months
This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, metabolites, pharmacodynamics, and clinical activity of MRTX849 in combination with TNO155 in patients with advanced solid tumors with a KRAS G12C mutation. MRTX849 is an orally available small molecule inhibitor of KRAS G12C and TNO155 is a selective, orally bioavailable allosteric inhibitor of wild-type SHP2.

This study was terminated prior to phase 2 initiating. Only phase 1 of the study was conducted.
