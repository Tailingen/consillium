HF50 in HER-2 Positive and Low-expression Advanced Solid Tumors
This is an open-label, single-arm, non-randomized, single-center, dose-escalation study designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of HF50 in patients with HER-2 positive and HER-2 low-expression advanced solid tumors. The primary objectives are to assess the safety, tolerability, and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of HF50. Secondary objectives include evaluating the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile and preliminary antitumor activity of HF50.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: HF50
Number of Participants with Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT), The number of participants experiencing dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) during the DLT evaluation period to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)., 28 days after the first dose (C1D1) for each dose cohort.|Incidence of Adverse Events (AEs), The number and percentage of participants experiencing adverse events (AEs), graded according to NCI-CTCAE v5.0, From first dose to 28 days after the last dose.|Incidence of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), The number and percentage of participants experiencing adverse events (AEs), graded according to NCI-CTCAE v5.0., From first dose to 28 days after the last dose.|Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) of HF50, RP2D will be determined based on safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics data collected during the dose escalation phase., At the end of dose escalation (assessed up to 1 year)|Incidence of Vital Sign Abnormalities, Number of participants who experienced a maximum severity of Grade 3 or higher post-baseline vital sign abnormality, including blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature.

Abnormalities will be graded according to National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0., From first dose to the end of the study (assessed up to 1 year)|Incidence of Echocardiography (ECHO) Abnormalities, Number of participants who experienced an abnormal echocardiography finding post-baseline, including changes in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), chamber size abnormalities, or valvular dysfunction. Abnormalities will be graded according to CTCAE v5.0., From first dose to the end of the study (assessed up to 1 year)
