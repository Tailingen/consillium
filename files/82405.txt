NBI Combined With MRI to Guide CTV Optimization in Eccentric Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
This is a prospective, single-center clinical trial in eccentric nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NBI combined with MRI-guided optimized CTV compared with conventional CTV, and to compare the radiotherapy-related adverse events and quality of life between the two groups.
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma by AJCC V8 Stage
RADIATION: CTV optimized IMRT
Acute adverse reactions, The acute adverse reactions of patients during or after radiotherapy were evaluated with the corresponding standard scales., 3 months|Control rate of non-irradiated area, 36 months
Local recurrence-free survival(LRFS), The duration of time to LRFS was calculated from the date of histological diagnosis until documented treatment local failure or death from any cause., 36 months|Progress-free survival(PFS), Defined as time from randomization to locoregional or distant metastasis relapse or death from any cause, whichever occurred first., 36 months|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival is measured from day of diagnosis until death due to any cause or the latest known date alive., 36 months
All patients with eccentric nasopharyngeal carcinoma were selected on the basis of MRI findings and NBI endoscopy was performed in these patients. The patients were enrolled if both NBI endoscopy and MRI showed eccentric NPC. Patients with contralateral tissue mucosal abnormalities detected by NBI and confirmed by biopsy were excluded. Then the patients were randomly divided into an experimental group (Optimized CTV) or a control group (Conventional CTV) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the two groups, as well as radiotherapy-related adverse events.
