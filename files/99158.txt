IX001 TCR-T In the Treatment of Advanced Pancreatic Cancer and Colorectal Cancer Induced by KRAS Mutations
This is a single-arm, single-center, open-label clinical study aimed at evaluating the safety and efficacy of IX001 TCR-T (T cell receptor-engineered T-Cell) injection in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer and colorectal cancer induced by KRAS (Kirsten Rat Sarcoma Viral Oncogene) mutations. A total of 6-18 evaluable patients are planned to be enrolled. The study will include 4 dose groups, using a '3+3' dose escalation design.
Pancreatic Cancer|Colorectal Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: IX001 TCR-T cells
Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLT), Proportion of patients with DLT, 4 weeks|Adverse Events (AEs), Incidence and severity of adverse events, 96 weeks|Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Incidence and severity of serious adverse events, 96 weeks
Objective Response Rate (ORR), The percentage of participants who achieved Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) based on RECIST version 1.1, 12 weeks|Disease Control Rate (DCR), The percentage of participants who achieved Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) or Stable disease (SD) based on RECIST version 1.1, 12 weeks|Changes in Serum Tumor Markers compared to Baseline, Changes of tumor markers in serum detected by immunofluorescence compared to baseline level, including carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and carbohydrate antigen 12-5 (CA12-5), 12 weeks|Duration of response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the first evaluation of a tumor as CR or PR to the first evaluation as PD or death from any cause, 96 weeks|Time to response (TTR), TTR is defined as the time between cell infusion and initial disease assessment as CR or PR, 96 weeks|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of cell infusion until the date of tumor progression or death from any cause, 96 weeks|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time between the date of cell infusion and the death of the patient for any reason, 96 weeks|TCR gene copies, TCR gene copies detected by qPCR in peripheral blood, 96 weeks|TCR-T cell counts, TCR-T cell counts detected by flow cytometry in peripheral blood, 96 weeks|Proportion of patients with anti-IX001 antibodies in peripheral blood, Anti-drug Antibodies, 96 weeks
Patients who sign the informed consent form will undergo screening based on inclusion/exclusion criteria. Eligible patients will be enrolled sequentially into dose group 1, dose group -1 or dose group 2, and dose group 3. The procedure of this study is as follows:

(I) The collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be transported to the production workshop for the preparation of IX001. After confirming that IX001 is proved qualified, the investigator will decide whether to start pre-conditioning 5 days before IX001 infusion.

(II) TCR-T cells will be administered via intravenous infusion, and the cell infusion dose will be determined according to the requirements of dose escalation.

(III) Following TCR-T cell infusion, recombinant human interleukin-2 (IL-2) will be continuously injected to assist TCR-T cell growth.

(IV) After TCR-T cell infusion and IL-2 injection are completed, safety and efficacy follow-up visits will be conducted with the subjects until week 96 or until the subject prematurely withdraws from the study.
