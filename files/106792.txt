Investigation of the Performance of the Medical Device Dermalyser in Determining Melanoma Thickness Based on Dermoscopy Images
In Sweden, approximately 9,000 Swedes are affected by melanoma annually, and each year, 500 individuals die from metastatic melanoma. The prognosis for melanoma primarily depends on the thickness of the tumor at diagnosis. Melanomas that only grow in the epidermis and have not yet grown into the dermis are called melanoma in situ or pre-melanoma. These melanomas lack the potential to spread in the body. Melanomas that grow into the dermis, on the other hand, are called invasive or malignant melanomas. Invasive melanomas have the potential to spread in the body.

To improve melanoma diagnostics, a dermatoscope is used. A dermatoscope is a type of magnifying glass equipped with a strong light. Using a dermatoscope makes the structures in the epidermis and dermis clearer. Although most melanomas are relatively easy to detect, it is often difficult to determine whether melanomas are invasive or in situ based on the dermatoscopic image. Despite the fact that all suspected melanomas (regardless of melanoma depth) should be operated on, it is important to form an opinion on whether the melanoma is invasive or in situ. This decision is important because it:

1. Provides guidance on how quickly healthcare must prioritize a patient for surgery.
2. Provides guidance on the margin the surgeon chooses for the first operation.
3. Affects the information we give the patient even before the first operation.

In recent years, several applications of machine learning have shown great potential in research contexts within dermatology and venereology. However, these tools have been evaluated to a very limited extent in clinical trials, which is naturally a prerequisite before they can be safely implemented in routine healthcare.
Melanoma (Skin Cancer)
DEVICE: Medical Device Dermalyser
Area under the curve (AUC) for discrimination between invansive and in situ melanoma for the "in distribution data set"., Please note that preoperatively there will still be uncertainty if an included lesion will be histopathologically verified as a melanoma. After histopathological analysis all lesions will be separated into an "in distrubution data set", i.e. lesions that were confirmed as melanomas and an "out-of distribution set", i.e., lesions that proved to have an alternative diagnosis.

Please note that the primary outcome measure will be limited the "in distrubution data set", i.e., lesions that turned out to be a melanoma. Image analysis with the help of AI tool Dermalyser in a prospective setting., From enrollment to the end of the inclusion when the images of the lesion have been obtained. This will most often be achieved on the same day as that the patient is included in the study.
Sensitivity and Specificity, Please note that preoperatively there will still be uncertainty if an included lesion will be histopathologically verified as a melanoma. After histopathological analysis all lesions will be separated into an "in distrubution data set", i.e. lesions that were confirmed as melanomas and an "out-of distribution set", i.e., lesions that proved to have an alternative diagnosis.

Algorithmic and physicians assessment of the "out of distribution set", Please note that preoperatively there will still be uncertainty if an included lesion will be histopathologically verified as a melanoma. After histopathological analysis all lesions will be separated into an "in distrubution data set", i.e. lesions that were confirmed as melanomas and an "out-of distribution set", i.e., lesions that proved to have an alternative diagnosis. Please note that this pre-specified outcome will be limited the "out of distrubution data set", i.e., lesions that turned out not to be a melanoma. Image analysis with the help of AI tool Dermalyser in a prospective setting., From enrollment to the end of the inclusion when the images of the lesion have been obtained.
