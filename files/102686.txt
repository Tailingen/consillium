Donor Lymphocyte Infusion in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Persistent Hematologic Cancer After Donor Stem Cell Transplant
RATIONALE: Giving an infusion of donor lymphocytes may be able to kill cancer cells in patients with hematologic cancer that has come back after a donor stem cell transplant.

PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well donor lymphocyte infusion works in treating patients with recurrent or persistent hematologic cancer after donor stem cell transplant.
Leukemia|Lymphoma|Multiple Myeloma and Plasma Cell Neoplasm|Myelodysplastic Syndromes
BIOLOGICAL: donor lymphocytes
Complete Remission Rate, continued or induced complete remission after DLI, 100 days post DLI|Duration of Complete Response in Months (Maximum 12), For participants who achieve a complete remission after DLI, the duration of time until 1) relapse or 2) death in remission or 3) subsequent DLI or 4) last followup (at 1 year after DLI), 1 year post DLI
Acute Graft-versus-host Disease, development of grade III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) per Glucksberg criteria, 100 days post DLI
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine if the complete response rate exceeds 10% in patients with recurrent or persistent hematologic malignancies treated with donor lymphocyte infusion.

Secondary

* Estimate the complete response rate in these patients.
* Assess the toxicity of donor lymphocyte infusion in these patients.

OUTLINE: Patients receive up to four donor lymphocyte infusions at least 1 month apart in the absence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or uncontrolled graft-versus-host disease.
