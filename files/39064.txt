Tomosynthesis Vs. Contrast-Enhanced Mammography in Women with Personal History of Breast Cancer in Western Pennsylvania
This is a prospective clinical trial that will examine if contrast-enhanced mammography substantially improves breast cancer detection compared to mammography with tomosynthesis, with minimal increase in false-positives, in women with a personal history of breast cancer.

DEVICE: Contrast-enhanced mammogram
Cancer Detection, Number of participants with cancer detected with contrast-enhanced mammography compared to tomosynthesis. Number of patients recalled for additional testing by each imaging test who do not have cancer (false positives). Outcomes will be assessed for both prevalence and incidence screens., 48 months
Reader Validation, Reader validation will be performed at study conclusion: number of cancers detected with contrast-enhanced mammography or tomosynthesis., 48 months
The investigators expect to show in a prospective clinical trial that, in women with a personal history of breast cancer, contrast-enhanced mammography substantially improves breast cancer detection compared to mammography with tomosynthesis, with minimal increase in false positives. The investigators expect a substantial increase in node-negative invasive cancers in particular. Because DBT will be interpreted first by one reader, and CEM will be interpreted first, and independently, by a second reader, there will also be an assessment of performance of tomosynthesis alone or CEM alone in this population. Participants will be invited to three rounds of annual screening with CEM. CEM must be performed at the time of or within 6 weeks of routine annual mammogram with tomosynthesis.
