Study of Enzastaurin With 5-Fluorouracil/Leucovorin (5-FU/LV) Plus Bevacizumab as Maintenance Regimen Following First Line Therapy for Metastatic Colon Cancer
This study will evaluate the addition of enzastaurin to 5-FU (5-fluorouracil)/LV (leucovorin) plus bevacizumab in the maintenance of best response obtained with 6 cycles of first-line therapy consisting of 5-FU/LV + oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) or 5-FU/LV + irinotecan (FOLFIRI), plus bevacizumab in patients with Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.
Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Enzastaurin|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Leucovorin (LV)|DRUG: 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)|DRUG: Bevacizumab (Bev)
Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first observation of disease progression or death due to any cause. Progressive disease was determined using a modified version of Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) Assessment and was defined as at least a 20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions. Time to disease progression was censored at the date of death if death was due to other cause., Randomization to measured progressive disease or death up to 17.2 months
Overall Survival (OS), OS was the duration from enrollment to death due to any cause. For participants who are alive, OS is censored at the last contact., Randomization up to 22.8 months|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), A summary of serious and all other non-serious AEs is located in the Reported Adverse Event module., Randomization up to 17.2 months|Overall Survival (OS) From Start of First Line Therapy, OS was the duration from first line therapy to death due to any cause. For participants who are alive, OS is censored at the last contact., Start of first line therapy (approximately 3 months prior to randomization) to date of death from any cause up to 27 months post randomization|PFS From Start of First Line Therapy, PFS was defined as the time from first line therapy to the first observation of disease progression or death due to any cause. Progressive disease was determined using a modified version of RECIST Assessment and was defined as at least a 20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions. Time to disease progression was censored at the date of death if death was due to other cause., Start of first line therapy to measured progressive disease or death up to 24 months
