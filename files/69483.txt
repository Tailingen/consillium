A Study of a Fully Human BCMA-targeting CAR (CT103A) Combined With Selinexor in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Extramedullary Multiple Myeloma
This study is a single-center, open Phase I study, to observe the effectiveness and safety of CT103A combined with different doses of Selinexor in patients with relapsed/refractory extramedullary multiple myeloma, and the pharmacokinetics of Selinexor and CT103A Kinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics.
Extramedullary Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Selinexor|DRUG: CT103A
Progression-free survival (PFS), The time from the start of CT103A treatment for the subjects to the first disease progression or death for any reason., 1 year post CT103A infusion|Objective response rate (ORR), The percentage of subjects who achieved sCR、CR、VGPR、PR., 1 year post CT103A infusion|Duration of response (DOR) after administration, DOR will be calculated among responders (with a PR or better response) from the date of initial documentation of a response (PR or better) to the date of first documented evidence of progressive disease, as defined in the IMWG criteria, 1 year post CT103A infusion
Overall survival (OS), OS is measured from the date of the initial infusion of CT103A to the date of the participant's death., 1 year post CT103A infusion|Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) efficacy evaluation, MRD evaluation according to IMWG, including the proportion of subjects who achieved MRD negative and the duration of MRD negative., 1 year post CT103A infusion|Type and incidence of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) by dose group, Calculate type and incidence of adverse events (AE), serious adverse event (SAE), including those happened after lymphodepletion and after infusion, those related to study drug and lymphodepletion, or those that led to withdrawal from the study. They will also be aggregated by systematic organ classification (SOC), preferred term (PT), and severity, 1 year post CT103A infusion|Pharmacokinetics - Cmax of CT103A, The maximum transgene level at Cmax fo CT103A, 1 year post CT103A infusion|Pharmacokinetics - Tmax of CT103A, The maximum transgene level at Tmax fo CT103A, 1 year post CT103A infusion|Pharmacokinetics - AUC0-28days of CT103A, Area under the curve of CT103A cells from time zero to Day 28 of CT103A, 1 year post CT103A infusion|Pharmacokinetics - AUC0-90days of CT103A, Area under the curve of CT103A cells from time zero to Day 90 of CT103A, 1 year post CT103A infusion|Pharmacokinetics of Selinexor, The changes of concentration of Selinexor in peripheral blood will be assessed., 1 year post CT103A infusion|PD endpoints, The concentration levels of CAR-T-related serum cytokines such as Ferritin and IL-6, 1 year post CT103A infusion|Health-related quality of life assessment, HRQoL will be assessed by the European Organization for Cancer Research and Treatment Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-C30), 1 year post CT103A infusion|Appraisal of life quality, Appraisal of life quality of the subjects will be assessed by the Quality of Life Multiple Myeloma Module Questionnaire (QLQ-MY20), 1 year post CAR-T cell infusion|Evaluation of lymphocyte subsets, Lymphocyte subsets will be assessed by FACS, 1 year post CAR-T cell infusion|Concentration of immunoglobulins, The levels of Immunoglobulins in peripheral blood will be assessed to monitor changes at each time point, 1 year post CAR-T cell infusion
In this study, two dose groups of 20 mg/week and 40 mg/week will be set for Selinexor, and the dose of CT103A is 1.0×106 cells/Kg. Subjects in all dose groups will firstly receive a single dose infusion of CT103A, at least 1 month post infusion and platelet recovery to ≥50×109/L. Then subjects began to take Selinexor once a week for one year. Each dose group level will include 8-10 subjects, and a total of 16-20 subjects are expected to be enrolled.
