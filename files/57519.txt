A Clinical Study of Docetaxel for Injection (Albumin-bound) in Patients With Gastric Cancer
This trial is a multicenter, randomized, controlled phase ле clinical study of comparison of Docetaxel for Injection (Albumin-bound) and Taxotere in locally advanced or metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma with previous first-line treatment failure.

About 630 patients with locally advanced or metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma or gastric esophageal junction adenocarcinoma will be randomly assigned to the test group or the control group. All patients will receive Docetaxel for injection (Albumin-bound) or Taxotere for treatment until disease progression. Regular visits and imaging examinations will be conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of the two groups.
