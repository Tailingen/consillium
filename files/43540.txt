Pemetrexed and Gemcitabine in Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This study is designed to study the role of an active and well-tolerated non-platinum agent, gemcitabine, in a combination regimen with pemetrexed in the first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC. This study will serve to define the role of next generation agents in a new combination regimen in the treatment of advanced NSCLC. This combination regimen may ultimately be important in further expanding treatment options for patients while improving survival, quality of life, and symptom control compared with platinum-based combination regimens - and with acceptable toxicity.

DRUG: Pemetrexed|DRUG: Gemcitabine
Overall Response Rate, Overall response rate is the percentage of patients with complete response or partial response per RECIST v.1 Criteria. Complete response (CR) = Disappearance of all target lesions, disappearance of all nontarget lesions for at least 4 weeks. Partial Response (PR) = At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of longest diameters., 18 months
Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the interval between the start date of treatment and the date of occurrence of progressive disease or death from any cause., 18 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS was measured from the date of study entry until the date of death., 18 months
Upon determination of eligibility, patients will be receive:

* Pemetrexed + Gemcitabine
