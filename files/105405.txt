Butorphanol in Pain Following Ablation for Hepatic Tumor
The objective of this investigation was to evaluate the influence of Butorphanol on postoperative pain mitigation in patients undergoing microwave ablation for hepatic tumor. Employing a rigorously designed multicentral, randomized, and placebo-controlled format, patients subjected to microwave ablation were assigned randomly to either Butorphanol (experimental group) or normal saline (control group). Primary outcomes encompassed intraoperative pain levels assessed through patient-driven evaluation utilizing a 10-point visual analog scale (VAS). Secondary outcomes included postoperative pain levels at the 6-hour mark (VAS) and comprehensive pain assessment outcomes.
