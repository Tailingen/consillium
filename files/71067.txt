Myasthenia Gravis and Psyche
The purpose of the study is to systematically capture and characterize mental comorbidities for patients with myasthenia gravis. Anxiety disorders and depression for example, can negatively affect the quality of life and lead to e.g. unemployment and early retirement especially in young patients.

Additionally the researchers want to find out in what way certain aspects of the disease have an influence on the quality of life, and whether different concepts of coping with the disease have different effects on the quality of life for patients with myasthenia gravis.

During the study, close relatives of patients will also be asked to provide input about their current stress situation in the context of supporting their relative.

Based on the results, the investigators want to improve and supplement established treatment concepts, to ensure a more comprehensive and individual treatment.
