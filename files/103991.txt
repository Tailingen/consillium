GR-MD-02 + Pembrolizumab Versus Pembrolizumab Monotherapy in Melanoma and Squamous Cell Head and Neck Cancer Patients
The purpose of this study is to test the safety \& efficacy of combination drugs versus placebo to treat metastatic melanoma and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.
Metastatic Melanoma|Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: GR-MD-02|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Overall response rate based on disease imaging, Determine the objective response of GR-MD-02 + pembrolizumab versus pembrolizumab monotherapy in patients with advanced MM or HNSCC, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression, assessed up to 63 weeks.
Evaluation of GAL-3 expression, Compare GAL-3 expression in paired biopsies after GR-MD-02 + pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab monotherapy., Screening and Day 68|Evaluation of predictive biomarker, Characterize MDSC expression over time as a predictive biomarker of response after GRMD02 + pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab monotherapy, Day 85|Frequency of Immune-mediated adverse events, Compare the frequency of immune-mediated adverse events after GR-MD-02 + pembrolizumab versus pembrolizumab + placebo, From time of informed consent to week 63|Evaluation of antiviral immunity, Assess the biological activity of GR-MD-02 + pembrolizumab and in comparison to pembrolizumab monotherapy by measuring CD4+T cells with a memory phenotype (CD3+CD4+Ki67+CD25+FoxP3-CCR7-CD45RA-CD27+CD28+/-)., Day 85|Evaluation of antiviral immunity, Assess the biological activity of GR-MD-02 + pembrolizumab and in comparison to pembrolizumab monotherapy by measuring CD8+ T cells with effector phenotype (CD3+CD8+CD28-CD95+)., Day 85|Evaluation of antiviral immunity, Assess the biological activity of GR-MD-02 + pembrolizumab and in comparison to pembrolizumab monotherapy by measuring tumor-specific T cells using autologous and/or HLA-matched tumor when available., Day 85
Eligible patients will be registered, stratified by diagnosis (melanoma versus OHN cancer), and the number of prior systemic therapies, and randomized to receive either GR-MD-02 + pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab + placebo.

In addition to monitoring for toxicity and clinical response, blood and tumor samples will be obtained to assess immunologic measures relevant to galectin biology and pembrolizumab T-cell checkpoint inhibition.
