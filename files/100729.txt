Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma|Cervical Carcinoma|Esophageal Carcinoma|Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma|Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma
BIOLOGICAL: CTX131
Phase 1 (Dose Escalation): Incidence of adverse events, Defined as dose-limiting toxicities, From CTX131 infusion up to 28 days post-infusion|Phase 2 (Cohort Expansion): Objective response rate (ORR), ORR based on Independent Review Committee (IRC) assessment, defined as the proportion of subjects who have achieved a best overall response of CR or PR according to appropriate response evaluation criteria for each disease histology, From CTX131 infusion up to 60 months post-infusion
An open-label, multi-center Phase 1/2 study of CTX131 in subjects with relapsed/refractory solid tumors. CTX131 is an is allogeneic CD70- directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell immunotherapy comprised of allogeneic T cells that are genetically modified ex vivo using CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/ CRISPR associated protein 9) gene editing components (single guide RNA and Cas9 nuclease).
