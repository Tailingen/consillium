Fluoroscopic &Ultrasonographic Guidance of Superior Hypogastric Plexus Neurolysis in Intractable Pelvic Pain
fluoroscopic group \& includes 30 patients where SHPB will be done Fluoroscopic-guided (the posterior oblique trajectory technique.the double modality group \& includes 30 patients where SHPB will be done using our described new technique of performing the modified Mishra technique by injecting 3-5 ml of contrast media (lohexol=omnipaque) after getting the target position.
Intractable Pelvic Cancer Pain
PROCEDURE: fluroscopic guided block|PROCEDURE: double modality (ultrasound and fluroscopic) guided block
pain relief will be assessed by VAS, pain relief will be assessed by VAS (visual Analogue score) which is 100 mscale with left (0) end means no pain \& right (10) end means the worst possible pain, 12 weeks
