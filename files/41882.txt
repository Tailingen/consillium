Incidence of POPF in the Resection of the Left Pancreas With RFAT
This study evaluates the impact of the Radiofrequency assisted transection on the rate of postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) after performing distal pancreatectomies, central pancreatectomies and pancreatic enucleation

Postoperative pancreatic fistula according the 2016 update of the International Study Group (ISGPS), "Grade A postoperative pancreatic fistula" is now redefined and called a "biochemical leak," because it has no clinical importance and is no longer referred to a true pancreatic fistula. Postoperative pancreatic fistula grades B and C are confirmed but defined more strictly. In particular, grade B requires a change in the postoperative management; drains are either left in place \>3 weeks or repositioned through endoscopic or percutaneous procedures. Grade C postoperative pancreatic fistula refers to those postoperative pancreatic fistula that require reoperation or lead to single or multiple organ failure and/or mortality attributable to the pancreatic fistula., 1 month

Among the different methods for sealing the remaining pancreas, resection and sealing devices assisted by radiofrequency energy (RF) have been used, both in experimental studies and in clinical trials, in order to try to reduce the POPF rate. One of these devices is the Coolinside®, which is approved for this indication and is currently used in selected cases, at the Hospital del Mar, among other centers.

Although there are several published studies based on similar technology, the existing publications on the use of Coolinside® in the pancreas have been made in rat and pig animal models. In particular, the most recent study published by Dorcaratto et al. compares the Coolinside device vs. the mechanical stapler in porcine model when performing distal pancreatectomies. The results suggest that the Coolinside device was more efficient in the control of the POPF than the stapler with a POPF index of 12% vs. 36%.

Therefore, this study aims to obtain more clinical evidence about the use of Coolinside in pancreatic resections within a clinical context.
