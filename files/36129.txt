Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Patients With Clinical Stage III Rectal Cancer Undergoing Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with clinical stage III rectal cancer who received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy on the basis of postoperative pathological stage.
Rectal Neoplasms
DRUG: Capecitabine|DRUG: mFOLFOX6 or CAPOX
Disease free survival, Calculated from the date of surgery to the date of recurrence, 3-year
Overall survival, Calculated from the date of diagnosis to the date of death from any cause, 3-year, 5-year|Disease free survival, Calculated from the date of surgery to the date of recurrence, 5-year|The rate of local recurrence, The ratio of the number of local recurrence to the total patients, 3-year|The rate of adverse events resulted from chemotherapy, The ratio of the number of patients experienced adverse events to the total patients, 3-year|The quality of life postoperatively, The European Organization for Research and Treatment (EORTC)-QLQ-C30 HRQL questionnaire was assessed with repeated measures at regular intervals postoperatively at months 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24, 3-month, 6-month, 9-month, 12-month, 18-month, 24-month
Previous studies have proved that neoadjuvant radiotherapy can decrease the rate of local recurrence rather than distal metastases in advanced rectal cancer. Moreover, the local control was not responsible for survival benefit. Adjuvant chemotherapy is capable of eliminating the micrometastasis, rendering better prognosis to rectal cancer. However, the application of adjuvant chemotherapy depends largely on the evidence from colon cancer. At present, controversy remains on the clinical value of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with rectal cancer who received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Besides that, the pathological stage followed by neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy may have an effect on the evaluation of adjuvant chemotherapy. According to the postoperative pathological stage, the present study was designed as a non-inferiority trail for patients with pathological complete response or yp stage I to compare the long-term outcomes of observational group and those receiving 5-fluorouracil. For patients with yp stage II or III, the study aims to compare the effect of oxaliplatin combined with 5-fluorouracil and 5-fluorouracil alone.
