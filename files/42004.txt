Radiofrequency Versus Laser Ablation for Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to prospectively compare percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) versus percutaneous laser ablation (LA) for the treatment of small hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with cirrhosis.
Carcinoma, Hepatocellular|Neoplasms, Liver
PROCEDURE: percutaneous radiofrequency ablation|PROCEDURE: percutaneous laser ablation
Tumor response, Complete ablation of the HCC nodule, defined as absence of contrast enhancement of the nodule at CT or MRI imaging, four weeks after treatment
overall survival, Time from randomization to death. Patients alive at the end of follow-up are censored., 12 months after last treatment|time to local recurrence, the time from complete tumor ablation to reappearance of arterial enhancement on CT or MRI either within a treated tumor or near its borders, 12 months after treatment
Percutaneous ablation is a safe and effective therapy for cirrhotic patients with HCC when resection or liver transplantation is not possible. Among the various percutaneous local ablative therapies, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has attracted the greatest interest because of its effectiveness and safety for single HCC ≤ 5.0cm or ≤3 HCC nodules ≤3cm. Some studies have shown that laser ablation (LA) may be as effective as RFA in the treatment of HCC. However, RFA and LA are different techniques and, in different cases (for example: size or site of HCC nodule), each of these procedures may have some advantages or disadvantages. Therefore there is the need for a prospective randomized controlled study to compare RFA and LA in patients with small HCC.
