A Phase 1 Study of BST02 in Treating Locally Advanced Liver Cancer
The goal of this clinical trial is to investigate the BST02, a tumor infiltrating lymphocyte product, collected from the locally advanced liver cancer subjects

The main questions it aims to answer are:

1. Safety and tolerability of BST02.
2. Preliminary efficacy of BST02. Participants will receive a cytoreductive surgery to collect samples for the manufacture of BST02.

Participants will receive BST02 infusion followed by IL-2 infusion. Blood samples will be collected for the analysis of PK and safety.
Locally Advanced Liver Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: BST02
Occurence and incidence of adverse event and severe adverse events., The occurrence and incidence (%) of Adverse Events (AEs) as well as Severe Adverse Events (SAEs) after infusion of BST02 for subjects in each dosing group, From the infusion (D0) to D28|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT), The highest dose which the patients can tolerate, and the occurence of DLT events., From the infusion (D0) to D28
Tumor response and survival., Including following outcomes: Objective Response Rate (ORR), Disease Control Rate (DCR), Time to Response (TTR), Duration of Response (DOR), Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Overall Survival (OS). The tumor responses are judged according to mRECIST criteria., From the infusion (D0) to D672 (2 years)|PK parameter collection, PK testing indicator for BST02: Peripheral blood CXCR3+CD8+ T-lymphocyte count., From before infusion (D-2) to D28
