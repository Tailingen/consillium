Collecting Ducts Carcinoma: in Depth Exploration and Biologically Driven Therapy (CICERONE)
* Collect a large number of samples with certain / suspected diagnosis of collecting duct carcinoma in order to confirm the diagnosis (centralized review) and standardize according to WHO 2016 criteria
* Build an extensive tissue bank (DNA and RNA extraction) aimed at defining the molecular taxonomy of the tumor through 1) transcriptomic analysis 2) gene expression profile
* Define specific molecular signatures
