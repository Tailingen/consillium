Oncolytic Virotherapy Plus PD-1 Inhibitor and Lenvatinib for Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety/tolerability efficacy of oncolytic virotherapy combined with Tislelizumab plus lenvatinib for advanced pancreatic cancer patients who were relapsed or refractory to standard therapy
Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma

Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT), The DLT assessment period is defined as: Day of Injection through 28 days post injection (Safety Follow Up). A DLT will be defined as any Grade 3 or higher adverse event, as assessed by the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0., 28 days|Maximum tolerated dose, A MTD is determined if any cohort experiences 2 subjects with DLT's., 28 days|Adverse event (AE), max 24 months
Objective Response Rate, ORR according to RECIST 1.1, max 24 months|Duration of Response, max 24 months|Progression Free Survival, max 24 months|Overall survival, max 42 months|disease control rate, max 24 months
Recent studies have suggested that local destruction of tumor tissue by oncolytic virus induced activation and maturation of dendritic cells and tumor-specific T cells by cross-presentation of tumor antigens. While pd-1 blocking antibody interferes with PD-1 mediated T-cell regulatory signaling. And combination of pd-1 blocking antibody plus lenvatinib showed increased ORR in many types of human cancers. Therefore, the objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oncolytic virotherapy combined with Tislelizumab plus lenvatinib for advanced pancreatic cancer patients who were relapsed or refractory to standard therapy.
