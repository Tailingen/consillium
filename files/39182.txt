Screening for Early Lung Cancer in Shanghai, China
Imaging procedures including chest X-ray and low-dose computed tomography may be effective in lung cancer early detection. Yet it is unknown whether low-dose computed tomography combined with computer aided detection ï¼ˆCAD) is more effective than LDCT in screening of early lung cancer.
Lung Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Observer nodule detection|DEVICE: Computer-aided nodule detection
The sensitivities of low-dose computed tomography and low-dose computed tomography with computer aided detection in detecting early lung cancer, A questionaire will be recorded for each subject, including demographics, smoking history and disease history, etc. If a pulmonary nodule was found, the location, shape, size, margin and density will be recorded.

A subject with a suspected malignant nodule, which was detected either by a radiologist or computed-aiding detection software, will refer to a physician for further management.

Finally, the sensitivities of radiologist or software detection will be calculated., 24months
The false positive rates between low-dose computed tomography and low-dose computed tomography with computer aided detection will be compared, 24months|Nodule detection rate, 6 months
The randomized clinical trial is to investigate and compare the effectiveness of CAD-guided low-dose computed tomography and low-dose computed tomography in lung cancer screening for community individuals in Shanghai, China. Thus, an imaging protocol which can detect early lung cancer in asymptomatic high risk patients will be proposed.
