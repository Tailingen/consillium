Diagnostic Performance and Predictive Capacity of Immediate Urine Cytology After Transurethral Resection of Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer; A Prospective Study
The current study aimed at prospectively assessing the performance of IUC as a predictive tool for residual tumor after primary TURBT of NMIBC, and possible future recurrence.
Bladder Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: immediate urine cytology
Diagnostic performance of IUC, The primary outcome included assessment of the performance of IUC as a predictive tool for possible residual malignancy after primary TURBT. Thereafter, sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) and overall accuracy of IUC as a preliminary step before repeat TURBT will be determined., It was assessed 48 hours after primary TURBT
The secondary outcome included the evaluation of predictive capacity of IUC for tumor recurrence in the study participants., The secondary outcome included the evaluation of predictive capacity of IUC for tumor recurrence in the study participants., Within duration of follow up (4 years )
The current study aimed at prospectively assessing the performance of IUC as a predictive tool for residual tumor after primary TURBT of NMIBC, and possible future recurrence.
