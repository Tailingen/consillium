TWO DİFFERENT ELECTROSURGERY DEVICES AS MONOPOLAR HOOC AND PLASMAKINETIC BIPOLAR SPATULA EFFECTIVENESS DURING COLPOTOMY
WE DECIDED TO COMPARE TWO DIFFERENT ELECTROSURGERY DEVİCES TO PROVIDE COLPOTOMY. ONE OF THEM İS MONOPOLAR HOOC, THE OTHER DEVİCE İS PLASMAKİNETİC BİPOLAR SPATULA. WE WİLL RANDOMİSE PATİENTS FİRSTLY THEN COMPARE THE RESULTS SUCH, VAGİNAL DEHİSSENS, COLPOTOMY DURATİON, AMOUNT OF MIST DURING COLPOTOMY, AMOUNT OF BLEEDİNG.

VAGINAL DEHISSENS, AFTER LAPAROSCOPIC HYSTERECTOMY TWO DIFFERENT ELECTROSURGERY DEVICES RESULTS, 0 DAY-365 DAYS
COLPOTOMY IS A PROCESS DURING TOTAL LAPAROSCOPIC HYSTERECTOMY. WE CAN USE EİTHER ELECTROSURGERY INSTRUMENTS TO PROVIDE COLPOTOMY. IN OUR TRIAL WE WİLL RANDOMİSE PATİENTS FİRSTLY THEN COMPARE THE RESULTS SUCH, VAGİNAL DEHİSSENS, COLPOTOMY DURATİON, AMOUNT OF MIST DURING COLPOTOMY, AMOUNT OF BLEEDİNG.
