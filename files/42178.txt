Direct Tumor Injection KLH-Pulsed Dendritic Cells in Unresectable Pancreatic Cancer
This research study uses radiation or a gene therapy agent, TNFerade in addition to a dendritic cell vaccine in patients with locally advanced or low volume metastatic pancreatic cancer. The use of TNFerade or radiation serves to generate cell death stimulating the immune response. The dendritic cell vaccine may direct a distant and lasting effective anti-tumor immune response to achieve a local and systemic clinical benefit.
Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: KLH-pulsed autologous dendritic cell vaccine
Overall Survival, Patients will be followed until death
