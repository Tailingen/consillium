Assess Safety and Efficacy of Vilaprisan in Subjects With Uterine Fibroids (ASTEROID 4)
The primary objective of this study was to show superiority of vilaprisan in the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) in subjects with uterine fibroids compared to placebo

The secondary objectives of this study were to additionally evaluate the efficacy and safety of vilaprisan in subjects with uterine fibroids
Uterine Fibroids
DRUG: Vilaprisan (BAY1002670)|DRUG: Placebo
Number of Participants With Amenorrhea, Amenorrhea was defined as menstrual blood loss (MBL) \< 2 mL during the last 28 days of treatment. The evaluation of MBL was based on the Alkaline hematin (AH) method., The last 28 days of treatment period 1
Number of Participants With Heavy Menstrual Bleeding (HMB) Response, HMB was defined as MBL \<80.00 mL during the last 28 days of treatment and \>50% reduction compared to baseline (assessed by the AH method)., The last 28 days of treatment period 1 and treatment period 2|Time to Onset of Amenorrhea, Onset of amenorrhea was defined by the first day for which the MBL for all subsequent 28-day periods up to the end of a treatment period was \<2 mL (amenorrhea defined similar to primary endpoint and assessed by the AH method)., In treatment period 1 (12 weeks) and in treatment period 2 (12 weeks)|Time to Onset of Controlled Bleeding, Onset of controlled bleeding was defined by the first day for which the MBL for all subsequent 28-day periods up to the end of a treatment period was \<80.00 mL (assessed by the AH method)., In treatment period 1 (12 weeks) and in treatment period 2 (12 weeks)|Number of Participants With Absence of Bleeding (Spotting Allowed), Absence of bleeding was defined as no scheduled or unscheduled bleeding (spotting allowed) during the last 28 days of a treatment period based on subjects' daily responses to the UF-DBD (Uterine Fibroid Daily Bleeding Diary)., The last 28 days of treatment period 1 and treatment period 2|Number of Participants by Endometrial Biopsy Main Results (Majority Read, Main Diagnosis), Number of participants with endometrial histology findings, e.g. benign endometrium, malignant neoplasm, hyperplasia without atypia, hyperplasia with atypia and endometrial polyps., Up to 36 weeks|Change From Baseline of Endometrial Thickness, Ultrasound examinations were performed. Endometrial thickness was measured in the medio-sagittal section as double-layer in millimeters. Summary statistics for change from baseline in endometrial thickness was provided in below table., In treatment period 1 (12 weeks) and in treatment period 2 (12 weeks)
