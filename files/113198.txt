Newly Emerging Immunotherapy for Pancreatic Cancer Treatment
This is a Phase Ib/II platform clinical study to evaluate the initial efficacy and safety of different novel immunotherapies in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.

DRUG: JS001|DRUG: JS004|DRUG: JS007|DRUG: JS015|DRUG: Irinotecan Liposome Injection|DRUG: 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU)|DRUG: Leucovorin (LV)|DRUG: Nab paclitaxel|DRUG: Gemcitabine
Incidence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) (phase IB), If less than 2 participants developed DLT during the safety observation period (one cycle after the first dose), follow-up first-line D/E/F cohort exploration should be considered. Otherwise, it is up to the investigator to decide the next research plan., 21 days after the first dose was administered to each subject|Objective Response Rate (ORR) (phase II), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on RECIST 1.1., Up to 1 year
Objective Response Rate (ORR) (phase IB), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of CR or PR based on RECIST 1.1., Up to 1 year|Disease control rate (DCR), DCR was defined as the percentage of cases with remission (PR + CR) and stable lesions (SD) after treatment was assessable based on RECIST 1.1., Up to 1 year|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR will be calculated from the date of the first evaluation showing PR, or CR, to the date of the first disease progression or death, whichever comes first and based on RECIST 1.1., Up to 1 year|Progression free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the first dose until objective tumor progression(PD), or death, whichever comes first and based on RECIST 1.1. At the end of the study, the time of last acquisition of living patients without PD was taken as the deleted data., Up to 2 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS will be measured from the date of first dose to death from any cause., Up to 2 years|Number of Participants With Abnormal Laboratory Values and/or Adverse Events That Are Related to Treatment, Adverse event (AE), abnormal laboratory examination, serious adverse event (SAE) related with the study drug judged using NCI-CTCAE V5.0 by investigator., 90 days after the last administration
The cohort A/B/C included patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer who had previously failed at least first line gemcitabine-based system therapy.The cohort D/E/F included patients with previously untreated systemic pancreatic cancer with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer.This study plans to first explore A/B/C cohort, and then start the D/E/F cohort after determining the safety.
