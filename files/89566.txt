Decitabine in Treating Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of decitabine in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndrome.
Leukemia|Myelodysplastic Syndromes
DRUG: decitabine
OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (including chronic myelomonocytic leukemia) to decitabine.

OUTLINE: This is an open label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by disease (low risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) vs. high risk MDS vs. chronic myelomonocytic leukemia). Patients receive decitabine as a 4 hour infusion every 8 hours on days 1-3. Treatment continues every 6-8 weeks for 4-6 courses. Patients are followed at 6 and 12 months.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 75 patients will be accrued for this study over 1 year.
