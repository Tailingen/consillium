Malignant Rectal Neoplasm|Recurrent Tumor
RADIATION: intraoperative radiotherapy
clinical outcomes, locoregional control, progression-free and overall survival rates., 3-year
toxicities, Toxicity score criteria defined by Intraoperative Radiation Therapy Working Group Criteria, 3-6 monthly up to 30 months
Primary Outcome measures are 3-year locoregional control, progression-free and overall survival rates.

Secondary outcome measures are toxicities scores up to 3 months after surgery (acute) and greater than 3 months after surgery (late). Data collected at 3-6 month intervals for 30 months
