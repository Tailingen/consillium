ElastoMRI Evaluation of Hepatic Metastases in Colorectal Cancer ( MetaIRM)
Currently, the tumor response of operated colorectal liver metastases is assessed by histology of the resection specimen.The histological data make it possible to define categories (responder, partial responder, non-responder).

Overall survival (OS: overall survival) after surgery crucially depends on the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Current criteria for predicting histological response in preoperative imaging are not satisfactory.

The working hypothesis is that it is possible to better differentiate the tissue response to conventional chemotherapies and anti-angiogenics through MRI elastography by quantifying the changes in tissue mechanical properties induced by systemic treatments.

The objectives is to evaluate the mechanical properties obtained by elasto MRI according to the systemic treatments envisaged: conventional chemotherapy such as Folfox or combined with targeted therapy

This is an open, non-randomized, non-comparative trial with three parallel groups

* 10 patients immediately resectable and receiving preoperative chemotherapy based on Folfox alone.
* 30 potentially resectable patients (borderline) with two groups of patients representing the combinations usual triplets: chemotherapy and targeted therapy: Folfox+bevacizumab (15 patients) and Folfox + Cetuximab (15 patients).
* 10 unresectable patients with two groups of patients representing the usual combinations: cytotoxic pure vs cytotoxic + targeted therapy (bevacizumab or Cetuximab).
