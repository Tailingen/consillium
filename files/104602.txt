Study Comparing Imatinib With Chemotherapy as Induction in Elderly Patients With Philadelphia Positive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)
The aims of the study are to determine whether single agent imatinib (STI571; Glivec) is more effective as up-front remission induction therapy than conventional multi-agent induction chemotherapy for elderly patients with Philadelphia positive (Ph+)ALL, whether this treatment is better tolerated, and whether subsequent combination therapy with imatinib and chemotherapy of approximately a 1 year duration is tolerable and effective with respect to maintaining remissions.
