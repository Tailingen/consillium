This is an investigator-initiated trial designed to evaluate the safety, and efficacy of HN2301 in refractory myasthenia gravis
Refractory Myasthenia Gravis
DRUG: HN2301 injection
Adverse events related to HN2301, Incidence and severity of AEs associated with HN2301 as assessed by CTCAE v5., 3 months
vivo CAR T cell production, Assessment of CAR T production (CAR expression ratio in T cells) in the peripheral blood of MG patients by flow cytometry (FACS), Day-28 to14 days|B cell ratio and counts in peripheral blood, Assessment of B cell ratio and counts (B cell counts per μl peripheral blood) and B cell subsets(naive B cell, memory B cell) by flow cytometry (FACS) in peripheral blood, Day-28 to12 months|Change from baseline of MG-ADL score after HN2301 administration., 1. Assessment of MG-ADL score from baseline administration at various timepoints up to month 12 follow-up visit. A total score can fall between 0 and 24 with a higher score representing a more significant degree of disease activity.
2. Proportion of patients achieving a ≥2-point reduction in MG-ADL score following HN2301 administration., Day-28 to12 months|Change from baseline of MGC score after HN2301 administration., 1. Assessment of MGC score from baseline administration at various timepoints up to month 12 follow-up visit. A total score can fall between 0 and 50 with a higher score representing a more significant degree of disease activity.
2. Proportion of patients achieving a ≥3-point reduction in MGC score following HN2301 administration., Day-28 to12 months|Change from baseline of QMG score after HN2301 administration., 1. Assessment of QMG from baseline administration at various timepoints up to month 12 follow-up visit. A total score can fall between 0 and 32, with a higher score representing a more significant degree of disease activity.
2. Proportion of patients achieving a ≥3-point reduction in QMG score following HN2301 administration., Day-28 to12 months|Change from baseline of MG-QOL15r score after HN2301 administration., Assessment of MG-QOL15r from baseline administration at various timepoints up to month 12 follow-up visit. A total score can fall between 0 and 100, with a lower score representing a more significant degree of disease activity., Day-28 to12 months|Change of patients after HN2301 administration., 1. Proportion of patients without symptom worsening
2. Proportion of patients without symptom relapse
3. Proportion of patients achieving minimal clinical manifestations
4. Proportion of patients undergoing corticosteroid dose reduction, Day-28 to12 months|Time to achieve a ≥2 point reduction in MG-ADL score following HN2301 administration., The time (months) to achieve a ≥2 point reduction in MG-ADL score following HN2301 administration of the patient., 14 days-12 months
This study is a prospective exploratory clinical trial in subjects with refractory myasthenia gravis. The objective is to evaluate the safety, initial efficacy of HN2301injection in refractory myasthenia gravis.
