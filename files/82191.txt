Warning Signs of Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Prevention of SCC by at Risk Organ Transplant Recipients
Using focus group and cognitive interviews with organ transplant recipients, the investigators developed interactive workbooks: a) prevention by sun protection b) early detection by skin self-examination (SSE). The investigators hypothesis is if the patient learns by acquiring skills in a favorable environment, then the patient may reduce their anxiety, enhance self-efficacy and perform self-management by SSE and sun protection. The investigators also evaluate existing internet sources of primary and secondary prevention of skin cancer for organ transplant recipients.
