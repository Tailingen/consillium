Induction Chemotherapy Followed by Short Course Radiotherapy in Rectal Cancer
A Single-arm phase II trial evaluating induction chemotherapy with FOLFIRINOXm followed by short course radiotherapy (RT) in locally advanced rectal carcinoma
Rectal Cancer|Locally Advanced
DRUG: Chemotherapy With FOLFIRINOX ( 5 Fluorouracil, Oxaliplatine and Irinotecan)|RADIATION: Radiotherapy
Pathologic complete response, no tumor identified in the rectum or associated lymph nodes by final pathology following surgical resection, 1 month after surgery
Disease free survival, first relapse after surgery, 3 years|overall survival, death, 3 years|objective response rate to induction chemotherapy, immediately after completion of 6 cycles of chemotherapy ( each cycle is 14 days)
Total neoadjuvant treatment (TNT) is currently the standard of care in the management of locally advanced rectal cancer since recent studies have shown improved pathological complete response and disease-free survival with this approach. However, survival benefits remain unproven.

Two strategies of TNT are validated so far : induction chemotherapy with FOLFIRINOX followed by long course radio-chemotherapy (RCT) or short course RT (5x5 Gy) followed by consolidation chemotherapy with CAPOX (capecitabine and oxaliplatin) or FOLFOX (5 FU and oxaliplatin) .

The objective of investigators is to evaluate pathological complete response with a new strategy of TNT consisting in induction chemotherapy with FOLFIRINOXm followed by short course RT and a delayed surgery.
