The PFS was analyzed by using the Kaplan-Meier method., Time from first study intervention up to long term safety follow-up period (Up to 513 Days)|Part FE: Progression-free Survival (PFS) Time According to RECIST v 1.1 Assessed by Investigator, Progression-Free Survival was calculated as the time from the start of any study intervention to the date of first documentation of objective progression of disease or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. PD: At least a 20 percent (%) increase in the sum of the longest diameter (SLD) taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded from baseline or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions. The PFS was analyzed by using the Kaplan-Meier method., Time from first study intervention up to long term safety follow-up period (Up to 404 Days)|Part A: Overall Survival, Overall survival was defined as the time from treatment start to the date of death, regardless of the actual cause of the participant's death. The overall survival was analyzed by using the Kaplan-Meier method. Median, is estimated by Kaplan-Meier method which stands for the time that half of the participants are expected to be alive. Depending on the observed number of deaths, time of censoring for each participant, median survival time may not be reached or estimated (few deaths will lead the KM curve never crosses 50% survival line), hence median was not calculable for Part A: M3814 250 mg BID + Avelumab 800 mg Q2W arm. Participants that are still alive at the time of analysis will be censored and counted into the analysis., Time from first study intervention up to long term safety follow-up period (Up to 1359 Days)|Part B: Overall Survival, Overall survival was defined as the time from treatment start to the date of death, regardless of the actual cause of the participant's death. The overall survival was analyzed by using the Kaplan-Meier method. Median, is estimated by Kaplan-Meier method which stands for the time that half of the participants are expected to be alive. Depending on the observed number of deaths, time of censoring for each participant, median survival time may not be reached or estimated (few deaths will lead the KM curve never crosses 50% survival line), hence median was not calculable for Part B of the study. Participants that are still alive at the time of analysis will be censored and counted into the analysis., Time from first study intervention up to long term safety follow-up period (Up to 1359 Days)|Part FE: Overall Survival, Overall survival was defined as the time from treatment start to the date of death, regardless of the actual cause of the participant's death. The overall survival was analyzed by using the Kaplan-Meier method. Participants that are still alive at the time of analysis will be censored and counted into the analysis., Time from first study intervention up to long term safety follow-up period (Up to 1359 Days)|Part A: Best Percent Change From Baseline in Tumor Size According to RECIST v 1.1, Tumor size is derived as the best percent change from baseline in target lesions (sum of longest diameter for non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) at each time point., Time from first study intervention up to long term safety follow-up period (Up to 516 Days)|Part B: Best Percent Change From Baseline in Tumor Size According to RECIST v 1.1, Tumor size is derived as the best percent change from baseline in target lesions (sum of longest diameter for non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) at each time point., Time from first study intervention up to long term safety follow-up period (Up to 513 Days)|Part FE: Best Percent Change From Baseline in Tumor Size According to RECIST v 1.1, Tumor size is derived as the best percent change from baseline in target lesions (sum of longest diameter for non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) at each time point., Time from first study intervention up to long term safety follow-up period (Up to 404 Days)|Part B: Number of Participants With Radiotherapy (RT)-Induced Toxicity According to NCI-CTCAE v 5.0, Number of participants with radiotherapy-induced toxicities (mucositis and radiation dermatitis) were reported., Time from first study intervention up to long term safety follow-up period (Up to 512.4 Days)
The main purpose of the study was to evaluate a safe, tolerable recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) and/or the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of M3814 when given in combination with avelumab with and without radiotherapy in participants with selected advanced solid tumors.
