YES Study - Newly Diagnosed/Metastatic Intervention
This research study is being done to monitor common symptoms and behavior, and to provide supportive care information and peer support, as well as research opportunities for young women ages of 18-39 years old who have been diagnosed with stage 0-IV stage breast cancer using a web-based portal (YES), built for smartphones, tablets, and computers.
Breast Cancer|Symptom, Behavioral
BEHAVIORAL: YES portal
Vaginal dryness, One item regarding vaginal dryness on the BCPT will be used and grouped by moderate, quite a bit, extreme responses to define the vaginal dryness rate at 1 year. Based on historical data (from our ongoing Young Women's Breast Cancer Study), the 1-year vaginal dryness rate for the control group is assumed to be 27%. For the Phase II randomized controlled trial component of the study,it will have 85% power to detect a 10% difference in the primary endpoint with 367 patients, and would plan to recruit 408 to account for dropout (last row of the table)., 1 year
Socio-demographics, Women will be asked about their race, education, employment and financial status using items selected from the Alliance Patient Questionnaire that is currently being piloted (Alliance A191401), adapted to include an item on employment status that has been tested previously in a breast cancer population and is going to be added to the next version of the Alliance Patient Questionnaire., Up to 5 years|Financial burden, Items adapted from the National Health Interview Survey29 and the Cancer Outcomes Research and Surveillance (CanCORS) Caregiver Study30 will be used to assess financial burden and to estimate out of pocket expenses attributed to their breast cancer diagnosis., Up to 5 years|Smoking and alcohol use, Smoking and alcohol use will be evaluated using items selected from the prior cohort study of young women with breast cancer and our prior Smoke Free Study, Up to 5 years|Physical Activity, Physical activity will be assessed using a modified version of the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ).This self-reported measure is used to estimate weekly frequencies of strenuous, moderate, and light activities. It has been modified to include average duration of activities. Weekly minutes of moderate and vigorous activity (MVPA) will be the main measure of physical activity; however weekly minutes of vigorous activity (MVA) and the average weekly frequency of mild, moderate and strenuous intensity exercise based on the Leisure Score Index (LSI) will also be examined to evaluate change in physical activity behaviors. The Godin measure will be administered at multiple timepoints and will be used to evaluate change in physical activity over time., Up to 5 years|Mobility, The EQ-5D-5L33, 34 is a summary measure of health status for use in evaluating health and healthcare and includes five functional dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) plus a visual analog scale (EQ-VAS) that asks participants to assess how good or bad their health is today on a 0 (worst health imaginable) -100 (best health imaginable) scale. The EQ-5D-5L will be used to generate and evaluate QALYs., Up to 5 years|Self-Care, The EQ-5D-5L33, 34 is a summary measure of health status for use in evaluating health and healthcare and includes five functional dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) plus a visual analog scale (EQ-VAS) that asks participants to assess how good or bad their health is today on a 0 (worst health imaginable) -100 (best health imaginable) scale. The EQ-5D-5L will be used to generate and evaluate QALYs. T, Up to 5 years|Usual Activities, The EQ-5D-5L33, 34 is a summary measure of health status for use in evaluating health and healthcare and includes five functional dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) plus a visual analog scale (EQ-VAS) that asks participants to assess how good or bad their health is today on a 0 (worst health imaginable) -100 (best health imaginable) scale. The EQ-5D-5L will be used to generate and evaluate QALYs., Up to 5 years|Pain and Discomfort, The EQ-5D-5L33, 34 is a summary measure of health status for use in evaluating health and healthcare and includes five functional dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) plus a visual analog scale (EQ-VAS) that asks participants to assess how good or bad their health is today on a 0 (worst health imaginable) -100 (best health imaginable) scale., Up to 5 years|Anxiety and Depression, The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)35, 36 will be used to evaluate for clinically significant depression.

(see management strategy below for the suicidality question in particular). Distress and anxiety will be assessed using select items from the PRO-CTCAE as described below. We will also ask patients to indicate the face that best represents how they feel using a publicly available 5 emoji Likert scale, Up to 5 years|Overall Symptoms, The Patient-Reported Outcomes Version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) is a patient-centered, standardized self-report measure that enables patients to report symptoms and AEs. The PRO-CTCAE has demonstrated favorable validity, reliability, and responsiveness in a large heterogeneous United States sample of cancer patients undergoing treatment.37 40 PRO-CTCAE items that are salient to young women with breast cancer will be collected. The PRO-CTCAE items use conditional branching for AEs that contain multiple attributes. A modified 19-item version of the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial (BCPT) Symptom Checklist will evaluate common symptoms, including hot flashes, fatigue, sexual problems, and musculoskeletal complaints. The PROMIS 8-item Fatigue Scale will be used to assess fatigue. Sleep quality will be evaluated with the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) as well as with a modified Self-Assessment of Sleep Survey (SASS)., Up to 5 years|Adherence to Hormonal or other Oral Therapy, Measurement of adherence to oral therapy using a 10 item self-report medication adherence measure based on work from Voils et al. among women who report currently prescribed oral hormonal or other oral therapy, Up to 5 years|Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA) Concerns, AYA concerns will be measured by 14 items from the AYA HOPE Study42 follow-up questionnaire that ask patients to rate their level of concern regarding a range of AYA survivorship-focused issues, including fertility, diet and nutrition, physical activity, weight management, survivorship care, recurrence concerns, and financial concerns, and we have added genetics and body image. 3 items have been added to the AYA Concerns that ask about the desire for additional information about select issues facing young women with breast cancer including about body image/beauty, smoking, and alcohol consumption., Up to 5 years|Emotional Symptoms, Anxiety and depression will be measured by the 14-item Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). This is a reliable and valid instrument that is well received by patients., Up to 5 years
This is a prospective, interventional cohort study with an embedded Phase II randomized controlled clinical trial with a parallel design.

* The research study procedures include screening for eligibility, consent, enrolled, randomization into 1 of 4 groups.
* The study interventions including the (web-based portal ) YES portal use including regular assessments, serial outcome surveys, medical record review, and tumor/blood collection.
* The YES portal is a web-based portal designed for access by smartphone, tablet, or laptop/desktop. The portal is designed to help monitor cancer related issues and to share self-management information and resources to those interested in particular issues or who score high enough on the symptom measures designed to assess and track noticeable symptoms (and thus might benefit from such), as well as to share potential research opportunities when available. The portal is also designed to create a community among participants through the yeschat.org discussion board
* Participants will be in this research study for up to 5 years with the option to opt out of portal assessment component follow-up after only 1 year.
* It is expected that about 400 people will take part in this research study
