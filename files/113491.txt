Radiotherapy Combined With GDP With or Without Chidamide in Stage I/II Extranodal Nasal NK/T-cell Lymphoma
Currently, combined chemotherapy (CT) and radiation (RT) is recognized as the standard treatment for high-risk early-stage NKTCL. However, treatment failure occured in nearly 30% of patients receiving CRT and systemic failure are the most common failure form. Chidamide is a HADC inhibitor, which presents satisfactory efficacy in NKTCL especially in terms of improving durable remission time. In our previous study, IMRT followed by GDP was demonstrated effective in early-stage NKTCL. Therefore, we designed a prospective phase II clinical trial of IMRT followed by GDP with or without chidamide in patients with high-risk early-stage NKTCL.
