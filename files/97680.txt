Change From the Time-matched Baseline in the Fridericia Correction of QTc (QTcF), Baseline, Days 1 and 10 multiple timepoints postdose (up to 24 hours) in Cycle 1|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) A serious is any experience that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect or precaution that: results in death, is life-threatening, required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is medically significant., From the first dose through 30 days after administration of the last dose of study drug (up to 328 days)
The drug tested in this study is called alisertib. Alisertib is being tested to assess the effect of a proton pump inhibitor and strong metabolic inducer on the PK of a single 50 mg dose of alisertib administered as enteric-coated tablets (ECTs).

The study enrolled 55 patients. Participants received either:

* Esomeprazole 40 mg and Alisertib 50 mg
* Rifampin 600 mg and Alisertib 50 mg

All participants were asked to take one tablet of alisertib either once or twice daily in all cycles. In Cycle 2, participants were asked to take alisertib plus either esomeprazole or rifampin.

This trial was conducted the United States. The overall time to participate in this study was 10 months. Participants made multiple visits to the clinic plus a final visit, 30 days after receiving their last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
