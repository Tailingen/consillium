Immuno 1: Immune Reconstitution Following Conventional or High-Dose Chemotherapy With Stem Cell Transplant
The purpose of this study is to conduct an analysis of the influences of

1. conventional chemotherapy
2. high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplant
3. high-dose chemotherapy followed by allogeneic stem cell transplant on the recovery of the immune system.

Detailed analysis will help to better understand the pathways of recovery of the immune system following chemotherapy as well as the pathways of recovery of the immune system following autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
Leukemia|Medulloblastoma
Detailed analysis will be performed at preselected time points following therapy by

* standard flow cytometry in combination with intracellular cytokine/antigen staining
* spectratype analysis
* TREC assays
