LCI-HEM-MYE-CRD-004 (MMRC-073 CARJAK): Study of CRD for Carfilzomib-Refractory Multiple Myeloma
The primary objective of Phase I is to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ruxolitinib in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone. The primary objective of phase II is to evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) at 4 months in multiple myeloma subjects who receive the combination treatment carfilzomib, dexamethasone, and ruxolitinib.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Carfilzomib|DRUG: Ruxolitinib|DRUG: Dexamethasone
Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), DLTs will be determined for each subject as a binary variable indicating whether or not the subject experienced a DLT during Cycle 1, 28 days
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective response will be determined for each subject as a binary variable indicating whether or not the subject achieved a best overall response of PR or better as per the IMWG criteria, Approximately 180 days after treatment start (disease assessment occurred after every 28-day cycle)|Clinical Benefit Rate, Clinical benefit will be determined for each subject as a binary variable indicating whether or not the subject achieved a best overall response of minimal response (MR) or better as determined by the IMWG criteria, Approximately 180 days after treatment start (disease assessment occurred after every 28-day cycle)|Disease Control Rate, Disease control will be determined for each subject as a binary variable indicating whether or not the subject achieved a disease response or stable disease for greater than or equal to 8 weeks, Approximately 180 days after treatment start (disease assessment occurred after every 28-day cycle)|Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the duration of time from the initiation of study treatment with ruxolitinib to first occurrence of either progressive disease or death without progressive disease., approx. 5 years|Time to Best Response, Time to best response will be defined as the time from initiation of ruxolitinib treatment to the time of best objective status assessment of response., Approximately 180 days after treatment start (disease assessment occurred after every 28-day cycle)|Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the duration from initiation of ruxolitinib treatment to the date of death from any cause., approx. 5 years|Time to Progression, Time to progression (TTP) is defined as the duration of time from the initiation of study treatment with ruxolitinib to first occurrence of either progressive disease or death., approx. 5 years|Duration of Response, Duration of response will be defined as the time from first objective status assessment of response to the time of first documented disease progression or death., approx. 5 years
This is an open-label, Phase I/II study of carfilzomib, ruxolitinib, and low-dose dexamethasone for carfilzomib-refractory multiple myeloma. Phase I is designed to evaluate overall maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ruxolitinib in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone in the following cohorts: Cohort 1) 5mg ruxolitinib, Cohort 2) 10mg ruxolitinib, Cohort 3) 15mg ruxolitinib. Phase II is designed to evaluate 4-month progression-free survival (PFS) in the following cohorts: Cohort A) non-responders to Phase I regimen, Cohort B) responders to Phase I regimen. Up to 18 evaluable subjects will be enrolled in Phase I over approximately 12 months. An additional 30 evaluable subjects will be enrolled in Phase II over 24 months.
