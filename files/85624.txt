A Randomised Trial Investigating the Additional Benefit of Hydroxychloroquine(HCQ)to Short Course Radiotherapy (SCRT) in Patients Aged 70 Years and Older With High Grade Gliomas (HGG)
There is emerging evidence that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), a drug used commonly in the prevention/ treatment of malaria, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematosus, may improve survival outcome in a variety of cancers including HGG, with few side effects.

In this trial the investigators wish to investigate whether treatment with radiotherapy and hydroxychloroquine is more effective than treatment with radiotherapy alone.
