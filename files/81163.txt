Erlotinib With Concurrent Brain Radiotherapy and Secondary Brain Radiotherapy After Recurrence With Erlotinib in NSCLC Non-increased-intracranial-pressure Symptomatic Brain Metastases
This project is aim to explore non-increased-intracranial-pressure symptomatic brain metastases of NSCLC, and if the OS of secondary brain radiotherapy after recurrence with Erlotinib is better than Erlotinib with concurrent brain radiotherapy. Treatment group are treated with Erlotinib until brain tumor progression, then gave brain radiotherapy, and continued to take Erlotinib till extracranial lesions progression. Control group are Erlotinib with concurrent brain radiotherapy, and continued to take Erlotinib after radiotherapy until recurrence or termination for other reasons.
