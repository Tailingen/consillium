Economic Evaluation of the Use of Plerixafor for Autologous HSC Transplantation for Multiple Myeloma
This study aims to realize an economic evaluation of the introduction of Plerixafor in addition to G-CSF and alternative options, in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) who failed or insufficiently mobilize peripheral blood stem and progenitor cells in response to G-CSF alone.

OTHER: Economic evaluation
Cost-effectiveness analysis, The cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed using the collection of a transplantable graft as effectiveness criteria; the suitability of collected cell products for transplantation will be judged as per institutional criteria.

Direct medical costs will be estimated by micro-costing, i.e. by measuring physical quantities (capital and labor) consumed for each patient and attributing corresponding monetary costs on the basis of average French prices. Costs (including room - inpatient and outpatient, drugs and laboratory tests) will be estimated on the basis of patients' medical records., 1 year
