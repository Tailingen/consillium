A Dose Finding Study Followed by a Safety and Efficacy Study for Patients With Multiple Myeloma or Lymphoma
The Phase 1 portion of this study will determine the safety of TAS4464 and the most appropriate dose for patients with Multiple Myeloma or Lymphoma.
Multiple Myeloma|NonHodgkin Lymphoma
DRUG: TAS4464
Number of patients experiencing any dose-limiting toxicities, during dose escalation period, to determine maximum tolerated dose of TAS4464, using NCI CTCAE criteria, laboratory testing, performance status assessments, and other routine visit procedures, Completion of Cycle 1 (28 days)|Efficacy of TAS4464, defined as Objective Response Rate (ORR) per IWG criteria (NHL) and IMWG criteria (MM). This will take into consideration routine assessments including: imaging scans, physical exams, blood tests, urine tests and biopsy results, Up to 5 years
The trial was put on Clinical Hold prior to Phase 2 due to cases of drug induced liver injury meeting the criteria for Hy's Law.

Background and Rationale:

â€¢ TAS4464 is an investigational NEDD8 activating enzyme (NAE) inhibitor, a compound which may affect cancer cell growth and survival. Thus, TAS4464 may help in the treatment of cancer.

Phase 1:

Primary:

* To investigate the safety and tolerability of TAS4464
* To identify a tolerated dose of TAS4464

Secondary:

* To investigate the preliminary efficacy of TAS4464
* To investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and the pharmacogenomics (PGx) of TAS4464
* To investigate the pharmacodynamics of TAS4464
