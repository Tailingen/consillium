Use of Myo-inositol as Adjuvant Therapy in Patients With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) in Vitro Fertilization (IVF)
The original mechanism of action of myo-inositol and preliminary results available in the literature on its use in IVF suggest its value as adjuvant gonadotropin therapy to reduce the risk of OHSS in PCOS patients.

The aim of the study is to demonstrate that administration of myo-inositol decreases the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) in high-risk infertile with PCOS supported in IVF patients.
