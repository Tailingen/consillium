A Window of Opportunity Study to Assess the Modulation of Biomarkers in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Cancer (HNSCC) By Preoperative Treatment With BYL719
Single centre, single arm, preoperative window of opportunity study with a biomarker endpoint (expression profiling by RNA sequencing). Patients with resectable, histologically confirmed head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) for whom surgical treatment is planned as definitive management will be eligible.
Head and Neck Squamous Cell Cancer
DRUG: BYL719
Phospho-S6 (235/6) Expression, Phospho-S6 (235/6) measured at baseline from the biopsy tissue sample will be compared to the value measured following BYL719 treatment taken from the tissue removed at surgery using a paired t-test., Measured at baseline and at surgery
Phospho-AKT Levels (Ser473), For Phospho-AKT levels (Ser473) values measured at baseline from the biopsy tissue sample will be compared to the value measured following BYL719 treatment taken from the tissue removed at surgery using a paired t-test., Measured at baseline and at surgery|Ki-67 Levels, Ki-67 levels values measured at baseline from the biopsy tissue sample will be compared to the value measured following BYL719 treatment taken from the tissue removed at surgery using a paired t-test., Measured at baseline and at surgery|Severity of Adverse Events, The frequency and severity of adverse events will be tabulated using counts and proportions detailing frequently occurring, serious, and severe events of interest., At baseline and within 14 days of last dose
This is a single centre, single arm, preoperative window of opportunity study with a biomarker endpoint (expression profiling by RNA sequencing). Patients with resectable, histologically confirmed head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) for whom surgical treatment is planned as definitive management will be eligible. The median time from consultation to major head and neck surgery at our institution is 3.2 +/- 2.0 weeks (1 standard deviation). To provide the maximal opportunity to achieve a biomarker response and potentially observe clinical responses, patients will receive BYL719 orally daily at the maximum tolerated dose (400 mg/day) for 14 days. All patients will receive surgery as the standard of care. The gene expression profile, including Ki-67, from the surgical specimen and mandatory baseline tumor biopsy will be evaluated for primary and secondary pharmacodynamic endpoints.
