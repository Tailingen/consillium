Pre-operative Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiotherapy Followed by Immediate Surgery for Pancreatic Cancer
A window of opportunity feasibility study assessing pre-operative stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy followed by immediate surgery in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
Cancer of Pancreas
RADIATION: Pre-operative stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy
The feasibility of delivering pre-operative SABR followed by immediate surgery as determined by rate of post-operative complications at 30 days., Rate of post-operative complications measured as the number of adverse events reported up to 30 days post surgery, Up to 30days post surgery
Measure of surgical resection margin status following pre-operative SABR and immediate surgery, Measure of Resection margin status (R0 complete resection, R1 microscopic residual tumour, R2 macroscopic residual tumour) from the post surgery histopathology report, Post surgery|Measure of local control post SABR and surgery, Number of patients with local control from CT scans up to 12months from the start of SABR, 1 year|Measure of disease-free survival post SABR and surgery, Number of patients with disease progression from CT scans up to 12months from the start of SABR, 1 year|Measure of overall survival post SABR and surgery, Number of deaths up to 12 months from the start of SABR treatment, 1 year|Acute and late toxicity of pre-operative SABR: Number of adverse events, Number of adverse events reported up to 12 months from the start of SABR treatment, 1 year
This is a single-centre, prospective, non-randomised feasibility study. This study will assess whether SABR can safely be given immediately prior to Whipple's resection by assessing the rate of post-operative complications.
