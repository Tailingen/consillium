Multiple Firings in Double-stapled Colorectal Anastomosis
Multiple linear stapler firings during double stapling technique (DST) is associated with anastomotic leakage (AL) after laparoscopic low anterior resection (LAR). We aim to investigate the risk factors and then to develop a deep learning model to predict the usage of ≥3 linear stapler cartridges during DST anastomosis.
