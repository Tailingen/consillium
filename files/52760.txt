Evaluation of Endorings-2-assisted Colonoscopy: a New Accessory for Improvement of Adenoma Detection Rate?
Screening colonoscopy for colorectal cancer is essential to diagnose and remove adenomas, precancerous stages of colorectal cancer. Unfortunately approximately 25 % of all adenomas are missed during the examination. Recently a new colonoscopy accessory, the Endorings-2 (EndoAid Ltd., Casearea, Israel), has been designed to improved the detection of adenomas during colonoscopy (adenoma detection rate).

Endorings-2 is a silicone-rubber device that is fitted on the colonoscope and is equipped with circular flexible silicon rings mechanically stretching the colonic folds during withdrawal.

This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of Endorings-2 to improve the adenoma detection rate in a prospective, blinded clinical trial. 292 patients with an indication for a screening colonoscopy shall be included (1:1 randomization in standard colonoscopy versus Endorings-2-assisted colonoscopy).
