Immunotherapy With Nivolumab or Nivolumab Plus Ipilimumab vs. Double Placebo for Stage IV Melanoma w. NED
This is a prospective, double-blind placebo-controlled, multicenter, randomized phase II trial testing the adjuvant immunotherapy with Nivolumab plus Ipilimumab Placebo or Nivolumab plus Ipilimumab versus Double Placebo Control as a post-surgical/post-radiation treatment for stage IV melanoma with no evidence of disease (NED).
Malignant Melanoma
DRUG: Nivolumab + Placebo|DRUG: Nivolumab + Ipilimumab|DRUG: Double Placebo Control
Efficacy of adjuvant immunotherapy with Nivolumab alone or in combination with Ipilimumab (Recurrence-free survival), Recurrence-free survival (RFS) defined as the time from date of randomization until the date of the first recurrence (local or distant metastasis), new primary melanoma or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., 24 months after the last patient ended treatment
Overall survival (OS), The OS of a patient is defined as the time from date of randomization until date of death., 24 months after the last patient ended treatment|Time to recurrence (TTR), The TTR of a patient is defined as the time from date of randomization until date of disease recurrence (local or distant metastasis) or melanoma-related death., 24 months after the last patient ended treatment|Progression/recurrence free survival 2 (PRFS2) for crossover patients of Arm C, The PRFS2 is defined as time from date of randomization until the date of first disease progression per RECIST 1.1 beyond the initial unresectable disease recurrence, the date of second recurrence in patients without evidence of disease after surgery of a resectable first recurrence or the date of death, whichever occurs first., 24 months after the last patient ended treatment
Safety / Toxicity All adverse events ≥ Grade 3 according to CTCAE Version 4.0 criteria, All adverse events ≥ Grade 3 according to CTCAE Version 4.0 criteria, that are related to the administration of the investigational agents will be assessed, until 90 days after discontinuation of dosing
This study will allow for direct comparison of the clinical benefit provided by Nivolumab monotherapy or Nivolumab combined with Ipilimumab versus double placebo control. Furthermore, it will also allow for direct comparison of the respective safety profiles of Nivolumab monotherapy or Nivolumab combined with Ipilimumab. Nivolumab monotherapy was chosen as one of the experimental arms because of a favourable risk-benefit ratio assessed in the large Phase 1 study (MDX1106-03/CA209-003). The combination of Nivolumab and Ipilimumab was chosen as an experimental arm because of the preliminary evidence from the Phase 1 study CA209-004 suggesting synergy between Nivolumab and Ipilimumab resulting in a higher frequency of patients with increased tumour burden reduction. Evaluating both Nivolumab monotherapy and the combination of Nivolumab and Ipilimumab will provide clinical data allowing clinicians to select the appropriate treatment for each patient based on their individual risk-benefit ratio.
