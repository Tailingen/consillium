Efficacy and Safety of Adjunctive Use of Rifaximin In Preventing Radiotherapy-induced Diarrhea in Cancer Patients
Preclinical data indicate that rifaximin could be repurposed as a novel strategy for preventing and reducing the severity of gastrointestinal damage, particularly diarrhea, that results from pelvic irradiation. So, The aim of the work is to investigate the impact of Rifaximin on the incidence and severity of radiotherapy-induced diarrhea in cancer patients undergoing pelvic irradiation with or without chemotherapy.
