Cardiovascular Risk Markers in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)
Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are more often overweight or obese and are more insulin resistant than women without the condition and may be at greater risk of developing cardiovascular disease. It is not know whether it is the overweight and insulin resistant component of PCOS, or PCOS per se which leads to the greater cardiovascular disease risk. The aim of this study was to examine cardiovascular risk markers in women with PCOS versus a control population matched for body mass index (BMI), and or, insulin resistance
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
Assessment of Insulin resistance in women with PCOS compared with BMI and age matched controls, Subjects underwent a standard 75g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and blood were taken fasting and at 2 hours. Surrogate markers of insulin resistance (HOMA) and insulin sensitivity (Avignon index of Insulin Sensitivity; QUICKI) were calculated, Recruitment ran from Nov 2006-July 2008; Each subject attended the study location fasting on one occasion
Assessment of concentrations of androgens in women with PCOS compared with controls, Bloods were taken in the fasted state and circulating concentrations of androgens (DHEAS, testosterone, androstenedione) were assessed, Recruitment ran from Nov 2006-July 2008; Each subject attended the study location fasting on one occasion|Assessment of lipid profile in women with PCOS compared with age matched controls, Bloods were taken in the fasted state and circulating concentrations of lipids assessed, Recruitment ran from Nov 2006-July 2008; Each subject attended the study location fasting on one occasion|Assessment of inflammatory profile in women with PCOS compared with controls, Bloods were taken in the fasted state and circulating concetrations of several important markers of inflammation as well as key adipokines were assessed, Recruitment ran from Nov 2006-July 2008; Each subject attended the study location fasting on one occasion
