Radiometabolic Therapy (RMT) With 177Lu PSMA 617 in Advanced Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC)
Radiometabolic Therapy (RMT) with 177Lu PSMA 617 in advanced castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC): efficacy and toxicity evaluation
Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer|68Ga-PSMA PET/CT Positive
DRUG: 177Lu-PSMA
Disease Control Rate (DCR ), DCR is defined as the percentage of patients who have achieved complete response, partial response and stable disease lasting for at least 6 months from therapy start. DCR will be evaluated using the new international criteria proposed by the Version 1.1 Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)., up to 36 months|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, The evaluation of the Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events starts from the 1st treatment until 30 days after the last treatment cycle; Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events are evaluated according to version 4.03 CTC-AE criteria., up to 30 days after the last treatment cycle
Progression free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the start treatment date to the date of first observation of documented disease progression or death due to any cause. Patients without tumor progression at the time of analysis will be censored at their last date of tumor evaluation., up to 36 months|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the time from the therapy start to the date of death due to any cause or the date of last contact (censored observation) at the date of data cut-off., up to 36 months
Radiometabolic Therapy (RMT) with 177Lu PSMA 617 in advanced castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC): efficacy and toxicity evaluation. Single-center, prospective, non controlled, open label, phase II trial. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the Disease Control Rate (DCR) and the safety as co-primary objective.

The secondary objectives are: late toxicity, PFS, OS, biochemical response and dosimetry.
