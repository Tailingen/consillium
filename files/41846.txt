Previous studies have established the existence of the mesogastrium, dividing it into six sections. The mesogastrium is identified during surgery and utilized in surgical practice. The aim of the present study was to further investigate its role in gastric cancer prognosis.Between January 2014 and January 2018, patients from the Tongji Hospital were included in this post-hoc analysis, including data from a randomized clinical study (DCGC01; http://www.clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01978444). Mesogastria containing metastatic lymph nodes (LNs) were referred to as metastatic mesogastria. Pathology reports were examined to assess metastases in the mesogastrium. Survival was assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariable Cox models.
