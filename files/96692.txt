A Kaplan-Meier curve will be provided., From first dose until response or progression, up to approximately 1 year.|Median overall survival (mOS), Time from first dose until death from any cause. A Kaplan-Meier curve will be provided., From time of first dose until 2 years after end of treatment (Up to approximately 3 years).
Pharmacokinetics (PK): Maximum plasma concentration of drug (Cmax), Highest concentration of drug measured in the PK samples, Samples will be collected a predose through 24 hours post dose on Days 1 and 8, then pre-dose on Cycle 2 Day 1 and Cycle 3 Day 1|PK: Time to reach Cmax (Tmax), Time from dosing until collection of the PK samples with the highest drug concentration., Samples will be collected a predose through 24 hours post dose on Days 1 and 8, then pre-dose on Cycle 2 Day 1 and Cycle 3 Day 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|PK: Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from time 0 to time of last quantifiable sample (AUC0-t), The area under the concentration-time curve from dosing (time 0) to time t., Samples will be collected a predose through 24 hours post dose on Days 1 and 8, then pre-dose on Cycle 2 Day 1 and Cycle 3 Day 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Measurement of tyrosine kinase activity (TKa) levels in serum, Tyrosine kinase 1 (TK1) is a metabolic enzyme fundamentally involved in DNA synthesis that plays a critical role in cell proliferation, Samples will be collected at Screening, Days, 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, then monthly until end of treatment, up to approximately 1 year
This is a phase 1/2a, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of escalating doses of narazaciclib (ON 123300) in combination with letrozole for patients with recurrent metastatic low-grade endometrioid endometrial cancer and other Gynecologic Malignancies. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics will also be assessed.

In Phase 1, eligible patients will be enrolled to escalating dose cohorts. Cohorts will receive escalating doses of oral narazaciclib starting at 160 mg orally, once daily, in combination with letrozole 2.5 mg orally, once daily, in 28-day cycles in a typical 3 + 3 design. The dose of narazaciclib will be increased in 40 mg/day increments from cohort to cohort until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the minimal biologically effective dose (MBED) of narazaciclib orally, once daily, in combination with letrozole 2.5 mg orally, once daily, is reached and the RP2D of the combination is established. Three to 6 patients will be enrolled per dose cohort in phase 1.

In Phase 2a, narazaciclib and letrozole at the RP2D established in Phase 1 will be administered to approximately 30 eligible patients with documented recurrent metastatic LGEEC for 28-day cycles. Treatment will continue until disease progression, patient withdrawal, or unacceptable drug-related toxicity.
