Comparison Between Double Tract Anastomosis and Esophagogastrostomy After Radical Proximal Gastrectomy
The patients with upper gastric cancer (cT1N0M0) or gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (diameter less than 4 cm) will be enrolled into this study. Each of these patients will undergo radical proximal gastrectomy and be randomly allocated into one of the two groups, double tract anastomosis group or esophagogastrostomy group. The following data will be collected to compare the difference between the two reconstruction methods: the rate of reflux esophagitis, postoperative quality of life, economic expenditure, the safety of operation, postoperative recovery, postoperative nutrition status and oncological effect. Through the comprehensive analysis, the result of this study will elucidate the best of the reconstruction method after proximal gastrectomy.
Gastric Cancer|GastroEsophageal Cancer
PROCEDURE: Double tract anatomosis|PROCEDURE: Esophagogastrostomy
Rate of reflux esophagitis after operation, The rate of reflux esophagitis after operation will be assessed by gastrointestinal endoscopy with Los Angeles (LA) classification. the degree of reflux esophagitis will be classified as N, A, B, C or D level, and latter levels represent a more severe reflux esophagitis., 12 months
postoperative quality of life, Assessed by European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life questionnaire (QLQ) - C30 questionnaire, the total score ranges from 30 to 126, and higher values represent a worse outcome., 12months|postoperative quality of life, Assessed by European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life questionnaire (QLQ) - STO22 questionnaire, the total score ranges from 22 to 88, and higher values represent a worse outcome., 12months
