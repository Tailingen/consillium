Exercise in Older Women With Breast Cancer During Systemic Therapy
BREACE is a prospective randomized controlled trial. The aim is to investigate the effect of an exercise-based intervention among older participants with breast cancer treated with adjuvant or first-line systemic therapy.

The hypotheses: That the intervention will maintain or increase physical function levels, reduce symptoms and side effects, improve quality of life and psychological wellbeing, and prevent weight loss and muscle wasting
