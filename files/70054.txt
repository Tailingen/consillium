IMRT Lower Limb Soft Tissue Sarcoma
Intensity-modulated radiation therapy may make wound healing problems less likely by 1)precisely shaping the region of high radiation dose to the shape of the tissue which harbours tumour cells, and 2) precisely shaping the regions of low radiation dose to the shapes of the normal tissues which are more sensitive to radiation effects.

RADIATION: Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy
Major wound complications within 120 days following surgery, 120 days post-op
Assess acute and late radiation toxicity including limb edema, up to120 days
