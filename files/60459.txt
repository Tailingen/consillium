This research utilizes two distinct research designs to evaluate two separate behavioral interventions.

The first is a between-subject randomized controlled trial to evaluate a patient-focused intervention. The intervention consists of a booklet designed to encourage patients to view themselves as part of the patient-physician team and to participate actively in clinical interactions by asking questions and stating concerns.

The second is a within-subject interrupted time series design to evaluate a physician-focused intervention. The intervention is an educational module and email reminders designed to encourage physicians to discuss trials with all eligible patients using patient-centered communication.In the patient-focused intervention, patients are randomized to an intervention or usual care group, and comparison of outcomes is made between groups.
