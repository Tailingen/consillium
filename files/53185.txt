Treatment Protocols for Patients With Symptomatic Oral Lichen Planus
The primary objective of this study was to compare the therapeutic efficacy of clobetasol propionate 0.05% oral gel versus an anti-inflammatory mouthwash in an oral solution for the management of patients suffering from symptomatic OLP. The secondary objective was to analyze which one of the two treatments induced a greater risk of developing side effects.

DRUG: Healing evaluation
Clinical Mucosal healing, Patients clinically were evaluated using the scale used by Thongprasom et al. as reference. This gives a score that varies from 0 to 5, using a millimetre reference: 0, in the absence of lesions; 1, in the presence of hyperkeratosis streaks; 2, in the presence of an atrophic area less than 1 mm2; 3, in the presence of an atrophic area greater than 1 mm2; 4, in the presence of an erosive area less than 1 mm2; 5, in the presence of an erosive area greater than 1 mm2. In the presence of multiple injuries, the value has been calculated by summing the values of each injury., 180 days
Forty patients were assigned (20 patients per group), through a randomized design, to receive clobetasol (clobetasol gel 0.05%), or an anti-inflammatory mouthwash (mouthwash which contains calcium hydroxide, hyaluronic acid, Umbelliferone and Oligomeric Proanthocyanidins) for 3-months. At baseline (T0) and after 3 months (T1), patients were subjected to clinical and oral assessments and were evaluated for the symptoms (Numerical Pain Scale, NRS score) and signs (Thongprasom's score) of OLP. Data were calculated using T-test for the dependent variable, Wilcoxon test and Mann-Witney u test.
