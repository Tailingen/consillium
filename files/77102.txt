Study of ORIC-114 in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors Harboring an EGFR or HER2 Alteration
The purpose of this study is to establish the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and/or maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and antitumor activity of ORIC-114 as a Single Agent or in Combination with Chemotherapy when administered to patients with advanced solid tumors harboring an EGFR or HER2 alteration.

ORIC-114 is a brain penetrant, selective, orally bioavailable, irreversible small molecule inhibitor designed to target EGFR and HER2 alterations, making it a promising therapeutic candidate for development in patients whose tumors harbor these alterations, including those with CNS metastases.

This is a first-in-human, open-label, single arm, multicenter, dose escalation study of ORIC-114 as a single agent (Part I), followed by dose optimization (Part II) to establish the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and antitumor activity of ORIC-114 in patients with advanced solid tumors harboring an EGFR or HER2 alteration who have exhausted available treatment options. After the optimal RP2D has been determined, Phase 2 will be initiated via protocol amendment to add one or more expansion cohorts of patients with specific tumor types, treatment history, and/or expression of a specific biomarker to evaluate the antitumor activity of ORIC-114.

After completion of Part I dose escalation, Part III, a dose escalation study of ORIC-114 in combination with chemotherapy (carboplatin-pemetrexed) may be initiated to establish the RP2D and/or MTD and antitumor activity for the combination (US sites only).
