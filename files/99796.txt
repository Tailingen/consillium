Radiofrequency Ablation in Treating Patients With Liver Cancer (Hepatocellular Carcinoma)
This phase II trial studies how effectively radiofrequency ablation prevents recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with easily removable tumors. Radiofrequency ablation uses a high-frequency, electric current to kill tumor cells.
Carcinoma, Hepatocellular
PROCEDURE: radiofrequency ablation|PROCEDURE: laparoscopy
Local recurrence, defined as the recurrence at the size of original tumor, Local recurrence will be summarized using descriptive statistics., Up to 2 years
Morbidity and mortality associated with RFA under ideal conditions, The incidences of surgical complications and procedure-related death will be calculated., 30 days|Overall survival rate, Kaplan-Meier product limit method will be used to estimate the 2-year overall survival. The median overall survival will also be, At 2 years|Disease-free survival rate, Kaplan-Meier product limit method will be used to estimate the 2-year disease-free survival. The median disease-free survival will also be estimated., At 2 years|Ability of patients who develop recurrence to undergo salvage transplantation, At the time of recurrence, the patient is evaluated to see if she/he falls within the Milan criteria; if she/he does, then she/he is considered able to undergo salvage transplantation., Up to 2 years
