Multicentre Medical-economic Study Evaluating the Efficacy of Adding ZOlédronique Acid to STERéotaxique Radiotherapy in the Treatment of Vertebral Metastases
Hypo-fractured radiotherapy in stereotactic conditions (RSHF) of bone metastases allows high doses to be delivered to the affected bone segment while sparing adjacent healthy tissues as well as possible. In addition, it not only reduces pain and prevents spinal cord compression, but also improves long-term control of metastatic disease.

Zoledronic acid reduces bone complications. The economic literature shows that stereotactic radiotherapy, like zoledronic acid, are cost-effective strategies in these indications. The objective of this research project is to evaluate the efficiency of adding zoledronic acid to stereotactic radiotherapy in the treatment of vertebral metastases.
Vertebral Metastasis
COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Zoledronic Acid 4Mg Solution for Injection + Hypo-fractured radiotherapy in stereotactic conditions|RADIATION: Hypo-fractured radiotherapy in stereotactic conditions
Differential Cost Result Ratio (DCRR) expressed as cost per year of life earned in good health, The determination of the DCRR includes Identification of care consumption ; The measurement of costs ; overall survival at 2 years ; Calculation of utilities using the EQ5D-5L questionnaire, 24 months
Survival without vertebral compression fractures, At 12 months and 24 months|Pain control, Pain control will be assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS) that measures pain intensity, prevents it, initiates or monitors drug or non-drug treatment, and the Brief Pain inventory, a questionnaire that quickly assesses the severity of pain and its impact on the patient's daily life., at inclusion, 12 and 24 months|Survival without bone complication, At 12 months and 24 months
