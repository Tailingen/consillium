Use of Tamoxifen in Systemic Mastocytosis
In this study, the investigators will determine the utility of Tamoxifen, a non-cytotoxic agent, to improve quality of life, biochemical parameters, and bone marrow involvement in systemic mastocytosis patients having 1) up to 40% bone marrow infiltration by mast cells and/or 2) mediator-release symptoms which are not controlled by tolerated doses of standard "non-cytotoxic" medications regardless of the percentage bone marrow involvement by mastocytosis. The dose of Tamoxifen will be 40 mg/day and the duration of treatment will be for one year. Patients currently taking interferon alfa, imatinib mesylate, or cladribine will be excluded until these medications have been stopped.
Systemic Mastocytosis
Stability or reduction of the percent bone marrow involvement by mastocytosis, including stable mast cell morphology and phenotype., up to 40% bone marrow infiltration by mast cells and/or 2) mediator-release symptoms which are not controlled by tolerated doses of standard "non-cytotoxic" medications regardless of the percentage bone marrow involvement by mastocytosis. The dose of Tamoxifen will be 40mg/day and the duration of treatment will be for one year., 1 year
Stability or improvement in biochemical markers of systemic mastocytosis, Stability or improvement in biochemical markers of systemic mastocytosis (serum tryptase, calcitonin, urinary N-methyl histamine and prostaglandin F2 excretion/24 hours, liver function studies, lactic dehydrogenase, complete blood count with leukocyte differential), 1 year
