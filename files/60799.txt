Treatment of MDS/AML Patients With an Impending Hematological Relapse With AZA or ATA and Pevonedistat
MDS/AML with MRD and impending relapse after allogeneic stem cell transplantation and/or conventional chemotherapy
Acute Myeloid Leukemia in Remission|Myelodysplastic Syndromes|Minimal Residual Disease
DRUG: Pevonedistat|DRUG: Azacitidine
Measurable residual disease (MRD) status after 3 months of treatment, To show that pevonedistat and azacitidine are more effective compared to azacitidine alone with regard to achievement of MRD negativity after 3 months of treatment.

MRD assessment is carried out as determination of the NPM1mut status or as CD34/CD117 chimerism analysis., 3 months after start of treatment
Overall Survival, To describe and compare outcome measures between two strategies: pevonedistat and azacitidine in combination versus azacitidine alone with cross over option., From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 25 months|Relapse Free Survival, To describe and compare outcome measures between two strategies: pevonedistat and azacitidine in combination versus azacitidine alone with cross over option., Time from randomization until hematological relapse or death from any cause (whichever comes first), assessed up to 25 Months.|Impact of treatment assessed by using the validated questionnaires EORTC QLQ-C30., To describe and compare outcome measures between two strategies: pevonedistat and azacitidine in combination versus azacitidine alone with cross over option., Time from randomization until hematological relapse or death from any cause (whichever comes first)|Impact of treatment assessed by using the validated questionnaires EQ-5D-5L., To describe and compare outcome measures between two strategies: pevonedistat and azacitidine in combination versus azacitidine alone with cross over option., Time from randomization until hematological relapse or death from any cause (whichever comes first), assessed up to 25 months.
Experimental arm: pevonedistat in combination with azacitidine Control arm: azacitidine alone

With the following modifications:

* Patients on the azacitidine arm and still MRD+ at 3 months but without hematological relapse can cross over to the combination arm
* Cross over into the combination arm is possible any time up to 9 months of study treatment if initially responding patients (at 3 months) on AZA monotherapy become MRD positive again
* Maximum treatment duration of 1 year
* Patients receive pevonedistat at 20 mg/m2 i.v. (d1,3,5, q4w); azacitidine is given at a standard dose of 75 mg/mÂ² i.v. or s.c. (d1-7 or 1-5,8,9, q4w)
