Early Diagnosis and Treatment of Sleep Disordered Breathing in Lung Cancer
Sleep-disordered breathing at night is a common medical problem. It leads to daytime fatigue, impairment in concentration and daily activities, and a higher risk of cardiovascular disease and life-threatening events. A particularly common form is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and it is usually treatable with a high rate of patient satisfaction and improved quality of life using a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device.

Treatment of this condition improves nighttime low-oxygen levels by ensuring patency of the upper airways. Research shows that in cancer, sleep disordered breathing is frequent. Low oxygen levels overnight may cause tumors to grow: tumors deprived of oxygen grow more blood vessels to try to get more oxygen, and growing more blood vessels makes the tumor grow. This study aims to examine how treating sleep-disordered breathing may lessen blood-flow to lung tumors, and thus serve to ultimately block tumor growth.

Participants of this study will undergo sleep study and receive CPAP therapy as a part of routine care.
