Drug Biomarkers in Cell Samples From Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia
RATIONALE: Studying cell samples from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer

PURPOSE: This research study is studying drug biomarkers in cell samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemia.
Leukemia
GENETIC: western blotting|OTHER: flow cytometry|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis
Activity of novel CD33-targeting immunoconjugate agents|Genotypic characteristics of acute myeloid leukemia cells
OBJECTIVES:

* To determine, in vitro, the cytotoxic activity of novel CD33-targeting immunoconjugate agents in cell samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
* To define the characteristics of AML cells responding to or resisting these agents.

OUTLINE: Cell samples are thawed and used for in vitro studies to determine the cytotoxic activity of novel CD33-targeting immunoconjugate agents, including gemtuzumab ozogamicin, for genotyping characterization by flow cytometry-based assays and/or western blot, and colony-forming cell assays.
