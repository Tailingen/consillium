A Study of Tilsotolimod in Combo With Ipilimumab vs Ipilimumab Alone in Subjects With Anti-PD-1 Refractory Melanoma
A Phase 3 comparison of ipilimumab with and without IMO-2125 in advanced melanoma
Metastatic Melanoma
DRUG: Ipilimumab|DRUG: Tilsotolimod with Ipilimumab
Summary of Independent Reviewer-Assessed Objective Response Rate (ORR) by RECIST v1.1, The ORR for evaluable participants was calculated using the participant's best overall response (BOR).

Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions as assessed by MRI, CT or X-ray: Complete Response (CR) - disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR) - \>=30% decrease from baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions; Stable Disease (SD) - does not qualify for CR, PR or Progression; Progressive Disease (PD) - 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions.

The calculation is derived from measuring the diameter (mm) of the target lesion at baseline and comparing target lesion diameter (mm) at intervals during treatment and/or post-treatment. Based on the percent of tumor decrease or increase, the appropriate category is assigned., Response is measured from the date of randomization, until disease progression, death, or start of new anti-cancer therapy (up to 36 months).|Summary of Overall Survival, Efficacy measured by overall survival (OS) was defined as the number of participants alive compared to the number of participants that died by treatment group., OS is measured from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause (up to 36 months).
A Phase 3 global, multi-center, open-label comparison of ipilimumab with and without intratumoral IMO-2125 in subjects with advanced melanoma who had confirmed disease progression while on anti-PD-1
