Photoscreening for Retinoblastoma
Retinoblastoma is the most common pediatric eye malignancy and manifests between 1 and 5 years of age. The tumor is most often diagnosed by leukocoria ( white reflex in the pupil). There is often a significant delay in diagnosis and early diagnosis enables good life prognosis and better vision outcome.There is currently not a standardized screening protocol for detection of retinoblastoma. Vision screening methods are recommended for children 3-5 years of age. The investigators are attempting to use instrument based screening started from birth to detect leukocoria.
