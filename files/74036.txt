Neoadjuvant S-1 and Concurrent Radiotherapy for Borderline Resectable Pancreatic Cancer
Multicenter Prospective Phase II Study for Neoadjuvant S-1 and Concurrent Radiotherapy for Borderline Resectable Pancreatic Cancer

RATIONALE: Borderline resectable pancreatic cancer is frequently related to a positive surgical margin and has a poor prognosis after resection. Neoadjuvant chemoradiation with intensive local effect may lead to substantial local control and prolongation of survival in borderline resectable pancreatic cancer.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial assess efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant S-1 and concurrent radiotherapy for borderline resectable pancreatic cancer.

Overall survival, up to 6 years|Disease-free survival, up to 6 years|Response rate after neoadjuvant chemoradiation, All responses will be measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v 1.1 within 4 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant therapy., Up to 4 years|Pathological response rate, Evaluation of the pathological response of the primary tumor was performed using a classification by Evans et al., Up to 4 years|2-year survival rate, up to 6 years|Surgical morbidity rates, Both Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 and Clavien-Dindo Classification will be used for all morbidity assessments., With in 90 days|Acute and late toxicity rates, All toxicities will be measured by CTCAE version 4.0., With in 6 months|R0 resection rate in borderline resectable pancreatic cancer, Diagnosis of borderline resectable pancreatic cancer will be fixed by Diagnostic Radiology Central Review., Up to 4 years
S-1: S-1 is an oral fluorinated pyrimidine agent which contains tegafur (FT, a prodrug of 5-FU), 5-chloro-2,4-dihydropyrimidine (CHDP) and potassium oxonate (Oxo) effective for gastric and various other types of cancers. S-1 is also active for pancreatic cancer: S-1 demonstrated non-inferiority to gemcitabine in overall survival for metastatic or locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC).

S-1 and Concurrent radiotherapy: S-1 therapy with concurrent radiation therapy (RT) had favorable activity with overall tumor response rate of 37%, as well as mild toxicity in patients with LAPC. The median survival time and the 2-year survival rate for LAPC patients treated by S-1/RT were 16.2 months and 26% respectively.

Definition of Borderline Resectable Pancreatic Cancer:(1) Reconstructible bilateral impingement of superior mesenteric vein or portal vein; (2) Tumor contact with the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) of \</= 180 degrees ; (3) Tumor contact with the common hepatic artery of \</= 180 degrees (at the root of the gastroduodenal artery); and (4) Tumor contact with the celiac axis of \</= 180 degrees.

Tumor with portal vein tumor thrombus and tumor contact with the second or further jejunal SMA branch are considered as unresectable. Tumor which is contact with the common hepatic artery or celiac axis but can be resected by distal pancreatectomy with en bloc celiac axis resection, is not included in this study.
