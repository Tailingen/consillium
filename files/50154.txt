A Clinical Investigation to Evaluate Microwave Imaging Via MammoWave® in a Population-based Screening Program for Early Breast Cancer Detection
This is an open, multicentric, interventional, prospective, non-randomized clinical investigation. The first aim of the study is to confirm that MammoWave reaches sensitivity\>75% and specificity\>90% in breast cancer (BC) detection on 10.000 volunteers undergoing regular screening programs.

DEVICE: MammoWave
MammoWave® sensitivity, MammoWave® sensitivity (percentage of 'true positive' results) while using an optimized classification algorithm. The Reference Standard is intended as the output of conventional breast examination path (i.e. screening mammogram, integrated with other radiological/histological output when deemed necessary by the responsible Investigator). Reference Standard may be: BC+ for the histology-confirmed and classified as BI-RADS 1,2 or 3., During the procedure|MammoWave® specificity, MammoWave® specificity (percentage of 'true negative' results) while using an optimized algorithm., During the procedure
Detection rates by type of lesion, Evaluation of the detection rates (sensitivity) according to the type of radiological finding (microcalcification, mass, asymmetry or architectural distortion group), also by breast density (according to BI-RADS ACR classification assigned by the radiologist), and comparison with the other standard screening and diagnostic modalities., During the baseline|Recall rate, Evaluation of MammoWave recalls, also by breast density (according to BI-RADS ACR classification assigned by the radiologist), and comparison with the other standard screening and diagnostic modalities., During the baseline|Positive-predictive value, Evaluation of MammoWave positive predictive value (for the biopsies performed), also by breast density (according to BI-RADS ACR classification assigned by the radiologist), and comparison with the other standard screening and diagnostic modalities., During the baseline|Program screening rate, Program screening rate, calculated as the proportion of women diagnosed with BC in the study population, During the baseline|BC detection rates of each by histological type and size of the BC and BI-RADS classification, also by breast density, BC detection rates of each by histological type and size of the BC and BI-RADS classification, also by breast density, During the baseline|MammoWave® sensitivity and specificity after retrospective AI adjustment using the data at the end of the study, Evaluation of the improvement in both sensitivity and specificity when retrospectively using AI algorithms for the evaluation of MammoWave® data after its further optimization with all data collected in the participants included in the study., During the baseline|Agreement between different evaluator (i.e. local versus central), Evaluation of the reproducibility of results comparing the lectures performed at the study centers and the centralized lectures, During the baseline|Volunteers' satisfaction questionnaire, Volunteers' satisfaction through a properly designed questionnaire collecting women's issues and plus during the exam with MammoWave® in the language spoken by the women, During the baseline
MammoWave is a non-CE marked device that uses low-power (1mW) microwaves (1-9 GHz) instead of ionizing radiation (X-ray) for BC screening. MammoWave uses safe low-power radio frequency signals in the microwave band; it is a Class IIa medical device (non-invasive device). The previous generation of MammoWave had obtained the CE mark; in this investigation, the device contains the same hardware and will be used with the same acquisition method as the CE marked device, but additional data processing software will be used.

The 10,000 volunteers undergoing conventional breast screening examination will also undergo the MammoWave exam. The MammoWave results (WSF: breast With Suspicious Finding,i.e. with suspicious lesion, or NSF: No Suspicious Finding, i.e. breast without lesion or with low suspicious lesion) will be checked against the Reference Standard, to be intended as the output of conventional breast examination path (i.e., screening mammogram, integrated with other radiological/histological output when deemed necessary by the responsible Investigator in each site). Reference Standard may be BC+ for the histology-confirmed breast cancer (BI-RADS 6); BC- otherwise (BI-RADS 1, 2, 3).

(NOTE: BIRADS 4 and 5 are only image suspicion criteria: when a biopsy is performed, BIRADS are transformed in 6 (BC+) or 1,2 and 3 (BC-))
