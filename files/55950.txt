PSMA PET Scan and mpMRI for Prostate Cancer Detection
Prospective, randomized, phase 2 clinical trial to determine if PSMA PET imaging plus mpMRI improves detection of clinically significant prostate cancer as compared to mpMRI alone.
Prostate Cancer Diagnosis
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: PSMA PET scan|OTHER: No PSMA PET|DRUG: 18F- DCFPyl Injection
Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer, Percentage of mpMRI and PSMA PET lesions positive for clinically significant prostate cancer, 12 weeks
Detection of Clinically Insignificant Prostate Cancer, Percentage of mpMRI and PSMA PET lesions positive for clinically insignificant prostate cancer., 12 weeks|Difference in PSMA PET and mpMRI Clinically Significant Cancer Detection, Percentage of PSMA PET only (mpMRI negative) and PSMA PET overlapping with mpMRI lesions positive for clinically significant prostate cancer., 12 weeks|Correlation of PSMA PET intensity with Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer, Correlate intensity of PSMA PET lesions with clinically significant prostate cancer., 12 weeks|Correlation of AI Measures with Aggressiveness of Prostate Cancer, Correlate artificial intelligence measurement(s) (miPSMA index) of PSMA lesion(s) with aggressiveness of prostate cancer, 12 weeks|Adverse Events Associated with 18F- DCFPyl, Safety - Patients will be monitored for adverse events during injection and for two hours after radiotracer administration., 12 weeks
This a prospective, randomized, phase 2 clinical trial. We will enroll patients who underwent mpMRI of the prostate as part of their standard clinical care, have PI-RADS 4, or 5 lesion(s) on mpMRI, and are scheduled to undergo fusion guided prostate biopsy. Subjects that sign the consent form will be randomized to undergo DCFPyL PET/CT imaging or no PSMA PET imaging prior to the prostate biopsy. In the PSMA scan cohort, decision for biopsy targets will be made based on the combination of the findings of mpMRI and PSMA scans. In the no PSMA scan (control) group, the biopsy will be performed based on mpMRI findings. Each patient will undergo 12 core systematic biopsy as the standard of care. Two additional biopsies for each mpMRI and PSMA PET and overlap lesion will also performed.
