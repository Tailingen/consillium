The purpose of this study is to estimate objective response rates (ORRs) of pembrolizumab + oxaliplatin + TS-1 and pembrolizumab + cisplatin + TS-1, as first-line treatment for gastric cancer in programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/neu)-negative participants with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma.
Gastric Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: TS-1|DRUG: Cisplatin
Objective Response Rate (ORR) According to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), For the primary efficacy analysis, ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who have a best response of complete response (CR, disappearance of all target lesions) or partial response (PR, at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters \[SOD\] of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline SOD) per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR., Up to ~36 months
ORR According to Immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (iRECIST) Assessed by BICR, For the secondary efficacy analysis, ORR was defined as the percentage of participants whose best response based on imaging is CR (disappearance of all target lesions) or PR (≥30% decrease in the SOD of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline SOD) according to iRECIST as assessed by BICR. iRECIST is a modification to RECIST that takes into account unique patterns of atypical response in immunotherapy and enables treatment beyond initial radiographic progression., Up to ~36 months|Duration of Response (DOR) According to RECIST 1.1 Assessed by BICR, For participants who demonstrated complete response (CR, disappearance of all target lesions) or partial response (PR, ≥30% decrease in the SOD of target lesions) according to RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR, DOR was defined as the time from the earliest date of qualifying response (CR or PR) until earliest date of progressive disease (PD, ≥20% increase in the SOD of target lesions) or death from any cause, whichever came first. DOR was censored at the last tumor assessment date if a responder did not have PD or death., Up to ~36 months|DOR According to iRECIST Assessed by BICR, For participants who demonstrated complete response (CR, disappearance of all target lesions) or partial response (PR, ≥30% decrease in the SOD of target lesions) according to iRECIST as assessed by BICR, DOR was defined as the time from the earliest date of qualifying response (CR or PR) until earliest date of progressive disease (PD, ≥20% increase in the SOD of target lesions) or death from any cause, whichever came first. DOR was censored at the last tumor assessment date if a responder did not have PD or death. iRECIST is a modification to RECIST that takes into account unique patterns of atypical response in immunotherapy and enables treatment beyond initial radiographic progression., Up to ~36 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR) According to RECIST 1.1 Assessed by BICR, DCR was defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who have complete response (CR, disappearance of all target lesions), partial response (PR (≥30% decrease in the SOD of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline SOD), or stable disease (SD, neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD, ≥20% increase in the SOD of target lesions\]). Responses are according to RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR., Up to ~36 months|DCR According to iRECIST 1.1 Assessed by BICR, DCR was defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who have CR (disappearance of all target lesions), PR (≥30% decrease in the SOD of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline SOD), or stable disease (SD, neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD \[≥20% increase in the SOD of target lesions\]). Responses are according to iRECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR. iRECIST is a modification to RECIST that takes into account unique patterns of atypical response in immunotherapy and enables treatment beyond initial radiographic progression., Up to ~36 months|Time to Response (TTR) According to RECIST 1.1 Assessed by BICR, TTR was defined as the time from the date of enrollment day to the first date of confirmed CR (disappearance of all target lesions) or PR (≥30% decrease in the SOD of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline SOD). Responses are according to RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR., Up to ~36 months|TTR According to iRECIST 1.1 Assessed by BICR, TTR was defined as the time from the date of enrollment day to the first date of confirmed CR (disappearance of all target lesions) or PR (≥30% decrease in the SOD of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline SOD). Responses are according to iRECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR. iRECIST is a modification to RECIST that takes into account unique patterns of atypical response in immunotherapy and enables treatment beyond initial radiographic progression., Up to ~36 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS) According to RECIST 1.1 Assessed by BICR, PFS was defined as the time from the date of enrollment day to the first documented PD (defined as ≥20% increase in the SOD of target lesions) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Responses are according to RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR., Up to ~36 months|PFS According to iRECIST 1.1 Assessed by BICR, PFS was defined as the time from the date of enrollment day to the first documented PD (defined as ≥20% increase in the SOD of target lesions) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Responses are according to iRECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR. iRECIST is a modification to RECIST that takes into account unique patterns of atypical response in immunotherapy and enables treatment beyond initial radiographic progression., Up to ~36 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from the date of enrollment day to death due to any cause. Participants without documented death at the time of the final analysis were censored at the date of the last follow-up. For these participants, date of last follow up was last visit date instead of death date., Up to ~36 months|Number of Participants With ≥1 Adverse Event (AE), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant that is temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study treatment, Up to ~36 months|Number of Participants Discontinuing From Study Treatment Due to AE(s), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant that is temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study treatment., Up to ~36 months
Approximately 45 participants will be assigned to pembrolizumab + oxaliplatin + TS-1 combination therapy (Cohort 1) first, and then 45 participants will be assigned to pembrolizumab + cisplatin + TS-1 combination therapy (Cohort 2).
