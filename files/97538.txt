Phase 1b Multicenter Study of Carfilzomib With Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone in Relapsed Multiple Myeloma
To evaluate the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of carfilzomib in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma
Relapsed Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Carfilzomib|DRUG: Lenalidomide|DRUG: Dexamethasone
Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), Treatment-related are those AEs with possible or probable relationship to carfilzomib, lenalidomide or dexamethasone as assessed by the Investigator. The severity of each adverse event was graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 3.0, per the following: Grade 1 = Mild, Grade 2 = Moderate, Grade 3 = Severe, Grade 4 = Life-threatening and Grade 5 = Death.

Serious adverse events were defined as AEs meeting one of the following: death, life-threatening, required or prolonged in-patient hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of an exposed participant, important medical events that may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above, or pregnancy or suspected pregnancy., From the first dose of study drug until 30 days after the last dose; 1 to 52 months, with an average of 12 months.|Number of Participants With Dose-limiting Toxicities, Dose-limiting toxicity was defined as any of the following events assessed as related to carfilzomib, lenalidomide, or dexamethasone: Nonhematologic

* ≥ Grade 2 neuropathy with pain
* ≥ Grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity (excluding nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hyperglycemia due to dexamethasone, and rash due to lenalidomide)
* ≥ Grade 3 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea uncontrolled by maximal supportive therapy
* ≥ Grade 4 fatigue persisting \> 7 days
* Treatment delay for toxicity \> 21 days

Hematologic

* Grade 4 neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count \[ANC\] \< 500/mm³) \> 7 days
* Febrile neutropenia (ANC \< 1,000/mm³ with fever ≥ 38.3ºC)
* Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets \< 25,000/mm³) for \> 7 days despite holding treatment, or Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia associated with bleeding
* Treatment delay for toxicity \> 21 days.

The maximum-tolerated dose was defined as the dose level below which a drug-related DLT was observed in ≥ 33% of participants in a cohort., Cycle 1, 28 days
