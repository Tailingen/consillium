Temsirolimus and Radiation for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
To determine the maximum tolerated dose of the drug temsirolimus given with radiation therapy for patients with non-small cell lung cancer.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
DRUG: Temsirolimus|RADIATION: Radiation therapy
Determine the maximum tolerate dose of temsirolimus given with radiation, Treatment lasts approximately 4 weeks, 90 days after completion of all patients on treatment
Determine the dose limiting toxicities of temsirolimus and radiation in NSCLC patients, Treatment lasts approximately 4 weeks, 90 days after completion of treatment|Describe phospho-Akt and phospho-S6 levels in circulating mononuclear cells before and after treatment., Prior to initial temsirolimus dose, one hour post completion of initial temsirolimus dose, and prior to second temsirolimus dose|Safety of the regimen in patients with NSCLC, Treatment lasts approximately 4 weeks, 90 days after completion of treatment
Temsirolimus has demonstrated anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic activity in multiple epithelial cancers, is well-tolerated, has non-overlapping toxicities with radiation, and has been shown to potentiate the effects of radiation in vitro. Locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer is cured in a minority of patients with concurrent chemoradiation but newer agents are needed. In this study temsirolimus will be studied in combination with radiation in a phase I setting to establish safety.
