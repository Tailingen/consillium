The Registration Program of BRCA1/2 Gene
Purpose:

1. Screening of large samples is to search the gene mutation of the breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA1 and BRCA2) in Chinese high risk group.
2. To build the breast cancer BRCA1/2 mutation database of Chinese group.
3. To build the hazard model of breast cancer BRCA1/2 mutation of Chinese group.
Breast Cancer
GENETIC: NGS test
Screening of large samples is to search the gene mutation of the breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA1 and BRCA2) in Chinese high risk group., About 2 years
To build the database of the Chinese breast cancer BRCA1/2 mutation., About 2 years|To build the hazard model of Chinese breast cancer BRCA1/2 mutation., About 2 years
It is the first large-scale and systematic study that fully recognize and review on the mutation spectrum of BRCA1/2 and the risk of Breast cancer in Chinese high risk group, it will be a Landmark research of susceptibility genes in Chinese breast cancer.
