A Phase 2 Study of Lenalidomide in Patients With Relapsed or Recurrent Adult T-cell Leukemia-lymphoma
To evaluate the efficacy of lenalidomide in patients with Adult T-cell Leukemia-lymphoma (ATL) who have previously received chemotherapy for ATL.
Adult T-Cell Leukemia-Lymphoma
DRUG: Lenalidomide
Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a Complete Response, Unconfirmed Complete Response, or Partial Response as Assessed by the Efficacy-Safety Evaluation Committee (ESEC), ORR is a Complete Response (CR) + Complete Response unconfirmed (CRu) + Partial Response (PR). A CR requires that target lesions have regressed to normal; nodal non-target lesions have regressed to normal; extranodal non-target lesions have disappeared; hepatomegaly/splenomegaly has disappeared; skin findings are GR 0; peripheral blood is normal; Bone marrow (BM) infiltration is negative and no new lesions. A CRu requires the sum of the product diameters (SPD) of target lesions have decreased by at least 75% from baseline; nodal non-target lesions have regressed to normal size; extranodal non-target lesions have disappeared; hepatomegaly/splenomegaly has disappeared; skin findings are Grade 0; peripheral blood is normal; BM infiltration is "negative" and no new lesions. A PR requires the SPD of target lesions has decreased by at least 50% from baseline; all nodal non-target lesions have regressed to normal or show no increase in size; all extranodal non-target lesions have disappeared, From day 1 of study treatment to date of first documented CR, CRU or PR; Up to data cut-off date of 19 May 2017; maximum study duration was 134.1 weeks
Kaplan Meier Estimate of Progression Free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by the ESEC, PFS was defined as the time from the first dose of study treatment to progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause on study or within 28 days after study discontinuation, whichever occurred earlier., From day 1 of study treatment to the date of disease progression; up to data cut date of date of 19 May 2017; maximum study duration was 134.1 weeks|Kaplan-Meier Estimate of Time to Progression (TTP), Time to progression was calculated as the time from the first dosing of study treatment to the first documented PD and assessed by the ESEC, From day 1 of study treatment to the date of disease progression; up to data cut date of 19 May 2017; maximum study duration was 134.1 weeks|Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events, Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE) was defined as any AE occurring on or after the start of study treatment and within 28 days after the last dose. Severity was assessed using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (NCI CTCAE v4.0): Grade 1= Mild Grade 2= Moderate Grade 3= Severe Grade 4= Life-threatening and Grade 5= Death related to AE. Serious AEs (SAEs) were those that resulted in death, were life-threatening, required or prolonged inpatient hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly, or resulted in an important medical event that may have jeopardized the patient or required medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above., From the date of the first dose of study drug up to 28 days after the last dose of study drug; up to data cutoff date of 19 May 2017; maximum treatment duration was 130.1 weeks|Kaplan-Meier Estimate of Duration of Response (DOR) for Responders as Assessed by the ESEC, The response duration in participants with an objective response was measured from the date of the first Complete Response or Complete Response unconfirmed or Partial Response to the first date of Relapsed Disease or Progressive Disease (PD). For participants who did not progress during the study, DOR was censored at the last adequate response assessment not showing evidence of PD., From day 1 of study treatment to first documented response; up to data cut-off date of 19 May 2017; Maximum study duration was 134.1 Weeks|Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a Complete Response, Unconfirmed Complete Response (CRu), Partial Response or Stable Disease (SD) as Assessed by the ESEC, The tumor control rate was measured for those with a response of Complete Remission, + CRu, + PR + Stable Disease (SD) in the EE population based on the best response., From day 1 of study treatment to first documented response; up to data cut-off date of 19 May 2017; maximum study duration was 134.1 weeks|Kaplan-Meier Estimate for Overall Survival, Overall Survival was defined as the time from the start of study treatment to the death due to any cause. For participants who were still alive at the time of the data cutoff, survival data were censored at the latest available date the participant was known to be alive., From Day 1 of study treatment to disease progression or death; up to final data cut-off date of 19 May 2017; maximum surivival time was 197.9 weeks
Time to Response, Time to Response was defined as the time from the first dose of study treatment to the initial documented response (CR or CRu, or PR), From day 1 of study treatment to first documented response; up to data cut-off date of 19 May 2017; maximum study duration was 134.1 weeks
