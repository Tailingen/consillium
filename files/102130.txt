Dendritic Cell Based Therapy of Metastatic Breast Cancer
The study aim to show if vaccination with autologous dendritic cells pulsed with onco-peptides in combination with adjuvant cytokine can induce a measurable immune response in patients with metastatic breast cancer, and to evaluate the clinical effect (objective response rate) of the vaccination regime.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Onco-peptide loaded autologous dendritic cells
Primary aim of the study is to evaluate tolerability and safety of the treatment.
Secondary aims: evaluation of treatment induced immune response and clinical response.
HLA A2 positive patients are treated with PADRE and oncopeptide pulsed DC; p53, survivin and telomerase peptides. Each patient is given 6 immunizations with at least 5x106 peptide/lysate pulsed autologous DC. Vaccination 1-4 is given weekly and 4-6 at 2-week intervals. Those patients who exhibit stable disease, partial response or complete response after 6 injections will be given 4 more vaccinations at 2-week interval. The vaccine is applied by either intranodal or intradermal injection near the inguinal region. For adjuvant used IL-2 2 MIU sc. day 2-6. Scans and re-staging tests are performed at scheduled intervals throughout the study.
