Phase 1b/2 Study of Futibatinib in Combination With Binimetinib in Patients With Advanced KRAS Mutant Cancer
Phase 1b/2 study to evaluate the FGFRi futibatinib in combination with the MEKi binimetinib in patients with advanced KRASmt tumors.
Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors Irrespective of Gene Alterations|Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer|KRAS Gene Mutation
DRUG: Futibatinib and Binimetinib
Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) in Part 1, Determine RP2D of futibatinib in combination with binimetinib based on Dose Limiting Toxicities, 12 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR) in Part 2, proportion of patients who have achieved a PR or complete response (CR) according to RECIST 1.1., approximately 24 months
Pharmacokinetics (PK): Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of futibatinib, binimetinib, and AR00426032, Plasma concentrations of futibatinib, binimetinib, and AR00426032, approximately 24 months|PK: Area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of futibatinib, binimetinib, and AR00426032, Plasma concentrations of futibatinib, binimetinib, and AR00426032, approximately 24 months|PK: Time to reach maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) of futibatinib, binimetinib, and AR00426032, Plasma concentrations of futibatinib, binimetinib, and AR00426032, approximately 24 months|PK: Terminal elimination half-life (T1/2) of futibatinib, binimetinib, and AR00426032, Plasma concentrations of futibatinib, binimetinib, and AR00426032, approximately 24 months|PK: Minimum plasma concentration before administration (Cmin) of futibatinib, binimetinib, and AR00426032, Plasma concentrations of futibatinib, binimetinib, and AR00426032, approximately 24 months|PK: Accumulation ratio of Cmax and AUC (R) of futibatinib, binimetinib, and AR00426032, Plasma concentrations of futibatinib, binimetinib, and AR00426032, approximately 24 months|Duration of response (DOR), DOR is defined as the length of time between first response and the date of objectively documented progression of disease or death, approximately 24 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from date of first dose to objectively documented progression of disease or death, approximately 24 months|Disease control rate (DCR) at 24 months, DCR is defined as the percentage of patients who have achieved a CR, PR, or SD., approximately 24 months|Number of patients with treatment-emergent adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, Evaluate safety and tolerability of futibatinib in combination with binimetinib based on treatment-emergent adverse events per CTCAE v5.0(including serious adverse events),clinical laboratory parameters, ECGs, and vital signs, Approximately 24 months
This is an open-label, nonrandomized, uncontrolled Phase 1b/2 study to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of futibatinib in combination with binimetinib and to explore the preliminary antitumor activity of futibatinib in combination with binimetinib in patients with advanced KRASmt tumors.

The study will consist of two parts:

* Part 1: Dose-Escalation part to determine the RP2D and dosing schedule of futibatinib in combination with binimetinib in patients with advanced cancer disease
* Part 2: Dose-Expansion part to evaluate the preliminary antitumor activity of futibatinib in combination with binimetinib at the RP2D in patients with advanced KRASmt NSCLC

Patients will receive study treatment until progressive disease or any other discontinuation or withdrawal criterion is met.

No patients were enrolled in Phase 2 as the Sponsor decided to not proceed with the dose expansion Phase 2 part of the TAS-120-204 study.
