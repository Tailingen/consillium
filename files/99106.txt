Tipifarnib in Subjects With Myelodysplastic Syndromes
This is a Phase 2 randomized, open-label, two-stage study designed to investigate the antitumor activity of tipifarnib in approximately 36 eligible subjects with MDS who have no known curative treatment. Subjects will be randomized to receive tipifarnib orally with food according to one of 2 treatment regimens.
Myelodysplastic Syndromes
DRUG: Tipifarnib
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was assessed by the investigator and included complete response (CR), partial response (PR), marrow complete remission (MR), and hematologic improvement (HI) according to the MDS International Working Group (IWG) criteria., 1 year
Rate of Transfusion Independence, Rate of transfusion independence is defined as number of participants with transfusion independence at any response assessment over 1 year., 1 year|Duration of Transfusion Independence, Duration of transfusion independence is defined as the period of time where participants achieved transfusion independence., 1 year|Hematologic Improvement, Number of subjects who experienced hematologic improvements (erythroid response, platelet response, or neutrophil response)., 1 year|Duration of Response, Duration of response is defined as the number of days from the start date of response (whichever response is achieved first) to the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented., 1 year|Progression-free Survival (PFS) at 1 Year, PFS is defined as the time (in months) from enrollment to either first observation of progressive disease or occurrence of death due to any cause within 1 year (approximately 4 time intervals for disease assessments) of either first administration of tipifarnib or the last disease assessment., 1 year|Overall Survival (OS) at 1 Year, OS is defined as the time (in months) from enrollment to occurrence of death due to any cause within 1 year (approximately 4 time intervals for disease assessments) of either first administration of tipifarnib or the last disease assessment., 1 year|Number of Participants Who Experienced Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), TEAEs are defined as AEs that started on or after the first dose of study drug and within approximately 30 days of the last administration of study drug. AEs were summarized by the number and percentage of subjects who experienced the event, according to system organ class and preferred term. A subject reporting multiple cases of the same AE will be counted once within each system organ class and similarly counted once within each preferred term., 1 year
This Phase 2 study will investigate the antitumor activity in terms of ORR of tipifarnib in approximately 36 eligible subjects with MDS who have no known curative treatment. Eligible subjects may have received no more than 2 prior systemic regimens. Subjects will be randomized to receive tipifarnib orally with food according to one of 2 dose regimens. In the absence of unmanageable toxicities, subjects may continue to receive tipifarnib treatment until disease progression.

Disease assessments will be performed at screening and at least once every approximately 12 weeks starting at the end of cycle 3. Determination of ORR will be assessed by the Investigator according to the MDS International Working Group (IWG) criteria (Cheson 2006). Upon disease progression, all subjects in the study will be followed approximately every 12 weeks for survival and the use of subsequent therapy until either death or 12 months after accrual of the study has been completed, whichever occurs first.
