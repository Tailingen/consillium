Correlation of Molecular Markers With Response to Therapy and Breast Cancer Behavior
RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue and blood from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors predict how patients will respond to treatment.

PURPOSE: This research study is looking at tissue and blood samples from women with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer
Breast Cancer
OTHER: biologic sample preservation procedure|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis|PROCEDURE: biopsy
Generation of a biorepository for current and future correlative research studies, Diagnosis, between treatments,7-14 days after start of treatment and at time of definitive therapy
OBJECTIVES:

* Collect , catalogue, and store biological specimens from patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer
* To collect clinical data from these patients containing identifiers, demographics, epidemiologic review, clinical evaluation, treatment, and long-term follow-up.
* To provide an efficient bi-directional flow of clinical information and specimens between laboratory and clinical scientists in order to foster innovative translational research.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients undergo core biopsy and blood sampling at diagnosis, between chemotherapy regimens, and prior to definitive surgery. Tumor markers are assessed using immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 500 patients will be accrued for this study.
