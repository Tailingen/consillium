PET-CT Imaging Using FDG-labeled Human Erythrocytes in Breast Cancer Patient
This is a single arm, phase 0 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PET-CT scans with FDG-labeled RBC in patients with breast cancer.

Cardiac ejection fraction can be calculated and monitored in breast cancer patients during chemotherapy using a FDG-RBC PET-CT scan. The purpose of this study is to determine if calculated cardiac ejection fraction shows high concordance with results from echocardiography.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Fluoro-D-glucose-positron Emission Tomography|BIOLOGICAL: 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG)|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Echocardiogram
Cardiac Ejection Fraction (EF), Calculated cardiac ejection fraction (EF) with a low radiation dose FDG-RBC PET-computed tomography (CT) scan before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy., Up to 12 months
Concordance Between FDG-RBC PET-CT and Echocardiogram, The concordance will be estimated by the use of Lin's method49 along with 95% confidence interval., Pre-treatment and Post-treatment, up to 12 months
