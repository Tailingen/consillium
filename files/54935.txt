Total Neoadjuvant Therapy for Adenocarcinoma of the OESophagus and Oesophagogastric Junction: TNT-OES-2 Trial
Both neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CROSS) and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (FLOT) have demonstrated overall survival benefit over surgery alone in esophageal and esophagogastric junction (EGJ) cancer. Despite these survival gains, the prognosis remains poor, especially in patients with nodal-positive adenocarcinoma (cN+ AC) (5-year survival 36%, compared to 55% for cN0). This highlights the need for more effective treatment options, and justifies treatment intensification in these patients.

The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy and feasibility of TNT FLOT-CROSS and TNT CROSS-FLOT in patients with resectable, cN+ AC of the esophagus or EGJ.

This study hypothesize that the benefits of the locoregional control of CROSS combined with the systemic effect of FLOT lead to better disease control and survival in cN+ AC patients. This Total Neoadjuvant Treatment (TNT) strategy was found to be feasible in the previous TNT-OES-1 trial. The optimal sequence of CROSS and FLOT is yet unknown. Therefore, the hypothesis of this study is that the disease-free survival (DFS) of patients treated with TNT FLOT-CROSS and TNT CROSS-FLOT will be ≥10% compared to the DFS after CROSS in an appropriate historical cohort.
