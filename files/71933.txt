PRIORITY-CONNECT 2 Pilot Trial
The provision of preoperative interventions (prehabilitation: including exercise, nutrition, and psychological treatment) have been reported to reduce postoperative complications by as much as 50% and reduce hospital stay by up to 4 days compared to standard of care. Postoperative multimodal interventions are likely to further benefit patients facing new challenges (e.g. stoma care), and reduce post discharge complications.

Therefore the Virtual Multimodal hub of PRIORITY-CONNECT 2 Pilot Trial aims to primarily; determine the feasibility of incorporating a virtual multimodal program into the preoperative and postoperative period for patients undergoing gastrointestinal cancer surgery, the acceptability to patients, clinicians and carers of the virtual multimodal program and the acceptability to patients of being randomised to the virtual multimodal program or usual care.

The secondary aim is to obtain pilot data on the likely difference in key outcomes (30 days postoperative complications, quality of life, days at home and alive at 30 days - DAH30, implementation outcomes and cost outcomes) to inform the development of a substantive randomised clinical trial.

Feasibility of the virtual multimodal hub determined by number of eligible participants, retention rate and adherence rates, Feasibility will be determined by the following outcomes:

(i) Number of eligible participants recruited to the pilot trial; (ii) Retention rate: defined as the percentage of participants who completed the trial; (iii) Adherence rates: defined as the percentage of planned sessions attended by those who were randomised to the intervention group., through study completion, an average of 1 year|Acceptability of the virtual multimodal hub., Patients, clinicians and carers acceptability to the virtual multimodal hub (Intervention) will be assessed with a semi-structured questionnaire administered at 3-months (last survey). The semi- structured questionnaire contains 11 questions and participants (Patients, clinicians and carers) will be instructed to use a 5-point Likert Scale to express how much they agree or disagree with each statement. In addition, patients will be asked how satisfied they were with the virtual multimodal program and if the program negatively affected them. The investigators have also taken the opportunity to seek further feedback about the virtual multimodal hub (open ended question). The questionnaire has been used on previous pilot trials., 3 months, through study completion, an average of 1 year
Postoperative complications within 30 days after surgery, Defined as any deviation from the normal postoperative course and classified according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. The risk of developing complications following gastrointestinal cancer surgery is highest in the first 30-days after surgery; this is a critical determinant of recovery, long-term outcomes, and gastrointestinal cancer treatment costs., 30 days after surgery|Quality of life outcome EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-C30 (European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire) is a 30-item cancer-specific tool measuring five functioning scales, nine symptom scales, financial impact and overall QoL. This tool is a common (excellent reliability and validity) QoL tool for gastrointestinal cancer patients. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level. Thus a high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems., Measured at baseline, 1-2 day(s) before surgery, day of hospital discharge, 1- and 3-months post index surgery.|Quality of life outcome EORTC QLQ-OG25, EORTC QLQ-OG25 (European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire) is a 25-item tool measuring function and symptoms specific to oesophoago-gastric cancer. This tool is a common (excellent reliability and validity) QoL tool for gastrointestinal cancer patients. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level. Thus a high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems., Measured at baseline, 1-2 day(s) before surgery, day of hospital discharge, 1- and 3-months post index surgery.|Quality of life outcome EORTC QLQ-CR29, EORTC QLQ-CR29 (European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire) is a 29-item tool measuring function and symptoms specific to colorectal cancer. This tool is a common (excellent reliability and validity) QoL tool for gastrointestinal cancer patients. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level. Thus a high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems., Measured at baseline, 1-2 day(s) before surgery, day of hospital discharge, 1- and 3-months post index surgery.|Number of days at home within 30 and 90 days of surgery, DAH-30, 90 (days at home 30, 90): Validated (Australian population) patient-centred outcome metrics that integrates length of hospital stay, discharge destination (other than home), hospital readmission and early death. The number of days at home - reduced by complications, discharge to a care facility, re-admission, and death is quantified as the days alive and at home during the 30 days after surgery. DAH-30, 90 is calculated using mortality and hospitalisation data from the date of the index surgery (= Day 0)., days at home within 30 and 90 days of surgery|Resource use, (Costs): Patient and health system resource use, including the cost of the virtual multimodal hub interventions, hospitalisations, will be collected (surveys) from randomisation (1-6 weeks prior to surgery) to 3 months post index surgery., 1-6 weeks prior to surgery to 3 months post index surgery.|Implementation Outcome: Reach, RE-AIM Framework, including:
