Phase II Study of Concurrent C225, Cisplatin and Radiation in Stage IV Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck
RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as cetuximab can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Cetuximab may make the tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Giving monoclonal antibody therapy together with chemoradiotherapy may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving cetuximab and cisplatin together with radiation therapy works in treating patients with locally advanced or regional stage IV head and neck cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.
Head and Neck Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: cetuximab C225|DRUG: cisplatin|RADIATION: radiation therapy
2-year Progression-free Survival Rate, Two-year progression-free survival rate was defined as the proportion of patients that were alive progression-free two years after registration into the study. Disease progression was assessed per modified RECIST criteria, and defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions, in either primary or nodal lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since the baseline measurements, or the appearance of new lesions. Kaplan-Meier estimate of 2-year progression-free survival was calculated in the 60 eligible and treated patients., assessed every 3 months for 2 years
2-year Overall Survival Rate, Overall survival was defined as time from registration to death from any cause. Patients alive at last follow-up were censored. The 2-year overall survival rate was defined as the percentage of patients that were still alive two years after registration into the study. Kaplan-Meier estimate of 2-year overall survival was calculated in the 60 eligible and treated patients., assessed very 3 months for 2 years|Overall Response Rate, Response was assessed per Response Evaluation in Solid Tumor (RECIST) criteria by physical assessment and CT. Overall response = complete response (CR) + partial response (PR). CR was defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions, along with non-progressive disease of non-target lesions. Overall response rate (i.e., proportion of patients who had CR or PR) and the corresponding 90% confidence intervals were calculated for the 60 eligible and treated patients, assessed after all chemoradiation therapy completed Week 9, then every 3 months on C225 maintenance therapy, and every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months post-treatment 2 years from study entry
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine 2-year progression-free survival in patients with unresectable locally advanced or regional stage IV squamous cell or undifferentiated carcinoma of the head and neck treated with cetuximab, cisplatin, and definitive radiotherapy.

Secondary

* Determine response rate and overall survival in patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.
* Correlate epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression by immunohistochemistry, EGFR phosphorylation, map kinase, Akt, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and other tissue and serum tests with toxicity of this regimen and outcomes in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to tumor site (hypopharynx vs. oropharynx vs. oral cavity vs. larynx), primary tumor stage (T1-3 vs. T4), and nodal status (N0 vs. N1 vs. N2-3).

* Cetuximab therapy: Patients receive an initial loading dose of cetuximab IV over 2 hours on day 1. Patients then receive cetuximab IV over 1 hour on days 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43, 50, and 57.
* Chemoradiotherapy: Beginning on day 15 of cetuximab therapy, patients undergo radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for at least 7 weeks. Patients also receive cisplatin IV over 1-2 hours on days 15, 36, and 57.
* Cetuximab maintenance therapy: After the completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients continue to receive cetuximab IV over 1 hour once weekly for 6-12 months.

Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients are followed every 6 months for 10 years.

ACCRUAL: A total of 69 patients were accrued for this study.
