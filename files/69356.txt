It includes a 30-item questionnaire designed to assess health related quality of life in cancer patients. There are 9 multi-item scales: 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social); 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea and vomiting); and a global health and quality-of-life scale. Several single-item symptom measures are also included (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite, constipation, diarrhea, and financial impact). A linear transformation was applied to the raw scores so that all transformed scores lie between 0 to 100. A high score for a functional scale represents a high (healthy/better) level of functioning, a high score for the global health status represents a high (better) quality of life, but a high score for a symptom scale represents a high (worse) level of symptoms/problems., At the end of Cycle 2 and Cycle 42 (each cycle is 28 days).
A Phase 1b Study of ACP-196 in Combination with Obinutuzumab for Participants with Relapsed/Refractory or Untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/ small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL)/ prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL).

Study started with two cohorts, on Acalabrutinib and Obinutuzumab, cohort 1 for relapsed or refractory participants and cohort 2 for treatment naïve participants. Then for longer survival data and combination therapy, two new cohorts added to the study, cohort 3 with relapsed or refractory participants on Acalabrutinib, Rituximab and Venetoclax, and cohort 4 with treatment naïve participants on Acalabrutinib, Obinutuzumab and Venetoclax.

Primary endpoints: For Cohorts 1 and 2, the ORR (PR or better) at the 12-month response assessment will be calculated and 95% exact binomial confidence interval (CIs) will be provided. For Cohorts 1 to 4, toxicities will be tabulated by type and grade using NCI-CTCAE (National Cancer Institute - Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) version 4.03 criteria or higher and displayed in summary form.

Currently, study is in maintenance phase and we don't expect a major change in the near future.
