Effects of Mindfulness Meditation and Stress Management After Breast Cancer
The primary aim of this study is to examine the effects of a mindfulness-based stress reduction training program, delivered in individual web-based sessions, among breast cancer patients. The objectives are to study and answer questions regarding effects of the such training in a randomized controlled trial including the following outcome measures: physical and mental health status, perceived stress, post-traumatic stress symptoms, psychological well-being, and sleep quality. In addition to the primary aim, the investigators plan to explore potential mechanisms through which mindfulness training lead to improvement in perceived stress, well-being and sleep-quality. This will be studied by mediational analyses.
