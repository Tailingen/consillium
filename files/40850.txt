68Ga-HA-DOTATATE Imaging of Suspected Somatostatin Receptor Positive Tumors
Somatostatin receptor (SSR) imaging is a critical component of clinical care for many patients being investigated for or with confirmed SSR positive tumors. In the past, 111In-octreotide imaging has been used for this purpose but it has been recently supplanted globally by SSR positron emission tomography (PET) imaging due to better image quality and higher diagnostic accuracy.

This study will assess the safety and diagnostic effectiveness of 68Ga-HA-DOTATATE produced a the Edmonton Radiopharmaceutical Centre (ERC).
Neuroendocrine Tumors
DRUG: 68Ga-HA-DOTATATE
Efficacy - sensitivity, Sensitivity of 68Ga-HA-DOTATATE PET/CT compared to 1 year clinical follow-up, 1 year post-scan|Efficacy - specificity, Specificity of 68Ga-HA-DOTATATE PET/CT compared to 1 year clinical follow-up, 1 year post-scan
Safety - adverse events - immediate, Assessment of adverse events immediately after tracer injection, Immediately (within 15 minutes) after tracer injection|Safety - adverse events - post-scan, Assessment of adverse events immediately after PET/CT scan, Immediately (within 15 minutes) after PET/CT scan; 60 to 100 minutes after tracer injection|Safety - adverse events - delayed, Self-reporting of possible adverse events after leaving the PET department, 10 days after tracer injection
A single centre non-randomized, non-blinded phase II prospective cohort study evaluating the safety and efficacy of 68Ga-HA-DOTATATE PET/CT imaging in patients with known or suspected somatostatin receptor positive tumors.

Up to 600 scans will be included over 6 years. All patient ages (pediatric and adult) will be included. Individual patients may have more than one scan during the study period.

Safety evaluation will consist of an adverse event assessment whil in the Nuclear Medicine department at the University of Alberta Hospital. Efficacy evaluation will consist of a comparison to CT and/or MRI accuracy based on 1 year follow-up clinical evaluation.
