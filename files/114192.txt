A Study of of MORAb-004 in Subjects With Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of multiple intravenous infusions of MORAb-004.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: MORAb-004 (monoclonal antibody to TEM1)
To determine the safety of multiple intravenous infusions of MORAb-004, Safety is evaluated by clinical assessment, monitoring of adverse events, laboratory evaluations, ECG., Weekly while receiving study drug

MORAb-004 is a monoclonal antibody directed against endosialin, a cell surface glycoprotein, which is expressed on cells involved in tumor vasculature. Studies have found endosialin to play a key role in tumor growth and neovessel formation in numerous cancer types including (but not limited to) renal, breast, colon, pancreatic, lung, endometrial, ovarian, melanoma, sarcoma, and neuroectodermal tumors. Preclinical pharmacological studies have shown that MORAb-004 is a potentially useful anti-cancer agent. This clinical trial is being performed to determine the safety of MORAb-004 in subjects with solid tumors, as well as to establish serum pharmacokinetics of the antibody, and to assess tumor antigens that may serve as predictors of a response to MORAb-004. Study Part 2 was added to enroll subjects with specific histological diagnoses (colorectal cancer and soft tissue sarcoma) to further characterize the safety and tolerability of 5 dose levels of MORAb-004 previously tested during the dose escalation in Part 1.
