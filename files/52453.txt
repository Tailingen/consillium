Evaluating AlloMax in Immediate Expander-Based Breast Reconstruction Study
The study is a prospective multi-centered cohort study designed to determine the safety and efficacy of AlloMax in immediate expander-based breast reconstruction. Specifically, the study is designed to determine if sterility of human acellular dermal matrix results in a lower incidence of infection and seroma. The study will determine if gamma radiation, as a method of terminally sterilizing human acellular dermal matrix, has a negative impact on graft incorporation into the host tissue.
