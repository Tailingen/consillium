Radiotherapy Combined With Immunochemotherapy in Metastatic Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
SCR-ESCC-01 is a multicenter, randomized, phase II study aiming to investigate the benefit of early involvement of low-dose radiotherapy(LDRT) and conventionally fractionated radiotherapy(CFRT) in the first-line anti-PD-1 based treatment of metastatic ESCC.

In metastatic esophageal cancer, radiotherapy is often administered for palliative purposes to alleviate the symptom of dysphagia. Recent studies have shown that the combination of radiotherapy and immunotherapy may have a synergistic effect on treatment outcomes. The study aims to investigate the benefit of LDRT in combination with conventionally fractionated radiotherapy (CFRT) in improving the outcome of metastatic ESCC concurrently treated with first-line immunochemotherapy. The recruited patients will be randomly (1:1) assigned to receive either PD-1 inhibitor plus chemotherapy (paclitaxel and platinum regimen) (arm B) or in combination with LDRT and CFRT (arm A). The primary endpoint is median progression-free survival (PFS).
