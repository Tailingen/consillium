A Study of RC118 in Patients With Locally Advanced Unresectable/Metastatic Solid Tumours
This is a Phase 1, First-in-Human, Multicentre, Open-label Study of RC118 for Injection in Patients with Locally Advanced Unresectable/Metastatic Solid Tumours to determine the safety and tolerability of RC118, including the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/maximum administered dose (MAD), and to define the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D).
Unresectable Solid Tumor|Metastatic Solid Tumor|Locally Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: RC118 for injection
MTD/MAD based on number of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), The maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/maximum administered dose (MAD) will be assessed based on the number of patients experiencing DLTs, graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) v5.0. If the MTD cannot be reached in this study, the MAD will be recorded., Up to 18 months|Determine Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D), The RP2D may be selected based on the MTD/MAD following consultation with the safety monitoring committee with all available data., Up to 18 months|Adverse Events, The adverse events occurring or worsening on or after the first dose of the study drug will be recorded., Up to 18 months
Object Response Rate (ORR), ORR will be determined according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) v1.1. The ORR is defined as the number of patients are either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), relative to the number of patients belonging to the study of interest., Up to 18 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of first administration to the date of the first documentation of progressive disease or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 18 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is the proportion of patients with disease control., Up to 18 months|Duration of response (DOR), DOR is defined, for patients with response, as the time from first documentation of response (CR or PR) to the date of first documentation of progression of disease or death due to any causes whichever occurs first., Up to 18 months|Immunogenicity, Incidence of anti-drug antibody (ADA) against RC118, Up to 18 months|Maximum Plasma Concentration [Cmax], Cmax of total antibodies, RC118 and free MMAE, Up to 18 months|Area under the plasma concentration [AUC], AUC of total antibodies, RC118 and free MMAE, Up to 18 months|Tmax, Peak time (Tmax) of total antibodies, RC118 and free MMAE, Up to 18 months
CLDN18.2 expression, The expression of CLDN18.2 will be scored semi-quantitatively, based on staining intensity and the percentage of staining in provided archived/biopsy tumor samples, Up to 18 months
This is an open-label, Phase 1, FIH, study consisting of dose-escalation (Part A) and dose confirmation (Part B) in Australia. This trial is to evaluate the safety, tolerability (MTD/MAD), PK, immunogenicity of RC118, and further determine the RP2D. In addition, the preliminary anti-tumour efficacy of RC118 as single agent will be assessed.
