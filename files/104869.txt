Ultrasound Elastography in Imaging Patients With Thyroid Nodules
This clinical trial studies how well ultrasound elastography works in assessing the cancer status of potentially malignant thyroid nodules.
Malignant Thyroid Gland Neoplasm|Thyroid Gland Nodule
DEVICE: Siemens Acuson S3000 ultrasound system
Stiffness of Thyroid Nodules as Measured by Elastography, Potentially cancerous thyroid nodules will be assessed elastographically, and cancer status will be determined from a fine needle aspiration biopsy results or the surgically excised nodule. The outcome will be reported as median tissue stiffness with standard deviation for nodules that were determined non-cancerous (benign), cancerous, or indeterminate., 1 week
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

Determine the utility of ultrasound elastography in evaluation of thyroid nodules being evaluated for the presence of cancer.

Elastography measures the passages of ultrasound shear waves through tissue to gauge the stiffness and compressibility of the tissue, collectively "tissue stiffness," and may be a better way to image thyroid nodules. Tissue stiffness is a physiological parameter that is being evaluated for differences between non-cancerous (benign) and cancerous thyroid nodules.

Participants will undergo elastography over the 10 minutes prior to either fine needle aspiration of a biopsy specimen or surgical resection of the thyroid nodule. Tissue specimens from the biopsy specimen or surgical resection will be assessed pathologically to determine actual cancer status.
