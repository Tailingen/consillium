A Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability, PK/PD and Preliminary Efficacy of HBM4003 Combined With Anti-PD-1 Antibody
This is an open-label, multi-center phase 1 study. The trial, consisting of Part 1a dose confirmation and Part 1b dose expansion, is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK/PD and preliminary efficacy of HBM4003 in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced NSCLC and other solid tumors.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: HBM4003 and pembrolizumab
Part 1a: Number of subjects with DLT in each dose group within 1 cycles (21 days) after the first drug administration, DLT observation period was defined as one treatment cycles with a total of 21 days, approximate 21 days|Part 1b: ORR, Proportion of subjects with complete response (CR) and partial response (PR), maximum 2 years
Part 1a: ORR, including proportions of subjects with complete response (CR) and partial response (PR), maximum 2 years|Part 1a: Disease Control Rate, DCR, including proportion of subjects with complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD), maximum 2 years|Part 1a: Duration of Response, DOR, Calculate the duration from the first confirmed CR or PR to the date of disease progression or death (for any reason), maximum 2 years|Part 1a: Duration of Disease Control, DDC, For subjects with Cr, PR or SD, the duration from the time of initial administration to the date of disease progression or death (for any reason) was calculated, maximum 2 years|Cmax, Peak Plasma Concentration, maximum 2 years|Tmax, Time to reach maximum serum concentration, maximum 2 years|AUC0-last, Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time zero to last, maximum 2 years|AUC0-tau, Area under the serum concentration versus time curve from time zero to the dosing interval tau, maximum 2 years|UC0-inf, Area under the serum concentration versus time curve from time zero to infinity, maximum 2 years|Vss, Volume of distribution at steady state, maximum 2 years|CL, Clearance, maximum 2 years|t1/2, Terminal half-life, maximum 2 years|Part 1a: Immunogenicity of HBM4003 and pembrolizumab, including the occurrence of positive anti-drug antibodies (ADA). The occurrence of neutralizing antibodies for subjects with positive ADA, maximum 2 years|Part 1b: Number of subjects experiencing at least one treatment-related AE, Evaluate safety, maximum 2 years|Part 1b: DCR, including proportion of subjects with CR, PR and SD, maximum 2 years|Part 1b: DOR, calculate the duration from the first confirmed CR or PR to the date of disease progression or (for any reason) death., maximum 2 years|Part 1b: DDC, for subjects with CR, PR or SD, calculate the duration from the time of initial medication to the day of disease progression or (for any reason) death, maximum 2 years|Part 1b: Overall survival (OS), the length of time from the start of treatment to the death of the subject (for any reason), maximum 2 years|Part 1b: Progression-free survival (PFS), the length of time from the beginning of treatment to the beginning of disease progression or death (for any reason), maximum 2 years|Part 1b: Immunogenicity of HBM4003 and pembrolizumab, including the occurrence of positive anti-drug antibodies (ADA). The occurrence of neutralizing antibodies for subjects with positive ADA., maximum 2 years
subjects will be treated with HBM4003 in combination with pembrolizumab for up to 2 years or until confirmed disease progression, unacceptable tolerability or treatment discontinuation through withdrawal of consent occurs, whichever happens first.
