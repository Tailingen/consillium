SCAP vs HIFU for Recurrent Prostate Cancer After Radiation Therapy
The evidence base relating to the use of SCAP and HIFU is poor, with significant uncertainties relating to long-term oncological outcomes. One of the main limitations when the few studies reported are analyzed is the lack of information about the histopathology both before starting treatment and at the time of recurrence after cryotherapy. The vast majority of studies refer only to BCR-free survival as end point, thus limiting interpretation of real oncological performance of this technique. Furthermore, side effects vary widely from study to study and there are uncertainties about the real morbidity associated to cryotherapy in the salvage setting.

Another important hot issue in this scenario is the potential benefit that new imaging and diagnosis techniques (MRI, targeted biopsy, PSMA) may add for a more accurate indication. This could provide the possibility of better results for SCAP. The clinical value of this new diagnostic tools is unknown in this scenario and needs to be explored.
