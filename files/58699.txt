Assessment of Safety and Efficacy of ThisCART19A in Adult Patients With B Cell Malignancies After Failure of Autologous Chimeric Antigen Receptor T- Cell(CAR-T) Therapy
This is a a phase 1, open label study to assess the safety and efficacy of ThisCART19 (Allogeneic CAR-T targeting CD19) in adult patients with B cell malignancies after failure of autologous chimeric antigen receptor T- cell(CAR-T) therapy in china.
Allogeneic, CAR-T, Protein Sequestration, Non-gene Edited
DRUG: ThisCART19A|DRUG: Fludarabine Pill|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: VP-16 Protocol
Dose limited toxicity(DLT) observation in patient with B Cell Malignancy in each dose level during dose escalation stage, DLT is defined as the incidence of severe adverse events related to ThisCART19A more than 33% in each dose level., 28 days|Objective Response Rate within 3 months during dose expansion stage, For Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), Objective response rate(ORR) is the percentage of patients who achieve Complete Response (CR) or Complete Response With Incomplete Hematologic Recovery (CRi); for lymphoma, ORR is the incidence of either a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR)., 3 months|Minimum Residual Disease (MRD) Negative Remission Rate within 3 months during dose expansion stage, MRD was assessed utilizing multicolor flow cytometry to detect residual cancerous cells with a sensitivity of 10\^-4. MRD negative remission was defined as MRD \< 10\^-4 threshold. Percentage of participants with MRD negative remission was reported., 3 months
Duration of response(DOR) during dose escalation stage and expansion stage, DOR was defined as the time from first CR/CRi or PR to relapse or any death in the absence of documented relapse., 24 months|Relapse-free Survival (RFS), RFS is defined as the time from the date of ThisCART19A infusion to the date of disease relapse or death from any cause., 24 months|Event-free Survival (EFS), EFS is defined as the time from the date of ThisCART19A infusion to the date of disease relapse, progression, genetic relapse or death from any cause., 24 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of ThisCART19A infusion to the date of death from any cause., 24 months
This is a phase 1, single-center, nonrandomized, open-label, dose-escalation and dose expansion study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ThisCART19A in adult patients with B cell malignancies after failure of autologous chimeric antigen receptor T- cell(CAR-T) therapy and identify a treatment regimen most likely to result in clinical efficacy while maintaining a favorable safety profile.
