Safety and Efficacy of BA1302 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a first-in-human (FIH), multicenter, open-label Phase I study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK profile, immunogenicity, and preliminary efficacy of BA1302 in patients with advanced solid malignancies. The study includes a dose-escalation phase (Part A) and a dose-expansion phase (Part B).
