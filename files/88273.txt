A Clinical Study to Evaluate the Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of TQB3617 Capsule in Patients With Advanced Malignant Tumors
TQB3617 is a bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) inhibitor that can competitively bind to bromodomains (BRDs) with Acetylated lysine(Kac) and block or partially block the role of KAc in subsequent gene transcription and regulation of chromatin structure, thereby playing an anti-tumor role.
