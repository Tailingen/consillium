Patient-Reported Erectile Recovery and Quality of Life Outcomes With Lyopreserved Placental Tissue Applied Directly Over Neurovascular Bundle During Nerve Sparing Radical Prostatectomy Versus Standard of Care
Surgical implantation of Lyopreserved Placental Tissue (LPT) is FDA approved and has been used extensively in wound care. The use is expanding and more recently, LPT has been used in the management of diabetic foot ulcers, acute and chronic surgical wounds, various fistulas and even as a nerve wrap on the common peroneal nerve. Surgical technique for nerve-sparing prostatectomy has evolved continuously since first described by Walsh in 1982 and is now commonly performed with robotic assistance.

The investigators intend to study whether placement of LPT over the spared neurovascular bundle during nerve-sparing robotic prostatectomy will improve return to potency and/or continence after robotic radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer. Patients with a preoperative Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) score \> 19 (moderate or high pre-op sexual function) planning to undergo robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy will be randomized to receive direct placement of LPT over the preserved neurovascular bundles vs standard of care. Patients will independently report erectile function and continence at 1 months, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year after surgery. Primary outcomes would include mean time to achieve potency, percentage of group achieving potency at each time point, and mean change in SHIM score. Secondary outcomes would include mean time to achieve continence. The investigators will also report any adverse events.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Stravix lyopreserved placental tissue (LPT)|PROCEDURE: Radical prostatectomy
Change in erectile function as assessed by the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) Score, The primary outcome variable is the patient's score on the IIEF questionnaire (erectile function domain) at 1,3, 6, 9, 12, and 18 months post-surgery. A comparison of changes in the initial IIEF score will be evaluated to determine treatment efficacy. The IIEF contains 15 questions. A score of 0-5 is awarded to each of the 15 questions that examine the 4 main domains of male sexual function: erectile function, orgasmic function, sexual desire, and intercourse satisfaction. Overall scores will be categorized as follows:

* 1-10: Severe Erectile Dysfunction
* 11-16: Moderate dysfunction.
* 17-21: Mild to moderate dysfunction
* 22-25: Mild dysfunction
* 26-30: No dysfunction, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 18 months post-surgery
Change in erectile function and overall quality of life as assessed by the Expanded Prostate cancer Index Composite (EPIC) score from questionnaires, The following questionnaires will be combined into a composite index EPIC score. EPIC scoring involves linear standardization of the response for each questionnaire to a 0 to 100 scale. Using the item groupings for each health-related quality of life (HRQOL) Domain Summary Score or Subscale score, values are averaged for all items within a group to create the summary or subscale score. A higher score represents better HRQOL. EPIC scores will be compared at each time point. A clinically relevant increase for the sexual domain is 10-12 points.

* The Quality of Erection Questionnaire (QEQ) assesses erection in terms of hardness, onset, duration, and changes in erection quality. There are 6 questions.
* The Short Form Survey (SF-12) assesses 8 health domains: Physical Functioning, Role-Physical, Bodily Pain, etc with 1-2 questions per domain.
* The MUSIC questionnaire assesses four domains: urinary, bowel, sexual and hormonal. Each domain consists of 2-4 questions., 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 18 months post-surgery
