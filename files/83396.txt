Cardiotoxicities in Patients Receiving BTKi
This is a multicenter, prospective, observational cohort study to comprehensively and longitudinally evaluate and characterizes the cardiovascular events with CLL patients who are initiating treatment with a Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib or acalabrutinib.

Incidence of atrial arrhythmias, Any documented evidence of atrial arrhythmia including symptomatic and asymptomatic events captured by EKG, 28-day mini cardiac telemetry, or monitoring of cardiac rhythm during echocardiogram or cardiac MRI., During 6 months of BTK inhibitor therapy
Incidence of ventricular arrhythmias, Assessed by 28-day mobile telemetry, During 6 months of BTK inhibitor therapy|Severity of ventricular arrythmia, NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0, During 6 months of BTK inhibitor therapy
This research study includes three visits for research blood, physical exam, and cardiac testing at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. The study will collect the following data during the 6-month study period:

* Blood sample collection
* Electrocardiogram (ECG)
* Echocardiogram
* Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
* Mobile cardiac telemetry
* Blood pressure measurement
