Expression of MCM5 in Urine in Patients With Urothelial Cancers
In patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, the development and introduction to the clinical practice of an adequately accurate biomarker may allow to limit the indications for performing control cystoscopy. Thus, it will reduce the discomfort and stress of patients, the risk of complications of the invasive procedure and probably significantly reduce the costs incurred by healthcare systems.

The aim of the present study is to determine the usefulness of the determination of MCM5 protein expression in the urine of patients with urinary bladder or upper urinary tract cancer.
Bladder Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Assessment of expression of MCM5 in the urine (ADX Bladder)
Expression of MCM-5 in the urine, Expression of MCM-5 will be determined in urine sediment by Arquer Diagnostics ADXBLADDER test (ELISA test using two monoclonal antibodies directed against epitopes of high affinity and specificity for the MCM5 antigen)., Within 48 hours after subject enrollment
