Coaches Activating Reaching and Engaging Patients
The purpose of the Team Based Advance Care Planning CAREPLAN program is to understand if a trained lay navigator who engages with patients with advanced stages of cancer can help patients in advance care planning, improve patient activation, satisfaction, quality of life, and the quality of end of life cancer care while also ensuring goal concordant cancer care at the end of life.

Stanford Cancer Institute plans to implement and evaluate several critical elements to be in alignment with the mission of the organization to provide high value care to their patients. The CAREPLAN (Coaches Activating, Reaching, and Engaging Patients in Their End of Life Care Plan) intervention is an innovative program aimed to strengthen provider-patient relationships and facilitate whole person care about matters important to patients diagnosed with advanced stages of cancer and important to patients' support network and family. The project is intended to help establish patients' Goals of Care Plan with appropriate documentation, develop, deploy, and evaluate a model of care for patients with cancer that is intended to improve clinical outcomes and their experiences with their cancer care. The intervention provides patients with lay navigators who assist them and their families in formulating and discussing their goals of care with their health care teams in hopes to engage in shared-decision making for goal concordant care. The goal of the project is to demonstrate that there is improved documentation of goals of care, patient experiences, patient activation, quality of life, and quality of care and communication and that the program helps to improve goal concordant care receipt at the end of life.
