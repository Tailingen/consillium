A Phase II Study of 131I- Metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) for Treatment of Metastatic or Unresectable Pheochromocytoma and Related Tumors
This is an ongoing prospective Phase II clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of 131I-MIBG for the treatment of patients with metastatic or unresectable pheochromocytoma and related tumors.
Pheochromocytoma|Paraganglioma
RADIATION: 131I-MIBG
Number of Patients With Complete (CR), Partial (PR), or Minor (MR) Response and Without Progressive Disease, Patients with complete (CR), partial (PR), or minor (MR) response and without progressive disease 1 year from initial treatment, using RECIST RESPONSE CRITERIA for measurable soft tissue tumor: CR=No Tumor (Primary or metastatic); catacholamines, metanephrines and chromogranin A all normal. PR=Primary and all measurable sites decreased \>50%; number of positive bone sites decreased by \>50%; bone marrow tumor decreased by 50%. MR=No new lesions; \>50% reduction of any measurable lesion (primary or metastases); \<25% increase in any existing lesion., After 1 year from initial treatment
1. To assess the efficacy of high-dose 131I-MIBG in the treatment of patients with malignant pheochromocytoma and related tumors, with the basis of this initial examination being the percentage of patients in CR or PR, and the percentage of patients without PD for 3 years after the initial administration on 131I-MIBG therapy.
2. To describe the response rate of malignant pheochromocytoma patients treated with high-dose 131I-MIBG.
3. To describe the toxicity of high-dose 131I-MIBG in patients with malignant pheochromocytoma.
4. To describe the overall survival and failure-free survival of malignant pheochromocytoma patients treated with high-dose 131I-MIBG.
5. To determine the utility of using the serum level of Chromogranin A as a tumor marker for patients with malignant pheochromocytoma.
