Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy alone has showed much benefit for low/ intermediate risk stage II/III rectal cancer which would be verified by the PROSPECT trial. However, the effect of the Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was heterogeneous in different patients. It's important to verify those chemo-resistant cases as early as possible. So that, this trial will compare the pathological effect between 2 cycles and 4 cycles of Capox regimen as neoadjuvant chemotherapy for low/ intermediate risk stage II/III rectal cancer to explore whether those chemotherapeutic non-responders after 2 cycles Capox was non-inferior to those after 4 cycles chemotherapy.
