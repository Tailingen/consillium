Study of B013 and Nab-Paclitaxel for Locally Advanced or Metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer
This Phase II/III study assessed the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of B013 administered with nab-paclitaxel in participants with locally advanced or metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) who have not received prior systemic therapy for metastatic breast cancer (mBC).
Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC)
DRUG: B013+Nab-Paclitaxel
Objective response rate (ORR)(phase Ⅱ), tumor response will be evaluated according to the Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria version 1.1., Baseline up to approximately 18 months|Progression-free survival (PFS)(IRC) (phase Ⅲ), from the start date of study treatment to the date of progression disease or death , whichever occurred first., Baseline up to approximately 18 months
Disease control rate (DCR), DCR was defined as the percentage of patients who have achieved complete response, partial response and stable disease, 18 months|Duration of remission (DOR), DOR was defined for participants who had an objective response as the time from the first occurrence of a documented unconfirmed response (CR or PR) to the date of disease progression per RECIST v1.1 or death from any cause, 18 months|Time to Response (TTR), Defined as the interval from the start of study therapy to the first documentation of an objective response, 18 months|Overall Survival (OS), Determination of the overall survival times of all patients, 3years|Drug concentration in plasma, Determination of drug concentration in plasma of all patients, 18 months|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, Adverse event type, incidence, duration, correlation with study drug, 3years
