Robot-assisted vs VATS for Thymoma
The aim of this study is to explore the advantages of robot-assisted thymectomy in long-term survival benefits and short-term clinical efficacy compared with video-assisted thoracoscopic thymectomy based on a multi-center, prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial.

PROCEDURE: RATS for Thymectomy|PROCEDURE: VATS for Thymectomy
5-year overall survival (OS), OS at 5 year after surgery, 5 year after surgery
Pain score, Pain was assessed using a pain scale on the first day, 1 month, 6 months and 1 year after surgery. Pain was evaluated using the visual analogue scale (VAS) and the numerical rating scale (NRS), with higher scores indicating greater pain, at 1 year after surgery|quality of life (QOL) at 1 year by EORTC QLQ-C30, Quality of life was assessed at 1 month, 6 months and 1 year after surgery. QQL was evaluated using the European Organization for the Treatment and Research of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) version 3.0, at 1 year after surgery|quality of life (QOL) at 1 year by EQ-5D, Quality of life was assessed at 1 month, 6 months and 1 year after surgery. QQL was evaluated using the European Five Dimensional Health Scale (EQ-5D)., at 1 year after surgery|R0 rate, R0 radical rate, postoperative in-hospital stay up to 30 days|operative time, the time of operation, Intraoperative|blood loss, blood loss in the operation, Intraoperative|conversion rate, the rate of conversion to open surgery in the operation, Intraoperative|length of hospital stay (LOS), length of stay in hospitalization, postoperative in-hospital stay up to 30 days|Catheterization days, The interval days from the completion of catheter insertion to the removal of the thoracic tube, postoperative in-hospital stay up to 30 days|Volume of drainage, Volume of drainage from the completion of catheter insertion to the removal of the thoracic tube, postoperative in-hospital stay up to 30 days|postoperative complications, mainly include: pneumonia, arrhythmia, incision infection, vocal cord paralysis, trachea cannula, postoperative in-hospital stay up to 30 days|30-day mortality, 30-day mortality after surgery, postoperative in-hospital stay up to 30 days|30-day readmission rate after surgery, Rate of readmission due to postoperative complications, postoperative in-hospital stay up to 30 days|5-year disease-free survival (DFS), DFS at 5 year after surgery, 5 year after surgery|Tumor recurrence rate, The rate of recurrence of thymoma in patients after surgery, 5 year after surgery
Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery ( VATS ) is widely used in thoracic surgery and has gradually replaced traditional thoracotomy in thymoma. As a new type of VATS, the long-term oncological results of robot-assisted thoracoscopic surgery in thymoma have not been verified. Therefore, we designed a multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial to determine whether RATS thymectomy is as effective as VATS thymectomy in terms of short-term and long-term outcomes.
