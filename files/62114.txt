Sexual behavior/repertoire (kissing, intercourse, etc.) graded using the Sexual Experiences Scale (SES), Multilevel modeling will be used to model time effects compared to repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) because it allows not only fitting different patterns of average change (i.e., linear, quadratic), but also estimates individual variability in the rate of change. Both linear and quadratic change models will be tested and an optimal model will be determined. 95% confidence intervals will be obtained., Up to 2 months|Sexual responsiveness (desire, arousal, orgasm) using the Female Sexual Functioning Index (FSFI), Principal components analysis yields six subscales: desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain. Items are rated using the Likert scales. 95% confidence intervals will be obtained., Up to 4 weeks|Sexual satisfaction graded using the global evaluation from the Derogatis Sexual Function Inventory (DSFI), 95% confidence intervals will be obtained., Up to 2 months|Sexual distress graded using the female Sexual Distress Scale (FSDS), The Likert scale will be used. 95% confidence intervals will be obtained., Up to 4 weeks|Sexual pain graded using the International Pelvic Pain Society Pelvic Pain Assessment, patient/physician version, Up to 9 months
Emotional distress graded using the Profile of Mood States (POMS), The Likert scale will be used. 95% confidence intervals will be obtained., Up to 9 months|Depressive symptoms graded using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), The Likert scale will be used. 95% confidence intervals will be obtained., Up to 9 months|Health-related quality of life graded according to the RAND Medical Outcomes Study, Short-form 12 (SF-12), The eight primary subscales are summarized into two component scores: the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS)., Up to 9 months|Cancer-related stress graded according to the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R), Up to 9 months|Body change stress graded according to the Impact of Treatment Scale (ITS), Up to 9 months
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Efficacy for reducing the severity of sexual distress, difficulty, and dysfunction in a phase II randomized clinical trial (RCT).

OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

ARM I (Enhanced standard care): Patients participate in enhanced standard care intervention comprising stress reduction, information delivery regarding gynecologic or breast cancer treatments and sexuality, and provision of a survivorship care plan (SCP) created using OncoLink over 1 hour following baseline assessment and before 6 months.

ARM II (Psychological intervention): Patients participate in individual or group therapy over 1.5 hours weekly for 4 weeks, bi-weekly for 8 weeks, and monthly for 2 months and complete assessment interviews.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3, 6, and 9 months.
