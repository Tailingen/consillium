Genotyping 2 SNPs in Chinese Breast Cancers
The purpose of this study is to determine the frequency of two Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) by sanger-sequencing in Breast Cancers and healthy controls .
rs185670819 and rs183489969
GENETIC: rs183489969,rs185670819
Genotyping of 2 SNPs ( rs185670819 and rs183489969) in Chinese breast cancer patients and age-matched healthy control women ., January of 2019
Both of the 2 SNPs' minor allele frequency or affected ratio shows statistically significant differences between case and control groups, June of 2019
Since the 1990s breast cancers incidence of china has increased more than twice as fast as global rates. Chinese patients are responsible for 12.2% of all newly diagnosed breast cancers and 9.6% of all deaths to world breast cancers. Breast cancer is now the second frequently diagnosed cancer and is the leading cause of cancer-related death in Chinese women.

Two of the most prevalent breast cancer susceptibility genes are BRCA1and BRCA2. Howeverï¼Œbecause of population based Genetic heterogeneity, the frequency of BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation is not as high in Caucasian population as in China. Anyway, the mean age at diagnosis of breast cancer in China is almost 10 years younger and more cases are diagnosed before 40 than those in Caucasians. Therefore, it is believed that there are certain specific susceptibility loci in Chinese breast cancers.

In preliminary experiments, investigators found two germline mutations may associate with Chinese breast cancers.

The purpose of the study is to determine the frequency of two germline mutations by sanger-sequencing in a larger sample of Chinese breast cancers
