Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging (MRS) and Tumor Perfusion of Human Glioblastoma Treated With Concurrent Radiation Therapy and Temozolomide
The purpose of this study is to learn whether 3 tesla (3T) MRI functional imaging will map a tumor more accurately allowing a more targeted delivery of radiation. The investigators hope to learn whether tomotherapy will be able to deliver higher radiation doses safely to the tumor while sparing the surrounding normal tissue.
