Study With Paclitaxel +/- Ramucirumab in Patients With Squamous-cell Carcinoma of the Esophagus After Prior Therapy
This is a multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label phase II study including patients with squamous-cell carcinoma of the esophagus, refractory or intolerant to combination therapy with Fluoropyrimidine and Platinum-based drugs.

This is a phase II, randomized, open-label multi-center study comparing treatment of paclitaxel plus ramucirumab with paclitaxel monotherapy in patients with advanced squamous-cell carcinoma (SCC) of the esophagus.

Adult patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced squamous-cell carcinoma of the esophagus and refractory or intolerant to combination therapy with Fluoropyrimidine and Platinum-based drugs will be enrolled in the study.

A total number of 186 patients will be enrolled (Randomization 1:1). 93 patients will be treated with paclitaxel + ramucirumab (Arm A) and 93 with paclitaxel (Arm B).

Randomization will be stratified by time of progression during or after end of first-line therapy (â‰¤3 months vs. \>3 months).

The primary objective is to compare overall survival (OS) after 6 months in patients with squamous-cell carcinoma of the esophagus, refractory or intolerant to combination therapy with Fluoropyrimidine and Platinum-based drugs receiving paclitaxel with ramucirumab versus paclitaxel alone in the intent-to-treat population (ITT). OS is defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause.

Patients in Arm A (investigational arm) receive Paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 on day 1, 8, 15 plus Ramucirumab 8 mg/kg i.v. infusion on day 1 and 15 every 4 weeks. Patients in Arm B (control arm) receive Paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 on day 1, 8, 15 every 4 weeks. Study treatment will be continued until progression or intolerable toxicity, but for a maximum of 1 year.

Tumor assessment will be performed according to clinical routine at screening / baseline and every 8 weeks.

After discontinuation of study medication, patients will be followed for up to 1 year. Tumor assessments per CT or MRI will be performed every 2 months for 6 months or until documentation of disease progression. Follow-up for survival will be done and documented every 2 months for the 1 year follow-up period after end of treatment.

During treatment, clinical visits (blood cell counts, detection of toxicity) will be performed prior to every treatment dose. Safety of paclitaxel +/- ramucirumab will be monitored continuously by careful monitoring of all adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) reported. Prior to the start of each cycle and at the 30-day safety follow-up visit Quality of life (QoL) will be assessed using the European Organization for Research and treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 (EORTC-QLQ-C30).
