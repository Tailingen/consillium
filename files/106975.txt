A Phase Ib/II Clinical Study of Camrelizumab and Apatinib Plus GP in the Treatment of Advanced Biliary Tract Cancer
The objective of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of camrelizumab combined with apatinib and chemotherapies (gemcitabine and cisplatin) in patients with advanced biliary tract cancer (BTC).
Locally Advanced Biliary Tract Cancer|Metastatic Biliary Tract Cancer
DRUG: Camrelizumab and Apatinib Plus GP
Incidence of dose-limiting toxicity, Dose limiting toxicities will determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of combination therapy with camrelizumab + apatinib and gemcitabine plus cisplatin. Assessed using the NCI CTCAE v5.0, up to day 22|Recommended phase 2 dose(RP2D) of apatinib, To determine a RP2D of apatinib for each population of biliary tract carcinoma subjects., 12 weeks|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Defined as percentage of participants achieving assessed complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) by the investigator according to the RECIST 1.1., up to 24 months
Adverse Events (AE), overall incidence of adverse events (AE); incidence of grade 3 or higher AE; incidence of severe adverse events (SAE); incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation of drug use; incidence of AEs leading to suspension of drug use., up to 24 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR was defined as the percentage of participants who have a confirmed complete response（CR） or partial response（PR） or stable disease（SD） per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by investigator, up to 24 months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from enrollment to the first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Responses are according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as assessed by investigator, up to 24 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS is the time from enrollment to death due to any cause., up to 24 months
The study consists of 2 parts, a dose-escalation part (Phase 1) and an expansion part (Phase 2). Both parts will enroll participants with advanced unresectable biliary tract cancer that had not previously treated with systemic therapy.
