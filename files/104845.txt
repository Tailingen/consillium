Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined based on the incidence, intensity, and duration of AEs for which no clear alternative cause is identified. The DLT period will be 28 days (4 weeks) in the Preliminary Safety Cohorts. Any toxicities that occur beyond the 4-week DLT period will also be considered in dose-level decisions. For the purpose of participant management, any AE that meets DLT criteria, regardless of the cycle in which it occurs, will lead to discontinuation of study treatment. AEs will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03., From first dose up to 100 days post last dose, up to approximately 31 months|The Number of Participants Experiencing Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation, An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation participant administered study treatment and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment., From first dose up to 100 days post last dose, up to approximately 31 months|The Number of Participants Experiencing Adverse Events Resulting in Death, An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation participant administered study treatment and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment., From first dose up to 100 days post last dose, up to approximately 31 months|The Number of Participants Experiencing Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities, The number of participants experiencing abnormal laboratory results of Grade 3 or higher.
