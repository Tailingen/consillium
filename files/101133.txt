Risk-adapted Screening in First-degree Relatives of Patients With Colorectal Cancer
BACKGROUND: First-degree relatives of patients with colorectal cancer are at increased risk for colorectal cancer as well. Nevertheless, participation in the German national screening program stagnates at 2-3 percent per year even in this high-risk population.

AIM: The study is aimed to increase the portion of the first-degree relatives on 50% which take up a preventive colonoscopy.

METHODS: Cluster-randomized controlled multi-center trial. Study sites (clusters) are mainly certified cancer centers and office-based gastroenterologists from all over Germany. Index-patients with colorectal cancer of different stages are asked to hand over the study material to their relatives, consisting of an invitation to a nurse-led counseling on preventive colonoscopy and an one-to-one appointment with a clinical expert of one of the study sites next.
Colorectal Neoplasms
BEHAVIORAL: Nurse-led counselling
utilization of preventive colonoscopy, utilization within 30 days after enrolement
Rate of advanced adenomas or carcinomas in situ, Rate within 6 month after enrolement|post-operative complications associated with the colonoscopy, within 30 days after enrolement|barriers to the use of preventive colonoscopy, Barriers against preventive colonoscopy are very common among the healthy population. Such barriers can bei either of cognitive (e.g. being afraid of the potential diagnosis) or emotional nature (e.g. shame to be exposed naked to the examiners).

Barriers are assessed by Barriers Questionnaire-II (BQ-II) during telephone counselling., within 30 day after enrolement, additional at 6 months after enrolement|effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of nurse-led counselling, within 30 days after enrolement|time delay between signed informed consent and utilization of colonoscopy, at utilization of the colonoscopy
