A Phase 2 Pilot Study of Apixaban for the Prevention of Thromboembolic Events in Patients With Advanced (Metastatic) Cancer
The purpose of this study is to learn whether apixaban is well-tolerated and acceptable as anticoagulant therapy, when administered to patients with advanced or metastatic cancer and at increased risk for venous thromboembolic events. Demonstration of a favorable benefit:risk profile could lead to significant reduction in this serious and sometimes fatal complication of ongoing cancer and its treatment.

DRUG: Apixaban|DRUG: Placebo
Number of Participants With Composite of Confirmed Major Bleeding and Clinically Relevant Nonmajor (CRNM) Bleeding, Major bleeding was defined as clinically overt bleeding accompanied by 1 or more of the following:

* A decrease in hemoglobin of 20 g/L or more or
* Required transfusion of 2 or more units of packed red blood cells or whole blood, or
