A Study Evaluating the Safety and Pharmacology of Atezolizumab Administered in Combination With Immunomodulatory Agents in Participants With Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
This is a non-randomized, open-label, Phase Ib study of atezolizumab in combination with immunomodulatory agents for the treatment of participants with AML (relapsed/refractory and treatment-naive, elderly participants unfit for induction chemotherapy). The study has been designed with the intent, over time, to study multiple combinations of atezolizumab with different immunomodulatory agents in participants with AML. The study will begin with the evaluation of the combination of atezolizumab and guadecitabine (Arm A). In the future, additional arms may be added.
