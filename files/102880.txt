A Tear-based, Lab-developed Test for Breast Cancer for Women With Dense Breast Tissue
Investigation of a tear-based, lab-developed biological test for breast cancer, as a supplemental tool to current screening recommendations for women with dense breast tissue will explore if a tear-based biological test can be used as a support tool in the breast cancer screening protocol for women with dense breast tissue. The test was designed and validated by Namida Lab, Inc., a high complexity Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified lab.
