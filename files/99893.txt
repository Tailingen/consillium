N2 Lung Cancer Project: Neoadjuvant Treatment Followed Surgery Versus Chemoradiation
The objective of this multicenter retrospective study is to compare overall survival in patients with stage IIIA-N2 NSCLC treated with neoadjuvant treatment and surgery versus definitive chemoradiation.

Secondary objectives are to analyze disease-free survival, median survival, locoregional and distant relapses as well as mortality and toxicity related to treatment.

Based on data published by the Intergroup 0139 trial, induction therapy followed by surgery in patients with stage IIIA-N2 NSCLC can increase overall survival compared to exclusive radical chemoradiation treatment.

The major handicap of all studies addressing the role of surgery in IIIA-N2 NSCLC is the difficulty of recruiting patients. Therefore, multicenter studies are necessary to confirm the hypothesis generated by the INT 0139.
