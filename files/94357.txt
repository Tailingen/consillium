Study of Vaginal Dilator Use After Pelvic Radiotherapy
Patient will have radiation to treat the cancer. This treatment can make the vagina both narrower and shorter. That can cause two problems. It can make it harder for the doctor to do a pelvic exam during a follow-up visits. And, it can make sexual intercourse uncomfortable.

We tell women to use a vaginal dilator after radiation to the pelvis. This is standard education. We do not routinely ask women how they do with it. We are doing this study to see if using the dilator as we instruct will help the vagina stretch. The patient will have an examine of the vagina before the start of radiation. We will see what size dilator can fit. The goal of this study is to have the patient be able to use that size dilator within six months after radiation.
