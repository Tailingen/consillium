Maximal Use Systemic Exposure (MUSE) Study of Levulan Kerastick
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential for systemic exposure of aminolevulinic acid (ALA) when applied topically under occlusion, in a maximal use setting in patients with multiple actinic keratoses (AK) involving the upper extremities.
