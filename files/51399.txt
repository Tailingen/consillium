Myeloma Novel Drug Discovery Ver 1.2
Myeloma is a bone marrow cancer with over 5000 patients diagnosed in the UK each year. Researchers are committed to improving understanding of myeloma and developing more effective treatments with fewer side effects in order to improve patient outcomes. In order to do this, researchers are collecting samples of blood and bone marrow to test the activity of potential new treatments in the laboratory and to understand what may be the cause of some treatments not working.
