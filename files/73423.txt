Phase III Study of ABI-007(Albumin-bound Paclitaxel) Plus Gemcitabine Versus Gemcitabine in Metastatic Adenocarcinoma of the Pancreas
Phase III Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: Albumin-bound paclitaxel (ABI-007)|DRUG: Gemcitabine
Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from all causes. Participants who did not die were censored at the last known time the participant was alive. Patient survival was summarized using Kaplan-Meier methods., From randomization to death; until the data cut off 17 Sept 2012. The maximum time in follow up was 37 months.
Progression-free Survival (PFS) by Independent Radiological Review (IRR), Progression-free survival was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of disease progression, or death (any cause) on or prior to the clinical cutoff date, whichever occurred earlier. Participants who did not have disease progression or had not died were censored at the date of the last tumor assessment, on or prior to the clinical cutoff, and the patient was progression free. If a patient began a new anti-cancer treatment prior to documented disease progression (or death), the patient was censored at the date of last assessment when the patient was documented as progression free prior to the intervention. Patients with two or more consecutive missing response assessments prior to a visit with documented progression (or death) were censored at the last date of tumor assessment when the patient was documented to be progression free. PFS was summarized using Kaplan-Meier methods., Randomization until disease progression or death from any cause; Until the data cut off of 17 Sept 2012. The maximum time in follow up was 37 months.|Percentage of Participants Who Achieved an Objective Confirmed Overall Response by Independent Radiological Review (IRR), Objective tumor response was summarized as the percentage of participants who achieved a confirmed complete (CR) or partial response (PR) based on an independent blinded radiology assessment of response using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines. Using RECIST Version 1.0, participants were to achieve either a complete response (CR) defined as the disappearance of all known disease and no new sites or disease related symptoms confirmed at least 4 weeks after initial documentation or partial response (PR) defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions and no progression in non-target lesions based on confirmed responses from the investigator assessment of best overall response during study treatment., Assessment every 4 weeks after initial response; Day 1 to data cut off of 17 Sept 2013; maximum time on study 37 months
Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (AE), A Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE) is as any AE occurring or worsening on or after the first treatment of any study drug, and within 30 days after the last dose of the last study drug. Severity grades according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 (CTCAE) on a 1-5 scale: Grade 1= Mild AE, Grade 2= Moderate AE, Grade 3= Severe AE, Grade 4= Life-threatening or disabling AE, Grade 5=Death related to AE., Study drug initiation through 30 days after the last dose of study drug or EOS, whichever is later; Up to 696 days|Number of Participants With Dose Reductions, The number of participants with dose reductions occurring during the treatment period. Dose reductions are typically caused by clinically significant laboratory abnormalities and /or treatment emergent adverse events/toxicities., Maximum time on treatment was 666 days|Number of Participants With Dose Interruptions, The number of participants with dose interruptions experienced by participants that occurred during the treatment period. Dose interruptions are typically caused by clinically significant laboratory abnormalities and /or treatment emergent adverse events/toxicities., Maximum time on treatment was 666 days|Number of Participants With Dose Delays/Doses Not Given, The number of dose delays or doses not given experienced by participants during the treatment period. Dose delays are typically caused by clinically significant laboratory abnormalities and /or treatment emergent adverse events/toxicities. Treatment delays of no longer than 21 days allowed participants to recover from acute toxicity, otherwise participants were discontinued from further treatment except in the event of peripheral neuropathy., Up to 666 days
A Phase III, open-label randomized, multicenter trial to compare ABI-007(Albumin-bound Paclitaxel)in combination with gemcitabine administered weekly to standard treatment (gemcitabine monotherapy) with respect to overall survival, objective tumor response rate and Progression Free Survival (PFS) in patients diagnosed with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.
