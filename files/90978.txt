PROstaTe Cancer - Exercise-STudy (PRO-TEST)
Background and purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of exercise on intratumoral natural killer (NK)-cell variability in patients with localized prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy.

The primary hypothesis is that exercise induces epinephrine-mediated intratumoral natural killer (NK)-cell infiltration in patients with localized prostate cancer, and that the infiltration is greater in patients performing High Intensity Interval Training compared to usual care controls.

Currently there is a lack of randomized controlled trials examining different types of exercise in patients with localized prostate cancer. Moreover there is a need for studies including biological measurements to allow a full assessment of the effect of exercise on diverse biomarkers and mechanistic pathways, which may influence cancer survival.

Subjects: Patients with histologically verified prostate adenocarcinoma scheduled for radical prostatectomy at Urologic Department, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.

Methods: In this randomized controlled pilot study 30 patients with localized prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy will be included and randomized 2:1 to either High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) exercise intervention or observational control receiving usual care from inclusion and until planned surgery (radical prostatectomy).

All patients will undergo assessments at inclusion (baseline) and at follow-up after the exercise intervention period (maximum 8 weeks) 3-5 days prior to surgery.

Assessments include: anthropometrics; blood pressure; resting hearth rate; cardiorespiratory fitness by cardiopulmonary exercise test (VO2 peak.); body composition by DXA scan; quality of life by self-report questionnaires; fasting blood sample measuring cholesterol, triglycerides, insulin, c-peptide, HbA1c, glucose, hormones and inflammatory markers.

Biological tissue from tumor (primary prostate biopsies) will be retrieved from the respective local pathological departments and from the perioperative prostate specimen and sent to protocol analyses.

Resting heart rate and blood pressure (Microlife, BPA100) will be determined in a supine position. Body composition (fat mass, bone mass and fat-free mass) and bone mineral density are analyzed by whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan (Lunar, Lunar Corporation Madison, Wisconsin, USA). Transverse scans at 1 cm intervals are made from head to toe measuring the absorption of x-ray beams at two different energy levels as these are sent through the body. Since the different chemical compounds in the body absorb the intensity of the X-rays differently, the scan allows for a valid determination of bone mass, fat mass and fat-free/bone-free mass, Baseline and up to 8 weeks|Change in VO2peak, The participants will undergo a maximal graded exercise test on a bicycle ergometer for evaluation of cardiovascular function and determination of the peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak).

Ventilation and expired gases will be measured during the test via an indirect calorimetric system, and heart rate will be assessed simultaneously., Baseline and up to 8 weeks|Change in wattmax, The participants will undergo a maximal graded exercise test on a bicycle ergometer for evaluation of cardiovascular function and determination of the maximum watt (wattmax).

The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of exercise on the variability of intratumoral Natural Killer (NK)-cell infiltration in tumor biopsies taken before and after an exercise intervention in patients randomized 2:1 to one of two study arms: I) High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) (N=20) or II) usual care, prior to radical prostatectomy.

In addition to this the investigators wish to investigate the effect of HIIT exercise on the infiltration of other immune cells into the tumor, tumor vessel morphology, modulation of tumor-metabolism, -biology and signaling.

Finally the aim is to explore the effect of pre-operative HIIT exercise on physiological (e.g. cardiovascular fitness, body composition, metabolic profile and metabolic inflammatory markers) and psycho-social (e.g. fatigue, emotional well-being, anxiety) endpoints relative to usual care.
