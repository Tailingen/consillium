Intensified Chemo-immuno-radiotherapy With Durvalumab for Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancers
This is a phase II study that will assess if Durvalumab (MEDI4736) used as induction chemo-immunotherapy followed by concurrent chemo-immuno-radiotherapy and consolidation immunotherapy may improve oncologic outcomes compared with standard of care chemoradiation followed by durvalumab (as in the PACIFIC trial) with a reasonable safety profile.
Lung Neoplasms
DRUG: Durvalumab
12 months Progression-Free Survival, Proportion of patients who are alive and progression-free 12 months after cycle 1, day 1 of induction treatment, estimated by the Kaplan-Maier method and using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1., Tumor scans will be performed at baseline, after the induction and concomitant phases and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the last dose of radiation therapy.
Overall Survival (OS), Time from cycle 1, day 1 of induction treatment until death due to any cause., OS will be evaluated until month 24 after C1D1.|Overall response rate to induction treatment, The proportion of patients with at least one tumor scan of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) using RECIST v1.1., Tumor scans will be performed at baseline, after the induction and concomitant phases and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the last dose of radiation therapy.|Patterns of Failure, Rate of disease failure in local, regional and distant sites, Tumor scans will be performed at baseline, after the induction and concomitant phases and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the last dose of radiation therapy.
Prospective, non-randomized, open label, single arm, multi-institutional, phase 2 study, including patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer able to receive concurrent chemoradiation. Eligible patients will then receive treatment as follows:

Induction chemo-immunotherapy Two 21-day cycles of carboplatin, paclitaxel and durvalumab will be given BEFORE concurrent chemo-immuno-radiotherapy.

Thereafter, patients without progressive disease (or patients with disease progression that is still locally advanced and can be safely encompassed within tolerable radiation fields) will receive concurrent chemo-immuno-radiotherapy, as follows:

Concurrent chemo-immuno-radiotherapy Concurrent carboplatin, paclitaxel, and durvalumab with radiation therapy, initiated preferably 3-5 weeks after the last dose of induction chemo-immunotherapy.

Thereafter, patients without progressive disease will receive consolidation immunotherapy, as follows:

Consolidation immunotherapy Twelve 28-day cycles of durvalumab will be given, initiated preferably within one week following concurrent chemo-immuno-radiotherapy.
