JSKN003 in Platinum-Resistant, Relapsed Epithelial Ovarian Cancer
This study is a randomized, open-label, controlled, phase III study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of JSKN003 versus investigator's choice of chemotherapy in patients with platinum-resistant, relapsed epithelial Ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.
