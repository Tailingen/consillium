Glasdegib (PF-04449913) With Temozolomide Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma
Glioblastomas (GBMs) are the most common malignant primary brain tumors. Despite multimodality aggressive therapies (surgery followed by chemoradiotherapy based on TMZ and adjuvant TMZ), median overall survival is only 12 to 15 months. This dramatic behavior is mainly due to the high invasiveness and proliferation rate of GBM.

In addition, GBM exhibits a high resistance to standard chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Current strategies for the treatment of GBM are only palliative, and include surgical resection (which is frequently incomplete due to the proximity of the tumour to vital brain structures) and focal radiotherapy. A large number of chemotherapeutic agents (e.g. alkylating agents such as TMZ and nitrosoureas such as carmustine) have also been tested, but they display limited efficacy.

The current gold standard first line treatment for glioma for patients less than 70 years old includes radiation and concurrent TMZ followed by adjuvant TMZ (i.e., the "Stupp regimen"). However, results are disappointing and there is an unmet medical need of new drugs in this setting.

Glasdegib (SHH pathway inhibitor) is a rational therapeutic agent for patients with newly diagnosed Glioblastoma since inhibits SHH pathway interfering with cancer stem cells and endothelial migration.
