Optimizing GVHD Prophylaxis After Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation
This study will compare post-transplant health-related quality of life following the use of standard versus attenuated dose of post-transplant cyclophosphamide in addition to two-drug graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis among recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant.
Hematological Malignancies|Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD)
DRUG: Attenuated-dose Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: High-dose Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Sirolimus|DRUG: Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF)
Change in Health-Related Quality of Life as Measured by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Bone Marrow Transplantation, The health-related quality of life will be assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Bone Marrow Transplantation (FACT-BMT) trial outcome index (TOI). The FACT-BMT is a validated, patient-reported questionnaire that measures physical and functional well-being specifically in bone marrow transplant recipients. Higher scores indicate better quality of life. The primary outcome is to compare the FACT-BMT TOI scores between the attenuated-dose PTCy arm and the high-dose PTCy arm at 3 months post-transplant., Baseline and 3 months post-transplant
Change in Karnofsky Performance Scale, Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) is a validated tool ranging from 0 (death) to 100 (normal activity). Higher scores indicate better functional status., Baseline and 3 months post-transplant|Change in Activities of Daily Living, Activities of Daily Living (ADL) measures basic self-care tasks such as bathing and dressing. The typical total score ranges from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating better functional status., Baseline and 3 months post-transplant|Change in Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, Change in Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) assesses more complex tasks (e.g., handling finances). Total scores typically range from 0 to 8 or 0 to 14 (depending on the version), with higher scores indicating greater independence., Baseline and 3 months post-transplant|Change in Fried Frailty Index, The Fried Frailty Index assesses five components (weight loss, exhaustion, grip strength, walking speed, and physical activity). A higher total score indicates greater frailty., Baseline and 3 months post-transplant|Change in Clock-in-the-Box Test, This is a brief test of visuospatial and executive function, typically scored on accuracy of clock drawing/placement (range 0-8). Higher scores suggest better cognitive performance., Baseline and 3 months post-transplant|Change in History of Falls, The number of falls, if any, will be collected since baseline. Results will be analyzed as the proportion of participants experiencing ≥1 fall over the time frame, or as the difference in mean (or median) number of falls between arms., Baseline and 3 months post-transplant|Change in Body Mass Index, Body Mass Index (BMI) is calculated as weight (kg) / \[height (m)\]² (kg/m²). Higher or lower values do not necessarily indicate "better" or "worse" status by themselves but will be compared between arms for changes from baseline., Baseline and 3 months post-transplant|Change in Geriatric Depression Scale-15, The Geriatric Depression Scale-15 (GDS-15) is a 15-item screening tool for depression in older adults (scores 0-15). Higher scores indicate more severe depression., Baseline and 3 months post-transplant|Gaft-Versus-Host Disease-Free, Relapse-Free Survival, Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GRFS) is defined as the time from transplant to the first occurrence of grade III-IV acute GVHD, chronic GVHD requiring systemic immune suppression, disease relapse or progression, or death from any cause. An event is counted when any of these conditions are met. The GRFS at 1 year post-transplant will be compared between the two treatment arms., From date of transplant to 1 year post-transplant|Overall Survival at 1 Year Post-Transplant and Event-Free Survival, Overall Survival (OS) is defined as survival from the date of transplant until death from any cause. Event-Free Survival (EFS) is defined as survival from the date of transplant without disease relapse or progression. The study will compare the proportion of participants alive (for OS) and without relapse or progression (for EFS) at 1 year post-transplant between the two treatment arms, From date of transplant to 1 year post-transplant|Cumulative Incidence of Transplant-Related Mortality, Transplant-related mortality (TRM) is defined as death from causes other than disease relapse or progression. The study will estimate and compare the cumulative incidence of TRM at 1 year post-transplant between the two treatment arms., From date of transplant to 1 year post-transplant|Cumulative Incidence of Grade II-IV Acute GVHD, Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of grade II-IV is assessed using the Mount Sinai acute GVHD grading system. The study will estimate and compare the cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD at 1 year post-transplant between the two treatment arms., From date of transplant to 1 year post-transplant|Cumulative Incidence of Chronic GVHD, Chronic GVHD is assessed using the NIH chronic GVHD grading system, which includes both classical chronic GVHD and overlap syndrome. The study will estimate and compare the cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD at 1 year post-transplant between the two treatment arms., From date of transplant to 1 year post-transplant|To determine the cumulative incidence and kinetics of hematologic recovery (neutrophil and platelet) among the two treatment arms, Hematologic recovery is evaluated by time to neutrophil engraftment (absolute neutrophil count ≥ 500/mm³ for three consecutive days) and platelet engraftment (platelet count ≥ 20,000/mm³ or ≥ 50,000/mm³ without transfusion for seven days). The study will describe and compare the cumulative incidence and kinetics of neutrophil and platelet recovery by days +28 and +100 post-transplant between the two treatment arms., From date of transplant to day +28 and day +100 post-transplant|Incidence of Grade III or Higher Adverse Events, Adverse events will be graded using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. The study will assess and compare the incidence of grade III or higher adverse events by day +100 post-transplant between the two treatment arms., From date of transplant to day +100 post-transplant|Cumulative Incidence of Grade II or Higher Infections, Infections will be graded according to Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN) criteria. The study will estimate and compare the cumulative incidence of grade II or higher infections by 6 months post-transplant between the two treatment arms., From date of transplant to 6 months post-transplant
This is a single-center phase II study of 126 participants (63 per arm) with hematological malignancies. Participants will be randomized to receive high doses (standard arm) or attenuated doses of cyclophosphamide in addition to two-drug GVHD prophylaxis. Participants will be monitored for health-related quality of life \[Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Bone Marrow Transplant, FACT-BMT(1)\], functional outcomes (Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS), activities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily living, Clock-in-the-Box Test, Fried Frailty Index, fall history, BMI, and Geriatric Depression Scale-15, GVHD, relapse, survival, and toxicities (using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, CTCAE version 5.0).
