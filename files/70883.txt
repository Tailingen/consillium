Based on the ELN 2013 definition: Molecular response used breakpoint cluster region/Abelson (BCR-ABL1) transcript measured by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-Q-PCR). Evaluation was expressed as percentage of ratio of BCR-ABL1 transcripts to ABL1 transcripts according to the international scale (IS) or the ratio of BCR/ABL1 transcripts to other internationally recognized control transcripts levels. MR4.0 was defined and recorded as detectable disease with \<0.01% BCR-ABL1 transcripts on IS or undetectable disease in cDNA with greater than (\>) 10,000 ABL1 transcripts in the same volume of cDNA used to test for BCR-ABL1 transcripts., Baseline up to 5.5 years|Percentage of Participants With Cumulative Complete Molecular Response 4.5 (MR4.5), Molecular response used blood sample of the participants to evaluate response to treatment for CML. Based on the ELN 2013 definition: Molecular response used breakpoint cluster region/Abelson (BCR-ABL1) transcript measured by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-Q-PCR). Evaluation was expressed as percentage of ratio of BCR-ABL1 transcripts to ABL1 transcripts according to the international scale (IS) or the ratio of BCR/ABL1 transcripts to other internationally recognized control transcripts levels. MR4.5 was defined and recorded as detectable disease with \<0.0032% BCR-ABL1 transcripts on IS or undetectable disease in cDNA with \>32,000 ABL1 transcripts in the same volume of cDNA used to test for BCR-ABL1 transcripts., Baseline up to 5.5 years|Percentage of Participants With Cumulative Major Molecular Response (MMR)/Molecular Response 3.0 (MR3.0), Molecular response used blood sample of the participants to evaluate response to treatment for CML. Based on the ELN 2013 definition: Molecular response used breakpoint cluster region/Abelson (BCR-ABL1) transcript measured by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-Q-PCR). Evaluation was expressed as percentage of ratio of BCR-ABL1 transcripts to ABL1 transcripts according to the international scale (IS) or the ratio of BCR/ABL1 transcripts to other internationally recognized control transcripts levels. MMR was defined as a BCR-ABL1 to ABL1 less than or equal to (\<=) 0.1% on the IS., Baseline up to 5.5 years
Percentage of Participants With Treatment Related Adverse Events (AEs), Treatment-related AE was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to Bosutinib in a participant who received Bosutinib. Relatedness to Bosutinib was assessed by the investigator., Baseline up to 5.5 years|Percentage of Participants With Treatment Related Adverse Events (AEs) Greater Than or Equal to Grade 3, Treatment-related AE was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to Bosutinib in a participant who received Bosutinib. AE was assessed according to maximum severity grading based on National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0. Grade 1 =mild; Grade 2 =moderate; within normal limits, Grade 3 =severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; Grade 4 =life-threatening or disabling; urgent intervention indicated; Grade 5 =death., Baseline up to 5.5 years|Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the duration between initiation of Bosutinib therapy and date of progression estimated by the treating physician or death of participant (all causes combined). Progression was defined as change from chronic phase of CML (CP-CML) to accelerated phase of CML (AP-CML) or to blast crisis of CML (BC-CML). CP-CML is frequently asymptomatic and diagnosed with \<10% blasts. Based on the ELN 2013 definition: AP-CML was defined by the presence of blast cells between 15-29% or blast cells plus promyelocytes \>30%, with blasts \<30% in blood or bone marrow, platelet count \<100\*10\^9 or clonal chromosome abnormalities in Ph+ cells. BC-CML was defined as blasts in blood or bone marrow \>=30%, extramedullary blast proliferation (excluding spleen), large foci or clusters of blasts in bone marrow biopsy. Participants who were alive at the date of last assessment were censored on the date of data collection., Year 1, 2, 3|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the duration from initiation of Bosutinib therapy to date of death (all causes combined). For participants who were alive or lost to follow-up (LTFU), overall survival was censored on the date of data collection or date LTFU, respectively., From baseline up to 1 Year, baseline up to Year 2, baseline up to Year 3|Percentage of Participants With Disease Progression, Progression was defined as change from CP-CML to AP-CML or to BC-CML. CP-CML is frequently asymptomatic and diagnosed with \<10% blasts. Based on the ELN 2013 definition: AP-CML was defined by the presence of blast cells between 15-29% or blast cells plus promyelocytes \>30%, with blasts \<30% in blood or bone marrow, platelet count \<100\*10\^9 or clonal chromosome abnormalities in Ph+ cells. BC-CML was defined as blasts in blood or bone marrow \>=30%, extramedullary blast proliferation (excluding spleen), large foci or clusters of blasts in bone marrow biopsy., Year 1, 2, 3|Percentage of Participants With Permanent Discontinuation From Bosutinib Therapy, Baseline up to 5.5 years|Cross-Intolerance Between Bosutinib and Previous Therapy, Cross-intolerance was defined as percentage of participants who permanently discontinued bosutinib due to an adverse event which also resulted in discontinuation of a previous treatment (imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib)., Baseline up to 5.5 years|Mean Dose of Bosutinib at Initiation of Treatment, Baseline up to 5.5 years|Relative Bosutinib Dose Intensity, Relative dose intensity was defined as the percentage of daily dose received over the expected daily dose of the study drug., Baseline up to 5.5 years|Duration of Bosutinib Therapy, The duration from initiation of Bosutinib therapy up to the end of Bosutinib therapy was reported in this outcome measure., Baseline up to 5.5 years
