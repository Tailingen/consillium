Organoid Model Predictive of Response to Immunotherapies
The purpose of this study is to create models out of tissue samples and treat those models with the same immunotherapy treatment the patient will be receiving, in order to validate this process and to predict responses to therapies and use it to choose the best treatments for people in the future. The researchers will then examine the direct effects of the treatment on those models.

Calculate overall patient response rate, Compare patient response using RECIST 1.1 criteria and immune-organoid response based on the following criteria:

1. Complete response \<50% of viable tumor cells
2. Response \>50%\<70% of viable tumor cells
3. Stable \>70%\<90% viable tumor cell left
4. Progressive \>90% of viable tumor cell left, Baseline to 12 months|Reliability of organoid development, calculate the percentage of biopsies with successful organoid development, Baseline to 2 months
