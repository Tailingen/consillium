Comparing Minimally Invasive Treatments for Pilonidal Disease: LA POPA Trial (Laser And Pit-picking OR Pit-picking Alone)
The goal of this randomized clinical trial is to establish the efficacy of 'pit picking with laser therapy' versus 'pit picking alone' on both short and long-term outcomes in patients of 12 years and older with primary pilonidal sinus disease.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

* The overall success rate of treatment which is defined as: closure of all pits at 12 months of follow-up.
* Secondary endpoints: succes rat eof treatment during long-term follow-up, wound closure time, pain scores, complication rate, work rehabilitation, time to return to daily activities, quality of life, persisting complaints, patient satisfaction, costs and the need for secondary or revision surgery.

Participants will allocated to pit picking alone or combined with lasertherapy.

The extra burden for participating patients is expected to be minimal to moderate. Participants will have two extra hospital visits in casethey are enrolled in our study: 6 and 12 months after enrolment. Postoperatively the normal scheme of follow up appointments wil be used: 2 and 6 weeks after treatment at the outpatient clinic of the treating surgeon. A telephone appointment with the researcher will be scheduled 4 weeks after treatment. Patients are asked to complete questionnaires at various time points, which will be sentto them by email and will take approximately 5-10 minutes each time. The content includes general and disease specific Quality of Life (QoL) questionnaires. The investigators do not expect any extra adverse reactions or events in respect to participation in the study because both procedures are considered standard of care in the participating clinics. However, because both interventions are surgical procedures a small percentage of adverse events or postoperative complications can be expected.

PROCEDURE: Pit-picking surgery|PROCEDURE: Pit-picking surgery with Sinus Laser assisted Closure
Succes rate of treatment, Success rate of treatment, defined as closure of all pits at 1 year follow-up. Closure of the pits will be assessed by the treating surgeon by means of an extensive physical examination., 1 year
Success rate of treatment at long-term follow-up, Success rate of treatment at 3 and 5 years follow up, 3-5 years|Pain score, Pain scores in the period after surgery (VAS). VAS score scale: 0-10, higher score meaning a worse outcome., 6 weeks|Patient reported outcome measures, PROMs, defined as persisting complaints: itching, wound fluid leakage, blood loss, pus, pain, social burden (shame/embarrassment). PROMs will be scored on a scale: 1-5, with a higher score meaning a worse outcome., 5 years|Wound healing and complications, Wound and complications, 1 year|Work rehabilation, Work rehabilitation; number of days, 6 weeks|Return to daily activities, Time until return to daily activities; number of days, 6 weeks|Recurrence rate, Recurrence rate at 1, 3 and 5 years of follow-up, 5 years|Need for secondary or revision surgery, Need for seondary or revision surgery for pilonidal disease, 5 years|Patient satisfaction, Patient satisfaction with treatment (scored on a likert scale 0-10, with a higher score meaning a better outcome), 5 years|Quality adjusted life years (QALYs), Quality of life after treatment (Eq-5d-5l; will be converted to Quality adjusted life years (QALYs; range 0-1, with 1 the highest score and the better outcome), 5 years|Absence of symptoms, Absence of symptoms at 1-yars follow-up: participants will be asked a dichotomous question during their 1-year follow-up appointment. At that moment, do they feel their symptoms from pilonidal sinus disease are: A) cured or improved when compared with before treatment? or B) unchanged or worse when compared with before treatment?, 1 year
