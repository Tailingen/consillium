Everolimus and Bevacizumab in Advanced Non-Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)
The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad the combination of two medications, everolimus and bevacizumab, has on kidney cancer. In this clinical trial we are now testing these medications in combination. We think that both together might work better that either drug alone. Importantly, both of these drugs together have been tested in patients with a different type of kidney cancer and patients tolerated the combination well.
