A Trial on Clinical Efficacy of 1% Versus 2% Lignocaine in Cough Suppression and Pain Relief in Patients Undergoing Flexible Bronchoscopy
Flexible bronchoscopy is a common procedure performed by pulmonary physicians. The use of topical anesthesia, analgesia, and sedation during flexible bronchoscopy varies among physicians, institutions and geographic locations across the globe. Commonly used topical anesthetic agents before and during bronchoscopy include cocaine (4%),benzocaine (20%), tetracaine (1%), and lignocaine (1%-10%). Topical lignocaine is administered through the flexible bronchoscope in an attempt to reduce excessive coughing and patient discomfort. However, the optimal dosage and strength of topical lignocaine that should be used during fibreoptic bronchoscopy has long been a topic of controversy. In this study we compare the efficacy of 1% versus 2% lignocaine in controlling cough and pain in patients undergoing flexible bronchoscopy.
