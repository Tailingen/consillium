A Study of Camrelizumab Combined With Chemotherapy as Neoadjuvant Therapy in Adcanced Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (ESCC)
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of camrelizumab combined with albumin paclitaxel and platinum chemotherapy in the preoperative treatment of locally advanced thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Camrelizumab, Albumin Paclitaxel, Carboplatin
Objective remission rate (ORR), evaluated by researchers based on the RECIST 1.1 standard, through study completion, an average of 2 year|progression free survival (PFS), evaluated by researchers based on the RECIST 1.1 standard, through study completion, an average of 2 year|overall survival (OS), evaluated by researchers based on the RECIST 1.1 standard, through study completion, an average of 2 year|Disease control rate(DCR), evaluated by researchers based on the RECIST 1.1 standard, through study completion, an average of 2 year|pathologic complete response (pCR), evaluated by researchers based on the RECIST 1.1 standard, through study completion, an average of 2 year
Primary outcome:

1. Analysis of prognosis efficacy of patients: pathologic complete response (pCR)

Secondary outcome:

Overall survival(OS), Progressive-free survival(PFS), Disease control rate(DCR), Objective response rate(ORR), and the proportion of subjects who completed all treatments and radical resection (R0);

Explorative outcome:

To explore the efficacy of ultrasound gastroscopy, PET/CT, peripheral circulating blood tumor cell (CTC) detection and CTC-based immunofluorescence detection of PD-L1 antibody for the treatment of locally advanced ESCC with camrelizumab combined with albumin paclitaxel and platinum and potential biomarkers for predicting the efficacy of camrelizumab, including but not limited to immunohistochemical detection of PD-L1 expression in tumor specimens, T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing analysis in peripheral blood, and esophageal microbiome Analysis, etc.; patients' quality of life
