Laser Therapy of Benign Thyroid Nodules
Nodular goitre is common in the general population and less than 5% of the patients who undergo surgery for solitary thyroid nodules have cancer, in absence of clinical suspicion. Nodules left untreated seem to have a slight growth potential in borderline iodine-deficient areas. Interstitial laser photo-coagulation (ILP) is a procedure for local hyperthermia and photocoagulation, allowing minimally invasive treatment of benign tumors, including thyroid nodules. The aim of these studies are to evaluate if ILP will be useful in reducing the volume of the benign thyroid nodule and thyroid function will be unaffected in euthyroid patients, and normalized in pretoxic- and toxic thyroid nodules. The investigations are listed below:

1. Randomized study of interstitial laser photocoagulation for benign solitary cold thyroid nodules - one versus two or three treatments
2. Randomized study of interstitial laser photocoagulation for benign solitary autonomous thyroid nodules - 131I versus laser ablation
3. Interstitial laser photocoagulation for benign thyroid cystadenomas. - a feasibility study.
Benign Solitary Solid|Cystic Thyroid Nodules
PROCEDURE: Interstitial laser photocoagulation
To evaluate the efficacy and feasibility repeated ILP treatments in a prospective randomised study where the nodule and thyroid volume are measured 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after the ILP.|In the study of patients with a cystadenoma the measures will be done like wise, but also the recurrence of the cystic part will be measured.|Patients with an autonomous functioning nodule measurements of thyroid function are performed 1,2, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after the ILP or 131I therapy.
