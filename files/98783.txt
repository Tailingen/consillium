Ablation in Combination With Lenvatinib and Anti-PD-1 Antibodies
Lenvatinib is an oral multi-target receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) inhibitor that mainly inhibits the Endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) VEGFR-1,2,3; Fibroblast growth factor receptor, FGFR) FGFR-1,2,3,4; Platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) PDGFRα; The kinases RET and KIT, thereby inhibiting tumor cell proliferation, inducing apoptosis, and playing an anti-angiogenic role, have been approved by the FDA and CFDA as first-line treatment for patients with advanced liver cancer. lenvatinib showed longer disease progression than sorafenib (8.9 months vs. sorafenib. 3.7 months), longer progression-free survival (7.4 months vs. 3.7 months), and higher disease control rates (24.1% vs. 9.2%). Therefore, lenvatinib has obvious advantages in HCC treatment because of its strong anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor growth effects.

Cindilimab is a human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to PD-1 molecules on the surface of T cells, thereby blocking the programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1)/programmed death receptor-1 ligand (PD-L1) pathway induced by tumor immune tolerance, and reactivating the antitumor activity of lymphocytes.

In summary, recurrence after radical treatment of liver cancer is an urgent clinical problem. Recurrent HCC treatment represented by resection, ablation and TACE is difficult to achieve more satisfactory efficacy. The main ablative techniques includes radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation and cryoablation.As a local treatment for liver cancer, ablation has the risk of incomplete ablation and insufficient ablation margin, and because RFA cannot resolve micrometastases, tumor growth, invasion and metastasis occur. Therefore, ablation combined with lenvatinib and immune checkpoint inhibitors have theoretical complementary advantages, and this study intends to compare the clinical efficacy and safety of ablation combined with lenvatinib plus anti-PD-1 antibodies in the treatment of patients with early recurrent liver cancer compared with ablation alone.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: lenvatinib + anti-PD-1 antibodies|PROCEDURE: ablation
Recurrence-free Survival, RFS, Defined as the percentage of patients who had achieved 1 year of disease recurrence (i.e., intrahepatic recurrence or extrahepatic metastasis) or death (from any cause) from the date of enrollment, whichever occurred first., 1 year
Recurrence free survival (RFS) at 2 years, Defined as the percentage of patients with no disease recurrence (i.e., intrahepatic recurrence or extrahepatic metastasis) or death (from any cause) for 2 years from the date of enrollment., 2 years|Recurrence free survival (RFS) at 3 years, Defined as the percentage of patients with no disease recurrence (i.e., intrahepatic recurrence or extrahepatic metastasis) or death (from any cause) for 3 years from the date of enrollment., 3 years|Safety: Incidence of adverse events, Incidence of adverse events, severe AES, death, and laboratory abnormalities in treated patients., 18 months|Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS): defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause throughout the trial.
