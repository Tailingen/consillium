Margetuximab Plus Chemotherapy vs Trastuzumab Plus Chemotherapy in the Treatment of HER2+ Metastatic Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine whether patients with metastatic breast cancer treated with margetuximab plus chemotherapy have longer progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) than patients treated with trastuzumab plus chemotherapy.

A non-randomized sub-study cohort of approximately 88 patients will be enrolled to evaluate the safety of a reduced margetuximab infusion rate in patients receiving margetuximab either as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy.
HER-2 Positive Breast Cancer|Metastatic Neoplasm
BIOLOGICAL: Margetuximab|BIOLOGICAL: Trastuzumab|DRUG: Physician's choice of chemotherapy.
Progression-free Survival (PFS) as Determined by Independent Radiological Review., PFS is measured from the time of randomization until first documented disease progression or death from any cause, whichever is first., Tumor assessments are conducted every 6 weeks for the first 24 weeks and then every 24 weeks until progression of cancer, average 5 months.|Overall Survival (OS) Defined as the Number of Days From Randomization to the Date of Death (From Any Cause)., Overall survival is the time from randomization until death from any cause, Throughout the study, average 21 months|Number of Patients With Grade 3 or Higher Infusion Related Reactions, Incidence of Grade 3 or higher infusion-related reactions for patients receiving 60-minute or 30-minute infusions of margetuximab in Cycle 2 of treatment, 22 days
To Evaluate Progression-free Survival (PFS), as Assessed by Study Investigators., Tumor assessments are conducted every 6 weeks for the first 24 weeks and then every 24 weeks until progression of cancer, up to 6.5 years.|To Evaluate the Objective Response Rate (ORR) as Determined by Independent Radiological Review., Objective response rate includes all patients with either a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR) to study treatment, Tumor assessments are conducted every 6 weeks for the first 24 weeks and then every 24 weeks until progression of cancer, up to 6.5 years.|Infusion Rate Sub-study All Safety, Incidence of all grades of infusion-related reactions, Throughout the study, average duration 6 months
