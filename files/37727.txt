A Study of Ruxolitinib in Pancreatic Cancer Patients
This was to determine the efficacy, based upon overall survival, of ruxolitinib added to capecitabine for the treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer.
Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: Ruxolitinib|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Capecitabine
Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival is reported here based on the number of deaths from randomization until the data cut-off., Randomization until death due to any cause up to 6-months or to the data cutoff 11FEB2016.
Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from randomization until the earliest date of disease progression determined by investigator assessment of objective radiographic disease assessments per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, or death due to any cause if sooner. Progressive Disease (PD) is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions, unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, or the appearance of new lesions., Randomization to disease progression, or death due to any cause if sooner; up to 6-months or to the data cutoff 11FEB2016.|Percentage of Participants Achieving Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from randomization until the earliest date of disease progression determined by investigator assessment of objective radiographic disease assessments per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, or death due to any cause if sooner. Progressive Disease (PD) is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions, unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, or the appearance of new lesions., Randomization to disease progression, or death due to any cause if sooner; up to 6-months or to the data cutoff 11FEB2016.|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective response rate determined by radiographic disease assessments per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours RECIST (v1.1), by investigator assessment and was defined as the percentage of participants with Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) by RECIST at any post baseline visit. Per RECIST for target lesions and assessed by computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions with no worsening of non-target lesions and no new lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., Baseline through end of study; up to 6-months or to the data cutoff 11FEB2016.|Duration of Response, Duration of overall response was defined as the time in months from Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST v1.1) until the first date Progressive Disease (PD) was objectively documented or until the date of death. Per RECIST for target lesions and assessed by computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions with no worsening of non-target lesions and no new lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., Baseline through end of study; up to 6-months or to the data cutoff 11FEB2016.|Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), A treatment-emergent AE was defined as an event occurring after exposure to at least 1 dose of study drug (ruxolitinib or placebo). A treatment-related AE was defined as an event with a definite, probable, or possible causality to study medication. A serious AE is an event resulting in death, hospitalization, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or is life threatening, a congenital anomaly/birth defect or requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes above. The intensity of an AE was graded according to the National Cancer Institute common terminology criteria for adverse events (NCI-CTCAE) version 4.03: Grade 1 (Mild); Grade 2 (Moderate); Grade 3 (Severe); Grade 4 (life-threatening)., Baseline through approximately 30 days post treatment discontinuation; up to 6-months or to the data cutoff 11FEB2016.
This was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 study, in which approximately 270 participants with advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas who had failed or were intolerant to first-line chemotherapy were to be randomized (1:1) to one of the following treatment groups:

* Treatment A (N = 135): Capecitabine + ruxolitinib
* Treatment B (N = 135): Capecitabine + placebo

Treatment consisted of repeating 21-day cycles. Capecitabine was self-administered for the first 14 days of each cycle, and ruxolitinib/placebo was self-administered during the entire cycle. Treatment for all participants was to continue as long as the regimen was tolerated, and the participant did not meet discontinuation criteria. Participants who discontinued treatment continued to be followed for subsequent anticancer treatments and survival.
