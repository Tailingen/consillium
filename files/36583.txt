18F-FAPI PET Imaging in Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
To explore the potential efficacy of 18F-FAPI-04 PET/CT for PDAC tumour staging and compare the results with those obtained using 18F-FDG PET/CT.

Accurate diagnosis and staging are crucial for selecting treatment for patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The desmoplastic responses associated with PDAC are often characterised by hypometabolism. Here we investigated 18F-fibroblast activation protein inhibitor (18F-FAPI-04) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in evaluation of PDAC, and compared the findings with those obtained using (18F)-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG).
