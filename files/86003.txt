ASPET Study: An Observational Study of Tarceva (Erlotinib) in First Line in Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Harbouring EGFR Activating Mutations
This observational study will evaluate the patterns of disease progression in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harbouring EGFR activating mutations receiving Tarceva (erlotinib) as first-line treatment. Patients will be followed for up to 12 months after progression of disease.
