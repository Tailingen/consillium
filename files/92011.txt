JSKN003 Versus Treatment Of Physician'S Choice For HER2-low, Unresectable and/or Metastatic Breast Cancer Subjects
This study is a randomized controlled, open-label, multicenter phase III clinical study evaluating the efficacy and safety of chemotherapy selected by investigator JSKN003 s in subjects with recurrent or metastatic breast cancer who have previously failed first- or second-line chemotherapy in subjects with recurrent or metastatic breast cancer who have failed prior first- or second-line chemotherapy.

The study planned to enroll 400 subjects in a 1:1 ratio and stratified block randomization method assigned to:

* Experimental group: JSKN003 monotherapy
* Control group: investigator's chosen chemotherapy drug (capecitabine, gemcitabine, vinorelbine, docetaxel, albumin-bound paclitaxel, or eribulin) monotherapy

Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS evaluated by BICR according to RECIST v1.1 criteria is defined as the time from randomization to the first recorded disease progression or death from any cause as a result of BICR evaluation according to RECIST v1.1 criteria., 16 months 、26 months after the first enrollment
Overall survival（OS）, OS, defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause;, 16 months 、26months 、60 months after the first enrollment|Objective Response Rate (ORR), BICR and investigators were judged according to RECIST v1.1 criteria ，objective response rate (ORR), defined as the proportion of participants achieving a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST v1.1 criteria;, 16 months 、26 months after the first enrollment|Duration of Response (DOR), BICR and investigators were judged according to RECIST v1.1 criteria，Duration of response (DoR), defined as the time from the first recorded response (CR/PR) to the first documented disease progression (PD) or death from any cause;, 16 months 、26 months after the first enrollment
