FAZA PET IMAGING IN DETECTING LYMPH NODE METASTASES IN RENAL CELL CARCINOMA PATIENTS
In renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients, lymph node metastases detection and treatment are the most critical issues in daily clinical decision-making. Indeed, conversely to other oncological settings, a) nodal status imaging, b) sentinel node technique and c) standard lymphadenectomy have been demonstrated inadequate in the staging and management of RCC patients. A novel, accurate, standardized imaging technique is urgently needed in RCC setting to detect macro and micro nodal invasion, to identify those patients who are at higher risk of having nodal metastases, to accurately plan the best management. Recent studies suggested combining 18F-FAZA PET with CT scanning in the detection of cancer-induced hypoxia.The investigators propose to test 18F-FAZA PET-CT in detecting nodal metastases to improve the management of RCC patients.
