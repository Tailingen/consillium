LIBRARY is a prospective, multi-center, observational study aimed at detecting early liver, biliary tract, and pancreatic cancers by combining assays of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) methylation, serum protein, and microRNA. The study will enroll approximately 458 participants diagnosed with liver, biliary tract, and pancreatic cancers, 330 individuals with corresponding benign diseases and 820 healthy participants.
