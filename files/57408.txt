Antibiotic Treatment Effects on Intratumoral Bacteria Modulation in Surgical Patients With Oral Cancer
The goal of this phase II single arm clinical study is to evaluate the effect of antibiotics (metronidazole) and oral chlorhexidine (CHX) in reducing the bacteria load within tumors of patients undergoing surgery for oral cancer.

The prognosis for patients with locally advanced, non-Human Papillomavirus (HPV) associated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remains poor. The immunosuppressive tumor immune microenvironment in HNSCC presents a significant barrier to both conventional and immune-based therapies. Recent studies have indicated that dysbiotic oral microbiota, particularly in the context of periodontal disease, can contribute to chronic oral mucosal inflammation and the recruitment of suppressive immune cell infiltrates. Bacterial-induced chronic inflammation may play a crucial role in treatment resistance in HNSCC. Understanding the impact of microbial modulation on the tumor immune microenvironment in HNSCC could lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets.

In this single-arm phase II clinical trial, oral cancer patients will be treated with oral metronidazole and CHX rinses prior to surgery. Investigator will assess the ability for the treatment to reduce the absolute amount of intratumoral bacteria and evaluate changes in the intratumoral bacterial community and infiltrating immune cells.
