High-Dose Chemotherapy, Total-Body Irradiation, and Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation or Bone Marrow Transplantation in Treating Patients With Hematologic Cancer or Solid Tumors
RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage cancer cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation or autologous bone marrow transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more cancer cells.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well eight different high-dose chemotherapy regimens with or without total-body irradiation followed by autologous stem cell transplantation or autologous bone marrow transplantation works in treating patients with hematologic malignancies or solid tumors.

OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the morbidity, mortality, and overall outcome in patients with hematologic malignancies, breast cancer, or other chemosensitive solid tumors treated with disease-specific dose-intensive conditioning regimens and autologous peripheral blood or bone marrow transplantation.

OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to risk group (standard vs high). Standard risk includes acute leukemia in first relapse or second remission; lymphoma in responding first relapse or second remission; or breast cancer at risk for recurrence. High risk includes all others. Patients receive specific conditioning regimens according to diagnosis as outlined below.

Conditioning

* Regimen A (standard risk non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and under 60 years of age)-Etoposide, cyclophosphamide, and total body irradiation (TBI) (VCT): Patients receive etoposide IV continuously over 26 hours beginning on day -5 and cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on day -4. Patients undergo TBI on days -3 to -1.
* Regimen B (any risk Hodgkin's lymphoma and under 60 years of age)-Cyclophosphamide, carmustine, and etoposide (CBV): Patients receive etoposide IV continuously over 34 hours beginning on day -8; cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -7 to -4; and carmustine IV over 2 hours on day -3.
* Regimen C (any risk patient with prior exposure to high-dose etoposide and cyclophosphamide and under 60 years of age)-Melphalan and TBI (MEL/TBI): Patients receive melphalan IV over 30 minutes on day -4. Patients undergo TBI on days -3 to -1.
* Regimen D (multiple myeloma or amyloidosis)-Melphalan only (MEL only): Patients receive melphalan IV over 30 minutes on day -2.
* Regimen E (any patient unable to receive TBI)-Busulfan and cyclophosphamide: Patients receive oral busulfan (or busulfan IV over 2 hours) on days -7 to -4 and cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -3 and -2.
* Regimen F (any risk breast cancer)-Cyclophosphamide, carboplatin, and thiotepa (STAMP V): Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 24 hours, carboplatin IV over 24 hours, and thiotepa IV over 24 hours on days -7 to -4.
* Regimen G (solid tumors other than breast or testicular cancer)-Thiotepa and carboplatin (TT/CARBO): Patients receive thiotepa IV over 2 hours on days -6 and -5 and carboplatin IV continuously over 96 hours beginning on day -6.
* Regimen H (recurrent or primary progressive testicular cancer)-Etoposide and carboplatin (VP/CARBO): Patients receive etoposide IV over 2 hours and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on days -6 to -4.

Stem Cell Infusion

* In all regimens, patients undergo autologous stem cell infusion on day 0. Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 450 patients (50 patients \[25 per stratum\] per regimen) will be accrued for this study within 10 years.
