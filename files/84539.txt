Methotrexate, Tafasitamab, Lenalidomide and Rituximab in Patients With PCNSL
Pilot-trial of Methotrexate, Tafasitamab (Minjuvi®), Lenalidomide (Revlimid®) and Rituximab in patients ineligible for HCT-ASCT with Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL)
Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
DRUG: Tafasitamab|DRUG: Lenalidomide|DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Methotrexate
complete response rate (CRR), The CRR will be determined by IRC and according to IPCG criteria. This endpoint reflects the proportion of patients who can potentially proceed to different consolidation or maintenance strategies to achieve durable responses., At the end of cycle 2 (each cycle is 21 days)
Best overall response rate (BORR), is defined as the rate of patients having achieved a CR or PR according to at least one post-baseline tumor assessment, At the end of cycle 4 (each cycle is 21 days)|Progression-free survival (PFS), will be calculated for each patient as time between the start of treatment with MTR2 and the date of first progression, relapse or death or, in cases of continuing response, the date of the last documented follow-up (FU-CRF or written medical report)., After 1 year|Overall survival (OS), will be calculated for each patient as time between the start of treatment with MTR2 and the date of death or the date of the last documented follow-up (FU-CRF or written medical report)., After 1 year|Incidence and severity of adverse events, Incidence and severity of adverse events, including toxic deaths during induction therapy will be summarized based on CTCAE grades, during induction therapy
This is a single-arm, prospective, multicenter, single-stage phase-II trial for patients aged 18-69 years with ECOG PS ≥2 or ≥70 years with previously untreated PCNSL, who are not eligible for HCT-ASCT at investigators decision. This trial evaluates the CRR rate after at least 2 cycles of MTR2, the incidence and severity of adverse events, progression-free survival, and overall survival after one year.

It is planned to enroll eligible patients with PCNSL, i.e. who receive at least 2 cycles of the combination of rituximab, MTX and the IMPs tafasitamab and lenalidomide, over a one-year period. Follow-up will be conducted for 1 year within the trial.
