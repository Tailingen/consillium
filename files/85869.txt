Unilateral Versus Bilateral Stents for Bismuth Type II and III Malignant Hilar Strictures
The aim of the present study was to compare the effect of unilateral versus bilateral stenting in patients with malignant hilar obstruction.
Cholangiocarcinoma
PROCEDURE: ERCP plus one biliary stent|PROCEDURE: ERCP plus two biliary stents
Early complications, 30 days within treatment
30-day mortality, 30 days within treatment|Late complications, 30 days after treatment|Median survival, From stent insertion to the death of the patient|Successful drainage, One month after stent insertion
Cholangiocarcinoma accounts for 3% of all gastrointestinal cancers and is the second commonest primary liver cancer. However only a few patients are suitable for surgical resection and therefore endoscopic biliary drainage is the most used palliative treatment modality for malignant hilar stricture. However, whether one or two stents can benefit the patients most is still to be defined. Numerous retrospective case series reached different conclusion, till now, only one randomized trial compared the effect of unilateral versus bilateral stenting in patients with malignant hilar obstruction, nonetheless, nearly one third of the patients had Bismuth Type I stricture, and one stent is enough for drainage in this situation, therefore, the best drainage strategy for patients with Bismuth Type II or Bismuth Type III malignant hilar obstruction is unknown. The aim of the present study was to compare the effect of unilateral versus bilateral stenting in patients with Bismuth Type II or III malignant hilar obstruction.
