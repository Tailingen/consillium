Cetuximab, Irinotecan, Toripalimab in RAS/BRAF Wild-type Ultraselected Right-sided Colorectal Cancer Study
The objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cetuximab combined with PD-1 inhibitor and irinotecan in negative ultraselection RAS/BRAF wild-type refractory right-sided metastatic colorectal cancer.

The present study focuses on exploring the effectiveness and safety of cetuximab combined with a PD-1 inhibitor and irinotecan in treating refractory, right-sided metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients who are negative ultraselected for RAS/BRAF mutations. Colorectal cancer ranks among the most prevalent digestive malignancies globally, with right-sided mCRC generally exhibiting poorer outcomes than left-sided cases. Current treatment guidelines vary based on genetic mutations and tumor location, recommending cetuximab for left-sided RAS/BRAF wild-type mCRC and alternative therapies for right-sided or mutated cases. Despite limited clinical data on EGFR inhibitors for right-sided mCRC, retrospective analyses suggest varying efficacy outcomes. The study aims to address these gaps by investigating cetuximab and PD-1 inhibitor combination therapy in this specific patient population, potentially enhancing treatment options for refractory mCRC.
