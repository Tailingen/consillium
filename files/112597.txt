Application of Intrahepatic Arterial Infusion Chemotherapy for Patients With High Risk of Liver Metastases After Pancreatic Cancer Surgery
Clinical results on intra-arterial adjuvant chemotherapy for prevention

of liver metastasis following curative resection of pancreatic cancer
Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma|Who Have High CTCs Count in Portal Venous Blood|Liver Metastases
DEVICE: Intrahepatic Arterial Infusion
Death, Overall survival time after operation, up to 12 months
In this study, the investigator try to select 80 patients who received radical surgery for pancreatic cancer, whose circulating tumor cells(CTCs) count then performed on intraoperative portal venous blood to predict postoperative liver metastasis and were divided into two groups. for those who have high CTCs count may have more chance for the occurrence of postoperative liver metastasis was applied hepatic arterial perfusion chemotherapy with minimal dynamic randomization. The aim is to evaluate the feasibility of hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy for the prevention of postoperative liver metastasis and improvement of prognosis of pancreatic cancer, so as to further improve postoperative management of pancreatic cancer
