Safety and Toxicity Study of Intravesical Instillation of TARA-002 in Adults with High-grade Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (Phase 1b)
This study is open-label dose expansion study to investigate the safety and toxicity of intravesical treatment of high-grade NMIBC (HGTa or CIS, including CIS with concomitant Ta) after transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) and/or biopsy using TARA-002 in adults unable to obtain intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), adults who have received at least one dose of intravesical BCG or adults who have received at least one dose of intravesical chemotherapy.

After completion of the dose escalation phase (Phase 1a) and after the RP2D has been established, the dose expansion phase (Phase 1b) will start enrollment of subjects with CIS NMIBC with active disease to further evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of TARA-002, at the established RP2D. CIS NMIBC with active disease is defined as disease present at the last cystoscopic evaluation prior to signing the ICF. Subjects enrolled in the dose expansion phase will not include subjects previously enrolled and treated in the dose escalation phase.

All subjects will receive 6 weeks of treatment at the established RP2D.
