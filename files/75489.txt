Intercostal Cryoanalgesia for Chronic Pain After VATS Lung Resection
Intercostal cryoanalgesia is a technique that allows extensive and prolonged analgesia of the hemithorax. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of intercostal cryoanalgesia as an adjunct to a single-injection paravertebral block for the prevention of chronic thoracic pain after VATS lung resection surgery.

VATS lung resection is associated with a high incidence of persistent thoracic pain. To our knowledge, there is no study on the effect of cryoanalgesia on the incidence and severity of chronic thoracic pain 3 months after VATS lung resection.

Intercostal cryoanalgesia is a technique that allows extensive and prolonged analgesia of the hemithorax. In a recent study by Ilfeld \& al, intercostal cryoanalgesia (combined with a single-injection paravertebral block) was able to drastically lower the incidence of chronic pain after total mastectomy compared to the use of the paravertebral block alone (3% vs 17%).

The aim of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of intercostal cryoanalgesia for the prevention of chronic thoracic pain after VATS lung resection surgery.
