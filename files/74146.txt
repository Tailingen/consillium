Mechanism Investigation of R-CHOP Regimen or Tucidinostat Plus R-CHOP (CR-CHOP) Regimen in the Treatment of BCL2/MYC Protein Double Expressor Lymphoma
This study is trying to explore the mechanism of R-CHOP regimen or tucidinostat plus R-CHOP (CR-CHOP) regimen in the treatment of BCL2/MYC protein double expressor lymphoma.
Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)|Double Expressor Lymphoma
Event Free Survival (EFS), Defined as the duration from the date of randomization to the date of disease progression, relapse from CR , initiation of subsequent systemic antilymphoma therapy for residual disease, or death, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 5 years
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Defined as the duration from the date of randomization to the date of progression, relapse from CR, or death, whichever occurred first., Up to approximately 5 years
Tucidinostat (formerly known as chidamide) is an oral subtype-selective histone deacetylase inhibitor. This study is trying to explore the mechanism of R-CHOP regimen or tucidinostat plus R-CHOP (CR-CHOP) regimen in the treatment of BCL2/MYC protein double expressor lymphoma. We will retain the hematoxylin and eosin (HE) -stained slides of tumor tissue, immunohistochemical staining slides for BCL2 and MYC, as well as FFPE (Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded) tissues. We will conduct biological tests via digital pathology and DNA sequencing, aiming to uncover the pathogenic mechanism of double expressor lymphoma and the potential therapeutic targets of CR-CHOP regimen.
