Several studies have shown a potential anti-tumor role for cannabinoids by modulating cell signaling pathways, inhibiting angiogenesis, inducing apoptosis, and overcoming chemotherapy resistance. In phase I trials, cannabinoids have been shown to enhance the uptake of chemotherapy into malignant cells without affecting normal cells. The investigators seeks to demonstrate that the combination of chemotherapy with BRCX014 will have a greater anti-tumor and anti-proliferative activity when compared to standard of care alone.
