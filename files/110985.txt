Artificial Intelligence Analysis for Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Screening Breast Cancer in High-risk Women
Use Convolutional Neural Networks Analysis for Classification of Contrast-enhancing Lesions at Multiparametric Breast MRI. Build an abbreviated protocal, and investigate whether an abbreviated protocol was suitable for breast magnetic resonance imaging screening for breast cancer in high-risk Chinese women, which can shorten the examination time and avoid enhanced imaging while ensuring the accuracy of the diagnosis.
