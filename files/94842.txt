Application of ctDNA in the Evaluation of Curative Effect and Prognosis of SCLC Patients
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the application value of circulating tumor DNA(ctDNA) with efficacy evaluation and prognostic assessment in patients with unresectable SCLC, who were receiving radiotherapy and chemotherapy treatment.
Small Cell Lung Cancer Extensive Stage
OTHER: Observation
ctDNA mutation profile at baseline, ctDNA mutation will be detected, PyClone based clonal analysis will be performed to analyze the clonal dominance, before treatment ctDNA mutation analysis and clonal analysis (each cycle is 3 weeks)|the evolution of ctDNA mutation profile during treatment, ctDNA mutation will be detected, PyClone based clonal analysis will be performed to analyze the clonal dominance, After the first cycle of first line treatment upon physicians' request, ctDNA mutation analysis and clonal analysis (each cycle is 3 weeks)|the evolution of ctDNA mutation profile during treatment, ctDNA mutation will be detected, PyClone based clonal analysis will be performed to analyze the clonal dominance, After finished the first line treatment, ctDNA mutation analysis and clonal analysis (each cycle is 3 weeks)
PFS, Progression free of survival, From the first line treatment to the time of disease progression (through study completion, an average of 5 months)
1. According to each point in time of ctDNA, to analyze the dynamic changes of tumor burden and clonal subtypes which to evaluate the application value of ctDNA in curative efficacy evaluation.
2. Compare the two time points before and after radiotherapy and chemotherapy treatment of the cell free DNA (cfDNA) concentration and tumor burden, analysis the correlation between the changes and prognosis.
