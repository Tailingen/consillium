KPD Consolidation After ASCT in NDMM Patients
This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of post-transplant consolidation therapy with the KPD regimen (carfilzomib, pomalidomide, and dexamethasone) versus no consolidation, followed by maintenance therapy, in patients with transplant-eligible newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (TE-NDMM). The primary goal is to compare minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity rates and overall treatment outcomes between the two groups.

Minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity rate prior to maintenance therapy, The primary endpoint of this study is to compare the minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity rate prior to maintenance therapy in transplant-eligible newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) patients who receive KPD consolidation therapy versus those who do not receive consolidation therapy after triplet or quadraplet induction therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT)., 36 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR), Compare the overall response rate (ORR) including the rates of stringent complete response (sCR), complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR) and partial response (PR), prior to maintenance therapy according to the IMWG (International Myeloma Working Group) assessment criteria, between the two treatment groupsã€‚, 36 months

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignancy characterized by abnormal proliferation of plasma cells, leading to organ damage and poor prognosis. Despite advances in treatment, including autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), the disease remains incurable for most patients. Post-transplant consolidation and maintenance therapies have emerged as critical strategies to deepen remission and prolong progression-free survival (PFS). However, the role of consolidation therapy remains debated. This study aims to clarify whether KPD consolidation therapy after ASCT provides additional benefits compared to direct maintenance therapy.
