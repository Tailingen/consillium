Overcoming Chemotherapy Resistance In Refractory Multiple Myeloma With Simvastatin and Zoledronic Acid
The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of simvastatin and zoledronic acid on M-protein and/or free light chains when added to conventional chemotherapy for the treatment of multiple myeloma patients.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Simvastatin and zoledronic acid
Change in Paraprotein Level and Free Light Chain (FLC) Ratio From Baseline Measurement, The effect of simvastatin and zolendronic acid on M-Protein and FLC ratio will be measured 4 weeks after treatment begins, then every 4 weeks until progression of disease., 4 weeks after treatment begins
Overall Survival, OS(Overall survival) is measured from date of study enrollment until death., At start of year 2 of follow-up on all surviving participants|Duration of Response, Response will be accessed by one of the study investigators at each monthly follow up visit during year one., Year 1 follow up visits occur monthly|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Study will estimate PFS when there is one year of follow up data for all surviving participants, At start of year 2 follow up on all surviving participants|Duration of Response, Response will be assessed by one of the study investigators at each three month follow up visit for Year 2, Year 2 follow up visit occur every three months|Duration of Response, Response will be assessed by one of the study investigators at each six month follow up visit for Year 3-5, Year 3-5 follow up visit occurs every six months|Incidence Rate of Toxicity, Descriptive statistics will be provided regarding incidence rates of toxicity. Patients will be monitored for safety throughout the study., Every 12 months up to one month after treatment completion|Comparison of Quality of Life Scores, The QOL scores taken at the start of the study and every 4 months after treatment starts will be analyzed using Wilcoxon test for paired differences, Up to 2 months after last treatment has been completed
We hypothesize that the addition of simvastatin and zoledronic acid to bortezomib, thalidomide, melphalan or dexamethasone based regimens will decrease drug resistance when treating refractory multiple myeloma. We hypothesize that the addition of simvastatin and zoledronic acid will not increase the chemotherapy toxicity significantly and will be tolerable for patients. We believe simvastatin and zoledronic acid have antitumor properties and will contribute to reversal of resistance. Treatment will be significantly enhanced when these agents are combined
