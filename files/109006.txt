Chemotherapy Plus Immunotherapy Combined With SBRT as Neoadjuvant Therapy for Patients With Resectable NSCLC
In this study, patients with EGFR/ALK wild-type, resectable locally advanced NSCLC are expected to receive 1 cycle of chemoimmunotherapy as neoadjuvant therapy, followed by SBRT to the primary lung lesion, and chemoimmunotherapy for 2 cycles. Surgical treatment will be given within 4-6 weeks after the last cycle of chemoimmunotherapy, then immunotherapy maintenance for 1 year.
