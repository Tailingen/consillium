Creatine Supplementation and Resistance Training to Preserve Muscle Mass and Attenuate Cancer Progression
The goal of this clinical trial is to test the use of creatine monohydrate supplementation with resistance training to preserve muscle mass and help lessen prostate cancer progression.

The main question it aims to answer is if this treatment will help maintain muscle mass to help in reducing fatigue and improving physical function, independence, and quality of life.

Participants will be asked to participate in a 52-week exercise intervention consisting of a twice weekly telehealth resistance training program.

This is a parallel, double-blind randomized controlled trial to test the effects of 52-weeks of creatine monohydrate supplementation with resistance training (Cr+RT) compared with placebo (PLA) and RT (PLA+RT) with our team's established, effective, home-based, telehealth RT program in 200 metastatic castration sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) survivors receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). We will evaluate muscle mass, health outcomes (fatigue, physical function, independence, insulin sensitivity, quality of life), and markers or cancer progression (prostate specific antigen, cell-free DNA) at baseline, mid-point, and 52-weeks. RT will be carried out twice weekly with elastic resistance bands, and we will utilize an established creatine monohydrate supplementation protocol for creatine and PLA delivery.
