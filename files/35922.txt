Predictive Value of 99mTc- Albumin Spheres Before 90Y- SIR Therapy
The purpose of this study is to assess the predictive value of 99mTechnetium (Tc)- labeled albumin in macroaggregates (MAA) and in microspheres (B20) injected into the common hepatic artery for the distribution of 90Yttrium- Selective Internal Radiotherapy (SIRT)-spheres (SIR- spheres).

Patients with metastases of colorectal tumors will be included into this study provided that they are scheduled for 90Y SIR spheres therapy for clinical reasons. Before 90Y SIR spheres therapy, patients will receive a diagnostic examination with injection of MAA (group A) or B20 (group B) into the common hepatic artery to rule out a relevant shunt volume to the lung or other extra-hepatic locations (e.g., stomach) as recommended by the manufacturer. After the diagnostic scan, therapy with SIR- spheres will be conducted in 2 separate sessions with selective injection of 90Y labeled SIR spheres into the right and left hepatic artery at two separate occasions (routine procedure at the University of Magdeburg, Germany). In addition, therapeutic sessions will include the selective injection of MAA or B20 into the right / left hepatic artery according to a predefined plan (either alone or as a mixture with the SIR spheres).The intra-hepatic distribution of 90Y labeled SIR spheres will be assessed using "Bremsstrahlen"- Single- Photon- Emission- Computed- Tomography (SPECT)- imaging, the distribution of MAA and B20 will be assessed using SPECT imaging.
