A Study to Determine the Efficiency For Brain Metastasis NSCLC Patients Treated With Icotinib Alone or Combined With Radiation Therapy
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of icotinib alone or in combination with radiation therapy for NSCLC patients harboring EGFR mutation with brain metastases. The primary endpoint is overall survival .

Overall Survival, from date of randomization until the date of death, assessed up to 36 months.
Progression-free survival of intracranial lesions, from date of randomization until the date of progression, assessed up to 10 months|disease control rate of intracranial lesions, from date of randomization until the date of progression, assessed up to 18 months|Quality of life measured by FACT-L/LCS 4.0, measured by FACT-L/LCS 4.0, from date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 36 months|Neurocognitive function changes measured by MMSE, measured by MMSE, from date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 36 months|Observing acute and late toxicity assessed by CTCAE v4.0, Assessed by CTCAE v4.0, from date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 36 months
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the malignant tumors with the highest incidence of brain metastases, and most patients died due to the progression of brain metastases. Some research show that icotinib combined with radiation therapy can improve the efficiency of NSCLC with brain metastases, but there is still controversial about the timing of radiation therapy intervention . This study is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, controlled trial of icotinib combined with early intervention or late intervention radiation therapy for NSCLC patients harboring EGFR mutation with brain metastases. They will be treated with icotinib and divided into 2 groups. Group 1: the radiation therapy will start within 1 month after icotinib treatment; Group2: the patients will be treated with icotinib first, radiation therapy intervene if disease progress.
