18F-DOPA-PET in Finding Tumors in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Gliomas Undergoing Radiation Therapy
This phase II trial studies how well fluorine F 18 fluorodopa (18F-DOPA)-positron emission tomography (PET) works in finding tumors in patients with newly diagnosed gliomas undergoing radiation therapy. Comparing results of diagnostic procedures done before and during radiation therapy may help doctors predict a patient's response to treatment and help plan the best treatment.

Proportion of Grade IV MGMT Un-methylated Patients That Experience Confirmed-progression-free Survival at 6 Months (CPFS6), The proportion of Grade IV MGMT un-methylated patients that experience confirmed-progression-free survival at 6 months (CPFS6). Progression is defined by any of the following:

* â‰¥25% increase in the sum of products of perpendicular diameters of enhancing lesions compared to the smallest tumor measurement obtained either at baseline or best response, on stable or increasing doses of corticosteroids
* Significant increase in T2/FLAIR non-enhancing lesion on stable or increasing doses of corticosteroids compared to baseline scan or best response following initiation of therapy, not due to co-morbid events
* Any new lesion
* Clear clinical deterioration not attributable to other causes apart from the tumor or changes in corticosteroid dose.
* Failure to return for evaluation due to death or deteriorating condition
* Clear progression of non-measurable disease, Time from registration to the confirmed disease progression, assessed at 6 months
