A Study of BCMA-directed CAR-T Cells Treatment in Subjects With r/r Multiple Myeloma
This is a single-center, non-randomized study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of C-CAR088 in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma patient.
Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
BIOLOGICAL: C-CAR088
Safety: The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), 30 days
Overall response rate (ORR), 12 months|Progression free survival (PFS), 6 months, 12 months|The CART cell duration in vivo, The copys of BCMA-CART DNA in peripheral blood with qPCR method, 12 months|The soluble BCMA changes in peripheral blood, The amount of soluble BCMA in peripheral blood with ELISA method, 12 months
The study will include the following sequential phases: Screening, Pre-Treatment (Cell Product Preparation, Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy), C-CAR088 infusion and Follow-up.
