ENVAFOLIMAB Single-agent Treatment in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
An open, single-arm, multi-center Phase II clinical study of ENVAFOLIMAB single-agent treatment in patients with advanced solid tumors,to compare the overall response rate of TMB-high and TMB-Low,to determine the cut off value between TMB-high and TMB-Low of diagnosis device.Then,observe the efficacy of ENVAFOLIMAB uesd comfirmed TMB-H Value
Solid Tumor
DRUG: Envafolimab
ORR, To evaluate the objective response rate of Envafolimab in patients with advanced solid tumors with high tumor mutation burden (TMB-H) \[Blind Independent Imaging Review Committee (BIRC) evaluation\], up to approximately half past one year
ORR, To evaluate the objective response rate of Envafolimab in patients with TMB-H and TMB-L advanced solid tumors (investigator assessment), Up to approximately half past one year|DCR, To evaluate the disease control rateof Envafolimab in patients with TMB-H and TMB-L advanced solid tumors, Up to approximately half past one year|DoR, To evaluate the duration of remission of Envafolimab in patients with TMB-H and TMB-L advanced solid tumors, Up to approximately half past one year|PFS, To evaluate the progression-free survival of Envafolimab in patients with TMB-H and TMB-L advanced solid tumors, Up to approximately half past one year|OS, To evaluate the overall survival of Envafolimab in patients with TMB-H and TMB-L advanced solid tumors, Up to approximately half past one year
The enrolled subjects will receive envafolimab treatment during the treatment phase, and the dosage and usage is 400 mg envafolimab subcutaneously injected every four weeks, 28 days as a treatment cycle.

The study treatment continued to reach the standard of stopping treatment. During this period, the efficacy, safety and PK will be evaluated according to the visit process.In this study, imaging examinations (CT or MRI) were used to evaluate the efficacy at baseline and during the study period. The results of the examination were evaluated based on the efficacy evaluation criteria for solid tumors (RECIST1.1) and irRECIST criteria.
