DNR and AraC Combined to Fractionated MylotargÂ® in Patients With First Relapse of AML
For several years, the effective standard induction chemotherapy for AML has been limited to the association of anthracycline and aracytine. GO is the first effective targeted antibody used in leukemia patients. In a previous study, we showed efficacy and safety of fractionated doses of GO used as a single agent for treatment of adult AML patients in first relapse. In the present study the possibility of combining fractionated doses of GO to escalated doses of a 3+7 regimen old is studied in relapsed AML patients \> 50 and \<70 years.

Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) defined by the occurrence of any G3 or G4 non reversible toxicity at day 45 excluding myelosuppression or infection due to neutropenia, and response defined by complete remission at day 45, Day 45 post first dose of treatment
Secondary endpoint: Duration of second remission in AML patients treated for relapse with chemotherapy + Mylotarg as re-induction and consolidation., At two years
Induction course are:

GO 3mg/m2 on days 1, 4,7 + the three dose levels were as follows:

level 1: DNR: 45 mg/m2 x 3 days + AraC: 100 mg/m2 x 7 days level 2: DNR: 60 mg/m2 x 3 days + AraC: 100 mg/m2 x 7 days level 3: DNR 60 mg/m2 x 3 days + AraC: 200 mg/m2 x 7 days. with 20 mg of methylprednisolone prior to each GO infusion. Consolidation course: patients in CR may receive 2 additional courses of consolidation chemotherapy with Amsacrine 90 mg/m2 daily for 3 days, and Ara-C (1g/m2/12 hours x 3 days) + GO 3 mg/m2 on day 1.
