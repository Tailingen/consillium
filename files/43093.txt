LBH589 Plus Decitabine for Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) or Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
This study is designed to evaluate the combination of LBH589 and decitabine in patients age ≥ 60 years with high risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome (IPSS Int-2 or High) or Acute Myeloid Leukemia.
Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute|Myelodysplastic Syndromes
DRUG: LBH589|DRUG: Decitabine
Phase I: Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of LBH589 When Given in Combination With Decitabine, Completion of Phase I enrollment for MTD (approximately 26 months)|Phase II: Overall Rate of Morphologic Complete Remission (CR) + Cytogenetic Complete Remission (CRc) + Morphologic Complete Remission With Incomplete Blood Count Recovery (CRi), * Morphologic complete remission (CR). A CR designation requires that the patient achieve the morphologic leukemia-free state with less than 5% blasts in an aspirate sample with marrow spicules and with a count of at least 200 nucleated cells. There should be no blasts with Auer rods or persistence of extramedullary disease. Patients must also have an absolute neutrophil count of more than 1,000/μLand platelets of 100,000/μL.
* Cytogenetic complete remission (CRc). A CRc will be defined by the achievement of a CR with reversion to a normal karyotype in a minimum of 20 metaphases analyzed by cytogenetics.
* Morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi): Achievement of all of the criteria for CR except for residual neutropenia (\< 1,000/μL) or thrombocytopenia (\< 100,000/μL)., Up to 12 months
Rate of Cytogenetic Complete Remission (CRc), Cytogenetic complete remission (CRc). A CRc will be defined by the achievement of a CR with reversion to a normal karyotype in a minimum of 20 metaphases analyzed by cytogenetics., Up to 12 months|Changes in Quality of Life Scores as Measured by the Function Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Leukemia (FACT-Leu) Version 4, -The FACT-Leu consists of a 27-item compilation of general questions divided into four primary quality of life domains: physical well-being, social/family well being, emotional well-being, and functional well-being along with a 17 item subscale developed specifically for patients with leukemia., Up to approximately 12 months after start of treatment|Time to Response, Time to response is defined as the date of the first dose of study drug to the date that all criteria for CR or CRi are fulfilled., Up to 12 months|Safety and Tolerability of Regimen as Measured by the Rate of the Most Common Adverse Events Experienced, Adverse events will be assessed according to the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0., Up to 13 months after start of treatment|Remission Duration, Defined as the first date that all criteria for CR, CRi or HI are fulfilled to the date of treatment failure, relapse from CR, or death due to any cause., Completion of follow-up (median follow-up was 58 months)|Progression-free Survival, Completion of follow-up (median follow-up was 58 months)|Event-free Survival, Event-free survival is defined as the interval from the date of first dose of study drug to date of treatment failure, relapse from CR, or death due to any cause., Completion of follow-up (median follow-up was 58 months)|Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the date of first dose of study drug to the date of death from any cause., Completion of follow-up (median follow-up was 58 months)|Rates of Morphologic Complete Remission With Incomplete Count Recovery (CRi), Morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi): Achievement of all of the criteria for CR except for residual neutropenia (\< 1,000/μL) or thrombocytopenia (\< 100,000/μL)., Up to 12 months|Rate of Hematologic Improvement., -Hematologic improvement (HI). Includes the following categories:

* Erythroid response: Hemoglobin increase by ≥ 1.5 g/dL over baseline in which the pretreatment hemoglobin is \< 11 g/dL or reduction of RBC transfusions of at least 4 RBC transfusions / 8 wk compared with the pretreatment transfusion number in the previous 8 weeks.
* Platelet response. Absolute increase of \> 30 x 10\^9/L for patients starting with 20 x 10\^9/L or increase from \< 20 x 10\^9/L to \> 20 x 109/L and by at least 100%
* Neutrophil response. At least 100% increase and an absolute increase \> 0.5 x 109/L for patients with pretreatment neutrophils \< 1.0 x 109/L), Up to 12 months
To address the need for less toxic, more effective treatments for older patients with advanced MDS and AML, the purpose of this Phase 1-2 single institution study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of LBH 589 and decitabine administered in combination.

Decitabine is an epigenetic modifier of gene expression that has been shown to be well-tolerated in this population at the dose schedule proposed in this study, with reasonable efficacy. Although its precise mechanism of action is incompletely understood, it is postulated to work by reactivating the expression of key tumor suppressor genes silenced in tumor cells by reversing a pattern of hypermethylation of promotor elements.

LBH389 is likewise an epigenetic modifier that inhibits the deacetylation of both histones and non-histone proteins, including HSP90 and p53. Although clinical experience with LBH589 in AML is limited, aberrant histone deacetylase activity has been previously shown to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of AML. The addition of LBH589 to a decitabine regimen of previously established efficacy and tolerability will allow us to evaluate the hypothesis that two epigenetic modifiers that are believed to work through distinct mechanisms of action may act together to improve the responses of patients treated with decitabine alone, without significant additional toxicity.
