Topical Sunscreen in Preventing Skin Rash in Patients Receiving Drugs Such as Erlotinib or Cetuximab for Cancer
RATIONALE: Topical sunscreen may be effective in preventing skin rash caused by treatment with drugs such as erlotinib or cetuximab. It is not yet known whether topical sunscreen is more effective than a placebo in preventing skin rash in patients receiving drugs such as erlotinib or cetuximab for cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying topical sunscreen to see how well it works compared with a placebo in preventing skin rash in patients receiving drugs such as erlotinib or cetuximab for cancer.
Dermatologic Complications|Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific
DRUG: sunscreen|OTHER: placebo
Incidence and severity of rash development by Skindex questionnaire, Up to 8 weeks
Toxicity by NCI CTCAE v3.0, Up to 8 weeks|Rash incidence at 4 and 8 weeks, Up to 8 weeks
OBJECTIVES:

* Compare the incidence and severity of erlotinib-, cetuximab-, or other epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor-induced skin rash development in patients with cancer treated with prophylactic topical sunscreen vs placebo.
* Determine the toxicity of topical sunscreen vs placebo in these patients.
* Determine whether discontinuation of treatment intervention is followed by rash development.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are stratified according to chemotherapy regimen (first-line chemotherapy vs other), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor therapy (small molecule vs monoclonal antibodies), concurrent medication that increases sun hypersensitivity (yes vs no), and gender. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

* Arm I: Patients apply sunscreen generously to the entire body twice daily for 4 weeks.
* Arm I: Patients apply placebo generously to the entire body twice daily for 4 weeks.

Patients complete self-reported questionnaires regarding their rash status at baseline and then weekly for 8 weeks.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 8 weeks.
