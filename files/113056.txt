Cabozantinib and Pembrolizumab for Advanced Metastatic Melanoma
The study aims to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of the combination of cabozantinib and pembrolizumab in advanced melanoma
Advanced Metastatic Melanoma
DRUG: Cabozantinib|DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Phase 1: Incidence of dose limiting toxicities using CTCAE, Version 4.03, All adverse events (AEs )will be considered in DLT assessment unless an event is clearly unrelated to trial treatment. The National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.03 will be used., Initiation of treatment up to 2 years|Phase 2: Best overall response rate (ORR) (complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)) per RECIST v1.1, Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 will be used to determine ORR., Initiation of treatment up to 2 years
Determine disease control rate (DCR) according to RECIST v1.1 criteria, DCR defined as the percentage of patients achieving CR+PR +SD, Initiation of treatment up to 2 years|Radiologic progression-free survival (PFS) per RECIST v1.1, PFS is defined as the time between the first dose of study therapy and the earliest date of progression or death (participants who have neither progressed nor died will be censored at the most recent last-known-alive date)., Initiation of treatment up to 2 years|Summarize overall survival (OS) with the method of Kaplan-Meier, OS is defined as defined as the time between the first dose of study therapy and death (participants who have not died will be censored at the most recent last-known-alive date)., Initiation of treatment up to 2 years
This is an open-label, Phase 1b/2 trial for adults with advanced melanoma. The objective of the Phase 1b portion of the study is to establish the recommended Phase 2 dose of cabozantinib in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with unresectable melanoma and assess the safety and tolerability of the combined treatments. The objective of the Phase 2 portion of the study is to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of the established dose of cabozantinib in combination with pembrolizumab as measured by best overall response rate (ORR) (complete response \[CR\] + partial response \[PR\]) with the combination of agents in patients with unresectable stage III or stage IV melanoma.
