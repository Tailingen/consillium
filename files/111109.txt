Effects of Acupuncture on Aromatase Inhibitor-Induced Joint Pain
Researchers at the John Wayne Cancer Institute (JWCI) at Providence Saint John's Health Center (PSJHC) are trying to examine whether acupuncture reduces joint pain in patients being treated with aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy for breast cancer and whether the reduction in pain happens by lowering inflammation.
Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: Acupuncture Therapy
Joint Pain tabulated from Joint Pain Assessment Questionnaire, Investigators will serially measure joint pain symptoms using questionnaires administered at pre-determined time points. A summary of pain scores will be tabulated for all visits., 3 years
Adaptive immune response as measured by cytokine levels, Investigators will collect prospective blood samples to test for for cytokine levels, 3 years|Innate immune response as measured by cytokime levels, Investigators will collect prospective blood samples to test for cytokine levels, 3 years
The investigators propose to investigate the effect of acupuncture on patients experiencing joint pain from aromatase inhibitor therapy. The investigators will serially measure patient's symptoms and track current medications, joint pain, daily activities, fatigue, and quality of life. The investigators will collect peripheral blood at baseline, weeks 4 and 7, one week after the last acupuncture treatment and 4 weeks after the last acupuncture treatment. The investigators will study the samples collected at the five predetermined time-points to test for immune parameters, such as the innate and adaptive immune responses, as well as the proliferative capabilities and pro-inflammatory mediators reflected in innate and adaptive functional immune responses.
