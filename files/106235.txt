Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Prepectoral Breast Reconstruction
The study plans to compare conventional submuscular reconstruction with definitive implant and muscle sparing reconstruction with definitive implant in selected patients. The two techniques are compared in terms of patient quality of life and satisfaction; patient related outcomes, reconstruction morbidity, early and late complications are also investigated.
Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: Prepectoral reconstruction|PROCEDURE: Submuscolar reconstruction
Satisfaction assessed by the BREAST-Q, The BREAST-Q survey is used to detect differences in patient satisfaction among the groups, 1 year
Immediate complications rate, Compare post operative complications, 1 month|Short term complications rate, Compare short term post operative complications, 6 months|Long term complications rate, Compare long term post operative complications, 24 months|Percentage of capsular contracture, Compare overall aesthetic outcomes (percentage of capsular contracture) using standardized photographs assessed by independent blinded observers, 1 year

The study plans to collect robust data to support the prepectoral implant placement and complete coverage of implant with acellular dermal matrix in the clinical practice.

Consequently, the project plans to move toward evidence-based medicine in breast reconstruction, avoiding marketing influences and surgeon experience as the sole source of evidence.
