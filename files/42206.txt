Pain Management During a Photodynamic Therapy Session on the Vertex for Actinic Keratosis: Tumescent Anesthesia Interest
This study focus on the efficacity of tumescent anesthesia in pain management during a photodynamic therapy on the vertex for treatment of actinic keratosis. To do this we carried out a prospective, randomized, controlled, open-ended study. Our aim is to show a 40% reduction in pain during photodynamic therapy session compared to a conventionally used analgesic method (paracetamol + cold water)
Pain|Actinic Keratosis|Analgesia|Phototerapy|Vertex
DRUG: Procedure (Tumesent anesthesia)|DRUG: Control Arm (Paracetamol)
Pain Intensity Measure : evaluate the effectiveness of tumescent anesthesia compared to the control group in pain management during a dynamic vertex phototherapy session performed for the management of actinic keratoses., Score of the maximum numerical pain assessment scale from 0 to 10 (0=no pain; 10= pain as bas as can be) felt during the dynamic phototherapy session in both groups.

This score will be collected at the end of the session., 8 minutes
