Full-Course Immunotherapy Consolidation for Unfit or Fit B-ALL Who Decline Chemotherapy
This trial is a non-blinded, single-center, open-label, single-arm clinical study to investigate a full-course immunotherapy regimen in Unfit or Fit B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) patients who decline chemotherapy (Fit-Decline). The trial aims to explore the efficacy and safety of sequential blinatumomab and inotuzumab ozogamicin therapy. The primary endpoint is overall survival (OS), while secondary endpoints include complete remission rate(CRR)、Objective Response Rate(ORR)、Event-free survival(EFS)、Relapse-free survival(RFS)、Cumulative incidence of relapse(CIR)、Non-relapse mortality(NRM) and safety.

DRUG: Full-Course Immunotherapy
Overall Survival(OS), It is measured from the date of entry into this trial to the date of death from any cause; patients not known to have died at last follow-up are censored on the date they were last known to be alive., 2 years
CR rate(CRR), CR rate (CR defined as bone marrow blasts \< 5% and no Auer rods, absence of extramedullary disease, ANC ≥ 1.0 × 109/L \[1000/µL\], platelet count ≥ 100 × 109/L \[100,000/µL\], and independence of RBC transfusions)., 2 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the rate of CR, CRi (including complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery \[CRp\], PR, and MLFS., 2 years|Event-free survival(EFS), Event-free survival (EFS) is defined as the time from the start of treatment until treatment failure, relapse from remission, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., 2 years|Relapse-free survival(RFS), Relapse-free survival(RFS) is the time from achievement of complete remission (CR) to the first documented relapse or death from any cause. Patients who die without evidence of relapse are typically censored at the last disease-free assessment., 2 years|Cumulative incidence of relapse(CIR), It is measured the date from complete remission to hematological relapse or molecular relapse was recorded. Patients who had no relapse at the last follow-up were considered as censored data, and non-relapse death was regarded as a competing risk event., 2 years|Non-relapse mortality(NRM), It is measured the probability of death attributable to treatment-related complications or comorbidities, excluding disease relapse/progression., 2 years
