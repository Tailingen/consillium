Evaluation of Vertebroplasty Associated With Radiotherapy for Spine Metastases (EVAR)
A randomized phase III study of palliative external beam radiotherapy (RTOG 97-14) has shown that 8 Gy in a single fraction is very effective in providing pain relief, with complete or partial improvement in pain seen in 66% of patients with bone metastases. Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PV) is a technique designed to consolidate pathologic vertebral bodies through the injection of orthopaedic cement under fluoroscopic guidance. Consolidation provides rapid pain relief to painful vertebral body lesions secondary to osteoporosis, haemangiomas, myeloma and metastatic diseases, with complete or partial improvement in pain seen in 70-85% of patients. To date, no randomized trial has tested the association of vertebroplasty and radiotherapy to enhance pain relief for patients with painful osseous spine metastases.

A randomized trial has been designed to determine whether vertebroplasty and radiotherapy (8 Gy in a single fraction) provide enhancement pain and narcotic relief compared to radiotherapy alone for patients with painful osseous spine metastases
Osseous Spine Metastases
PROCEDURE: injection of orthopaedic cement into vertebral bodies
Evaluation of pain relief with the Brief Pain Index (BPI), by a blind arm trial algologist, 3 months after radiotherapy., 3 months after radiotherapy|Response will be scored as complete (no pain), partial (improvement of < 2 points in BPI), stable (+/- 1 point change in BPI) or progressive (> 2 point worsening of BPI)., during the study|Complete and partial responses will be considered treatment success, and stable and progressive responses will be considered treatment failures, during the study
Evaluation of pain relief one month after radiotherapy, one month after radiotherapy|BPI-SF and EORTC QLQ-C30 will be used to assess general cancer quality of life., during the study|The incidence of vertebral pathologic fracture will be registered., one month after radiotherapy
Patients with 1 to 4 painful osseous spine metastases are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms:

* Arm 1: 8 Gy in a single fraction
* Arm 2: 8 Gy in a single fraction followed by vertebroplasty of the vertebral bodies, within 14 days after radiotherapy
