Study to Evaluate IMGS-001 Treatment in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of this Phase 1a/1b clinical trial is to test the safety of an investigational drug called IMGS-001 and to determine how well it can work in treating patients with advanced solid tumors that have come back or are not improving after receiving other drugs that are commonly used for their cancer. Phase 1a (Part 1) will test the safety of five different doses of IMGS-001 to use in further studies. Patients with cancer that have advanced or spread to other parts of the body following treatment with other available therapies will be treated in Part 1. Phase 1b (Part 2) will test two doses of IMGS-001 identified in Part 1 to further determine the safety and potential effectiveness in select cancer types.

Part 1 is a Phase 1a, first-in-human, open-label dose-escalation study to determine the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of IMGS-001. The safety, tolerability, PK parameters, and preliminary antitumor activity of IMGS-001 will be assessed in adult patients with advanced solid tumors refractory to appropriate standard of care (SOC) treatments.

Based on the MTD and other information (e.g., tolerability, PK, PD, target engagement), two doses of IMGS-001 will be selected for further evaluation. Additional subjects will be backfilled until at least 10 evaluable subjects have been treated with each of these doses. Approximately 25 total subjects will be enrolled in Phase 1a.

Part 2 is a Phase 1b, open-label, dose-expansion study of five prespecified tumor cohorts to assess preliminary antitumor activity of IMGS-001 in patients that are refractory or intolerant to other appropriate prior standard therapies. Eligible patients must have confirmed PD-L1 expression. To meet PD-L1 expression eligibility in Phase 1b, patients must have confirmed PD-L1 expression (combined positive score (CPS) ≥ 5 or tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥ 5%). Initially, up to 10 subjects in each of the following cohorts will be treated:

Cohort 1: Ovarian cancer; Cohort 2: Colorectal cancer; Cohort 3: Triple-negative breast cancer; Cohort 4: Bladder cancer; Cohort 5: Gastric or esophageal cancer (gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) or esophageal adenocarcinoma).

Each cohort will be assessed to meet efficacy criteria to continue into a randomized dose-optimization. Within each cohort that meets prespecified efficacy criteria, the expanded cohorts will have randomly assigned (1:1) subjects to receive one of two doses used in the Phase 1a. Within each Arm, 20 eligible subjects will be treated with the assigned dose of IMGS-001.
