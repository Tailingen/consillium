Microsampling Approach for Monitoring of Kinase Inhibitor Targeted Therapies
The MISTIK project aims at clinically validating the technique of oral anticancer drugs determination by volumetric absorptive micro-sampling and at comparing the results to measurements performed on venous samples.
Blood Concentrations of Nine Anti-cancer Drugs : Axitinib, Olaparib, regorafénib, Cabozantinib, Niraparib, Talazoparib, Palbociclib, Abemaciclib, Tucatinib
OTHER: Measurement of drug concentrations
Comparison of venous blood vs VAMS concentrations, Comparison of drug concentrations measured from the venous blood samples with concentrations measured from VAMS, 1 day
The International recommendations for the validation of DBS-based methods will be applied (Capiau et al, TDM, 2019) by including 40 patients per molecule of interest. Nine drugs will be monitored : axitinib, olaparib, regorafénib, cabozantinib, niraparib, talazoparib, palbociclib, abemaciclib, tucatinib.

Two samples will be collected from each patient, one by venous sampling and the second at the same time (approximately) using a capillary blood sample derived from a finger prick.
