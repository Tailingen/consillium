Arsenic Trioxide in Relapsed/Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma
Additional active agents are needed to further improve the treatment of patients with CLL/SLL. Increasing information exists regarding the activity of arsenic trioxide in other hematologic malignancies. Since arsenic trioxide produces mild to moderate myelosuppression and is not as immunosuppressive as other available agents, it may be an additional treatment option for CLL/SLL. This study will evaluate the feasibility and toxicity of arsenic trioxide in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL
