Tirapazamine Plus Cisplatin in Treating Patients With Persistent or Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial or Primary Peritoneal Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining tirapazamine with cisplatin in treating patients who have recurrent ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cancer.
Ovarian Cancer|Primary Peritoneal Cavity Cancer
DRUG: cisplatin|DRUG: tirapazamine
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the antitumor activity of tirapazamine and cisplatin in patients with persistent or recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal carcinoma.
* Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive tirapazamine IV over 2 hours followed 1 hour later by cisplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-65 patients will be accrued for this study.
