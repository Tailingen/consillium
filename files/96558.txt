Resection Observatory
Primary Objective:

-Evaluate the resection rate (R0/R1) in current practice for aflibercept in combination with irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil (FOLFIRI) in patients treated for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) after failure of an oxaliplatin-containing regimen

Secondary Objectives:

* Evaluate overall survival, progression-free survival and relapse-free survival.
* Evaluate conversion rates (initially unresectable disease which became resectable after chemotherapy, with R0/R1 resection).
* Evaluate histological and radiological response rates.
* Evaluate rate of postoperative complications.
* Evaluate safety.
