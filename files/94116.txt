Biomarkers of Stage III Locally Advanced Unresectable Non-small-cell Lung Cancer
This study aims to dynamically monitor the expression profile status of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and the changes in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) levels in patients with stage III locally advanced unresectable non-small-cell lung cancer(NSCLC) after concurrent chemoradiotherapy or sequential chemoradiotherapy, and to explore biomarkers related to the immune microenvironment and the optimal time point for immunotherapy after chemoradiotherapy.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Stage III
GENETIC: biomarker detection
Biomarkers associated with immune efficacy, According to the biomarker detection before and after chemoradiotherapy to identify biomarkers related to the immune microenvironment, including the expression levels of NK cells, T cells, B cells and other immune cells reflected by PBMC, as well as the expression levels of ctDNA, up to 2 years|Optimal time for immunotherapy, Changes in the expression levels of ctDNA and PBMC immune cells before and after chemoradiotherapy to find the optimal time point for immunotherapy, up to 2 years
