Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Biodistribution and Anti Tumour Activity of 177LU-OPS201 With Companion Imaging 68Ga-OPS202 PET/CT in Previously Treated Subjects With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Cancers Expressing Somatostatin Receptor 2 (SSTR2)
This study consists of two phases. The phase I study is designed to investigate the safety and tolerability of Satoreotide tetraxetan following fractionated i.v. administrations in pre-treated subjects with locally advanced or metastatic cancers expressing sstr2 as identified by Satoreotide trizoxetan Positron Emission Tomography (PET/CT) scans. This phase will encompass both radioactivity escalation and peptide mass dose evaluation. Phase II will assess the efficacy of Satoreotide tetraxetan in subjects in selected indications, in a basket design.
Small Cell Lung Cancer and Breast Cancer
DRUG: Satoreotide tetraxetan|DRUG: Satoreotide trizoxetan
Maximum Tolerated Cumulative Activity - Phase I, From Day 1 (first administration of 177Lu-satoreotide tetraxetan) up to 6 weeks after the second administration; no longer applicable due to early study termination.|Objective Response Rate Over the Two Treatment Cycles - Phase II, 6 weeks after each administration of 177Lu-satoreotide tetraxetan during the core study or at occurrence of first clinical signs of disease progression as determined by the investigator, up to 90 days; no longer applicable due to early study termination.
