This study will evaluate DS-1062a 6.0 mg/kg vs docetaxel 75 mg/m\^2 in participants with advanced or metastatic NSCLC with or without actionable genomic alterations (AGAs). Participants without actionable genomic alterations must have been previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy and α (anti)-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/α-programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) monoclonal antibody, either in combination or sequentially. Participants with AGA must have progressed on or after 1 platinum-containing therapy and 1 to 2 prior lines of approved targeted therapy for the applicable genomic alteration. The study will be divided into 3 periods: Screening Period, Treatment Period, and Follow-up Period.
