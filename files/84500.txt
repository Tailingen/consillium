Study of Vismodegib in Advanced Gastric Adenocarcinoma Patients With SMO Overexpression
There is no accepted standard therapy for patients with advanced gastric cancer who have progressed during or after second-line therapy. The role of 3rd line treatment in advanced gastric cancer has not been proven.

As a novel target of gastric cancer, SMO overexpression is chosen in this study, and the investigators plan this study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vismodegib in gastric cancer. The doses of vismodegib are based on trials of basal cell carcinoma.
