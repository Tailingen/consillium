Sequential CAR-T Cells Targeting CD33/CD123 in Patients With Acute Myelocytic Leukemia AML
This is an open, single-arm, clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of chimeric antigen receptor T cell immunotherapy (CAR-T) targeting CD33 or CD123 or both sequentially in the treatment of Acute Myelocytic Leukemia.
AML|Acute Myeloid Leukemia|AML, Adult Recurrent|AML, Adult
BIOLOGICAL: CD123/CD33 CART
Incidence and severity of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) following chemotherapy preparative regimen and infusion of CD5/CD7 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, Will be recorded and graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03 at three dose levels until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined., 28 days
Rate of successful manufacture and expansion of the CD33/123 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, satisfy the targeted dose level and meet the required release specifications outlined in the Certificate of Analysis (COA), 10-14 days
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T cells targeted against CD19 have demonstrated unprecedented successes in treating patients with hematopoietic and lymphoid malignancies. Besides CD19, many other molecules such as CD22, CD30,BCMA,CD123, etc. may have the potential to develop the corresponding CAR-T cells to treat patients whose tumors express those markers. In this study, investigators will evaluate the safety and efficacy of CAR-T targeting CD33/CD123 in patients with Acute Myelocytic Leukemia. The primary goal is safety assessment including cytokine storm response and any other adverse effects. In addition, disease status after treatment will also be evaluated.

The purpose of this clinical trial is to assess the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of multiple CAR T-cell therapy which combines CAR T cells against AML Cells with CAR T cells targeting CD123 or CD33 in patients with relapsed and refractory AML. The study also aims to learn more about the function of CAR T cells and their persistence in AML patients.
