Neoadjuvant Weekly Paclitaxel and Biomarkers of Therapy Response
The hypothesis of this study is that paclitaxel levels increase chromosomal instability (CIN) in tumors and this is lethal to tumors that have pre-existing CIN. Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis. Paclitaxel will be initiated as standard infusions on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 21-day cycle. Participants will continue with paclitaxel for cycles 2-4 prior to surgery.
Breast Neoplasm Female
DRUG: Paclitaxel
Response to Paclitaxel, To test if high cancers with high chromosomal instability (CIN) respond to paclitaxel better than low CIN cancers. Response determined by the percent decrease in linear measurement of tumor size on the greatest dimension per RECIST-like criteria, Up to 3 months
Tumor Level Difference of Paclitaxel, Identify patient-specific differences in tumor levels of paclitaxel at 20 hours after first dose.

This is measured by high-performance liquid chromatography of tumor and plasma samples and comparing variability between patients with descriptive statistics., Up to 1 day|Non-Tumor Level Difference of Paclitaxel, Identify patient-specific differences in non-tumor (plasma) levels of paclitaxel at 20 hours after first dose.

This is measured by high-performance liquid chromatography of tumor and plasma samples and comparing variability between patients with descriptive statistics., Up to 1 day|Paclitaxel Levels, Paclitaxel levels at the first dose, 20 hours after the 3rd dose, and 20 hours after the 12th dose. This is measured by high-performance liquid chromatography of tumor and plasma samples and comparing difference at two time points within the same patient with paired statistics., Up to 79 days|Antimitotic Effects, Compare pre-existing versus post-treatment antimitotic effects at 20 hours after the 1st dose, 20 hours after the 3rd dose, and 20 hours after the 12th dose.

This is measured by tissue analysis of tumor samples with phospho-histone H3 and stains for spindle morphology to quantify mitotic index and mitotic characteristics at two time points using paired statistical analysis., Up to 79 days|Mitotic Index, The mitotic index is a measure of cells arresting in mitosis, previously thought to be the major mechanism of taxol action. It is defined as the percentage of cells undergoing mitosis in a given population of cells. An elevated mitotic index indicates more cells are at this phase of the cell cycle at the time of sampling., Baseline and 20 hours post-first dose|Correlate Drug Levels With Aneuploidy of Tumor, Correlate pathologic response and clinical response with biomarkers including aneuploidy, Up to 3 months|Correlate Drug Levels With Chromosomal Instability of Tumor, Correlate pathologic response and clinical response with biomarkers including CIN, Up to 3 months|Ki67 of Tumor, The Ki-67 protein is a cellular marker for proliferation. Ki-67 is an excellent marker to determine the growth fraction of a given cell population. The fraction of Ki-67-positive tumor cells (the Ki-67 labeling index) is often correlated with the clinical course of cancer., Up to 3 months|Change in CIN Levels, There are many proposed ways to measure CIN. Here, we used # of multipolar spindles as a surrogate of CIN measures., Baseline and 20 hours post-first dose
Primary Objectives

* To test if cancers with high chromosomal instability (CIN) respond to paclitaxel better than low CIN cancers.

Secondary Objectives

* To identify patient-specific differences in tumor levels and distribution of paclitaxel at 20 hours after first dose and patient-specific differences in peripheral non-tumor tissue (skin or plasma) paclitaxel levels 20 Â± 4 hours after first dose.
* To determine if paclitaxel levels are higher at 20h after the 3rd dose than after the first dose, and if levels are higher at 20h after the 10th, 11th, or 12th dose than the 1st and 3rd dose.
* Compare pre-existing versus post-treatment antimitotic effects at 20h after the 1st dose, 20h after the 3rd dose, and 20h after the 10th, 11th, or 12th dose.
* Correlate drug levels and distribution with biomarkers including mitotic index, aneuploidy, chromosomal instability, and Ki67.
* Correlate pathologic response and clinical response with biomarkers including mitotic index, aneuploidy, CIN and Ki67.
* To test if CIN increases in patient tumors in response to paclitaxel and to evaluate the feasibility of these measurements by genomic analysis.
