The MASTER Study (MAmmary Cancer STatin ER Positive Study)
Given the compelling evidence supporting a protective effect of statins on breast cancer recurrence, calls for prospective clinical trials have been expressed. In this trial - the MASTER trial - we hypothesize that the addition of statin treatment to the current breast cancer treatment will improve the prognosis of women with early breast cancer. This trial is designed as follows: a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled comparison of standard (neo)adjuvant therapy plus placebo versus standard (neo)adjuvant therapy plus atorvastatin in patients with early breast cancer.
Breast Cancer Female|Estrogen Receptor Positive Tumor
DRUG: Atorvastatin 80 Mg Oral Tablet|DRUG: Placebo oral tablet
Invasive disease-free survival, Invasive disease-free survival (IDFS), defined as the time from randomization until the date of the first occurrence of one of the following events:

* Ipsilateral invasive breast tumor recurrence: invasive breast cancer involving the same breast parenchyma as the original primary.
* Regional invasive breast cancer recurrence: Invasive breast cancer in the axilla, regional lymph nodes, chest wall, and skin of the ipsilateral breast.
* Distant recurrence: Metastatic disease-breast cancer that has either been biopsy confirmed or clinically diagnosed as recurrent invasive breast cancer.
* Death attributable to any cause, including breast cancer, non-breast cancer, or unknown cause.
* Contralateral invasive breast cancer.
* Second primary non-breast invasive cancer., 10 years
Distant-recurrence free interval, Distant-recurrence free interval defined as time from inclusion to first distant recurrence including associations with first site of recurrence., 10 years|Recurrence-free interval, Recurrence-free interval including associations with first site of recurrence, 10 years|Overall survival., Overall survival., 10 years|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events as assessed by CTC-AE, 5.0, Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events as assessed by CTC-AE, 5.0, 10 years|Cardiac death-free interval, Cardiac death-free interval. Cardiac death is defined as:

1. Definitive cardiac death due to heart failure, myocardial infarction or documented primary arrhythmia.
2. Probable cardiac death: Probable cardiac death defined as sudden, unexpected death within 24 hours of a definite or probable cardiac event (e.g., syncope, cardiac arrest, chest pain, infarction, arrhythmia) without documented etiology., 10 years|Co-morbidity, Co-morbidity incidence beyond cardiovascular events during follow-up including diagnoses such as diabetes mellitus., 10 years
Cholesterol-lowering drugs such as statins are currently used to lower cholesterol levels and prevent cardiovascular events. Statins have, however, received substantial scientific attention as cancer-inhibiting drugs. Previous findings were recently supported in a large-scaled study again demonstrating the beneficial effects of statins on breast cancer outcome this time nested within a large, international, randomized clinical trial of modern adjuvant cancer therapy. Given the compelling evidence supporting a protective effect of statins on breast cancer recurrence, calls for prospective clinical trials have been expressed. In this trial - the MASTER trial - we hypothesize that the addition of statin treatment to the current breast cancer treatment will improve the prognosis of women with early breast cancer. Thus, the primary objective of the MASTER trial is to determine the clinical efficacy of the statin - atorvastatin - as measured by invasive disease-free survival among patients with primary breast cancer.

The trial is nationwide throughout Denmark and a total of 3,360 women are to be included in the trial. Women eligible for the trial have been diagnosed with an estrogen receptor positive breast cancer and are candidates for systemic cancer therapy, either prior to or following breast surgery. Upon eligibility and signed informed consent, trial participants will be randomized in a 1:1 manner to either standard treatment and atorvastatin 80 mg/day or standard treatment and placebo. The randomization is blinded. The treatment with atorvastatin or placebo will continue for two years unless side effects are experienced and further treatment with atorvastatin or the placebo is deemed inadequate. The standard treatment will of course continue as planned. The trial participants will follow the standard clinical routines in terms of follow-up and in addition they are asked to fill in questionnaires, i.e. regarding potential side effects or new events or diagnoses, up to ten years following inclusion. Potential breast cancer recurrences are hereby identified and a follow-up of at least 61/2 years will be required for the trial the demonstrate the estimated clinical difference between the randomized groups of patients.
