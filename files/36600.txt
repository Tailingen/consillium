Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of Idelalisib in Adults Receiving Ruxolitinib as Therapy for Primary, Post-Polycythemia Vera, or Post-Essential Thrombocythemia Myelofibrosis With Progressive or Relapsed Disease
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of idelalisib in adults receiving ruxolitinib as therapy for intermediate to high-risk primary myelofibrosis (PMF), post-polycythemia vera, or post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis (post-PV MF or post-ET MF) with progressive or relapsed disease.

This is a dose-escalation study. There will be 4 cohorts (A, B, C, D). Participants will receive an escalating dose or dose frequency of idelalisib based on the safety data of available cohort(s).
Myelofibrosis
DRUG: Idelalisib|DRUG: Ruxolitinib
Percentage of Participants Experiencing Any Treatment Emergent Adverse Events Within 28 Days of Idelalisib Exposure, First dose date up to 28 days|Percentage of Participants Experiencing Adverse Events Related to Idelalisib Within 28 Days of Idelalisib Exposure, First dose date up to 28 days|Percentage of Participants Experiencing Treatment-Emergent Laboratory Abnormalities Within 28 Days of Idelalisib Exposure by Worst Grade at Postbaseline, Treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities were defined as values that increase at least one toxicity grade from baseline. The most severe graded abnormality from all tests was counted for each participant. Treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities were graded per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.03 where 1=Mild, 2=Moderate, 3=Severe, 4=Potentially Life Threatening., First dose date up to 28 days|Percentage of Participants Who Permanently Discontinued Idelalisib Due to an Adverse Event Within 28 Days of Idelalisib Exposure, First dose date up to 28 days
Percentage of Participants Experiencing Treatment Emergent Adverse Events Beyond 28 Days of Idelalisib Exposure, First dose date up to the last dose date (maximum:15.1 months) plus 30 days|Percentage of Participants Experiencing Adverse Events Related to Idelalisib Beyond 28 Days of Idelalisib Exposure, First dose date up to the last dose date (maximum:15.1 months) plus 30 days|Percentage of Participants Experiencing Abnormal Laboratory Abnormalities Beyond 28 Days of Idelalisib Exposure by Worst Grade at Postbaseline, Treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities were defined as values that increase at least one toxicity grade from baseline. The most severe graded abnormality from all tests was counted for each participant. Treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities were graded per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.03 where 1=Mild, 2=Moderate, 3=Severe, 4=Potentially Life Threatening., First dose date up to the last dose date (maximum:15.1 months) plus 30 days|Percentage of Participants Who Permanently Discontinued Idelalisib Due to an Adverse Event Beyond 28 Days of Exposure, First dose date up to the last dose date (maximum:15.1 months) plus 30 days|Rate of Overall Response, Rate of overall response as defined by 2013 Revised International Working Group for Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research and Treatment (IWG-MRT) and European Leukemia Net (ELN) response criteria., Start of treatment to end of treatment ( up to 15.1 months)|Plasma Concentration of Idelalisib and GS-563117 (Idelalisib Metabolite), Predose Week 2, 1.5 hour Week 2, and Predose Week 3
