A Study to Prospectively Validate Blood Markers Associated With Differences in Efficacy of Neoadjuvant Therapy for NSCLC
This study utilized a prospective cohort design. It is proposed to analyze the serum of NSCLC patients treated with chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy, and chemotherapy alone, starting from liquid biopsy technique and combining with proteomic methods. By comparing the differences in serum proteins between the two groups of patients before treatment, we will validate the targets related to efficacy and AE events identified in a previous retrospective study, further explore their associations with patients' clinical outcomes and AE events, and establish a clinical prediction model to guide and improve the current treatment of NSCLC.
