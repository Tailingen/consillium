Register Study of Patients With Peritoneal Carcinomatosis Treated With PIPAC (Pressurized Intra-peritoneal Aerosol-Chemotherapy)
The study will follow up patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis from colorectal, ovarian, gastric, pancreatic cancers and primary peritoneal tumors and undergoing a diagnostic laparoscopy / laparotomy, a PIPAC as single dose or repeated every 6 weeks. The Overall Response Rate (ORR), the Overall Survival (OS) and the Quality of Life will be assessed before every PIPAC. Biopsies of the peritoneal carcinomatosis and blood (plasma and serum) are collected with every PIPAC intervention to follow up and to document the individual success or progress of the patients. The advice of the tumor board is mandatory to confirm the indication for local chemotherapy (PIPAC).
