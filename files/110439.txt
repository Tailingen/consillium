Comparison Between Robotic, Endoscopic and Traditional Open Surgery in Thyroidectomy
Comparison of endoscopic thyroidectomy, robotic thyroidectomy and conventional open surgery, the safety of the operation, the timing of the operation and the complications.
Endoscopy|Robotics|Thyroidectomy|Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: conventional open surgery|PROCEDURE: endoscopic thyroidectomy|DEVICE: robotic thyroidectomy
operation time, Assess the operation time, The first day after surgery|recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy, the number of recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy, 2 months post operation
thyroid volume, thyroid volume, The day before the operation|cosmetic effect, The satisfaction with cosmetic outcomes was analyzed quantitatively using a scoring system that ranged from 1 to 4(1, extremely; 2, fairly; 3, normal; 4: not at all) that was rated by patients at the outpatient clinic 2 months after the operation., 2 months post operation
With the further development of endoscopic technique, thyroid surgery of the robot has emerged, which may become a trend of endoscopic technology due to its convenience and accuracy.In this study, the advantages and disadvantages of endoscopic thyroidectomy and robotic thyroid surgery were compared, and the experience in the transition stage of thyroid surgery in robotic and endoscopic thyroidectomy was summarized.
