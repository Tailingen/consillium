Optical Coherence Tomography in Patients With Radiotherapy for Head and Neck Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine whether any eventual skin damage caused by radiation therapy can be detected and monitored at a subclinical level via optical coherence tomography (OCT). Another key question is whether subclinical OCT detected skin damage correlates with acute and late clinical toxicity.

early radiation induced skin structure changes detected in OCT, any reproducible difference in skin OCT appearance as compared with baseline (pre-RT), First week of radiation therapy
detection of any skin strucure changes with OCT during the course of RT, any reproducible difference in skin OCT appearance as compared with baseline (pre-RT), weeks 1 - 6 of radiation therapy|Correlation of OCT changes with clinical appearent acute side effetcs, Correlation of OCT changes with CTC radiation toxicity, weeks 1 - 6 of radiation therapy|Correlation of OCT changes with clinical appearent late side effetcs, Correlation of OCT changes with CTC radiation toxicity, 1 year post-RT|Correlation of OCT changes with radiation sensitivity, Correlation of OCT with chromosome-breaks per metaphasis in in-vitro irradiated blood lymphocytes (FISH), OCT: weeks 1-6 of radiation therapy; FISH: pre-RT|Correlation of OCT changes with dermatoscopic skin appearance, Correlation of OCT changes with standardised evaluated skin appearence via dermatoscopy, weeks 1-6 of RT|Correlation of quality of live with OCT and radiation sensitivity, Correlation of quality of live as measured with the EORT QLC C30 and Head and neck module H\&N 43 with OCT and radiation sensitivity, weeks 1-6 of RT, 6 weeks and 1 year post-RT
Head and neck cancer patients that meet the eligibility criteria and singned the informed consent will undergo OCT-measurements before, during and after the course of radiation therapy. At the same time-points the skin areas are evaluated with dermatoscopy and patients are asked to self-assess their quality of life (EORTC QLQ C30 and respective head and neck module H\&N 43). Before the onset of radiation therapy radiation sensitivity analysis will be performed with in-vitro irradion of peripheral blood lymphocytes (FISH).
