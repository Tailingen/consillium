Yttrium-90 Radioembolization With Glass Microspheres (TheraSphere) for Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This is a prospective pilot study that will document the clinical experience of 30 patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma undergoing liver-directed therapy with Yttrium-90 glass microspheres (TheraSphere®).
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DEVICE: Selective internal radiation therapy of the liver with Yttrium-90 glass microspheres (TheraSphere)
Number of Participants With Adverse Events, Adverse events of treatment with TheraSphere Yttrium-90 glass microspheres will be assessed within 6 months of treatment administration. Anticipated adverse events may include liver dysfunction, gastrointestinal ulcer formation, cholecystitis, pneumonitis, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, 6 months
Radiographic Response by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1, Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) as assessed by MRI or CT:

up to 5 lesions at baseline and sum longest diameters (SLD).

* Complete Response (CR), -Target Lesions: Disappearance of all target lesions.

  -Non-target Lesions: disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level.
* Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions;
* Stable Disease (SD) \< %30 decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions.
* Progressive Disease (PD) -Target Lesions: \> 20% increase in the SLD taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded since the treatment started (nadir) and minimum 5 mm increase over the nadir

non-target lesions: Overall level of substantial worsening in non-target disease such that, even in presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy, 6 months
