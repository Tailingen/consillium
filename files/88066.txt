Trastuzumab Beyond Progression in HER2 Positive Metastatic Gastric Cancer
The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination therapy with ramucirumab, paclitaxel, and trastuzumab biosimilar as second line treatment of HER2 positive metastatic gastric cancer after failure of first line chemotherapy including trastuzumab. This study is a phase II, single-arm, open label, multi-center study.
Gastric Cancer
DRUG: Trastuzumab|DRUG: Ramucirumab|DRUG: Paclitaxel
Progression free survival, PFS, as measured from the start of the treatment to the date of either documentation of disease progression or death, up to 12 months
Objective response rate, ORR, defined as the proportion of subjects who have a best overall response of complete response or partial response as assessed by RECIST 1.1, up to 6 months|Overall survival, OS, defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, up to 12 months|Adverse event, as measured by NCI-CTCAE v5.0, up to 12 months
Approximately 15% of patients with advanced gastric cancer have HER2 overexpression and the combined use of trastuzumab and other cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, such as 5-FU and cisplatin, in these patients is associated with a significantly improved survival rate compared with cytotoxic chemotherapy alone. So, the combination of trastuzumab and chemotherapy is currently being used as a standard treatment in HER2 positive advanced gastric or gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma. However, after failing first line treatment with such regimen, second line treatment is determined regardless of HER2 status, and the most preferred treatment is ramucirumab and paclitaxel combination chemotherapy.

Recently, the use of trastuzumab in combination with other cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents has been reported to be superior to the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy alone in the treatment of patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer. On the basis of several guidelines, it is recommended to extend the use of trastuzumab after disease progression. In addition, in some retrospective studies of metastatic gastric cancer, it has been reported that treatment with trastuzumab in combination with second line chemotherapy followed by first line chemotherapy including trastuzumab is beneficial and it is worthwhile to be tested in the prospective study. Furthermore, data on the safety and efficacy of cross-administration of trastuzumab biosimilar have not been available yet.
