Dexmedetomidine Infusion Effect on Hemodynamic Variables During Craniotomy
There is no clear consensus among neuroanesthesiologists regarding which anesthetic regimen is optimal for craniotomy. Propofol and short-acting opioids (such as remifentanil, fentanyl, or sufentanil) are commonly used. However, use of opioids is associated with increased risk of respiratory depression and postoperative nausea and vomiting. Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective α2-adrenoreceptor agonist that has been considered as a useful and safe adjunct to anesthesia for various surgical procedures
Hemodynamic Instability|Supratentorial Neoplasms
DRUG: Dexmedetomidine|DRUG: normal saline
Mean areterial blood pressure, incidence of intraoperative hemodynamic stability, 4 to 8 hours|Heart rate, incidence of intraoperative hemodynamic stability, 4 to 8 hours|Number of Participants needed rescue agents, 4 to 8 hours
Recovery time in minutes, Recovery time in minutes (time interval between discontinuation of isoflurane and extubation)., At the end of operation|Postoperative sedation level, Assessment of postoperative sedation level using "University of Michigan Sedation Scale (UMSS)" The UMSS is a simple observational tool that assesses the level of alertness on a five-point scale ranging from 1 (wide awake) to 5 (unarousable with deep stimulation). Score: 1- 5, 1st 2 hours postoperatively
The investigators designed this randomized, double-blind study to evaluate the effectiveness of administration of Dexmedetomidine infusion at a dose of 0.5 µg/kg/h without loading dose during elective supratentorial craniotomy under GA. The investigators will compare intraoperative hemodynamics in both groups, intraoperative analgesic consumption, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative sedation scores, intraoperative need for rescue hypotensive agents, and finally the satisfaction of surgeons.

To our knowledge, the present study is the first to evaluate the effect of Dexmedetomidine infusion without loading dose in elective supratentorial craniotomy
