Pre-operative Chemotherapy Versus Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy in N2 Positive IIIA Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
It is suggested that a bimodal or trimodal approach combining neoadjuvant chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy followed by surgery provides a potentially superior method of enhancing resectability and improving locoregional control and survival compared to radiotherapy alone followed by surgery. Unsolved questions are the identification of the best induction strategy, the impact of surgery on long-term survival, and the contribution of radiation therapy in this setting. Thus, the investigators conduct a phase II trial to compare neoadjuvant chemotherapy with concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with biopsy proven N2 stage IIIA NSCLC to address optimal induction strategy.
