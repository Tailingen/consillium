Alterations of Gut Microbiome, Function, and Its Intervention After Defunctioning Ileostomy
This study focused on the alterations of gut microbiome and function during defunctioning ileostomy, and observed the effects of probiotic intervention on intestinal microbiome and function. The investigators looked forward to find the specific intestinal maladjusted flora from this work, which could provide a new scheme for the subsequent treatment of the damaged intestinal function and the reduction of the incidence of postoperative complication.
