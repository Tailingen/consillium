A Study to Determine Dose, Safety, Tolerability, Drug Levels, and Efficacy of CC-220 Monotherapy, and in Combination With Other Treatments in Participants With Multiple Myeloma
This is a multicenter, multi-country, open-label, Phase 1b/2a dose-escalation study consisting of two parts: dose escalation (Part 1) for CC-220 monotherapy, CC-220 in combination with DEX, CC-220 in combination with DEX and DARA, CC-220 in combination with DEX and BTZ and CC-220 in combination with DEX and CFZ; and the expansion of the RP2D (Part 2) for CC-220 monotherapy and CC-220 in combination with DEX for Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma (RRMM), CC-220 in combination with DEX and BTZ, and CC-220 in combination with DEX and DARA for Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma (NDMM).

Establish maximum tolerated doses (MTDs) of CC-220 as monotherapy and in combination with other treatment, Establish the maximum tolerated doses (MTDs) of CC-220 monotherapy, in combination with DEX, and in combination with DEX and daratumumab (CC-220Dd), in combination with DEX and bortezomib (CC-220Vd), and in combination with DEX and carfilzomib (CC-220Kd), Approximately 3 years|Establish Recommended Phase 2 doses (RP2Ds) of CC-220 as monotherapy and in combination with other treatment, RP2D is defined as the dose selected for phase 2 based on safety, pharmacokinetics and biomarker data from phase 1 of the study, Approximately 3 years|Overall response rate (ORR) of CC-220 in combination with Dexamethasone (DEX) in Cohort D, Tumor response, including progressive disease (PD) according to the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Uniform Response Criteria (Kumar, 2011) in CC-220 in combination with DEX, Approximately 5 years

Subjects assigned to CC-220 monotherapy, who develop progressive disease (PD) will have the option to receive DEX in addition to CC-220 after consultation with the Medical Monitor. The dose of CC-220 will not be higher than the dose of CC-220 used in combination with dexamethasone in Cohort B that has been determined to be safe. Progressive disease must be confirmed in accordance with international myeloma working group (IMWG) criteria.

For Cohorts A and B, the starting dose level of CC-220, dose level 1, is 0.3 mg. A dose level -1, of 0.15 mg, may also be evaluated if the starting dose level of 0.3 mg for 21 days of a 28-day cycle is not tolerated. For Cohorts E and F, the starting dose level of CC-220, dose level 1, is one dose level below the maximum dose for Cohort B that has been determined to be safe by the dose escalation committee (DEC) at the start of enrollment for both cohorts. For Cohort E in addition to CC-220 and DEX, daratumumab will be administered intravenously (IV) at a 16mg/kg dose. For Cohort F in addition to CC-220 and DEX, bortezomib will be administered subcutaneous (SC) at a 1.3mg/m2 dose.

All subjects who discontinue study treatment in Part 1 or Part 2 of the study for a reason other than PD or withdrawal of consent from the study will be followed for response assessment every 28 days (every 21 days for Cohort F) until PD.

The study will be conducted in compliance with the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use/Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and applicable regulatory requirements.

The initiation of Part 2 will begin when the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) is established in Part 1 in either Cohort A, Cohort B, Cohort E or Cohort F. The cohorts may begin once the RP2D is determined for each cohort independently during Part 1. All expansion decisions will be determined by the DEC after review of all safety, PK, biomarker and preliminary efficacy data, as applicable. During Part 2, the Independent Expert Reviewer will review safety data and any other data deemed relevant so that subject safety is ensured.
