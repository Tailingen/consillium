Comparison of Nodal Staging in Endometrial Cancer
This study aims to estimate the recurrence-free survival rates in women with endometrial cancer treated with selective versus sentinel node surgical staging.
Endometrial Cancer
PROCEDURE: Sentinel node procedure|PROCEDURE: Selective staging
Recurrence-free survival rate, Recurrence-free survival rate in women with endometrial cancer treated with selective versus sentinel node surgical staging, 5 years
Progression-free survival rate, Progress-free survival rate in women with endometrial cancer treated with selective versus sentinel node surgical staging, 5 years|Disease-specific survival rate, Disease-specific survival rate in women with endometrial cancer treated with selective versus sentinel node surgical staging, 5 years|Overall patient survival rate, Overall survival rate in women with endometrial cancer treated with selective versus sentinel node surgical staging, 5 years|Concordance of SELECTIVE and SENTINEL NODE surgical staging with final pathology, Percentage of participants for whom selective surgical staging and final pathology match. Match incorporates grade, lesion size, depth of invasion, and low-risk (no lymphadenectomy) versus high-risk (lymphadenectomy)., 5 years|Patient morbidity, 5 years|Patient mortality, 5 years
