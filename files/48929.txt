Study to Evaluate LB-LR1109 for the Treatment of Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1, first-in-human (FIH), multi-center, open-label, non-randomized, dose escalation study, designed to determine the Maximum tolerated dose(MTD)/Recommended Phase 2 dose(RP2D) of LB-LR1109 and to evaluate safety, tolerability, preliminary efficacy, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, pharmacodynamics of LB-LR1109, and its impact on quality of life in participants with unresectable and metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer(NSCLC), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma(HNSCC), renal cell carcinoma(RCC), urothelial carcinoma, or malignant melanoma and no available standard of care treatment options.
