Trial of Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Gastric Cancer
This is a phase III randomized study designed to evaluate the efficacy of mitomycin, doxifluridine, and cisplatin compared to mitomycin and doxifluridine.
Stomach Cancer
DRUG: Mitomycin, doxifluridine and cisplatin|DRUG: Mitomycin and doxifluridine
Relapse-free Survival Rate, Relapse-free survival at 3 years was defined as the proportion of patients who did not show an evidence of disease recurrence after 3 years of surgery.

Relapse was defined as any new tumor lesion., 3 years
Overall Survival Rate, Overall survival rate at 3 years was defined as the proportion of patients who were alive at 3 years after surgery., 3 years|Number of Patients With Adverse Events, Per National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 2.0, up to 3 years, Up to 3 years
Stomach cancer is the most common cancer in Korea and one of the major health problems worldwide. The most effective treatment for gastric cancer is curative surgical resection of primary tumor. However, a substantial number of patients eventually die of recurrences after curative resection. A number of randomized trials investigating the role of adjuvant chemotherapy have been conducted. However, the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy is still controversial and varied between Western and Asian trials. Meta-analysis of Western trials didn't demonstrate the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy after curative resection. Conversely, some Asian studies have demonstrated the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy after curative resection. In a previous study, mitomycin plus tegafur prolonged the survival in resected gastric cancer compared to no treatment.

This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of mitomycin, cisplatin and prolonged treatment with doxifluridine compared to mitomycin plus doxifluridine.
