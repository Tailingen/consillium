Breast MRI Spectroscopy
The purpose of this study is to provide physicians with additional information not available with standard imaging methods for breast disease.

As part of the MRI examination ordered by your physician, a new method of analyzing the images or pictures will be used. This new method is called spectroscopy and is used routinely on other parts of the body such as the prostate and brain. Pictures produced with this sequence may look slightly different than the regular MRI pictures. Using spectroscopy data, it may be possible to distinguish benign conditions of the breast from malignant tumors and provide more precise information than can be obtained with regular MRI.
Suspicion of, or Known Breast Cancer
OTHER: Radiology/MRI scan
To determine if spectroscopy of the breast can be performed and can be functional in a clinical environment., 12 months
To determine if the data obtained can be reliably analyzed and useful to the final interpretation of the breast MRI examination., 12 months
Our aim is to perform MR Spectroscopy (MRS) on 150 evaluable patients at the end of their routine breast MRI examination using a software package from General Electric Medical Systems Milwaukee, WI). This will add time to the routine examination but will not involve additional injections of contrast. We will analyze the spectroscopic data to determine if benign lesions can be reliably differentiated from malignant ones.
