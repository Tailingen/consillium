VMAT for Dominant Intraprostatic Lesion
The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of the implementation of a program of " image-guided focal Intensification dose to intraprostatic dominant lesion " in men with localized prostate cancer (PCa) of intermediate and high risk (criteria NCCN) eligible to receive radiotherapy in the Department of Radiation Oncology of HUP (Hospital Universitario de La Princesa), within the established dose escalation protocol with intensity modulated image-guided radiotherapy (IMRT / IGRT).

RADIATION: IGRT/VMAT focal therapy boost to DIL
Number of Participants With Biochemical Failure at 5 Years, Biochemical failure determined according to the Phoenix definition (nadir PSA + 2 ng/ml), 5 years|Local Control, An image complete response was defined as disappearance of all morphological and functional lesions in mpMRI 6 to 9 months after radiotherapy., 6 and 9 months following radiotherapy|Acute and Late Rectal and Urinary Complications, Acute and late rectal and urinary complications defined as the number of participants with treatment-related adverse events assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events CTCAE v4.0 and Radiation- Therapy Oncology Group/ European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer RTOG/EORTC scales (been 0: no toxicity and 4: most severe toxicity)., 5 years
Number of Participants Free of Biochemical Progression, Biochemical disease-free survival according to the Phoenix definition (PSA \>2 ng/mL above the currently observed PSA nadir. Defined as the time from enrollment to progression of biochemical disease, or death from any cause, or censoring at the date of the last contact., 5 years|Quality of Life (QoL) Assessed by the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite EPIC16 Scale 0-60 (Best to Worst). The Total Score of the Scale is the Summatory of the Domain's Score, Assessment of the QoL perceived by the patient in the urinary incontinence, urinary abstraction irritation, bowel function, sexual function and vitality/hormone functions domains, 5 years|Disease-free Survival (DFS), Survival free of any event including biochemical failure, local failure, distant metastasis or death, 5 years|Verification of Safety Margins, Quantification of the systematic and random errors during the preparation and administration of the radiotherapy treatment in 15 patients. Security margins estimation according to Van Herk formula, 5 years
