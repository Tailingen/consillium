Chromosomal Damage in Type 2 Diabetes Patients (MIKRODIAB)
The purpose of the study is to determine whether glycemic control (HbA1c) is linked to chromosomal damage in type 2 Diabetes patients
Type 2 Diabetes|Cancer
The quality of HbA1c influences micronuclei formation in binucleated cells, In this cross-sectional study the micronuclei formation in binucleated lymphocytes (Number of micronuclei/1000 binucleated cells) is compared between a low (HbA1c\<7.5%) and a high (HbA1c\>7.5%) glycemic group, Baseline
Type 2 diabetes duration of the subjects influences chromosomal damage, The micronuclei formation in binucleated lymphocytes (Number of micronuclei/1000 binucleated cells) is associated with the duration of the Typ 2 diabetes disease., Baseline
