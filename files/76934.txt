Phase 1b DV281 With an Anti-PD-1 Inhibitor in NSCLC
This open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation and expansion trial is designed to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of inhaled DV281 in combination with nivolumabfor the treatment of NSCLC and to select a recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).
Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: DV281|DEVICE: Breath Actuated Nebulizer|DRUG: DV281 (RP2D)|DRUG: Approved Anti-PD-1 Inhibitor
Dose Escalation, Incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), DLT assessment period - Day 1 through Day 28.|Dose Expansion, Objective response rate (ORR) of dosing regimen established during the Dose Escalation, 1 year after last subject is enrolled in the Dose Expansion phase of study|Dose Expansion, Duration of Response (DOR) and time to response., 1 year after last subject is enrolled in the Dose Expansion phase of the Study
Dose Escalation, Assess IFN-a induced gene expression in blood when DV281 is administered as a monotherapy and in combination with an approved anti-PD-1 inhibitor, IFN response assessment period - Day 1 through Day 21|Dose Expansion, Incidence of treatment related AE's as assessed by CTCAE Version 4.03, 1 year after last subject is enrolled in the Dose Expansion phase of study
Pre-clinical studies support the proposed dosing schema to be tested and a potential benefit of the combination of inhaled DV281 with nivolumab for subjects with advanced NSCLC. This study (DV9-NSC-01) is designed for establishing an immunologically optimal RP2D for inhaled DV281 in combination with an approved anti-PD-1 inhibitor. This trial, studying the potential to enhance the efficacy of an approved anti-PD-1 inhibitor in subjects with advanced NSCLC, addresses an unmet need for NSCLC patients having tumors that do not respond or do not respond adequately to anti-PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy.
