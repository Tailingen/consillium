Goserelin and Letrozole or Anastrozole in Premenopausal Patients With Stage II-III Estrogen Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer
This phase II trial studies the impact of a presurgical endocrine therapy, consisting of goserelin with letrozole or anastrozole on the treatment of premenopausal patients with stage II-III estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer. Endocrine therapy reduces the amount of estrogen in the body. E+ breast cancer require estrogen, so lower levels of estrogen may slow or stop cell growth. Giving goserelin together with letrozole or anastrozole before surgery may enhance the effectiveness of, or eliminate the need for, chemotherapy

Pathologic Complete Response (CR) Rate, * In patients with Ki67 \>10% and \<= 15 pg/ml at 4 weeks.
* The pCR rate for neo-adjuvant chemotherapy is defined as 100 times the number of eligible patients with no histologic evidence of invasive tumor cells in the surgical breast specimen and the axillary or sentinel lymph nodes divided by the total number of eligible patients who received neo-adjuvant chemotherapy., 1 month|Acceptability of Management With Surgical Oophorectomy/Continued LHRH With Continued Oral Endocrine Therapy and no Chemotherapy, Proportion of patients with a PEPI score of 0 and pathological stage 1 who choose to forego chemotherapy., 6 months post neoadjuvant endocrine therapy and surgery
Relationship Between Pretreatment FFNP-PET Standard Uptake Value (SUV) and 4-week Post-treatment Ki-67, Baseline and 4 weeks post-treatment|Preoperative Endocrine Prognostic Index Score (PEPI Score), To obtain the PEPI score, risk points for relapse-free survival (RFS) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) are assigned depending on the hazard ratio (HR) from the multivariable analysis. The total PEPI score assigned to each patient is the sum of the risk points derived from the pT stage, pN stage, Ki67 level, and estrogen receptor status of the surgical specimen. A HR in the range of 1 to 2 receives one risk point; a HR in the 2 to 2.5 range, two risk points; a HR greater than 2.5, three risk points. The total risk point score for each patient is the sum of all the risk points accumulated from the four factors in the model, ranges from 0 (best possible outcome) to 12 (worst possible outcome)., At time of definitive surgery|PEPI-0 Rate in Patients Whose Estradiol is Fully Suppressed (< or = 15 pg/mL) and Tumor Ki67 Level is 10% or Less, 16 weeks
