Incidence of Venous Thromboembolism and Cardiovascular Events in Breast Cancer Patients Undergoing Cyclin-dependent Kinase 4/6 Inhibitors: The Breast Cancer Associated Vascular Events During Cyclin-dependent Kinase 4/6 Inhibitors Therapy (BRAVE-Cyclin) Study
"Incidence of Venous Thromboembolism and Cardiovascular Events in Patients with Breast Cancer Treated with Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitors 4/6, the BRAVE-Cyclin Study" is national, single-center, observational, prospective cohort study, conducted at Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A. Gemelli IRCCS.

According to recent evidence, patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer receiving cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitors - ribociclib, palbociclib, and abemaciclib - may have an increased risk of arterial or venous thrombosis.

Currently, there are no validated tools to stratify breast cancer patients receiving CDK 4/6 inhibitors according to their thromboembolic or cardiovascular risk.

The prospective BRAVE-Cyclin study aims to evaluate the incidence of venous thromboembolism, major cardiovascular events, and major adverse peripheral vascular events in breast cancer patients receiving CDK 4/6 inhibitors.

The objective is to identify the main determinants of thromboembolic and cardiovascular risk, thus improving risk stratification and management strategies.
