Non-Invasive Imaging of [18F]HX4 With Positron-Emission-Tomography (PET)
Non invasive imaging of hypoxia with the aid of PET-scans could help to select the patients having a hypoxic tumour who could be treated with specific anti-hypoxic treatments such as bio-reductive drugs or hypoxic radio-sensitizers. Several 2-nitroimidazoles to which the compound to be tested, HX-4, belongs, labelled with Fluor-18 have already been used in patients. However, bad image quality and unpredictable kinetics limit their use. In extensive pre-clinical models, the combination of HX-4 labelled with Fluor-18 is a promising non-toxic new probe to determine hypoxia.
Cancer
PROCEDURE: Injection of HX-4
Toxicity (CTCAE 3.0), 9 months
Image Quality at different time points (Tumour-to-Background Ratio determined by PET-CT scan), 9 months
To determine the toxicity of the hypoxia PET-tracer \[18F\]-HX4 in cancer patients in two dose-steps:

* Step 1 (3-6 patients): a single dose of maximum 6 mCi (222 MBq) dose of \[18F\]HX4 (which contains a maximum of 15 μg HX-4) via a bolus IV injection.
* Step 2 (3-6 patients): a single dose of maximum 12 mCi (444 MBq) dose of \[18F\]HX4 (which contains a maximum of 27 μg HX-4) via a bolus IV injection.
