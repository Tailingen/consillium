MBCT and CBT for Depression in Patients After Cancer: a Randomized Controlled Trial
The purpose of this study is to determine whether mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) are effective in reducing depressive symptoms in patients after cancer
Depressive Symptoms
BEHAVIORAL: Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT)|BEHAVIORAL: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
Change in severity of depressive symptoms, Severity of depressive symptoms will be assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), pre-treatment (baseline) to post-treatment (approximately 3 months after baseline) and 3- and 9-month follow-up
Change in generalized anxiety, Generalized anxiety is measured by the Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD 7), pre-treatment (baseline) to post-treatment (approximately 3 months after baseline) and 3- and 9-month follow-up|Change in well-being, Well-being is measured by the WHO Well-being Index (WHO-5), pre-treatment (baseline) to post-treatment (approximately 3 months after baseline) and 3- and 9-month follow-up|Change in fear of recurrence, Fear of recurrence will be measured by Concerns About Recurrence Scale (CARS), pre-treatment (baseline) to post-treatment (approximately 3 months after baseline) and 3- and 9-month follow-up|Change in fatigue, Fatigue is measured by the subsequent scale of the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20), pre-treatment (baseline) to post-treatment (approximately 3 months after baseline) and 3- and 9-month follow-up
Cancer patients are prone to develop depressive symptoms, even after curative treatment. Conventional therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) are frequently used for reducing these depressive symptoms in patients with medical conditions. However, until now evidence from proper designed randomized controlled trials regarding the effectiveness of both interventions in cancer survivors, is lacking. Therefore, our longitudinal study aims to investigate the effectiveness of CBT and MBCT in reducing depressive symptoms in cancer survivors. In addition, potential moderators and mediators of each intervention will be explored.
