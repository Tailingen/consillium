A Study of Amivantamab and Lazertinib in Combination With Platinum-Based Chemotherapy Compared With Platinum-Based Chemotherapy in Patients With Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)-Mutated Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non- Small Cell Lung Cancer After Osimertinib Failure
The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of adding lazertinib to amivantamab, carboplatin, and pemetrexed (LACP/ACP-L dosing strategies) and amivantamab, carboplatin and pemetrexed (ACP) compared with carboplatin and pemetrexed (CP) in participants with locally advanced or metastatic epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) Exon 19del or Exon 21 L858R substitution non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after osimertinib failure. The purpose of the extension cohort is to further describe the safety and efficacy for the ACP-L dosing schedule versus ACP with additional data. After completion of the primary analysis, the study may eventually transition to an open-label extension (OLE) or long-term extension (LTE) phase during which participants will have the option to continue their assigned treatment.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
DRUG: Lazertinib|DRUG: Amivantamab|DRUG: Pemetrexed|DRUG: Carboplatin
Main Study: Progression-free Survival (PFS) According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 as Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), PFS is defined as the time from randomization until the date of objective disease progression or death, whichever came first, as assessed by BICR according to RECIST version 1.1. Progressed disease: Sum of diameters increased by greater than or equal to (\>=)20 percent (%) and \>=5 millimeter (mm) from nadir (including baseline if it was smallest sum)., From randomization to either disease progression or death, whichever occurred first (up to 1 year 7 months)|Main Study + Extension Cohort: Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Treatment-emergent Serious Adverse Events (TESAEs), Follow-up for the extension cohort is still ongoing and thus results from the analysis that includes the extension cohort will be reported up on study completion., up to 4 years 10 months|Main Study + Extension Cohort: Progression-free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review, Up to 4 years 10 months
Main Study+ Extension Cohort: Objective Response Rate as Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review, Up to 4 years 10 months|Main Study+ Extension Cohort: Overall Survival, Up to 4 years 10 months|Main Study+ Extension Cohort: Duration of Response as Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review, Up to 4 years 10 months|Main Study+ Extension Cohort: Time to Subsequent Therapy, Up to 4 years 10 months|Main Study+ Extension Cohort: Progression-free Survival (PFS) After First Subsequent Therapy (PFS2), Up to 4 years 10 months|Main Study+ Extension Cohort: Time to Symptomatic Progression, Up to 4 years 10 months|Main Study+ Extension Cohort: Intracranial Progression-free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review, Up to 4 years 10 months|Main Study: Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), Up to 4 years 10 months|Main Study+ Extension Cohort: Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) by Severity, Up to 4 years 10 months|Main Study+ Extension Cohort: Number of Participants With Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities, Up to 4 years 10 months|Main Study+ Extension Cohort: Serum Concentration of Amivantamab, Up to 4 years 10 months|Main Study+ Extension Cohort: Plasma Concentration of Lazertinib, Up to 4 years 10 months|Main Study + Extension Cohort: Number of Participants With Serum Anti-amivantamab Antibodies, Up to 4 years 10 months|Main Study+ Extension Cohort: Change From Baseline With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer - Symptom Assessment Questionnaire (NSCLC-SAQ), Up to 4 years 10 months|Main Study+ Extension Cohort: Change From Baseline With European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC-QLQ-C30), Up to 4 years 10 months|Main Study+ Extension Cohort: Change From Baseline With Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System -Physical Function (PROMIS-PF), Up to 4 years 10 months
