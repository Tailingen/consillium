TGRX-678 US Phase I for Subjects with Refractory or Advanced Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia
The purpose of this single-arm, open-label, dose escalation + cohort expansion study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic and preliminary efficacy of TGRX-678 in Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia patients who had failure with or are intolerant to TKI treatments.

This is the first trial with TGRX-678 conducted to US patients which aims to evaluate the safety profile and preliminary efficacy profile in advanced or refractory CML patients with previous failure or intolerance to TKI treatments. The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety profile of TGRX-678, including determination of the recommended dose for expansion (RDE) and other safety measures of the investigational drug, such as adverse events and abnormal clinical outcomes. Preliminary efficacy profile of TGRX-678 is evaluated based on the changes in peripheral blood cells and disease-associated cytogenetic and molecular markers. Recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) will be determined at end of the study considering safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic and efficacy data.
