Advanced Perfusion MRI of Treatment Response and Progression in Glioblastoma
The primary aim of this project is to Compare new msCS and standard DSC-PWI methods in GBM patients undergoing post-operative MRI for monitoring of tumor progression.
Glioblastoma|Glioblastoma Multiforme
PROCEDURE: MRI
A novel high resolution DSC-PWI imaging method, A novel high resolution DSC-PWI method will be compared to the standard DSC-PWI method to determine whether novel method improves image quality in tumor regions., 2 years
Investigators will compare the novel to the standard DSC-PWI methods in twenty five GBM patients to determine whether novel method improves image quality in tumor regions. We will also compare accuracy of pseudoprogression (PsP) vs. early progressive disease (ePD) determinations by the two techniques. If successful, the project will culminate in a novel imaging method sequence optimized to monitor progression and guide treatment decisions in post-operative GBM patients.
