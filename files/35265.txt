DN24-02 as Adjuvant Therapy in Subjects With High Risk HER2+ Urothelial Carcinoma
This study was conducted to examine survival, disease-free survival, safety, and the magnitude of the immune response induced following administration of DN24-02 in subjects with HER2+ urothelial carcinoma.
Urothelial Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: DN24-02|OTHER: Standard of Care
Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause.

\*This study was terminated early due to administrative reasons., Subjects will be followed from baseline through the remainder of their lives or until study completion (approximately 60 months)
Multicenter, open-label, Phase 2 study. Subjects were randomized to either the investigational product, DN24-02, or to standard of care. Subjects randomized to the experimental arm received DN24-02 at 2-week intervals, for a total of 3 infusions. The study evaluated survival, disease-free survival, safety and the magnitude of the immune response between these 2 subject groups.
