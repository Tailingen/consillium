Sintilimab Combined SBRT As Neoadjuvant Therapy for Resectable HCC with PVTT
The goal of this single-arm, prospective clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy combining sintilimab with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in patients with resectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with branch portal vein tumor thrombus. The main questions it aims to answer are:

1. Is the combination of sintilimab and SBRT safe as neoadjuvant therapy?
2. How effective is this combination in treating resectable HCC with branch PVTT? Participants will be given a combination treatment of sintilimab and SBRT. Researchers will monitor their health conditions to assess the safety and effectiveness of this treatment protocol.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)
RADIATION: stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT)|DRUG: Sintilimab (approved)
1-year Disease-Free Survival (DFS) rate, DFS rate will be measured for each patient starting from the date they begin the treatment until one year after that date.
