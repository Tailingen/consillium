SBRT for Oligo-residual NSCLC After Treatment With PD-1/PD-L1 Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors
Despite the impressive response rate to PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors, resistance inevitably develops in most patients. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) plays a growing role in the management of oligometastatic disease. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SBRT for oligo-residual NSCLC after effective treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors.
NSCLC Stage IV
DRUG: PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (alone or in combination with chemotherapy)|RADIATION: SBRT
Progression-free survival, PFS was measured from the date of the initiation of treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors to the date of disease progression as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) Version 1.1 or death., Two years
Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events, Treatment-related adverse events were assessed and graded according to CTCAE v. 5.0., Two year|Overall Survival, OS was defined as the time from the date of enrollment until death by any cause. Participants still alive at the time of data analysis were censored at the date of last follow-up., Two years
