To Evaluate Sperm Parameters in Men With Secondary Hypogonadism Previously Treated With Topical Testosterone
The study was designed to determine if Androxal速 would affect sperm parameters (count, concentration, volume) in men with secondary hypogonadism who have been previously treated with topical testosterone.
Secondary Hypogonadism
DRUG: 25 mg Androxal|DRUG: Testim 1%
Sperm Concentration, Total sperm concentration was measured., Baseline, Month 3, Month 6, Follow-Up (Month 7)|Motile Total Sperm Count, Motile total sperm count was measured., Baseline, Month 3, Month 6, Follow-Up (Month 7)|Semen Volume, Semen volume was measured., Baseline, Month 3, Month 6, Follow-Up (Month 7)
Luteinizing Hormone (LH) Levels, LH levels were measured., Baseline, Month 3, Month 6, Follow-Up (Month 7)|Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) Levels, FSH levels were measured., Baseline, Month 3, Month 6, Follow-Up (Month 7)
The study was designed to determine if Androxal速 would affect sperm parameters (count, concentration, volume) in men with secondary hypogonadism who have been previously treated with topical testosterone. A maximum of twelve subjects per group were randomized to daily treatments of Androxal速 or topical testosterone (Testim速) for six months. The protocol was later amended to include a treatment group who received Androxal after a 3 month wash out period.
