Intra-ductal Confocal Endomicroscopy for Characterization of Pancreas and Bile Duct Tumor
The endomicroscopy is an adaptation of traditional optical microscopy in the digestive endoscopy. Furthermore, with the integration of a miniaturized laser confocal microscope to a videoendoscope, it's possible to study the digestive mucous by "optical biopsy". This monocentric, non randomized and prospective study uses the Intra-ductal confocal endomicroscopy for the characterization of pancreas and bile duct tumor.
Pancreas Neoplasms|Bile Duct Diseases
PROCEDURE: Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangio-Pancreatography (ERCP)
The principal outcome is the percentage of successful in vivo examination according to the localisation of the stenosis. A successful examination is defined by the obtention of exploitable image for the anatomopathology., 2 days
Study of the concordance between optical and histological biopsy, 2 days|Frequency and grade of adverse effects induced by the confocal endomicroscopy, 2 days
Primary objective:

Obtain a tissular characterization of a biliary or pancreatic stenosis with a confocal microscope which is in direct contact of the stenosis during the Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangio-Pancreatography (ERCP).

Secondary objectives:

* Compare the result of this "optical biopsy" to a conventional biopsy.
* Tolerance
