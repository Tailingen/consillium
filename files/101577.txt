A Study to Evaluate Nivolumab in the Treatment of Early Stage Esophageal or Gastroesophageal Cancer
The purpose of this study is to describe the effectiveness and use of nivolumab after surgery in participants with early stage (Stage II/III) Esophageal Cancer/Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer (EC/GEJC).
