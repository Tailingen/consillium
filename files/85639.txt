Follow-up to Welcome Study C87042 [NCT00308581] Examining Certolizumab Pegol (CDP870) in Subjects With Crohn's Disease
The study will continue to assess the safety of certolizumab pegol (CDP870) as well as examine the evolution of long term efficacy in Crohn's disease patients who completed study C87042 \[NCT00308581\]. It will also assess the effect of subcutaneous CDP870 400 mg on direct cost parameters.

A CDAI score of 150 or below indicates remission and a score above 450 indicates extremely severe disease.
