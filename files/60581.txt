A Phase 1b Study of PEGylated Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase (PEGPH20) Combined With Docetaxel in Subjects With Recurrent Previously Treated Locally Advanced or Metastatic NSCLC
A Phase 1b study for participants with Stage IIIB/IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) to participate in 1 of 2 portions of this study. The first portion is Dose Escalation in which participants are tested with PEGPH20 at various doses (1.6, 3.0, 2.2 and 2.8 micrograms/kilogram (ug/kg)) in addition to dosing with the standard dose of docetaxel (PDoc) of 75 milligrams/meter squared (mg/m\^2) once every 21-day cycle. Based on observations on the safety and tolerability of study treatment from dose escalation cohorts dosed to date (1.6 and 3.0 ug/kg of PEGPH20), two additional dose levels will be tested, 2.2 and 2.8 ug/kg. Up to 30 additional participants may be enrolled to test these dose levels. The second portion of Phase 1b is Cohort Expansion in which the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of PDoc identified in dose escalation is administered every 21 days to approximately 50 participants with high hyaluronan (HA-high) prospectively measured in their tumor tissue.

Number of Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), DLTs were defined as adverse events (AEs) that occurred during Cycle 1 in the Dose Escalation portion of the study, and deemed by the Investigator as related to study treatment., Cycle 1 (Day 1 through Day 21) (1 Cycle = 21 days)|Number of Participants With the Indicated Type of Adverse Events for PEGPH20 and Docetaxel, Throughout the Treatment Period, the assessment of safety was based on AEs, including deaths, non-serious AEs, and serious adverse events, AEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment, and results of vital sign measurements and clinical laboratory assessments (including hematology, clinical chemistry, coagulation parameters, and urinalysis). Additionally, thromboembolic (TE) events were deemed by the Sponsor as AEs of special interest.
