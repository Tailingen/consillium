Oligometastases of the LIVer Treated With Chemotherapy With ou Without Extracranial Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy in Patients With Colorectal Cancer
The role of radiotherapy in metastatic cancer has historically been limited to palliation while metastasectomy or radiofrequency has emerged as playing a major role in disease control. Although resection is the standard of care for liver metastasis, 80-90% of patients are not resectable at diagnosis in particular because of the presence of oligometastases. Factors that favour a truly oligometastatic state include a long latent interval between the treatment of the primary tumor and the appearance of metastases.

Oligometastatic cancer is a very heterogeneous disease with respect to several factors including the location of the primary tumor. With the advent of extracranial stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), higher biological equivalent doses can be safely delivered in 3 to 5 fractions, thus potentially ablating all the tissue in the treated area while protecting more efficiently the hosting organ and healthy tissues surrounding the tumors.

In patients with liver oligometastases, in-field local control rates at 2 years range from 70% to 90% with less than 5% severe grade 3 or higher toxicity rates. Retrospective studies indicate that roughly 20% of the patients remain disease-free 2 to 4 years after SBRT.

For patients treated with SBRT some authors found that half of the patients had either no metastatic progression or very little progression in terms of number and site of metastases. The patterns of failure after SBRT for oligometastases in one organ showed that 73% of patients eventually developed new metastases with higher than 80% occurring as new metastases in the same index organ. These findings support the idea of an oligometastatic state in which aggressive local therapy could improve progression-free survival (PFS).

With this phase III study, we sought to evaluate the impact of SBRT on PFS at 2 years in patients with synchronous or metachronous liver-only oligometastases from colorectal cancers patients after a first line chemotherapy for metastatic disease but not having progressed during first line chemotherapy and up to 1 year
