A Study of DNIB0600A in Comparison With Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin (PLD) in Participants With Platinum-Resistant Ovarian Cancer (PROC)
This randomized, multicenter, open-label study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of DNIB0600A (RO5541081) in comparison with PLD in participants with PROC, primary peritoneal cancer or fallopian tube cancer. Participants will be randomized to receive either DNIB0600A 2.4 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks or PLD 40 milligrams per meter-squared (mg/m\^2) IV every 4 weeks.
