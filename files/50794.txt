LZM009 to Treat Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
To assess the safety and tolerability of IV administered LZM009 in subjects with advanced solid tumors who have progressed or are non-responsive to available therapies.
Solid Tumor
BIOLOGICAL: LZM009,recombinant humanized anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody for injection
Determine number of patients experiencing dose limiting toxicities, And frequency and severity of DLT at LZM009 doses of 1mg/kg, 3mkg/kg and 10mkg/kg at 28 days after the first dose., Day 1 through Day 28|Determine Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D), Determination of MTD and RP2D is dependent on number of cohorts and patients experiencing DLT., 17 months|Number of patients experiencing clinical or laboratory adverse events as a measure of safety and tolerability, Safety variables include incidence and severity of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and immune-related AEs (irAEs), vital signs measurements, clinical laboratory values and ECGs as determined by CTCAEv4.03., Screening to 28 days after last treatment administration, or until drug related toxicities have resolved, whichever is later; or earlier than 28 days should the patient commence another anti-cancer therapy in the meantime, approximately 17 weeks.
Characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) profiles of LZM009 in blood specimens of subjects with at least 1 dose, Predose, 0 h, 2 h, 6h, 24h, days 3, 8, 15 and 22 post infusion of cycle 1; predose of cycle 2 and 3; pre-dose, 0 h, 2 h, 6h, days 8, and 15 post infusion of cycle 4 and predose of every other cycle after Cycle 5(one cycle=21 days except Cycle 1=28 days).|Characterize the immunogenicity profiles of LZM009 in blood specimens of subjects with at least 1 dose, Presence of anti-LZM009 antibodies/neutralizing anti-LZM009 antibodies (nAbs) and effect on PK of LZM009., Predose on C1D1, C2D1, C4D1, and at predose of every other cycle after Cycle 5, thereafter for the first 12 months, and 28 days after the last dose(one cycle=21 days except Cycle 1=28 days).|Assess preliminary anti-tumor activity of LZM009 in subjects with advanced solid tumors, Overall response rate (ORR) by the Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1., 17 months
