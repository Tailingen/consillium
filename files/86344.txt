A Study of EMB-02 in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
The primary purpose of this study is to identify the recommended Phase 2 dose(s) (RP2Ds) and schedule assessed to be safe for EMB-02 and to characterize the safety and tolerability of EMB-02 at the RP2Ds. Pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, and the anti-tumor activity of EMB-02 will also be assessed.
Advanced Solid Tumors
BIOLOGICAL: EMB-02
Incidence and severity of adverse events as assessed by CTCAE V5.0, Incidence and severity of AE., Screening up to follow-up (30 days after the last dose)|Incidence of serious adverse events (SAE), Incidence of SAE., Screening up to follow-up (30 days after the last dose)|Incidence of dose interruptions, Incidence of dose interruptions of EMB-02 during treatment as a measure of tolerability., Screening up to follow-up (30 days after the last dose)|Dose intensity, Actual amount of drug taken by patients divided by the planned amount., Screening up to follow-up (30 days after the last dose)|The incidence of DLTs during the first cycle of treatment., The Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) are based on drug related adverse events and are specifically defined in study protocol., First infusion to the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Antitumor activity(Objective Response Rate (ORR), Measured by RECIST 1.1, only applicable in Phase II part, From the date of dosing until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, expected average 6 months
Area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) of EMB-02, Blood samples for serum PK analysis will be obtained (AUC)., Through treatment until EOT visit, expected average 6 months|Maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of EMB-02, Blood samples for serum PK analysis will be obtained (Cmax), Through treatment until EOT visit, expected average 6 months|Trough concentration (Ctrough) of EMB-02, Blood samples for serum PK analysis will be obtained (Ctrough), Through treatment until EOT visit, expected average 6 months|Average concentration over a dosing interval (Css, avg)of EMB-02., Blood samples for serum PK analysis will be obtained (Css, avg)., Through treatment until EOT visit, expected average 6 months|Terminal half-life (T1/2) of EMB-02, Blood samples for serum PK analysis will be obtained (T1/2), Through treatment until EOT visit, expected average 6 months.|Systemic clearance (CL) of EMB-02, Blood samples for serum PK analysis will be obtained (CL)., Through treatment until EOT visit, expected average 6 months|Steady state volume of distribution (Vss) of EMB-02, Blood samples for serum PK analysis will be obtained (Vss)., Through treatment until EOT visit, expected average 6 months|Progression free survival (PFS) of EMB-02 as assessed by RECIST 1.1, Preliminary anti-tumor activity of EMB-02 will be obtained (PFS)., From the date of dosing until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, expected average 6 months|Duration of response of EMB-02 as assessed by RECIST 1.1, Preliminary anti-tumor activity of EMB-02 will be obtained (DOR)., From the date of dosing until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, expected average 6 months|Incidence and titer of anti-drug antibodies stimulated by EMB-02, Antibodies to EMB-02 will be assessed to evaluate potential immunogenicity., Up to End of Treatment Follow Up Period (30 days after the last dose)
This is a Phase I/II, multi-center, open label, multiple-dose, first in human study, designed to assess safety and tolerability, and to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dos(s)e (RP2D\[s\]) for EMB-02 in patients with advanced solid tumors. Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity, and response will also be assessed.
