Effects of Anesthetic Methods on Hepatic Cancer Cell Malignancy
Numerous studies found that anesthetic methods can influence the recurrence of tumor and the overall survival of patients after primary cancer surgery. Radiofrequency (RF) ablation is now widely used in clinic for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Currently, diverse anesthetic methods, including general anesthesia (GA), epidural anesthesia and local anesthesia (LA), are used for RF ablation surgery. Using serum from HCC surgery patients randomized to receive either GA or LA during surgery, we investigated the effects of anesthetic methods on proliferation, migration and metastasis in HepG2 hepatic cancer cells in vitro.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: anesthetic methods
cell proliferation, HepG2 cells will be cultured with serum from patients undergoing RF ablation under GA or LA for 24h and cell proliferation will be measured, 1 hour post-surgery
cell migration, HepG2 cells will be cultured with serum from patients undergoing RF ablation under GA or LA and cell migration will be measured, 1 hour post-surgery|cell metastasis, HepG2 cells will be cultured with serum from patients undergoing RF ablation under GA or LA and cell metastasis will be measured, 1 hour post-surgery
