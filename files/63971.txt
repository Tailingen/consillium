Pemetrexed as the First Treatment in Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer
The purposes of this study are to determine whether pemetrexed can help patients with metastatic (cancer that has spread to other parts of the body) breast cancer, to determine any side effects that may be associated with the drug, to determine how much pemetrexed should be given to patients, and to collect DNA for future research regarding metastatic breast cancer. The collection of DNA is optional to the patient.
Breast Cancer|Breast Neoplasms, Male|Carcinoma, Ductal
DRUG: pemetrexed
Overall Tumor Response, Best response recorded from the start of treatment until disease progression/recurrence using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria that defines when participants improve ("respond"), stay the same ("stable"), or worsen ("progression") during treatment., every 3 cycles (approximately 6-7 weeks) or until patient has disease progression
Toxicity Profile: Adverse Events (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Grade 3 and 4, Present in >5% of Participants), Participants rated for toxicity prior to each cycle using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 (CTCAE). Grades range from 0 (no AE or within normal limits) to 5 (death related to AE)., every 14 day cycle, and during 30-days post-therapy follow-up and long-term follow-up|Duration of Tumor Response, Defined as time from first observation of complete response or partial response to the first observation of progressive disease or death due to any cause., every 3 cycles (approximately 6-7 weeks) or until patient has disease progression|Progression-Free Survival Time, Defined as the time from date of first dose to the first observation of disease progression, or death due to any cause., every 3 cycles (approximately 6-7 weeks) or until patient has disease progression|Overall Survival Time, Defined as the time from date of first dose to time of death due to any cause., every 14 day cycle, during 30-days post-therapy follow-up, and every 6 months during the long-term follow-up
