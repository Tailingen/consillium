Retrospective Study Assessment Treatment Response Faslodex®( 500 mg)
This retrospective observational study is designed to assess the response to treatment with fulvestrant at a dose of 500 mg/month with a loading dose of 500 mg (LD-500), in terms of progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and clinical benefit rate (CBR), in post-menopausal women with Advanced Breast Cancer and estrogen receptor positive, who were treated with this medicinal product and at said dose after having progressed with a previous anti-estrogen therapy. During this study, a retrospective data collection will be carried out using the information contained in the Clinical History of said patients, provided that the treatment with fulvestrant at a dose of 500 mg and LD-500.
Malignant Neoplasm of Breast Stage IV
DRUG: Fulvestrant
Progression Free Survival, Response to treatment with fulvestrant (Faslodex®) in terms of Progression Free Survival.

Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% or more increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., 22 months
Clinical Benefit Rate, Response to treatment with fulvestrant in terms of Clinical Benefit Rate. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI or TC: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; PD (progressive disease)\> = 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion or the appearance of new lesions; Clinical Benefit = CR + PR+ Stable Disease (not progression of the disease for 24 or more weeks)., 22 months|Overall Survival, Response to treatment with fulvestrant in terms of Overall Survival, 22 months|Duration of Clinical Benefit, Response to treatment with fulvestrant in terms of Duration of the Clinical Benefit.

Based on the results of the CONFIRM Study, a centralised change in the dosage of Faslodex® to 500 mg/month, with an additional pre-loading dose of 500 mg fourteen days after treatment smart was authorised in Europe; the dose is indicated for the treatment of post-menopausal women with ABC, hormone receptor positive and whose disease had progressed after anti-estrogen therapy.

Several sites worldwide participated in this study, but given the importance of the results obtained and their impact, we believe it is important to have local data available in Spain that would enable us to determine how this new 500 mg dose of Faslodex® behaves in the treatment and to assess treatment response within standard clinical practice and the current indications of this drug.

Therefore, we designed this retrospective, observational study in which we will measure response in term of PFS using data collected from the Clinical History.

Likewise, other variables will be studied: OS, CBR, duration of clinical benefit, tolerability and safety. Patient subgroups, like those who over-express her-2, according to levels of ki-67 and the presence or not of visceral metastases will also be studied.

This retrospective observational study is designed to assess the response to treatment with fulvestrant at a dose of 500 mg/month with a loading dose of 500 mg (LD-500), in terms of progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), clinical benefit rate (CBR), and duration of clinical benefit (DCB, in post-menopausal women with Advanced Breast Cancer and estrogen receptor positive, who were treated with this medicinal product and at said dose after having progressed with a previous anti-estrogen therapy. During this study, a retrospective data collection will be carried out using the information contained in the Clinical History of said patients, provided that the treatment with fulvestrant at a dose of 500 mg and LD-500, had occurred at some point between 1 January 2010 and 31 October 2011 (hereinafter, the study period).

Thus, we will obtain the PFS, OS and CBR data, as well as information on safety and tolerability.
