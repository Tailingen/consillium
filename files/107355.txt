Trial of Antigen Pulsed Dendritic Cells (APDC) in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
This trial is to compare the efficacy and safety of modified FOLFOX6 \[mFOLFOX6, a specific chemotherapy regimen of Oxaliplatin ,5-Fluorouracil and Leucovorin\] chemotherapy plus Antigen Pulsed Dendritic Cells (APDCï¼Œa kind of autologous tumor lysates pulsed human dendritic cells vaccine) with modified chemotherapy alone in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: APDC + Chemotherapy|DRUG: Chemotherapy
Progression Free Survival, PFS, Time from the randomization date to the start of disease progression (progression assessed by investigator using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1 guidelines) for metastatic colorectal cancer subjects., Up to approximately six years
Objective Response, From randomisation to occurrence of objective response( complete regression (CR) and partial regression (PR) need to be confirmed 28 days after the occurrence), Up to approximately six years|Overall Survival, OS, From randomisation to the time of death of any cause., Up to approximately six years|Clinical benefit Rate, From randomisation to confirmation of objective response, Up to approximately six years|Quality of Life, From randomisation to the end of all treatments (according to the EORTC QLQ-C30: European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30), Up to approximately six months|Adverse Events, From randomisation to the end of follow-up, Up to approximately six years
Metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) patients will be randomly assigned (3:1) to receive either modified FOLFOX6 \[mFOLFOX6\] chemotherapy combined with Antigen Pulsed Dendritic Cells (Arm APDC + Chemotherapy), or chemotherapy alone (Arm Chemotherapy). Each patient recruited in the study will receive maximum 12 cycles of (14 days/cycle) mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy. Patients in Arm APDC + Chemotherapy will receive APDC vaccination in addition to chemotherapy in the cycle 1-3 and 7-9, and in cycle 4-6 and 10-12 receive only chemotherapy. APDC + Chemotherapy or Chemotherapy will be stopped in case of disease progression, intolerable toxicities, or patient withdrawal with the consent. After 12 cycles, patients in Arm APDC + Chemotherapy will receive 5-Fluorouracil treatment plus every 3 months APDC therapy and patients in Arm Chemotherapy will receive only 5-Fluorouracil treatment. PFS, ORR and OS will be assessed, and toxicity and immunologic effects will be monitored.
