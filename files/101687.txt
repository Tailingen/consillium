Brief Pain Inventory - Measure of Participant Pain, The short-form BPI will be used to quantify pain severity and pain interference. The BPI contains 4 pain severity items and 7 pain interference items, all rated on a scale from 0 to 10 (higher ratings indicate worse pain intensity/interference). A pain severity subscale score can be computed by taking the average rating of the 4 pain severity items. This subscale will be our primary outcome measure. A pain interference subscale score can be similarly computed for the 7 pain interference items. BPI should be completed prior to removing pain relieving plaster at the end of each day., 14 days from baseline
