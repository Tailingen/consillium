The Efficacy of the Bladder EpiCheck for Detection of Recurrent Urothelial Cell Carcinoma
Clinical trial to determine the efficacy (sensitivity and specificity) of the Bladder EpiCheck test compared to the gold standard cystoscopy and pathology in patients under monitoring for recurrence of bladder cancer.
Bladder Cancer
DEVICE: Bladder EpiCheck Urine Test|PROCEDURE: Cystoscopy and pathology
Specificity of Bladder EpiCheck Urine Test Kit (the proportion of negatives that are correctly identified as such by the gold standard), Day 1|Sensitivity of Bladder EpiCheck Urine Test Kit (The proportion of positives that are correctly identified as such by the gold standard), Day 1
The Bladder EpiCheck test is an in vitro diagnostic device for the detection of DNA methylation patterns in urine that are associated with bladder cancer. It is intended for use as a noninvasive method for monitoring for tumor recurrence in conjunction with cystoscopy inpatients previously diagnosed with bladder cancer This is a, multicenter, prospective, blinded study to evaluate the efficacy (sensitivity and specificity) of a novel methylation test for the detection of recurrent Urothelial Cell Carcinoma in patients with a history of bladder cancer undergoing surveillance.
