Carfilzomib, Lenalidomide, and Dexamethasone in New Multiple Myeloma Patients
Background:

- Carfilzomib is an experimental anti-cancer drug that has not yet been approved for treating multiple myeloma. Lenalidomide is a drug that may stop tumor growth and help the immune system kill cancer cells. Dexamethasone is a drug that helps stop inflammation. It is sometimes used to treat (alone or with other drugs) certain types of cancer, especially multiple myeloma. This combination of drugs has not been tested in people with multiple myeloma. Researchers want to see whether it is safe and effective for this group.

Objectives:

- To test the effectiveness of combined carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone in treating multiple myeloma.

Eligibility:

- People at least 18 years of age who have multiple myeloma that has not been treated.

Design:

* Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will also have blood and urine tests, a bone marrow sample, and molecular imaging studies.
* Participants will have eight 28-day cycles of treatment. The combined study drugs will be given as tablets and injections. Those in the study will be monitored with frequent blood tests, bone marrow samples, and molecular imaging studies. In addition to current standard measures to determine clinical responses, molecular tests will be conducted to define evidence of minimal residual disease.
* After the first four cycles of therapy, those who are eligible for a stem cell transplant will have stem cells collected and stored for use if the cancer returns.
* After stem cell collection, participants will have the second four treatment cycles.

  -, If the disease has improved or is stable at the end of eight cycles, those in the study may have another 12 cycles of low-dose (maintenance) lenalidomide alone.
* Participants will have regular follow-up visits after the end of the study chemotherapy.

Number of Participants With Serious and Non-serious Adverse Events, Here is the number of participants with serious and non-serious adverse events assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria in Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.0). A non-serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence. A serious adverse event is an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that results in death, a life threatening adverse drug experience, hospitalization, disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, congenital anomaly/birth defect or important medical events that jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the previous outcomes mentioned., 4 years and 9 months and 2 days
Overall Response Rate, Response is assessed by the International Myeloma Working Group Criteria. Patients who attained a partial response or better (BoR) response by the end of induction. Partial response is ≥50% reduction of serum M-protein and reduction in 24h urinary M-protein., 48.3 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS) at 48 Months, PFS is defined as time of start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first. Response is assessed by the International Myeloma Working Group Criteria. Progressive disease requires any one or more of the following: increase of ≥25% from lowest response value in the following on 2 consecutive measurements: serum M-component and/or (the absolute increase must be ≥0.5g/dl). Urine M-component and/or (the absolute increase must be ≥200mg/24h. Only in patients without measurable serum and urine M-protein levels: the difference between involved and uninvolved free light chain (FLC) levels. The absolute increase must be \>10mg/dl. Bone marrow plasma cell percentage: the absolute % must be ≥10%. Definite development of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas or definite increase in size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas. Development of hypercalcemia that can be attributed solely to the plasma cell proliferative disorder., 48 months|Percentage of Responders With Duration of Response (DOR) at 48 Months, Response is assessed by the International Myeloma Working Group Criteria. DOR is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for a partial response or better until first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented. Partial response is ≥50% reduction of serum M-protein and reduction in 24-h urinary M-protein by ≥90% or to \<200mg per 24h. Progressive disease requires any one or more of the following: increase of ≥25% from lowest response value in the following on 2 consecutive measurements: serum M-component and/or (the absolute increase must be ≥0.5g/dl). Urine M-component and/or (the absolute increase must be ≥200mg/24h. Only in patients without measurable serum and urine M-protein levels: the difference between involved and uninvolved free light chain (FLC) levels. The absolute increase must be \>10mg/dl. Bone marrow plasma cell percentage: the absolute % must be ≥10%., 48 months|Overall Survival (OS) Rate, OS is defined as the time of start of treatment to death from any cause., up to 6 months|Cluster of Differentiation 138 (CD138) + Plasma Cells Gene Expression Profiling on Pre and Post Carfilzomib Exposure Bone Marrow Samples, Cluster of differentiation 138+ (CD138)+ plasma cells purified from bone marrow aspirates to identify potential markers of early progression. Changes in selected genes were confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) if suggested to be related to risk of progression to multiple myeloma., Cycle 1 Day 1, an average of 28 days ± 2 days|Rate of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) by Flow Cytometry, Response is assessed by the International Myeloma Working Group Criteria. Complete response is negative immunofixation on the serum and urine and disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas and ≤ 5% plasma cells in bone marrow. MRD is defined by M-spike, plasma cell burden, and abnormal free light chains. Immunophenotyping is performed by multi-parametric flow cytometry., Day 100|Complete Response (CR) and Minimal Residual Disease Neg (MRDneg) CR Rates at Treatment Intervals With Carfilzomib, Lenalidomide & Dexamethasone (CRd) in New Multiple Myeloma Patients After 8 Cycles of Induction, 1 Year Maintenance, and 2 Years Maintenance, Response is assessed by the International Myeloma Working Group Criteria. MRD is defined by M-spike, plasma cell burden, and abnormal free light chains (FLC). Complete response is negative immunofixation on serum, and urine and disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas and ≤ 5% plasma cells in bone marrow. Stringent complete response (sCR) is normal FLC ratio and absence of clonal cells in bone marrow by immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence. Near complete response (nCR) is the absence of myeloma protein on electrophoresis, independent of immunofixation status. Very good partial response (VGPR) is serum and urine M-protein detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis or 90% or greater reduction in serum M-protein plus urine M-protein level \<100mg per 24h. Overall response rate (ORR) is patients who attained a partial response (PR) (≥50% reduction of serum M-protein and reduction in 24h urinary M-protein) or better (BoR) response., up to 2 years
Background:

* Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable plasma cell neoplasm with a median survival of 3-4 years.
* Novel agent combinations with proteasome inhibitors demonstrate improved response rates while increasing survival in MM patients.
* A common debilitating side effect of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib is neuropathy.
* Carfilzomib is a new proteasome inhibitor with potent anti-MM effects and decreased peripheral neuropathy
