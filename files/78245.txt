Dose Finding Study of RAD001 (Everolimus, Afinitor®) in Combination With BEZ235 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
Study has two parts:

1. Dose-finding: to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of RAD001 (everolimus , Afinitor®) in combination with BEZ235 in patients with advanced solid tumors.
2. Dose-expansion: to assess safety and tolerability of RAD001 and BEZ235 at the MTD in patients with ER+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer and metastatic renal cell cancer

DRUG: RAD001 + BEZ235
Probability of a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) by the end of the first treatment cycle (DLT), The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the dose limiting toxicities during the first cycle of treatment, First treatment cycle (28 days)|Incidence of DLT in patients by the end of the first treatment cycle in the co-administration of RAD001 and BEZ235, Frequency of DLTs during the first cycle of treatment, First treatment cycle (28 days)|Number of participants with adverse events and serious adverse events., Measured by abnormal safety laboratory parameters, changes in electrocardiograms (ECGs), changes in vital signs and changes in physical examination parameters., 12 months
Time versus blood concentration profiles, Analysis of pharmacokinetic parameters in blood samples, First treatment cycle ( 28 days)|Overall Response Rate (ORR) (Complete Response (CR) + Partial Response (PR)) according to local assessments by RECIST 1.0 for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and metastatic breast cancer (MBC) in dose expansion phase, CT or MRI imaging parameters to determine the overall response rate (complete response, partial response, stable disease, or progressive disease) according to the RECIST 1.0 criteria., 8 weeks|Progresive Free Survival (PFS) according to local assessments by RECIST 1.0 for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and metastatic breast cancer (MBC) in dose expansion phase, CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging parameters to determine the PFS according to the RECIST 1.0 criteria, 8 weeks|Duration of response (DoR) according to local assessments by RECIST 1.0 for RCC and MBC in dose expansion phase, CT or MRI imaging parameters to determine the duration of response according to the RECIST 1.0 criteria, 8 weeks
