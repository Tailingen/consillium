Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial of Glutamine for Breast Cancer Patients With Peripheral Neuropathy
Patients with breast cancer receiving paclitaxel chemotherapy who have mild symptoms of peripheral neuropathy will receive glutamine or placebo to try and improve symptoms.
Peripheral Neuropathy|Breast Cancer
DRUG: glutamine|DRUG: Placebo
Change in Peripheral Neuropathy Score, Used the clinical total neuropathy score scale (TNSc). The presence of sensory, motor, pin sensibility, vibration sensibility, DTR, autonomic symptoms was assessed. For each item, the possible score ranged between 0 (normal) and 4 (worst possible result).

Outcomes calculated as neuropathy score value at 10 Weeks minus neuropathy score value at Baseline. Increased score value indicates increased neuropathy severity., Duration of study, approximately 10 weeks per subject
1. Determine whether oral glutamine supplementation can reduce the symptoms and signs of peripheral neuropathy.
2. Determine whether alterations in the symptoms and signs of peripheral neuropathy are correlated with an alteration of circulating nerve growth factor or insulin-like growth factor levels.
3. Assess whether oral glutamine affects circulating nerve growth factor or insulin-like growth factor levels.
4. Assess whether glutamine interferes with paclitaxel pharmacokinetics
