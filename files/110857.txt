Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Preliminary Efficacy of ASD141
This is a Phase I study designed to evaluate if ASD141 is safe, tolerable, and efficacious in participants with advanced solid tumors.

This is a multicenter, first-in-human (FIH), open-label, non-randomized, dose escalation study of ASD141 to evaluate safety, tolerability, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of ASD141 in subjects with advanced solid tumors. The study includes 4 dose cohorts.
