This study was designed to determine the overall response rate (ORR) of oral Dabrafenib in combination with oral Trametinib in subjects with rare BRAF V600E mutated cancers. Subjects needed to have a fresh or frozen tumor tissue sample provided to confirm the BRAF V600E mutation status. Only subjects with histologically confirmed advanced disease and no available standard treatment options were eligible for enrollment. Subjects underwent screening assessments within 14 days (up to 35 days for ophthalmology exam, echocardiogram or disease assessments) prior to the start of treatment to determine their eligibility for enrollment in the study. All subjects enrolled received oral dabrafenib 150 mg bid in combination with oral trametinib 2 mg once daily. Subjects continued treatment until an unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, withdrawal of consent or death. Once a subject discontinued treatment, a post-treatment follow-up visit was conducted within 28 days (+ 7 days) after the last dose of study treatment(s). Extended follow-up visits were conducted every 4 weeks (+/- 7 days) for the first 6 months and then every 3 months (+/- 14 days) thereafter. A subject was considered to have discontinued the study if the subject was lost to follow-up or withdrew consent or another reason existed that prevented additional data from being collected on the subject. A subject was considered to have completed the study at the time of death.

For each histology, up to 25 patients were planned to be enrolled in each of the 9 primary analysis cohorts. A cohort could be closed or stopped early (prior to capping at 25 patients) for futility or efficacy. An uncapped expansion cohort was planned when a particular cohort was stopped early for efficacy. All planned histology cohorts enrolled at least one subject, with the exception of the germ cell tumor cohort. Enrolment in the study was closed in July 2018.
