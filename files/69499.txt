Endostar Aggressive Treatment of Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma (PTCL) Phase II Clinical Study
The aim of this study is to evaluate anti-tumor safety and efficacy of endostar®（Human recombinant endostatin injection）combined with traditional GDP （gemcitabine+dexamethasone+cis-platinum）chemotherapy for newly diagnosed or relapsed PTCL(aggressive peripheral T-cell lymphomas) patients in phase II clinical study.
Peripheral T-cell Lymphomas
DRUG: GDP|BIOLOGICAL: Endostar
ORR(Overall release rate), According to the Cheson standard recommended by NCCN (National Comprehensive Cancer Network)guidelines of USA, the evaluation of the clinical effect of the drug on tumor was evaluated by comparing the change of tumor size and duration., Change from Baseline at the week 6,12, 18 of treatment phase and the month 3, 6, 9 and 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30 ,33,36 of the followup phase
PFS（progression-free survival）, Change from Baseline at the week 3, 6, 9, 12, 15,18 of the treatment phase, the month 3, 6, 9 and 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30 ,33,36 of the followup phase.|DCR(disease control rate), Change from Baseline at the week 3, 6, 9, 12, 15,18 of the treatment phase, the month 3, 6, 9 and 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30 ,33,36 of the followup phase.|OS（overall survival）, Change from Baseline at the week 3, 6, 9, 12, 15,18 of the treatment phase, the month 3, 6, 9 and 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30 ,33,36 of the followup phase.|Adverse reaction, Change from Baseline at the week 3, 6, 9, 12, 15,18 of the treatment phase|The quality of life（QOL） Questionnaire, Change from Baseline at the week 3, 6, 9, 12, 15,18 of the treatment phase, the month 3, 6, 9 and 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30 ,33,36 of the followup phase.
Endostar is a conventional drug for treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer, nowadays,Endostar has been used in a variety of extra-pulmonary tumor treatment in clinical.Some basic experiments and clinical researchs confirm that Endostar can restitute the tumor stability after cyclophosphamide or rituximab treatment.

The aim of this study is to evaluate anti-tumor safety and efficacy of endostar for newly diagnosed or relapsed PTCL patients based on chemotherapy combined with conventional GDP.This is a multi-center, open, randomized-controlled, phase II clinical study.

Following a run-in period, approximately 60 subjects will be randomly assigned to conventional chemotherapy treatment group, endostar and conventional chemotherapy treatment group for 1 year. After the 1 year treatment period, subjects in two treatments arms will be followed for 1 year.
