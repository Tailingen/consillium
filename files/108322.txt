Resection And Partial Liver Segmental Transplantation With Delayed Total Hepatectomy
RAPID is an auxiliary liver transplantation where a small liver partial graft (namely left lateral segments from living or cadaveric donors) is implanted orthotopically after a left hepatectomy of the native liver. Subsequently, in order to implement a fast regeneration of the transplanted segments a portal flow diversion is operated in the direction of the future remnant. After obtaining a fast regeneration of the auxiliary future remnant liver the native liver hepatectomy is completed as in a two stage- hepatectomy. Peculiar inclusion criteria will be adopted for patient selection with particular reference to the admission of patients with \<3 lung metastases radically treated before transplantation.
Liver Metastases
PROCEDURE: Liver transplantation
Percent of transplanted patients receiving second stage hepatectomy within 4 weeks of segment 2/3 transplantation, Rate of second stage hepatectomy performed within 4 weeks from transplatation, within 4 weeks from liver transplantation
Intention to treat survival after liver transplantation, Time from transplantation to either death or censoring, 3 and 5 years|Progression free survival, Time from enrolement to either progression or censoring, 3 and 5 years|Proportion of drop out, Rate of drop out from listing, within 100 days from listing|Mortality, Rate of death within 90 days after second stage hepatectomy, within 90 days from second stage hepatectomy|Complication rate, Complications according to Dindo Clavien Classification, within 90 days after liver transplant
