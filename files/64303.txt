TERPS Trial for De Novo Oligometastic Prostate Cancer
This research is being done to see if we can improve the outcome of prostate cancer patients who present with metastatic lesions at initial diagnosis.
Prostate Cancer|Oligometastatic Disease
RADIATION: Prostate radiation (XRT)|DRUG: Systemic Therapy|RADIATION: Stereotactic ablative radiation therapy (SABR)
To determine the 2-year failure-free survival (FFS) of men who have oligometastatic prostate cancer with BST+XRT versus BST+XRT+SABR MDT., Cross-over to the SABR MDT is allowed following failure., 2 years
To determine the number of participants with toxicities related to SABR MDT in patients with de novo oligometastatic disease, Adverse events will be assessed at baseline, on treatment visit, and follow-up visit., 5 years|To determine local control at 12-months after SABR MDT in patients with de novo oligometastatic disease., 1 year|To assess time to progression, Progression will be assessed for time to locoregional progression, time to distant progression, time to new metastasis, radiographic progression-free survival and duration of response after randomization to best systemic therapy (BST) and primary prostate radiation (XRT) versus BST, XRT and stereotactic ablative radiation therapy (SABR) metastasis-directed therapy (MDT)., 5 years|Quality of life assessed through EPIC tool utilizing patient scores in each function group following completion of SABR MDT., EPIC quality of life tool will be used to assess quality of life following treatment. This survey will be completed at baseline and during follow-up visits. Averages will be taken for each section in the survey (Urinary Function, Bowel Function, Sexual Function, and Hormonal function)., 5 years
This study will compare the effects, good and/or bad, of using the standard of care treatment (systemic therapy + primary prostate radiation) compared to standard of care treatment plus stereotactic ablative radiation therapy (SABR) to metastatic lesions for prostate patients. The researchers are also trying to learn if the addition of SABR will affect recurrence rates. Presence of circulating tumor cells, gut bacteria, and quality of life will be assessed for both groups.
