The Sakakibara Health Integrative Profile of Atherosclerotic-Carcinogenesis Hypothesis (SHIP-AC)
As previously reported (IJC Heart \& Vasculature 2017; 17: 11.), our epidemiological analysis showing high incidence of cancers in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases as compared with those with non-atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases may imply a clinical possibility of a role of atherosclerosis in cancer developments. In the present study, to address our hypothesis that cancer developments may come with a strength of atherosclerosis, we traced an incidence of cancers in a total of 8,856 patients with coronary artery diseases (CAD) for a median follow-up of 1,095 days (interquartile range, 719-1,469 days) using the Sakakibara Health Integrative Profile (SHIP) database.

In accordance with a presence or absence of poly-arterial diseases such as aortic and/or peripheral artery diseases as an indicator of a strength of atherosclerosis, an incidence of cancers and all-cause death in two cohorts of 8,140 patients with CAD-only and 716 with CAD with poly-arterial diseases were evaluated to track an incidence of cancers and ali-cause mortality during median follou-up periods of 3 to 4 years.
