Anti-CD19 FasT CAR-T Cell Therapy for B Cell NHL
Although the anti-CD19 CAR-T cell therapies have gained significant results in patients with relapsed and refractory B-cell hematologic malignancies. To make a further improvement, adapting the FasT CAR-T cells manufacture technology to shorten the manufacturing time and maintain the stemness of CAR-T cells. We launch such a clinical trial using CD19 targeted CAR-T cells for patients with relapsed and refractory B-cell NHL to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CD19 targeted CAR-T cell therapy.
