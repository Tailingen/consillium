Personalized Immune Cell Therapy Targeting Neoantigen of Malignant Solid Tumors
This single center, single arm and prospective study aimed to establish gene mutation database and select the neoantigens in patients with advanced malignant melanoma, bladder cancer and colorectal cancer. Then, we intended to explore the safety and efficacy of individual tumor antigen-sensitized DC vaccine and their sensitized T cells in these solid cancers.
