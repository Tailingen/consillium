Effects of Aromatherapy with Essential Oils on Anxiety and Depression in Perioperative Patients with Pancreatic Cancer
The objective of this study is to investigate whether aromatherapy essential oils are effective in alleviating anxiety and depression in participants undergoing perioperative pancreatic cancer treatment. Researchers compared aromatherapy essential oils with a placebo (a substance that appears similar but contains no essential oils) to determine their efficacy in reducing anxiety and depression in these participants. Participants were required to undergo aromatherapy for 2 hours daily over a period of 15 days. Assessments of anxiety and depression were conducted one day before surgery, 14 days after surgery, and 42 days after surgery, with their scores recorded accordingly.

Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Zung\[20\] self-rating Anxiety Scale was adopted, which was compiled in 1971, with a total of 20 items, and scored according to the four levels of "no or occasionally (1 point)","sometimes (2 points)", "often (3 points)" and"always (4 points) ", in which items 5, 9, 13, 17 and 19 were scored in reverse. Add the scores of all items, multiply by the coefficient 1.25, and take their integer parts and remember them to the standard score. After the Chinese revision of the scale in China, the norm results are judged as follows: SAS standard score \<50 is no anxiety, 50 \~ 59 is mild anxiety, 60 \~69 is moderate anxiety, ≥70 is severe anxiety, the higher the score, the more serious the anxiety. Cronbach's a coefficient of the scale was 0.799, indicating good reliability and validity., Within 24 hours on the day of admission, after intervention (14 days after surgery) and 28 days after intervention (42 days after surgery).|Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS), The Zung\[21\] Self-rating Depression Scale, which was developed in 1965, was used to assess the subjective feelings of individuals with depressive symptoms. There are 20 items that are scored on a 4-point scale based on the frequency of symptoms, where "1" means no or occasionally, "2" means sometimes, "3" means often, and "4" means always. Items 2, 5, 6, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17, 18, and20 are negative scoring questions, which are calculated as 4 to 1 points. Add the scores of all items, multiply by the coefficient1.25, and take their integer parts and remember them to the standard score. A standard score of \<53 indicates no depression, a score of 53-62 indicates mild depression, a score of 63-72 indicates moderate depression, a score of ≥73 indicates severe depression, and the higher the score, the more severe the depression. Cronbach's a coefficient of this scale was 0.78, indicating good reliability and validity., Within 24 hours on the day of admission, after intervention (14 days after surgery) and 28 days after intervention (42 days after surgery).
