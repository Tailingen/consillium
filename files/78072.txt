Clinical Study of Apatinib and XELOX Combination Regimen to Treat Colorectal Cancer Patients
This study makes an observation over the objective response rate of Apatinib and XELOX combination regimen in the first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. All the participants will receive the treatment of Apatinib and XELOX combination regimen.
Colorectal Neoplasms
DRUG: Apatinib and XELOX combined treatment group
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR=complete response (CR) + partial response (PR) .And expected ORR is 0.55., up to 9 months
Progression-free Survival (PFS), time from randomization to documented progressive disease or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, up to 2 years|Overall Survival (OS), up to 2 years
XELOX chemotherapy is an effective therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer as first-line treatment.

Apatinib is a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that highly selectively binds to and strongly inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2), with a decrease in VEGF-mediated endothelial cell migration, proliferation, and tumor microvascular density. A phase II trail of Apatinib has been demonstrated that Apatinib is safe to treat the metastatic colorectal cancer and the disease control rate can reach 50%.
