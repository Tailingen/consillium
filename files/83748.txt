The Diagnostic Value of Combinatory EUS and ERCP in Unclear Lesions
ERCP with brush cytology has a poor to moderate accuracy in unclear biliary lesions. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) with fine needle aspiration (FNA) for cytology may override some of these shortcomings.

The current prospective study, performed in a tertiary University center, aims to study the feasibility, the accuracy and the clinical value of combinatory ERCP and EUS in unclear biliary lesions.

PROCEDURE: Combinatory EUS and ERCP
Diagnostic accuracy, Overall accuracy of ERCP and EUS, 12 months post-EUS
Adverse event rate, The number of patients ending up with some type of complication related to ERCP or EUS, 30 days post-EUS
The eligible study participants with unclear biliary lesions referred for an ERCP to the Sahlgrenska Univeristy Hospital endoscopy unit will be subjected to ERCP with/without brush cytology followed by EUS with/without FNA.

The results of ERCP and EUS will be compared to the pathology report of surgical specimens in resected patients or to clinical follow up at 12 months post-EUS in non-resected patients.
