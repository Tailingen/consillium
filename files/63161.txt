PROCEDURE: Colon resection
Postoperative venous thromboembolic event, Deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, 60 days
The Copenhagen cOmplete Mesocolic Excision Study (COMES) database contains comprehensive data on preoperative, intraoperative, postoperative and tumor related variable on patients undergoing elective colonic cancer resection at four public university clinics providing all colorectal cancer treatment for the 1.8 million residents of the Capital Region of Denmark during the period 2014-2017.

None of these hospitals had implemented prolonged thromboembolic prophylaxis after discharge.

The medical records were reviewed with focusing on VTE prophylaxis, ongoing preoperative and postoperative anticoagulant treatment, the length of hospital stay (LOS), and readmission to ensure high data validity.
