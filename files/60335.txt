A Phase II Study of Bevacizumab + Sorafenib in Metastatic Breast Cancer
Prior clinical trials involving bevacizumab and sorafenib have demonstrated single agent activity in previously treated advanced breast cancer. This trial will test combined VEGF inhibition with sorafenib and bevacizumab in less heavily pre-treated patients with advanced breast cancer.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Sorafenib|DRUG: Bevacizumab|OTHER: Imaging
Progression-Free Survival, The primary objective was to assess the Progression-Free Survival of sorafenib combined with bevacizumab in patients with metastatic breast cancer. Progression is defined by RECIST as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters of target measurable lesions over the smallest sum observed (over baseline if no decrease during therapy) or by the appearance of a new lesion., From the start of the treatment until the criteria for disease progression is met (or death occurs) maximum of 24 months
Assess the Clinical Benefit Response: the Proportion of Patients With Clinical Benefit (CR+PR+SD > 6 Months Duration) Will be Assessed at the Completion of the Study., 6 months|Assess the Overall Response Rate., 24 months|Determine the Adverse Event Profile of Sorafenib Combined With Bevacizumab in This Patient Population., 24 months
OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.
