Ixabepilone + Carboplatin Metastatic Breast Cancer
Ixabepilone adds significantly to the antitumor effectiveness of capecitabine in both ER+ and triple negative breast cancer. Ixabepilone has substantial antitumor activity in taxane-refractory patients and novel combinations are needed in this poor prognosis population. Carboplatin in combination with gemcitabine or paclitaxel has activity in metastatic breast cancer (MBC); there is also demonstrated activity of the gemcitabine/carboplatin combination in the ER+ versus triple negative subsets. A Phase I study of ixabepilone plus carboplatin in solid tumor patients demonstrated the safety of this combination at the doses and schedule proposed for this Phase II trial (BMS data on file).

DRUG: Ixabepilone|DRUG: Carboplatin
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Evaluate the objective response rate calculated as CR+ PR in the population evaluable for response, as well as the 2 subgroups (hormone receptor positive \[ER+/PR+/HER2-, ER+/PR-/HER2-, ER-/PR+/HER2-\]) and ER-/PR-HER2-, separately).

Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., 24 months
Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), Clinical benefit rate (CBR) defined as objective response rate (ORR, CR + PR) + SD \>= 6 months, 24 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS is measured from the date of randomization to the date of first documented disease progression or date of death, whichever comes first. If a patient neither progresses nor dies, this patient will be censored at last contact date.

Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions, 24 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS is measured from the date of randomization to the date of death for a dead patient. If a patient is still alive or is lost to follow up, the patient will be censored at the last contact date., 24 months|Time to Response, For patients who achieve a major objective response (CR or PR) the time to response will be assessed as the date of registration to the date of response., 24 months|Duration of Response, The duration of response is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR/PR until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented., 30 months
This is a Phase II, open label, nonrandomized, parallel, noncomparative, study of 2 groups (as stratified below). All patients will receive ixabepilone 20 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 8 and carboplatin AUC=2.5 on Days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle. Patients will be stratified by either hormone receptor positive \[ER+/PR+/HER2-, ER+/PR-/HER2-, ER-/PR+/HER2-\]- (n=50) or triples negative ER-/PR-/HER2- (n=53). If one group fulfills their accrual goal first, registration into that strata will be stopped and only patients meeting stratification requirements for the other group will be registered.
