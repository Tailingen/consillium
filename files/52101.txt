Extension Study of Cinacalcet for Treatment of Secondary Hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in Pediatric Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease on Dialysis
The primary objective of this study was to characterize the long-term safety and tolerability of cinacalcet in pediatric patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) receiving dialysis.
Secondary Hyperparathyroidism, Chronic Kidney Disease
DRUG: Cinacalcet
Number of Participants With Adverse Events, Adverse events (AEs) were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, v4.0). The investigator assessed whether the adverse event was possibly related to the study drug as indicated by a "yes" or "no" response to the question: Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the study drug?, From first dose of study drug in the extension study up to 4 weeks after the last dose; 32 weeks.
Percentage of Participants Achieving ≥ 30% Reduction in iPTH From Baseline to Mean Value During Weeks 11 and 15, This endpoint was analyzed in participants who received SOC only in parent study 20130356.

Participants who had no iPTH values during weeks 11 or 15 were considered non-responders. Data collected more than 7 days after the last dose of study drug were excluded., Baseline (defined as the mean values of samples collected during the screening period and day 1 pre-dose in the extension study) and weeks 11 and 15|Percentage of Participants Achieving ≥ 30% Reduction in iPTH From Baseline to Mean Value During Weeks 23 and 28, This endpoint was analyzed in participants who received SOC only in parent study 20130356.

This extension study was designed to characterize the long-term safety and tolerability of cinacalcet in pediatric patients from Amgen Studies 20130356 (NCT02138838) and 20110100 (NCT01439867) who either had completed the parent study or were ongoing at the time an administrative decision was made to end the parent study. After enrolling into this study participants were administered cinacalcet for 28 weeks or until the time of renal transplant or parathyroidectomy, whichever occurred first. The treatment period was followed by a 4-week safety follow-up period.
