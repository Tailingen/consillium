A Study to Determine the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Preliminary Efficacy of ABBV-927 With ABBV-368, Budigalimab (ABBV-181) and/or Chemotherapy in Participants With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
A study evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of ABBV-927 with ABBV-368, Budigalimab (ABBV-181) and/or chemotherapy in participants with selected solid tumors. This study consists of 2 main parts, a dose-escalation phase and a dose-expansion phase. The dose-expansion phase can begin once the recommended phase 2 dose/maximum tolerated dose (RP2D/MTD) is determined in the dose-escalation phase.

Dose Expansion: Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1., Up to approximately 2 years following the first dose of study drug|Dose-Escalation Phase: Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of ABBV-927 + ABBV-368, The RP2D of ABBV-927 + ABBV-368 will be determined during the dose-escalation phase of the study. RP2D will be determined using available safety and pharmacokinetics data., Up to approximately 6 months|Dose-Escalation Phase: Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of ABBV-927 + ABBV-368 + ABBV-181, The RP2D of ABBV-927 + ABBV-368 + ABBV-181 will be determined during the dose-escalation phase of the study. RP2D will be determined using available safety and pharmacokinetics data., Up to approximately 6 months
Dose-Expansion Phase: Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from date of first study drug exposure to disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 2 years since the first dose of study drug|Dose-Expansion Phase: Duration of Response (DOR), DOR defined as the time from the participant's initial response to study drug therapy to disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 2 years since the first dose of study drug|Maximum Serum Concentration (Cmax), Maximum Serum Concentration (Cmax), Up to approximately 12 weeks after participant's initial dose of study drug|Time to Maximum Observed Serum Concentration (Tmax), Time to Maximum Observed Serum Concentration (Tmax), Up to approximately 12 weeks after participant's initial dose of study drug|Area Under the Serum Concentration Versus Time Curve from Time 0 to the Time of the Last Measurable Concentration (AUCτ), Area under the serum concentration versus time curve from time 0 to the time of the last measurable concentration (AUCτ)., Up to approximately 12 weeks after participant's initial dose of study drug|Terminal Phase Elimination Half-life (t1/2), Terminal Phase Elimination Half-life (t1/2), Up to approximately 4 weeks after participant's initial dose of study drug
