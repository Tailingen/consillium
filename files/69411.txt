ASCVD Management Using CCTA in Prostate Cancer Patients on ADT
This is a randomized pilot study of Coronary CT Angiography (CCTA) for coronary atherosclerosis vs. Usual Care in patients with prostate cancer who are either planning to begin, or are currently taking androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) .
Prostate Cancer
DEVICE: Coronary CT Angiography (CCTA)
Proportion of Atherosclerosis in CCTA Arm, Proportion of prostate cancer patients without cardiac symptoms in the CCTA arm who are reclassified into a higher risk group using automated plaque assessment from CCTA that would otherwise be classed as low risk for ASCVD using the PCE, Baseline|Proportion of Subjects Eligible for Treatment Based on Automated Plaque Assessment from CCTA, Assessment of automated plaque from CCTA determining eligibility of lipid lowering treatment and aspirin, Baseline
Reduction in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk score, Changes in risk over time with intensive medical treatment tailored to plaque burden to test results in a reduction in cardiovascular risk factors including blood pressure, glucose and lipid levels, thus reducing the ASCVD risk score., Baseline, 6 months, and 12 months
This is a randomized pilot study where subjects are randomized 1:1 to either the CCTA group or non-CCTA (usual care) group. The target enrollment will be 100 subjects with accounting for a potential 10% dropout rate resulting in an sample size between 90-100 participants or 45-50per group arm.
