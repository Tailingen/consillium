A Dose Escalation Study of ASP8273 in Subjects With Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Who Have Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Mutations
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of ASP8273 and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). This study will also determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of ASP8273, evaluate the potential inhibition of CYP3A4 by ASP8273 and the antitumor activity of ASP8273 as well as determine the effect of food on the bioavailability of ASP8273.
Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)|Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Mutations
DRUG: naquotinib|DRUG: midazolam
Safety and tolerability as assessed by Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), A DLT is defined as any pre-determined toxicity that is related to study drug per the investigator and which occurs during Cycle 0 and Cycle 1 using NCI CTCAE v4.03., up to 18 months|Safety and tolerability as assessed by adverse events (AEs), An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a study drug or has undergone study procedures and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product., up to 18 months|Safety and tolerability as assessed by laboratory tests, Laboratory tests to be conducted are hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis, coagulation profile, lipid panel and lymphocyte subpopulation., up to 18 months|Safety and tolerability as assessed by vital signs, Vital signs to be measured includes blood pressure, pulse rate and temperature., up to 18 months|Safety and tolerability as assessed by 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), up to 18 months
Composite of pharmacokinetics of ASP8273 concentration and its metabolites (plasma): Cmax, tmax, AUClast, AUCinf, t1/2, CL/F, and Vz/F, Maximum concentration (Cmax), the time after dosing when Cmax occurs (tmax), area under the concentration - time curve from time 0 up to the last quantifiable concentration (AUClast), area under the concentration - time curve from time 0 extrapolated to infinity (AUCinf), apparent terminal elimination half-life (t1/2), apparent oral systemic clearance (CL/F), Apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F), Cycle 0: Dose Escalation Days 1-2, FE Days 1-6; Cycle 1: Dose Escalation/Response Expansion/RP2D/FE Days 1,8,15, RP2D Day 21, Exon 20 Days 8,15; Cycle 2 & 3: Dose Escalation/Response Expansion/RP2D Days 1,2, FE Day 1; Exon 20 days 1, 2 & Cycle 3|Composite of pharmacokinetics of midazolam concentration and its metabolites (plasma): Cmax, tmax, AUClast, AUCinf, t1/2, CL/F, and Vz/F, Day -1 and Day 1 of cycle 1; Day 1 and Day 2 of cycle 2|Best overall response rate, Defined as proportion of subjects whose best overall response is Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) among all analyzed subjects., Up to 18 months|Disease control rate, Defined as the proportion of subjects whose best overall response is rated as CR, PR or Stable Disease (SD) among all analyzed subjects., Up to 18 months|Progression free survival, Defined as the time from the start of the study treatment until death from any cause or radiographic disease progression assessed according to RECIST 1.1, whichever occurs first., Up to 18 months
This study is composed of 2 parts: part 1 is the dose escalation phase and part 2 is the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) phase, Food Effect (FE) cohort and Exon 20 cohort.
