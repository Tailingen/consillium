Microparticle Enhanced Cytotoxic Transarterial Embolization Therapy in Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This is a non-randomized, prospective, pilot, Multicenter Study of Drug-eluting bead transarterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) using Doxorubicin-Loaded Embozene® Tandem™ Microspheres to treat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DEVICE: TANDEM™
Freedom From Serious Adverse Event (SAE) at 30days, Up to 30 days|Freedom From Study Related SAE at 6 Months, Up to 6 months|Freedom From Tumor Progression at 6 Months, Progression was assessed by the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST - Lencioni and Llovet 2010) as an increase of at least 20% in the sum of the diameters of viable (enhancing) target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of the diameters of viable (enhancing) target lesions recorded since treatment started. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5mm., 6 months
12 Month Survival, 12 months
