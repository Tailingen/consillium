Ph 2 Bortezomib, Dexamethasone, + Doxorubicin With ALCAR for Previously Treated Multiple Myeloma
Patients will receive Bortezomib, Dexamethasone, and Doxorubicin in 21 day cycles a total of 4 to 8 times (based on response to the treatment). Patients will also receive acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR) daily.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Bort, Dex, and Dox with ALCAR
Confirmed Anti-tumor Response Rate (Complete Response and Partial Response) to the Combination of Bortezomib, Dexamethasone, Doxorubicin, and ALCAR, Anti-tumor responses were analyzed descriptively and summarized in tabular format. Ninety percent confidence intervals for the percentage of subjects with a confirmed anti-tumor response were constructed using the method proposed by Duffy-Santner.

Complete response defined as: no evidence of M-protein on immunofixation of serum and/or urine AND less than 5% plasma cells in the bone marrow biopsy.

Partial response defined as: 50 to 99% decrease in M-protein on serum and/or urine protein electrophoresis., Every 21 days, up to 24 weeks
Overall Survival, From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 7 years|Progression-free Survival, Progression is defined as any of the following: 1) 25% or greater increase in M-protein as measured by serum or urine protein electrophoresis. There must be an absolute minimum increase of 0.5 g/dl in serum M spike or 0.2 gram of specific urinary light chains to constitute progression, 2) 25% or greater increase in the percentage or plasma cells in the bone marrow biopsy, or 3) new bone lesions or an increase in the size of old lesions on x-ray., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 7 years.
The primary objective of this study is to assess overall response rate to the treatment.

Secondary objectives include: evaluating and describing the incidence of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy using the FACT/GOG-Ntx assessment tool; evaluating the utility of adding ALCAR to the chemotherapy to reduce the incidence of peripheral neuropathy; and evaluating the utility of the Grooved Pegboard Completion Time as a longitudinal measure of peripheral neuropathy.
