Mechanisms of Metabolic and Hormone Action on Plaque Formation in Brain and Carotid Vessels in Patients With Prostate Adenocarcinoma
This trial studies the mechanisms of metabolic and hormone action on plaque formation in brain and carotid vessels in patients with prostate adenocarcinoma. Studying the biomarkers in the laboratory may help doctors know the impact of androgen deprivation on metabolic, brain and cardiovascular endpoints.

OUTLINE:

Patients undergo clinical evaluations over 12 months including physical exam and vital signs, waist to hip circumference, medical history and events, laboratory evaluations, imaging evaluations, cognitive function evaluations, gait assessment, and quality of life questionnaires.
