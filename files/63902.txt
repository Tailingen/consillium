Pet Imaging as a Biomarker in Hormone Refractory postmenopausaL Women
This is a prospective, single arm trial in which patients with locally advanced or metastatic endocrine receptor positive and HER2 negative breast cancer refractory to non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors (NSAI) will receive Everolimus 10mg orally daily given in conjunction with exemestane 25mg orally daily until disease progression or treatment discontinuation for any other reasons. The main objectives are to evaluate if early metabolic response (MR) using FDG-PET/CT is associated with progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in this population.

Tumour, metastatic lesions and blood samples will be collected during the treatment period in order to identify biomarkers predicting resistance to study treatment. Results will be correlated with the results of early FDG PET/CT data in order to better characterise the non-responders.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Everolimus|DRUG: Exemestane
PFS based on RECIST criteria 1.1., To evaluate if early metabolic response (MR) using FDG-PET/CT is associated with progression free survival (PFS) in ER+, HER2 negative ABC or MBC patients treated with exemestane plus everolimus., 2.5 years from FPI
Overall survival (OS), To evaluate if early metabolic response (MR) using FDG-PET/CT is associated with overall survival (OS) in ER+, HER2 negative locally advanced or MBC patients treated with exemestane plus everolimus., 2.5 years from first patient in|* Proportion of FDG-PET/CT metabolic non-responders/FDG-PET/CT metabolic responders * Estimate the most suitable second FDG-PET/CT time point (2 weeks versus 4 weeks after initiation of treatment)., FDG PET/CT will be done three times during the pilot phase of the study (first 30 patients): at baseline (at day 0, Day 14 and day 28). FDG PET/CT will be done twice during the extension phase: at baseline (at day 0, Day 14 or Day 28) depending the results of the pilot phase., Baseline, day 14, Day 28 and at progression|Biomarker Assessment, The aim is to identify biomarkers predicting resistance to exemestane and everolimus therapy by studying primary tumor, metastatic biopsies and serial plasma samples., baseline, day 14, day 28, every 12 weeks and at progression
