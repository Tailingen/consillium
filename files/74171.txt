Regorafenib in Taiwan Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (mCRC) Patients
Regorafenib is currently the standard of care for refractory mCRC patients. Pivotal studies of regorafenib have proven the efficacy and safety, with a 28-day cycle (21 days on, 7 days off) and 160 mg dose given once daily.

In the clinic, patients often have some complicated condition. This study aims to perform retrospective medical chart review of mCRC patients who received regorafenib treatment in two medical centers in Taiwan to examine treatment effectiveness in the routine clinical practice setting.
