BIBW 2992 (Afatinib) in Combination With Pemetrexed in Advanced Solid Tumours
This Phase I study will investigate the safety of BIBW 2992 in combination with standard dose pemetrexed (500mg/m2) given on a 21 day cycle in patients with advanced solid cancers. BIBW 2992 will be given on two different dose schedules; dosing on days 1-21 and dosing on days 1 to 6 of a 21 day cycle.

The use of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR TKIs), including BIBW 2992 have demonstrated efficacy in solid tumors including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In addition, pemetrexed has demonstrated efficacy and has been approved as single agent chemotherapy in second-line NSCLC patients with adenocarcinoma. The data obtained from this trial shall allow for a conclusion as to whether BIBW 2992 may be safely administered in advanced cancer patients in combination therapy with pemetrexed.

Investigator Defined Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) During First Course of Treatment, Treated Set, Occurence of DLT during the first course of treatment to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Afatinib at two different dose schedules in combination with the standard established dose of pemetrexed (500 mg/m2)., DLT were assessed during the first cycle (days 1-21)
Investigator Defined Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) During All Courses of Treatment, Treated Set, Occurence of DLT during all courses of treatment with Afatinib at two different dose schedules in combination with the standard established dose of pemetrexed (500 mg/m2)., DLT were assessed during all cycles of treatment|Objective Response (OR), Objective Response is defined as complete response or partial response according to the response evaluation criteria in solid tumours (RECIST) version 1.1.

Complete Response (CR): disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level; Partial Response (PR): at least 30% decrease of the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD): at least a 20% increase in the sum of LD of target lesions together with an absolute increase in the sum of LD of at least 5 millimeters; Stable Disease (SD): neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR, nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD., Every 6 weeks before week 48 and every 12 weeks after week 48 until progression|Disease Control, Disease Control is defined as complete response, partial response, or stable disease according to the response evaluation criteria in solid tumours (RECIST) version 1.1., Every 6 weeks before week 48 and every 12 weeks after week 48 until progression|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from the first treatment to the occurence of tumour progression or death, whichever came first. It was assessed according to RECIST version 1.1 criteria., Every 6 weeks before week 48 and every 12 weeks after week 48 until progression|Tumour Shrinkage, Tumour shrinkage is defined as the maximum percentage decrease from baseline in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions., Every 6 weeks before week 48 and every 12 weeks after week 48 until progression
