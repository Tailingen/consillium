Phase 2 Study of Temozolomide in Pre-Selected Advanced Aerodigestive Tract Cancers (Study P04273AM2)(TERMINATED)
This study is proposed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of temozolomide, an oral anti-cancer agent, in a participant population selected for a biomarker. Participants with colorectal cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer, head and neck cancer, or esophageal cancer will be included.
Colorectal Neoplasm|Head and Neck Neoplasm|Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung|Esophageal Neoplasm
DRUG: Temozolomide
Tumor Responses (Complete and Partial Response), Tumor response rate was based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).

Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions.

Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD., From start of treatment until participant's disease progression, intolerable toxicity or death, which ever comes first
