CD19-CAR-T2 Cells for CD19 Positive B Cell Malignancies
Chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T cells) has been recognized a promising treatment option for treating B cell derived malignancy. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of third-generation anti-CD19 CAR T-cells (CD19-CAR-T2 Cells) in patients with CD19+ relapsed or refractory (r/r) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and B-cell Non Hodgkin Lymphoma (B-NHL).

ORR, Overall Response Rate includes Complete Remission (CR) and Complete Remission with Incomplete Blood Count Recovery (CRi), as determined by assessments of peripheral blood, bone marrow, CNS symptoms, physical exam (PE) and CSF. The primary endpoint will be based on the IRC assessment. The local investigator's assessed results will be used for sensitivity analysis., 3 months
