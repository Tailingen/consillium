Local Recurrence Due to Rectal Cancer in Sweden
The aim of this retrospective national registry study is to validate the reporting of local recurrence in the registry. Another aim is to identify preoperative risk factors for local recurrence. This can in turn indicate the need for a more intense follow-up. The treatment of local recurrence, including the impact of the multidisciplinary team conference (MDT) and the surgical procedure and the referral pathways of local recurrences will also be determined.

We aim to evaluate treatment outcome after local recurrence for patients operated or treated between 2007-2018.
