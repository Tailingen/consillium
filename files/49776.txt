Melanoma
DRUG: Ipilimumab|DRUG: Nivolumab
Intracranial Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), Intracranial Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) is defined as the percentage of all treated participants whose best overall response is either a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) or whose best overall response was Stable Disease (SD) with duration of \>6 months, as determined by modified RECIST 1.1 criteria for index intracranial lesions based on investigator review., Up to 66 months
Intracranial Objective Response Rate (ORR), Investigator-Assessed Intracranial Objective Response Rate (ORR) per modified RECIST 1.1 criteria is defined as the number of participants who achieve a best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) divided by the number of treated participants., Up to 66 months|Intracranial Progression Free Survival (PFS), Intracranial progression-free survival (PFS) per modified RECIST 1.1 criteria is defined as the time between the date of first dose of study drug and the first date of documented progression, as determined by the investigator, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Participant who die without a reported progression will be considered to have progressed on the date of their death. Participants who did not progress or die will be censored on the date of their last evaluable tumor assessment. Participants who did not have any on study tumor assessments and did not die will be censored on the date of first dose of study drug. Participants who started anti-cancer therapy without a prior reported progression will be censored on the date of their last evaluable tumor assessment prior to the initiation of subsequent anti-cancer therapy., Up to 66 months|Extracranial Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), Extracranial Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) is defined as the percentage of all treated participants whose best overall response is either a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) or whose best overall response was Stable Disease (SD) with duration of \>6 months, as determined by RECIST 1.1 criteria for index extracranial lesions based on investigator review., Up to 66 months|Extracranial Objective Response Rate (ORR), Extracranial Objective Response Rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1 criteria is defined as the number of participants who achieve a best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) divided by the number of treated participants., Up to 66 months|Extracranial Progression Free Survival (PFS), Extracranial progression-free survival (PFS) per RECIST 1.1 criteria is defined as the time between the date of first dose of study drug and the first date of documented progression, as determined by the investigator, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Participant who die without a reported progression will be considered to have progressed on the date of their death. Participants who did not progress or die will be censored on the date of their last evaluable tumor assessment. Participants who did not have any on study tumor assessments and did not die will be censored on the date of first dose of study drug. Participants who started anti-cancer therapy without a prior reported progression will be censored on the date of their last evaluable tumor assessment prior to the initiation of subsequent anti-cancer therapy., Up to 66 months|Global Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), Investigator-assessed global (intracranial + extracranial) clinical benefit rate (CBR) per a combination of modified RECIST 1.1 criteria for intracranial lesions and RECIST 1.1 for extracranial disease is defined as the percentage of all treated participants whose best overall response is either a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) or whose best overall response was Stable Disease (SD) with duration of \>6 months, Up to 66 months|Global Objective Response Rate (ORR), Investigator-assessed global objective response rate (ORR) per a combination of modified RECIST 1.1 criteria for intracranial lesions and RECIST 1.1 for extracranial disease is defined as the number of participants who achieve a best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) divided by the number of treated participants., Up to 66 months|Global Progression Free Survival (PFS), Investigator-assessed global progression free survival (PFS) per a combination of modified RECIST 1.1 criteria for intracranial lesions and RECIST 1.1 for extracranial disease is defined as the time between the date of first dose of study drug and the first date of documented progression, as determined by the investigator, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Participant who die without a reported progression will be considered to have progressed on the date of their death. Participants who did not progress or die will be censored on the date of their last evaluable tumor assessment. Participants who did not have any on study tumor assessments and did not die will be censored on the date of first dose of study drug. Participants who started anti-cancer therapy without a prior reported progression will be censored on the date of their last evaluable tumor assessment prior to the initiation of subsequent anti-cancer therapy., Up to 66 months|Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from the date of the start of treatment until the date of death. For participants who have not died, OS will be censored at the recorded last date of participant contact, and participants with a missing recorded last date of contact will be censored at the last date the participant was known to be alive., Up to 66 months|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), Number of participants with any grade of adverse events (AEs) and any grade of serious adverse events (SAEs) graded by National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.0), From first dose to 30 days post last dose (Up to 66 months)|Number of Participants Deaths, Number of participants who died due to any cause., Up to 66 months|Number of Participants With Laboratory Abnormalities in Specific Liver Tests, Number of participants with laboratory abnormalities in specific liver tests based on US conventional units to determine the safety and tolerability of Nivolumab and Daratumumab. The number of participants with the following laboratory abnormalities from on-treatment evaluations will be summarized:

* ALT or AST \> 3 x ULN, \> 5 x ULN, \> 10 x ULN and \> 20 x ULN
* Total bilirubin \> 2 x ULN
* Concurrent (within 1 day) ALT or AST \> 3 x ULN and total bilirubin \> 2 x ULN
* Concurrent (within 30 days) ALT or AST \> 3 x ULN and total bilirubin \> 2 x ULN, From first dose to 30 days post last dose (Up to 66 months)|Number of Participants With Laboratory Abnormalities in Specific Thyroid Tests, Number of participants with laboratory abnormalities in specific thyroid tests based on US conventional units to determine the safety and tolerability of Nivolumab and Daratumumab. The number of subjects with the following laboratory abnormalities from on-treatment evaluations will be summarized:

* TSH value \> ULN and
* with baseline TSH value \<= ULN
* with at least one FT3/FT4 test value \< LLN within 2-week window after the abnormal TSH test
* with all FT3/FT4 test values \>= LLN within 2-week window after the abnormal TSH test
* with FT3/FT4 missing within 2-week window after the abnormal TSH test.
* TSH \< LLN and
* with baseline TSH value \>= LLN
* with at least one FT3/FT4 test value \> ULN within 2-week window after the abnormal TSH test
