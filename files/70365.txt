Predicting Response Patterns to Treatment in Glioblastoma (GBM) Patients
PROPHETIC GBM - Predicting response patterns to treatment in Glioblastoma (GBM) oncology patients based on host response evaluation during anti-cancer treatments
Glioblastoma

The goal of this research study is identify new host response proteins, pathways and mechanisms that are associated with responsiveness to GBM treatment modalities.

This will serve as a tool for physicians when making treatment decisions. The investigators also aim to identify the metabolic pathways that could lead to better therapeutic options. The patients will be given their treatment according to the institute's standard of care. The patients will provide up to 5 blood samples and clinical data will be collected from their medical records.

The data obtained from the blood samples and the medical records of the patients will be used to search for potential mechanisms that are involved in response to treatment, and to identify potential targets to increase the response, and hence, increase treatment effectiveness or suggest potential new treatments.
