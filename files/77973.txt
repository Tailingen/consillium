Development of a Nanosecond Pulsed Electric Field System to Treat Skin Cancer
Human Basal Cell Carcinomas (BCCs) can be ablated by treating them with nanosecond pulsed electric fields (nsPEF)
Basal Cell Carcinomas
DEVICE: PulseCure pulse generator and Derm-pulse electrode
Demonstrate the safety of PulseCure pulse generator and NanoBlate electrode and identify the optimal pulse number for treating basal cell carcinomas., 1. Conduct a non-significant risk feasibility clinical trial treating BCCs on the trunk of up to 9 Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome patients with BioElectroMed's PulseCure pulse generator and Derm-Pulse electrode to both demonstrate the safety of nsPEF therapy and identify the optimal pulse number for ablating BCCs., One year
Determine the efficacy of the PulseCure pulse generator using the optimal pulse number., 2. Conduct a non-significant risk Pilot Clinical Trial treating BCCs on the trunk of 20 patients with sporadic BCCs using the optimal pulse number determined from the feasibility trial to assess the efficacy of this technique., one year
The purpose of this study is to determine if low energy, non-thermal, 100 ns pulses can ablate BCCs. The investigators consider this a non-significant risk study because our PulseCure system only applies 0.4 watts to the skin compared to the 40 watts applied by the currently used electrosurgical unit to remove skin lesions, the Hyfrecator. Since the PulseCure applies 1/100 of the energy and does not even heat the skin significantly, it represents a non-significant risk to the patient. Our study will provide the first data on the response of BCCs to these 100 ns pulses. The investigators will first treat three BCCs on BCNS patients with different pulse numbers to determine the pulse number needed to ablate. Once the investigators have the optimal pulse number, the investigators will use it to treat 20 normal patients with sporadic BCCs on their trunks. This should provide sufficient data to conclude whether or not nsPEF can ablate BCCs on normal individuals.
