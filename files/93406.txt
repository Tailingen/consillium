Five Year Study to Track Use of DecisionDX-Melanoma Test in Patients With Cutaneous Melanoma and Associated Patient Outcomes
The EXPAND Registry Study follows patients with cutaneous melanoma who have had the DecisionDx-Melanoma gene expression assay performed as part of their clinical care. Data will be collected through review of medical records from clinical visits with physician.

The purpose is to document the clinical application of results obtained from the DecisionDx- Melanoma multi-gene assay and to track outcomes of patients for whom DecisionDx-Melanoma testing has been completed. Additionally the study will assess the health economic impact of DecisionDx-Melanoma testing as it relates to the Melanoma population.
Cutaneous Melanoma
Adjusted surveillance regimen, * Relaxed surveillance for the low risk group;
* Increased vigilance for early detection in the high risk group., upon receipt DecisionDX-Melanoma results received and every 6 months thereafter
Referral for sentinel lymph node interrogation in the high risk group in thin melanomas., Upon receipt DecisionDx-Melanoma results
Early referral to medical oncologist for high risk patients., Upon Receipt DecisionDx-Melanoma results
