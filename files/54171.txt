Number of Breasts With Successful Tissue Expansion With Exchange to a Permanent Breast Implant Unless Exchange is Precluded by a Non-device Related Event, The primary endpoint is analyzed per breast. Breasts in which the expander is removed and/or replaced due to a device related adverse event or a device malfunction are counted as failures., 6 months
Number of Breast With Successful Tissue Expansion With Exchange to Permanent Implant Including All Breasts in the Per Protocol Cohort., Secondary analysis is repeated including all breasts in the PP cohort (including non-device related failures). The Treatment Success Rate by breast, based on the Per Protocol cohort, including all cause failures, is 95.2% (80/84). One subject (2 breasts) are not included in the analyses due to not completing the second stage surgery and withdrawal of consent., 6 months
