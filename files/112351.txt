Durvalumab With Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) vs Placebo With SBRT in Early Stage Unresected Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Patients/ Osimertinib Following SBRT in Patients With Early Stage Unresected NSCLC Harboring an EGFR Mutation
This is a Phase III, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multi-center study assessing the efficacy and safety of durvalumab with SoC SBRT versus placebo with SoC SBRT in patients with unresected clinical Stage I/II lymph node-negative (T1 to T3N0M0) NSCLC.

An additional cohort will assess Osimertinib following SBRT in patients with early stage unresected T1 to T3N0M0 NSCLC harbouring an EGFR mutation.

Patients with Stage I/II lymph node negative NSCLC and confirmed to meet all eligibility criteria will be randomized 1:1 to receive either Durvalumab + SoC SBRT or placebo + SoC SBRT.

The primary objective of main cohort is to assess the efficacy of Durvalumab with SoC SBRT compared to placebo with SoC SBRT in terms of PFS. Key secondary is to assess the efficacy of Durvalumab with SoC SBRT compared to placebo with SoC SBRT in terms of Overall Survival (OS).

In addition, a study cohort with a sufficient number of patients harboring an EGFR-TKI sensitizing mutation, will receive Osimertinib treatment after completion of SoC SBRT as definitive treatment of Stage I/II lymph node-negative NSCLC. The primary objective of Osimertinib cohort is to assess efficacy of Osimertinib following SoC SBRT in terms of 4-year PFS. Key secondary objectives include safety, OS and efficacy of Osimertininb treatment with SBRT.
