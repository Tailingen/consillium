Adjuvant Treatment for High-risk Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients With the Anti-PD-l1 Antibody Avelumab
Phase III randomized trial of the anti-PD-L1 antibody avelumab as adjuvant or post-neoadjuvant treatment for high-risk triple negative breast cancer patients. The overall protocol-defined patient population will include the following two strata of patients:

* Stratum A - Patients who have completed treatment with curative intent including surgery of the primary tumor followed by adjuvant chemotherapy .
* Stratum B - Patients who have completed treatment with curative intent including neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery of the primary tumor and (if indicated) further adjuvant chemotherapy.

Disease free survival, DFS is defined as the time from randomization to locoregional invasive recurrence, second primary invasive breast cancer, other second primary cancer (excluding in-situ cancers), distant metastasis or death from any cause., Up to 5 years after randomization|Disease free survival in PD-L1-positive patients, DFS is defined as the time from randomization to locoregional invasive recurrence, second primary invasive breast cancer, other second primary cancer (excluding in-situ cancers), distant metastasis or death from any cause., Up to 5 years after randomization
Overall survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause, Up to 5 years after randomization|Safety profile, Toxicity will be assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI -CTCAE), version 4., From Baseline up to 5 years after randomization
* to determine whether 1 year of adjuvant Avelumab improves disease-free survival (DFS) compared to observation in patients with high-risk primary triple negative breast cancer who have completed treatment with curative intent including surgery of the primary tumor and neo- or adjuvant chemotherapy (Stratum A \[surgery of the primary tumor followed by adjuvant chemotherapy\] and Stratum B \[neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery\] combined).
* to determine whether 1 year of adjuvant Avelumab improves disease-free survival (DFS) compared to observation in patients with high-risk primary triple negative breast cancer who have completed treatment with curative intent including neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery (Stratum B).
* to determine whether Avelumab improves overall survival (OS) compared to observation in patients with high-risk primary triple negative breast cancer who have completed treatment with curative intent including surgery of the primary tumor and neo- or adjuvant chemotherapy.
* to determine whether 1 year of adjuvant Avelumab improves disease-free survival (DFS) compared to observation in PD-L1-positive (as determined by a companion diagnostic test under development) patients with high-risk primary triple negative breast cancer who have completed treatment with curative intent including surgery of the primary tumor and neo- or adjuvant chemotherapy.
