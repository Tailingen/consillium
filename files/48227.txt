Feasibility, test optimization, algorithm, and cut off ranges for the Mainz Biomed Colorectal Cancer Screening Test., Test results will be used for the feasibility, test optimization, algorithm, and cut- off ranges for the Mainz Biomed Colorectal Cancer Screening Test., 3 years
The primary objectives of this study are:

1. Feasibility and test optimization for the Mainz Biomed Colorectal Cancer Screening Test.
2. To develop the test algorithm and establish the clinical cut-off values for the Mainz Biomed Colorectal Cancer Screening Test.

Each enrolled participant will be asked to provide a stool sample. The stool sample will be shipped to a laboratory and tested. No results will be provided to the site or the participant.
