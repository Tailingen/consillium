Phase 2 Trial of Selinexor (KPT-330) for Metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC)
The main purpose of this study is to see whether the combination of selinexor (KPT-330) can help people with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Researchers also want to study the safety and tolerability of Selinexor in TNBC patients.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Selinexor
Clinical Benefit Rate, Complete Response (CR) + Partial Response (PR) + Stable Disease (SD) â‰¥ 12 weeks of selinexor in patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. CR: Disappearance of all target lesions; PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD; Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions; SD: Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started., Up to 10 months
Best Overall Response (OR), The best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). The patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria., Up to 10 months|Duration of Overall Response, The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started) or death. The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively documented or death., Up to 10 months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Median time to progression. Progression-free survival is defined as time elapsed from the beginning of study treatment to the first documentation of radiologic progression as defined by standard RECIST criteria or death., Up to 10 months|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival, defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause., End of post-treatment 12 month follow-up, up to 24 months per participant
