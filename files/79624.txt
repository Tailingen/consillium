TRAIL Study: Feasibility and Pilot
This is a pilot study to compare two ways of managing newly identified thyroid nodules that are likely to be cancerous based on ultrasound result and which under usual care would undergo immediate biopsy.

The main goals of this pilot study are 1) compare anxiety at 6 months in each treatment arm using the validated instrument Anxiety-CA, 2) measure thyroid quality of life in each treatment arm

Participants will be randomized to one of two groups:

1. immediate biopsy (usual care)
2. Active monitoring (serial ultrasound based monitoring and close clinical follow-up)
Thyroid Nodule|Thyroid Neoplasms|Thyroid Cancer
PROCEDURE: Biopsy|PROCEDURE: Active Monitoring
Rate of Anxiety at 6 months, Rate of anxiety will be measured using Anxiety-CA instrument PROMIS-Anxiety Short form. Each question has five response options ranging in value from one to five. (1 = never experiencing a type of distressing emotion; 5 = always feeling that emotion). To find the total raw score for a short form with all questions answered, sum the values of the response to each question. For the adult PROMIS Anxiety 7a short form, a raw score of 10 converts to a T-score of 46.7 with a standard error (SE) of 2.6., 6 months after randomization
Representativeness of enrolled participants compared to eligible participants, Representativeness will be compared in terms of age in years (continuous), biological male or female (categorical), and race/ethnicity (categorical)., 6 months after randomization.|Study Procedure compliance, Rate of completion of patient reported outcomes and number of participants who withdraw from study or are lost to follow-up., 6 months after randomization|Clinical outcomes: needle biopsy cytology results (if done),, A needle biopsy is a procedure to obtain samples of tissue or cells from thyroid nodule or lymph nodes to reveal whether a nodule is a benign tumor or cancer. Bethesda classification (ordinal) will be used. The Bethesda system identifies six diagnostic categories on thyroid nodule cytopathology. Each category is linked to a malignancy risk. Categories are as follows: Category I (Nondiagnostic), Category II (Benign), Category III (Atypical of undetermined significance), Category IV (Suspicious for follicular neoplasm), Category V (suspicious for malignancy), Category VI (Malignant). If Cytology results shows Bethesda V or VI, then histology (categorical) will be performed., 6 months after randomization.|Clinical outcomes: pathology at surgery (if surgery performed),, Histologic examination (Categorical) will be performed to make diagnosis. Histology is a medical practice to review tissues under microscope to identify potential changes in a suspected tissue. The histological exam will help to diagnose if cancer is present or not and to find out the histologic type of the suspected tissue. The histologic types for thyroid cancer are as follows: Papillary, follicular, oncocytic, medullary, and anaplastic., 6 months after randomization.|Clinical outcomes; Nodule size, If patient is on active monitoring, then the nodule size will be followed with ultrasound exams., Baseline and 6 months after randomization.|Score on selected domains of the ThyPRO short form instrument, The ThyPRO survey is a quality-of-life measure designed to evaluate how thyroid disease has affected the participant's life. Domains being used from this measure for the pilot study include symptoms (8 items), tiredness (2 items), and memory and concentration (3 items). Answer choices range from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much) with higher scores indicating worse quality of life., 3 and 6 months post randomization
