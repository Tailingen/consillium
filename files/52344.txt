Trial Assessing Roux-en-Y Anastomosis of the Pancreatic Stump to Prevent Pancreatic Fistula Following Distal Pancreatectomy
The objective is to clarify Roux-en-Y anastomosis of the pancreatic stump decreases pancreatic fistula following distal pancreatectomy, compared with stapling closure of the pancreatic stump.

The objective of this study was to clarify Roux-en-Y anastomosis of the pancreatic stump prevents pancreatic fistula after distal pancreatectomy (DP) compared to stapling closure of the pancreatic stump in a prospective randomized controlled trail.

Various methods and technique for treating surgical stump of the remnant pancreas have been reported to reduce pancreatic fistula after DP. However, appropriate surgical stump closure after DP is still controversial.

The primary endpoint in this trial was defined as the incidence of pancreatic fistula .
