The Efficacy of 5-fluorouracil/Mitomycin for the Patients With Pulmonary Metastasis of Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of 5-fluorouracil + Mitomycin for the patients with pulmonary metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma who had progressive disease with sorafenib.

Extrahepatic metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma has recently been paradoxically increasing due to increased survival with effective locoregional therapies. Sorafenib is the first systemic agent that has demonstrated a significant survival benefit in patients with advanced HCC; however, the modest improvement of 3 months is far from satisfactory. There is no convincing evidence, to date, that systemic chemotherapy when tumor progresses after sorafenib therapy improves overall survival. The combination of anticancer agents is important to achieve favourable clinical results. For patients with metastatic liver cancer or HCC, some studies have discussed the effectiveness of 5-fluorouracil/mitomycin(FM). However, few studies have examined the actual FM regimen for HCC.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of 5-fluorouracil/mitomycin for the patients with pulmonary metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma who had progressive disease with sorafenib.
