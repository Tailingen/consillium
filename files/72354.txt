Randomized Trial Comparing Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy to Microwave Ablation for the Treatment of Localized Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This is a randomized phase II study comparing microwave ablation (MWA) and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for localized hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

This trial will be the first prospective comparison of these modalities for the treatment of HCC and will provide critical information regarding which local ablative modality is most appropriate for which patients. This study will also provide important information regarding quality of life and liver function changes following these two different treatment modalities.

Time to local tumor progression, The primary outcome of this trial is to prospectively determine local control rates in patients with HCC treated with MWA or SBRT. Freedom From Local Progression (FFLP) is defined as the time from randomization to local tumor progression. Tumors falling to group PD (progressive disease) would constitute local control failures. Progressive disease will be defined as at least a 20% increase in the LD (longest diameter) of target lesion, taking as reference the smallest LD recorded. Or at least a 20% increase in viable arterial enhancing disease, taking as reference the smallest LD of viable HCC since treatment started. Increases of less than 3 mm compared to the smallest LD recorded will be considered stable disease rather than PD., Patients will be followed up to 2 years
Incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) and hepatobiliary toxicity, The number of patients experiencing grade 3 or higher GI or hepatobiliary toxicity by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0., Patients will be followed up to 2 years|Incidence of liver function worsening, The number of patients experiencing a 2 point or more increase in Child-Pugh score and an increase in albumin-bilirubin score of at least 0.5., Patients will be followed up to 2 years|Change in FACT- Hep questionnaire score, The FACT-Hep questionnaire is used to measure health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with hepatobiliary cancers. They are asked questions about their physical, social, emotional and functional well-being and asked to provide a score between 0 and 4 where 0 represents not at all and 4 represents very much., Questionnaires will be administered pre-treatment, post-treatment, and at 1, 3 ,6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 months post-treatment|Overall survival time, Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause. Patients who are alive at last follow-up will be censored on that date., Patients will be followed up to 2 years|Progression free survival time, Progression Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the minimum time to death or any progression., Patients will be followed up to 2 years|Metastasis free survival time, Metastasis-free survival (MFS) is defined as the minimum time to development of metastases or death, whichever occurs first., Patients will be followed up to 2 years|Incidence of intrahepatic failure, Intrahepatic failure will include progression of the treated lesion(s) as well as development of other new liver lesions., Patients will be followed up to 2 years
