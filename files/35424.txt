This study is an open-label, non-randomized dose escalation and expansion study of the LSD inhibitor SP-2577 in combination with the anti PD- 1 antibody pembrolizumab in patients with advanced, recurrent small cell ovarian cancer of the hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT) as well as select additional ovarian and endometrial cancers with mutations in the genes within the SWI/SNF pathway (Ovarian Clear Cell Cancers (OCCC), Endometrioid Ovarian Cancers (EOC) and Endometrioid Endometrial Cancers (EEC).
