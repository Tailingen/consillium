Study of Disitamab Vedotin and Anlotinib in Patients With HR-Negative, HER2-Low-Expressing Metastatic Breast Cancer
Disitamab Vedotin (RC48) contains the novel humanized anti-HER2 antibody conjugated to monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) via a cleavable linker , which is the first ADC drug that was independently developed by Rongchang Biology .The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of RC48 in Combination with Anlotinib for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer with HR negativity and HER2 low expression.
