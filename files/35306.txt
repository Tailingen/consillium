This study aims on the combinatorial results of cytology, histopathology and microbiology obatined by EBUS-TBNA for unselected mediastina lesions.
Mediastinal Lymphadenopathy|Lung Cancer
Diagnostic rate, Participant will be followed within an average of three months
A number of studies have proved EBUS-TBNA to be useful for lymph node staging in lung cancer. The diagnostic performance is equivalent to mediastinoscopy while the invasiveness is far less. This study primarily focusing on merged approach of cytology, histopathology and microbioloogy obatined by EBUS-TBNA for unselected mediastina lesions.
