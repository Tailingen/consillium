Safety and Efficacy of CD19 and CD22 Targeted CAR-T Therapy for Relapsed/Refractory B Cell Leukemia and Lymphoma
This is a single arm study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CD19 and CD22 targeted CAR-T cells therapy for patients with relapsed/refractory B Cell Leukemia and Lymphoma.
Leukemia, B-cell|Lymphoma, B-Cell
BIOLOGICAL: CD19 and CD22 targeted CAR-T cells
Adverse events that related to treatment, Therapy-related adverse events will be recorded and assessed according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, Version 5.0)., 2 years|The response rate of CD19 and CD22 CAR-T treatment in patients with relapse/refractory B Cell Leukemia and Lymphoma, The response rate of CD19 and CD22 CAR-T treatment will be recorded and assessed according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Guideline., 6 months
Rate of CD19 and CD22 CAR-T cells in bone marrow and peripheral blood, In vivo (bone marrow and peripheral blood) rate of CD19 and CD22 CAR-T cells were determined by means of flow cytometry, 2 years|Quantity of CD19 and CD22 CAR copies in bone marrow and peripheral blood, In vivo (bone marrow and peripheral blood) quantity of CD19 and CD22 CAR copies were determined by means of qPCR, 2 years|Cellular kinetics of CD19 and CD22 positive cells in Bone marrow, In vivo (bone marrow) rate and quantity of CD19 and CD22 positive cells were determined by means of flow cytometry, 1 years|Levels of IL-6 in Serum, In vivo (Serum) quantity of IL-6, 3 months|Levels of IL-10 in Serum, In vivo (Serum) quantity of IL-10, 3 months|Levels of TNF-α in Serum, In vivo (Serum) quantity of TNF-α, 3 months|Levels of CRP in Serum, In vivo (Serum) quantity of CRP, 3 months|Duration of Response (DOR) of CD19 and CD22 CAR-T treatment in patients with refractory/relapsed B Cell Leukemia and Lymphoma, DOR will be assessed from the first assessment of CR/CRi to the first assessment of recurrence or progression of the disease or death from any cause (censored), 2 years|Progress-free survival(PFS) of CD19 and CD22 CAR-T treatment in patients with refractory/relapsed B Cell Leukemia and Lymphoma, PFS will be assessed from the first CAR-T cell infusion to death from any cause or the first assessment of progression (censored)., 2 years|Overall survival(OS) of CD19 and CD22 CAR-T treatment in patients with refractory/relapsed B Cell Leukemia and Lymphoma, OS will be assessed from the first CAR-T cell infusion to death from any cause (censored), 2 years
Although the CD19 targeted CAR-T cell therapies have gained significant results in patients with relapsed and refractory B-cell Leukemia and Lymphoma. There are patients who resisted anti-CD19 CAR-T cells or with CD19 negative relapse. To make further improvement, We launch such a clinical trial using CD19 and CD22 targeted CAR-T cells for patients with relapsed and refractory B Cell Leukemia and Lymphoma to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CD19 and CD22 targeted CAR-T cell therapy.
