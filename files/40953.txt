Protecting Young Special Risk Females From Cervical Cancer Through Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) Vaccination
A research project is currently being undertaken looking at Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccination in special risk groups. It aims to see if young women with a chronic illness respond well to the HPV vaccine or whether they may require additional doses to ensure protective immunity. The four valent HPV vaccine protects against HPV types 16 \& 18, cervical cancer and HPV types 6 \& 11, anogenital warts.

The six special risk groups include:

Paediatric Rheumatological Disease Inflammatory Bowel Disease Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia Solid Organ Transplant Recipients (kidney and liver) Chronic Renal Disease Bone Marrow Transplants This immunity is measured by antibody levels of the HPV types, which requires a single blood test one month after the final dose of HPV vaccine.

This is compared to healthy controls using antibody response to HPV vaccine. This will assess directly whether these special risk groups respond as well to the HPV vaccine.
Cervical Cancer
DRUG: Licensed quadrivalent HPV vaccine, Gardasil
Determine the HPV vaccine immunogenicity in females 12-26 years with six special risk groups at one month post the third and final HPV vaccination. Blood analysis taken at one month post third and final HPV vaccine to assess immunogenicity., One Month post HPV vaccination
Describe the safety of the HPV vaccine in the six study groups using self reports and liaison with treating sub specialist team., One month post third HPV vaccination
