Trial of Nivolumab and Cetuximab After Chemoradiation in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Patients.
This is a phase II, open label, two-centered study for evaluation of the addition of nivolumab and cetuximab after chemoradiation as a neoadjuvant treatment for locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients. Subjects must have received no prior treatment for esophageal cancer (chemotherapy, radiotherapy or surgery) and no prior treatment with checkpoint inhibitors.

Eligible subjects will receive induction chemotherapy with cetuximab for a period of 4 weeks, chemoradiation with cetuximab for a period of 6 weeks, 3 cycles of immunotherapy (nivolumab + cetuximab) for a period of 6 weeks, and will undergo surgery at the end of the treatment.
Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: 5-FU|RADIATION: Radiation therapy|DRUG: Cetuximab|DRUG: Nivolumab
pathological complete response (pCR) rate, pCR is defined when no tumor is found on pathology review of the surgical specimen (TRG -0), Time from start of neoadjuvant treatment until surgical resection, assessed up to 36 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS will be censored in patients without loco-regional failure, metastatic recurrence or death, at the last date known to be alive or at the start of a new anti-cancer treatment, whatever occurs first. PFS rate will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, The time interval from the first day of treatment to the first event of loco-regional failure, metastatic recurrence or death from any cause, assessed up to 66 months|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (Safety), Treatment-emergent AEs will be graded according to NCI CTCAE v5.0, vital signs and clinical laboratory, Time from screening until the end of study drug administration, assessed up to 36 months
Overall survival (OS), Patients who are still alive when last traced will be censored at the date of last follow-up. OS rate will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, The time interval between the first day of treatment and the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 96 months
