The Role of Genetic Factors in the Development of Breast Cancer in the Kazakh Population
This is a GWAS study that aims to identify possible candidate genes associate to breast cancer by exploring single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in a group of breast cancer, in the Kazakh population. The investigators hypothesize that the careful phenotyping of the subject sand matching with increase the power to find SNP significantly associate with breast cancer

A genome-wide association study (GWAS) is an approach used in genetics research to associate specific genetic variations with particular diseases. The method involves scanning the genomes from many different people and looking for genetic markers that can be used to predict the presence of a disease. Once such genetic markers are identified, they can be used to understand how genes contribute to the disease and develop better prevention and treatment strategies.
