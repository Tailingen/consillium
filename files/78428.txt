Oncologic Risk of Rectal Preservation Against Medical Advice After Chemoradiotherapy for Rectal Cancer
Though refusal of radical surgery was often happened in rectal cancer patient after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, little is currently known about the actual oncologic outcome of it. Thus the investigators designed this study to compare the oncologic outcome of unintended rectal preservation with intended rectal preservation by surgeon.
Rectal Cancer|Chemoradiation
3-year overall survival, Overall survival rate at 3-year after completion of chemoradiotherapy, from date of completion of chemoradiotherapy until the date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed at 31th December 2017 by checking expire date of a resident registration number
The investigators identified patients whose organ were preserved by non-operative management or local excision after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for mid to low rectal cancer. Then, the patients were categorized into two groups according to the agreement on omitting radical surgery (rectal preservation). When treatment decision was agreed by their surgeon, the patients were categorized as intended rectal preservation. When there was disagreement by surgeon on rectal preservation, then the patients categorized as unintended rectal preservation. Oncologic outcome was compared between two groups.
