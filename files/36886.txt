Study of LY3410738 Administered to Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors With IDH1 or IDH2 Mutations
This is an open-label, multicenter Phase 1 study to evaluate safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of oral LY3410738 in patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) arginine 132 (R132)-mutant advanced solid tumors, including but not limited to cholangiocarcinoma, chondrosarcoma, and glioma or isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) arginine 140 (R140) or arginine 172 (R172) mutant cholangiocarcinoma.

This is an open-label, multicenter Phase 1 study to evaluate safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of oral LY3410738 in patients with IDH1 R132-mutant advanced solid tumors, including but not limited to cholangiocarcinoma, chondrosarcoma, and glioma or IDH2 R140 or R172 mutant cholangiocarcinoma.

This study includes 2 parts: Phase 1 dose escalation and Phase 1 dose expansion. The Phase 1 dose escalation monotherapy cohort will enroll any eligible patient with IDH1 R132-mutant advanced solid tumor or IDH1 or IDH2 mutant cholangiocarcinoma. The Phase 1 dose expansion will include 5 cohorts to further evaluate safety and clinical activity. Three cohorts will be administered LY3410738 monotherapy. The fourth cohort will administer LY3410738 at or below the monotherapy RP2D in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin. The fifth cohort (US only) will administer LY3410738 at or below the monotherapy RP2D in combination with durvalumab.

IDH1 R132, IDH2 R140, or IDH2 R172 mutations will be identified through genomic testing utilizing material collected prior to patient consent. Molecular assays utilized for enrollment are required to be performed in CLIA, ISO/IEC, CAP, or other similarly certified laboratory. Enrollment of patients with cholangiocarcinoma, chondrosarcoma or glioma may be made based on molecular tests performed in either tumor or blood. Enrollment of patients with other tumor types is limited to testing performed in tumor tissue.
