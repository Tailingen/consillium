Assessing Uterine Ultrasound Done as a Diagnostic Tool for the Depth of Carcinoma Invasion
In this study the investigators aim to assess the diagnostic performance of intraoperative, ultrasonographic assessment of the surgical extracted uterus for determining myometrial invasion's depth in comparison to preoperative ultrasound, intraoperative gross inspection and final pathological report (gold standard). The investigators hope that intraoperative gross inspection of the extracted uterus might offer an additional intraoperative tool for assessing the need for pelvic lymphadenectomy in early stage of endometrial cancer at least as good as pathological exam.
Endometrial Endometroid Carcinoma
DEVICE: Intraoperative ultrasound
Tumor invasion, Tumor invasion (in millimeters and in percentage of myometrial size) as assessed by ultrasound in comparison to macroscopic assesment during surgery and to final pathological report), Average of 2 weeks (immediate assessment by ultrasound, average of 2 weeks for final pathological report)
