Study of Carfilzomib, Lenalidomide, Dexamethasone and Belantamab Mafodotin in Multiple Myeloma
This research study is being done to learn if the study drug belantamab mafodotin, in combination with other standard medications, can improve multiple myeloma. This study will also help determine what effects, good and/or bad, this combination of study drugs have on subjects and their cancer, and to evaluate the overall response to this study treatment combination.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Carfilzomib, Lenalidomide, Dexamethasone, Belantamab Mafodotin
Establish Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), DLTs will be determined for each subject enrolled in Phase I as a binary variable indicating whether the subject experienced a DLT during Cycle 1 of belantamab mafodotin-containing protocol directed induction therapy., time to complete Cycle 1 (28 days)|Evaluate Complete Response (CR), CR will be determined for each subject as a binary variable indicating whether the achieved a best overall response to induction therapy of CR or better., up to 5 years
Complete Response (CR), CR will be determined for each subject as a binary variable indicating whether the achieved a best overall response to induction therapy of CR or better, Up to 5 years|Best Response, The best overall response will be determined as an ordered categorial variable indicating the subject's best response at any point along the treatment continuum., Up to 5 years|Very Good Partial Response (VGPR), will be determined for each subject as a binary variable indicating whether the achieved a best overall response to induction therapy of VGPR or better., up to 5 year|Overall Response, The best overall response will be determined as an ordered categorial variable indicating the subject's best response at any point along the treatment continuum, up to 5 years post treatment discontinuation|MRD Negative, . Minimal residual disease (MRD) (via NGF 10-5 and 10-6) will be determined for each subject after suspected CR for Phase I subjects and at the following timepoints for Phase II subjects: after induction therapy, after ASCT, and after 12 cycles of maintenance therapy (post Cycle 18visit) and every 12 months post Cycle 18 sample., Up to 5 years|Time to First Response (TTFR), TTFR will be calculated for all subjects achieving an sCR, CR, VGPR, or PR. This will be defined as the time from initiation of belantamab mafodotin-containing protocol directed induction therapy to the time of first disease assessment indicating either sCR, CR, VGPR or PR, up to 30 days post treatment discontinuation|Time to Best Response (TTBR), Time to best response will be calculated for all subjects achieving an sCR, CR, VGPR or PR. This will be defined as the time from initiation of belantamab mafodotin-containing protocol directed induction therapy to the time of best disease assessment indicating either sCR, CR, VGPR or PR., up to 30 days post treatment discontinuation|Time to Progression (TTP), TTP is defined as the duration of time from enrollment to the study (treatment start date) to first occurrence of progressive disease, Up to 5 years|Duration of Response (DoR), DoR will be calculated for each subject achieving a PR or better and will be calculated from the time of the first assessment that identified response until disease progression or death., Up to 5 years post treatment response|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the duration from enrollment to the study (treatment start date) to the date of death from any cause., Up to 8 years|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the duration of time from enrollment to the study (treatment start date) to first occurrence of either progressive disease or death (from any cause), whichever comes first., Up to 8 years
Safety - Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), The SAE variable will be determined for each subject as a binary variability indicating whether or not subject experienced a protocol-defined SAE., Up to 4-8 weeks post treatment discontinuation|Safety - Adverse Events (AEs), The AE variable will be determined for each subject as a binary variability indicating whether or not subject experienced an AE per CTCAE V5.0., Up to 4-8 weeks post treatment discontinuation|Safety - Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs), The AESI variable will be determined for each subject as a binary variability indicating whether or not subject experienced a protocol-defined AESI., Up to 4-8 weeks post treatment discontinuation|Translational Research - PFS and OS, Describe subject outcomes of progression free survival and overall survival for MRD concordant and discordant cases, Up to 8 years|Translational Research - MRD Status, Compare MRD status concordance between NGF and QiP mass spectrometry, Up to 8 years|Translational Research - BCMA expression, Assess BCMA (B Cell Maturation Antigen) expression by plasma cells prior to therapy and at relapse using formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) bone marrow biopsies., Up to 8 years|Translational Research - Immunologic Profiles, Establish peripheral blood and bone marrow immunologic profiles throughout therapy., Up to 8 years|Translational Research - plasma BCMA expression, Correlate plasma cell BCMA (B Cell Maturation Antigen) expression with Progression Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS)., Up to 8 years|Translational Research - serum BCMA concentration, Correlate serum cell sBCMA (serum B Cell Maturation Antigen) concentration with Progression Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS)., Up to 8 years
This is a phase I dose escalation and expansion study in RMM and RRMM followed by a single arm phase II expansion in high risk, NDMM. The phase I portion of the protocol will utilize a standard 3+3 dose escalation design to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and RP2D of the KRd-belantamab mafodotin combination. The phase II portion of the trial is a two-stage design that will assess the efficacy and safety of the combination in newly diagnosed, high-risk MM patients.
