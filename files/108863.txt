Safety and Feasibility of Preoperative and Intraoperative Image-Guided Resection of Gliomas
This study evaluates the use of specialized magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques including magnetic resonance (MR) perfusion and 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) spectroscopy in the surgical treatment of gliomas.

Cohort 1 participants will undergo an MR perfusion scan or 2-HG spectroscopy prior to surgery and intra-operatively.

Cohort 2 participants will only undergo standard of care imaging and tumor acquisition. Participant participation will end at the completion of surgery and will be transitioned to standard of care follow-up.
