Laparoscopic Assisted Transanal Resection of Rectal Cancer With Total Mesorectal Excision
Rectal cancer is one of the frequent malignant neoplasms ,Total mesorectal excision (TME) has become the gold standard treatment for middle and lower rectal cancers. Laparoscopic TME still be difficult in patients with low rectal tumors, narrow pelvic anatomy, male sex or high body mass index . Difficult visualization of the pelvic anatomy along with the limitation of rigid laparoscopic instruments may affect the quality of oncological outcomes and increase the risks of injuries during surgery. A down to up approach via transanal total mesorectal excision (TaTME) technique may overcome these problems
