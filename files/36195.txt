Changing of Prostate Specific Antigen Value in Patients With Covid-19
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused a worldwide pandemic in over 100 years. The disease caused by this newly discovered virus was called Covid-19. In this study, we aimed to evaluate changing of PSA value in patients with Covid-19.
Covid19|Prostate Specific Antigen
OTHER: PSA value
PSA value, prostate specific antigen, 2 months
Ferritin, CRP, 2 months
Patients with positive PCR test results were included in the study. The age of the patient and urea, leukocyte, hemoglobin, platelet, urea, and creatinine values of the patients were recorded. Urinalysis and urine culture were taken from all patients. Acute phase reactants such as sedimentation, C-reaktif protein (CRP), ferritin, and fibrinogen were measured both at the time the patients applied and three weeks after the patient recovered. PSA and free PSA were also measured in the same way. Patients whose symptoms improved and the PCR test result was negative were considered as recovered.
