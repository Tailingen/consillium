L-Arginine Supplements in Treating Women Who Are Cancer Survivors
RATIONALE: L-arginine supplements may improve the quality of life and sexual function in women who are cancer survivors.

PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying an L-arginine supplement to see how well it works compared with a placebo in treating women who are cancer survivors.

Sexual Function, Patients filled out the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) at baseline and at 4, 8, and 12 weeks following randomization. The FSFI is comprised of 2 questions related to desire, 4 questions related to arousal, 4 questions related to lubrication, 3 questions related to orgasm, 3 questions related to satisfaction, and 3 questions related to pain. Subscale scores range from 1.2 to 6 (desire) or 0 to 6 (arousal, lubrication, orgasm, and pain) or 0.8 to 6 (satisfaction). A total FSFI score is computed as the sum of the individual subscales; the overall score ranges from 2 to 36. Higher scores indicate better sexual function. The primary outcome comparison is at 12 weeks., 12 weeks
Quality of Life, Patients filled out the FACT-G quality of life questionnaire at baseline and at 4, 8, and 12 weeks following randomization. The FACT-G questionnaire is comprised of 7 questions related to physical well-being, 7 questions related to social well-being, 6 questions related to emotional well-being, and 7 questions related to functional well-being. Subscale scores range from 0 to 24 (Emotional) or 0 to 28 (Functional, Social, and Physical). A total FACT-G score is computed as the sum of the individual subscales; the overall score ranges from 0 to 108. Higher scores indicate better quality of life. The primary comparison was at 12 weeks., 12 weeks
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine whether an L-arginine-based nutritional supplement (ArginMax®) improves the quality of life and sexual function in female cancer survivors.

Secondary

* Compare quality of life of patients treated with ArginMax® vs placebo.
* Compare toxicity of these regimens in these patients.
* Describe the sexual function symptom clusters (if any) in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to ECOG performance status (0 or 1 vs 2 or 3), type of malignancy (pelvic vs nonpelvic), and ovarian functional status (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

* Arm I: Patients receive an oral L-arginine-based nutritional supplement (ArginMax®) twice daily.
* Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily. In both arms, treatment continues for 12 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

Sexual function, quality of life, and toxicity are assessed at baseline and every 4 weeks for 12 weeks.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 186 patients will be accrued for this study.
