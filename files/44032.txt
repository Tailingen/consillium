• failure or breakage of the device. The measure of this outcome is reported with a detailed description of the event., From the beginning of the surgery until the end of surgery. Approximately 3 hours.|Evaluate the ENDONEB Usability and Safety, Safety assessment will be performed by verifying any episodes of device malfunction during the entire application such as:

• lengthening of application times due to obstruction of the catheter or obstruction of the operating channel. The outcome is measured with a score from 1 to 5 corresponding to the quality assessment: 1=not sufficient; 2=sufficient; 3=good; 4=very good; 5=excellent., From the beginning of the surgery until the end of surgery. Approximately 3 hours.
Single center, prospective, medical device usability and feasibility study. The study will be performed in Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS, Rome.

According to the recomandations of the Italian Ministry of Health (28) regarding the sample size of pilot and feasibility studies, 15 applications underwent to mucosal or submucosal resection procedures will be evaluated. The recruitment period will be 36 weeks (9 months). The evaluation ends when ENDONEB has been used in the fifteenth subject or at one third of applications if the investigators will be able to give their evaluation of the feasibility of the ENDONEB technique, usability and safety. The ENDONEB medical device belongs to the family of "Nebulizers" class IIa accessory devices, used to apply Glubran®2 in nebulized form in laparotomic, laparoscopic and thoracoscopic procedures. The ENDONEB medical device allows to apply the Glubran®2 in nebulized form in digestive endoscopy interventions and can be used both with gastroscopes and colonoscopes with an operating channel not less than 2.6 mm. It is marketed in sterile presentation; the components are latex free and is for single use only.
