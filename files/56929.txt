Impact of the Development of Pediatric Palliative Care
Despite medical advances, cancer remains the leading cause of death by disease in children.

Brain tumors are the second most common cause of cancer in children after leukemia, representing 25% of pediatric cancers.

The overall survival rate is about 50% with extremes ranging from less than 5% to more than 90% depending on the histological type of brain tumor.

The end of life of children with a brain tumor is marked by the possibility of discomfort symptoms, painful or not, and by a progressive neurological deterioration, which makes the management of these children complex for both families and health professionals.

Over the last decade, the concept of palliative care has been increasingly integrated into pediatric onco-hematology services with the primary objective of better symptom control in a global approach to the child and his or her family in order to aim at a better quality of life.
Primary Brain Tumor
Presence of symptoms of physical or psychological discomfort in the last 4 months of life, up to the last 4 months of life
The main objective of the study is to compare the occurrence and management of end-of-life symptoms in children who died of a primary brain tumor over 2 periods, in 2009 - 2010 and in 2019 - 2020, followed in the Pediatric Oncology departments of Strasbourg, Besan√ßon, Dijon, Nancy and Reims.
