A Multicenter "Ablate and Resect" Study of Novilase® Interstitial Laser Therapy for the Ablation of Small Breast Cancers
This study will determine the rate of complete tumor ablation of small breast cancers (≤ 20mm) by Novilase Interstitial Laser Therapy (ILT), and determine the sensitivity and specificity of imaging (MRI, mammography and ultrasound) in detecting residual tumor post ILT ablation as correlated to histopathology from the post-ablation excision.
Malignant Tumor
DEVICE: Novilase Interstitial Laser Therapy
Collect information on the proportion of tumors ablated for sample size calculations in the pivotal trial, Evaluate the rate of complete tumor ablation by Novilase ILT of small breast cancers and characterize the correlation of imaging (MR, US, x-ray) in detecting residual post ablation with histopathology of the excised specimen.

An individual patient will be considered to have a complete ablation if the pathology results post excision demonstrates that no visible gross residual tumor is present., one month end point
To gain experience with the cosmetic outcome and rate of recovery tools, Evaluate satisfaction, utilizing the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Breast Cancer Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-BR23) survey and cosmetic outcome utilizing the physician-reported Four-Point Scoring System of Breast Cosmesis., One month end point
