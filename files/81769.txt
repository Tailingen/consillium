A Real-world Study of Durvalumab for Lung Cancer in China
PACIFIC-PUMCH-R is an ambispective cohort study that will enroll approximately 100 patients with lung cancer who have received at least one dose of durvalumab between July 2020 and July 2021. Patient selection and data collection will be from Peking Union Medical College Hospital.

Cohort 1 will include patients with unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer (according to the Staging Manual in Thoracic Oncology, version 7, of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer) who did not have disease progression after concurrent chemoradiotherapy. The primary objective of Cohort 1 is to assess the effectiveness of durvalumab in a real-life setting by evaluating PFS and OS in Chinese patients.

Cohort 2 will enroll patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed NSCLC or SCLC who have received chemotherapy/radiotherapy at the physician's discretion. And this Cohort aimed to assess the safety of durvalumab for the treatment of lung cancer in clinical practice.

DRUG: Durvalumab|DRUG: Durvalumab
Progression-free Survival (Cohort 1), PFS is defined as time from the index date (date of the first dose of durvalumab) to the date of the first documentation of progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST 1.1 modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ, PD is defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. Note: The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD., Tumor scans performed at baseline then every ~8 weeks up to 48 weeks, then every ~12 weeks thereafter until confirmed disease progression. Assessed up to a maximum of approximately 3 years|Overall Survival (Cohort 1), OS is defined as the time from randomization to the time of death from any cause., From baseline until death due to any cause. Assessed up to a maximum of approximately 4 years.|Number of Participants With one or more Adverse Events (Cohort 2), Adverse events (AE) are graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0. Grade refers to the severity of the AE. The CTCAE v4.0 assigns Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE based on this general guideline: Grade 1 Mild AE, Grade 2 Moderate AE, Grade 3 Severe AE, Grade 4 Life-threatening or disabling AE, Grade 5 Death related to AE., Baseline until up to 90 days after end of treatment.
Objective response rate (Cohort 1), Objective response is defined as best overall response (CR or PR) across all assessment timepoints during the period from enrolment to termination of trial treatment., Tumor scans performed at baseline then every ~8 weeks up to 48 weeks, then every ~12 weeks thereafter until confirmed disease progression. Assessed up to a maximum of approximately 4 years.|Duration of Response (Cohort 1), For participants who demonstrated CR or PR, DOR is defined as the time from the first documented evidence of CR or PR until PD or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST 1.1 modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ, or death from any cause, PD is defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm., Tumor scans performed at baseline then every ~8 weeks up to 48 weeks, then every ~12 weeks thereafter until confirmed disease progression. Assessed up to a maximum of approximately 4 years.|Time to death or distant metastasis (Cohort 1), TTDM will be defined as the time from the index date (date of the first dose of durvalumab) to the first date of distant metastasis or death in the absence of distant metastasis., Tumor scans performed at baseline then every ~8 weeks up to 48 weeks, then every ~12 weeks thereafter until confirmed disease progression. Assessed up to a maximum of approximately 4 years.|Time from the index date to second progression (Cohort 1), PFS2 will be defined as the time from the index date to the earliest of the progression event subsequent to that used for the PFS endpoint or death., Following confirmed progression, patients were assessed every ~12 weeks until second disease progression. Assessed up to a maximum of approximately 4 years.|Number of Participants With one or more Adverse Events (Cohort 1), Adverse events (AE) are graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0. Grade refers to the severity of the AE., Baseline until up to 90 days after end of treatment.|Change from Baseline in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (QLQ-C30) Global Health Status/Quality of Life, The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a questionnaire to assess the overall quality of life of cancer patients. The EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire and Lung Cancer Module 13 (QLQ-LC13) is a supplemental lung cancer-specific module used in combination with QLQ-C30. An increase in combined score indicates improvement in quality of life., At baseline, every 4 weeks for first 8 weeks, then every ~8 weeks until 48 weeks, then every ~12 weeks thereafter until confirmed disease progression. Assessed up to a maximum of approximately 4 years.|Progression-free Survival (Cohort 2), PFS is defined as time from the index date (date of the first dose of durvalumab) to the date of the first documentation of progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST 1.1 modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ, PD is defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. Note: The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD., Tumor scans performed at baseline then every ~8 weeks up to 48 weeks, then every ~12 weeks thereafter until confirmed disease progression.

Assessed up to a maximum of approximately 4 years.|Objective response rate (Cohort 2), Objective response is defined as best overall response (CR or PR) across all assessment timepoints during the period from enrolment to termination of trial treatment., Tumor scans performed at baseline then every ~8 weeks up to 48 weeks, then every ~12 weeks thereafter until confirmed disease progression.
