Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (C[max]), The C(max) is the maximum plasma concentration which will be observed at the defined time points., Pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours post administration of study drug|Time to Reach the Maximum Plasma Concentration (T[max]), The T\[max\] is time to reach the observed maximum plasma concentration., Pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours post administration of study drug|Elimination Half-life (t1/2[lambda]), Elimination half-life associated with the terminal slope (lambda\[z\]) of the semi logarithmic drug concentration-time curve, calculated as 0.693/lambda (z)., Pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours post administration of study drug|Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve From Time Zero to 24 Hours, The AUC (0-24) is the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to 24 hours., Pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours post administration of study drug|Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve From Time Zero to Infinite Time (AUC [0-last]), The AUC (0-last) is the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero time of the last quantifiable concentration C(last), and C(last) is the last observed quantifiable concentration., Pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours post administration of study drug|Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve From Time Zero to Infinite Time (AUC [0-infinity]), The AUC (0-infinity) is the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinite time, calculated as the sum of AUC(0-last) and C(last)/lambda(z), wherein AUC(0-last) is area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to last quantifiable time; and C(last) is the last observed quantifiable concentration; and lambda(z) is elimination rate constant., Pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours post administration of study drug|Change in Prostate-specific Antigen (PSA), Change in prostate specific antigen will be assessed using the Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 (PCWG2) criteria and Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). PSA progression will delayed if decline from baseline: greater than or equal to (\>=) 25 percent (%) and \>= 2 nanogram per milliliter (ng/mL) above the PSA nadir, which is confirmed by a second value 3 or more weeks later; and no decline from baseline: PSA progression \>= 25% and \>= 2 ng/mL after 12 weeks., Baseline, Day 1 of each cycle (28 days) until disease progression and up to 28 days after the last dose study drug|Trough Plasma Concentration (C[trough]), Trough plasma concentration (C\[trough\]) just before dosing will be assessed., Pre- dose on Day 1 of Cycle 2 up to Cycle 13|Observed Accumulation Index (A[cc] Index), Observed Accumulation Index (A\[cc\] Index) will be calculated as AUC\[0-24\] at steady state divided by AUC\[0-24\]., Pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours post administration of study drug in Cycle 1|Effective Half-life (EHL), Effective Half-life (EHL) will be calculated as dosing interval minus log 2 divided by log {1-\[1/A\[cc\]Index}., Pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours post administration of study drug in Cycle 1|Percent Peak to Trough Fluctuation (PTF), Percent Peak to Trough Fluctuation (PTF) will be calculated as 100 multiplied by {C\[max\]/C\[min\]}., Pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours post administration of study drug in Cycle 1
This is a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label (participants will know the identity of study drug received) study in participants with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC). The study consists of 4 parts: Screening (28 days before study commences on Day 1), pharmacokinetic week (PK), Continuous daily dosing, Extension and Safety follow-up period. In PK week participants will receive a single oral capsule of JNJ-56021927 at a dose of 240 milligram (mg) on Day 1 and will be monitored for 1 week. After Week 1, in continuous daily dosing period, participants will receive continuous daily therapy at the same dose for 4 weeks (Cycle 1). After Cycle 1 participants, who will not meet the criteria for discontinuation listed such as progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity, will continue in safety follow-up period and will receive continuous daily therapy at the same dose up to cycle 13. Primarily dose limiting toxicity (DLT) will be evaluated. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout.
