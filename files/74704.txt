Paclitaxel in Patients With Metastatic or Advanced Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors (GIST) After Failure to Imatinib and Sunitinib
With discovery of KIT mutations and the advent of KIT tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib (GlivecTM, Novartis), there has been substantial improvement in overall survival in patients with advanced and/or metastatic gastrointestinal tumors (GIST). Recently, sunitinib (SuteneTM, Pfizer) showed activity as second-line therapy in GIST patients after failure with imatinib. However, virtually all patients will eventually progress or become intolerable after the first-line imatinib and the second-line sunitinib.
