RemaxolÂ® in Patients with Drug-induced Liver Injuries During Cancer Chemotherapy
Cancer has moved from the tenth place to the second one over the last 100 years, being inferior to only cardiovascular diseases in morbidity and mortality.

40 % of hepatitis cases in patients older than 40 years and 25 % of cases of fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) are caused by drug hepatic toxicity. Cases of acute drug-induced hepatitis (ADIH) make 15-20 % of patients with fulminant hepatitis in Western Europe.
