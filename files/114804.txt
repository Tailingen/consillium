Vorinostat (MK-0683, SAHA [Suberoylanilide Hydroxamic Acid]) + Lenalidomide + Dexamethasone in Multiple Myeloma (MM) (MK-0683-074)
The purpose of this Phase I study of vorinostat in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in participants with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) as estimated by the incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) as estimated by the incidence of drug-related adverse events (AEs).
Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Vorinostat|DRUG: Lenalidomide|DRUG: Dexamethasone
Number of Participants Experiencing Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), DLTs consisted of hematologic or non-hemtologic toxicities. Hematologic DLT was any grade (gr) 4 neutropenia lasting ≥7 days, gr 4 thrombocytopenia or gr 5 hematologic toxicity. Non-hematologic DLT was any gr 3, 4 or 5 non-hematologic toxicity with the exception of (1) gr 3 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or dehydration not compliant with medical care, lasting \<48 hours (2) gr 3 acidosis/alkalosis returning to ≤ gr 2 by 48 hours of medical care (3) gr 3 liver function test elevation without symptoms, lasting ≤5 days (4) Gr 3 amylase elevation without symptoms (5) Gr 3 hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hyponatremia or hyphosphatemia responding to medical care (6) Gr 3 hypercholeresterolemia or hypertriglyceridemia. A drug-related AE causing dose modification of study drug is also considered a DLT. Per protocol DLTs were analyzed in the first 28-day treatment cycle. The number of participants experiencing DLTs is reported here for all participants who got ≥1 dose of study drug., Cycle 1 (Up to 28 days)
Number of Participants Experiencing Drug-Related Adverse Events (AEs), An AE was defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, whether or not considered related to the use of the product. Any worsening of a pre-existing condition which is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product is also an AE. An AE was considered related to a drug as determined by the investigator based on exposure (evidence of exposure to drug), time course (time of AE onset versus drug-induced effect), likely cause (AE etiology related or un-related to drug), de-challenge (drug dose reduction/discontinuation) or re-challenge (drug re-exposure). Per protocol participants experiencing drug-related AEs were analyzed at the time of the protocol-specified final statistical analysis with a 3-September (Sep)-2012 data cut-off. The number of participants experiencing drug-related AEs is reported here for all participants who got ≥1 dose of study drug., Up to ~55 months (through pre-specified final statistical analysis cut-off date of 3-Sep-2012)
Number of Participants Experiencing Best Overall Response Determined by Complete Response (CR), Near Complete Response (NCR), Very Good Partial Response (VGPR), Partial Response (PR), Minimal Response (MR), Stable Disease (SD) or Progressive Disease (PD), Best overall tumor response consisted of CR (negative M-protein immunofixation \[IF\], \<5% bone marrow \[BM\] plasma cells, no soft tissue plasmacytomas \[STP\]), NCR (positive M-protein IF, \<5% BM plasma cells, no STP), VGPR (≥90% M-protein decrease, \<5% BM plasma cells, no STP), PR (≥50% M-protein, BM plasma cells, STP decrease), MR (25-49% M-protein, BM plasma cells, STP decrease), SD (\<25% decrease-25% increase in M-protein, BM plasma cells; \<25% decrease-increase in definite STP) or PD (≥25% M-protein, BM plasma cells increase; new STP, lesions). Per protocol participants experiencing best overall response by CR, NCR, VGPR, PR, MR, SD or PD were analyzed as a single prespecified analysis at the time of protocol-specified final statistical analysis with a 3-Sep-2012 data cut-off. The number of participants experiencing best overall response by CR, NCR, VGPR, PR, MR, SD or PD is reported here for all participants who got ≥1 dose of study drug and had a post baseline efficacy assessment., Up to ~55 months (through pre-specified final statistical analysis cut-off date of 3-Sep-2012)
