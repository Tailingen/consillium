Cost of Cancer Diagnosis Using Next-generation Sequencing Targeted Gene Panels in Routine Practice
The aim of this study was to measure the total cost of performing next-generation sequencing (NGS) in clinical practice in France, in both germline and somatic cancer genetics.

The study was performed on 15 French representative cancer molecular genetics laboratories performing NGS panels' tests. The production cost was estimated using a micro-costing method with resources consumed collected in situ in each laboratory from a healthcare provider perspective. A top-down methodology for specific post-sequencing steps was used.

Additional non-specific costs were also included and costs were detailed per step of the process.
