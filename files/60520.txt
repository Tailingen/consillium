A Study of Roginolisib (IOA-244) in Combination With Dostarlimab With or Without Docetaxel in Metastatic Non Small-cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Patients
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn how roginolisib works in combination with dostarlimab with or without docetaxel in adult patients with advanced non small-cell lung cancer. The main questions it aims to answer are:

To compare across the treatment arms the proportion of patients with a reduction in Treg cells To evaluate the safety and tolerability of roginolisib plus dostarlimab, with or without docetaxel
Non-Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)|Advanced Non Squamous NSCLC
DRUG: roginolisib|DRUG: Dostarlimab|DRUG: Docetaxel

Each cycle is 21 days|To compare across treatment arms the proportion of patients with a reduction in peripheral blood Tregs (for example as defined by CD4+CD25+CD127- expression), Change from baseline of at least 50% by Day 42 as assessed by mass cytometry (cytometry by time of flight, CyTOF), On Day 1 of each Cycle. Cycle length is 21 days|Number of Participants With changes in laboratory parameters, Measures by chemistry and haematology laboratory parameters, On Day 1and Day 15 of Cycle 1; Day 1 of Cycle 2 onwards.

A Phase I/IIa open-label, randomised study of oral roginolisib (IOA-244 \[roginolisib hemi-fumarate\]) in combination with dostarlimab with or without docetaxel in Advanced Non small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.

This study will enrol approximately 45 male and female patients aged over 18 years with advanced NSLCL who have process on standard of care immune checkpoint therapy and platinum doublet chemotherapy or standard immunotherapy without chemotherapy. The disease must be measurable (i.e., at least 1 measurable lesion) as per RECIST v1.1 by Computerised Tomography (CT) scan or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).
