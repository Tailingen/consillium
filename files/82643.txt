Detection of Tumor DNA in the Blood of Patients Receiving Standard Therapy for Hormone Receptor-positive (HR+) Non-HER2 Expressing (HER2-) Metastatic Breast Cancer as a Tool to Select Those Who May Benefit From the Next Course of Fulvestrant in Combination With Alpelisib or Ribociclib
After an initial screening phase (SAFIR 03 - SCREENING) to identify patients with blood circulating mutated-PIK3CA tumours persistent, patients will be enrolled in the treatment phase of SAFIR 03 (SAFIR 03 - ARRIBA) that was designed as a randomised, open-label, multicentre, phase II study, for comparison of alpelisib to ribociclib in combination with fulvestrant (as the continuation of the CDK4/6 inhibitor-fulvestrant strategy) in terms of progression-free survival (PFS).
Breast Cancer Stage IV
DRUG: Alpelisib|DRUG: Ribociclib
Progression-Free Survival in the study groups, The PFS is the length of time during and after the treatment of a disease that a patient lives with the disease but it does not get worse., From randomization to disease progression or death, up to 5 years
Overall Survival in the study groups, Overall survival (OS) is the length of time from randomization that patients enrolled in the study are still alive., From randomization to death, up to 5 years|Objective response Rate (ORR) in the study groups, Objective response rate (ORR) is the percentage of patients with a best response during treatment being either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)., 5 years|Duration of response in the study groups, Duration of response (DoR) is defined as the time interval from the date of first documented CR or PR to the date of first documented disease progression or death, from any cause., 5 years|Clinical Benefit Rate in the study groups, Clinical benefit rate (CBR) is defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall response of CR, PR, or stable disease during treatment., 5 years|Time to Response in the study groups, Time to response (TTR) is defined, for subjects with an objective response (OR), as the time from randomisation to the first documentation of OR which is subsequently confirmed., From randomization to death, up to 5 years|To validate that randomised patients with residual PIK3CA on ctDNA present a poor outcome compare to non-randomised patient, For this outcome, PFS is defined as the time interval between the date of initiation of standard of care to the date of the first documented disease progression or death, whatever the cause., From the date of initiation of standard of care to death, up to 5 years|Safety in each study groups., The National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5 (NCI-CTCAE v5) is widely accepted in the community of oncology research as the leading rating scale for adverse events. This scale, divided into 5 grades (1 = "mild", 2 = "moderate", 3 = "severe", 4 = "life-threatening", and 5 = "death") determined by the investigator, will make it possible to assess the severity of the disorders., Throughout study completion, up to 5 years|Overall Survival (OS) in non-randomised patients, For non-randomised patients, OS is the length of time from the date of initiation of standard of care that patients enrolled in the study are still alive., From the date of initiation of standard of care to death of any cause, up to 5 years|Progression Free Survival (PFS) in non-randomised patients, For non-randomised patients, PFS is the length of time during and after the treatment of a disease with the standard of care that a patient lives with the disease but it does not get worse., From randomization to death, up to 5 years
INDICATION The population eligible to the screening phase is composed of all women or men with HR+, HER2- metastatic breast cancer who are eligible for first-line treatment with a cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor combined with fulvestrant (and a luteinizing hormone realeasing hormone (LH-RH) analogue in men and premenopausal women) in the context of the standard healthcare management. The screening will identify patients with high risk of relapse on any CDK4/6 inhibitor thanks to ctDNA kinetic between baseline and 4 weeks of treatment. The purpose is to early adapt the therapeutic intervention for ctDNA no drop patient to prevent from relapse. This study will propose an intervention for PIK3CA mutated patients with alpelisib vs. ribociclib. Other therapeutic approaches might be proposed to patients with wild type PIK3CA through other protocols.

The randomised study phase will include patients with persistent mutations on exons 4, 9 or 20\* of PIK3CA ctDNA after 4 weeks of treatment with any CDK4/6 inhibitor-fulvestrant in first-line setting.
