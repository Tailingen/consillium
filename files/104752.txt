A Study on the Prevalence of Clinically Useful Mutations in Solid Tumor Characterized by Next Generation Sequencing Methods on Liquid Biopsy Analysis (POPCORN)
The implementation of liquid biopsy in clinical practice has been favored by the rapid development of genome sequencing techniques designed to analyze mutations in ctDNA. Among these, the Next generation sequencing (NGS) is a technique that consists in sequencing several genomes in a short time span, collecting information about a wider range of genomic alterations, using small quantities of genetic material. It is used to identify potential circulating dynamic biomarkers of treatment sensitivity or resistance in a real word multi-pathology evaluation. In this way, defining the mutational status of clinical relevance genes in real world, as a predictive biomarker to identify those patients most likely to benefit from target therapy, offers the potential to optimize access to further therapies. The aim of this study is to evaluate the real-world prevalence of clinically useful mutations in patients who are receiving therapy for advanced and locally advanced solid tumor through liquid biopsy.
