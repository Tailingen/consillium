Low-dose Molecular Breast Imaging: Comparison of Breast Cancer Detection Rate at Initial Screening and Two-year Follow-up
The purpose of this research is to evaluate whether repeating a screening Molecular Breast Imaging (MBI) study two years after an initial screening MBI study further improves breast cancer detection in women with dense breast tissue.
Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: Molecular Breast Imaging
Molecular Breast Imaging (MBI) scan, The Year 0 MBI will be interpreted in isolation, with the radiologist blinded to Year 0 mammogram results and all relevant clinical information., Performed at Year 0 of study
Molecular Breast Imaging (MBI) scan, The Year 2 MBI will be interpreted in comparison with the Year 0 MBI but in isolation from the Year 2 mammogram., Performed at Year 2 of study
Comparison of breast cancer detection rate for Year 0 and Year 2., The breast cancer detection rate for Year 0 and Year 2 MBI will be compared to each other and to the breast cancer detection rates for the screening mammograms performed in Year 0 and Year 2., Year 2 of study
The purpose of this research is to evaluate whether repeating a screening Molecular Breast Imaging (MBI) study two years after an initial screening MBI study further improves breast cancer detection in women with dense breast tissue.
