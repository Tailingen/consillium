Sensitivity of Multiparametric MRI in Differentiation Between Muscle Invasive and Non-muscle Invasive Urinary Bladder Cancer
Differentiation between non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) and muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is a cornerstone in the treatment plans.Therefore, this study will try to evaluate the sensitivity and reliability of mpMRI in accurate diagnosis of cancer bladder.

Primary objective: to detect the sensitivity of multiparametric MRI in differentiation between muscle Invasive and non-muscle invasive Urinary Bladder Cancer in relation to the conventional cystoscopy and histopathological examination of the biopsy.
