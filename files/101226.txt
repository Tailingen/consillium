Phase 1 Study of Anti-PD-L1 Monoclonal Antibody KN035 to Treat Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is an open label, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of KN035 in advanced and metastatic solid tumor.
Solid Tumors
DRUG: KN035
Incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), From screening to up to cycle 1 (28 days)|Percentage of participants with adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events and AEs of special interest, From screening to up to 3 months after the last dose of study drug (up to approximately 2 years)
Serum Concentrations of KN035, Blood samples will be collected at Pre-dose, 6hrs,24 hrs,48hrs,96hrs after the end of the first injection of KN035, after injection of KN035 at Day 8, 15, 22 in first cycle and pre-dose and within 24hrs of following cycles(Cycle length = 28 days), and at the mandatory Safety Follow-up visits, From Pre-dose of the first dose to up to 3 months after the last dose of study drug (up to approximately 2 years)|Percentage of Participants with Best Overall Response as determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) Version (v) 1.1, Baseline until disease progression, death, loss to follow-up, initiation of another anti-cancer treatment, withdrawal of consent, or study termination by the Sponsor, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 2 years)|Percentage of Participants with Objective Response as determined by RECIST v1.1, Baseline until disease progression, death, loss to follow-up, initiation of another anti-cancer treatment, withdrawal of consent, or study termination by the Sponsor, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 2 years)|Duration of Objective Response as determined by RECIST v1.1, Baseline until disease progression, death, loss to follow-up, initiation of another anti-cancer treatment, withdrawal of consent, or study termination by the Sponsor, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 2 years)|Progression Free Survival Duration as determined by RECIST v1.1, Baseline until disease progression, death, loss to follow-up, initiation of another anti-cancer treatment, withdrawal of consent, or study termination by the Sponsor, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 2 years)|Overall Survival Duration, Baseline until disease progression, death, loss to follow-up, initiation of another anti-cancer treatment, withdrawal of consent, or study termination by the Sponsor, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 2 years)|Percentage of participants with anti-therapeutic antibody (ATA), Blood samples will be collected at Pre-dose of Cycle 1 and D1,8 of the following cycles., From screening to up to 3 months after the last dose of study drug (up to approximately 2 years)
The dose escalation will follow the traditional 3+3 design. Cohorts of 3-6 subjects will be enrolled sequentially at escalating doses of 1, 2.5, 5 and 10 mg/kg weekly. Dosing schedule for cohorts 2 and above may change after interim PK analysis after Cohort 1 Cycle 1 to bi-weekly or other regimen based on elimination profile of KN035 to avoid excessive drug accumulation. Dose escalation will continue until identification of MTD, up to a maximum dose of 10 mg/kg. MTD is defined as the highest dose studied at which no more than 1 of 6 subjects has experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in Cycle 1.
