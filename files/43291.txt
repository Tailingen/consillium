PET Study With [89Zr]-Df-CriPec® Docetaxel
A clinical phase I, open-label PET study with \[89Zr\]-Df-CriPec® docetaxel in patients with solid tumours to assess biodistribution and tumour accumulation of \[89Zr\]-Df-CriPec® docetaxel.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: Cripec Docetaxel
Detection (visual) of [89Zr]-Df-CriPec® docetaxel in tumour lesions (the short axis diameter of a visually assessable and quantifiable lesion must be ≥ 2 cm), Visual detection (absent/present) of tumor uptake, 14 days|Detection (quantitative) of [89Zr]-Df-CriPec® docetaxel in tumour lesions (the short axis diameter of a visually assessable and quantifiable lesion must be ≥ 2 cm), Measured by SUVpeak values of visual positive lesions, 14 days
Dosimetry of [89Zr]-Df-CriPec® docetaxel, Based on 89Zr PK activity concentration (Bq/ml) and biodistribution \[89Zr\]-Df-CriPec® docetaxel scans, 14 days|Optimal time point for PET imaging after [89Zr]-Df-CriPec® docetaxel administration, As assesed by a multidisciplinairy team, 14 days|Linearity between [89Zr]-Df-CriPec® docetaxel and total docetaxel, Assessment of 89Zr PK (Bq/ml) and total docetaxel (ng/ml), 14 days|Biodistribution of low dose dose [89Zr]-Df-CriPec® docetaxel before and after administration of therapeutic dose of CriPec® docetaxel (quantified with %ID [89Zr] CriPec® docetaxel), Measured by defining volumes of interest (VOI) of various organs on PET scan and calculating %ID/kg, 14 days
After patient inclusion an fludeoxyglucose-18 (\[18F\]-FDG) PET scan will be performed to delineate viable tumour lesions. On day 1, patients will receive a low dose of \[89Zr\]-Df-CriPec® docetaxel (corresponding to approximately 0.1-1 mg docetaxel) followed by maximally 3 \[89Zr\] PET scans (timing of PET scan can be adapted depending on results obtained, within timeframe of 2 h - 9 days after administration) to evaluate biodistribution and tumour uptake. Two weeks later, the patients will receive unlabelled CriPec® docetaxel up to the Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) given every 3 weeks (Q3W) that will be determined in the phase I NAPOLY trial (CT-CL01), immediately followed by a second low dose of \[89Zr\]-Df-CriPec® docetaxel and maximally 3 \[89Zr\]PET scans (timing of PET scan can be adapted depending on results obtained, within timeframe of 2 hrs - 9 days after administration) to evaluate biodistribution and tumour uptake with therapeutic dosage.
