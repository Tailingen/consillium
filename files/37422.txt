CD30 Imaging in Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma
The antibody drug conjugate (ADC) brentuximab vedotin (BV), targeting CD30, is currently registered for the treatment of previously untreated stage III-IV Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma, relapsed systemic anaplastic large T-cell lymphoma (sALCL) and relapsed CD30 expressing cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, type mycosis fungoides (CTCL, MF) with overall response rates (ORR) up to 70%. BV has shown promising results in other CD30 expressing non-hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), including relapsed angio-immunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), peripheral T-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS), post-transplant lymphoproliferative diseases (PTLD) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with ORR rates of 50%, 40% and 45%, respectively. Despite expression of CD30 on tumor cells, no objective responses were observed in relapsed primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL). Strikingly, thus far correlative studies have not found predictive markers in tissue or blood that are predictive for response to treatment. Since CD30 expression in tumor tissue is unrelated to treatment outcome, this suggests involvement of phenomena like tumor heterogeneity, drug uptake in the tumor micro-environment or very low CD30 expression below the immunohistochemistry (IHC) threshold. In this imaging study the biodistribution of brentuximab will be investigated by using Zirconium-89 (89Zr)-labeled brentuximab. 89Zr-brentuximab imaging will help to assess tumor uptake and pharmacokinetic (PK) and -dynamic properties of brentuximab in patients who are intended to be treated with BV, either in one of the registered indications (HL, CTCL and sALCL) or as part of the HOVON 136 trial for patients with DLBCL. The hypothesize is that the results of this imaging study might be used to facilitate the identification of patients that would benefit most from BV treatment
