Perioperative Durvalumab With Neoadjuvant ddMVAC or Gemcitabine/Cisplatin in Patients With Muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer (NIAGARA-2)
The Phase IIIb NIAGARA-2 study aims to expand on the data from the Phase III NIAGARA study by investigating perioperative durvalumab in combination with investigator-selected cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (either ddMVAC or gemcitabine/cisplatin) in a clinical practice setting.
