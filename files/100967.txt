Contribution of Hypnosis to Anxiety and Pain in Brachytherapy Patients
Formal hypnosis is a non-drug technique known to decrease anxiety and pain during the preoperative procedure.

In brachytherapy, the practice of hypnosis has been shown to be feasible and beneficial for patients treated for prostate cancer The goal of the study is to demonstrate the added value of hypnosis during a brachytherapy detachment by improving the comfort of the patient.

The investigators want to evaluate the contribution of hypnosis during brachytherapy detachment by quantifying the anxiety and pain felt by the patient during the procedure.

Patient inform their level of pain from 0 to 10 (11 point scale) with the understanding that 0 is equal to no pain and 10 is equal to worst possible pain, 1 day|Anxiety evaluation, Anxiety will be evaluated by a numeric scale just before and just after the brachytherapy detachment. Patient inform their level of anxiety from 0 to 10 (11 point scale) with the understanding that 0 is equal to no anxiety and 10 is equal to worst possible anxiety, 1 day|Patient's perception of the care, The patient's perception of the care will be evaluated by a semi-directive phone interview conducted by the medical staff between day 3 and day 5 after the brachytherapy detachment, 1day|Time of brachytherapy detachment, The time of brachytherapy detachment will be noted from the entrance to the patient's examination room until the end of the brachytherapy detachment, 1day|Realization of the brachytherapy detachment, The ease of realization of the brachytherapy detachment and the comfort of the medical staff will be evaluated by an numeric scale at the end of the care and by a self-survey, 1day
