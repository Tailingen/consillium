T Cell Receptor Immunotherapy Targeting MAGE-A3 for Patients With Metastatic Cancer Who Are HLA-DP0401 Positive
Background:

The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Surgery Branch has developed an experimental therapy for treating patients with metastatic cancer that involves taking white blood cells from the patient, growing them in the laboratory in large numbers, genetically modifying these specific cells with a type of virus (retrovirus) to attack only the tumor cells, and then giving the cells back to the patient. This type of therapy is called gene transfer. In this protocol, we are modifying the patient s white blood cells with a retrovirus that has the gene for anti-Melanoma antigen family A, 3 (MAGE-A3)-DP0401/0402 incorporated in the retrovirus.

Objective:

The purpose of this study is to determine a safe number of these cells to infuse and to see if these particular tumor-fighting cells (anti-MAGE-A3-DP0401/0402 cells) cause tumors to shrink and to be certain the treatment is safe.

Eligibility:

- Adult's age 18-70 with metastatic cancer expressing the MAGE-A3 molecule.

Design:

* Work up stage: Patients will be seen as an outpatient at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) clinical Center and undergo a history and physical examination, scans, x-rays, lab tests, and other tests as needed
* Leukapheresis: If the patients meet all of the requirements for the study, they will undergo leukapheresis to obtain white blood cells to make the anti-MAGE-A3-DP0401/0402 cells. {Leukapheresis is a common procedure, which removes only the white blood cells from the patient.}
* Treatment: Once their cells have grown, the patients will be admitted to the hospital for the conditioning chemotherapy, the anti-MAGE-A3-DP0401/0402 cells and aldesleukin. They will stay in the hospital for approximately 4 weeks for the treatment.
* Follow up: Patients will return to the clinic for a physical exam, review of side effects, lab tests, and scans about every 1-3 months for the first year, and then every 6 months to 1 year as long as their tumors are shrinking.

Complete response is disappearance of all target lesions. Partial response is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions. Progression is at least a 20% increase in the sum of longest diameter of target lesions or the appearance of one or more new lesions.

A non-serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence. A serious adverse event is an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that results in death, a life-threatening adverse drug experience, hospitalization, disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, congenital anomaly/birth defect or important medical events that jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the previous outcomes mentioned., Date treatment consent signed to date off study, an average of 17 months|Number of Participants With Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLT), A dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is all grade 3 and greater toxicities with the exception of myelosuppression, aldesleukin expected toxicities, expected chemotherapy toxicities, immediate hypersensitivity reactions occurring within 2 hours of cell infusion, grade 3 fever, grade 3 metabolic laboratory abnormalities without significant clinical sequela that resolve within grade 2 within 7 days, and grade 3 autoimmunity that resolves to less than or equal to a grade 2 autoimmune toxicity within 10 days., Before progression to next-higher dose level, approximately 2 weeks
Background:

* We have constructed a single retroviral vector that contains both and $ \<= chains of a T cell receptor (TCR) that recognizes the DP0401/0402 restricted Melanoma antigen family A, 3 (MAGE-A3) tumor antigen, which can be used to mediate genetic transfer of this TCR with high efficiency.
* In co-cultures with HLA-DP0401/0402 and MAGE-A3 double positive tumors, the anti- MAGE-A3- DP0401/0402 restricted (anti-MAGE-A3-DP4) TCR transduced T cells secreted significant amounts of Interferon gamma (IFN-y) with high specificity.

Objectives:

Primary objectives:

* Determine a safe dose of the administration of autologous cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) cells transduced with an anti-MAGE-A3-DP0401/0402 restricted (MAGE-A3-DP4) TCR and aldesleukin to patients following a nonmyeloablative but lymphoid depleting preparative regimen.
* Determine if this approach will result in objective tumor regression in patients with metastatic cancer expressing MAGE-A3-DP4.
* Determine the toxicity profile of this treatment regimen.

Eligibility:

Patients who are human leukocyte antigens (HLA)-DP0401/0402 positive and 18 years of age or older must have

* Metastatic cancer whose tumors express the MAGE-A3-DP4 antigen.
* Previously received and have been a non-responder to or recurred following at least one first line treatment for metastatic disease.

Patients may not have:

- Contraindications for high dose aldesleukin administration.

Design:

* PBMC obtained by leukapheresis will be enriched for CD4 cells and transduced with the retroviral vector supernatant encoding the anti-MAGE-A3-DP4 TCR.
* The study will begin in a standard phase 1 dose escalation. After the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) cell dose has been determined, patients will be enrolled into the phase 2 portion of the trial at the MTD established during the phase 1 portion of the study. In the phase 2 portion, patients will be entered into two cohorts: cohort 1 will include patients with metastatic melanoma; cohort 2 will include patients with renal cancer and other types of metastatic cancer.
* Patients will receive a nonmyeloablative but lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine followed by intravenous infusion of ex vivo tumor reactive, TCR gene-transduced peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) plus intravenous (IV) aldesleukin.
* Patients will undergo complete evaluation of tumor response every 1-6 months until off study criteria are met.
* For each of the 2 strata evaluated in the phase 2 portion, the study will be conducted using a phase 2 optimal design where initially 21 evaluable patients will be enrolled. For each of these two arms of the trial, if 0 or 1 of the 21 patients experiences a clinical response, then no further patients will be enrolled but if 2 or more of the first 21 evaluable patients enrolled have a clinical response, then accrual will continue until a total of 41 evaluable patients have been enrolled in that stratum.
* For both strata, the objective will be to determine if the treatment regimen is able to be associated with a clinical response rate that can rule out 5% (p0=0.05) in favor of a modest 20% partial response (PR) + complete response (CR) rate (p1=0.20).
