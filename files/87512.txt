Camrelizumab Plus Chemoradiotherapy for Patients With Locoregional Cancer of Nasal Cavity and Paranasal Sinuses
Patients with locoregional cancer of nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses are candidate for this study. All the eligible patients receive three cycles of induction chemotherapy (docetaxel 60mg/m2+cisplatin 60mg/m2+5-FU2.5g/m2,civ48h, q3w) followed by concurrent two cycles of cisplatin (80mg/m2,q3w) with curative intensity modulated radiotherapy. Besides, camrelizumab (200mg) is administrated every three weeks for a total of 11 cycles since the first day of induction chemotherapy. We aim to evaluate the three years failure free survival of these patients by the combination of camrelizumab with curative radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
