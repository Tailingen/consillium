Cryoablation Combined with Sintilimab Plus Lenvatinib in Previously Treated Unresectable Liver Metastasis from Solid Tumors
The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cryoablation combined with Sintilimab plus lenvatinib for patients with unresectable liver metastasis, who had progressed after, or were refractory to first- or later-line therapy.

Recent studies have suggested that local destruction of tumor tissue by cryoablation induced activation and maturation of dendritic cells and tumor-specific T cells by cross-presentation of tumor antigens. While pd-1 blocking antibody interferes with PD-1 mediated T-cell regulatory signaling. And combination of pd-1 blocking antibody plus lenvatinib showed increased ORR in many type of solid tumors. Therefore, the objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cryoablation combined with Sintilimab plus lenvatinib in previously treated unresectable liver metastasis from solid tumors.
