A Study to Evaluate Clinical Characteristics of Lung Cancer in Patients With Surgeries and Adjuvant Therapies
The study was designed to evaluate effectiveness of the surgeries and adjuvant therapies after surgeries in the patients with lung malignant tumors
Lung Cancer
PROCEDURE: Surgeries
Demographic characteristics of the patients with lung malignant tumors who received surgeries, Demographic characteristics of the patients with lung malignant tumors who received surgeries of thoracotomy, video-assistant thoracic surgery or robotic thoracic surgery as measured by:

* Age
* Gender
* Payment types
* Insurance types
* Smoking history
* Complications and symptoms of complications
* Respiratory functions
* Type of diagnoses, 2014 - 2017

* Age
* Gender
* Payment types
* Insurance types
* Smoking history
* Complications and symptoms of complications
* Respiratory functions
* Type of diagnoses, 2014 - 2017|Tumor clinical/pathological types, Tumor clinical/pathological types, 2014 - 2017|Type of EGFR, Type of EGFR, 2014 - 2017|ECOG scores, ECOG scores, 2014 - 2017|1-year and 3-year overall survivals, 1-year and 3-year overall survivals, 2014 - 2017
The trial is a multi-centre real-world non-interventional observational study to evaluate effectiveness of the surgeries and adjuvant therapies after surgeries in the patients with lung malignant tumors via a retrospectively review method on the study data on patient demographic/tumor biological characteristics and clinical treatments.
