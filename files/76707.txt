Microwave Treatment for Actinic Keratosis
This is a randomized, controlled, multi-center trial in subjects diagnosed with Actinic Keratosis (AK) where each subject serves as their own control. The trial will be conducted at 2 sites, one in Germany and one in the United States. Approximately 60 subjects will be randomized to ensure 51 subjects complete the study.
Keratosis, Actinic
DEVICE: Swift System
Proportion of subjects with treatment success of Actinic Keratosis at 2 months following Swift Microwave treatment., Definition:

Treatment Success: complete clearance of â‰¥75% Actinic Keratosis lesions treated per subject, i.e., at least 75% of the AK lesions treated are fully cleared (not partially cleared)., 2 months post first treatment
Proportion of subjects with treatment success of Actinic Keratosis following Swift Microwave treatment., 4 and 6 months post first treatment|Proportion of subjects with 100% clearance of Actinic Keratosis following Swift Microwave treatment, 2, 4 and 6 months post first treatment|Percentage of Actinic Keratosis lesions cleared across all study lesions following Swift Microwave treatment, 2, 4 and 6 months post first treatment|OCT Analysis as assessed by an AK Classification System, AK Lesions classified as Not Present, AK I (Grade I mild), AK II (Grade II, moderate) or AK III (Grade III severe), Baseline and 2, 4 and 6 months post first treatment|Proportion of subjects with reoccurrence of any Actinic Keratosis lesions at 6 months, as classified by the blinded site investigator. The subject's AK lesion must be classified as completely resolved at 2 months to be considered a reoccurrence., 6 months post first treatment|Level of pain during treatment using a severity scale, The subject is asked to rate the worst pain experienced during treatment as None, Mild, Moderate or Severe, Treatment 1 (Day 0), Treatment 2 (Day 28)|Level of pain after treatment using a severity scale, The subject is asked to rate the worst pain experienced during the 10 minute period after treatment is completed as None, Mild, Moderate or Severe, Treatment 1 (Day 0), Treatment 2 (Day 28)|Duration of pain after treatment using a time period scale, For subjects who experienced pain after treatment, the subject is asked to rate the duration of pain experienced during the 10 minute period after treatment using the following time period scales: a few seconds, up to 1 minute, up to 2 minutes, up to 3 minutes, Still Sore., Treatment 1 (Day 0), Treatment 2 (Day 28)|Difference in cosmetic outcomes between treated and non-treated Actinic Keratosis as classified by the independent blinded assessors using a grading system, Photographs of each treated and non-treated AK lesion will be assessed by the independent blinded assessors for cosmetic outcome as "excellent" (slight redness or pigmentation change), "good" (moderate redness or pigmentation change), "fair" (slight-to-moderate scarring, atrophy or induration), or "poor" (extensive scarring, atrophy or induration). Each assessment compares the photos taken at the current visit against the photos taken at the previous visit. The assessments by each independent blinded assessor is recorded separately., 2, 4 and 6 months post first treatment|Severity and occurrence of Adverse Events, Up to 12 months post first treatment|Evaluation of Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) at baseline and 6 months post first treatment using a rating scale, At Baseline, the subject will be asked to rate how their AK lesions affect their daily activities, lifestyle and mood as: none, mild, moderate and severe.

At 6-months post first treatment, the subject will be asked to rate how their daily activities, lifestyle and mood are now affected, when compared to before study treatment as: significantly better, better, unchanged, worse, significantly worse.

The results at baseline and at 6 months post first treatment will be evaluated., Baseline and 6 months post first treatment|Evaluation of Quality of Life (QoL) questionnaires at baseline and 6 months post first treatment using the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) questionnaire, The DLQI questionnaire measures how the AK lesions have affected the subject's life over the past week. The score at baseline and at 6 months post first treatment will be evaluated., Baseline and 6 months post first treatment|Evaluation of Cosmetic Outcome at 6 months post first treatment using a rating scale, The subject will be asked to rate the AK lesions that were treated compared to before treatment as: significantly better, better, unchanged, worse, significantly worse., 6 months post first treatment|Long term follow-up of subjects with reoccurrence at 12 months as classified by the blinded site investigator, 12 months post first treatment
The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy of the Swift Microwave Treatment on resolution of Actinic Keratosis lesions.

The secondary objectives of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of Swift Microwave treatment as a therapy for Actinic Keratosis (AK).

Eligible subjects who provide written informed consent and have 10, 12 or 14 distinct Actinic Keratosis lesions located on their scalp or hands will be randomized onto the study. Randomization of AK lesions will be stratified by side. Subjects will be randomized to treatment on half the number of AK lesions mapped located on their scalp or hands. The mapped AK lesions not randomized for treatment will receive no treatment (control).

The microwave energy applied by the Swift device will be applied to the randomized AK lesion sites for up to 2 treatments, spaced out by a 4-week interval. Follow-up is 2-months after the first treatment is administered where the AK lesions are assessed for resolution. Further follow-up visits occur at 4-months, 6-months and 12-months after the first treatment was administered where the AK lesions will be assessed for resolution or reoccurence.
