Tamibarotene Plus Venetoclax/Azacitidine in Participants With Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
Tamibarotene is being studied as a treatment for participants with a type of leukemia called acute myeloid leukemia, or AML for short. Tamibarotene is being studied as a treatment for participants with AML whose cancer has a specific genetic abnormality characterized by the overexpression of the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA) gene. This genetic profile is found in about 3 of every 10 people with AML.

During the trial, tamibarotene will be given with 2 other drugs that are already used together to treat people who have AML and who cannot start treatment with standard chemotherapy.

DRUG: Tamibarotene|DRUG: Venetoclax|DRUG: Azacitidine
Part 1: Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that developed or worsened in severity during the conduct of a clinical study and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug. A TEAE was any untoward medical occurrence associated with use of a study drug/study participation, whether or not considered related to study drug after first dose. TEAEs were defined as those adverse events AEs with onset after the first dose of study treatment or existing events that worsened after the first dose during the study up until the last dose of study treatment plus 30 days.

This study consists of 3 parts. In Part 1, the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation of tamibarotene/venetoclax/azacitidine combination will inform the appropriate tamibarotene dose to be combined with the standard of care (SOC) venetoclax/azacitidine in Part 2 and Part 3. In Part 2, participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive either tamibarotene/venetoclax/azacitidine or venetoclax/azacitidine to compare the clinical activity of the 2 combinations. In Part 3, tamibarotene will be added to the venetoclax/azacytidine regimen of a subset of Part 2 participants who experience progressive disease, relapse after initial complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) response, or treatment failure.
