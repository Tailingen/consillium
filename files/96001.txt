A Phase Ib/II Study of BEZ235 and Trastuzumab in Patients With HER2-positive Breast Cancer Who Failed Prior to Trastuzumab
This is a prospective, multi-center, open-label, phase Ib/ II study (two parts) with patients that have locally advanced or metastatic HER2+ breast cancer. The first part (phase Ib) will investigate the MTD/ RP2D of the combination therapy of BEZ235 BID and weekly trastuzumab using a Bayesian model. Once MTD/ RP2D is established the second part (phase II) will start. Phase II will evaluate the efficacy and the safety of weekly trastuzumab plus BEZ235 BID compared to capecitabine and lapatinib.

DRUG: BEZ235 + Trastuzumab Phase l/Phase ll)|DRUG: Lapatinib + Capecitabine (Phase II)
Incidence of Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT) in the first cycle - phase lb, DLT is defined as treatment-related toxicity (classified according Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4) occurring during the first 28 treatment days and meeting specific protocol-predefined criteria.

The information will be integrated in a Bayesian logistic regression model with overdose control to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), First treatment cycle (28 days)|Progression Free Survival (PFS) based on local radiological assessment - phase ll, PFS is defined as the time from randomization until objective tumor progression or death from any cause. Radiological assessments will be performed every 6 weeks for the first 36 weeks after treatment start, then every 12 weeks., Randomization, disease progression or start of of new anti-neoplastic therapy (expected average: 12 months)
Progression Free Survival (PFS) - Phase lb, Time from treatment start until objective tumor progression or death from any cause. Radiological assessments will be performed every 8 weeks for the first 32 weeks after treatment start, then every 12 weeks., Randomization, Randomization, disease progression or start of of new anti-neoplastic therapy (expected average: 12 months)|Overall Response Rate (ORR)- Phase lb, Proportion of patients with a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST 1.1, 12 months|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) (Phase lb), Proportion of patients with a best overall response of CR, PR or stable disease (SD) with a duration of 24 weeks or longer according to RECIST 1.1, 12 months|Frequency and severity of Adverse Events - Phase lb, Incidence of adverse events (based on common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) Version 4) summarized by system organ class and/or preferred term, severity and relation to study treatment., until 30 days after treatment discontinuation|BEZ235 plasma and trastuzumab serum concentrations - phase lb, BEZ235 plasma and trastuzumab serum concentrations obtained during the two sampling windows (pre-dose and post-dose). No pharmacokinetic parameters will be calculated and no formal statistical analysis will be performed., Pre-dose (cycle 1 through 9) and 4-6 hours post-dose (cycle 1 and 2)|Overall Response Rate (ORR) - phase ll, Proportion of patients with a best overall response of CR or PR according to RECIST 1.1, 12 months|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) - phase ll, Proportion of patients with a best overall response of CR, PR or SD with a duration of 24 weeks or longer according to RECIST 1.1, 12 months|Time to overall response (TTR) - phase ll, Time from randomization until first documented response., 12 months|Duration of overall response (DR) - phase ll, Time between the first documented response and first documented progression or death due to underlying cancer., 12 months|Median overall survival (OS) (phase ll), Time from randomization to the date of death due to any cause., Randomization, death (expected average:24 months)|PFS based on central radiological assessment (phase ll), Time from randomization until objective tumor progression or death from any cause. Radiological assessments will be performed every 6 weeks for the first 36 weeks after treatment start, then every 12 weeks, centrally collected and read., Randomization, disease progression or start of of new anti-neoplastic therapy (expected average: 12 months)|Frequency and severity of adverse events (phase ll), Incidence of adverse events (based on CTCAE Version 4) summarized by system organ class and/or preferred term, severity and relation to study treatment., Until 30 days after treatment discontinuation|Efficacy in subgroups of patients with activated/non-activated PI3K pathway (phase ll), Efficacy (e.g. PFS, ORR, CBR) according to PI3K activation and treatment group., 12 months
