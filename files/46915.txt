Safety Study of Adenovirus Vector Engineered to Express hIL-12 in Combination With Activator Ligand to Treat Melanoma
This research study involves two investigational drugs, an Activator Ligand (INXN-1001) in combination with an Adenovirus Vector Engineered to Express hIL-12 (INXN-2001). IL-12 is a protein that may improve the body's natural response to disease by enhancing the ability of the immune system to kill tumor cells and may interfere with blood flow to the tumor.

The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of tumor injections of INXN-2001 given in combination with different doses of INXN-1001.
Melanoma
BIOLOGICAL: INXN-2001|DRUG: INXN-1001
Evaluate the safety and tolerability of intratumoral injections of INXN-2001 (Ad-RTS-hIL-12) at a constant dose in combination with inter-cohort escalating doses of INXN-1001 (activator ligand) in subjects with unresectable Stage III or IV melanoma., Evaluation will be based on the incidence, intensity, and type of Adverse Events (AEs). Clinically significant changes in the subjects' physical examinations, vital signs, and ECG evaluations, and clinical manifestations relevant to abnormal laboratory values will be captured as AEs., June 2014

Single-arm, open label, Phase I/II dose escalation study of intratumoral injections INXN-2001 and oral INXN-1001 in subjects with unresectable Stage III or IV melanoma.

Four sequential dose escalation cohorts of INXN-1001 in combination with a fixed dose of INXN-2001 are planned. Subject enrollment and dose escalation will proceed according to a standard 3+3 design.

Approximately 15 additional subjects will be enrolled as an expansion cohort at a single dose level at or below the MTD.

* Safety and tolerability will be assessed by the incidence and severity of adverse events.
* The antitumor activity of study treatment will be assessed according to RECIST v1.1 guidelines. Additional assessment of anti-tumor activity will be explored based on total measurable tumor burden.
* Immunological and biological markers of response will include examinations of tumor biopsy samples, cytokine levels, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and antibody response to INXN-2001.
