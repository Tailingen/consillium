Elimination of PTV Margins Based on Online Adaptive Stereotactic Radiotherapy for Early-stage Non-small Cell Lung Cancer or Pulmonary Oligometastases
This study aims to explore the safety and efficacy of eliminating the PTV (planning target volume) margins based on online adaptive stereotactic radiotherapy for patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or pulmonary oligometastases.

Objective response rate, Objective Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of patients whose tumor size decreases to a pre-specified value and is maintained for a certain period of time during cancer treatment. It includes the number of patients with Complete Response (CR) and Partial Response (PR) as a percentage of the total number of evaluable cases., 2 months after radiotherapy|Local control rate, The control of the local lesion after treatment., 2 year
This study aims to explore the safety and efficacy of eliminating the PTV expansion margin based on online adaptive stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or pulmonary oligometastases. In this study, patients will be stratified according to whether they have primary early-stage NSCLC, then randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the study group or the control group. Patients in the study group will receive online adaptive SBRT (without PTV expansion margin), while patients in the control group will receive conventional standard SBRT. After the completion of treatment, patients will be followed up regularly to assess safety and efficacy.
