Pamiparib in mCRPC With HRD or BRCA1/2 Mutation
The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of a PARP inhibitor, Pamiparib, in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients with homologous recombination deficiency or BRCA 1 or 2 somatic/germline mutation.
Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Pamiparib
Radiologic Progression-free Survival (rPFS), Radiologic progression-free survival will be assessed from the time of the first dose to radiologic disease progression or death from any cause, whichever comes first., 3 years
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Proportion of patients in complete remission (CR) plus partial remission (PR), From enrollment to primary completion of study (up to approximately 3 years)|Duration of Response (DOR), Time from the start of the first assessment of the tumor as CR or PR to the first assessment of PD (Progressive Disease) or death from any cause., From enrollment to primary completion of study (up to approximately 3 years)|Time to Response (TTR), Time from initiation of treatment to first assessment of tumor as CR or PR., From enrollment to primary completion of study (up to approximately 3 years)|Clinical Benefit Rate, according to RECIST, is either complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) lasting for at least 16 weeks, 3 years|Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Response Rate, Proportion of patients with a 50% decrease in PSA from baseline, From enrollment to primary completion of study (up to approximately 3 years)|Time to PSA Progression, Time from initiation of treatment to two consecutive 50% PSA increases from baseline level, From enrollment to primary completion of study (up to approximately 3 years)|Overall Survival (OS), Time between the start of treatment and death from any cause, From enrollment to primary completion of study (up to approximately 3 years)|Adverse events, Adverse events are graded according to the CTCAE V4.03, 3 years
rPFS stratified by baseline HRD score (HRD score threshold is defined as 9), The rPFS is defined as the duration from Pamiparib initiation to radiologic disease progression or death from any cause, whichever comes first., 3 years|OS stratified by baseline HRD score (HRD score threshold is defined as 9), The OS is defined as the duration from Pamiparib initiation to any death., 3 years
This is a single arm, open-label, single center, phase II trial, assessing the efficacy of a PARP inhibitor, Pamiparib, in 50 progressing metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients with at least one line of androgen deprivation therapy or chemotherapy at the metastatic setting, and homologous recombination deficiency or BRCA 1 or 2 somatic or germline mutation.
