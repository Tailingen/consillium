Study Assessing Activity of Intravenous (IV) Etentamig Monotherapy Versus Standard Available Therapies in Adult Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a cancer of the blood's plasma cells. The cancer is typically found in the bones and bone marrow (the spongy tissue inside of the bones) and can cause bone pain, fractures, infections, weaker bones, and kidney failure. Treatments are available, but MM can come back (relapsed) or may not get better (refractory) with treatment. This is a study to determine change in disease symptoms of etentamig compared to standard available therapies in adult participants with relapsed/refractory (R/R) MM.

Etentamig is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment of R/R MM. This study is broken into 2 Arms; Arm A and Arm B. In Arm A, participants will receive etentamig as a monotherapy. In Arm B, participants will receive the standard available therapy (SAT) identified by the Investigator during screening, in accordance with the local (or applicable) approved label, package insert, summary of product characteristics, and/or the institutional guidelines, as applicable. Around 380 adult participants with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma will be enrolled at approximately 140 sites across the world.

In Arm A participants will receive etentamig as an infusion into the vein in 28 day cycles, during the 3.5 year study duration. In Arm B, participants will receive the SAT identified by the Investigator during screening, in accordance with the local (or applicable) approved label, package insert, summary of product characteristics, and/or the institutional guidelines, as applicable, during the 3.5 year study duration.

There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood tests, checking for side effects and questionnaires.

Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the duration from the date of randomization to the date of confirmed disease progression (PD) determined by independent review committee (IRC) per international myeloma working group (IMWG) (2016) response criteria, or death, whichever occurs first., Up to Approximately 5 Years|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve confirmed partial response (PR) + VGPR + complete response (CR) + stringent complete response (sCR) or per IRC assessment., Up to Approximately 5 Years
Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the duration from the date of randomization to the date of the participant's death., Up to Approximately 5 Years|Change in Rate of Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) or Better (>= VGPR), The rate of \>= VGPR is defined as the proportion of participants who achieve a VGPR or better determined by IMWG (2016) response criteria, per IRC assessment, prior to the initiation of new myeloma therapy., Up to Approximately 5 Years|Change in Rate of CR or Better (>=CR), \>=CR is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve confirmed CR + sCR or per IRC assessment., Up to Approximately 5 Years|Change in Rate of Minimum Residual Disease (MRD) negativity with >= CR, MRD negativity with \>= CR, defined as achievement of CR or better by IMWG (2016) response criteria (per IRC assessment) and MRD negative status as assessed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) Adaptive Clonoseq at 10\^-5 threshold., Up to Approximately 5 Years|Change from Baseline in Disease Symptoms as Measured by the Disease Symptoms Domain of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire - Multiple Myeloma Module (EORTC QLQ-MY20), The disease symptoms domain of EORTC QLQ-MY20 is a 6-item questionnaire to assess the physical function of the participant, with a higher score indicating a higher level of symptoms., Up to 6 Months|Change from Baseline in Physical Functioning as Measured by the Physical Functioning Domain of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire - Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), The physical functioning domain of EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 5-item questionnaire to assess the physical function of the participant, with a higher score indicating worse functioning., Up to 6 Months|Time to Response (TTR), TTR is defined as the number of months from the date of first dose to the date of best overall response of CR or PR ('responders') determined by IMWG criteria as assessed by IRC., Up to Approximately 5 Years|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the number of days from the day the response criteria are met to the date that disease progression as determined by the IRC., Up to Approximately 5 Years|Time-to-Progression (TTP), TTP is defined as the number of days from the date of first dose to the date of earliest disease progression as determined by the IRC., Up to Approximately 5 Years|Time to Next Anti-lymphoma Therapy (TTNT), TTNT is defined as the time from randomization to first documented administration of subsequent anti-lymphoma therapy., Up to Approximately 5 Years|Number of Participants with Event-free Survival (EFS), EFS is defined as the time from randomization until adverse event determined by the IRC, or death, whichever occurs first., Up to Approximately 5 Years|Change from Baseline in Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Fatigue Short Form 7a (PROMIS Fatigue SF 7a), The PROMIS Fatigue SF7a is a 7-item short form that assesses the impact and experience of fatigue in the past 7 days. For each item, 5-point rating scales are used to measure frequency ("Never," "Rarely," "Sometimes," "Often," or "Always") with a higher score indicating a greater impact., Up to Approximately 6 Months|Change from Baseline in Patient Reported Outcomes-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE), The PRO-CTCAE is a patient-reported outcome measurement system developed to assess symptomatic toxicity in participants in cancer clinical trials. PRO-CTCAE items are scored from 0 to 4 to evaluate common symptoms from study treatment on their frequency, severity, interference, amount, presence/absence., Up to Approximately 6 Months|Change from Baseline in Remaining Items in the EORTC QLQ-C30, The EORTC QLQ-C30 assesses health-related quality of life in cancer patients participating in clinical trials. The EORTC QLQ-C30 comprises 5 functional scales (physical, role, emotional, social, cognitive), 8 single-item symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, insomnia, and dyspnea), as well as subscales assessing global health/quality of life and financial impact. Raw scores are transformed to a scale of 0 to 100, with higher scores representing better functioning/quality of life and greater symptom burden., Up to Approximately 6 Months|Change from Baseline in Remaining Items in the EORTC QLQ-MY20, The EORTC QLQ-MY20 consists of four scales: two symptom scales (Disease Symptoms \[6 items\] and Side Effects of Treatment \[10 items\]), one function scale (Future Perspective \[3 items\]), and one single item (Body Image).
