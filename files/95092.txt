Observational Study to Characterize the Incidence of EGFR Mutation Positive and Advanced NSCLC Patients
The present study has been designed in order to characterize the incidence of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) carrying epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) positive mutations and their clinical management in Galicia.
Metastatic Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer
Number of patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) positive mutation among advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients in Galicia, 10 months (recruitment period)
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutational status in tumor tissue (primary tumor or metastatic samples) and plasma samples at screening, 1 day (Screening Visit)|Type of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations: deletion in exon 19, point mutation at codon 858 (L858R) or other (only for EGFR M+ patients), 1 day (Screening Visit)|Prescribed first line treatment (only for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) M+ patients), 1 day (First study visit)|Tumor response (only for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) M+ patients), From inclusion until disease progression, death or until 9 months from the inclusion of the last patient in the study have elapsed, whichever is earlier.|Disease control (only for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) M+ patients), From inclusion until the end of the study (9 months subsequent to the last patient's inclusion or until lost of follow-up)|Prescribed second-line treatment after progression (only for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) M+ patients), 1 day (Progression Visit)|Progression-free survival and overall survival (only for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) M+ patients), 1 day (at the end of the study 9 months subsequent to the last patient's inclusion or until lost of follow-up|Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutational status at disease progression in tumor tissue (primary tumor or metastatic samples) and plasma samples (only for EGFR M+ patients), 1 day (Progresion Visit)
