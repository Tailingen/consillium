Postoperative VEGF and Recurrence After Colon Cancer Surgery
The purpose of this trial is to study the relationship between the angiogenic response to surgical aggression, determined through the serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) on postoperative day four, and the tumor recurrence in patients with colon cancer operated with a curative intention.
Angiogenesis|Colon Cancer|Surgery|Recurrence|VEGF Overexpression
PROCEDURE: Surgery for colon cancer with intention to cure
VEGF in serum on postop day 4, A 10cc sample of peripheral blood will be drawn on postoperative day 4, Postoperative day 4
DESIGN: Prospective multicentric study.

PARTICIPATION: Colorectal Surgery Units of Hospital del Mar, Barcelona; Hospital Universitari Joan XXIII, Tarragona; Hospital Universitari La Fe, Valencia; Hospital Clínico San Carlos, Madrid; Hospital General de Granollers, Granollers; Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Badalona; Athalaia, Xarxa Assistencial Universitària de Manresa, Manresa

STUDY SUBJECTS: 280 consecutive patients with non-metastatic colon cancer in whom a curative intent resection is performed.

DETERMINATIONS: Determination of the proangiogenic cytokine VEGF in serum on the postoperative day four to assess its relationship with oncological results on long-term follow-up.
