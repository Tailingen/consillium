Neuromodulation for Hypothalamic Obesity
The balance between hunger and satiety is imperative for an individual's survival and overall health.). Without this balance, individuals can become morbidly obese or lack adequate nutrition for survival. Craniopharyngioma (CP) is a benign tumour that occurs at the base of the brain in children. Unfortunately, pediatric neurosurgeons sometimes inadvertently destroy a child's satiety centre during CP tumour removal surgery. This leaves the child with a post-operative complication: an insatiable appetite. This form of obesity is called "hypothalamic obesity". This study is designed to investigate Deep Brain Stimulation for hypothalamic obesity in n=6 young adults who have stabilized tumours.

DEVICE: Hypothalamic Deep Brain Stimulation
Number of Participants With Adverse Events That Are Related to surgery and Post-Operative Side Effects, 12 months
Body Mass Index (BMI), Measuring BMI(kg/m\^2) following 12 months of constant stimulation, 12 months|Hyperphagia Questionnaire, Completion of hyperphagia questionnaire, 12 months|SF-36 Quality of Life Questionnaire, Completion of QoL Questionnaire, 12 months
For young adults with destroyed satiety centres due to childhood CP surgery, we believe directly re-balancing the brain's control of hunger and satiety is necessary for sustained and long-term therapy. n=6 patients will be recruited in this Phase 1 DBS trial. The proposed research will hope to improve personal health among the young adults involved in this study by improving quality of life and avoiding long-term cardiovascular morbidities. Furthermore, this study will elucidate what brain regions drive excessive hunger and develop a treatment that attempts to reverse these abnormalities.
