Erlotinib Combined With Radiotherapy in Patients With Non-resectable Locally Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (LA-NSCLC)
Concomitant chemoradiotherapy is the standard treatment of locally advanced,non-resectable, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However,the optimal chemotherapy regimen is still controversial.The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of a concomitant treatment using Erlotinib and radiotherapy followed by Erlotinib consolidation treatment.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Erlotinib|RADIATION: Thoracic radiotherapy
Tumor response rate (Response was analyzed according to the RECIST system, based on CT scans.), After the thoracic radiotherapy and concurrent Erlotinib treatment|The safety (The safety was evaluated according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 3.0.), Every one month
Progression free survival, The time from the start of treatment to diease progression|The overall survival, The time from the start of treatment to death|Quality of Life (QoL was evaluated according to the FACT-L.), Every one month
Patients with non-resectable Non-small Cell Lung Cancer will receive thoracic radiation therapy 60-70 Gy over 30-35 fractions and concurrent with Erlotinib 150mg/day. Followed by Erlotinib 150 mg/day consolidation treatment.
