Estimation of the Prevalence of HER2 Low and Describe the SoC, Treatment Patterns, and Outcome in Real-world Practice Among Unresectable and/or Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients With HER2 Low Status
This is a worldwide, multicenter, non-interventional, retrospective study of patient medical records from metastatic breast cancer (mBC) patients previously identified as human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2-neg), regardless of hormone status.
Breast Cancer
OTHER: None (Observational study)
Prevalence/Incidence of HER2 low among HER2-neg mBC patients, based on rescoring of historical HER2 fixed tissue IHC stained slides by Ventana 4B5 assay, To describe the overall prevalence and disease burden of HER2 low (IHC 1+, 2+/ISH-) among unresectable and/or mBC patients identified as HER2-neg, based on rescoring of historical HER2 fixed tissue IHC stained slides by Ventana 4B5 assay. The prevalence of HER2 low (IHC 1+, 2+/ISH-) at unresectable/metastatic BC diagnosis, determined based on rescoring of historical HER2 IHC slides locally, among patients confirmed to be HER2-neg (HER2 IHC zero and HER2 IHC 1+ and 2+/ISH-) by rescoring of historical HER2 IHC slides, will be calculated by the following, based on the re-established HER2 status determined for each patient:

Prevalence of HER2 low = (Number of patients with HER2 low)/(Total number of HER2 negative patients ), Retrospective: From 01 January 2015 to 31 December 2020|Disease outcome: Time to first subsequent treatment (TFST), To compare TFST between HER2 low BC patients and the HER2 IHC zero patient population. TFST is defined as the length of time from the initiation of treatment to the initiation of the patient's next systemic treatment., Retrospective: From 01 January 2015 to 31 December 2020|Disease outcome: Time to treatment failure (TTF), To compare TTF between HER2 low BC patients and the HER2 IHC zero patient population. TTF is defined as the length of time from initiation of treatment to premature discontinuation., Retrospective: From 01 January 2015 to 31 December 2020|Disease outcome: Overall survival (OS), To compare OS between HER2 low BC patients and the HER2 IHC zero patient population. OS is defined as the length of time from the initiation of treatment that patients are still alive., Retrospective: From 01 January 2015 to 31 December 2020
Clinicopathological characteristics in patients with HER2 low BC, HER2 low disease will be assessed using descriptive statistics of histopathological and clinicopathological characteristics. A comparison will be made with the HER2 IHC zero patient population., Retrospective: From 01 January 2015 to 31 December 2020|Concordance of HER2 rescore with historical HER2 score, The concordance between historical HER2 IHC scores and local lab rescoring in the HER2-neg region (IHC score zero, 1+, and 2+) will be characterized.

The concordance between historical scoringHER2 IHC scores and independent central retesting of HER2 IHC status in the HER2-neg region will be assessed using Cohen's Kappa statistics to assess agreement beyond chance alone. By convention, Kappa equal or greater than 0.8 is often considered almost perfect agreement, Kappa between 0.8 and 0.6 is considered substantial agreement., Retrospective: From 01 January 2015 to 31 December 2020|Prevalence of HER2 low among unresectable and/or mBC patients identified as HER2-neg based on other IHC assays, To describe HER2 low prevalence among unresectable and/or mBC patients identified as HER2-neg based on other IHC assays, compared with Ventana 4B5 assay., Retrospective: From 01 January 2015 to 31 December 2020|Prevalence of HER2 low in HR-positive and HR-negative population, The overall prevalence of HER2 low among unresectable and/or mBC patients identified as HER2-neg, regardless of assays used, will be summarized descriptively for HR-positive and HR-negative population, respectively., Retrospective: From 01 January 2015 to 31 December 2020
This is a worldwide, multicenter, non-interventional, retrospective study. The study will consist of 2 components. The first component involves local lab rescoring of qualified historical HER2 fixed tissue immunohistochemistry (IHC) stained slides (preferably using Ventana 4B5 assay) at sites (post-training) for mBC patients previously identified as HER2-neg, and independent central retesting of HER2 status using Ventana 4B5 assay for any enrolled patients with available archived tissue samples at designated central laboratories. Local lab rescoring and independent central retesting/local lab retesting will be conducted blinded of historical HER2 IHC scores.

The second component involves linking the rescored IHC status to the patient medical record either through registry databases or patient chart review. Such information will be used to describe the patient demographics, histopathological features, clinical presentation, and treatment patterns following mBC diagnosis, and clinical outcomes in real-world settings for all patients with HER2 scores of 0, \>0 and \< 1+, and 1+2+/ISH- (HER2 low). The clinicopathological and other relevant BC biomarker information will also be examined based on historical biomarker testing results and/or new testing conducted as part of this study.
