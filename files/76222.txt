K-RAS and EGFR in Lung Cancer
Retrospective analysis where patients with histologically confirmed Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were centrally evaluated for the presence of KRAS and EGFR mutations.

Progression free survival, from the date of treatment start until verified disease progression, death from any cause or date of last contact whichever occurred first, up to 9 months|Overall survival, from the date of treatment start until verified disease progression, death from any cause or date of last contact whichever occurred first, up to 36 months
A retrospective analysis, performed by the Hellenic Co-operative Oncology Group (HeCOG), in samples from patients with histologically confirmed NSCLC, who had been treated within HeCOG-affiliated centres from March 2000 through December 2012, were centrally evaluated for the presence of KRAS and EGFR mutations. All patients had available clinicopathological data at diagnosis. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were retrospectively retrieved from the HeCOG tumor repository. Cytologic material was prospectively submitted for genotyping in more recent years (2010-2012).
