A Pilot Trial of Tamoxifen and 4-HPR (4-N-Hydroxyphenyl Retinamide) in Persons at High Risk for Developing Breast Cancer
This is a pilot, chemoprevention study. Patients receive fenretinide daily for 25 of every 28 days for 4 months and tamoxifen daily for 23 months, beginning the second month of fenretinide.

Patients are removed from study for unacceptable toxicity, the development of invasive breast cancer, or for dysfunctional uterine bleeding.

This is a pilot chemo-prevention study of the combination tamoxifen and 4-HPR in persons at increased risk of developing invasive breast cancer. The objectives of the study are to determine the acute and cumulative toxicity of tamoxifen and 4-HPR in high risk persons; to assess the feasibility of obtaining adequate tissue to study potential intermediate biomarkers of proliferative disease and malignancy using nipple aspiration, four quadrant fine needle aspirates, and breast core needle biopsies; and to study the effects of tamoxifen and 4-HPR on TGF-beta isoforms and the proliferative markers ki67 and PCNA pre- and post-therapy.
