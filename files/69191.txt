Acute Pain Caused by Paclitaxel in Patients With Cancer
RATIONALE: Gathering information over time from patients receiving paclitaxel for cancer may help doctors learn more about pain caused by paclitaxel and plan the best treatment.

PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying acute pain caused by paclitaxel in patients with cancer.
Chemotherapeutic Agent Toxicity|Neurotoxicity|Pain|Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific
BEHAVIORAL: pain questionnaires
Maximum of the worst pain scores from the initiation of paclitaxel therapy (day 1) until day 7 (first week of therapy), Up to day 7
Maximum of the average pain score, Up to 12 months|Area under the curve of worst, average, and least pain, Up to 12 months|Worst pain reported for the overall week, Up to 12 months|Rate of non-prescription pain medication use, Up to 12 months|Rate of opioid use, Up to 12 months|Rate of other pain therapy use, Up to 12 months|Correlation of the worst pain score for the first dose of therapy with subsequent neuropathy scores, Up to 12 months
OBJECTIVES:

* To describe the incidence and characteristics of and change in pain related to paclitaxel infusions over several courses in patients receiving paclitaxel weekly or every 2-4 weeks with or without neurotoxic chemotherapy.
* To investigate the association between paclitaxel-induced acute pain syndrome symptoms and eventual chemotherapy-induced neuropathy.
* To perform exome-sequencing analysis and identify genetic variants that predict paclitaxel- induced peripheral neuropathy.
* To identify clinical phenotypes associated with paclitaxel toxicity (i.e., acute pain syndrome and neuropathy).
* To explore whether there are any evident differences between results seen in the majority Caucasian population and the minority populations.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are grouped according to paclitaxel dosing schedule (weekly vs every 2-4 weeks) and concurrent use of neurotoxic agent (yes vs no).

Blood samples are collected at baseline for correlative laboratory studies, including genetic biomarker and polymorphism studies.
