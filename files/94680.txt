TACE Plus Atezolizumab/Bevacizumab and I-125 Seeds Brachytherapy for HCC With Branch PVTT
The present study aimed to assess the effectiveness of the combination treatment of Atezolizumab/Bevacizumab, transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and I-125 Seeds Brachytherapy (TACE-AB-I) in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT). The investigators confirmed that the combination therapy yielded better survival data than the combined administration of Atezolizumab/Bevacizumab and TACE (TACE-AB) in patients with advanced HCC and Type I/II PVTT (Based on Cheng's PVTT classification).

This is a multicenter, open-label trial, randomized controlled to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TACE-AB-I compared with TACE-AB for the treatment of HCC with branch PVTT. 234 HCC patients with branch PVTT will be enrolled in this study. The Patients will be treated with TACE-AB-I or TACE-AB using a 1:1 randomization scheme. TACE will be performed for the patients after randomization. Atezolizumab/bevacizumab (1,200 mg atezolizumab plus 15 mg/kg bevacizumab intravenously every 3 weeks) will be started at 3-7 days after the first TACE and I-125 Seeds Brachytherapy and last until disease progresses, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of informed consent, loss of follow-up, death, or other circumstances that require termination of treatment, whichever occurs first. For patients in the TACE-AB-I arm, iodion-125 seeds will be implanted into the PVTT (according to the pre-operative planning) under CT guidance within 3-7 days after the first TACE. TACE and iodion-125 seeds implantation can be repeated on demand during follow-up based on the evaluation of laboratory and imaging examination.
