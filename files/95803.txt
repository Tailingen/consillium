A Phase 2, Open-label Trial of Consolidation Nivolumab After Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy in Locally Advanced Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
The clinical efficacy of nivolumab for locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients with residual disease after standard chemoradiotherapy is not known. In this study, we aim to investigate the role of nivolumab in locally advanced NPC after chemoradiotherapy the safety profile and antitumor activity of the anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor monoclonal antibody, nivolumab after in patients with advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma
Locally Advanced Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
DRUG: Nivolumab
Progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 2years, Progression-free survival rate at 2 years, which is the primary endpoint, will be measured by the proportion of patients who remain progression-free after 2 years of study registration., 2 years
Object response rate (ORR), according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, Screening, Every 3months during the administration period(up to 1year), every 6 months after the end of the administration(up to 5years)|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival will be followed continuously while subjects are on the study drug and every 6 months after discontinuation or progression for up to 5 years following the start of therapy either by direct contact (office visits) or via telephone contact, until death, withdrawal of study consent, or lost to follow-up., Intervals of 6 months up to 5 years after the end of dosing|Subject with Treatment Related Adverse Events as Assessed by CTCAE v5.0, The procedures and assessments may be performed as part of standard of care; however, data for these assessments should remain in the subject's medical record and should not be provided to Ono unless specifically requested. NCI CTCAE Version 5.0 will be the criteria used to assess adverse events., Every cycle (every 3weeks), until 28 days after the end of treatment.|Multiplexed biomarker analysis of tumor and immune cells in the TME, To understand correlated expressions of protein markers related to therapy response, multiplexed-image analysis (Vectra Polaris® and inForm®, PerkinElmer) is applied in tumor tissues, At screening, At cycle2 day1(each cycle is 28 days), End of treatment (up to a total of 1 year)|Analysis of gene expression profile and immune markers, Analysis of gene expression profile and immune markers with tissue and peripheral blood, At screening, At cycle2 day1(each cycle is 28 days), End of treatment (up to a total of 1 year)|Soluble factor analysis, Soluble factor analysis with blood: Cytokines related to adaptive immune responses, chemokines, and VEGF will be analyzed using the Cytometric Bead Assay (CBA) from serially collected plasma samples., At screening, At cycle2 day1(each cycle is 28 days), End of treatment (up to a total of 1 year)
Dosage within 12 weeks after the end of concurrent chemoradiation therapy. Nivolumab 360mg Intravenously administered every 3 weeks.

As a consolidation regimen, administration of Nivolumab is administered for up to a total of 1 year until disease progression or unacceptable to toxicity occurs.
