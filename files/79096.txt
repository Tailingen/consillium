Study of Anlotinib Plus Chemotherapy as the First-line Treatment in Patients With Advanced NSCLC
Non-small cell lung cancer has the highest morbidity and mortality in China，and platinum-based chemotherapy is the standard first-line treatment for the wild-type NSCLC,however the overall survival still less than one year.Anlotinib is a kinase inhibitor of receptor tyrosine with multi-targets, especially for VEGFR2、VEGFR3、PDGFRβ and c-Kit, which has strong effect of anti-angiogenesis.This study is aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination regimen of anlotinib plus platinum-based chemotherapy as first-line treatment for NSCLC.
