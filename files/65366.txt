Real-World Treatment Patterns and Outcomes Among Patients With Chronic Myeloid Leukemia in Earlier Lines of Therapy
This was a retrospective, non-interventional, observational cohort study using Optum's de-identified Clinformatics® Data Mart Database. Adult patients newly diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) were identified using the Optum database and classified into the following cohorts:

* First treatment cohort: Patients newly diagnosed with CML who received first treatment with a TKI.
* Second treatment cohort: Patients from first treatment cohort with a subsequent line of therapy (i.e., second treatment) with a TKI.

The observation period spanned from the start of data availability (i.e., 01 January 2007) to the earliest of end of data (i.e., 30 June 2022), end of continuous health plan enrollment, or death (if available). The index date was defined as the first treatment initiation for the first treatment TKI cohort and as the second treatment initiation for the second treatment TKI cohort. The baseline period consisted of the 6 months prior to the index date. The follow-up period started on the index date and ended at the earliest of end of observation period or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).
Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
Treatment Patterns, Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment management patterns in CML patients on first line or second line TKI were assessed., Up to approximately 10 years
Proportion of Days Covered (PDC), PDC was defined as the number of days of medication covered divided by the number of calendar days during the study period. The study period spanned from index date to the next line of therapy initiation (switch), hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), initiation of a CML-related chemotherapy for accelerated phase (AP)/blast crisis (BC) (day prior to HSCT/CML chemotherapy) or last supply day if treatment gap ≥ 90 days, whichever occurred first. The index date was defined as the first treatment initiation for the first treatment cohort and as the second treatment initiation for the second treatment cohort., Up to approximately 10 years|Number of Patients per PDC Category, PDC was defined as the number of days of medication covered divided by the number of calendar days during the study period.
