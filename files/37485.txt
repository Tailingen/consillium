Effectiveness of Manual Acupuncture and Standard Therapy Compared to Standard Therapy in Gynecological Cancer Pain
Cancer patients experience cancer pain as much as 66%. Cancer pain is pain that occurs in patients with neoplastic/malignancy and the source of the pain can come from malignant processes, treatments such as radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and surgery as well as other causes that are not related to malignancy processes. Unresolved pain can reduce the quality and life expectancy of cancer pain patients. The prevalence of cancer itself in Indonesia, the case of cervical cancer itself ranks second after breast cancer. In recent decades, acupuncture analgesics have been widely used to relieve cancer pain, and can also reduce the dose and side effects of analgesics.
