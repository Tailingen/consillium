Safety of 24-Hour Infusion of ON 01910.Na in Patients With Advanced Cancer
The primary purpose of this study is to determine the highest dose of ON 01910.Na that can be safely given as an intravenous infusion over 24 hours once a week in a 3-week cycle to patients with advanced solid tumors.

Number of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), DLTs are defined as:

* Grade 3 non-hematological toxicity other than nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, stomatitis, esophagitis/dysphagia.
* Recurrent grade 3 toxicity uncontrolled by optimal therapy or Grade 4 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and fever.
* Grade 3 stomatitis and/or esophagitis/dysphagia for \> 5 days.
* Grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia for \> 5 days measured at least 2X 2-3 days apart.
* Neutropenic fever, as defined in Protocol.
* Failure to recover neutrophils (\> 1,500 per microliter) or platelets (\>75,000 per microliter) before the next weekly dose., 21 days after first administration of ON 01910.Na
Number of Adverse Events (AEs), All AEs (except Grade 1 and 2 laboratories abnormalities that do not require an intervention) are recorded in Case Report Forms and source documentation., 30 days after last infusion of study drug|Severity of Adverse Events (AEs), Severity of AEs are determined according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (Version 3.0), 30 days after last infusion of study drug|Relationship of Adverse Events (AEs) to Study Treatment, Relationship assessed as Not related, Unlikely, Possibly, Probably, or, Definitely according to Guidance in Appendix II of Protocol., 30 days after last infusion of study drug|Concentration of ON 01910.Na in plasma versus time, Blood samples will be collected at following time points: Pre-dose; 1 h after start of infusion; 3 h; 6 h; 12 h; 18 h; 24 h; 10 min after end of infusion; 20 min; 30 min; 1 h; 2 h; 4 h; 8 h; 24 h; and, 48 h. Plasma will be prepared from these samples. Concentration of ON 01910.Na will be determined by validated method., Up to 48 hours after infusion of study drug during Week 1 in Cycles 1 and 2|Change in size of target lesions recorded at baseline, The same method of assessment for each identified and recorded lesion will be used at baseline and each follow-up., 30 days after last infusion of study drug
This is an open-label, dose-escalating Phase I study of ON 01910.Na in patients with advanced cancers, who have satisfied the inclusion/exclusion criteria enumerated in this protocol. Patients will receive ON 01910.Na intravenously by 24 hour continuous infusion once every week (3 weeks per cycle), until evidence of disease progression, intolerable adverse events, or withdrawal of patient consent. Safety monitoring will be done for at least 3 weeks before escalation to the next dose level. As of Amendment 7, up to 6 patients with gynecological malignancies will be enrolled at the 2400 mg/m2 dose level to determine the appropriateness of this dose as the Recommended Phase Two Dose (RPTD).
