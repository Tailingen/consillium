The Efficacy and Safety of Fluzoparib Plus Irinotecan as Second-line Treatment in Patients With Homologous Recombination Deficiency (HRD) Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.
Preclinical data support the investigation of PARP inhibitors in other neoplasms exhibiting homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) as monotherapy as well as in combination with chemotherapy. However，in colorectal cancer (CRC), the role of HRD alterations is mostly unknown. This study aims to explore the the Efficacy and Safety of Fluzoparib combined with Irinotecan in the Second-line treatment of HRD alterations metastatic colorectal cancer.
