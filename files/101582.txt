Preoperative Short-course Radiation Followed by Envafolimab Plus CAPEOX for MSS Locally Advanced Rectal Adenocarcinoma
Short-course radiotherapy combined with immunotherapy may bring revolutionary changes to the preoperative neoadjuvant treatment mode for locally advanced rectal cancer.In view of the shortcomings of the current preoperative neoadjuvant treatment model for locally advanced rectal cancer, we will explore the feasibility of a new model of short-course radiotherapy combined with immunotherapy, and develop a possible optimal plan based on the existing theoretical basis, namely "short-course radiotherapy + PD-L1 monoclonal antibody combined with CAPEOX chemotherapy for 2 cycles", and explore the efficacy and adverse effects of this model. The study will also attempt to explore the characteristics of the treatment beneficiary population, explore the characteristics of the treatment beneficiary population by multi-dimensional tumor and microenvironmental information through multi-omics sequencing analysis, attempt to build an efficacy prediction model, early screening of the treatment beneficiary population for precise treatment, and thus explore a new model of radiotherapy combined with immunotherapy.
Rectal Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Envafolimab
pCR rate, The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate following short-course radiation then Envafolimab Plus CAPEOX, Up to 10 weeks (once surgery is done) ]
Tumor regression grade, Tumor regression grade following short-course radiation then Envafolimab Plus CAPEOX as assessed by AJCC/CAP TRG system, Up to 10 weeks (once surgery is done)|OS, The proportion of participants who remain survival at 3 years, Up to 3 years|PFS, The proportion of participants who remain progression free at 3 years, Up to 3 years|TRAEs, Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by NCI-CTCAE v5.0, Up to 3 years|Surgical Complications, Surgical Complications of total mesorectal resection procedure for patients after short-course radiation then Envafolimab Plus CAPEOX as assessed by Clavien-Dindo classification, Up to 24 weeks|QoL, Quality of life of the patients in two neoadjuvant settings of short-course radiation followed with or without Envafolimab Plus CAPEOX as assessed by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Colorectal (FACT-C) questionnaire liscenced from The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy System ("FACIT System"). By using the Manual scoring template, some items are reverse scored. Subscale scores, total scores and TOI scores. The higher the score, the better the QOL., Up to 3 years
