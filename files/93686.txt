Donor Stem Cell Transplant With Treosulfan, Fludarabine, and Total-Body Irradiation for the Treatment of Hematological Malignancies
This phase II trial studies how well a donor stem cell transplant, treosulfan, fludarabine, and total-body irradiation work in treating patients with blood cancers (hematological malignancies). Giving chemotherapy and total-body irradiation before a donor stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cells in the bone marrow, including normal blood-forming cells (stem cells) and cancer cells. It may also stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient, they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The donated stem cells may also replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining cancer cells.

OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.

ARM A (HIGH DOSE TREOSULFAN): Patients receive high dose treosulfan intravenously (IV) over 120 minutes on days -6 to -4 and fludarabine IV over 60 minutes on days -6 to -2. Patients then undergo total-body irradiation on day -1 and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation on day 0. Patients then receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1-2 hours on days 3-4. Beginning on day 5, patients receive cyclosporine IV twice daily (BID) or three times daily (TID) over 1-2 hours or orally (PO) (after 3 months, in the absence of GVHD, cyclosporine tapering will start by 5-10% per week, until drug withdrawal at 6 months post-transplant). Beginning on day 5, patients also receive mycophenolate sodium PO TID or mycophenolate mofetil IV or PO TID until day 35 (may be continued if active GVHD is present). Beginning on day 5, patients also receive filgrastim until the absolute neutrophil count is \> 1,000/uL for 3 consecutive days. Additionally, patients undergo bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, and echocardiography at baseline and blood sample collection and computed tomography (CT) or positron emission tomography (PET)/CT on study.

ARM B (LOW DOSE TREOSULFAN): Patients receive low dose treosulfan IV over 120 minutes on days -6 to -4 and fludarabine IV over 60 minutes on days -6 to -2. Patients then undergo total-body irradiation and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and receive cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, mycophenolate sodium or mycophenolate mofetil, and filgrastim as in Arm A. Additionally, patients undergo bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, and echocardiography at baseline and blood sample collection and CT or PET/CT on study.

After completion of transplant, patients are followed up at 28, 56, 84, 365, and 730 days.
