Easing Psychosocial Burden for Informal Caregivers
The overall goal of this study is to determine the best time to offer Meaning-Centered Psychotherapy (MCP), an intervention that has proven to be helpful in improving spiritual well-being and decreasing existential distress among patients with advanced cancer, to caregivers. (MCP has also been shown to be an appropriate method of attending to the palliative or comfort care needs of caregivers of patients with cancer. Studies show that the psychological burden associated with caring for a patient with advanced cancer is often greater than that experienced by the patients themselves.) The investigators would also like to find out about caregivers initial impressions of MCP-C, Meaning-Centered Psychotherapy for Cancer Caregivers, so that the intervention can be adjusted to meet the unique needs of caregivers of patients with Glioblastoma.
