Evaluation of the Efficacy and the Safety of FOLFIRINOX3 Bevacizumab Treatment in Patients With Colorectal Cancer (FOLFIRINOX 3)
In patients in progression after oxaliplatin and irinotecan, the study FOLFIRINOX 3 proposes to evaluate the interest of modifying the standard pattern of administration of the molecule of irinotecan in order to make it more efficient. In combination with other chemotherapy drugs (5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, folinic acid and bevacizumab), irinotecan will be administered at the beginning and end of each cycle of chemotherapy, whereas it is normally administered at one time in the regimen. standard of treatment.

The hypothesis of this study is an increase in the objective response rate at 2 months of 10 to 30% with a scheme by FOLFIRINOX3 - bevacizumab compared to an optimal treatment to date by FOLFIRINOX-bevacizumab.
Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: FOLFIRINOX Bevacizumab
Number of Participants with Acute toxicities as a Measure of treatment specific Safety and Tolerability, Acute toxicities will be assessed according to the NCI CTCAE v4.03, each chemotherapy cycle (15 days) up to progression (6 months on average)
Primary objective

* Main objective of phase I: To evaluate the acute toxicity of treatment with FOLFIRINOX 3 - bevacizumab
* Main objective of phase II: To evaluate the efficacy of treatment with FOLFIRINOX 3 - bevacizumab in terms of objective response according to the RECIST criteria.

Secondary objectives

* To evaluate the efficacy of treatment with FOLFIRINOX 3 - bevacizumab in terms of objective response according to the criteria of CHOI, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)
* To evaluate the late toxicity of treatment with FOLFIRINOX 3 - bevacizumab
* Evaluate the quality of life
