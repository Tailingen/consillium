Imatinib TDM in GIST
Imatinib can lead to long recurrence free survival in patients diagnosed with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST); however side effects can significantly hinder quality of life for our patients. This study will use therapeutic drug monitoring to improve quality of life and symptoms and assess how many patients maintain therapeutic levels. Free drug levels and pharmokinetics of imatinib will also be monitored.
Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors
DRUG: Imatinib
Incidence of Grade 3/4 adverse events attributable to imatinib per CTCAE v5.0, To compare the incidence of Grade 3/4 adverse events attributable to imatinib per CTCAE v5.0 in patients who receive therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) with imatinib to a historical control., 6 months
Percent of patients achieving therapeutic levels of imatinib., Percent of patients achieving therapeutic levels of imatinib., 6 months|Quality of Life based on the EORTC QLQ-C30, Quality of Life will be assessed using the EORTC Core Quality of Life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30). The EORTC QLQ-C30 is designed to measure cancer patients' physical, psychological and social functions. It incorporates five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status, financial impact, and single items assessing additional symptoms. All scales and single-item measures are transformed so that scores range from 0-100; higher scores represent a higher response level., 6 months|Average dose of imatinib required to achieve therapeutic levels and drug dose over 3 years, 3 year
