Contrast-enhanced Ultrasound for Follow-up After Radiofrequency Ablation of Kidney Lesions
Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is an increasingly popular therapy option for treating small kidney cancer, especially for patients who are not ideal candidates for traditional surgery. Currently, follow-up after this procedure involves the patient having several CT scans (or MRI scans in some cases) over time to monitor for possible cancer recurrence. However, there are risks associated with the radiation exposure from CT scans and other risks, such as adverse events from the contrast media used in these scans. This study will therefore investigate whether a different technique, contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), can be an effective tool for follow-up monitoring of kidney cancer patients who have undergone RFA by comparing the results of their standard follow-up CT scans (or MRIs if applicable) with the results of CEUS. If CEUS is found to be just as effective as CT scans or MRIs in detecting kidney cancer recurrence, this technique could potentially become the new standard of care for follow-up.
