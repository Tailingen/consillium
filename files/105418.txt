Initial Oral Vinorelbine Dosing Schedules in Clinical Routine in Germany and Austria
The aim of this non-interventional study is to assess oral vinorelbine dose schedules (initial dose, dose increase/maintenance/reduction) applied during the initial 8 weeks of treatment under routine conditions in Germany together with the underlying reasons for the respective chosen schedules.

DRUG: Vinorelbine oral
Rate of patients with oral vinorelbine dose increase from ≤60 to ≥80 mg/m² during the course of the study, The outcome will be calculated together with its negative (i.e. the rate of patients without such dose increase). Reasons for increasing and for not increasing the dose will be analyzed., 8 weeks of treatment
