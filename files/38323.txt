Associations Among Serum and Gastric Juice Bile Acid Profile, Bile Acid-microbiota Cross-talk in Stomach and the Development of Gastric Cancer
To explore the associations among bile acid profile, bile acid-microbiota cross-talk and the development of gastric cancer, so as to better prevent the occurrence and development of gastric cancer
Bile Reflux|Gastric Cancer|Precancerous Lesion
corelation between the bile acid profile and gastric mucosa diseases, Investigators evaluate the corelation between the bile acid profile and gastric mucosa diseases according to the results of UPLC-MS/MS and pathological ., up to 6 months|corelation between the bile acid profile and gastric microbiota in different groups, Investigators explore the cross-talk between bile acid and gastric microbiota according to the results of 16s rRNA sequencing, up to 6 months
This study is a case-control study. Patients, according to the pathological results, will be consecutively enrolled and divided into gastric cancer group, gastric precancerous lesions group, and chronic gastritis group. The serum and gastric juice bile acid profiles, gastric microbial composition of each group patients will be detected.
