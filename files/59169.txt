Novel Window of Opportunity Trial to Evaluate the Impact of Statins to Oppose Prostate Cancer
This research study provides a novel opportunity to examine the intra-prostatic tumour inhibitory effects of statins in men with prostate cancer undergoing surgery.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Fluvastatin|DRUG: Pimonidazole
Pre and post treatment effect on the Ki-67 proliferation index, Week 8
Comparison of immunohistochemical staining in Biopsy and post-RP tissues, Will measure:

i. Apoptosis (caspase 3) ii. Signaling (Rap1A, Rap, RhoB) iii. Mevalonate pathway proteins (HMG-CoA reductase, HMG-CoA synthase, SREBP1/2, mevalonate decarboxylase, GGPS1, GGT, FT) iv. Tumour Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TILs), CD3 (T-cells), CD20 (B-cells), CD68 (macrophages), CD56 (NK cells), IDO (negative control)) v. Growth and survival signaling (AKT, P-AKT, ERK, P-ERK), Week 8
