Radiotherapy in Combination With Checkpoint Inhibition for Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer
To evaluate progression of metastatic renal cell carcinoma from the initiation of PULSAR radiotherapy in combination with IMSA101 injectable onward.
Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma ( mRCC)|OligoProgressive Metastatic Disease
DRUG: IMSA101
To evaluate the PFS rate associated with the therapeutic intervention. PFS is defined as the duration of time from initiation of PULSAR/IMSA101 to disease progression as defined by RECIST1.1 or death., Exact binomial test will be used to test if the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval of the probability of postponing systemic therapy \&amp;amp;gt;9 months will be greater than 40%., Time from initiation of PULSAR/IMSA101 until death from any cause.Follow-up visits to be done every 12 weeks (+/- 1 week) for study duration until patient has progressed. Afterward,subjects to be contacted every 3 months for survival data,up to 4 years
The study expects to accrue the 20 patients over a 3-4 year period.

Patients with oligoprogressive disease (1-3 lesions) after treatment with Anti-PD1 / Anti-CTLA-4 will continue Anti-PD1 (nivolumab). All patients will have a mandatory PD-L1 PET (Pre-treatment and Week 12). All patients will undergo baseline biopsy (just before the administration of IMSA101 of the same lesion to be injected). SAbR will be delivered in 3 fractions at 12 Gy every 4 weeks (PULSAR regimen) to all progressing lesions. One lesion will also receive 5 intratumoral injections of IMSA101 (C1D1, C1D8, C1D15, C2D1, C3D1) immediately after radiation either on the same day or within 72 hours after the PULSE.

Selected Phase 2 dosing of IMSA101 (1200mcg) will be utilized.

At disease progression, patients have the option to undergo additional imaging and tissue/blood collections.
