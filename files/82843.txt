Neoadjuvant Carilizumab and Apatinib for Recurrent High-Grade Glioma
GBM is the most common intracranial tumor in adults, accounting for about 40% of all primary intracranial tumors.Although surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy have been used, the prognosis of glioma patients is still very poor. The study aim to Evaluate the Safety and efficiency of Using the neoadjuvant therapy with Carilizumab and Apatinib in patients with Recurrent High-Grade Glioma.
