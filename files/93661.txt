Pifenidone Prophylactic Therapy for Radiation Lung Injury in Patients Who Have Previously Received Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors
Patients with advanced lung cancer who have previously received immunocheckpoint inhibitor therapy, undergone chest radiation therapy again have developed radiation induced lung injury. Pirfenidone has anti-inflammatory and anti fibrosis effects. This study is intended to evaluate the effectiveness of pirfenidone combined with radiotherapy in the prevention of radiation pneumonitis.
Lung Cancer
DRUG: Pirfenidone
Incidence rate of radiation pneumonia ≥ grade 2 (1 month, 3 month, 6 month), Incidence rate of radiation pneumonia ≥ grade 2 (1 month, 3 month, 6 month), up to 6 month
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Defined as percentage of participants achieving assessed complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) by the investigator according to the RECIST 1.1., up to 6 month|Disease Control Rate （DCR）, DCR was defined as the percentage of participants who have a confirmed complete response（CR） or partial response（PR） or stable disease（SD） per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by investigator, up to 6 month|6 month progression-free-survival (PFS) rate, PFS is defined as the time from enrollment to the first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Responses are according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as assessed by investigator, up to 6 month|Treatment-related adverse events, overall incidence of adverse events (AE); incidence of grade 3 or higher AE; incidence of severe adverse events (SAE); incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation of drug use; incidence of AEs leading to suspension of drug use., up to 6 month
