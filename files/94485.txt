Safety and Efficacy of Lenvatinib (E7080/MK-7902) in Combination With Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) Versus Lenvatinib as First-line Therapy in Participants With Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma (MK-7902-002/E7080-G000-311/LEAP-002)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lenvatinib (E7080/MK-7902) in combination with pembrolizumab (MK-3745) versus lenvatinib in combination with placebo as first-line therapy for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma in adult participants.

The primary hypotheses of this study are that lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab is superior to lenvatinib plus placebo with respect to progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).
Carcinoma, Hepatocellular
DRUG: lenvatinib|BIOLOGICAL: pembrolizumab|DRUG: saline placebo
Progression-free Survival (PFS) Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), PFS was defined as the time from the date of the first documentation of disease progression, as determined by blinded independent central review (BICR) per RECIST 1.1 or death due to any cause (whichever occurred first). Disease progression was defined as at least 20 percent (%) increase (including an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeter \[mm\]) in the sum of diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions and/or appearance of 1 or more new lesions. PFS was estimated and analyzed using Kaplan-Meier method., Up to approximately 41 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from randomization until death from any cause, Up to approximately 41 months
Objective Response Rate (ORR) Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who have a confirmed complete response (CR: disappearance of all target lesions) or partial response (PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters) per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR. RECIST 1.1 has been modified for this study to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ., Up to approximately 41 months|Duration of Response (DOR) Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), DOR was determined by disease assessment and is defined as the time from the first documented evidence of a response of CR or PR, per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR, until the first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. RECIST 1.1 has been modified for this study to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ., Up to approximately 41 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR) Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), DCR was defined as the percentage of participants who have a best overall response of CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR. SD must be achieved at ≥6 weeks after randomization to be considered best overall response. RECIST 1.1 has been modified for this study to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ., Up to approximately 41 months|Time to Disease Progression (TTP) Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), TTP was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR. RECIST 1.1 was modified for this study to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ were followed., Up to approximately 41 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS) Per Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST), PFS was defined as the time from the first dose of study intervention to the first documented progressive disease (PD) per mRECIST by BICR or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. mRECIST for HCC allowed evaluation of treatment effects that were not reflected in simple total size changes of lesions. Per mRECIST, PD was defined as an increase of at least 20% in the sum of diameters (SODs) of viable (enhancing) target lesions, taking as reference the smallest SODs of viable (enhancing) target lesions recorded since the treatment started., Up to approximately 41 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR) Per Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST), ORR wass defined as the percentage of participants who have a confirmed complete response (CR: disappearance of any intratumoral arterial enhancement in all target lesions) or partial response (PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of viable \[enhancement in the arterial phase\] target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of the diameters of target lesions) per mRECIST as assessed by BICR. mRECIST for hepatocellular carcinoma evaluates lesions within the liver parenchyma showing increased contrast enhancement in the arterial phase. A maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ were followed., Up to approximately 41 months|Duration of Response (DOR) Per Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST), DOR was determined by disease assessment and is defined as the time from the first documented evidence of a response of CR or PR, per mRECIST as assessed by BICR, until the first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. mRECIST for hepatocellular carcinoma evaluates lesions within the liver parenchyma showing increased contrast enhancement in the arterial phase.

A maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ were followed., Up to approximately 41 months|Number of Participants Who Experienced an Adverse Event (AE), Number of participants who experienced an AE defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, disease, or worsening of preexisting condition temporally associated with study therapy and irrespective of causality to study treatment, Up to approximately 41 months|Number of Participants Who Experienced an Serious Adverse Event (SAE), Number of participants who experienced a SAE defined as an AE that resulted in death, was life threatening, resulting in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, resulting in or prolonged a hospitalization, was a congenital anomaly or birth defect, was a cancer, was associated with an overdose, or was another important medical event, Up to approximately 41 months|Number of Participants Who Experienced an Immune-related Adverse Event (irAE) of Clinical Interest, Number of participants who experienced an AE representing an immunologic etiology and considered to be causally related to drug exposure, Up to approximately 41 months|Number of Participants Who Experienced an Hepatic Event of Clinical Interest (HECI), Number of participants who experienced a hepatic ECI not due to disease progression as judged by the investigator., Up to approximately 41 months|Number of Participants Who Discontinued Study Drug Due to an Adverse Event, Number of participants who discontinued study treatment due to an AE, Up to approximately 41 months
