Ontegimod and Gemcitabine/Nab-paclitaxel as Second Line Therapy for Metastatic Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma
The investigators hypothesize that CD11b agonism reprograms the tumor microenvironment (TME) to overcome resistance to checkpoint immunotherapy in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Therefore, the investigators propose an open label phase I/II clinical trial of Ontegimod with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in unresectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma prior to future studies incorporating anti-PD1 checkpoint immunotherapy.
Metastatic Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: Ontegimod|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Nab paclitaxel
Recommended phase II dose (RP2D) (Phase I only), The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the dose level immediately below the dose level at which 2 patients of a cohort (of 2 to 6 patients) experience dose-limiting toxicity during the first cycle. In the absence of excess toxicity, the maximum tolerated dose will become the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D)., After completion of cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 day) for all Phase I participants (estimated to be 12 months)|Number of participants with dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) (Phase I only), DLTs are defined in the protocol., After completion of cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 day)|Progression-free rate at 6 months (RP2D participants in Phase I and Phase II participants only), At 6 months from start of treatment
Frequency of adverse events (RP2D participants in Phase I and Phase II participants in experimental arm only), - The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 will be utilized for all toxicity reporting., From start of treatment through 30 days after last dose of treatment (estimated to be 7 months)|Objective response rate (ORR) (RP2D participants in Phase I and Phase II participants in experimental arm only), * ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with disease control (Complete response + Partial response).
* Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level.
* Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., Through completion of treatment (estimated to be 6 months)|Progression-free survival (PFS) (RP2D participants in Phase I and Phase II participants in experimental arm only), * PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first.
* Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions., Through completion of follow-up (estimated to be 18 months)|Overall survival (OS) (RP2D participants in Phase I and Phase II participants in experimental arm only), OS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of death from any cause. The alive patients are censored at last follow-up date., Through completion of follow-up (estimated to be 18 months)|Disease control rate (DCR) (RP2D participants in Phase I and Phase II participants in experimental arm only), * DCR is defined as the proportion of patients with disease control (Complete response + Partial response + Stable Disease) per RECIST 1.1.
* Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level.
* Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.
* Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study., Through completion of follow-up (estimated to be 18 months)
