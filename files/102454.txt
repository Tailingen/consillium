Phase 2 Study of MPDL3280A Combined With CDX-1401 in NY-ESO 1 (+) IIIB, IV or Recurrent Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
The primary purpose of this study is to look at effects, good or bad, of combining two investigational anti-cancer drugs called MPDL3280A and CDX-1401. CDX-1401 is given in combination with a third agent, poly-ICLC, which is another investigational drug that is believed to work together with CDX-1401. All investigational drugs, MPDL3280A and CDX-1401 in conjunction with poly-ICLC, have been evaluated separately in prior studies; however, this is the first study assessing the combination therapy.
