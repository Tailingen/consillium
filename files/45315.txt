Randomized Clinical Trial Aimed at Comparing Unclamped Robotic Partial Nephrectomy With or Without Renorrhaphy
Intended to minimize ischemia during robotic partial nephrectomy (RPN) procedures "by any means possible".

Before starting enucleation, the boundaries of the tumor are marked during SL-ocRPN surgery cautery. Once the tumor is removed, the resection bed is cauterized by dispensing monopolar energy with "quasi-contact" mode, and hemostasis is progressively improved.
Kidney Cancer
PROCEDURE: Robotic partial nephrectomy
Trifecta rate, The Trifecta rate \[defined as negative surgical margins, no major complications, no \>30% glomerular filtration rate reduction\] will be assessed and used to compare outcomes in the 2 arms.

Then prospectively demonstrate that sutureless (SL) ocRPN is non-inferior to RR ocRPN in terms of surgical outcome., 36 months
Direct costs, To prospectively compare direct costs associated with ocRPN with or without RR. For the purposes of the study, the out-of-pocket costs of the study, of the robotic instruments used, will be systematically recorded and used to estimate the direct costs associated with ocRPN with or without RR and the two surgical approaches will be compared accordingly., 36 months
Since RR impacts postoperative renal function, we believe the use of cautery instead of suture of the parenchymal breach after tumor enucleation provides at least postoperative functional results not lower, shorten the intervention time and reduce the direct costs associated with the procedure.

Based on available pilot studies, SL-ocRPN is safe, fast, and both the transfusion rate and duration of the hospital stay are not affected by the lack of renorrhaphy at the end of the enucleation. At the same time, this surgical approach does not require the use of a robotic needle holder and this can result in a reduction of direct costs related to treatment.

Furthermore, based on the preliminary data available, the rate of positive surgical margins would also not result influenced by the absence of RR and the risk of local recurrence could even be reduced by the extended one coagulation of the tumor bed after enucleation.
