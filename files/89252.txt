Triple Antigen vs Monoantigen Immunotherapy for Warts
Warts can be resistant to treatment or return despite the use of many therapeutic modalities. Combining immunotherapy might contribute to better response rates, particularly in recalcitrant warts, which is a real therapeutic challenge. The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness and safety of a triple intralesional immunotherapy combination composed of PPD, Candida antigen and MMR versus either agent alone in the management of multiple recalcitrant warts.
Triple Intralesional Immunotherapy Combination in Multiple Recalcitrant Warts
BIOLOGICAL: Intralesional antigen immunotherapy
Overall complete response of both treated and distant warts, within 12 weeks of starting treatment sessions (up to 1 month after the last session, maximum 5 sessions)|Immediate adverse effects, during and till 20 minutes after intralesional injection immunotherapy
Distant wart clearance, within 12 weeks of starting sessions|Time to complete clearance, within 12 weeks of starting therapy|late adverse effects, after each session and till the end of sessions and 6 months-follow-up period|Recurrence, For 6 months after complete response
This study included 160 patients with multiple (\>3 warts) recalcitrant (at least 6 months duration and who did not respond to at least 2 treatment modalities) warts of different sites, size and duration, with or without distant warts after approval of the Institutional Review Board of Faculty of medicine, Zagazig university. They were randomly assigned to one of four groups (each with 40 patients): PPD, Candida antigen, MMR, or combination of the 3 antigens. Injections into the biggest wart were repeated every two weeks until clearance or for a total of five sessions.
