Prevention of Urinary Incontinence After Prostatectomy
Urinary incontinence is a frequent complication after radical prostatectomy. Rehabilitative treatments are frequently utilized to reduce incontinence. However, their efficacy has not been completely investigated. In this study the investigators will compare the effect of an early rehabilitation programme (instruction of the patient, pelvic floor muscle training, electrical stimulation and biofeedback) versus instruction of the patient only.

The investigators hypothesis is that early rehabilitation programme is more effective than patient's instruction alone in preventing urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy.
