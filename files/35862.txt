Clinical Study of Pabolizumab for Neoadjuvant Immunotherapy of Locally Advanced Microsatellite-unstable Gastric Adenocarcinoma
Our study is aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pabolizumab in neoadjuvant immunotherapy of locally advanced microsatellite-unstable gastric adenocarcinoma.
Gastric Cancer|Gastric Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: pabolizumab
Pathologic Complete Response (pCR) Rate, pCR is defined as absence of viable tumor (pT0pT0N0) in examined tissue, Up to approximately 15 Weeks (Time of surgery)
Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause., Up to approximately 71 months.|Progression free survival (PFS), The time from registration to the date of disease progression or death resulting from any cause., 3 years.|R0 resection rate, Proportion of patients who achieved R0 resection., Within 4 weeks following the operation.
Patients with microsatellite-unstable gastric adenocarcinoma cannot benefit from chemotherapy, According to the guideline of the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology, It is not recommended to receive chemotherapy for patients with microsatellite-unstable gastric cancer, therefore, immunotherapy is the only hope for those patients.
