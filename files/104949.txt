Efficacy and Safety Study of Navarixin (MK-7123) in Combination With Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in Adults With Selected Advanced/Metastatic Solid Tumors (MK-7123-034)
The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of navarixin (MK-7123) in combination with pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in adults with one of three types of solid tumors: Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) positive refractory non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) or microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal cancer (CRC).

DRUG: Navarixin|BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab
Objective Response Rate (ORR) Based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who have a Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1. ORR was estimated using an exact method based on the binomial distribution, and the 95% confidence interval was estimated by the method of Clopper-Pearson., Up to approximately 2 years|Number of Participants With Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs) During Treatment Cycle 1, The following toxicities are considered a DLT, assessed as related to study treatment: Grade 4 non-hematologic toxicity, Grade 4 anemia, Grade 3 anemia lasting \>7 days or requiring transfusion, Grade 4 hematologic toxicity lasting ≥7 days, except thrombocytopenia, a) Grade 4 thrombocytopenia of any duration, b) Grade 3 thrombocytopenia associated with bleeding, Grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity lasting \>3 days, any Grade 3 or Grade 4 non-hematologic laboratory value if: medical intervention is required or the abnormality leads to hospitalization or persists for \>72 hours, Liver test abnormalities: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) \>3X Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) with total bilirubin (TBL) \>2X ULN with no elevation in alkaline phosphatase (AP \<2X ULN), Grade 3 or Grade 4 febrile neutropenia, inability to administer ≥75% of the planned navarixin dose due to drug-related tolerability, delay in Cycle 2 start by \>2 weeks due to toxicity, Up to 21 days|Number of Participants Who Experience at Least One Adverse Event (AE), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study treatment., Up to approximately 27 months|Number of Participants Who Discontinue Study Treatment Due to an AE, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study treatment., Up to approximately 2 years
Objective Response Rate (ORR) Per Modified RECIST 1.1 for Immune-based Therapeutics (iRECIST), An objective response is defined as an immune-based Complete Response (iCR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or immune-based Partial Response (iPR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions). ORR will be assessed by the investigator based on iRECIST following administration of navarixin in combination with pembrolizumab. The percentage of participants with progressive disease per RECIST 1.1 who experience an iCR or iPR are presented., Up to approximately 2 years|Progression-free Survival (PFS) Per RECIST 1.1, PFS is defined as the time from the first dose of study treatment to the first confirmed documented disease progression, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST 1.1, progressive disease is defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. Note: The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression. Median PFS per RECIST 1.1 was assessed by the investigator from product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) method for censored data in participants with microsatellite stable colorectal cancer (CRC); with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), and with programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-\[L\]1) refractory non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)., Up to approximately 2 years|PFS Per iRECIST, PFS is defined as the time from the first dose of study treatment to the first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Per iRECIST, progressive disease (PD) is defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. Disease progression is to be confirmed by a consecutive assessment at least 4-8 weeks after first documentation and will be assessed by the investigator. Median PFS per iRECIST was assessed by the investigator from product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) method for censored data in participants with microsatellite stable colorectal cancer (CRC); with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), and with programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-\[L\]1) refractory non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)., Up to approximately 2 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the first dose of study treatment to death due to any cause. Median OS was assessed from product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) method for censored data in participants with microsatellite stable colorectal cancer (CRC); with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), and with programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-\[L\]1) refractory non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)., Up to approximately 2 years|Absolute Neutrophil Counts (ANC), Peripheral blood neutrophil counts were performed at Cycle 1 Day 3: Predose, to determine the concentration of ANC., Day 3: Predose|Navarixin Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve (AUC) From Time 0 to Infinity (AUC0-inf), Plasma samples from participants with selected advanced/metastatic solid tumors were collected to determine the navarixin plasma AUC0-inf, Cycle 1 Day 1: Predose & 1, 2, 4, 6 & 8-12 hours postdose; Cycle 1 Days 3 & 8: Predose & 6-12 hours postdose; Cycle 2 Day 1: Predose & 1, 2, 4, 6 & 8-12 hours postdose (Up to approximately 23 days)|Navarixin Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve From Time 0 to Last (AUC0-last), Plasma samples from participants with selected advanced/metastatic solid tumors were collected to determine the navarixin plasma AUC0-last., Cycle 1 Day 1: Predose & 1, 2, 4, 6 & 8-12 hours postdose; Cycle 1 Days 3 & 8: Predose & 6-12 hours postdose; Cycle 2 Day 1: Predose & 1, 2, 4, 6 & 8-12 hours postdose(Up to approximately 23 days)|Navarixin Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Plasma samples from participants with selected advanced/metastatic solid tumors were collected to determine the navarixin plasma Cmax., Cycle 1 Day 1: Predose & 1, 2, 4, 6 & 8-12 hours postdose; Cycle 1 Days 3 & 8: Predose & 6-12 hours postdose; Cycle 2 Day 1: Predose & 1, 2, 4, 6 & 8-12 hours postdose (Up to approximately 23 days)|Navarixin Trough Plasma Concentration (Ctrough), Plasma samples from participants with selected advanced/metastatic solid tumors were collected at steady state on Cycle 2 Day 21 to determine navarixin Ctrough. The Arithmetic Mean and CV% are presented., Cycle 2 Day 21 (Up to approximately 43 days)
