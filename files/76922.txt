Absorption, Metabolism, and Excretion Following a Single Oral Dose of [14C]-Rucaparib
The purpose of this study is to characterize the mass balance, absorption, metabolism, and elimination pathways of orally administered \[14C\] rucaparib followed by cycle by cycle treatment with rucaparib continuing until disease progression or other reason for discontinuation

Tolerability and safety of rucaparib assessed by incidence of Adverse Events (AEs), clinical laboratory abnormalities, and dose modifications, Incidence of Adverse Events (AEs), clinical laboratory abnormalities, and dose modifications, From cycle 1 Day 1 until radiologically confirmed disease progression, death, or initiation of subsequent treatment whichever comes first up to 52 weeks
To evaluate the antitumor activity of rucaparib in BRCA mutated solid tumors based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1, Response will be determined using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 and tumor markers per applicable criteria for a given tumor type, Cycle 1 Day 1 until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or discontinuation for other reasons
This is a Phase 1, open-label, non-randomized, mass balance study in patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced solid tumors. Approximately 6 patients will be enrolled. The study will consist of 2 parts: a mass balance part (Part I) and a rucaparib treatment part (Part II).

Each patient will receive a single oral dose of 600 mg \[14C\] rucaparib (approximately 140 ÂµCi) in the fasted state. Patients will be confined at the study site for the collection of blood samples and excreta for a maximum of 13 days, from Day -1. The patient can be discharged sooner than Day 13, if the discharge criteria are met. If the cumulative recovery of radioactivity exceeds 90% of the administered dose or if radioactivity in urine and feces is \< 1% of the administered dose over a 24 hour period on two consecutive days, as determined by quick counts.

In Part II, the treatment with rucaparib in 28-day cycles will continue until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or other reason for discontinuation.
