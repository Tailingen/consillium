Mammography and Breast Arterial Calcification: an Information-Sharing Trial
The purpose of this research study is to determine the potential benefits of adding information on patients' breast arterial calcification (BAC) results to the standard results letter women receive after mammography. In addition to looking for potential breast cancer, research shows that mammograms can also detect the presence of calcifications within the breast arteries. Those calcifications can be associated with coronary artery disease. Right now, women are not routinely told whether or not they have BAC; that is, it's not part of standard practice to communicate that information to patients. However, previous research has suggested that patients would like to be informed about their BAC status more often. In this study, the team has two goals. First, the team wants to measure the rates of BAC in a large, diverse group of 14,875 women. Because most of the past research on BAC has largely been focused on White mammography patients, the researchers feel it is important to see if the results are similar or different in a more racially and ethnically diverse sample.

Second, the study team wants to understand the effects of giving women information on their BAC results as part of their standard post-mammography letter. Specifically, the study team wants to see how sharing that information might affect women's healthcare choices and lifestyle. The research will include 1,888 women in this second part of the study, which will be the first in the literature to explore women's reactions to BAC information. If research shows that women find the information useful, BAC information may be given to women regularly in the future.

Attendance at a cardiovascular appointment, Patients will be asked a YES/NO question asking them to report whether they have seen a healthcare provider to talk about their heart or coronary artery disease in the last six months. Patient's self-report responses will be confirmed via medical record review., Month 6
Healthy Heart Score, The Healthy Heart Score is a survey to assess patients' heart healthy behaviors. It assesses age, smoking, body mass index, exercise, alcohol, and a composite diet score. A higher score indicates a greater risk of cardiovascular disease.

Score has gender-specific algorithm that estimates 20-year CVD risk (https://healthyheartscore.sph.harvard.edu/) (DOI: 10.1161/JAHA.114.000954):

The item will be rated as, "yes, no, or don't know."
