Survival Effect of Hepato-celiac Lymphadenectomy In Primary or Relapsed Ovarian Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and the effectiveness of hepato-celiac lymphadenectomy in the treatment of primarily diagnosed advanced epithelial ovarian cancer and platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer.
Epithelial Ovarian Cancer|Fallopian Tube Cancer|Primary Peritoneal Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: Hepato-celiac lymphadenectomy
2-years Non-Progression Rate, The proportion of patients without disease progression or death at 2 years after entry into the study., Participants will be followed up to 2 years after randomization
Progression free survival, The time from entry into the study to the diagnosis of the first progression or recurrence or death, whichever occurs first, Participants will be followed up to 24 months after randomization|Overall survival, The time from date of randomization until the date of death from any cause or last follow-up, Participants will be followed up to 60 months after randomization|Objective response rate, The proportion of patients who achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), Participants will be followed up to 24 months after randomization|Disease control rate, The proportion of patients who achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD), Participants will be followed up to 24 months after randomization|Post-operative complications, Postoperative 30-day, 60-day and 90-day complications, Participants will be followed up to 90 days after randomization|Quality of life assessments (QLQ-C30), Assessment of potential impact of first line treatment on functionality and well-being in patients by the EORTC core quality of life questionnaire (QLQ-C30, version 3.0)., Baseline; 6 months, 12 months and 24 months after randomization|Quality of life assessments (FACT-Q), Assessment of potential impact of first line treatment on functionality and well-being in patients by functional assessment of cancer therapy-ovary (FACT-O, version 4)., Baseline; 6 months, 12 months and 24 months after randomization|Patterns of subsequent recurrence, The number and sites of subsequent recurrence, including pelvic, abdominal, retroperitoneal lymph nodes, hepato-celiac lymph nodes and distant metastases and ascites, etc., Participants will be followed up to 24 months after randomization
This single-arm, single-center, phase II trial is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of hepato-celiac lymphadenectomy in the treatment of ovarian cancer with hepato-celiac lymph nodes metastases, in the circumstance of primarily diagnosed advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (primary debulking surgery or interval debulking surgery) and of platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer (no more than 4 lines of therapy).
