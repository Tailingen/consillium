Tc99m Macroaggregated Albumin Bronchial Artery Study
This is a single-arm, single-center, prospective pilot study to perform bronchial artery Tc-99m-MAA infusion to determine the predicted whole lung versus lung tumor dosimetry of a possible intra-arterial radioembolization.
Hemoptysis|Malignant Neoplasm|Lung Cancer
PROCEDURE: Technicium 99 MAA infusion
Quantification of Tc99m-MAA uptake, The primary objective will be quantification of Tc99m-MAA uptake (measured in "Gray") within the tumor and surrounding structures (esophagus, bronchi, pericardium, spine). This is a purely descriptive study and no statistical comparison or correlation will be made. This assessment will be done for each participant at 12 months., 12 months
This study is a prospective, single-arm pilot study for patients presenting with hemoptysis from lung cancers. Prior to a therapeutic bronchial artery embolization (standard therapy), Tc99m-MAA will be administered to the bronchial artery and an imaging will be obtained to determine the distribution of MAA.

The primary objective will be quantification of Tc99m-MAA uptake within the tumor and surrounding structures (esophagus, bronchi, pericardium, spine). This is a purely descriptive study and no statistical comparison or correlation will be made. Dosimetry will be reported for each patient, as well as range and mean with standard deviation. Additional activity calculation methods and reporting metrics may additionally be used. Non-statistical comparison will be made to literature-reported external-beam radiation dose-related tumor response and adjacent-organ toxicities to develop a preliminary assessment of the potential for efficacy and anticipated safety-profile of Yittrium-90 bronchial artery radio-embolization.
