Benefit of Chemotherapy Over Best Supportive Care in Metastatic and Squamous Cell-type Esophageal Cancer.
Interest of continuing systemic chemotherapy or not , after a short initial treatment (6 weeks) in patients who are in response or stable disease("Discontinuation design ")of patients with metastatic oesophageal cancer of squamous cell type

The secondary aims would be to study : toxicity, the overall survival rate, a study of costs and quality of life.
Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Esophagus
DRUG: FU-CDDP|DRUG: LV5FU2-CDDP|DRUG: FOLFOX|DRUG: TPF|OTHER: Best Supportive Care
Overall survival, Between the date of randomisation and the date of death
Progression free survival, Between the date of randomisation and the date of progression|Tolerance, According to the NCI-CTCAE V4.0 grading scale, At each visit : every 6 weeks|Quality of life by QLQ-C30, EOTRC QLQ-C30 questionnaire and the oesophagus QLQ-OES18 module

EQ-5D questionnaire, Every 6 weeks|Cost analysis, Data collected :

* Hospitalization
* day hospital visit
* Chemotherapy drugs administered
* Home medical care
* Radiotherapy
* Oncologist visits, General Practitioner Visits
* Laboratory and radiologic tests, Every 6 weeks
As the data in litterature does not provide the basis for well-argued statistical hypothesis, it is suggested to randomize 30 patients per arm. An IDMC will come to a decision after the inclusion of 10, 20 ans 40 patients on the efficacy and the toxicity profile and on whether to maintain the current clinical position, justifying randomisation . In order to take into account any possible effects of prior concomitant radiochemotherapy, patient will be stratified according to whether they have already undergone chemotherapy or radiochemotherapy.
