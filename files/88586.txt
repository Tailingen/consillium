Study of Zanubrutinib, Obinutuzumab, and Venetoclax in Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) or Small Lymphocytic Leukemia (SLL)
The purpose of this study is to determine the rate of minimum residual disease (MRD) negative response (i.e. the rate of no evidence of disease) of the study drugs, zanubrutinib, obinutuzumab, and venetoclax, given in combination as a treatment for CLL and/or SLL.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)|Small Lymphocytic Leukemia (SLL)
DRUG: Zanubrutinib|DRUG: Obinutuzumab|DRUG: Venetoclax
establish the rate of minimum residual disease (MRD) undetectable response, Patients will have their minimum residual disease (MRD) response classified by bone marrow peripheral blood flow cytometry with a sensitivity of 10-4., 1 year
