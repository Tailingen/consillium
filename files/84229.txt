A Study of GDC-0980 in the Treatment of Recurrent or Persistent Endometrial Carcinoma
This is a multicenter, single-arm, open-label Phase II study to evaluate the activity of GDC-0980 in patients with recurrent or persistent endometrial cancer. The safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of GDC-0980 will also be evaluated.
