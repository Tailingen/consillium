Upfront Systematic Tumour BRCA Testing in Patients With High Grade Serous or Endometrioid Ovarian, Fallopian Tube or Primary Peritoneal Cancer (HGSEC): The t-BRCA Study
A pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of a NGS-based tumour BRCA1/2 mutation testing pathway initiated in the oncology clinic for patients with HGSEC, either at primary diagnosis or first relapse, whereby only patients with a positive germline BRCA1/2 mutation test will be referred to clinical genetics.

Feasibility of an upfront BRCA1/2 mutation testing pathway in HGSEC in terms of clinicians' experience., The primary outcome measure is to assess the feasibility and potential resource impact of the initiation of an ovarian cancer tumour tissue BRCA1/2 mutation testing pathway in the oncology clinic. This will be assessed in terms of clinicians' and patients' experience, impact on patient management and health economic analysis is the primary outcome measure. The primary outcome measure will be assessed via Clinician and patient questionnaires which will evaluate satisfaction/experience with tBRCA testing pathway., 24 months|Feasibility of an upfront BRCA1/2 mutation testing pathway in HGSEC in terms of patients' experience., The feasibility will be assessed via Patient experience questionnaires. The patient experience questionnaires will evaluate patients' understanding of tBRCA testing, satisfaction/experience with tBRCA testing pathway, and feedback on the tBRCA testing pathway., 24 months|The impact on patient management by determining changes in patient treatment (use of a PARP inhibitor or enrolment in BRCA-targeted clinical trials)., A quantifiable outcome measure cannot be added here.

Health benefit will be measured in quality adjusted life years (QALYs). Costs in the model will include genetic counselling, genetic tests, breast cancer screening, risk reducing surgeries (RRS), palliative care and cancer treatment for patients and their first and second-degree relatives. QALYs will be calculated per individual and aggregated to provide an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER)., 24 months
The proportion of germline and somatic BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations among patients with HGSEC in Ireland, Descriptive statistics will be calculated to summarize the number of patients with Germline BRCA1/2 mutations, somatic BRCA1/2 mutations and Variants of Unknown Significance (VUS). Counts, ranges and percentages will be used., 78 months|Patient and disease characteristics (age, stage, degree of surgical cytoreduction, platinum sensitivity) associated with BRCA1/2 mutated HGSEC compared to BRCA1/2 wild type disease., 78 months|Differences in treatment patterns between BRCA1/2 mutated and BRCA1/2 wild type HGSEC by examining number of systemic therapies used., 78 months|Differences in treatment patterns between BRCA1/2 mutated and BRCA1/2 wild type HGSEC by examining use of PARP inhibitor therapy., 78 months|Differences in treatment patterns between BRCA1/2 mutated and BRCA1/2 wild type HGSEC by examining enrolment in clinical trials, 78 months|Identification of clinical outcomes (response platinum free interval (PFI)) associated with BRCA1/2-mutated HGSEC, as compared to BRCA1/2 wild type disease., 78 months|Identification of clinical outcomes (progression free survival (PFS)) associated with BRCA1/2-mutated HGSEC, as compared to BRCA1/2 wild type disease., 78 months|Identification of clinical outcomes (overall survival (OS)) associated with BRCA1/2-mutated HGSEC, as compared to BRCA1/2 wild type disease., 78 months
This pilot study will evaluate the feasibility of a NGS-based tumour BRCA1/2 mutation testing pathway initiated in the oncology clinic for patients with HGSEC, either at primary diagnosis or first relapse, whereby only patients with a positive germline BRCA1/2 mutation test will be referred to clinical genetics. Germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 MLPA will be carried out to ensure accurate detection of BRCA1/2 LGRs. Patients with a high clinical risk of being germline mutation carriers and a negative germline BRCA1/2 mutation test should also be referred to clinical genetics. The investigators believe an upfront tumour testing pathway would be more cost-effective, as it would involve testing all patients for tumour BRCA1/2 mutations, followed by a single site germline test to clarify somatic/germline status of this mutation in approximately 25% of patients. In contrast, an upfront germline testing pathway would involve germline BRCA1/2 testing for all patients, followed by tumour BRCA1/2 tests in those 80 - 82% patients who do not have a germline BRCA1/2 mutation.

Systematic testing of patients in the oncology clinic for tumour BRCA1/2 mutations should not only ensure that all patients who are eligible for and agreeable to testing receive it, but also improve the quality of referrals to the clinical genetics team. Moreover, this approach is likely to significantly improve the identification rate of HGSEC patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutations, with resultant benefits for these patients in terms of cancer treatment and prevention, and their families in terms of opportunities for cancer prevention. The identification of patients with BRCA1/2 mutant HGSEC may facilitate treatment with effective maintenance therapies, or participation in clinical trials targeted at patients with BRCA1/2-mutated HGSEC. The incorporation of a health economics analysis relating to the introduction of this proposed testing pathway will further inform on the feasibility of its adoption into routine clinical practice on study completion. Finally, this study will also report on the currently unknown frequency, characteristics, disease course, and treatment patterns of germline and somatic BRCA1/2 mutations in an Irish population with HGSEC.
