Fluorescence for Sentinel Lymph Node Identification in Cancer Surgery
This is a single-center prospective clinical trial to evaluate non-inferiority of indocyanine green guided sentinel lymph node biopsy compared with the gold standard Technecium99 guided sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with cancers and subjected to surgery.

The diagnostic performance and the tolerance of indocyanine green (ICG) to the radio-isotope (Techniciun99) in the detection of sentinel lymph nodes will be assess using an "Optonuclear" probe (EURORAD S.A.) and QUEST camera

Non-inferiority of indocyanine green guided sentinel lymph node biopsy, The detection rate is defined by the number of patient who at least one sentinel node detected by fluorescence or isotope intra operatively.

Per-operative detection is defined by the identification of at least one sentinel lymph node in the lymphatic drainage area., 1 day
Total number of sentinel lymph node detected, The total number of sentinel node detected will be assess by the two techniques, 1 day|Number of false negative result, False negative result is defined by number of patients with at least one hot metastatic sentinel lymph node without fluorescent metastatic sentinel lymph node, 1 day|Allergic reactions, Percentage of patients with allergic reactions, 8 days|Evaluation of pain, Pain will be assessed by a numerical scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (maximum pain), 1 day|fluorescence imaging, The total number of sentinel node detected by fluorescence imaging, 1 day
