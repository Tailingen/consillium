Circulating Tumor DNA (ctDNA)-Guided Late-Line Treatment in Patients With Late-Stage Breast Cancer
This is a retrospective, observational, multi-center clinical study of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to guide late-line therapy in late-stage metastatic breast cancer patients.

Disease Control Rate (DCR), The total rate of CR+PR+SD after the completion of two cycles of late-line therapy., From the beginning of the treatment to the end of Cycle 2 (each cycle is 28 days) of treatment.|Progression-Free Survival, The survival time between the beginning of treatment to death or the progression., From date of recruitment until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 12 months.
This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of plasma ctDNA mutation in guiding late-line treatment for late-stage metastatic breast cancer patients. Meanwhile, this study tries to evaluate the curative effect of ctDNA subtype-guided late-line therapy.
