Prostate Tissue BioBank
Prostate cancer is also the most common cancer in men with inherited pathogenic variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2. Beyond BRCA1/2, other genes are known to increase the risk of prostate cancer, including ATM, TP53 and HOXB13. We have shown that 5% of men diagnosed with prostate cancer localized to their prostate gland and up to 10-15% of patients with metastatic prostate cancer gland are carriers of an inherited gene mutation.

The Prostate Tissue BioBank is a prospective study which aims to create a biorepository of prostate tissue samples from prostate biopsies and prostatectomies and matched germline DNA from pathogenic mutation carriers in addition to age-matched control samples. Our primary goal is to investigate prostate cancer development and treatment response in carriers of germline DNA repair mutations, as compared to non-carrier controls.
