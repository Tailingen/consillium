Phase II Randomized Trial of mFOLFIRINOX +/- Ramucirumab in Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
This is a phase II, multicenter, double-blinded, randomized, 2-arm trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of mFOLFIRINOX plus ramucirumab (Arm A) vs. mFOLFIRINOX plus placebo (Arm B) in 94 subjects with advanced pancreatic cancer, not amenable to curative treatment. Both arms will continue treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: mFOLFIRINOX|DRUG: Ramucirumab|OTHER: Placebo
Progression Free Survival (PFS) at 9 Month, Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD) \>= 20% increase in tumor burden relative to nadir or the appearance of one or more new lesions; Stable Disease (SD), not meet criteria for CR/PR/PD.

PFS is defined as time of registration until disease progression met by RECIST 1.1 or death from any cause., 9 months
Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival is defined by the date of randomization to date of death from any cause., Up to a maximum of 53 months|Response Rate (RR), Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD) \>= 20% increase in tumor burden relative to nadir or the appearance of one or more new lesions; Stable Disease (SD), not meet criteria for CR/PR/PD.

Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., Up to 44 months|Number of Participants With Adverse Events, Adverse events will be assessed to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4., From date of first dose until 30 days after the last treatment, assessed up to 44 months
OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

EXPERIMENTAL ARM A:

* Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m\^2 over 2-4 hours
* Irinotecan 165 mg/m\^2 over 90 minutes
* 5-FU 2,400 mg/m\^2 as a 46-hour continuous infusion without the 5-FU bolus to decrease the risk of neutropenia.
* Arm A will receive ramucirumab (RAM) administered as an intravenous infusion over 60 minutes (infusion rate should not exceed 25 mg/min), at a fixed dose of 8 mg/kg every 2 weeks.

CONTROL ARM B :

* Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 over 2-4 hours
* Irinotecan 165 mg/m2 over 90 minutes
* 5-FU 2,400 mg/m2 as a 46-hour continuous infusion without the 5-FU bolus to decrease the risk of neutropenia.
* Arm B will receive a placebo infusion every 2 weeks. Due to the double-blinded nature of this study, the volume of placebo will be calculated as if it were RAM.

In order to demonstrate adequate organ function, all screening labs must be obtained within 7 days prior to registration:

Hematological:

* Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL
* Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) ≥ 1,500/mm\^3
* Platelet Count (PLT) ≥ 100,000/mm\^3

Renal:

* Creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL or Creatinine clearance\^1 ≥ 40 mL/min
* Albumin ≥ 2.5 g/dL

Hepatic:

* Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL
* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 3 × ULN or \< 5 xULN in the setting of liver metastases
* Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 3 × ULN or \< 5 xULN in the setting of liver metastases

Coagulation:

* International Normalized Ratio (INR) (Patients receiving warfarin must be switched to low molecular weight heparin and have achieved stable coagulation profile prior to first dose of protocol therapy) ≤1.5 and a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) (PTT/aPTT) \< 1.5 x ULN
