Phase 1, Dose-escalation Trial of OPB-51602 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is an open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation trial in patients with advanced solid tumors. The trial comprises 2 stages: a dose escalation stage at 8 dose levels of 2, 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 mg/day,and possibly additional intermediate doses, to determine the MTD and recommended dose, and a subsequent 2 parts of expansion stage to investigate the safety profile and antitumor effect of OPB-51602 at the recommended dose.

In expansion stage part 1, up to 20 advanced sold tumor subjects will be investigated the safety profiled and antitumor effect of OPB-51602 at the recommended dose for 3 weeks per cycleï¼ˆ2 weeks treatment and 1 week washout). In the expansion stage part 2, a maximum of 20 subjects with Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), Melanoma or Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST) will be treated until an investigational Medicinal product (IMP) efficacious case can be found. subject dosing will be started on Day 1 without 2-day treatment free interval and continued until Day 28 at recommend dose (4mg) first in cycle 1. After safety and tolerability are confirmed, same subjects will be treated at the MTD(5mg) from cycle 2 onwards as a once-daily oral dose for 4 weeks per cycle to obtain additional information about safety, tolerability and antitumor activity of OPB-51602
