A Study of Niraparib as Single Agent in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of Niraparib in Japanese participants with advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: Niraparib
Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), DLT was evaluated as per National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE), v4.03 and defined as any of the following events occurring during Cycle 1 that were considered by investigator to be related with niraparib: Any Grade 5 or 4 hematologic toxicity, except Grade 4 neutropenia less than (\<) 7 days; Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia with fever greater than (\>) 38.5 degree Celsius and/or infection requiring antibiotic/anti-fungal treatment; Any Grade 3, 4,or 5 non-hematologic toxicity except: Grade 3 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea/dehydration occurring in setting of inadequate compliance with supportive care and lasting \<48 hours, Inadequately treated hypersensitivity reactions, Grade 3 acidosis/alkalosis that responded to intervention by improving to less than or equal to (\<=) Grade 2 within 48 hours, Isolated asymptomatic Grade 3 amylase elevation, hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia; Any TEAE leading to an interruption of niraparib for \>14 days., Baseline up to Day 21 in Cycle 1 (Cycle length=21 days)|Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), From the first dose of the study drug up to 28 days after the last dose of the study drug (up to Cycle 22 Day 49) (Cycle length =21 days)|Number of Participants With Grade 3 or Higher TEAEs, TEAEs were graded as per the NCI-CTCAE version 4.03. As per the NCI-CTCAE, Grade 1 (mild, asymptomatic or mild symptoms); Grade 2 (moderate, minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated); Grade 3 (severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening, hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated); Grade 4 (life-threatening consequences, urgent intervention indicated); Grade 5 (death related to adverse event \[AE\])., From the first dose of the study drug up to 28 days after the last dose of the study drug (up to Cycle 22 Day 49) (Cycle length =21 days)|Number of Participants With Serious TEAEs, From the first dose of the study drug up to 28 days after the last dose of the study drug (up to Cycle 22 Day 49) (Cycle length =21 days)|Number of Participants Who Discontinued Study Drug Due to TEAEs, From the first dose of the study drug up to 28 days after the last dose of the study drug (up to Cycle 22 Day 49) (Cycle length =21 days)
Cmax: Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration for Niraparib, Cycle 1 Days 1 and 21: pre-dose and at multiple time points (up to 24 hours) post-dose (Cycle length =21 days)|Tmax: Time to Reach the Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) for Niraparib, Cycle 1 Days 1 and 21: pre-dose and at multiple time points (up to 24 hours) post-dose (Cycle length =21 days)|AUC24ï¼šArea Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve From Time 0 to 24 Hours for Niraparib, Cycle 1 Days 1 and 21: pre-dose and at multiple time points (up to 24 hours) post-dose (Cycle length =21 days)
The drug being tested in this study is called Niraparib. Niraparib is being tested to treat Japanese participants with advanced solid tumors. This study will look at the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of Niraparib administered once daily orally.

The study will enroll approximately 12 participants as a maximum. Participants will be assigned to Cohort 1 (21-day treatment cycle). After that, participants will be assigned to Cohort 2 when safety and tolerability of the 200 mg dose will be demonstrated.

This single-center trial will be conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this study is approximately 16 months. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic with final visit approximately 28 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
