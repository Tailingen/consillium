CD22 Redirected Autologous T Cells for ALL
This is a pilot study to determine the feasibility and safety of a single dose of autologous T cells expressing CD22 chimeric antigen receptors expressing tandem TCR-ζ and 4-1BB signaling domains (CART22/CART22-65s cells) in pediatric and young adult subjects with relapsed or refractory B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

This is a single center, single arm, dual-cohort, open-label pilot study to determine the feasibility and safety of a single dose (administered as split fractions) of autologous T cells expressing CD22 chimeric antigen receptors expressing tandem TCRζ and 4-1BB (TCRζ/4-

1BB) co-stimulatory domains (referred to as "CART22" and "CART22-65s" cells) in pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Cohort assignment will be dependent on the date of consent and confirmation of eligibility by a physician-investigator as follows:

* Cohort 1: was closed to additional recruitment as of Protocol Version 8. All subjects who received CART22 cells will be retrospectively assigned to Cohort 1.
* Cohort 2: was opened as of Protocol Version 8. All subjects assigned to Cohort 2 will receive CART22-65s cells given over 3 days.
* Cohort 3: will open as of Protocol V12, with subjects enrolled sequentially after all infusion slots in Cohort 2 are filled. All subjects assigned to Cohort 3 will also receive CART22-65s cells, however the product will be administered over 2 days.
