Obinutuzumab Containing Conditioning Regimen for Patients With Poor Risk CLL or Richter's Transformation Requiring Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the feasibility, efficacy and safety of an obinutuzumab containing conditioning regimen for poor risk CLL patients and patients with Richter's transformation requiring an allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Richter's Transformation
BIOLOGICAL: Obinutuzumab
PD-free rate, Rate of patients free from disease progression (key efficacy endpoint), 12 months post-transplant
Minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity rate, Minimal residual disease negativity rate at different time points, days +60, +90, +180, +270 and months 12, 18 and 24 post-transplant|Overall response rate (ORR), The overall response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of patients having achieved a CR/CRi, clinical CR/CRi or PR (including PR with lymphocytosis) as best response (according to the IWCLL guidelines (2008)) until and including the response assessment six months after transplantation (=number of patients with best response CR/CRi, clinical CR/CRi or PR (with or without lymphocytosis) divided by the number of the ITT population), 6 months post-transplant|Progression-free survival (PFS), Time from the date of enrolment to the date of first occurrence of progression (determined using standard IWCLL guidelines) or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., up to month 24 post-transplant|Event-free survival (EFS), Time from the date of enrolment to the date of first occurrence of progression (determined using standard IWCLL guidelines), death from any cause or initiation of subsequent treatment, whichever occurs first., up to month 24 post-transplant|Overall survival (OS), Time from the date of enrolment to the date of death due to any cause, up to month 24 post-transplant
CLL is the most common haematological malignancy in the western world. Though in the majority it behaves like a chronic disease with minimal impact on life expectancy, in around 15-20% of the patients it takes a very aggressive course. Patients who experience a high grade transformation, i.e., Richter's transformation also have a poor prognosis. Despite the advent of new therapeutic agents like Bcl-2 and BTK inhibitors which are revolutionising the outlook for this particular patient cohort, allogeneic stem cell transplantation is the only currently available therapy with the potential to cure. The non relapse mortality associated with this treatment is a major deterrent for physicians and patients alike to opt this intervention. We propose a trial to study the use of a B-cell depleting agent, obinutuzumab to simultaneously reduce tumour bulk control and offer GvHD prophylaxis in the peri-transplant setting and thereby analyse its impact on non relapse morbidity and mortality as well as maximum minimum residual disease (MRD) eradication. All patients with poor risk CLL (current EBMT criteria) and Richter's transformation with the best possible response to available therapies will be considered for the trial. Due to the poor disease control associated with peri-transplant T-cell depletion, obinutuzumab will be used instead of T-cell depleting agents as GvHD prophylaxis.
