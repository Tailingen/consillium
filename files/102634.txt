A Phase II Controlled Trial of Velafermin for Prevention of Oral Mucositis
CG53135-05 (velafermin), a recombinant human fibroblast growth factor-20 (rhFGF-20) protein, is under investigation for the prevention of oral mucositis. Oral mucositis is a commonly occurring side effect of high-dose chemotherapy in patients undergoing autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant. The objective of this Phase II trial is to confirm the safety and efficacy of CG53135-05 (velafermin) when administered as a single dose to patients at risk for developing oral mucositis.
