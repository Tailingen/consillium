Atacicept in Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha-naÃ¯ve Subjects With Rheumatoid Arthritis (AUGUST II)
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of atacicept compared to placebo in the treatment of signs and symptoms in a subject population with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX) and no previous exposure to anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFalpha) therapy.

DRUG: Placebo matched to atacicept|DRUG: Atacicept: with loading dose|DRUG: Atacicept|BIOLOGICAL: Adalimumab
Percentage of Participants Achieving American College of Rheumatology 20 Response Based on C-reactive Protein (ACR20-CRP) at Week 26, ACR20-CRP response is defined as greater than or equal to (\>=) 20 percent (%) improvement from Baseline in both tender joint counts (based on a total of 68 joints) and swollen joint counts (based on a total of 66 joints) together with \>=20% improvement from Baseline in at least 3 of the following 5 measures: 1) participant's assessment of pain; 2) participant's global assessment of disease activity; 3) physician's global assessment of disease activity; 4) participant's assessment of physical function; and 5) acute-phase marker (CRP)., Week 26
Percentage of Participants Achieving American College of Rheumatology 50 Response Based on CRP (ACR50-CRP) at Week 26, ACR50-CRP response is defined as \>=50% improvement from Baseline in both tender joint counts (based on a total of 68 joints) and swollen joint counts (based on a total of 66 joints) together with \>=50% improvement from Baseline in at least 3 of the following 5 measures: 1) participant's assessment of pain; 2) participant's global assessment of disease activity; 3) physician's global assessment of disease activity; 4) participant's assessment of physical function; and 5) acute-phase marker (CRP)., Week 26|Percentage of Participants Achieving American College of Rheumatology 70 Response Based on CRP (ACR70-CRP) at Week 26, ACR70-CRP response is defined as \>=70% improvement from Baseline in both tender joint counts (based on a total of 68 joints) and swollen joint counts (based on a total of 66 joints) together with \>=70% improvement from Baseline in at least 3 of the following 5 measures: 1) participant's assessment of pain; 2) participant's global assessment of disease activity; 3) physician's global assessment of disease activity; 4) participant's assessment of physical function; and 5) acute-phase marker (CRP)., Week 26|Percentage of Participants With Good or Moderate European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Responses at Week 26, The EULAR response criteria evaluate change in DAS28 scores represented as "good response", "moderate response", or "no response" considering both the current DAS28 score and the observed improvement from baseline. Participants were considered to have "good" or "moderate" EULAR response if at the time of assessment, their DAS28 score was less than or equal to (\<=) 5.1 and the improvement from baseline in their DAS28 score was greater than (\>) 0.6; or if at the time of assessment, their DAS28 score was \>5.1 and improvement from baseline in their DAS28 score was \>1.2., Week 26|Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Serious TEAEs, An adverse event (AE) was defined as any new untoward medical occurrences/worsening of pre-existing medical condition without regard to possibility of causal relationship. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect., From the first dose of study drug up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug, assessed up to Week 38
