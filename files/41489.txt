Palifermin in Preventing Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease in Patients Who Have Undergone Donor Stem Cell Transplant for Hematologic Cancer
RATIONALE: Growth factors, such as palifermin, may prevent chronic graft-versus-host disease caused by donor stem cell transplant.

PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial studies palifermin in preventing chronic graft-versus-host disease in patients who have undergone donor stem cell transplant for hematologic cancer

BIOLOGICAL: palifermin|OTHER: flow cytometry|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis|OTHER: pharmacological study
Changes in the Number of Recent Thymic Emigrants (RTE) Cluster of Differentiation (CD)4 T Cells in the Blood, RTE CD4 T cells will be defined according to co-expression of CD3, CD4, CD31, CD45RA, and CCR7. Cells will be counted by flow cytometry at baseline and at 4 weeks and changes will be measured as cells per microliter of blood. Positive results indicate an increase in the number of cells between baseline and 4 weeks. Negative results indicate a decrease in the number of cells between baseline and 4 weeks., Baseline and 4 weeks after administration of palifermin
Changes in the Number of Naive CD4 T Cells in the Blood, Naive CD4 T cells will be defined according to co-expression of CD3, CD4, CD45RA, and CCR7. Positive results indicate an increase in the number of cells between baseline and 4 weeks. Negative results indicate a decrease in the number of cells between baseline and 4 weeks., Baseline and 4 weeks after administration of palifermin
OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects of palifermin on thymic function in patients at risk of chronic graft-vs-host disease (GVHD).

II. To evaluate the tolerability of palifermin in patients at risk of chronic GVHD.

OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups based on whether they wish to receive palifermin or not.

GROUP 1: Patients receive palifermin intravenously (IV) on days 1-3 in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

GROUP 2: Patients do not receive palifermin.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up on days 7, 14, 21, and 28.
