Neoadjuvant Combined Endocrine and HER2 Target Therapy in Postmenopausal Women With ER and Her2 Positive Breast Cancer
Cross-talk between epidermal growth factors and the ER occurs at multiple levels and seems to play a crucial role in breast cancer progression and endocrine resistance.Combined HER1/HER2-targeted therapy with aromatase inhibitors for ER-positive and HER-2 positive postmenopausal breast cancer might enhance response and block emergence of endocrine resistant tumor.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Letrozole, Lapatinib
pCR, To evaluate the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate to lapatinib combined with letrozole in neoadjuvant setting, 2010 Nov- 2012 May
SUV for [18F]FES PET, * To evaluate clinical overall response (cORR) rate, disease free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS)
* To assess tolerability and QOL
* To assess MRI response rate
* To identify biological predictors of response to lapatinib combined letrozole treatment
* To determine the correlation of \[18F\]FES PET with biological and imaging predictors of response to the combined modalities
* To evaluate the diagnostic value of SUV for \[18F\]FES PET in the prediction of pathologic, clinical response to neoadjuvant HER2 target- and endocrine therapy, 2010 Nov- 2012 May
1. To evaluate the efficacy of the neoadjuvant combination therapy with letrozole and lapatinib in postmenopausal patients with ER-positive and HER2-positive breast cancer.
2. To assess markers predictive of treatment response and outcome in this setting.
