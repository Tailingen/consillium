Study of CM-24 (MK-6018) Alone and In Combination With Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in Participants With Selected Advanced or Recurrent Malignancies (MK-6018-001)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of humanized IgG4 (kappa) isotype monoclonal antibody against CEACAM1 (CM-24 \[MK-6018\]), administered intravenously as monotherapy and in combination with Pembrolizumab (MK-3475), in participants with selected advanced or recurrent malignancies. Escalating multiple doses will be evaluated to determine the recommended dose for Phase 2 clinical studies.
