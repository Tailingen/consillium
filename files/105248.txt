Dose-Escalation Study of ABBV-838, an Antibody Drug Conjugate, in Subjects With Relapsed and Refractory Multiple Myeloma
This is a Phase 1/1b, open-label, dose-escalation study designed to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose of ABBV-838 in subjects with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: ABBV-838|DRUG: Pomalidomide|DRUG: Dexamethasone
Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of ABBV-838, The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax: measured in ng/ml) is the highest concentration that a drug achieves in the blood after the first dose, but before administration of a second dose., Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1) and C3D1 pre- and post-dose; C1D4, C1D8, C1D15, C2D1, C2D15, C3D4, C3D8, C3D15, C4D1, and all subsequent ABBV-838 pre-dose dosing cycles|Maximum tolerated dose of ABBV-838, The highest dose level at which less than 2 of 6 subjects or less than 33% of (if cohort is expanded beyond 6) subjects experience a dose limiting toxicity., Up to 2 years from first dose of study
Preliminary activity of ABBV-838 monotherapy, Response evaluation will be based on International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Response Criteria., At screening, Cycle 1 Day 15 (C1D15), C3D15, C4D1, and for subjects who have been on ABBV-838 for â‰¥ 6 cycles, radiologic tumor assessments may be performed every 3 cycles per Investigator discretion up to approximately 3 years
This is a Phase 1/1b, open-label, dose-escalation study designed to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose of ABBV-838 in subjects with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.
