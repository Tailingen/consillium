Study to Evaluate Safety and Clinical Activity of AB122 in Biomarker Selected Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1b open-label study to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of zimberelimab (AB122) in biomarker-selected participants with advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: zimberelimab
Objective response Rate (ORR), Based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 Tumor assessments over time will be measured using RECIST v1.1, Approximately 12 months
Number of Participants with Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) as Assessed by CTCAE v5.0, Number of Participants Treated with zimberelimab with Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) as Assessed by CTCAE v5.0, From screening until 90 days after the last dose of investigational product or until initiation of a new systemic anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first, approximately 12 months|Duration of response (DoR), The time from first documentation of disease response (CR or PR) until first documentation of progressive disease., From the date of initiation of treatment until the date of first documented progression, through completion of the study, approximately 12 months|Time to response (TTR), The time from treatment initiation to confirmed best overall response of CR or PR., From the date of initiation of treatment until the date of first documented response, through completion of the study, approximately 12 months|Disease control rate at 6 months (DCR6), Number of Participants with Complete Response, Partial Response, or Stable Disease for Greater Than 6 Months per RECIST v1.1, 6 Months|Progression-free survival at 6 (PFS6), The percentage of Participants Without Disease Progression per RECIST v1.1 and iRECIST at 6 months, 6 Months|Progression-free survival at 12 months (PFS12), The percentage of Participants Without Disease Progression per RECIST v1.1 and iRECIST at 12 months, 12 Months|Overall survival at 12 months (OS12), The percentage of participants who are alive at 12 months based on first dose to date of death., 12 Months
The activity of zimberelimab every 3 weeks (Q3W) will be evaluated in molecularly defined patient populations as described by the StrataNGS test (to be performed outside of this study protocol). Participants with any advanced tumor type will be stratified evenly by tumor biomarker status as follows: TMB-H or Strata Immune Signature positive. Each cohort may enroll approximately 40 participants. Following completion of and/or discontinuation from investigational product and follow-up, all participants will be followed for survival.
