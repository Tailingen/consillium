Effectiveness of Acupuncture for Breast Cancer Related Lymphedema
This multicenter placebo-controlled trial focuses on the efficacy and safety of acupuncture on breast-cancer related lymphedema. 200 participants will be recruited, and randomized in two groups: the real acupuncture group and the sham acupuncture group.

Absolute Reduced Limb Volume Ratio, Data of the absolute limb volume will be collected before the treatment (volume at baseline, B) and after the treatment (volume after therapy, A) for every participant. VL is the volume of the affected arm with lymphedema, and VC is the volume of the contralateral arm. Then, The ARLVR will be calculated using the following formula: ARLVR (%) = (VL-Vc)B-( VL-Vc)A/( VL-Vc)B Ã—100%.

The arm measurement will be conducted using perometer. This method is inspired by the method established by Anderson et al., Day 0 (baseline), Day 30(endpoint)
Incidence of Adverse Event, Every adverse event during the treatment will be recorded, unless it is confirmed otherwise, whereas those occurs after the treatment will not be calculate unless it is confirmed., Day 0 (baseline), Day 30(endpoint)
In the theory of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Breast Cancer Related Lymphedema (BCRL) is classified as "edema", and is considered to be caused by qi (chi) deficiency and blood stagnation. Acupuncture, as an ancient therapy in TCM, is thought to have the efficacy to stimulate the transformation of qi and drainage of dampness, and is widely used for various diseases including edema in China. Early clinical trials as well as our own clinical observation have demonstrated that acupuncture can ameliorate limb swelling and decrease lymphedema. However, no randomized placebo-controlled trial has been performed to evaluate this efficacy of acupuncture. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the safety and potential efficacy of acupuncture to treat chronic upper-limb lymphedema.
