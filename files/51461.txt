Clinical Research Platform on Decision Making and Clinical Impact of Biomarker-Driven Precision Oncology
The retrospective cohort study INFINITY will be an instrument to analyze the current practice of precision oncology in the real-world setting. It will provide insight into real-world biomarker-directed treatment of cancer patients not eligible for standard therapies. The study will retrospectively collect medical records' data of patients who received a targeted treatment based on a potentially actionable alteration or biomarker identified by molecular diagnostics. Data of deceased patients will be included. The study will analyze how molecular test results guided clinical decision making. The compiled treatment and outcome data will be a valuable resource to analyze the use and effectiveness of targeted therapy approaches in biomarker-defined and entity-defined subpopulations of cancer patients. These signals might generate new insights and foster progress of targeted cancer treatment. The associated biomarker profiling module aims to set up a decentral biobank for future research on molecular alterations or central re-testing.
