Epirubicin or Not in Patients With TOP2A (Topoisomerase (DNA) II Alpha (170kD)) Normal Early Breast Cancer
The Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group (DBCG) wishes to clarify if recurrence-free and overall life expectancy is longer after docetaxel and cyclophosphamide compared to epirubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel in patients with TOP2A normal and operable breast cancer.
Breast Neoplasms
DRUG: Epirubicin, cyclophosphamide and docetaxel|DRUG: docetaxel, cyclophosphamide
IDFS; invasive disease-free survival, Within 10-yeras
Overall survival, Life-long observation|DDFS; distant disease-free survival, Within 10-years|Serious adverse events, Within 10-years
In DBCG trial 89D we in more than 1,200 patients showed that substitution in CMF chemotherapy of methotrexate with epirubicin improves survival for patients with primary and operable breast cancer. In a retrospective evaluation we have also shown that approximately 20% of all patients in 89D have tumors with numerical changes of the TOP2A gene, and that only patients with abnormal TOP2A benefit from epirubicin. In the current trial the DBCG wishes to clarify if recurrence-free and overall life expectancy is longer after docetaxel and cyclophosphamide compared to epirubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel in patients with TOP2A normal and operable breast cancer.
