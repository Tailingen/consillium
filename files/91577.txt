A Phase 1 Study Evaluating CPI-0610 in Patients With Progressive Lymphoma
First in human, open-label, sequential dose escalation and expansion study of CPI-0610 in patients with progressive lymphoma. CPI-0610 is a small molecule inhibitor of bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) proteins.
Lymphoma
DRUG: CPI-0610
Frequency of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) associated with CPI-0610 administration during the first cycle (first 21 days) of treatment, DLTs asessed during Cycle 1 (first 21 days on study)
Safety and tolerability of CPI-0610 as assessed by: frequency of adverse events and serious adverse events; changes in hematology and clinical chemistry values; changes in physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram, ECHO and ECOG score, Assessed from Day 1 of Cycle 1 through 30 days after patient's last dose of study drug|Pharmacokinetic parameters of CPI-0610: AUC(0-t), AUC(0-inf), AUCtau,ss, Tmax, Cmax, Ctrough, T1/2, Vd/F, CL/F, Assessed during cycle 1 (first 21 days on study); and on cycle 2, day 1|Pharmacodynamic effects of CPI-0610: Changes in the expression of MYC and other genes in tumor tissue; changes in cellular proliferation and in the extent of apoptosis; changes in tumor metabolism, Assessed during cycle 1 (first 21 days on study); and on cycle 2, day 1|Changes in the expression of a set of genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) that are sensitive to BET inhibition, Assessed during cycle 1 (first 21 days on study)|Anti-lymphoma activity associated with CPI-0610 treatment, After every 2 cycles of treatment for the first 6 cycles, and after every 4 cycles thereafter; assessed up to approximately 12 months
