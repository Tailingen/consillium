A Randomized Study of Epigenetic Priming Using Decitabine With Front Line Induction Chemotherapy Compared With Immediate Induction Chemotherapy in Pediatric Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) Subjects
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of decitabine when used before chemotherapy to treat leukemia in pediatric patients. The study will also evaluate the ways decitabine is affected or changed when used in the human body.
Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML)
DRUG: decitabine Induction Chemotherapy|DRUG: Induction Chemotherapy
Primary Endpoint (Core Component): Complete Remission (CR) Rate as defined by International Working Group - 2003 criteria, ~ 2 years
Secondary Endpoint (Core Component): Methylation of DNA following decitabine therapy., Until Week 3 after chemotherapy|Secondary Endpoint (Core Component): Time to platelet recovery (≥ 100,000/mm3) and time to neutrophil recovery (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] ≥ 1000/mm3) following induction chemotherapy, Until ~ 4 weeks after last dose of induction chemotherapy
