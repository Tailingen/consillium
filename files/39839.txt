Safety and Efficacy of Marqibo in Relapsed Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
This was a Phase 2, international, multicenter, open-label, single-arm trial evaluating Marqibo (VSLI) in adult subjects with: 1) Ph- ALL or lymphoblastic lymphoma in second or greater relapse; or 2) Ph- ALL or lymphoblastic lymphoma who failed 2 or greater treatment lines of anti-leukemia chemotherapy. The original enrollment target for this study was approximately 56 subjects. Per a protocol amendment, enrollment was increased from 56 to 65.

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate:

- The efficacy of the study treatment as determined by the rate of CR plus CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) in adult subjects with Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) ALL in second relapse or adult subjects with (Ph-) ALL who failed 2 treatment lines of anti-leukemia chemotherapy. Subjects must have achieved a CR to at least 1 prior anti-leukemia therapy as defined by a leukemia-free interval of ≥ 90 days.
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)
DRUG: Marqibo® (vincristine sulfate liposomes injection)
Complete Remission Plus Complete Remission Without Full Platelet Recovery (CR + CRi), CR is defined as no evidence of ALL: ANC\>or=1x10\^9/L or platelet count\>100x10\^9/L, absence of leukemia blast cells in blood and marrow (\<5% blasts), resolution of all sites of extramedullary disease (EMD). CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi): As per CR but platelet count\< 100x10\^9/L or ANC\< 1x10\^9/L. Partial remission(PR):CR with\>5-25% abnormal cells in the marrow or 50% decrease in bone marrow blasts. Reduction in EMD by at least 50%. Hematologic Improvement. Bone marrow blast(BMB) response: BMB\<5% in the absence of HI. Stable disease(SD):No significant hematological and extramedullary change from baseline., Response assessment performed at the end of each 28 day course.|Clinical Response Assessment Per Independent Response Review Committee (IRRC) Evaluation, Number of subjects who achieved Complete Remission (CR)as assessed by the IRRC. CR is defined as no evidence of ALL. ANC\>=1X10\^9/L or Platelet count\>=100x10\^9/L, absence of blasts in blood and morrow (\<5%), resolution of all sites of extramedullary disease (EMD). CR with incomplete blood count recovery(CRi)is defined as per CR but platelet count \<100x10\^9/L or ANC\<1x10\^9/L., Response assessment at the end of each 28 days course
Duration of CR + CRi, Duration of response for those subjects who achieved CR or CRi, CR + CRi duration was calculated from the date the subject first met the definition of CR or CRi until the date of relapse|Overall Survival, Time, in days, from informed consent date until the date of death or date of last contact, unlimited
The secondary objectives of this study were to evaluate:

* Duration of CR plus CRi
* Overall survival
* Safety and tolerability
