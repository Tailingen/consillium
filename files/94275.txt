A Clinical Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetic Characteristics of HLX26 Monoclonal Antibody Injection in Patients With Solid Tumor or Lymphoma
This study is a first-in-class open-label phase I human clinical study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of HLX26 with escalated doses in the treatment of patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumors or lymphomas.
Solid Tumor, Adult|Lymphoma
DRUG: HLX26
The Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) of HLX26 within 3 weeks after the first Administration in patients with Advanced/Metastatic Solid Tumors or Lymphomas, DLT, from day1 to day 21|The Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of HLX26 within 3 weeks after the first Administration in patients with Advanced/Metastatic Solid, MTD, from day1 to day 21
This study is a first-in-class open-label phase I human clinical study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of HLX26 with escalated doses in the treatment of patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumors or lymphomas. In this study, accelerated titration is combined with a 3 + 3 dose escalation method, and the patients will be given different doses(60mg, 150mg, 300mg, 500mg, 800mg Q3W) of HLX26 intravenously. Observation period of DLT lasts for 3 weeks after the first administration of HLX26.
