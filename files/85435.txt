Phase II Study of Immunomaintenance Using POmalidomide With Elotuzumab afteR Second Autologous Transplant
The purpose of this clinical trial is to examine the role of an immune modulatory drug (IMID) in combination with elotuzumab, in a lenalidomide-free approach to maintenance therapy following second unplanned autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT) for relapsed multiple myeloma.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Elotuzumab|DRUG: Pomalidomide
Progression-Free Survival, To estimate progression-free survival (PFS) rate in patients receiving the combination of elotuzumab and pomalidomide who have undergone a second unplanned autologous PBSCT for relapsed multiple myeloma (MM)., From enrollment until the time of disease progression, up to 36 months
Overall Survival, To estimate overall survival (OS) rate in patients receiving the combination of elotuzumab and pomalidomide who have undergone a second unplanned autologous PBSCT for relapsed MM., From enrollment until the time of death, up to 36 months|Summary of >= Grade 3 Hematologic and Non-Hematologic Toxicities, The number and frequency of toxicities will be summarized by type and severity in tabular format. The rates of grade â‰¥3 hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities will be reported along with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) which will be constructed using the Wilson score method., From enrollment until treatment discontinuation, up to 18 months
