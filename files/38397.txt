Efficacy and Safety in Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) Treated With Idelalisib and Rituximab in the Clinical Practice: a GIMEMA-ERIC Study
The present study aims at obtaining more in-depth information on how patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia treated with idelalisib and rituximab react to treatment.

This cohort study will recruit patients with treatment-na√Øve chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with TP53 disruption (i.e. 17p- or TP53 mutations) or relapsed/refractory CLL who were treated with idelalisib and rituximab between 01/07/2014 and 31/05/2017 at European centres adhering to the GIMEMA group and the ERIC group.
