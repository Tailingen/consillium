Treatment of Adults Aged Up to 60 Years With De Novo Acute Myeloblastic Leukaemia,Secondary AML, or RAEB-T
This randomized phase II/III trial investigates the antileukemic activity and toxicity of the FLAG-Ida regimen as a second induction course in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia and bad response to the first induction cycle and/or with a high risk karyotype and compares the antileukemic activity and toxicity of high dose cytarabine/daunorubicin vs. autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation as late consolidation therapy in standard risk patients.
