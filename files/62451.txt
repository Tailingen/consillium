Multifunctional Magnetic Resonance (MR) for Radiotherapy Planning in Prostate Cancer
To determine if functional MRI methods will aid planning of a radiation dose boost within the prostate in patients with prostate cancer potentially improving safety and efficacy.

Comparison of dose distributions produced by rival radiotherapy plans judged using radiobiological model predictions of Tumour Control Probability (TCP) and Normal Tissue Complication Probability (NTCP).
Comparison of reproducibility of registration algorithms for mapping functional MR data acquired before hormone therapy to MR anatomical data acquired after hormone therapy and prior to radiotherapy.|Comparison of reproducibility of registration of functional and MR data with computed tomography (CT) data using gold seed registration, assessing reproducibility and positioning issues.|Comparison of image quality, registration reproducibility and gland distortion of internal and external imaging coils for MRI image acquisition and registration of the prostate.|Comparison of dose distributions produced by rival radiotherapy plans judged using three standard dose-volume constraints for targets and normal tissues and careful examination of the 3D dose distribution.
