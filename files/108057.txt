18-fluorofuranylnorprogesterone (FFNP) PET/MRI as a Potential Biomarker of Response to Progesterone Therapy
Purpose: The purpose of this study is to evaluate FFNP PET/MRI's utility for predicting response to Levonorgestrel-releasing Intrauterine Device (LR-IUD) hormonal therapy for Complex Atypical hyperplasia (CAH) and Endometrial Cancer (EC).

Participants: Eight women with histologically confirmed CAH or Grade 1 EC who have planned treatment with LR-IUD will be recruited..

Procedures (methods): The is a prospective, single arm, pilot study of 8 participants who will receive one FFNP PET/MRI scan. Medical records will be followed for 6 months.

DRUG: 18F-fluorofuranylnorprogesterone PET / MRI
Sensitivity of 18F-fluorofuranylnorprogesterone (FFNP) PET/MRI for predicting response to progestin therapy in CAH /EC patients, The sensitivity of FFNP PET /MR is defined as the ability of readers (radiologists) to correctly detect areas that will respond to treatment, as determined by histopathologic evaluation., Upon completion of all study image data collection for all participants [approximately 1 year]|Specificity of 18F-fluorofuranylnorprogesterone (FFNP) PET/MRI for predicting response to progestin therapy in CAH /EC patients, The specificity is similarly defined as the ability of readers to determine areas that will fail to respond to treatment, as determined by histopathologic evaluation., Upon completion of all study image data collection for all participants [approximately 1 year]
Correlate FFNP Mean Standardized Uptake Value (SUVmean) at baseline and on repeat examination with estrogen and progesterone receptor expression in the CAH/EC tissues at baseline and after 6 months of treatment., The association between SUVmean and tumor volume and the degree of estrogen/progesterone receptor will be evaluated using random coefficient trajectory models, separately for each outcome. These models allow a separate outcome trajectory for each patient, accounting for within-patient correlations arising from the fact that measurements are taken at multiple timepoints. Estrogen/progesterone receptor will be included as a fixed effect, along with the interaction of this fixed effect and time. A p-value \<0.05 for this interaction will be considered evidence that the association between the outcome and estrogen/progesterone receptor varies by time. A patient-level random intercept will be included in the models. Differences in predicted means of the outcomes at each time point will be computed and tested to see if they differ from 0; p-values \<0.05 for these tests will be considered evidence of a difference in predicted means by estrogen/progesterone values., Upon completion of all study image data collection for all participants [approximately 1 year]|Correlate FFNP Maximum Standardized Uptake Value (SUVmax) at baseline and on repeat examination with estrogen and progesterone receptor expression in the CAH/EC tissues at baseline and after 6 months of treatment., The association between SUVmax and tumor volume and the degree of estrogen/progesterone receptor will be evaluated using random coefficient trajectory models, separately for each outcome. These models allow a separate outcome trajectory for each patient, accounting for within-patient correlations arising from the fact that measurements are taken at multiple timepoints.
