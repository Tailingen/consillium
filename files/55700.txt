A Study of Picoplatin and Docetaxel in Subjects With Prostate Cancer
This study will review the safety of picoplatin, a new type of platinum drug, with docetaxel, a drug commonly used in the treatment of prostate cancer. Patients who are eligible for this study will have had a diagnosis of hormone-refractory prostate cancer that has metastasized to other areas of the body, and have not been previously treated with chemotherapy drugs. Picoplatin will be administered in combination with docetaxel and prednisone to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Patients will receive IV treatments of picoplatin with docetaxel every 3 weeks, with prednisone, 5 mg orally, twice daily.
