Real World Experience With Mogamulizumab in the Treatment of Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma
This study is designed to describe the clinical activity and safety profile of mogamulizumab at standard dose in the treatment of CTCL patients in real world setting
Cutaneous T Cell Lymphoma|Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma/Mycosis Fungoides|Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma/Sezary Syndrome
To assess Overall response rate lasting at least 4 months (ORR4), Overall response lasting at least 4 months from response (CR+PR) to treatment with mogamulizumab, The endpoint will be evaluated from the beginning to the end of the study (up to 18 months)
To assess Frequencies of baseline characteristic compared with the expected from MAVORIC study, To identify whether real life patients show baseline characteristics (i.e., CTCL subtype, cutaneous and blood involvement, staging) in line with the population enrolled in the MAVORIC trial, The endpoint will be evaluated from the beginning to the end of the study (up to 18 months)|To assess Overall response rate (ORR) at 1 month, ORR at 4 months and best ORR obtained from beginning of treatment with Mogamulizumab, Evaluate the early and late activity of mogamulizumab, The endpoint will be evaluated from the beginning to the end of the study (up to 18 months)|To assess Logistic regression of ORR4 with peripheral blood involvement score, To identify whether the presence of a B1 B2 score is associated with a higher response rate in the skin, compared to B0, The endpoint will be evaluated from the beginning to the end of the study (up to 18 months)|To assess Frequencies of adverse events collected with the clinical course, To investigate whether the presence of a cutaneous side effect is associated with a different clinical course and high response rate, The endpoint will be evaluated from the beginning to the end of the study (up to 18 months)|To assess Progression Free Survival (PFS), Overall Survival (OS), Time to Next Treatment (TTNT), To investigate the overall efficacy of treatment. Time to event functions will be stratified according to the disease subtype (Mycosis fungoides/SÃ©zary syndrome), stage (early vs advanced), number of previous treatment lines (1 or more than), The endpoint will be evaluated from the beginning to the end of the study (up to 18 months)|To assess Frequencies of patients who receive mogamulizumab as bridge to allotransplant, as well as disease features of these patients and type of response to transplant, To evaluate the number and related disease features of patients who receive mogamulizumab as bridge to allotransplant, as well as the type of response to transplant in these patients, The endpoint will be evaluated from the beginning to the end of the study (up to 18 months)
Mogamulizumab (anti-CCR4) has been recently approved and reimbursed in Italy for the treatment of Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) after 1 previous systemic treatment based on the favourable results of the MAVORIC clinical trial. To date, no real-world data on significant series of patients treated routinely with mogamulizumab in clinical practice are available. As real-life data are essential to confirm the preliminary evidence displayed in phase III trials, this study aims at describing the clinical activity and safety profile of mogamulizumab at standard dose in the treatment of CTCL patients in real world settings.
