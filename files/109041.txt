Efficacy and Safety of MW032 and Xgeva® in Subjects With Bone Metastases From Solid Tumors
A multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel controlled Phase III clinical study to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of MW032 and Xgeva® in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors.
Bone Metastases
DRUG: MW032|DRUG: Xgeva
uNTx/uCr, Compare MW032 and Xgeva® for percentage change in bone conversion index (BTM) - urinary type I collagen cross-linked peptide (uNTx) adjusted for urinary creatinine (uCr) in Chinese subjects with solid tumor bone metastasis (uNTx/uCr from baseline to week 13), from baseline to week 13
uNTx/uCr, Compare the percentage change in MW032 and Xgeva® for bone conversion indicator uNTx/uCr among subjects with solid tumor metastasis (from baseline to weeks 5,25,37 and 53)., from baseline to weeks 5,25,37 and 53|S-BALP, Compare the changes of bone specific alkaline phosphatase (S-BALP) from baseline to weeks 5,13, 25,37 and 53., from baseline to weeks 5,13,25,37 and 53|SRE, SRE occurrence, from baseline to week 53
This is A multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel controlled Phase III clinical trial.

The primary objective is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of MW032 and Xgeva® in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors.

The secondary objective are to evaluate the clinical safety and immunogenicity of MW032 and Xgeva® in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors.
