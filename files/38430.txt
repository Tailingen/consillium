2nd-line Therapy With Nal-IRI After Gem/Nab-pac in Advanced Pancreatic Cancer - Predictive Role of 1st-line Therapy
Second-line therapy with Nal-IRI after failure gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel in advanced pancreatic cancer - predictive role of 1st-line therapy
Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer|Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: Irinotecan Liposomal Injection [Onivyde]
Time to Treatment Failure of second-line treatment (TTF2), Time-To-Treatment-Failure - (TTF2) is defined as date of signed ICF until permanent treatment discontinuation (or day of initially planned next cycle) due to progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity.

Expected increase of the TTF2 by 50% in the cohort of patients with favorable TTF1 (TTF1 high: upper third of the patient population) as compared to patients with short TTF1 (TTF low: lowest third of the patient population), up to 6 month
Overall survival (OS), Survival will be calculated from the date ICF signature until the date of death from any cause. If no event is observed (e.g. lost to follow-up) OS is censored at the day of last subject contact., up to 12 month|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the number of months from the date of first dose of 2nd-line treatment to the date of death or investigator assessed progression (by any imaging techique), whichever occurred earlier. If neither death nor progression is observed during the study, PFS data will be censored at the last valid tumor assessment., up to 12 month|AEs / SAEs, The Safety Population is the primary population for the evaluation of treatment administration/compliance and all safety data and will comprise all patients enrolled who received at least one dose of study medication. Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment actually received., up to 12 month|Quality of Life (QoL) EORTC QLQ-C30, Helath related Quality of Life will be evaluated with:

- EORTC QLQ-C30, up to 6 month|Quality of Life (QoL) EORTC QLQ-PAN26, Helath related Quality of Life will be evaluated with:

- EORTC QLQ-PAN26, up to 6 month|Quality of Life (QoL) EORTC EQ-5D-5L, Helath related Quality of Life will be evaluated with:

- EORTC EQ-5D-5L, up to 6 month|Evaluation of time to definitive deterioration of QoL (TDD), Time to QoL deterioration is defined as a loss of â‰¥ 10 points in the EORTC QLQ-C30 compared to base-line., from date of baseline Scrore until date QoL Score deterioration, assessed up to 12 month|Growth modulation index (GMI), The ratio of time to progression with the nth-line (TTP(n)) of therapy to the TTP(n-1) with the n-1th-line. GMI \>1.33 is considered as a sign of activity in phase II trials., up to 6 month
Research hypothesis:

Patients profit from 2nd-line therapy with Nal-IRI if they also had a benefit from 1st-line treatment. Benefit from treatment (either 1st or 2nd-line) will be defined as a patient specific Time-To-Treatment Failure (TTF) which is in the upper third of the distribution of TTF values of the studied population.
