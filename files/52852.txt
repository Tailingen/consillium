AK112 in Combination With Chemotherapy in Advanced Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This trial is a Phase III study. All patients are stage IIIB/C (unsuitable for radical therapy) or stage IV squamous non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AK112 combined with chemotherapy versus Tislelizumab combined with chemotherapy in patients with advanced squamous NSCLC.
