A Global Study to Assess the Effects of MEDI4736 (Durvalumab) in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
A study to assess the Effects of MEDI4736 (Durvalumab) in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer in terms of efficacy, safety and tolerability
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: MEDI4736
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Patients commenced treatment with durvalumab on Day 1 and continued on a Q2W schedule for a maximum of 12 months. Tumor assessments using computed tomography / magnetic resonance imaging were performed every 8 weeks. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) measurements as given by the Independent Central Review (ICR) were used to derive the primary variable of ORR ., Responses recorded during initial 12 month treatment period (up to primary analysis DCO)
Time to Response (TTR), TTR (per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by the ICR) is defined as the time from the date of first dose until the date of first documented response (which is subsequently confirmed). TTR was only analyzed for Cohort 2., Responses recorded during initial 12 month treatment period (up to primary analysis DCO)|Duration of Response (DoR), DoR (per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by the ICR) was defined as the time from the date of first documented response (which was subsequently confirmed) until the first date of documented progression or death in the absence of disease progression (ie, date of PFS event or censoring - date of first response + 1). DoR was only analyzed for Cohort 2. Cohort 2: Median DoR was 12.3 months in the PD-L1 high (TC\>=25%) group at DCO (Q3 was NR). Of the 7 evaluable patients, the median DoR was not reached in the PD-L1 low/neg group (TC \<25%); therefore the DoR "number of participants analyzed" field has been entered as "0" and the DoR results field has been left blank., Time from response to progression, death, or last assessment (up to approximately 2 years 3 months for the primary analysis DCO)|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from the date of first dose until death due to any cause (ie, date of death or censoring - date of first dose + 1). Results are reported as median OS, calculated using the Kaplan-Meier methodology., From date of first treatment until final DCO (up to approximately 3 years 8 months)
This study is designed to investigate the efficacy, safety, tolerability of a new drug, MEDI4736 (Durvalumab), in patients with Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer. MEDI4736 will be investigated in patients who have received at least two prior treatment regimens including one platinum-based chemotherapy
