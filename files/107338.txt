Number of Subjects With Dose-limiting Toxicities, Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is any grade 3 or 4 new non-hematologic toxicity occurring during Cycle 1 requiring a dose delay of \>14 days from the planned Day 1 of Cycle 2 (21 days from Day 1 of Cycle 1). The initial planned dose of brentuximab vedotin for the Phase I cohort of 6 patients is 1.8 mg/kg. This cohort will be evaluated for DLT in the first cycle of treatment. Dose de-escalation to 1.2 mg/kg will occur if â‰¥ 2 of 6 patients at the 1.8 mg/kg dose level experience a DLT., 21 days (Cycle 1)|Overall Response Rate (ORR), Overall response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of patients with CR or PR according to the International Working Group Response Criteria for non-Hodgkin Lymphoma at the conclusion of systemic therapy., Three to five weeks after the completion of Cycle 6 (approximately 5 months after start if treatment)
