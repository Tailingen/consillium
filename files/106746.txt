A Phase 3 Study of Pembrolizumab + Epacadostat or Placebo in Subjects With Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma (Keynote-252 / ECHO-301)
The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability when combining pembrolizumab with epacadostat or placebo in participants with unresectable or metastatic melanoma
Melanoma
DRUG: pembrolizumab + epacadostat|DRUG: pembrolizumab + placebo
Progression-free Survival, Progression-free survival, defined as the time from date of randomization until the earliest date of disease progression, as determined by independent central review of objective radiographic disease assessments per RECIST 1.1, or death from any cause, whichever comes first., Assessed every 9 weeks for duration of study participation which is estimated to be 24 months|Overall Survival (OS) Rate at 6 Months, Defined as time from date of randomization to date of death due to any cause. OS was calculated using product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) method for censored data., Assessed every 9 weeks of study participation which is estimated to be 24 months. The OS rate at Month 6 was calculated.
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the percentage of the participants in the analysis population who have a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on RECIST 1.1 by independent central review., Assessed every 9 weeks for duration of study participation which is estimated to be 24 months|Safety and Tolerability, as Assessed by Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events, Safety and tolerability, as assessed by percentage of participants with adverse events and changes in laboratory parameters., Through up to 90 days after end of treatment, up to 27 months|Duration of Response (DOR), Defined as the time from the earliest date of qualifying response until earliest date of disease progression, per RECIST v1.1, or death from any cause, whichever comes first. Includes participants with complete response or partial response., Assessed every 9 weeks for duration of study participation which is estimated to be 24 months|Apparent Oral Clearance (CL/F) of Epacadostat, Defined as oral dose clearance., Through up to 30 days after the end of treatment, up to 25 months|Apparent Volume of Distribution (Vd/F) of Epacadostat, Apparent volume of distribution after administration., Through up to 30 days after the end of treatment, up to 25 months|Clearance (CL) of Pembrolizumab, Through up to 30 days after the end of treatment, up to 25 months|Volume of Distribution (V) of Pembrolizumab, Through up to 30 days after the end of treatment, up to 25 months|Formation of Anti-pembrolizumab Antibodies, Evaluate the measurement of anti-drug antibodies (ADA)., Through up to 30 days after the end of treatment, up to 25 months
