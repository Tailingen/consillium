A Mobile Application to Improve Postoperative Outcomes in Colorectal Cancer
The unplanned readmission rate after colorectal cancer surgery is still high, despite the implementation of enhanced recovery programs. The use of a mobile-based application for perioperative remote monitoring may improve the postoperative outcomes and reduce the unplanned postoperative readmissions.

Despite the implementation of enhanced recovery programs, the rate of unplanned readmissions remains high after colorectal cancer surgery. These readmissions are often preventable with a better postoperative management. Increasing studies have demonstrated the feasibility and efficacy of perioperative remote monitoring mobile applications in improving the postoperative outcomes but are often limited to one restricted outcome. This project aims to evaluate the effect of the Care 4 Today® (Johnson \& Johnson) perioperative mobile app on the postoperative outcomes of colorectal cancer patients, with a focus on unplanned readmissions.
