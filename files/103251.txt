BCMA CAR-T Versus ASCT in Transplant-eligible Patients With Multiple Myeloma
This is a prospective, non-inferiority study comparing VRD±D followed by BCMA CAR-T cell therapy versus VRD±D followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients.
Multiple Myeloma
BIOLOGICAL: anti-BCMA CAR-T|BIOLOGICAL: ASCT
Persistent MRD-negative rate, achieving MRD-negative, as determined by NGS/NGF, Up to 2 year|Progression free survival (PFS), Progression free survival is defined as the time from the date of diagnosis to the date of first documented PD, as defined in the IMWG criteria, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, Up to 5 year
Complete response rate (CRR), CR or better is defined as percentage of participants who achieve a CR response or Stringent Complete Response (sCR) response accoording to the IMWG criteria, within 1 week after induction therapy, 1 month after the CAR-T cell infusion or ASCT, within 1 week after consolidation therapy|Duration of Remission(DOR), Duration from the first evaluation of at least partial remission (PR) to the onset of disease progression or death due to disease progression (whichever occurs first), Up to 5 year|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival is measured from the date of diagnosis to the date of the participant's death., Up to 5 year
