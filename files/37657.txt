Efficacy of Gamma Camera Used Intraoperatively for ID of Sentinel Lymph Nodes w/ Lymphoscintigraphy
This study evaluates the ability of a prototype intraoperative handheld gamma camera (pIHGC) to image (detect) sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in melanoma and breast cancer during surgical excision, as compared to standard of care intraoperative gamma probes (GP). The unit of study in this trial was SNLs rather individual participants. Each device was assessed for relative node detection sensitivity (S) of those SLNs.

DEVICE: Prototype intraoperative handheld gamma camera (pIHGC)|DEVICE: Lymphoscintigraphy with intraoperative gamma probes (GP)|RADIATION: radioactive Tc99M
Relative Node Detection Sensitivity, Relative node detection sensitivity (S) was defined as the proportion of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) that were identified with each instrument, with the proportion determined as the number of true positives (TP) divided by the total evaluated (N). The outcome result is expressed as the percentage for each device with 95% confidence intervals., 1 day
Lymphoscintigraphy is an accepted and commonly-performed procedure used for staging of certain cancers, especially melanoma and breast cancer. It involves injecting a small amount of radioactivity under the skin in order to identify lymph nodes which should be biopsied (ie, the "sentinel lymph node, SLN") to determine if cancer has spread. The study objective was to evaluate the potential benefit of a new, camera-based technology (prototype device) which allows actual images to be obtained intra-operatively in the identification of sentinel nodes.

Each device was assessed for relative node detection sensitivity (S), defined as the proportion of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) that were identified with each instrument, with the proportion determined as the number of true positives (TP) divided by the total evaluated (N).
