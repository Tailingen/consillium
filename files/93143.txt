A Study to Assess Safety and Efficacy of Venetoclax in Combination With Gilteritinib in Participants With Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia
A dose-escalation study evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and efficacy of venetoclax, in combination with gilteritinib, in participants with relapsed or refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who have failed to respond to, and/or have relapsed or progressed after at least 1 prior therapy.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
DRUG: Venetoclax|DRUG: Gilteritinib
Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RPTD) of Co-administered Study Drugs, The RPTD of co-administered venetoclax and gilteritinib will be determined during the dose escalation phase of the study. RPTD will be determined using available safety and pharmacokinetics data., Up to approximately 6 months after the last participant is enrolled|Modified Composite Complete Remission (CRc), Modified CRc rate is defined as the proportion of participants with documented complete response (CR) + CR with partial blood count recovery (CRp) + CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) plus Morphologic Leukemia-Free State (MLFS) based on guidelines adapted from the International Working Group (IWG) for Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)., Up to approximately 6 months after the last participant is enrolled
Pharmacokinetics - Cmax of Venetoclax, Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) of study drug., Approximately 16 days after first dose of study drug|Pharmacokinetics - Cmax of Gilteritinib, Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) of study drug., Approximately 16 days after first dose of study drug|Pharmacokinetics - Tmax of Venetoclax, Time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) of study drug., Approximately 16 days after first dose of study drug|Pharmacokinetics - Tmax of Gilteritinib, Time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) of study drug., Approximately 16 days after first dose of study drug|Pharmacokinetics - AUCt of Venetoclax, Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve (AUC) from Time 0 to Time of the Last Measurable Concentration (AUCt) of study drug., Approximately 16 days after first dose of study drug|Pharmacokinetics - AUCt of Gilteritinib, Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve (AUC) from Time 0 to Time of the Last Measurable Concentration (AUCt) of study drug., Approximately 16 days after first dose of study drug|Pharmacokinetics - AUC0-24 Post-dose of Study Drug of Venetoclax, Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours (AUC24) post-dose of study drug., Approximately 16 days after first dose of study drug|Pharmacokinetics - AUC0-24 Post-dose of Study Drug of Gilteritinib, Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours (AUC24) post-dose of study drug., Approximately 16 days after first dose of study drug|Composite Complete Remission (CRc) Rate, CRc is defined as the proportion of participants with documented CR + CRp + CRi based on guidelines adapted from the International Working Group (IWG) for Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)., Up to approximately 6 months after the last participant is enrolled|Duration of Response (DOR) of Modified Composite Complete Remission (CRc), DOR of modified CRc will be defined as time from the first date achieving modified CRc to disease progression (including morphologic relapse) or death from any cause whichever is earlier., Up to approximately 6 months after the last participant is enrolled|Complete Remission (CR) + with Partial Hematologic Recovery (CRh), It is defined as the proportion of participants achieving CR or CRh based on guidelines adapted from the International Working Group (IWG) for Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)., Up to approximately 6 months after the last participant is enrolled|Duration of Response (DOR) of Complete Remission (CR) + Complete Remission with Partial Hematologic Recovery (CRh), DOR of CR + CRh will be defined as time from the first date achieving CR and/or CRh to disease progression (including morphologic relapse) or death from any cause whichever is earlier., Up to approximately 6 months after the last participant is enrolled|Number of Participants With Adverse Events, An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment., From first dose of study drug until 30 days or 5 half-lives after discontinuation of study drug administration will be collected (up to approximately 4 years)
