Ovarian Cyst's Enucleation Spillage Score
Cystic enucleation is one of the most common conservative surgeries in gynecology; it is commonly performed by a minimally invasive approach such as laparoscopy. A high percentage of these surgeries (6-88 % of cases) are complicated by the cystic rupture with intra-abdominal spillage of its contents (spillage). This occurrence affects the surgical and prognostic outcome by lengthening the time of surgery, increasing the risk of postoperative infection or granulomatous peritonitis, of possible second manifestation of the pathology (example: endometriosis), and in the case of neoformation of a carcinomatous nature by leading to an increase in the stage of disease, exposing patients to a prognostic disadvantage and the need for adjuvant treatments also avoidable. In addition, the previous spillage may be associated with the adherent syndrome with repercussions on patients' morbidity and fertility. For these reasons, it is crucial to optimize the selection of patients who are candidates for cystic enucleation.

The present study aims to evaluate a series of ultrasound, medical history, and surgical-preoperative parameters to develop a predictive score for the risk of spillage during laparoscopic surgery. Prospective Observational Study. The study aims to enroll 156 patients.
