Comparison of Continuous ESP Versus TEA After Thoracotomy
This prospective, randomized, assessor-blinded study is designed to evaluate the postoperative analgesic efficacy of the ultrasound-guided continuous erector spinae plane (ESP) block in patients undergoing thoracotomy. We hypothesize that US-guided ESP block is not inferior to thoracic epidural analgesia in terms of postoperative pain control in these patients.
Postoperative Pain
PROCEDURE: Erector spinae plane block group|PROCEDURE: Thoracic epidural analgesia group
Maximum postoperative pain score at rest on postoperative day 1, pain score measured by the 11-pointed numeric rating scale (0: none/10: worst pain), Maximum pain score among the 9 am and 4 pm measurements on postoperative day 1
Postoperative pain score at rest, Change in the pain score at rest measured by the 11-pointed numeric rating scale (0: none/10: worst pain) from postoperative day 1 to postoperative day 3, 9am/4pm on postoperative day 1, 9am/4pm on postoperative day 2, 9am/4pm on postoperative day 3|Postoperative pain score at movement, Change in the pain score at movement measured by the 11-pointed numeric rating scale (0: none/10: worst pain) from postoperative day 1 to postoperative day 3, 9am/4pm on postoperative day 1, 9am/4pm on postoperative day 2, 9am/4pm on postoperative day 3|Change in the total consumption (ml) of patient-controlled analgesia, total consumption (ml) of epidural or erector spinae plane patient-controlled analgesia, 9am/4pm on postoperative day 1, 9am/4pm on postoperative day 2, 9am/4pm on postoperative day 3|Change in the quality of recovery-15 scale from baseline to postoperative day 3, measured by the Korean version of the quality of recovery-15, Day before surgery and 4pm on postoperative day 3|Postoperative pulmonary function test, measured at outpatient clinic, 3 months after surgery|Incidence of chronic postoperative pain, measure by the Korean version of the pain DETECT, 3 months after surgery|Incidence of chronic postoperative pain, measure by the Korean version of the pain DETECT, 6 months after surgery
Adult patients undergoing elective unilateral thoracotomy for lung cancer resection are randomly allocated to receive US-guided ESP block (n=31) or thoracic epidural analgesia (n=31). Both procedures are performed prior to surgery. Each patient was assessed by a blinded investigator on postoperative day (POD) 1,2 and 3. The primary outcome is pain severity evaluated by a numeric rating scale (NRS) at POD1.
