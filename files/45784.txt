A Study of PM8002 in Combination With Chemotherapy in Patients With NEN
PM8002 is a bispecific antibody targeting PD-L1 and VEGF. This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of PM8002 in combination with FOLFIRI as second line treatment for neuroendocrine neoplasm (NEC and Ki-67≥55% G3 NET).
Neuroendocrine Neoplasm
DRUG: PM8002|DRUG: FOLFIRI
Objective Response Rate, Objective response rate (ORR) is the proportion of subjects with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), based on RECIST v1.1, Up to approximately 2 years|Treatment related adverse events (TRAEs), The incidence and severity of TRAEs graded according to NCI-CTCAE v5.0, Up to 30 days after last treatment
Disease control rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the proportion of subjects with CR, PR, or stable disease(SD) based on RECIST v1.1., Up to approximately 2 years|Duration of response (DoR), DoR is defined as the duration from the first documentation of objective response to the first documented disease progression (based on RECIST v1.1) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, Up to approximately 2 years|Progression free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the start of treatment until the first documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first (based on RECIST v1.1), Up to approximately 2 years|Overall survival (OS), OS is the time from the date of first dosing date to death due to any cause., Up to approximately 2 years
This is a phase II, single arm study assessing the efficacy and safety of PM8002 in combination with FOLFIRI as second line treatment for neuroendocrine neoplasm (NEC and Ki-67≥55% G3 NET) who failed first-line platinum-based chemotherapy
