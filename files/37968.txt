Neuropathic Pain in Head and Neck Cancer
The goal of this research study is to learn more about chronic pain associated with cancer treatment.
Head and Neck Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Questionnaires|OTHER: Quantitative Sensory Testing
Genome-wide analyses on Participants with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, Genome-wide analyses, 730,525 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), on participants with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck in order to identify potentially novel gene variants associated with the development of chronic pain (neuropathic versus nociceptive)., 5 years
Assessed Pain Severity (mean pain), Pain Severity determined using 0-10 numeric rating scale (0= 'no pain' and 10='worst pain imaginable'). Pain assessed at baseline (start of the study), weekly during treatment, and during clinic visits (every 6-8 weeks) for a period of 3 months after treatment., Baseline to 3 months post treatment
If you agree to take part in this study, you will complete the following tests and procedures at the beginning and at the end of the study (on clinic visits, typically around 3-6 months after completion of treatment):

Â°You will complete 5 questionnaires about any pain and other symptoms you may have had, your general well-being, drugs you may be taking, and personal information, such as your age. The questionnaires will take about 25-50 minutes to complete.

Every week during treatment period, you will complete a questionnaire about pain you may be having. This questionnaire will take about 5-10 minutes to complete.

Length of Study:

You will be on study for about 3-6 months after the last day of treatment.

This is an investigational study. Up to 1200 will take part at MD Anderson.
