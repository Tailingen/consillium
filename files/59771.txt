Feasibility of Radiofrequency Resection in Oropharyngeal Tumor Surgery
In the last years radiofrequency resection has become a frequent method in surgical subspecialties. Although many departments are using this method for the resection of Tumor in the oropharynx, there is no study so far which describes feasibility and safety.

Goal of this study is to show feasibility and safety of Radiofrequency Resection in Oropharyngeal Tumor Surgery.
