A Blood and Tissue Sample Collection Study of Patients Who Have Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Who Have Been Treated With Adalimumab and Who Developed Hepatosplenic T-Cell Lymphoma
To collect and store blood and biopsy samples obtained from CD or UC patients exposed to adalimumab and diagnosed with Hepatosplenic T-cell Lymphoma (HSTCL), for the purpose of identifying potential biomarkers and genetic mutations in patients who have developed HSTCL.
Crohn's Disease|Ulcerative Colitis (UC)|Hepatosplenic T-Cell Lymphoma
Collection of Samples, A study to bank blood and tissue samples for future evaluation to identify genetic mutations and other biomarkers that predispose inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients to developing Hepatosplenic T-Cell Lymphoma (HSTCL). Samples will be obtained from patients who have Crohn's Disease or Ulcerative Colitis, who have been treated with adalimumab and diagnosed with HSTCL., Up to 6 years
