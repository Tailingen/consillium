Niraparib Plus Anlotinib for Recurrent Ovarian Cancer
This is a phase II trial to explore efficacy and safety of niraparib in combination with anlotinib based on CA 125 level in newly diagnosed ovarian cancer. After completion of 1st-line platinum-based chemotherapy with a normal CA-125 concentration, in patients with CA-125 increased \> 35U/ml, and with no evidence of imaging recurrence, niraparib and anlotinib are used as 1st maintenance therapy for newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer after achieving complete or partial remission to platinum-containing chemotherapy. The primary objective of this study is to explore the efficacy of niraparib combined with anlotinib based on CA 125 level in newly diagnosed ovarian cancer with no evidence of imaging recurrence. A total o f36 patients will be enrolled in this study.
