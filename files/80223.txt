Investigation of Circulating Tumor Cells From Cancer Patients Undergoing Radiation Therapy
The purpose of this study is to investigate the level of Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) in cancer patients before and after undergoing treatment regimens where the primary treatment modality is radiation therapy (XRT). Specifically, there is interest in the change in CTCs pre- and post- XRT, both in absolute and relative terms.
Circulating Tumor Cells
OTHER: Blood draw
To measure CTCs levels to evaluate the change pre- and post-treatment separately in 10 cohorts of patients receiving radiation therapy., 24 months post-radiation
Change in CTC levels from Baseline to Post-RT treatment and the correlation with local tumor response or pathological evaluation, depending on cohort, 24 months post-radiation
CTCs measurements will be taken pre- and post-RT treatment. CTCs measurements will also be taken during treatment. The CTCs measurements from this study will provide essential information for the power and sample size considerations for future translational studies, particularly for those looking to identify biomarkers possibly associated with CTCs and tumor response activity after XRT, and to adequately power more formal statistical comparisons of important associations between CTCs and patient characteristics and outcomes.
