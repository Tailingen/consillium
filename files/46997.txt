Choice Architecture and Colorectal Cancer Screening Outreach
This pilot study is a 3-arm randomized control trial assessing the effectiveness of sequential or active choice in CRC (colorectal cancer) screening outreach vs. colonoscopy outreach only, in patients between 50-74 years old, who have received care at the University City or Valley Forge CCA (Community Care Associates) practices, are due for screening, and are asymptomatic for CRC. The three arms are: Arm 1: Direct schedule colonoscopy (Control), Arm 2: Direct schedule colonoscopy followed by mailed FIT(Fecal Immunochemical Test) (Sequential Choice), and Arm 3: Choice of direct schedule colonoscopy or mailed FIT (Active Choice).
