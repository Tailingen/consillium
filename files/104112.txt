ACTengine速 IMA203/IMA203CD8 as Monotherapy or in Combination With Nivolumab in Recurrent and/or Refractory Solid Tumors
The study purpose is to establish the safety and tolerability of IMA203/IMA203CD8 products with or without combination with nivolumab in patients with solid tumors that express preferentially expressed antigen in melanoma (PRAME).

SCREENING: Patient eligibility will be determined by protocol inclusion/exclusion criteria including HLA (human leukocyte antigen) screening and a biopsy (or collection of archival tumor tissue) for biomarker screening. If the patient is eligible, white blood cells will be taken during leukapheresis for the manufacture of an IMA203 or an IMA203CD8 product.

MANUFACTURING: IMA203 or IMA203CD8 products will be made from the patients' white blood cells.

TREATMENT: Lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine will occur in the days before the IMA203/IMA203CD8 product infusion to improve the duration of time that IMA203/IMA203CD8 product stays in the body. The patient will be admitted to the hospital during the T-cell infusion.

After the IMA203/IMA203CD8 product infusion, if applicable, a low dose of IL-2 will be given subcutaneously until day 10.

In Extension Cohort B (IMA203) nivolumab will be administered intravenously.

Patients will be monitored closely throughout the study. The follow-up phase ends 5 years post infusion.
