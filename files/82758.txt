Genotype-driven Phase I Study of Irinotecan Administered in Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy in Patients With Stage II/III Rectal Cancer
Irinotecan is one of effective drugs for colorectal cancer. In neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT), Irinotecan is prescribed in a low dose of 50mg/m2/week because of toxicity. Some current studies showed that irinotecan's dose can be increased significantly for those patients with 6/6 or 6/7 genotype of UGT1A1. therefore, the investigators designed this trial to explore the maximal tolerable dose (MTD) of Irinotecan in combined neoadjuvant CRT.
