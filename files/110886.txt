A Study of Subcutaneously Administered Herceptin (Trastuzumab) in Patients With Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2)-Positive Early Breast Cancer
This open-label, randomized crossover study evaluated the quality of life, efficacy, and safety of subcutaneous Herceptin (trastuzumab) injected either into the thigh or the upper arm of participants with early HER2-positive breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Trastuzumab - intravenous solution|DRUG: Trastuzumab - subcutaneous solution|DRUG: Chemotherapy
Quality of Life Score, Participants rated their quality of life on a visual analog scale (VAS) at the end of each cycle for Cycles 7-14. The left-end of the VAS represented the lowest-rated quality of life and the right-end of the VAS represented the highest-rated quality of life. Both the mean ratings for injections into the thigh and the upper arm and the minimum ratings for during injections into the thigh and the upper arm are reported. Quality of life scores ranged from 1 to 100 with a higher score indicating a better rated quality of life., Cycles 7-14 (Weeks 19-42, 24 weeks total)
Overall Survival, Overall survival was defined as the time in months from Baseline to death from any cause., Baseline to the end of the study (up to 54 weeks)|Disease-free Survival, Disease-free survival was defined as the time in months from Baseline to disease recurrence or death, whichever occurred first., Baseline to the end of the study (up to 54 weeks)|Health Care Provider's Satisfaction With the Injection Site, The health care provider for each participant was asked to rate their satisfaction with the 2 injection sites, thigh and upper arm, on a scale of 1 to 10, where 10 represents greater satisfaction. Ratings were made at the end of Cycles 10 and 14., End of Cycles 10 and 14 (Weeks 30 and 42)|Participant's Satisfaction With the Injection Site, Each participant was asked to rate their satisfaction with the 2 injection sites, thigh and upper arm, on a scale of 1 to 10, where 10 represents greater satisfaction. Ratings were made at the end of Cycles 10 and 14., End of Cycles 10 and 14 (Weeks 30 and 42)|Percentage of Participants Preferring Each Injection Site, Participants were asked which of the 2 injection sites was their preferred site at the end of Cycle 14., End of Cycle 14 (Week 42)
In the run-in phase, participants received trastuzumab intravenously every 3 weeks for 18 weeks (Cycles 1-6). They first received trastuzumab 8 mg/kg once (Cycle 1) followed by trastuzumab 6 mg/kg 5 times for 15 weeks (Cycles 2-6). Participants could also receive a maximum of 6 cycles of standard chemotherapy for early breast cancer (neo-adjuvant or adjuvant) in the run-in phase.

Following the run-in phase, participants were randomized to receive trastuzumab 600 mg subcutaneously every 3 weeks in the thigh and upper arm in a cross-over design for a total of 24 weeks (Cycles 7-14). They received trastuzumab either in the thigh first for 4 cycles (Cycles 7-10) followed by trastuzumab in the upper arm for 4 cycles (Cycles 11-14) or the upper arm first (Cycles 7-10) followed by the thigh (Cycles 11-14). For Cycles 15-18, participants could choose the injection site for trastuzumab 600 mg subcutaneously every 3 weeks.
