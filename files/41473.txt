A Clinical Trial to Evaluate Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of TQB2858 Injection in Subjects With Advanced Malignancy
A phase I clinical trial of tolerability and pharmacokinetics of TQB2858 injection in subjects with advanced malignancy.
Advanced Cervical Cancer
DRUG: TQB2858 injection
Objective response rates (ORR), Proportion of patients whose tumors shrank by a certain amount and remained for a certain period of time, including complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) ., Baseline to up to two years
Progress Free Survival(PFS), The period from the first use of the drug to disease progression or death (whichever occurs first), Baseline to up to two years|Disease Control Rate(DCR), Proportion of subjects whose tumors shrink or remain stable for a certain period, including complete remission（CR）, partial remission（PR） and stable disease（SD）, Baseline to up to two years|Duration of Response(DOR), The period from firstly-recorded objective tumor response (CR or PR) to firstly-recorded objective tumor progression or death due to any cause (whichever occurs first) ., Baseline to up to two years|Overall Survival(OS), The period from the first use of the drug to death from all causes. For subjects who are still alive at the last follow-up, the OS will be counted as data censored based on the last follow-up. For subjects who are lost follow-up, the OS will be counted as data censored based on the last confirmed survival time before being lost to follow-up., Baseline to up to two years|Occurrence of all adverse events (AE), serious adverse events (SAE), and treatment-related adverse events (TEAEs), Adverse events refer to all adverse medical events that occur after a patient or clinical trial subject receives an experimental drug, which can be expressed as symptoms, signs, diseases, or abnormalities in laboratory tests, but are not necessarily related to the treatment of the experimental drug. Serious adverse events refer to adverse medical conditions such as death, life threatening, permanent or severe disability, loss of function, the need for hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization , and congenital abnormalities or birth defects after the subject receives the experimental drug., Baseline to up to two years
