Safety and Efficacy of RAD001 + TACE in Localized Unresectable HCC
This study will evaluate the role of everolimus in combination with local Transcatheter Arterial Chemoembolization (TACE) procedure in patients with localized unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC).
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: everolimus|DRUG: everolimus placebo
Time to Progression (TTP) Based on the Modified RECIST Criteria, Time to Progression (TTP) defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documented radiological confirmation of disease progression based on modified RECIST criteria. Progressive Disease: \>20% increase in sum of the longest diameters (SLD) of "viable" target lesion (arterial phase enhancement), 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months
Overall Response Rate (ORR) and Disease Control Rate (DCR) Based on the Modified RECIST, Overall response rate was defined as the number of patients whose best overall response was either complete response or partial response according to the modified RECIST. Complete response: Disappearance of arterial phase enhance-ment in all target lesions. Partial response: \>30% decrease in sum of the longest diameters (SLD) of "viable" target lesion (arterial phase enhance-ment)Disease control rate was defined as the number of patients with a best overall response of complete response, partial response or stable disease. The study was terminated early due to slow enrollment of 4 years, higher than anticipated screen failure rate due to a higher than anticipated proportion of patients having advanced liver disease and a change in clinical practice the total of 80 patients was not reached with only 59 patients recruited in total. The study was underpowered due to termination therefore data was not collected and the outcome measure was not analyzed., 6, 12 months, end of study|Time to Progression Based on Original RECIST, Time to Progression (TTP) defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documented radiological confirmation of disease progression based on original RECIST criteria. Progressive Disease: \>20% increase in sum of the longest diameters (SLD) of target lesions with an absolute increase of â‰¥5 mm; new lesions. The study was terminated early due to slow enrollment of 4 years, higher than anticipated screen failure rate due to a higher than anticipated proportion of patients having advanced liver disease and a change in clinical practice the total of 80 patients was not reached with only 59 patients recruited in total. The study was underpowered due to termination therefore data was not collected and the outcome measure was not analyzed., 6, 12 months, end of study|Overall Response Rate (ORR) and Disease Control Rate (DCR) Based on Original RECIST, Overall response rate was defined as the number of patients whose best overall response was either complete response or partial response according to the Complete response: Disappearance of all target lesions or lymph nodes \<10 mm in the short axis Partial response: \>30% decrease in sum of the longest diameters (SLD) of target lesions Disease control rate was defined as the number of patients with a best overall response of complete response, partial response or stable disease. The study was terminated early due to slow enrollment of 4 years, higher than anticipated screen failure rate due to a higher than anticipated proportion of patients having advanced liver disease and a change in clinical practice the total of 80 patients was not reached with only 59 patients recruited in total. The study was underpowered due to termination therefore data was not collected and the outcome measure was not analyzed., 6, 12 months, end of study|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival was defined as the time from date of randomization to date of death due to any cause. If death had not occurred at the date of the analysis cut-off then OS was censored at the date of the last contact., 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 months|Incidences of Cumulative New Nodular Recurrence, Portal Vein Invasion and Extra Hepatic Metastases, Incidences of cumulative new nodular recurrence, portal vein invasion and extra hepatic metastases but incidence of portal vein invasion meant those patients without documented vascular invasion at screening/baseline. The study was terminated early due to slow enrollment of 4 years, higher than anticipated screen failure rate due to a higher than anticipated proportion of patients having advanced liver disease and a change in clinical practice the total of 80 patients was not reached with only 59 patients recruited in total. The study was underpowered due to termination therefore data was not collected and the outcome measure was not analyzed., 30 months|Percentage of Participants With a Decrease in the Sum of the of Longest Diameters (SLD) of Target Lesions From Baseline to 30 Months, Percentage of participants with a decrease in the sum of the of longest diameters (SLD) of target lesions from Baseline to 30 months, baseline, 30 months
This study will evaluate the role of everolimus in combination with local Transcatheter Arterial Chemoembolization (TACE) procedure in patients with localized unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC).
