A Study to Investigate the Safety of SYHA1815 in Subjects With Unresectable Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is a multi-center, open-label, dose escalation and expansion, phase I study to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) characteristics, preliminary efficacy of SYHA1815 in subjects with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Once the expected effective dose is identified, the dose expansion study will be started to further evaluate the safety, clinical activity and PK profile of SYHA1815 in subjects with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

This is a multi-center, open-label, dose escalation and expansion, phase I study to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) characteristics, preliminary efficacy of SYHA1815 in subjects with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The dose escalation study will include six dose cohorts starting at 2 mg/day. Once the expected effective dose is identified, the dose expansion study will be started to further evaluate the safety, clinical activity and PK profile of SYHA1815 in subjects with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
