Leukemia Cell Cultures for Research of New Anti-Cancer Therapies
The main objective of this project is not only a better understanding of the human leukemic disease but also to find new anti-leukemic or improve existing ones. This study has, the following aims:

* To analyze the genetic and epigenetic regulation of the retinoic acid induced cascade which leads to the expression of TRAIL in blood cells of patients with acute leukemia. This study will be complemented by the analysis of global gene expression (DNA chips) and of the DNA methylation state, and by chromatin immunoprecipitation experiences.
* To determine the efficiency of inhibitors of enzymes responsible for the modification of chromatin (existing and new developments within the European consortium EPITRON coordinated by Dr Gronemeyer) as inducers of differentiation and / or apoptosis of leukemic blasts.
* To explore Ikaros genic and functional abnormalities (genomic deletions, mutations, abnormal transcripts and proteins) in acute leukemia. The aim is to determine if these abnormalities may play a prognosis role.
