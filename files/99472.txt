An Open-label, Multicenter, Multiple Dose, Phase 1 Study to Establish the Maximum Tolerated Dose of E7389 Liposomal Formulation in Patients With Solid Tumors
Study E7389-E044-112 is a Phase 1 study designed to assess the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of eribulin-liposomal formulation (E7389-LF) in patients with solid tumors. This dose-escalation study will determine the maximum tolerated dose, dosing schedules tested, the dose schedule regimen with a more favorable tolerability profile, and a preliminary indication of efficacy.
Solid Tumors
DRUG: Eribulin-LF
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Eribulin-LF, The MTD was defined as the highest dose level at which no more than 1/6 participants experienced a dose limiting toxicity (DLTs), with the next higher dose having at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 participants experiencing DLTs. MTD was determined by summarizing the number and percentage of participants with DLTs for the first cycle, by study dosing schedule, initial dosing level and overall for the dose escalation part. For participants who continued to Cycle 2, the DLTs which occurred from 1st dose up to the day before Day 1 of Cycle 2 were counted. For participants who discontinued before Cycle 2, the DLTs which occurred from 1st dose up to Day 21 (Schedule 1) or Day 28 (Schedule 2) of Cycle 1 were counted. DLTs were evaluated and graded based on the National Cancer Institutes (NCI)'s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03., Schedule 1: Cycle 1 (21 days); Schedule 2: Cycle 1 (28 days)|Dose Limiting Toxicities at the Indicated Dose Levels, as an Assessment of Dosing Frequency, DLTs were evaluated for both Schedule 1 and Schedule 2. DLTs were defined as neutropenia grade 4 that lasted more than 5 days, neutropenia grade 3 or 4 complicated by fever and/or infection (absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 1.0 x 10\^9/liter, fever greater than or equal to 38.5 degrees Celsius), thrombocytopenia grade 4 of any duration, thrombocytopenia grade 3 complicated by bleeding and/or requiring platelet or blood transfusion, hypersensitivity reaction grade 3 or 4 including allergy reactions or anaphylaxis; symptomatic bronchospasm requiring parenteral medication(s) with our without urticarial; allergy-related edema/angioedema, or other grade 3 or 4 clinically significant non-hematologic toxicities (except for inadequately treated nausea and /or vomiting) considered related to study drug. Participants with two or more adverse events in the same system organ class (or with the same preferred term) was counted only once for that system organ class (or preferred term)., Cycle 1 of Dose Escalation part in Schedule 1 and Schedule 2
Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability of Eribulin-LF, Safety was assessed by the monitoring and recording of all adverse events (AEs), and serious AEs (SAEs), regular monitoring of hematology, clinical chemistry, and urine values; periodic measurement of vital signs, electrocardiograms; and the performance of physical examinations. For each row category, a participant with two or more adverse events in that category is counted only once. Treatment-related TEAEs include TEAEs that were considered by the Investigator to be possibly or probably related to study drug and TEAEs with a missing relationship to study drug., From date of first dose until 30 days after the final dose of study drug, up to approximately 3 years 6 months|Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of Eribulin-LF, Blood samples for Schedule 1 were drawn on Cycle 1/Day 1 and Cycle 3/Day 1 predose, 15 minutes (min) after the start of infusion (SOI), 5 min after the end of infusion (EOI), 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours (h) postdose, and Day 4, Day 7, Day 9, and Day 11.

Individual ECGs were extracted in triplicate from the Holter recordings at specified time points and were evaluated by a central laboratory. QT intervals were measured from Lead II and were corrected for heart rate (QTc) using Fridericia's (QTcF) and Bazett's (QTcB) correction factors. The primary QTc parameter was QTcF. Secondary parameters (QTcB, QT, QRS, and hazard ratio/heart rate (HR)) and waveforms (T-waves) were evaluated.

This is a Phase 1 first-in-human, non-randomized (individuals will not be assigned by chance to study treatments), open-label (individuals will know the identity of study treatments), multicenter, 2-part, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (study of what the body does to a drug) of eribulin-LF administered intravenously to patients with solid tumors. Each treatment cycle will be 21 days (Schedule 1) or 28 days (Schedule 1a or 2). Part 1 is the dose-escalation phase, which will be guided by pharmacokinetics and safety. Three to 6 new patients will be enrolled in sequential cohorts (first cohort will receive the starting dose and subsequent cohorts will receive increased doses of eribulin-LF). Enrollment in each cohort will be staggered; the second and third participant in every cohort will not be dosed until the first patient in that cohort completes 2 weeks of Cycle 1. If no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) have been observed during the first 2 week of Cycle 1 in the first patient, the second and third patients in the cohort will initiate treatment. Enrollment will be first initiated into cohort 1 of Schedule 1 (dosing on Day 1 of 21 day cycle). Interim analysis will be conducted upon completion of this cohort. The following decisions will be made based upon the results of the interim analysis 1) proceed with escalating to next dose level (cohort 2) of Schedule 1 (dosing on Day 1 of 21 day cycle) and initiate cohort 1 of Schedule 2 (dosing on Day 1 and Day 15 of 28 day cycle), or 2) discontinue plans to evaluate Schedule 2 and initiate Schedule 1a (dosing on Day 1 of 28 day cycle).

After the last patient in each cohort completes Cycle 1, the safety for DLT determination will be evaluated and a decision will be made on whether to escalate the dose in a new cohort of 3 to 6 new patients. Dose escalation will halt when the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached. The total number of patients to be enrolled in Part 1 will depend on the dose level at which the DLT will be achieved. After MTD for each schedule is determined, patients will be enrolled into Expansion Part of the study to confirm safety and tolerability of each dosing schedule. Nine to 12 patients will be treated with MTD for each schedule for 6 cycles. The total study duration for each participant will be approximately 18 months.
