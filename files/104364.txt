Letrozole in Treating Breast Cancer in Postmenopausal Women With Stage I, II, or III Breast Cancer Previously Treated With Tamoxifen (GIM4)
RATIONALE: Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Letrozole may fight breast cancer by lowering the amount of estrogen the body makes. It is not yet known which regimen of letrozole is most effective in treating breast cancer in postmenopausal women who have received tamoxifen.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is comparing different regimens of letrozole to see how well they work in treating postmenopausal women with stage I, stage II, or stage III breast cancer previously treated with tamoxifen.

OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To compare the disease-free survival of previously treated, post-menopausal women with early-stage breast cancer treated with standard- (2-3 years of tamoxifen followed by 2-3 years of letrozole) versus long-treatment (2-3 years of tamoxifen followed by 5 years of letrozole) adjuvant letrozole.

Secondary

* To compare the overall survival of these patients.
* To compare the safety of these patients.

OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 or 2 treatment arms.

* Arm I (standard treatment): Patients previously treated with tamoxifen for 2 years receive letrozole for an additional 3 years; patients previously treated with tamoxifen for 3 years receive letrozole for an additional 2 years; and patients previously treated with tamoxifen for 2-3 years receive letrozole , so the total duration of the endocrine treatment (i.e., tamoxifen followed by letrozole) is 5 years.
* Arm II (long treatment): Patients receive letrozole for an additional 5 years regardless of the duration of the previous tamoxifen treatment.
