A Dose-escalation, Dose-finding, and Expansion Study of XL495 in Participants With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
The goal of this study is to obtain safety, tolerability, PK, and preliminary clinical antitumor activity for XL495 as a single agent and in combination with select cytotoxic agents in participants with locally advanced or metastatic tumors for whom life-prolonging therapies do not exist or available therapies are intolerable/no longer effective.

DRUG: XL495|DRUG: ADC cytotoxic agents
Dose-escalation and Dose-finding Stages: Number of Participants with Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, Up to 18 months|Dose-escalation and Dose-finding Stages: Number of Participants with Dose-limiting Toxicities, Up to 18 months|Expansion Stage: Number of Participants with Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, Up to 19 months|Expansion Stage: Objective Response Rate (ORR) As Assessed by Investigator Per RECIST 1.1, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with the best overall response (BOR) of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR), as assessed by the Investigator per RECIST 1.1., Until disease progression or death, up to approximately 19 months
Dose-escalation and Dose-finding Stages: Concentration of XL495 in Plasma, Pre-dose and multiple post-dose time points, up to 18 months|Dose-escalation and Dose-finding Stages: Pharmacokinetic (PK) Parameter Area Under the Plasma Concentration Time Curve (AUC) of XL495, Pre-dose and multiple post-dose time points, up to 18 months|Dose-escalation and Dose-finding Stages: PK Parameter Maximum Plasma Concentration of XL495 (Cmax), Pre-dose and multiple post-dose time points, up to 18 months|Dose-escalation and Dose-finding Stages: PK Parameter Time to Cmax of XL495 (Tmax), Pre-dose and multiple post-dose time points, up to 18 months|Dose-escalation and Dose-finding Stages: PK Parameter Apparent Clearance with Oral Administration of XL495 (CL/F), Pre-dose and multiple post-dose time points, up to 18 months|Dose-escalation and Dose-finding Stages: PK Parameter Apparent Terminal Elimination Half-life of XL495 (t1/2), Pre-dose and multiple post-dose time points, up to 18 months|Expansion Stage: Duration of Response (DOR) As Assessed by Investigator per RECIST 1.1, DOR is defined as the time from the first documented objective response (CR or PR) until the earlier of radiographic progressive disease (PD) as assessed by the investigator per RECIST 1.1 or censoring due to lack of these events or start of non-protocol anti-cancer therapy., Until disease progression or death, up to approximately 19 months.|Expansion Stage: Progression-free Survival (PFS), as Assessed by Investigator per RECIST 1.1, PFS is defined as the time from start of study treatment to the earlier of either radiographic PD per RECIST 1.1 or death from any cause., Until disease progression or death, up to approximately 19 months.|Expansion Stage: Concentration of XL495 in Plasma, Pre-dose and multiple post-dose time points, up to 18 months|Expansion Stage: Pharmacokinetic (PK) Parameter Area Under the Plasma Concentration Time Curve (AUC) of XL495, Pre-dose and multiple post-dose time points, up to 18 months|Expansion Stage: PK Parameter Maximum Plasma Concentration of XL495 (Cmax), Pre-dose and multiple post-dose time points, up to 18 months|Expansion Stage: PK Parameter Time to Cmax of XL495 (Tmax), Pre-dose and multiple post-dose time points, up to 18 months|Expansion Stage: PK Parameter Apparent Clearance with Oral Administration of XL495 (CL/F), Pre-dose and multiple post-dose time points, up to 18 months|Expansion Stage: PK Parameter Apparent Terminal Elimination Half-life of XL495 (t1/2), Pre-dose and multiple post-dose time points, up to 18 months
