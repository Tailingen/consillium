New Formulation Study of Inupadenant (EOS100850) in Patients with Cancer
A2A-004 is a three-part multicenter, open-label, Phase I clinical trial intended to evaluate the safety and tolerability, and the pharmacokinetics (PK) and food effect of new formulations of inupadenant (formerly known as EOS100850), in participants with advanced solid tumors.
Solid Tumor, Adult
DRUG: Inupadenant|DRUG: Inupadenant|DRUG: Inupadenant
Incidence of Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) in patients with advanced solid tumors receiving inupadenant, Incidence of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), DLTs, AEs leading to discontinuation, deaths, electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities, and clinically significant laboratory abnormalities, During the DLT evaluation period that is cycle 1 (each cycle is 4 weeks)|Incidence and severity of AEs in patients receiving inupadenant, To assess safety and tolerability as measured by incidence and severity of AEs, Through study completion, an average of 4 months
Plasma concentration of inupadenant vs. time profiles, Determined by inspection of the concentration-time profile, Through study completion, an average of 4 months|Maximum observed serum concentration (Cmax), Determined by inspection of the concentration-time profile, Through study completion, an average of 4 months|Time of maximum observed concentration (Tmax), Determined by inspection of the concentration-time profile, Through study completion, an average of 4 months|Area under the concentration-time curve in 1 dosing interval [AUC(TAU)], Determined by inspection of the concentration-time profile, Through study completion, an average of 4 months|Plasma concentration half-life (T-HALF), Determined by inspection of the concentration-time profile, Through study completion, an average of 4 months|Overall response rate per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, Assessment of preliminary efficacy of inupadenant, Through study completion, an average of 4 months
