A Study on the Efficacy and Safety of Multi-mode Ablation Combined With Systemic Therapy in the Treatment of CRCLM
The goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of multi-mode ablation combined with systemic therapy including PD-1(programmed death receptor 1) inhibitor for colorectal cancer liver metastasis and furthermore to clarify its application value by comparing preoperative and postoperative immune indicators.
Colorectal Cancer Liver Metastasis
DEVICE: Multi-mode tumor treatment system|DRUG: Sintilimab+mFOLFOX6 or FOLFIRI+bevacizumab or cetuximab
Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the start of treatment until the criteria for documented progression of disease (or until death due to any cause) are met, whichever comes first according to RECIST 1.1., max 24 months
Local Progression Free Survival (LPFS), Local progression-free survival (LPFS) is defined as the time from the start of treatment until documented local progression of the lesion(s) under assessment, or until death from any cause, whichever comes first according to RECIST 1.1., max 24 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of patients with a complete response or partial response to treatment according to RECIST 1.1., max 24 months|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from the start of treatment until death from any cause., max 24 months|Rate of adverse events, The rate of adverse events will be calculated as the number of participants experiencing any adverse event divided by the total number of participants enrolled in the study., max 24 months|Immune indicator analysis, Immune indicator analysis will be conducted to evaluate the immune status and response of participants to the intervention. This will include the assessment of various immune cell populations and markers, such as:

* CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte counts and ratios.
* Natural Killer (NK) cell activity and counts.
* B cell counts and subsets.
* Dendritic cell (DC) counts and functionality.
* Monocyte counts and subsets.
* Neutrophil, eosinophil and basophil counts.
* Myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) counts. The analysis will utilize flow cytometry to quantify these immune indicators from blood samples collected at specified time points before, during and after the intervention., max 24 months
This is a single-center, single-arm, prospective study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of multi-mode ablation combined with systemic therapy including PD-1 inhibitor in the treatment of colorectal cancer liver metastasis. The study includes 20 patients with colorectal cancer liver metastasis that has failed first-line therapy and is unresectable. All patients will receive multi-mode ablation to achieve complete remission of liver lesions followed by systemic therapy including PD-1 inhibitor.

This study will provide preliminary data on the efficacy and safety of multi-mode ablation combined with systemic therapy including PD-1 inhibitor in the treatment of colorectal cancer liver metastasis, which could lead to larger randomized trials.
