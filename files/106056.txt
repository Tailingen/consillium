Comparison Study of EAP and CG Regimens for Mobilizing Hematopoietic Stem Cells in Multiple Myeloma Patients
This is a prospective, randomized, two-arm, multicenter, exploratory study aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of the combination of etoposide, cytarabine and Pegfilgrastim (EAP regimen) for mobilizing hematopoietic stem cells in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM). A total of 99 NDMM patients will be enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either the EAP regimen or the GC regimen (cyclophosphamide+ G-CSF) to mobilize hematopoietic stem cells. Subsequently, the mobilization effects and adverse reactions of all patients will be observed and compared.

According to strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, 99 newly diagnosed MM patients will be selected. They will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to the EAP group or the CG group. During the hematopoietic stem cell mobilization period, comparison study will be conducted regarding the proportion of patients who achieve the ideal collection value (CD34 cells \>5×10\^6/kg) after a single collection; the proportion of patients who cumulatively achieve the target collection value (CD34 cells \>2×10\^6/kg) and the ideal collection value; the cumulative collection of CD34 cells and the average number of collections; and the hematological and non-hematological adverse reactions of the EAP and CG regimens. Special attention will be given to the proportion of patients who add Plerixafor in both regimens.
