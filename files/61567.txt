A Study of Optical Imaging With Light From Radiotracers in Cancer Patients
The purpose of this study is to test Cerenkov luminescence imaging, which is a different way to take pictures of thyroid cancer and/or any tumors with (existing or suspected) nodal metastases in the neck, supraclavicular, axillary and/or inguinal region.
Thyroid Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Cerenkov luminescence imaging.
Feasibility of clinical Cerenkov luminescence imaging by achieving satisfactory imaging at least a rate of 80%, The primary objective is to explore the overall feasibility of clinical Cerenkov imaging on patients with any tumors with nodal metastases (existing or suspected) scheduled for routine clinical FDG PET or 131I therapy., Through study completion, an average of 24 hours
