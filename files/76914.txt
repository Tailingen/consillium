The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of concurrent chemoradiotherapy combined with Itraconazole in patients with locally adcvanced esophageal squamous cancer
Esophageal Neoplasm|Esophageal Diseases|Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: itraconazole
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR was evaluated 4-8 weeks after completion of RT and was recorded according to RECIST, version 1.1, 4-8 weeks
Treatment-emergent adverse events, Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events would be assessed based on the common toxicity criteria for adverse events version 4.0 (CTCAE v4.0) and EORTC criterion., year 0 - year 1|Local-regional free survival (LRFS), LRFS was calculated from the date of treatment initiation to the date of documented failure., year 0 - year 3|Overall survival (OS), OS was determined as the time (in months) between the first day of therapy and the last follow-up or the date of death., year 0 - year 3
Esophageal cancer is one of the most lethal malignancies. Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the predominant type in China, accounting for over 90% of all esophageal cancer. Concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT) remains the standard therapy of locally advanced ESCC. However, the outcome remains poor.

The aberrant activation of Hedgehog (HH) signaling is associated with a variety of human malignancies. Previous studies found that the reactivation of HH pathway occurs in 60% of esophageal cancer. Targeting the Hh pathway for cancer therapy was expected to work wonders in Hh-dependent cancers. Itraconazole, an antifungal agent, has been shown to inhibit the Hh and AKT signaling pathways.

The aim of our study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of concurrent chemoradiotherapy combined with Itraconazole in patients with locally adcvanced esophageal squamous cancer
