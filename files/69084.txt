This study is a single-arm, open label, phase I/II clinical trial to evaluate the safety, efficacy and cellular kinetics of CT032 CAR-CD19 T cells in patients with R/R B-NHL. The study is composed of two stages, Phase I stage is for dose escalation and recommendation of phase 2 dose, and Phase II stage is to verify the efficacy and safety of the dose proposed.
