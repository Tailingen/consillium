A Phase I Study of AC0010 in Patients With CLL/ SLL, MCL, DLBCL and Other NHL
This is an open label, dose escalation, phase I study to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (PR2D) by assessing the DLT, safety and efficacy of AC0010 in patients with B-cell lymphoma.

This is an open label, dose escalation, phase I study to determine the PR2D by assessing the DLT, safety and efficacy of AC0010 in patients with B-cell lymphoma. This study includes two parts. During Part 1 Dose Escalation, the "3+3" design will be applied. Dose escalation will begin at dose level 1 = 400 mg. This dose escalation will be followed by an exploratory expansion phase in 3 or 4 groups of 15\~41 patients each (CLL group, MCL group, non-germinal center B cell-like DLBCL group, and/or FL/WM(macroglobulinemia) group). The study will further evaluate the safety and efficacy of AC0010 in these patients in each group
