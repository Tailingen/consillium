The Study of JS001 Compared to High-Dose Interferon In Patients With Mucosal Melanoma That Has Been Removed by Surgery
This is a phase II randomized, control, multi-center study of recombinant humanized anti-PD-1 mAb for injection compared to high-Dose interferon in patients with mucosal melanoma that has been removed by surgery.
Mucosal Melanoma
BIOLOGICAL: humanized anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody Toripalimab|BIOLOGICAL: high-dose recombinant interferon a-2B
Recurrence-free survival rate, to evaluate the Recurrence free survival (RFS) of the patients with mucosal melanoma treated by JS001 and high-Dose interferon, 5 years
Distant metastases-free survival, to evaluate the distant metastases-free survival of the patients with mucosal melanoma treated by JS001 and high-Dose interferon, 5 years|recurrence - free survival rate at 3 years, to evaluate the recurrence - free survival rate at 3 years of the patients with mucosal melanoma treated by JS001 and high-Dose interferon, 3 years|Overall survival (OS), to evaluate the Overall survival (OS) of the patients with mucosal melanoma treated by JS001 and high-Dose interferon, 5 years|Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events, Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, 5 years
This is a multi-centreï¼Œopen, randomized, parallel-group study of mucosal melanoma adjuvant therapy to evaluate the efficacy of recombinant humanized anti-PD-1 mAb for injection compared to high-Dose interferon in patients with mucosal melanoma that has been removed by surgery.There will be 220 subjects enrolling the study, and randomized 1:1 grouped into recombinant humanized anti-PD-1 mAb for injection group (experimental group) or interferon group (control group).Each group will have 110 subjects.Random stratification factor is the disease stage (I vs II vs III).The whole research lasts about 60 months.
