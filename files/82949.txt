Effects of Scalp Nerve Blocks on Systemic Inflammation
Patients undergoing meningeoma resection surgery will be randomly assigned to two groups. One group will receive scalp nerve blocks with 0.5% ropivacaine, whereas the other group will receive scalp nerve blocks with 0.9% saline after anesthesia induction and before skull-pin insertion. Serum levels of TNF-α、IL-6 and IL-1β will be measured and compared at before surgery, 1h, 24h and 72h after surgery, respectively. VAS score, dosage of pain-control medicine and NRS score at the first three days after surgery, ratio of intracranial infection within 30d after surgery, and total hospitalization days and medical expenditure will also be recorded and compared between the two groups.
