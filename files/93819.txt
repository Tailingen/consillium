Radiotherapy for Prostate and Oligo-metastatic Lesions in Patients With Low-burden Oligo-metastatic Prostate Cancer
The existing large prospective study demonstrates the benefits of primary radiotherapy in patients with low-volume oligo-metastatic prostate cancer (OMPC), and there is also more evidence of the benefits of local metastasis-directed therapy (MDT) for metastatic lesions. But there is no results from prospective study to demonstrate the efficacy of radiotherapy for prostate and oligo-metastases. Therefore, the aim of the protocol is to illustrate the efficacy of radiotherapy for prostate and oligo-metastatic lesions in patients with de novo OMPC.

progression-free survival 2 (PFS2), To assess the duration from the reinitiation of endocrine therapy until the identification of disease progression again., through study completion, an average of 3 years
ADT free survival, To assess the timeframe between the completion of the initial ADT treatment and the onset of the subsequent ADT treatment., through study completion, an average of 3 years|self-assessment of quality of life (QoL) and patient satisfaction, To evaluate utilizing QoL questionnaires.In the EQ-5D descriptive system five dimensions are assessed: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Patients are asked to rate each dimension on a scale ranging from 'no problems'(1) to 'unable to/ extreme problems'(5).The VAS is a vertical scale ranging from 0 to 100 where 0 indicates worst imaginable health and 100 indicates best imaginable health., through study completion, an average of 3 years|5-year overall survival (OS), To assess the duration from enrollment until death from any cause or the last follow-up., Assessment overall survival (OS) at 5 years
This study involves a single-center, limited-sample, single-arm exploration of radiotherapy for prostate and oligo-metastatic lesions in patients diagnosed with low-volume, hormone-sensitive OMPC. Eligible participants undergo thorough assessments and treatment involving endocrine therapy alongside radiation targeting metastatic lesions and the pelvic region. All patients received radiation therapy for both the primary and metastatic lesions combined endocrine therapy. Endocrine therapy with an antiandrogen (bicalutamide,for 4 weeks) androgen deprivation therapy combined with novel hormonal agents (acetate abiraterone), which will be continued for 2 years. The primary objective is to evaluate progression-free survival-2 (PFS-2), while secondary endpoints include ADT free survival, quality of life (QoL), overall survival, time to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), radiation-related complications and endocrine therapy related adverse events.
