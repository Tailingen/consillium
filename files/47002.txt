Hybrid Arc Palliative Radiation Therapy (HART): a Single Arm Phase II Trial
This is a prospective single-center single-arm Phase II trial of HART for patients with metastatic cancer. The primary objective is to assess the incidence of acute GI toxicity following HART. PRO-CTCAE GI scores observed in the study patients will be compared to historical rates. Secondary outcomes include measuring changes in health-related quality of life, esophageal quality of life, toxicity, dosimetric outcomes, and pain.

Incidence of acute gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity, Th incidence of acute gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity (defined as a score of â‰¥2) at 4 weeks post-treatment initiation will be measured and compared to historical data, using PRO-CTCAE GI scores to determine if HART reduces GI toxicity., 4 weeks
patient-reported health-related quality of life, Changes in patient-reported health-related quality of life (HRQOL) following HART treatment will be measured, as assessed by the EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL questionnaire from baseline measurements., 4 weeks|patient-reported esophageal quality of life, To assess changes in patient-reported esophageal quality of life (QOL) following HART, as measured by the Esophageal Cancer Subscale (ECS) of the FACT-E for thoracic disease, from baseline measurements., 4 weeks|physician graded toxicity, Assess physician graded toxicity using NCI-CTCAE v5., 4 weeks|dosimetric outcomes of HART, To compare the dosimetric outcomes of HART and conventional AP/PA plans by analyzing dose-volume histograms, with a specific focus on the gastrointestinal organs at risk., 4 weeks|pain scale, To evaluate pain scale changes as a surrogate marker for tumor response from baseline to post-HART., 4 weeks
Palliative radiation therapy is often used to improve quality of life for patients with metastatic cancer, but severe gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities can limit its effectiveness. HART (Hybrid Arc Radiation Therapy) combines dynamic conformal arcs with conventional radiation beams to deliver more precise dose distributions while sparing healthy organs. This study explores whether HART can reduce acute GI toxicities compared to traditional methods, using validated measures like PRO-CTCAE scores. The goal is to improve patient adherence, reduce side effects, and enhance quality of life, while addressing the lack of clinical data on HART's safety and effectiveness in palliative care.
