A Randomized, Double-blind,Phase â…¢ Study of Liposome Doxorubicin in Desmoid Tumor
The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of liposomal doxorubicin in the treatment of desmoid tumors. Unless the subject withdraws from the trial voluntarily, or the researcher considers that the subject is not suitable for further trial, each subject will be treated until the disease progresses or the toxic and side effects caused by the drug are intolerable, and then enter the survival follow-up period
Desmoid Tumor
DRUG: Liposome doxorubicin|DRUG: Saline Solution
PFS, Progression Free Survival Rate, 24 months
ORR, Overall Response Rate, 24 months|Patient Reported Outcomes-Common Terminology Criteria in Adverse Events version 5.0, Patient Reported Outcomes-Common Terminology Criteria in Adverse Events version 5.0 was used to evaluate the toxicity. The evaluation time is 2 years. The data of patients who crossover or receive surgical or radiotherapy intervention will be summarized independently of their main research and treatment processes., 24 months
A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to compare (PFS) differences in progression-free survival in patients treated with liposome doxorubicin or placebo. PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression or death caused by any cause. If the disease is stable, PFS will be calculated at the time of the last follow-up in the study. Patients who have reached the maximum follow-up period and have no progress will be reviewed on the date of the last disease assessment. The crossover data of the patients were analyzed and summarized separately from the data of the main treatment process.In this study, 72 patients were expected to be enrolled in the group for 12 months and followed up for 24 months.Patients will be randomized to receive liposome adriamycin (50mg/m2) or intravenous placebo for a treatment cycle of once every 28 days.Duration of medication: a total of 6 cycles, or to the progression of the disease, tolerable toxicity, whichever occurs first.As the disease progresses, patients treated with placebo will be allowed to enter the unblinded liposome adriamycin group.
