A Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy Study of NC410 Plus Pembrolizumab in Participants with Advanced Unresectable or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is an open-label, non-randomized, Phase 1b/2 study to determine the safety and tolerability of NC410 when combined with a standard dose of pembrolizumab. This study will also assess the clinical benefit of combination therapy in participants with advanced unresectable and/or metastatic ICI refractory solid tumors OR ICI naïve MSS/MSI-low solid tumors
