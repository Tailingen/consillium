A Study of Darbepoetin Alfa for the Treatment of Anemia in Subjects With Non-Myeloid Malignancy Receiving Multicycle Chemotherapy
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of darbepoetin alfa as 500ug once every 3 weeks to show that the dose and schedule are not inferior to darbepoetin alfa administered as 2.25ug/kg once per week in the treatment of anemia in subjects with non-myeloid malignancies.
