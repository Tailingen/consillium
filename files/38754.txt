Lorlatinib as the First-line Treatment in China Advanced ALK+ NSCLC
This phase II study is aim to investigate the efficacy, resistance mechanism, safety profile of first-line lorlatinib in China advanced ALK+ non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Participants will receive continuous daily PO dosing of lorlatinib 100mg QD.
ALK Positive Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Loratinib
PFS, Progression Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from start of lorlatinib treatment to the date of disease progression as defined by RECIST v1.1 per investigator review or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first., From date of first dosing to first documented progression or death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 3 years.|Resistance mechanism of lorlatinib, Resistance mechanism of first-line lorlatinib treatment by tumor tissue, and peripheral blood ctDNA (circulating tumor Deoxyribonucleic acid) biomarkers including, but not limited to, ALK gene rearrangement and/or ALK kinase domain mutations as measured by next-generation sequencing (NGS);, From date of first dosing to first documented progression or death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 3 years.
This is a patient-centric, two cohorts, open-label, multi-center, phase II study in China, designed to prospectively enroll 126 advanced ALK+NSCLC patients, including 84 subjects fulfilled CROWN criteria as "CROWN criteria (CC) cohort", and another 42 subjects beyond CROWN criteria as "compassionate use (CU) cohort". Subjects will receive continuous daily PO dosing of lorlatinib 100mg QD, from the date of first dosing until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal for any reason, or death, whichever occurs first. The primary endpoints are progression-free survival (PFS) of CC cohort per investigator, and resistance mechanism of first-line lorlatinib. Secondary endpoints are 1/2/3-year PFS, cumulative rate of central nervous system (CNS) progression, intracranial-time to progression (IC-TTP), objective response rate (ORR) and intracranial ORR (IC-ORR), overall survival (OS), safety and PRO. Exploratory endpoints include evaluation of candidate biomarkers of sensitivity or resistance to lorlatinib, dynamic ctDNA change during treatment, and effective treatment after lorlatinib resistance.
