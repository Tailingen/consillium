Success of Paravertebral Blocks in Analgesia for Interventional Hepatic Procedures
This study is aimed at assessing whether performing a paravertebral block (a type of regional pain relief) can reduce the pain and anxiety patients experience during radiological procedures on the liver.
Liver Neoplasms
PROCEDURE: Paravertebral block|PROCEDURE: Control sham procedure
Dose of intravenous sedation required during and after the procedure, 1 hour
Improvement in analogue pain scoring after the procedure, 1 hour|Procedure duration, 1 hour|Complication rate of liver procedure, 24 hours|Complication rate of paravertebral block, 1 hour
Percutaneous procedures of the liver can be very painful and range from bliliary drain insertions to tumor ablation procedures. The study will randomize patients in two groups, one receiving a paravertebral nerve block prior to the procedure and one receiving a sham procedure in which saline will be injected in the paravertebral space. Pain scores and use of IV sedation will be monitored post procedure and both groups will be compared to assess whether paravetebral nerve blocks are effective at reducing pain in patients receiving such procedures.
