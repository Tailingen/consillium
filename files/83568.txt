PONAZA : A COMBINATION OF PONATINIB AND 5-AZACITIDINE IN CHRONIC MYELOGENOUS LEUKAEMIA IN ACCELERATED PHASE OR IN MYELOID BLAST CRISIS
This project is strategy aiming to improve the survival of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia in advanced phase and myeloid blast crisis.

The basis of this strategy is to add the demethylating agent 5-Azacitidine to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor ponatinib and evaluate its activity in 2 cohorts of patients with either chronic myelogenous leukemia in advanced phase or myeloid blast crisis.
CHRONIC MYELOGENOUS LEUKAEMIA IN ACCELERATED PHASE|CHRONIC MYELOGENOUS LEUKAEMIA IN MYELOID BLAST CRISIS
