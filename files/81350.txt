Study of SYS6020 in BCMA-positive Multiple Myeloma
This is a multi-center, phase I trial that studies the efficacy and recommended dose of BCMA CART cells in treating patients with BCMA-positive multiple myeloma (MM) that have not respond or relapsed after chemotherapy. B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), a cell surface protein expressed on malignant plasma cell, has emerged as a very selective antigen to be targeted in novel immunotherapy for MM.
