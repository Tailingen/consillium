A Study of Clofarabine in Older Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) for Whom Chemotherapy Is Not Suitable
The purpose of the study is to determine if treatment of older patients indicated with untreated Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) who are not considered to be suitable for intensive chemotherapy, can effectively be treated with Clofarabine.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: clofarabine
Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR rate was defined as the sum of the number of participants in the study population with complete remission (CR), complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi), or partial remission (PR) divided by the total number of participants in the study population.

ORR rate was determined by assessment of morphology and blast count from bone marrow aspirates and peripheral blood performed prior to first dose and at the end of clofarabine treatment. The ORR was determined at the end of each cycle of clofarabine, and assessed using the participant's best response to clofarabine treatment., At month 20
Rate of Response (Complete, Complete With Incomplete Blood Count Recovery, Partial), Response was determined by assessment of morphology and blast count from bone marrow aspirates and peripheral blood performed prior to first dose and at the end of clofarabine treatment.

Response was determined at the end of each cycle of clofarabine, and assessed using the participant's best response to clofarabine treatment., At month 20|Duration of Overall Response, Duration was calculated by Kaplan-Meier estimates, From 20 months up to 48 months|Overall Survival, Calculated by Kaplan-Meier estimates, From 20 months up to 48 months|Duration of Complete Remission, Duration was calculated by Kaplan- Meier estimates, From 20 months up to 48 months
