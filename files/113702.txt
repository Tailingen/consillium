A First in Human, Dose Escalation Study of JAB-3068 （SHP2 Inhibitor） in Adult Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a phase 1, multi-center, dose escalation, open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary evidence of antitumor activity of JAB-3068 in adult patients with advanced solid.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer|Head and Neck Cancer|Esophageal Cancer|Other Metastatic Solid Tumors
DRUG: JAB-3068
Number of participants with dose limiting toxicities, Incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) in the dose escalation phase. A DLT is defined as an adverse event or abnormal laboratory value assessed as unrelated to disease, disease progression, inter-current illness, or concomitant medications that occurs within the first treatment cycle with JAB-3068., up to 28-day per cycle
Number of participants with adverse events, All patients participating in this study will be assessed for incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs, including changes in laboratory values, vital signs, electrocardiograms, cardiac imaging and ophthalmological assessments, Approximately 2 years|Area under the curve, Area under the plasma concentration time curve of JAB-3068, Approximately 2 years|Cmax, Highest observed plasma concentration of JAB-3068, Approximately 2 years|Tmax, Time of highest observed plasma concentration of JAB-3068, Approximately 2 years|T1/2, Half life of JAB-3068, Approximately 2 years|Objective response rate, ORR is defined as the proportion of participants with complete response or partial response (CR+PR), Approximately 2 years|Duration of response, DOR is defined as the time from the participant's initial objective response (CR or PR) to study drug therapy, to disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Approximately 2 years
pERK, On treatment versus baseline comparison of pharmacodynamic marker pERK (Phosphorylated form of Extracellular signal-regulated kinase) on newly obtained tumor biopsy samples by IHC., Approximately 2 years
This is a phase 1, multi-center, dose escalation, open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary evidence of antitumor activity of JAB-3068 in adult patients with advanced solid.
