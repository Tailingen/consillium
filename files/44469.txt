Celecoxib and Trastuzumab in Treating Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer
RATIONALE: Celecoxib may be effective in preventing the further development of cancer. Monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Combining trastuzumab with celecoxib may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining celecoxib and trastuzumab in treating women who have metastatic breast cancer that has not responded to previous trastuzumab.
Breast Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: trastuzumab|DRUG: celecoxib
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the efficacy of celecoxib and trastuzumab (Herceptin) in women with HER2/neu-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer that is refractory to prior trastuzumab.
* Determine the safety of celecoxib in these patients.

OUTLINE: At least 3 weeks after the last dose of prior chemotherapy, patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily. Patients continue or restart trastuzumab (Herceptin) IV over 30-90 minutes weekly or every 3 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study within approximately 9 months.
