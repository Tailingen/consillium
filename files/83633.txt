Pilot Trial of Resistant Starch in Stage I-III Colorectal Cancer Survivors
This phase II, randomized pilot trial studies the effect of the consumption of foods made with resistant starch compared to foods made with corn starch on biomarkers that may be related to colorectal cancer progression in stage I-III colorectal cancer survivors. Foods made with resistant starch may beneficially influence markers of inflammation, insulin resistance, and the composition of gut bacteria in colorectal cancer survivors.

OTHER: Dietary Intervention (resistant starch)|OTHER: Dietary Intervention (regular starch)|OTHER: Questionnaire Administration
Feasibility: Accrual, The accrual rate will be estimated with number of participants at full enrollment at 12 months., Up to 12 months|Feasibility: Adherence, The adherence endpoint pertains to adherence to the intervention and is defined as consuming 75% or more of study foods on 75% of days from baseline to 8 weeks., From start of intervention to ending intervention: up to 8 weeks|Feasibility: Retention, The retention endpoint is defined as at least 80% of enrolled participants providing blood and stool samples at the week 8 timepoint., From start of intervention to the 8-week timepoint
Variability of Biomarkers of Insulin Resistance and Inflammation (Adiponectin), Adiponectin was measured at baseline and week 8 (follow-up) and reported using descriptive statistics., Baseline to follow-up at week 8|Variability in Biomarkers of Insulin Resistance and Inflammation (C-reactive Protein, CRP), CRP was measured at baseline and week 8 (follow-up) and reported using descriptive statistics., Baseline to follow-up at week 8|Variability in Gut Microbial Communities From Human Stool Samples - ALPHA DIVERSITY AND GENERA, This measure assesses variability in gut microbial communities from human stool samples collected during the study by changes in alpha diversity and genera in response to the intervention. We will use multivariate and univeriate approaches to assess significant changes int he microbiome in response to the intervention., Baseline to follow-up at weeks 2 and 8|Variability in Gut Microbial Communities From Human Stool Samples -- BETA DIVERSITY, This measure assesses variability in gut microbial communities from human stool samples collected during the study by changes in global microbial community (beta diversity) in response to the intervention. We will use multivariate and univeriate approaches to assess significant changes in the microbiome in response to the intervention., Baseline to followup at weeks 2 and 8
Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

GROUP I (INTERVENTION GROUP): Participants eat a diet consisting of resistant starch foods daily for 8 weeks. Study provided foods are in addition to their own usual daily diet.

GROUP II (CONTROL GROUP): Participants eat a diet consisting of regular corn starch foods daily for 8 weeks. Study provided foods are in addition to their own usual daily diet.
