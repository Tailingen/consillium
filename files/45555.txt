Alpha Radiation Emitters Device for the Treatment of of Malignant Cutaneous Tumors
A unique approach for cancer treatment employing intratumoral diffusing alpha radiation emitter device for Malignant Cutaneous Tumors
Skin Cancer|Cutaneous Tumor|Cutaneous Metastasis
DEVICE: DaRT- Diffusing Alpha-emitters Radiation Therapy
The objective response rate to DaRT treatment, Assessment of tumor response rate using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (Version 1.1), up to 9-11 weeks
Tumor volume, Assessment of the reduction in tumor volume based on imaging tests, up to 9-11 weeks|DaRT seeds placement, Assessment of the DaRT seed placement by localization of the DaRT seed in the tumor using CT imaging, Day of DaRT insertion procedure|Change in quality of life as assessed by the Skindex-16 questionnaire, Assessment of patient reported health-related Quality of Life (QoL) outcomes using the Skindex-16 questionnaire, up to 9-11 weeks|Disease-Free Survival (DFS) rate, Assessment of Disease-Free Survival, up to 24 months|Change in quality of life as assessed by the Skin Cancer Index (SCI) questionnaire, Assessment of patient reported health-related Quality of Life (QoL) outcomes using the Skin Cancer Index (SCI) questionnaire., up to 9-11 weeks
Adverse Events, Assessment of the frequency, severity and causality of adverse events related and not related to the DaRT treatment. Adverse events will be assessed and graded according to Common Terminology and Criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) version 5.0., up to 24 months
This will be a prospective, open label, single arm, multi- center study, assessing the safety and effectiveness of diffusing alpha emitters radiation therapy (DaRT) delivered through radioactive seeds inserted into the tumor.

This approach combines the advantages of local intratumoral irradiation of the tumor, as used in conventional brachytherapy, with the power of the alpha radiation emitting atoms, that will be introduced in quantities considerably lower than radiation therapy already used in patients.

Cutaneous lesions with histopathological confirmation of malignancy will be treated using DaRT seeds.

Reduction in tumor size 9-11 weeks following DaRT insertion will be assessed. Safety will be assessed by the frequency, severity and causality of all Adverse Events (AE).
