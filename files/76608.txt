A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Afamelanotide in Patients With Xeroderma Pigmentosum (XP)
The CUV156 study will evaluate the safety of afamelanotide in XP-C patients, as well as the drug's ability to assist reparative processes following ultraviolet (UV) provoked DNA damage of the skin. It will assess whether SCENESSE® increases the amount of UV light needed to cause DNA damage of skin cells, as well as the extent of skin repair before and after treatment.
Xeroderma Pigmentosum
DRUG: Afamelanotide
Change in minimal erythema dose (MED)., MED is the lowest dose of UV light that causes reddening of the skin., From Baseline to Day 76.
Change in UV-induced DNA damage and repair capacity., Analysis of UV photoproducts and DNA repair mechanisms., From Baseline to Day 76.|Change in skin disease severity (A)., The higher the score, the more severe the disease., From Baseline to Day 238.|Change in skin disease severity (B)., The higher the score, the more severe the disease., From Baseline to Day 238.|Change in skin disease severity (C)., The higher the score, the more severe the disease., From Baseline to Day 238.|Change in dermal melanin density., Non-invasive quantitative skin reflectance measurement., From Baseline to Day 238.|Change in quality of life assessed by a disease specific tool (A), Higher scores represent worse health-related quality of life., From Baseline to Day 238.|Change in quality of life assessed by a validated global quality of life tool (B), Score calculated in impairment percentages, with higher numbers indicating greater impaired quality of life., From Baseline to Day 238.
