A Study of SKB264 in Combination with Pembrolizumab Versus Chemotherapy in Combination with Pembrolizumab As First-Line Treatment for PD-L1 Negative Patients with Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
The study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SKB264 in combination with pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy in combination with pembrolizumab in the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC with PD-L1 negative.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: SKB264|DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: pemetrexed|DRUG: carboplatin or cisplatin
Progression Free Survival (PFS) assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression per RECIST 1.1 based on BICR or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Randomization up to approximately 28 months
Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization until the date of death due to any cause., Randomization up to approximately 43 months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) assessed by Investigator, PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression per RECIST 1.1 based on investigator or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Randomization up to approximately 28 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of patients who achieve complete response(CR) or partial response (PR), as assessed by BICR/investigator per RECIST 1.1, Randomization up to approximately 28 months|Disease control rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of patients who achieve CR, PR or stable disease (SD), as assessed by BICR/ investigator per RECIST 1.1, Randomization up to approximately 28 months|Duration of Response (DoR), DoR is defined as the time from the date of first documented CR or PR until date of documented disease progression per RECIST 1.1, as assessed by BICR/investigator or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Randomization up to approximately 28 months|Time to Response (TTR), TTR is defined as the time from the date of randomization until the first documentation of CR or PR as assessed by BICR/investigator per RECIST 1.1., Randomization up to approximately 28 months
This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter, Phase 3 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SKB264 in combination with pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy in combination with pembrolizumab in the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC with PD-L1 negative.
