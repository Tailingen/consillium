A Trial of Apatinib and Adebrelimab in Combination With Chemotherapy in Patients With Unresectable ICC
The study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Apatinib and Adebrelimab in Combination With chemotherapy in patients with advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC)
Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma (Icc)
DRUG: Apatinib and Adebrelimab in Combination With chemotherapy
objective response rate (ORR), the objective response rate (ORR) of advanced ICC patients who progressed after standard treatment with Adebrelimab and apatinib plus GEMOX., 12 months
Adverse Events, Number of adverse events. Postoperative adverse events were graded based on CTCAE v5.0, from the first drug administration to within 30 days for the last Adebrelimab dose|progression free survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from the start of treatment to the date of first documentation of disease progression based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1), or date of death, whichever occurred first., up to 24 months|overall survival (OS), OS is the time interval from the start of treatment to death due to any reason or loss of follow-up, up to 24 months
We are conducting a clinical research study to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of a novel combination therapy for patients with advanced, unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). The study hypothesizes that combining three treatments, apatinib (an oral TKI selectively targeting VEGFR2) and adebrelimab (an immune checkpoint inhibitor) plus GEMOX chemotherapy (a standard chemotherapy regimen of gemcitabine and oxaliplatin), will significantly improve outcomes compared to traditional chemotherapy alone. The primary goal is to measure how many patients experience tumor response (objective response rate, ORR), with historical data suggesting a 16% response rate for chemotherapy alone, while this study aims to achieve a 40% response rate. Secondary goals include assessing how long patients live without cancer worsening (progression-free survival), overall survival, and monitoring side effects. The trial will enroll 38 participants across multiple hospitals, all of whom will receive the combination therapy for up to two years or until the cancer progresses or side effects become unmanageable. Researchers will also explore whether specific biological markers, such as tumor protein levels or genetic changes, predict better responses to the treatment. By testing this three-drug combination, the study seeks to provide a more effective and tolerable first-line option for a cancer type with limited treatment choices and poor survival rates.
