Efficacy of Statin Addition to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Protocols for Breast Cancer
Different modalities for breast cancer treatments have exhausting and distressing side effects and toxicities leading to decreased compliance. Thus, repurposing drugs with accepted safety profile and possible antitumor activity becomes an eminent constraint.

Statins have been reported to have possible advantages as anticancer, and control of cancer progression. Moreover, they can sensitize cancer cells for radiotherapy. Therefore, the investigators aim to investigate the effect of (pitavastatin) added to conventional chemotherapy protocols for breast cancer patients.
