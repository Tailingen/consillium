Selinexor Plus High-Dose Melphalan (HDM) Before Autologous Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation for Multiple Myeloma
Phase I: The primary purpose of this study phase is to determine the best dose also referred to as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Selinexor when used in combination with high-dose melphalan as a conditioning regimen for hematopoietic cell transplant.

Phase II: The primary purpose of this study phase is to assess the complete response (CR) conversion rate.
