Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Chronic Phase Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia
RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a peptide may help the body build an effective immune response to kill cancer cells.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well vaccine therapy works in treating patients with chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia.
Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: bcr-abl peptide vaccine|GENETIC: reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction
Number of Participants With One-log Decrease in Circulation Breakpoint Cluster Region-Abelson Murine Leukemia(BCR-ABL) Transcripts That Persists for at Least Three Months During the 1-year Treatment Period., One-log decrease in circulating BCR-ABL transcripts (RT-PCR) that persists for at least three months during the 1-year treatment period., Every 3 months for the duration of the 1-year treatment period. .|Percentage of Patients Who Become RT-PCR-negative for BCR-ABL Transcripts, 12-24 Months|Comparison of Response in Patients With B3A2 Junctions vs B2A2 Junctions, 12-24 Months|Immunologic Response Over 1 Year, 12 months|Correlation of Response With Specific HLA Types, 12-24 Months
Safety of a Vaccine Containing Native and Synthetic Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) Peptides Over 1 Year Treatment., Weeks 2, 4, 6, 9, and monthly thereafter up to 2 years.
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the antileukemic effects of tumor-specific Breakpoint Cluster Region-Abelson Murine Leukemia(BCR-ABL) junction specific peptide vaccine, as measured by a decrease in circulating BCR-ABL transcripts by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), that persist for at least 3 months, in patients with chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia.
* Determine the percentage of patients treated with this vaccine who become RT-PCR-negative for BCR-ABL transcripts.
* Compare response in patients with B3A2 junctions vs B2A2 junctions when treated with this vaccine.
* Determine the immunologic response over 1 year in patients treated with this vaccine.
* Correlate response with specific HLA types in these patients.
* Determine the safety of this vaccine in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a pilot, multicenter study.

Patients receive BCR-ABL junction-specific peptide vaccine subcutaneously in weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 11 and then once monthly for 10 months.

BCR-ABL transcript levels are assessed by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction at baseline, weeks 2, 4, and 6, every 3 months during treatment, and then 2 weeks after completion of study treatment.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
