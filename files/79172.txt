Teclistamab or Talquetamab in Combination With Daratumumab for High-Risk Smoldering Myeloma (REVIVE Study)
The purpose of this study is to see whether combination treatment of Teclistamab and Daratumumab (Tel-Dara) or combination Talquetamab and Daratumumab (Tal-Dara) will delay the onset of multiple myeloma.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Teclistamab|DRUG: Talquetamab|DRUG: Daratumumab SC
Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Negative as Measured by Flow Cytometry, MRD negative (10\^-5 sensitivity by flow cytometry) as best response by completion of 12 cycles. MRD negative result means no disease is detected after treatment. Status of MRD will be assessed using International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Consensus Criteria for Response and Minimal Residual Disease Assessment in Multiple Myeloma, per discretion of treating physician., 12 months
Number of Treatment Related Adverse Events, The number of treatment related serious adverse events (SAEs) and grade 3 or higher adverse events (AEs) in participants receiving protocol therapy will be assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) Version 5, per physician discretion., Up to 25 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR), Overall response rate (ORR) is determined by the number of participants achieving stringent complete response (sCR), complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), or partial response (PR) to protocol therapy. Response will be assessed using standard International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Criteria for Response in Multiple Myeloma, per physician discretion., Up to 24 months|Duration of Response (DoR), The duration of response (DoR) is measured as the time from when participants meet the criteria for stringent complete response (sCR), complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), or partial response (PR) to protocol therapy using International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Criteria until the time progressive disease (PD) is documented, per discretion of treating physician., Up to 24 months|Best Objective Responses (BoR), The rate of best objective responses (BoR) is determined by the number of participants who achieve stringent complete response (sCR), complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), or partial response (PR) as their best response to protocol therapy using International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Criteria, per discretion of treating physician., Up to 24 months|Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Negativity Rate by Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), The rate of minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity by next-generation sequencing (NGS) after 24 cycles of the protocol therapy is determined by the number of participants who achieve MRD negativity by 10\^-6 sensitivity NGS, per discretion of treating physician., Up to 24 months|Sustained MRD Negativity, Sustained MRD negativity is determined by the number of participants who achieve MRD negativity 1, 2, and, 4 years apart, without any positive MRD in between, per discretion of treating physician., Up to 7 years|Duration of MRD Negativity, The duration of MRD negativity is measured as the time from the first time participants achieve MRD negativity until the participant has relapsed from MRD negativity, per discretion of treating physician., Up to 7 years|Clinical progression-free survival (clinPFS), Clinical progression-free survival (clinPFS) is measured as the time from the participants start of protocol therapy to the clinical development of symptomatic multiple myeloma or death, per discretion of treating physician., Up to 7 years|Biochemical progression-free survival (bioPFS), Biochemical progression-free survival (bioPFS) is measured as the time from the participants start of protocol therapy to progression of multiple myeloma in the blood or death occurs, using International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Criteria, per discretion of treating physician., Up to 7 years|Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS) is determined by the amount of time from participants start of protocol therapy to death or to last known timepoint the participant was alive., Up to 7 years|Serum Concentrations of Teclistamab and Talquetamab, Serum samples will be analyzed to determine concentrations of Teclistamab and Talquetamab using validated, specific, and sensitive methods., Up to 7 years|Pharmacokinetics of Teclistamab in multiple myeloma (MM), Serum from venous blood samples will be collected for measurement of serum concentrations of Teclistamab (Cohort A - Teclistamab only) and the generation of Anti-drug Antibodies (ADAs) where applicable to Teclistamab per the Study Schedule., Up to 7 years
The purpose of this study is to see whether combination treatment of Teclistamab and Daratumumab (Tel-Dara) or combination Talquetamab and Daratumumab (Tal-Dara) will delay the onset of multiple myeloma.
