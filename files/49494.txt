CP-675,206 in Combination With Short Term Androgen Deprivation in Patients With Stage D0 Prostate Cancer
The current protocol will evaluate the safety of combining treatment with bicalutamide(Casodex) and CP-675,206 (anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody) in patients with PSA-recurrent non-metastatic (stage D0) prostate cancer. This is a dose escalation study with safety the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints will be to determine whether prostate associated immune responses are seen, and whether treatment is associated with an increase in PSA doubling time and PSA recurrence at one year, as markers of clinical activity. Cohorts of six patients will be treated in each dose level. The investigators hypothesize that short-term androgen deprivation therapy will elicit prostate cancer-associated T-cell mediated tissue destruction that can be augmented with a monoclonal antibody blocking CTLA-4, and that this will have therapeutic benefit in patients with recurrent prostate cancer.

The Number of Participants With an Increase in PSA Doubling Time, Up to 18 months after last dose of study agent|Number of Participants With PSA Recurrence., PSA recurrence is defined as a minimum PSA value of greater or equal to 1.0ng/ml occurring within one year after the last treatment with CP-675,206, with a confirmatory PSA blood teat performed at least 2 weeks later., one year
This is an open label, single-center Phase I study. All subjects will receive bicalutamide 150mg orally days 1-28. Subjects will receive CP-675,206 IV over one hour on day 29. Doses will range from 6 mg/kg to 15 mg/kg. This cycle will be repeated once at month 3. Once the maximum tolerated dose has been determined, up to 6 additional subjects will be enrolled.
