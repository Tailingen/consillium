Bendamustine as Second-Line Therapy in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Small Cell Lung Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as bendamustine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well bendamustine works as second- or third-line therapy in treating patients with relapsed or refractory small cell lung cancer.
Lung Cancer
DRUG: bendamustine hydrochloride
Time to Progression, Estimated probable duration from on-study date to date of disease progression, using the Kaplan-Meier method with censoring (see analysis population description for additional details). Disease progression is defined under RECIST v1.1 as \>=20% increase in sum of longest diameters of target lesions, unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, or appearance of new lesions., On-study to date of progression, measured following cycle 2, 4, and 6 of a 21-day cycle for 6 cycles, (during 126 days)
Number of Patients With Each Worst-grade Toxicity, Number of patients with worst-grade toxicity at each of five grades following NCI Common Toxicity Criteria with grade 1 = mild, grade 2 = moderate, grade 3 = severe, grade 4 = life-threatening/disabling, 5 = death., Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for 6 cycles and at 30 days after end of treatment, at 156 days|Best Response, Number of patients in each response category, per RECIST v1.1, summarized as follows for target lesion criteria (see RECIST v1.1 for additional details):

complete response (CR),disappearance of target lesions; partial response (PR), \>=30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; progressive disease (PD), \>=20% increase in sum of LD of target lesions or appearance of new lesions; stable disease (SD), insufficient change in target lesions or new lesions to qualify as either PD or SD. Patients are categorized according to the best response achieved prior to occurrence of progressive disease, where best response hierarchy is CR\>PR\>SD\>PD., On-treatment date to date of disease progression, following cycle 2, 4, and 6 of a 21-day cycle for 6 cycles, (assessed up to 126 days)|Progression-free Survival, Estimated probable duration of life without disease progression, from on-study date to earlier of progression date or date of death from any cause, using the Kaplan-Meier method with censoring (see analysis population description for additional details). Disease progression is defined under RECIST v1.1 as \>=20% increase in sum of longest diameters of target lesions, unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, or appearance of new lesions., On-study date to lesser of date of progression or date of death from any cause ,measured following cycle 2, 4, 6 of a 21-day cycle for 6 cycles, (assessed up to 126 days)|Overall Survival, Estimated probable duration of life from on-study date to date of death from any cause, using the Kaplan-Meier method with censoring (see analysis population description for additional details), On study to date of death from any cause or last date known alive, measured every 6-8 weeks from the end of treatment, up to 31 months
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To determine the time to progression in patients with relapsed or refractory small cell lung cancer treated with second- or third-line bendamustine.

Secondary

* To determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.
* To determine the response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive bendamustine IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 2. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6-8 weeks.
