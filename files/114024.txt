Efficacy and Accuracy of Combined Localization Versus Single Localization in Non-palpable Breast Cancer
The standard method for localizing non-palpable breast cancer is currently preoperative wire-guided localization, its positive margin rate still remains around 20-50%. This study aims to compare the accuracy and efficacy of wire vs. combined breast tissue markers in localizing non-palpable breast cancer.

positive margin rate, It is defined as the proportion of patients in whom in situ or invasive carcinoma is found in the cavity margins after the first resection, including intraoperative frozen-section analysis and postoperative formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded analysis, subject to postoperative analysis., up to 3 months
