Donor Peripheral Stem Cell Transplant in Treating Patients With Hematolymphoid Malignancies
This phase 1 trial studies the side effects and the best dose of donor CD8+ memory T-cells in treating patients with hematolymphoid malignancies. Giving low dose of chemotherapy before a donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It may also stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining cancer cells (graft-versus-cancer effects). Giving an infusion of the donor's T cells (donor lymphocyte infusion) after the transplant may help increase this effect

BIOLOGICAL: therapeutic allogeneic lymphocytes
Occurrence (individual listings and summary) of dose-limiting toxicities, 60 days following CD8+ memory T-cell infusion|Incidence of GVHD, Change from Baseline to 60 days following the CD8+ memory T-cell infusion
Disease response as assessed by complete remission, partial remission, stable disease, and progressive disease from radiographic and cellular or tissue samples, Measured 90 and 180 days following infusion, Change from baseline to 180 days following infusion|Incidence of donor-specific chimerism assessed by STR analysis, Measured monthly for 6 months, Change from baseline to 6 months
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the feasibility of purifying allogeneic CD8+ memory T-cells suitable for clinical application and to determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of these cells in patients with recurrent or refractory hematolymphoid malignancies following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT).

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine disease response, time to disease progression, event-free survival, and overall survival following treatment with allogeneic CD8+ memory T-cells.

II. To assess donor specific chimerism before and at designated time points after treatment with allogeneic CD8+ memory T-cells.

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

Patients undergo CD8+ memory T-cell infusion over 10 to 20 minutes.
