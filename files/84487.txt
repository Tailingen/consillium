Bridging Study to Eliminate Presence of MRD for Acute Leukemia Before HCT
This is a Phase 2 study designed for the purpose of estimating various parameters surrounding the efficacy of Clofarabine, Cyclophosphamide and Etoposide in eliminating minimal residual disease (MRD) in acute leukemia patients otherwise in remission and without causing significant delay of HCT due to treatment related toxicity.

A single course of "bridge" chemotherapy is given prior to the transplant procedure as an approach to improved disease-free survival in a patient group who historically has had inferior outcomes.
Leukemia, Acute Lymphoblastic|Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Clofarabine|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Etoposide
Minimal Residual Disease, A bone marrow evaluation to determine study response and remission status will be performed on study Day 30 or upon adequate blood count recovery (ANC \> 0.50 and platelet \> 50,000), whichever occurs first. If the marrow is hypocellular and without evidence of normal tri-lineage hematopoiesis the marrow should be repeated at Day 42., Day 30 or adequate blood recovery
Study entry is open to patients regardless of gender or ethnic background.

The intent of this study design is for all patients to receive and complete one course of therapy. Patients who exhibit signs of disease progression or experience an unacceptable toxicity will be discontinued from treatment.

There will be no dose delays or dose reductions of study drugs for hematologic toxicity during Consolidation "Bridging" therapy (Day 1 through Day 30); however, prolonged hematopoietic recovery or bone marrow aplasia during the first 42 days may meet a study stopping rule.
