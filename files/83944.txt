EBUS Guided Cryo Biopsy of Solitary Pulmonary Nodules
To proof the feasibility and safety of EBUS guided transbronchial cryo biopsies in peripheral lung lesions
Yield of Cryo Biopsy in Lung Cancer|Solitary Pulmonary Nodule
PROCEDURE: Cryo biopsy
Safety, Number of Participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety Detailed analysis of number of Pneumothoraces and number of bleeding complication, 24 h after intervention
Efficacy, Diagnostic yield of the different biopsy techniques in establishing a specific diagnosis of the lesion, 48 h after intervention
Solitary pulmonary nodule are a diagnostic dilemma. Nowadays not only the basic tissue diagnosis is necessary, molecular signals are state of the art. Therefore more tissue is necessary. With a cryoprobe the amount of tissue is increased compared to the classical forceps biopsy.

Until now, the use of the cryoprobe ismÂ´t show in peripheral lung tissue.
