An Open Label Prostate Cancer Study in Japanese Patients
The primary aim of study is to gain an initial assessment of safety and tolerability of AZD3514 in Japanese patients together with assessing Pharmacokinetics (PK) and gaining a preliminary assessment of anti-tumour action. In this study, AZD3514 will be administered to Japanese patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: AZD3514
To investigate the safety and tolerability of AZD3514 when given orally to Japanese patients with castration resistant prostate cancer, Number of participants with adverse events, All AEs will be collected throughout the study, from informed consent until 30 days after the end of study treatment. The total duration of this time frame can not be specified
To define the maximum tolerated dose, if possible, a lower biologically-effective dose(s) or maximum feasible dose of AZD3514, A DLT is defined as any toxicity not attributable to the disease or disease-related processes under investigation and considered to be related to AZD3514 therapy during the single dose period and the first 21 days of multiple dosing (ie, by study day 29), during the single dose period and the first 21 days of multiple dosing (ie, by study day 29)|To characterise the pharmacokinetics of AZD3514 after a single oral dose and at steady state after multiple oral doses, To characterise the pharmacokinetics of AZD3514 after a single oral dose and at steady state after multiple oral doses
