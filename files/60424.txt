A Pilot Study of Renal Hypothermia During Partial Nephrectomy
Renal hypothermia may preserve renal function in patients who require partial nephrectomy. In preparation for a definitive randomized controlled trial this pilot study will assess feasibility and variance data to be used for sample size estimation
Kidney Neoplasm
PROCEDURE: Hypothermia
measures of renal function uCrCl be performed for estimation of renal function, 3 months
Post-operative complication, 3 months
