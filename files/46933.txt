A Global Phase III Study of Rilvegostomig or Pembrolizumab Plus Chemotherapy for First-Line Treatment of Metastatic Squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
The purpose of ARTEMIDE-Lung02 is to assess the efficacy and safety of rilvegostomig in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy for the first-line (1L) treatment of patients with metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC) whose tumors express programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1).
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Rilvegostomig|DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Nab-paclitaxel
Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization until the date of death due to any cause., Up to approximately 5 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from randomization until radiological progression per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) or death due to any cause (in the absence of progression)., Up to approximately 5 years
Landmark overall survival (OS) rates, OS is defined as the time from randomization until the date of death due to any cause., Up to approximately 5 years|Landmark progression-free survival (PFS) rates, PFS is defined as the time from randomization until radiological progression per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) or death due to any cause (in the absence of progression)., Up to approximately 5 years|Time to second progression or death (PFS2), PFS2 is defined as the time from randomization until the earliest of the progression event (following the initial progression event), after the start of the first subsequent therapy, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. The date of the second progression will be recorded by the investigator in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) and defined according to local standard clinical practice., Up to approximately 5 years|Overall response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of participants who have a confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR), by using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1)., Up to approximately 5 years|Duration of response (DoR), DoR is defined as the time from the date of first documented response until the date of documented progression using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) or death due to any cause (in the absence of progression)., Up to approximately 5 years|Pharmacokinetic (PK) of rilvegostomig, Concentration of rilvegostomig in serum., Up to approximately 5 years|Immunogenicity of rilvegostomig, Presence of antidrug antibodies (ADAs), titer, and neutralizing antibodies for rilvegostomig., Up to approximately 5 years|Patient-reported physical functioning, Proportion of participants with maintained or improved physical functioning as measured by Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Physical Function - Short Form 8c - 7 day (PROMIS PF-SF 8c - 7 day) at each time point., Up to approximately 5 years|Patient-reported global health status (GHS)/quality of life (QoL), Time to deterioration (TTD) of GHS/QoL as measured by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Item Library 172 (EORTC IL172). TTD is defined as time from randomization to the date of first deterioration. Deterioration is defined as a worsening change from baseline that reaches a clinically meaningful change threshold., Up to approximately 5 years|Patient-reported lung cancer symptoms of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), Time to deterioration (TTD) in pulmonary symptoms as measured by the Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Symptom Assessment Questionnaire (NSCLC-SAQ).

TTD is defined as time from randomization to the date of first deterioration., Up to approximately 5 years
This is a Phase III, two-arm, randomized, double-blind, global, multicenter study assessing the efficacy and safety of rilvegostomig compared to pembrolizumab, both in combination with platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, as a first-line (1L) treatment for patients with squamous metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC) whose tumors express PD-L1 (tumor cells (TC) â‰¥ 1%).
