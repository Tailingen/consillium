Study of Amiodarone Given Before Lung Surgery to Prevent Atrial Fibrillation After Lung Resection
Atrial fibrillation is a very common complication of pulmonary resection. Patients who develop atrial fibrillation require additional treatment and are more likely to stay in the hospital for longer period of time increasing the costs associated with the operation. We propose a randomized controlled trial to see if oral amiodarone given for one week before surgery can prevent atrial fibrillation after pulmonary resection. We plan to evaluate the incidence of atrial fibrillation in patients who received preoperative amiodarone and compare them to the incidence of atrial fibrillation in patients who did not received preoperative amiodarone.
