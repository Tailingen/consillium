A Pilot Study to Assess the Follow-up of Prostate Cancer Patients Who Have Undergone Radiotherapy Treatment
This is a pilot study assessing the role of the general practitioner in performing follow-up reviews on men who have recently completed radical radiotherapy for prostate cancer. This will be measured primarily by assessing any changes to the patient's health-related quality of life which will be evaluated by the completion of questionnaires by the participant at each review visit. The study aims to confirm that patient outcome is identical, independent of whether follow-up is performed by a specialist or the patient's General Practitioner.
