The grade of Pillsbury acne grading system ranges from 0 to 4. The high-scored grade means the more severe acne (i.e., grade 0 is considered to be normal, and grade 4 is considered severe)., Baseline, post-intervention (16 weeks), follow-up (32 weeks)|Change in quality of life evaluated by the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), SF-36 is a 36-item, patient-reported survey of patient health, which consists of eight sections. The score of SF36 ranges from 0 to 100. The higher the score, the less disability, i.e., a score of 0 is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability., Baseline, post-intervention (16 weeks), follow-up (32 weeks)|Adverse events, All expected or unexpected adverse events in both groups will be measured at every study visit.

A total of 60 subjects will be recruited and randomly allocated into experimental or control group with 30 subjects respectively. The subjects in experimental group will receive a standardized acupuncture treatment plus usual care, whereas the ones in control group will be managed only with usual care.
