A Study of BMS-986484 Alone and Combination Therapy in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of BMS-986484 administered alone, in combination with nivolumab in participants with advanced/metastatic solid tumors including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal carcinoma (CRC), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), gastric/gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (G/GEJC), and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN).
