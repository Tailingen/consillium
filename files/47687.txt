Interstitial Photodynamic Therapy Following Palliative Radiotherapy in Treating Patients With Inoperable Malignant Central Airway Obstruction
This phase I/II trial studies the side effects of interstitial photodynamic therapy following palliative radiotherapy and how well it works in treating patients with inoperable malignant central airway obstruction. Patients who have advanced stage cancer tumors in the lung can often have the breathing passages to the lung partially or completely blocked. These tumors could be due to lung cancer or other cancers (e.g., renal, breast, kidney, etc.) that spread to the lung. This blockage puts the patient at a higher risk for respiratory failure, post-obstructive pneumonia, and prolonged hospitalizations. Treatment for these patients may include bronchoscopic intervention (such as mechanical removal, stenting, laser cauterization, or ballooning), radiation therapy with and without chemotherapy. While palliative x-ray radiotherapy may help in shrinking the tumor, high dose curative radiotherapy that can ablate (a localized, nonsurgical destruction) the tumor also has high risk to cause significant toxicity, including bleeding, abnormal connections or passageways between organs or vessels and abnormal scar tissue that can also produce airway obstruction. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is another possible treatment that can provide local control of the tumor. PDT consists of injecting a light sensitive drug (photosensitizer, PS) into the vein, waiting for the PS to accumulate in the tumor, and then activating it with a red laser light. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays, particles, or radioactive seeds to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Giving interstitial photodynamic therapy following palliative radiotherapy may improve tumor response and survival without the serious side effects that are associated with the typical high dose curative x-ray radiotherapy alone in patients with malignant central airway obstruction.

Overall tumor response (Phase I), Will be assessed by CR or PR defined by the RECIST v 1.1 criteria., At 12 weeks post I-PDT|Quality of life (Phase I and II), Will be monitored using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung. This 36 item self-reported quality of life questionnaire measures responses across six domains: physical well-being, social/family well-being, relationship with doctor, emotional well-being, functional well-being, and additional concerns. This scale was chosen because multiple studies support its validity and use in clinical trials of lung cancer., At study enrollment, immediately prior to p-XRT and I-PDT, and at 4 and 12 weeks|Functional lung capacity (Phase I and II), Will be measured with the six-minute walk test., At study entry (baseline), 30 days and 12 weeks|Change in the therapeutic laser light transmission (Phase I and II), Will be measured with our light dosimetry system., During the I-PDT|Association between immune markers and tumor response (Phase I and II), will be measured with flow cytometry in fresh blood samples collected prior and 30 days after the I-PDT., Prior and 30 days after the I-PDT|Progression free survival (Phase I and II), Will be summarized using standard Kaplan-Meier methods., Time from date of study treatment to the time of first observed disease progression (RECIST 1.1 criteria) at the treated tumor site or, death due to any cause, assessed up to 5 years
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To test the safety of our image-based treatment planning for image-guided interstitial photodynamic therapy (I PDT) with endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) following standard of care palliative radiotherapy (p-XRT). (Phase I)

-To assess the efficacy of our image-based treatment planning for image-guided I-PDT following standard of care p-XRT. (Phase II)

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

* To assess objective tumor response. (Phase I)
* To evaluate changes in quality of life. (Phase I and II)
* To measure changes in functional lung capacity. (Phase I and II)
* To measure the relationship between the measured objective tumor response (at 12 +/- 2 weeks post I-PDT) and changes in therapeutic laser light transmission within the target tumor, as a future dosimetric marker for response. (Phase I and II)
* To assess treatment effects on the immune contexture. (Phase I and II)
* To monitor progression free survival. (Phase I and II)

OUTLINE: This is a phase I study, followed by a phase II.

PHASE I: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.

COHORT 1: Patients receive visudyne intravenously (IV) over 10 minutes and then undergo I-PDT with EBUS 60-90 minutes after visudyne for up to 3 treatment sessions. Patients undergo blood and tissue sample collection on study. Patients also undergo computed tomography (CT) throughout the trial.

COHORT 2: Patients undergo SOC p-XRT over a single fraction. Patients receive visudyne IV over 10 minutes and then undergo I-PDT with EBUS 60-90 minutes after visudyne for up to 2 treatment sessions at least 12 weeks apart. Patients undergo blood and tissue sample collection on study. Patients also undergo CT throughout the trial.

PHASE II: Patients undergo SOC p-XRT over a single fraction. Patients receive visudyne IV over 10 minutes and then undergo I-PDT with EBUS 60-90 minutes after visudyne for up to 2 treatment sessions at least 12 weeks apart. Patients undergo blood and tissue sample collection on study. Patients also undergo CT throughout the trial.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and 8, 12, and 24 weeks.
