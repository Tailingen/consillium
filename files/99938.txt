Study Evaluating 111In-Panitumumab for Nodal Staging in Head and Neck Cancer
The primary purpose of the study is to assess the safety of 111In-panitumumab as a molecular imaging agent in patients with Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma.

The secondary objective is to compare sensitivity and specificity of identifying sentinel lymph nodes by systemic injection of 111In-panitumumab prior to Day of Surgery versus conventional local injection with an optical dye at the time of surgery.
Head and Neck Cancer
DRUG: 111I-n panitumumab|PROCEDURE: Single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) scans
Assess the safety of 111In panitumumab as a molecular imaging agent in patients with HNSCC., Number of CTCAE v5.0 Grade 2 or higher adverse events by Day 15 determined that are significant, definitely or probably related to 111In panitumumab. Safety data will be summarized by grade, severity, and type., 15 days
Compare sensitivity of systemic 111In panitumumab versus conventional local optical dye, Sensitivity of systemic 111In panitumumab of identifying sentinel lymph nodes versus sensitivity of conventional local optical dye in identifying sentinel lymph nodes using histopathology will be compared, 10 days after surgery|Compare specificity of systemic 111In panitumumab versus conventional local optical dye, Specificity of systemic 111In panitumumab of identifying sentinel lymph nodes versus specificity of conventional local optical dye in identifying sentinel lymph nodes using histopathology will be compared, 10 days after surgery
