3D1002 in Combination With Oxycodone Hydrochloride Sustained-release Tablets in Patients With Moderate to Severe Cancer Pain
This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 3D1002 alone or in combination with oxycodone hydrochloride sustained-release tablets (OxyContin) for the management of moderate or severe cancer pain.
Cancer Pain
DRUG: 3D1002 (50 mg)(Phase IIa)|DRUG: 3D1002 (100 mg)(Phase IIa)|DRUG: 3D1002 (150 mg)(Phase IIa)|DRUG: 3D1002 monotherapy (Phase IIb)|DRUG: OxyContin monotherapy (Phase IIb)|DRUG: 3D1002 + OxyContin (Phase IIb)
Sum of pain intensity difference in the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) within 14 days after the first study drug treatment (SPID14), ①Average pain intensity is calculated daily for the past 24 hours using the NRS (0 = No pain, 10 = Worst pain imaginable). ②PID (pain intensity difference): Baseline pain intensity score (for the day prior to the day of randomization) minus pain intensity score at each given day.③SPID: the sum of the pain intensity difference generated daily from day 1 to the designated day., 1 to 14 days after receiving study treatment
Proportion of subjects who achieve effective pain control, Effective pain control: mean NRS score within 0-3 points and episode of breakthrough pain ≤ 2 times in 24 hours, 1 to 14 days after receiving study treatment|Time to achieve effective pain control, 1 to 14 days after receiving study treatment|Time-specific pain intensity difference（PID）, 1 to 14 days after receiving study treatment|Sum of pain intensity difference (SPID) in the NRS within 3,5 and 7 days post-treatment, from day 1 to 3, 5 and 7 after receiving study treatment, respectively|Time-specific subject self-rated pain relief based on Brief Pain Inventory Short Form (BPI-SF) Questionnaire Item 8, The pain relief is assessed daily for the past 24 hours based on the percentage of relief from baseline, ranging from 0 (no relief) to 100% (complete relief)., 1 to 14 days after receiving study treatment|Sum of subject self-rated pain relief based on BPI-SF Questionnaire Item 8 within 3,5,7 and 14 days post-treatment, from day 1 to 3, 5, 7 and 14 after receiving study treatment, respectively|Proportion of subjects with pain response over 7 and 14 days after treatment, Pain response: at least 30% and 50% decrease in pain intensity NRS score from baseline., 1 to 14 days after receiving study treatment|Time to pain response, 1 to 14 days after receiving study treatment|The number of breakthrough pain episodes and rescue dose of immediate-release oxycodone over 7 and 14 days after treatment;, 1 to 14 days after receiving study treatment|Time-specific oxycodone dose, including immediate-release oxycodone capsules and sustained-release oxycodone tablets (the latter is only applicable for phaseⅡb), 1 to 14 days after receiving study treatment|Total dose of oxycodone over 3, 7, and 14 days post-treatment, 1 to 14 days after receiving study treatment|Evaluation of the subjects' quality of life over 7 and 14 days after treatment by using of European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30 V3.0) (for phase Ⅱb only), EORTC QLQ-C30 comprises 30 items, including five functioning scales, a global quality of life (QoL) scale, three symptom scales and six single items. For the functioning and the global QoL scales, a higher score denotes better health. For the symptom scales and single-item scales, a higher score indicates more symptom burden., 1 to 14 days after receiving study treatment|Patient's global impression of change (PGI-C) over 7 and 14 days after treatment (for phase IIb only), PGI-C is a participant rated instrument to measure participant's change in overall status of general condition including pain on a 7-point scale, with 1 being "very much improved" and 7 being "very much worse"., 1 to 14 days after receiving study treatment|Frequency and severity of adverse events during treatment, 1 to 14 days after receiving study treatment
The investigational product in this study, 3D1002, is a selective antagonist of prostaglandin E2 receptor subtype 4 (EP4). The study is composed of two stages. Phase IIa stage is to assess the safety and efficacy of 3D1002 administered at doses of 50, 100 or 150 mg every 12 hour (q12h) for patients with moderate to severe cancer pain, and to determine the optimal recommended dose for further studies. Phase IIb stage is to evaluate the difference in the efficacy and safety of 3D1002 combined with OxyContin and OxyContin alone in treatment of patients with moderate to severe cancer pain.
