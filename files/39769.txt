SHR-1701 in Subjects With Metastatic or Locally Advanced Solid Tumors
The main purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of SHR-1701 at different dose levels. Study consists of dose-escalation part and an expansion part in subjects with metastatic or locally advanced solid tumors.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: SHR-1701
Dose escalation part： Safety and tolerability of SHR-1701 in advanced malignancies., Number of Subjects who occurs dose-limiting toxicity (DLTs)., Up to 3/4 weeks.|Clinical expansion Part: Objective Response Rate（ORR）, ORR is define as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who havea Complete Response(CR:Disappearance of all target lesions)or a Partial Response(PR :30% decrease in the sum of diameter of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1., Up to 6 weeks
Clinical expansion Part: Safety of SHR-1701, Number of subjects who occurs treatment-related Adverse Events(AEs）, Up to 4 weeks after last treatment|Clinical expansion Part: Disease Control Rate(DCR) per RECIST1.1, DCR is define as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who have a CR,PR or SD per RECIST 1.1., Up to 6 weeks|Clinical expansion Part: Duration of Response （DOR）per RECIST1.1, DOR is define as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until disease progression per RECIST 1.1, Up to 6 weeks|Clinical expansion Part:Progression-free survival(PFS) per RECIST1.1, PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression per RECIST 1.1, 12months (anticipated)
This is a Phase I, open-label, multiple-ascending dose trial. Study consists of dose-escalation part in subjects with metastatic or locally advanced solid tumors, and expansion part with selected indications.
