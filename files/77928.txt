DRUG: SAR408701|DRUG: Docetaxel
Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first documentation of objective PD as assessed by radiological review committee (IRC) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) definitions or death due to any cause before the study cut-off date, whichever occurred first. PD was defined as unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions; appearance of 1 or more new lesions; at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeters (mm)., Tumor assessments performed at screening, and every 8 weeks +/-5 days thereafter, up to 189 weeks|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival was defined as the time from date of randomization to date of death due to any cause., From date of first study treatment administration (Day 1) until the date of death due to any cause, up to 189 weeks
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who had a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), as best overall response derived from overall response (OR) determined by the IRC per RECIST 1.1. CR was defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions, and normalization of tumor marker level. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have had reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., Tumor assessments performed at screening, and every 8 weeks +/-5 days thereafter, up to 189 weeks|Time to Deterioration (TTD) in Disease-related Symptoms as Determined by European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire and Lung Cancer-specific Module With 13 Items (EORTC QLQ LC-13), The TTD was defined as the time from baseline (Cycle 1, Day 1) until the first ≥10-point change from baseline up to the end of treatment assessment before the initiation of further anticancer therapy and the analysis cut-off date. For the TTD in disease-related symptoms (cough, dyspnea, pain) from EORTC QLQ LC-13, a deterioration was defined as an increase from baseline score of at least 10 points in any 1 of these 3 symptoms. The EORTC QLQ-LC13 (LC13) is the lung cancer module of the EORTC QLQ-C30 that assesses lung-cancer-associated symptoms (cough, dyspnea, pain, hemoptysis) and side-effects from conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy (sore mouth, hair loss, dysphagia and neuropathy). The EORTC QLQ-LC13 contains 13 items. Items on the LC13 were scored using the LC13 scoring algorithms which standardize the raw scores to a 0-100 range. Lower scores indicate lower symptomology/symptom burden (lower scores better)., Predose on Day 1 of Cycle 1, then on Day 1 of every 2 docetaxel Cycles, or every 3 tusamitamab ravtansine Cycles (i.e., every 6 weeks) up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug administration, up to 151 weeks|TTD in Physical Function as Determined by European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Cancer-specific Module With 30 Items (EORTC QLQ C30), TTD was defined as time from baseline(Cycle 1,Day 1) until first ≥10-point change from baseline up to end of treatment assessment before initiation of further anticancer therapy and analysis cut-off date.For TTD in physical function from EORTC QLQ-C30, deterioration=decrease of at least 10 points from baseline score.EORTC QLQ-C30(C30) is 30-item, cancer specific that includes global health status/health-related quality of life(GHS/QoL), functional scales(physical,role,emotional,cognitive,social), symptom scales(fatigue,nausea\&vomiting,pain), 5 symptom items(dyspnea,insomnia,appetite loss,constipation,diarrhea,perceived financial difficulties). Most questions from QLQ-C30 were rated on 4-point scale(1/Not at All to 4/Very Much), except Items 29-30,which comprise GHS scale and were rated on 7-point scale(1/Very Poor to 7/Excellent). All scales were transformed from raw scores to linear scales ranging 0-100. High score represented favorable outcome with best quality of life., Predose on Day 1 of Cycle 1, then on Day 1 of every 2 docetaxel Cycles, or every 3 tusamitamab ravtansine Cycles (i.e., every 6 weeks) up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug administration, up to 151 weeks|TTD in Role Function Measured by EORTC QLQ C30, TTD was defined as time from baseline (Cycle 1, Day 1) until first ≥10-point change from baseline up to end of treatment assessment before initiation of further anticancer therapy and analysis cut-off date. For TTD in role function from EORTC QLQ-C30, deterioration = decrease of at least 10 points from baseline score. EORTC QLQ-C30 (C30) is a 30-item, cancer specific that includes GHS/QoL, functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, social), symptom scales (fatigue, nausea \& vomiting, pain), 5 symptom items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, perceived financial difficulties item). Most questions from QLQ-C30 were rated on a 4-point scale (1/Not at All to 4/Very Much), except Items 29-30, which comprise GHS scale and were rated on a 7-point scale (1/Very Poor to 7/Excellent). All scales were transformed from raw scores to linear scales ranging 0 to 100. A high score represented a favorable outcome with a best quality of life for participant., Predose on Day 1 of Cycle 1, then on Day 1 of every 2 docetaxel Cycles, or every 3 tusamitamab ravtansine Cycles (i.e., every 6 weeks) up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug administration, up to 151 weeks|Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Treatment-emergent Serious Adverse Events (TESAEs), An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. A SAE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose resulted in death, was life-threatening, required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent disability/incapacity, was a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or was an important medical event. TEAEs were defined as AEs that developed, worsened, or became serious during the treatment period., From date of first study treatment administration (Day 1) up to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment administration, up to 151 weeks|Number of Participants With Potentially Clinically Significant Abnormalities (PCSA) in Hematology Parameters, Blood samples were collected to determine the abnormalities in hematology parameters., From date of first study treatment administration (Day 1) up to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment administration, up to 151 weeks|Number of Participants With PCSA in Clinical Chemistry, Blood samples were collected to determine the clinical chemistry laboratory abnormalities., From date of first study treatment administration (Day 1) up to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment administration, up to 151 weeks|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR was defined as the time from the date of first initial occurrence of a CR or PR to the date of first documentation of objective PD according to RECIST 1.1 before the initiation of any posttreatment anticancer therapy or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. CR was defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions, and normalization of tumor marker level. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have had reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. PD was defined as unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions; appearance of 1 or more new lesions; at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm., Tumor assessments performed at screening, and every 8 weeks +/-5 days thereafter, up to 189 weeks
The median expected duration of study per participant was estimated as median 9 months in docetaxel arm (1 month for screening, 4 months for treatment, and 4 months for the EOT and follow-up visits) and 12.5 months in SAR408701 arm (1 month for screening, 6.5 months for treatment, and 5 months for end of treatment follow-up).
