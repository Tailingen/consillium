DRUG: Pacritinib
Rate of dose limiting toxicities (DLT), Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) rate during the 1st cycle (28 days) of pacritinib., At 28 days
The proportion of patients that respond to treatment, Overall response rate (ORR), defined as best disease response recorded from first day of treatment until disease progression or initiation of new antineoplastic therapy.

Responses for patients with NHL or small lymphocytic lymphoma will be performed in accordance with the Revised Lugano classification staging system for non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. Responses for patients with CLL will be evaluated in accordance with criteria of the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, with the exception that lymphocytosis will not be the sole criteria for disease progression. Responses for CTCL will be assessed by the modified Severity Weighted Assessment Tool, response in blood, nodes, viscera, and the global composite scoring system., Up to 2 years|The proportion of patients that experience a complete response (CR), Responses for patients with NHL or small lymphocytic lymphoma will be performed in accordance with the Revised Lugano classification staging system for non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.
