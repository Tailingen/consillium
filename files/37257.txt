PPX and Concurrent Radiation for Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Without MGMT Methylation
To obtain preliminary data in a randomized phase II study whether PPX/RT improves progression-free survival as compared to temozolomide/RT for patients with GBM without MGMT methylation.
Glioblastoma Multiforme
DRUG: PPX (CT2103)|DRUG: Temozolomide
Progression Free Survival PPX/RT Versus TMZ/RT for Patients With GBM Without Methylation, MRI response evaluated by RANO criteria

* Complete Response (CR): Circumstance when the enhancing tumor is no longer seen by neuroimaging, with the patient off all steroids or on adrenal maintenance only; CR will be coded only if confirmed by a second CT/MR scan performed a minimum of 4 weeks after the initial scan coding a response.
* Partial Response (PR): Decrease of \> 50% in the product of two diameters. Patients should be receiving stable or decreasing doses of steroids. PR will be coded only if confirmed by a second CT/MR scan performed a minimum of 4 weeks after the initial scan.
* Progression (P): A \> 25% increase in tumor area (two diameters) provided that the patient has not had his/her dose of steroids decreased since the last evaluation period. This will not need a confirmatory scan. A concomitant decrease in steroid dose will rule out a progression designation during the first 2 months after completion of XRT., Q 3 months on study then Q3 months in f/u for yr 1, q 4 months yr 2, q 6 months for approximately 4 ys.
To evaluate the toxicities of PPX/RT To evaluate neuro-cognitive functional assessments of patients with GBM receiving PPX/RT To obtain preliminary data in a randomized phase II study whether PPX/RT improves overall survival as compared to temozolomide /RT for patients with GBM without MGMT methylation to facilitate planning a phase III study.
