Surgical Success After Laparoscopic vs Abdominal Hysterectomy
The purpose of the proposed pilot study is to investigate the effectiveness, cost, safety, and long-term impact on quality of life of laparoscopic hysterectomy (LH) in relation to abdominal hysterectomy (AH) for the treatment of benign gynecologic disease in women through a randomized surgical trial.

PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic hysterectomy|PROCEDURE: Abdominal hysterectomy
Quality of life, 1) Patient-centered outcomes composite

1. Quality of life - measured using the Short Form 12 (SF-12v2),
2. Sexual functioning - measured using the Sexual Activity Questionnaire (SAQ)
3. Body image - measured using the Body Image Scale (BIS)
4. Return to normal activity -measured using the Activities Assessment Scale (AAS)
5. Pain - measured using a 10 point likert scale
6. Productivity - measured using a questionnaire about missed work, 1 year
Cost, Hospital charges and indirect costs of missed work/caregiving due to hysterectomy will be calculated, 1 year|Complications, Intraoperative and postoperative complications including conversions, unintentional lacerations/injury to organs, hemorrhage, infection, wound complications, VTE, death, pain, neuropathy, 1 year
The overall hypothesis is that neither mode of hysterectomy will be consistently superior to the other with respect to each of the three domains of complications, cost, and patient-centered outcomes. The overall goal of the study is to determine which clinically relevant factors may impact the choice of LH compared to AH. The results of the study may be useful for clinicians, patients, hospital administrators and health policy makers.
