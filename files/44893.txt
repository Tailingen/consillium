Study of DPD for Predicting Efficacy and Safety to S-1 Plus Oxaliplatin in Gastrointestinal Cancer
In this study, the relationship between DPD and the effects of S-1 combined with oxaliplatin chemotherapy were investigated in 200 patients with gastrointestinal carcinoma.
Gastrointestinal Cancer
DRUG: S-1 plus oxaliplatin
Objective tumor response, Tumor response was evaluated by RECIST 1.1. The relationship between DPD activity and the objective tumor response will be evaluated by Cox's proportional hazards regression model., Every eight weeks
Overall survival, The relationship between DPD activity and the overall survival will be evaluated by Cox's proportional hazards regression model., Three year|Progress-free survival, The relationship between DPD activity and the PFS will be evaluated by Cox's proportional hazards regression model., one year|Adverse event incidence, The relationship between DPD activity and the drug-related toxicity incidence will be evaluated by Cox's proportional hazards regression model., One year
A new oral DPD inhibitory fluoropyrimidine (DIF), S-1, is reportedly effective against gastrointestinal carcinoma. In this study, the relationship between activity of DPD in peripheral blood and the effects of chemotherapy were investigated in 200 patients treated with first-line S-1 combined with platinum chemotherapy for gastrointestinal carcinoma.
