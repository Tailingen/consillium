A Phase I Study of BAY3498264 Given Together With Sotorasib in Participants Who Have Advanced Solid Cancers With Specific Genetic Changes Called KRASG12C Mutation
Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have advanced solid cancers with a KRASG12C mutation.

Sotorasib is a drug that targets cancer cells which contain mutated KRASG12C protein; it can stop the cancer cells from growing and can lead to their death. Sotorasib is already approved to be used by doctors. However, when sotorasib works, it normally only works for a period of time, after which the cancer starts to grow again, and the patient may need a different treatment.

BAY3498264 is a drug that is currently under development. It is expected to prevent the activity of a protein called son of sevenless 1 (SOS1). The SOS1 protein works together with KRAS; by blocking the activity of SOS1 with BAY3498264, it is hoped that the benefit offered by treatment with sotorasib may be increased - for example, resulting in a longer or deeper response.

The main purpose of this first-in-human study is to learn how safe BAY3498264 is when given together with sotorasib and what is the maximum dose of BAY3498264 that can be safely given to participants together with sotorasib.

During the study, participants will receive the following treatments:

* BAY3498264: participants will first receive BAY3498264 alone for seven days and then BAY3498264 in combination with sotorasib. These combination treatments will be given in cycles, each lasting 21 days.
* Sotorasib: participants will receive a standard, approved dose of Sotorasib once every day with BAY3498264.

The treatment will continue for as long as participants benefit from it without any severe medical problems or until they or their doctor decide to stop the treatment, or until their cancer starts to grow again despite the treatment (also called 'progression').

This study has 3 parts, the dose escalation part, the backfill part and the expansion part.

During the study, researchers will collect blood, urine, and take imaging scans like CT, PET, MRI, and X-rays, and examine the participants' heart health using an electrocardiogram (ECG). Participants' health is monitored throughout the study.
