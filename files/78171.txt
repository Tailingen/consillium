AVB-500 (Batiraxcept) in Combination With Paclitaxel in Recurrent High Grade Uterine Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine safety and tolerability of AVB-500 when given in combination with paclitaxel in patients with recurrent high-grade uterine cancer.
Recurrent High Grade Uterine Cancer
DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Batiraxcept
Frequency and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events, -Graded by CTCAE v.5., From start of treatment though 30 days after the last dose of AVB-500 (estimated to be 31 weeks)
Serum sAXL and GAS6 ratio, At baseline|Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters (including Cmax) as determined from AVB-500 serum levels, Cycle 1 Day 1 pre-infusion, Cycle 1 Day 1 post-infusion, Cycle 1 Day 15 pre-infusion, and subsequent cycles day 1 pre-infusions (each cycle is 21 days)|Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters (including Tmax) as determined from AVB-500 serum levels, Cycle 1 Day 1 pre-infusion, Cycle 1 Day 1 post-infusion, Cycle 1 Day 15 pre-infusion, and subsequent cycles day 1 pre-infusions (each cycle is 21 days)|Pharmacodynamic effects as determined by changes from baseline in serum GAS6 levels, Cycle 1 Day 1 pre-infusion, Cycle 1 Day 1 post-infusion, Cycle 1 Day 15 pre-infusion, and subsequent cycles day 1 pre-infusions (each cycle is 21 days)|Overall response rate (ORR), -Defined as the proportion of subjects who have a partial or complete response to therapy, Through completion of treatment (estimated to be 27 weeks)|Progression-free survival (PFS), -Defined as the time from start of treatment to the first radiologically documented disease progression, or death, whichever comes first. The alive patients without radiologically documented disease progression are censored at the last follow-up., Through completion of follow-up (estimated to be 5 years and 27 weeks)|Recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of AVB-500 in combination with paclitaxel, Through completion of cycle 1 (cycle=21 days) for all patients (estimated to be 48 months and 3 weeks)|Incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA), Day 1 of each cycle (cycle-21 days) and end of treatment (estimated to be 27 weeks)|Overall survival (OS), -Defined as the time from start of treatment to death. The alive patients are censored at the last follow-up., Through completion of follow-up (estimated to be 5 years and 27 weeks)
