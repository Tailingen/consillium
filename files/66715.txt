A Study of ASTX727 in People With Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors (MPNST)
The purpose of this study is to see whether the study drug ASTX727 is an effective treatment for people who have MPNST with a PCR2 mutation.

ASTX727 is a combination of two drugs (cedazuridine and decitabine) that have been designed to target cancer cells with a PCR2 mutation and to disrupt the cells' ability to survive and grow. The study researchers think that the study drug allows decitabine to work better than decitabine given alone.
