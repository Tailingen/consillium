SSTR PET/CT for Preoperative N Stage Evaluation in GEP-NETs
The research aims to prospectively include patients with GEP-NENs, undergo preoperative imaging assessment (including PET/CT and contrast-enhanced CT), and accurately delineate lymph node regions. Through postoperative pathological reports, the diagnostic performance of lymph node metastasis (LNM) in GEP-NENs is evaluated. Factors influencing the diagnostic accuracy of SSTR-PET/CT and contrast-enhanced CT are also investigated.
