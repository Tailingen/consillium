Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposomes in Combination With GDP in Relapsed/Refractory PTCL
This is a prospective, open-label, single arm, multicenter clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy mitoxantrone hydrochloride liposome in combination with gemcitabine, dexamethasone, and cisplatin in relapsed/refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma
Treatment|Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma

This is a prospective, open-label, single arm, multicenter clinical study to explore the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of liposomal mitoxantrone hydrochloride when combined with gemcitabine, dexamethasone, and cisplatin in patients with relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma. Liposomal mitoxantrone hydrochloride will be given on day 1 at three different doses (12 mg/m2，16 mg/m2, 20 mg/m2) and be combined with gemcitabine, dexamethasone, and cisplatin. The dose limited toxicity (DLT) will be evaluated after the first cycle of therapy. A maximum of 6 cycles of therapy are planned. An dose expansion study of mitoxantrone hydrochloride liposome at RP2D dose level combined with gemcitabine, dexamethasone, and cisplatin was conducted to explore the efficacy and safety tolerance of the combined regimen.
