Postoperative Bleeding Prevention in Massive Bone Tumour Resection
Massive bone tumour resection is often associated with important postoperative bleeding. This may determine systemic (anaemia), as well as local complications (wound healing, seroma, haematoma).

The objective of this study is to determine whether the use of topical tranexamic acid or topical Evicel® will reduce the perioperative bleeding comparing it with usual haemostasis.
