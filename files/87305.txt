Evaluating the Impact of 18F-FDG-PET-CT on Risk Stratification and Treatment Adaptation for Patients with Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer
Evaluate the impact of 18F-FDG-PET-CT on the staging of patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer. Based on the results of 2 18F-FDG-PET-CT's patients are stratified in non-metastatic, oligometastatic and polymetastatic bladder cancer patients and the treatment is adapted accordingly to improve overall survival.
Muscle-Invasive Bladder Carcinoma
RADIATION: Metastasis directed therapy (MDT)|DRUG: Immunotherapy|PROCEDURE: Standard of care
Overall survival, Defined as the time from diagnosis of MIBC to death from any cause, 2 years
The number of patients with acute toxicity, Assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0, 3 months|The number of patients with late toxicity, Assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0, 5 years|Progression-free survival, Defined as appearance of local/locoregional recurrence diagnosed at CT-scan or cystoscopy in case of TMT or appearance of metastasis diagnosed at MIBC or non-MIBC-related imaging., 5 years|Distant metastasis-free survival, Defined as time of diagnosis until occurrence of distant metastasis on repeated imaging., 5 years|Disease specific survival, Defined as time of diagnosis until death due to MIBC., 5 years|Patient reported quality of life as per EORTC-QLQ C30, Validated questionnaire assessing different health-related parameters (psychological, physical and social well-being) in cancer patients, 5 years|Patient reported quality of life as per EORTC-QLQ BLM30, Validated questionnaire assessing the health-related QOL of muscle invasive bladder cancer patients, 5 years|Sensitivity/specificity of 18F-FDG-PET-CT for the detection of extra-pelvic metastases, Sensitivity/specificity of 18F-FDG-PET-CT, 3 months|Validation of predictive biomarkers, A biopsy specimen of the bladder, obtained after transurethral resection of the bladder (TURb),as well as urine and blood samples will be collected for validation of predictive biomarkers by evaluating the correlation between response to therapy and outcome (PFS, DMFS, DSS and OS) with in literature reported biomarkers determined on biopsy specimen of the bladder, obtained after TURb., 5 years
