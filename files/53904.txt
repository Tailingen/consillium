Ensartinib in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Patients With Positive ALK
This study is aimed to determine the maximum tolerated dose of ensartinib, an oral ALK inhibitor in Chinese patients with ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer
Solid Tumor|Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Metastatic
DRUG: Ensartinib
Maximum Tolerated Dose, 12 months
Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax), To characterize the preliminary pharmacokinetics of single-agent ensartinib, 12 months|Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), To characterize the preliminary pharmacokinetics of single-agent ensartinib, 12 months|Half-life time, To characterize the preliminary pharmacokinetics of single-agent ensartinib, 12 months
The initial purpose of the study is to determine the largest amount of ensartinib that can be safely given to humans. An expansion phase will be conducted to assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity in ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer once the recommended Phase 2 dose has been established.
