Hypofractionated Brain Radiation In EGFR Mutated Adenocarcinoma Cranial Disease (Hybrid)
A multi-center phase III randomized controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of Hypofractionated SRS (HFSRS) along with EGFR-TKI in patients with brain metastasis from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Assuming that HFSRS is not inferior to EGFR-TKI concurrent with whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT), the primary end point is intracranial PFS (iPFS), while secondary outcomes included overall survival (OS), evaluation of cognitive function, quality of life (QoL) and adverse events.
Stage IV EGFR Mutated NSCL With Brain Metastases
DRUG: Gefitinib 250mg po qd or Tarceva 150mg po qd or Icotinib 125mg po tid Other Name: Gefitinib/Tarceva/Icotinib|RADIATION: WBRT|RADIATION: HFSRS
iPFS, intracranial progression-free survival, 18 months
cognitive function, Neurocognitive effects evaluated according to Mini-Mental Status Examination Evaluated according to Mini-Mental Status Examination, 18 month|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival, 18 months
WBRT remains to be standard of care for NSCL patients. Long term survival from WBRT may have noticeable cognitive dysfunction. The EGFR TKI has reasonable control for intracranial disease, but the duration of EGFR TKI control disease is variable due to tendency of drug resistance. To maintain intracranial disease control and improve cognitive function, the investigators propose using hypofractionated SRS in multiple brain metastases or large brain lesions alone with TKI.
