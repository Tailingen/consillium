Pharmacokinetics of Tivantinib in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors and Hepatic Impairment
This is a multi-center, open-label, Phase 1 study to evaluate the impact of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of Tivantinib in cancer subjects with varying degrees of hepatic function, from normal to severely impaired.

Composite of plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of Tivantinib, The following pharmacokinetic parameters will be determined: population estimates of apparent total clearance (CL/F), apparent volume of distribution (V/F), area under the concentration-time curve during the dosing interval (AUCtau), and maximum concentration (Cmax) during the dosing interval., 0 (predose), 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after a single dose and 0 (predose), 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, and 48 hours after Cycle 1 Day 11 dose
Composite of plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of Tivantinib, The following pharmacokinetic parameters will be determined: area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to the last quantifiable concentration (AUClast) and Cmax after single dose, time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax), 0 (predose), 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after a single dose and 0 (predose), 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, and 48 hours after Cycle 1 Day 11 dose|Composite of plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of Tivantinib metabolites, The following pharmacokinetic parameters will be determined: Cmax and AUClast, AUCtau, Tmax, and metabolite ratios for Cmax, AUClast, and AUCtau., 0 (predose), 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after a single dose and 0 (predose), 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, and 48 hours after Cycle 1 Day 11 dose]
