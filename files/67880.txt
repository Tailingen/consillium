A Study of IMM2510 + IMM27M Combination Therapy in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This study is an open-label, multi-centre, single-arm, phase I clinical study, to evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of IMM2510 (an anti-PD-L1/VEGF bispecific antibody fusion protein) + IMM27M (a humanized Fc-engineered anti-CTLA-4 antibody) combination therapy in patients with advanced solid tumors.

DRUG: IMM27M|DRUG: IMM2510
DLT/MTD (Dose Escalation Phase), Incidence and characteristics of Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)., Within 8 weeks after the investigational products administration (within 56 days after first dosing of C1D1)|RP2D (Dose Extension Phase), Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) of IMM27M and IMM2510, as the dose for efficacy study in Phase II, will be the dose with promising clinical responses observed in the patients, and well tolerated by patients., From the first dose until disease progresses or end of treatment for other reasons, the maximum treatment duration is not more than 48 weeks|Incidence and characteristics of AEs and SAEs (according to NCI CTCAE 5.0), Incidence and characteristics of Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) throughout the study period, were evaluated according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) V5.0., From the first dose to 30 days after the last dose [90 days for SAEs and Immune-related Adverse Event (irAEs) ], or until beginning new anti-tumor treatment
ORR, Objective Response Rate (ORR) is the proportion of patients with Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR). ORR and other efficacy evaluation indexes are based on RECIST 1.1 criteria, the iRECIST criteria is supplemental only., From date of first dose until the date of first documented progression, death from any cause, loss of follow-up, withdrawal of informed consent, or study termination by the sponsor, whichever came first, assessed up to approximately 2 years|DCR, Disease control rate (DCR) is the proportion of patients with CR, PR, and Stable Disease (SD)., From date of first dose until the date of first documented progression, death from any cause, loss of follow-up, withdrawal of informed consent, or study termination by the sponsor, whichever came first, assessed up to approximately 2 years|DOR, Duration of Response (DOR) is the time between the first onset of CR or PR and the first onset of Disease Progression (PD) or death from any cause. For patients with unknown progression or death, the time of sustained remission was censored at the time point of the last patient evaluation., From date of first dose until the date of first documented progression, death from any cause, loss of follow-up, withdrawal of informed consent, or study termination by the sponsor, whichever came first, assessed up to approximately 2 years|PFS, Progression-Free Survival (PFS) is the time between first initiation of study treatment to PD or death due to any reason. For patients with unknown progression or death, disease-free survival was censored at the time point of the last patient evaluation., From date of first dose until the date of first documented progression, death from any cause, loss of follow-up, withdrawal of informed consent, or study termination by the sponsor, whichever came first, assessed up to approximately 2 years|OS, Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time interval from the date of the first dose of study drug to the date of death from any cause., From date of first dose until the date of first documented progression, death from any cause, loss of follow-up, withdrawal of informed consent, or study termination by the sponsor, whichever came first, assessed up to approximately 2 years|Cmax, Peak concentration (Cmax), in single dose period., Up to approximately 1 year|Tmax, Peak time (Tmax), in single dose period., Up to approximately 1 year|t1/2, Elimination phase half-life (t1/2), in single dose period., Up to approximately 1 year|AUC0-t, Area under plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to the last quantifiable time point (AUC0-t), in single dose period., Up to approximately 1 year|AUC0-∞, Area under plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to infinite time (AUC0-∞), in single dose period., Up to approximately 1 year|Cmin, ss, Steady-state trough concentration (Cmin, ss), in multiple dose periods., Up to approximately 1 year|Cmax, ss, Steady-state peak concentration (Cmax, ss), in multiple dose periods., Up to approximately 1 year|Tmax, ss, Steady-state peak time (Tmax, ss), in multiple dose periods., Up to approximately 1 year|t1/2, ss, Steady-state half-life (t1/2, ss), in multiple dose periods., Up to approximately 1 year|Cav, ss, Mean plasma concentration at steady state (Cav, ss), in multiple dose periods., Up to approximately 1 year|ADA and NAb, For each patient, the presence of Anti-drug Antibody (ADA) will be assessed, and ADA positive patients need to be measured for titers and Neutralizing Antibodies (NAb)., Up to approximately 1 year
Dose Escalation Phase: 3+3 Dose escalation design of IMM27M + IMM2510 combination therapy in advanced solid tumors.

Dose Expansion Phase: Recommended dose for expansion (RDE) of IMM27M + IMM2510 combination therapy in three cohorts: cohort 1: locally advanced unresectable or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (those with at least first-line systemic treatment failure or intolerance); cohort 2: advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (patients with at least first-line systemic therapy failure or intolerance); cohort 3: other advanced solid tumors (those with at least first-line systemic treatment failure or intolerance).
