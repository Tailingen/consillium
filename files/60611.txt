First in Man Study of SAR566658 Administered in Patients With CA6-Positive and Refractory Solid Tumor
Primary Objective:

To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SAR566658

Secondary Objectives:

* To characterize the safety profile of SAR566658
* To evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of SAR566658
* To assess the potential immunogenicity of SAR566658
* To assess preliminary antitumor activity
* To assess the effect of SAR566658 at recommended dose on CYP3A enzyme activity using midazolam
* To assess safety in the alternative schedules of SAR566658 administration
Neoplasm Malignant
DRUG: SAR566658
Dose Escalation to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SAR566658, 3 weeks|Extension Cohorts to evaluate the preliminary anti-tumoral effect of SAR566658, Anticancer activity is assessed every 6 weeks|To assess the effect of SAR566658 at the recommended dose on CYP3A enzyme activity using midazolam as probe, At D1 and D4 of administration of SAR566658 for 24h of midazolam dosing
Overall safety profile based on adverse events reporting, laboratory tests, vital signs and specific pulmonary and ocular tests, according to the NCI-CTC AE v4.03, Up to 2 years|Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters, Up to 2 years|Immunogenicity evaluation (anti-drug antibodies), Up to 2 years|Antitumoral response, Up to treatment discontinuation|To assess the effect of SAR566658 at recommended dose on CYP3A enzyme activity using midazolam, Up to Cycle 2|To assess safety in the alternative schedules of SAR566658 administration, Up to 2 years
The duration of the study for one patient in the dose escalation phase of the study will include a screening period of up to 3 weeks, a 3-week treatment cycle(s) and a 2-week treatment cycle(s). The patients may continue treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or willingness to stop, followed by a minimum of 30-day follow-up. If a patient treated in dose escalation part or in an expansion cohorts, continues to benefit from the treatment at the time of Clinical Study Report, the patient can continue study treatment and will continue to undergo all assessments as per the study flowchart. Such patients will be followed at least until 30 days after the last IMP administration.
