Detecting Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) and Cell Free DNA (cfDNA) in Peripheral Blood of Breast Cancer (BC) Patients to Develop the Clinical Application for Early Detection and Diagnostics
Utilization of circulating-tumor-cell (CTC) and cell free DNA (cfDNA) as novel and noninvasive tests for diagnosis confirmation, therapy selection, and cancer surveillance is a rapidly growing area of interest. In the wake of FDA approval of a liquid biopsy test, it is important for clinicians to acknowledge the obvious clinical utility of liquid biopsy for cancer management throughout the course of the disease.
