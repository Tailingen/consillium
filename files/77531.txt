First-in-human Study of BAY2287411 Injection, a Thorium-227 Labeled Antibody-chelator Conjugate, in Patients With Tumors Known to Express Mesothelin
The purpose of this study is to evaluate, in patients with tumors known to express the protein mesothelin, the following properties of BAY2287411 injection:

* safety (to identify, assess, minimize, and appropriately manage the risks associated to the study drug)
* tolerability (the degree to which side effects can be tolerated by your body)
* maximum tolerated dose
* pharmacokinetics (the effect of your body on the study drug)
* anti-tumor activity
* recommended dose for further clinical development
