Study to Investigate the Objective Response Rate of Dabrafenib in Combination With Trametinib in Subjects With BRAF V600 Mutation-Positive Melanoma
This was a single-arm, open-label, multi-center, Phase II study to evaluate dabrafenib and trametinib combination therapy in subjects with BRAF V600 mutation-positive, unresectable or metastatic Acral lentiginous or cutaneous melanoma. This study evaluated the objective response rate (ORR), progression free survival (PFS), duration of response, overall survival (OS), safety and efficacy, to assess steady state (all subjects) exposure to dabrafenib, dabrafenib metabolites, and trametinib and characterize the population pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of dabrafenib and trametinib. Enrolled subjects were administered dabrafenib 150 milligram (mg) orally twice daily and trametinib 2 mg orally once daily. Treatment continued until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent, or study closure. After treatment discontinuation, subjects were followed for survival and disease progression as applicable.

Objective Response Rate (ORR), To determine ORR of dabrafenib in combination with trametinib in subjects with BRAF V600 mutation-positive, unresectable or metastatic melanoma. ORR is defined as the percentage of subjects with evidence of a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 and as assessed by the investigator., Up to 35 months
Progression-free Survival (PFS) - Median, PFS defined as the time from first dose of study treatment until the first date of either objective disease progression or death due to any cause, Up to 36 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS defined as the time from first dose of study treatment until the first date of either objective disease progression or death due to any cause.

An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes failure to produce expected benefits (i.e., lack of efficacy), abuse or misuse., Adverse events were reported from first dose of study treatment until end of study treatment plus 30 days post treatment, up to a maximum duration of 51 months (for both dabrafenib and also Rametinib).|Population Pharmacokinetics of Dabrafenib - Cmax, Cmax is the maximum peak concentration., Day 1 and Day 15|Population Pharmacokinetics of Dabrafenib - Tmax, Tmax is Time to Cmax (maximum peak concentration)., Day 1 and Day 15|Population Pharmacokinetics of Dabrafenib - AUC(0-12), AUC is the area under the concentration-time curve., Day 1 and Day 15|Population Pharmacokinetics of Dabrafenib - Ctrough, Ctrough is trough concentration., Day 1 and Day 15|Population Pharmacokinetics of Dabrafenib - Racc, Racc is the accumulation ratio., Day 1 and Day 15|Population Pharmacokinetics of Hydroxydabrafenib - Cmax, Cmax is the maximum peak concentration., Day 1 and Day 15|Population Pharmacokinetics of Hydroxydabrafenib - Tmax, Tmax is Time to Cmax (maximum peak concentration)., Day 1 and Day 15|Population Pharmacokinetics of Hydroxydabrafenib - AUC(0-12), AUC is the area under the concentration-time curve., Day 1 and Day 15|Population Pharmacokinetics of Hydroxydabrafenib - Rm/p, Rm/p is the metabolite-to-parent ratio., Day 1 and Day 15|Population Pharmacokinetics of Hydroxydabrafenib - Ctrough, Ctrough is trough concentration., Day 1 and Day 15|Population Pharmacokinetics of Hydroxydabrafenib - Racc, Racc is the accumulation ratio., Day 1 and Day 15|Population Pharmacokinetics of Desmethyl-dabrafenib - Cmax, Cmax is the maximum peak concentration., Day 1 and Day 15|Population Pharmacokinetics of Desmethyl-dabrafenib - Tmax, Tmax is Time to Cmax (maximum peak concentration)., Day 1 and Day 15|Population Pharmacokinetics of Desmethyl-dabrafenib - AUC(0-12), AUC is the area under the concentration-time curve.

This was an open-label, single arm, Phase IIA, multi-center study to evaluate the Objective response rate (ORR) of dabrafenib and trametinib combination therapy in East Asian subjects that have BRAF V600 mutationpositive Stage IIIC (unresectable) or Stage IV (metastatic) acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM) or cutaneous melanoma.

All subjects enrolled received oral dabrafenib 150 mg bid in combination with oral trametinib 2 mg once daily. A primary analysis presented the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) data up to the data cut-off date of 23-Feb-2018. Based on these results, dabrafenib and trametinib combination was approved in the People's Republic of China (PRC) for the treatment of BRAF-mutation positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma. Data from Mainland Chinese subjects from 01-Jul-2019 onwards are not included due to local regulations in China.

Subjects continued study treatment until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or study completion. After treatment discontinuation, subjects went into follow-up for survival and disease progression as applicable. Subjects could continue study treatment after disease progression if they achieved clinical response per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 or stable disease with tumour reduction; had no overt signs of toxicity; had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of â‰¤1 and did not require immediate surgical or radiological intervention.
