Remote Outpatient Temperature Monitoring for Early Detection of Febrile Neutropenia After Chemotherapy
Febrile neutropenic patients are at high risk for developing sepsis and other infections which often necessitates acute admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and are associated with high mortality. Neutropenic fever is a medical emergency and early detection of fever allows for prompt infectious work up. In this study, the investigators will collect pilot data from outpatients utilizing a remote outpatient continuous temperature monitoring device to compare the incidence of ICU admission and severe sepsis to historical data for prior patients who did not receive at home monitoring device.
