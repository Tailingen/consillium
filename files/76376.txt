Biomarker for Infection Risk in CLL and MM
The aim of this research study is to use advanced immunology laboratory analysis to identify a more precise blood test that will predict infection risk in patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia or Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (CLL/SLL) or Multiple Myeloma (MM).

The goal of this research study is to identify an antigen-specific antibody profiling biomarker associated with increased risk of any infections in patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia or Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (CLL/SLL) or Multiple Myeloma (MM).

Research procedures including screening for eligibility, clinic visits, and blood tests.

This involves performing blood tests which detect antibodies directed against specific pathogens and measure their functional capacity, and collecting information about outcomes in patients.

Participation in this research study is expected to last 2 years.

It is expected that about 150 people CLL or MM will take part in this research study, and this will predominantly include people with CLL/SLL.
