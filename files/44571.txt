Preoperative Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy for Potentially Resectable Adenocarcinoma of the Esophagogastric Junction
Stage I：preoperative therapy

* Capecitabine plus oxaliplatin with concurrent radiotherapy is superior to surgery alone ; Stage II: Perioperative therapy
* Perioperative Capecitabine plus oxaliplatin with Concurrent radiotherapy is superior to adjuvant Capecitabine plus oxaliplatin alone;
* A regimen of Capecitabine plus oxaliplatin(XELOX) improves survival among patients with incurable locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of stomach and gastroesophageal cancer . The investigators assessed whether the addition of a perioperative regimen of XELOX regimen with concurrent radiotherapy to adjuvant alone improves R0 resection rate and survival among patients with curable locally advanced adenocarcinoma of stomach and gastroesophageal cancer
