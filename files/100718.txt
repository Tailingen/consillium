Symptom Clusters in Hong Kong Chinese Children With Blood Cancer
Pediatric blood cancer is the most common childhood malignancy. Despite its survival has been substantially improved, children still have to pay a high price for numerous distressing symptoms resulted from chemotherapy. Previous studies related to symptom experiences mainly focus on individual symptoms, rather than on multiple symptoms. Understanding these distressing symptoms may help healthcare professionals to develop appropriate and effective interventions with the aims of alleviating symptom severity and thus promoting the child's psychosocial well-being and quality of life.
