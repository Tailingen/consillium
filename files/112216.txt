Clinical Trial to Investigate Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, and Efficacy of DA-4505 as a Single Agent and in Combination With Pembrolizumab in Adult Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This study is an Open-Label, Phase 1/2a, First-in-Human, Dose-Escalation, Dose-Expansion, and Proof-of-Concept Study to Investigate Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, and Efficacy of DA-4505 as a Single Agent and in Combination With Pembrolizumab in Adult Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors.
Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
DRUG: DA-4505|DRUG: DA-4505 + Pembrolizumab
Proportion of adverse events (AEs) meeting protocol-defined dose-limiting toxicity(DLT) criteria, The recommended Phase 2 dose(RP2D) will be the optimal biological dose (OBD) based on consideration of safety and tolerability information along with all available pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), and efficacy data., Cycle 1(21 days) in dose escalation|PK parameters for DA-4505 (Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax)), Determine DA-4505 Cmax, Day 1 and 2 of first 2 cycles (every 21 days)|PK parameters for DA-4505 (Area Under the Curve (AUC)), Determine DA-4505 AUC, Day 1 and 2 of first 2 cycles (every 21 days)|PK parameters for DA-4505 (half-life (t1/2)), Determine DA-4505 half-life (t1/2)., Day 1 and 2 of first 2 cycles (every 21 days)|Response per revised "Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v) 1.1), To determine the anti-tumor activity of both DA-4505 as a single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab, approximately 12 months
