The Incidence of Pulmonary Embolism During Nephrectomy
Patients with renal carcinoma was reported at high incidence of perioperative pulmonary embolism from current study. The investigators aimed to determine the incidence and outcome of this group of patient in the tertiary-care, university hospital and the rate of intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography utility and outcome.

* acute respiratory distress syndrome, 7 days after surgery|Rate of TEE utilization, TEE utilization

* for monitoring (use when the case begins)
* for rescue (use when unexplained hypotension or hemodynamic collapsed), 7 days after surgery|Mortality rate at 30 days postoperative, Patients death after surgery, 30 days after surgery
Perioperative pulmonary embolism (PE) is the serious adverse event leading to major morbidity and mortality. The incidence of PE during urologic surgery was previously report at 0.9 - 1.1% with mortality rate less than 2%. But the recent study by Fukazawa et al report the incidence of PE was 11% in renal cancer patients underwent nephrectomy with mortality rate as high as 33%. The risk factors associated with PE included major surgery, cancer, arrhythmia, massive bleeding and level of tumor thrombus in inferior vena cava.

Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is a very helpful intraoperative monitoring tool in major, non-cardiac surgery to detect emboli and guide the hemodynamic management in severely unstable patients. But it requires sophisticate machine and well-trained operator, the rate of utilisation was still limited.

The investigators aimed to determine the incidence of perioperative PE in renal cancer patients undergoing nephrectomy. the secondary outcomes include risk factors associated with perioperative PE, clinical outcomes, the rate of TEE utilization in this operation and outcome.
