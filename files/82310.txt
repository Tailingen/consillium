A Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of Giredestrant Combined With Palbociclib Compared With Letrozole Combined With Palbociclib in Participants With Estrogen Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer (persevERA Breast Cancer)
This Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of giredestrant combined with palbociclib compared with letrozole combined with palbociclib in patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)-negative locally advanced (recurrent or progressed) or metastatic breast cancer.
