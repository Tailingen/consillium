Radioactive Holmium Microspheres for the Treatment of Unresectable Liver Metastases
Radioembolisation is a known method for the treatment of liver tumors and or livermetastases. Currently small beadlets called microspheres are used that are loaded with the beta radiation emitting Yttrium-90. Holmium-166 microspheres have different physical characteristics including good visualisation in gammacameras due to the gamma emission. Because of the higher specific activity higher radiation doses to the liver will be used compared to the standard Yttrium treatment. It is hypothesized that higher doses of irradiation have an improved antitumor effect.
Liver Neoplasms
DEVICE: Holmium-166 polylactic microspheres
Target lesions tumour response, After the administration of the Ho-166 microspheres the size of the target lesions in the liver will be determined using RECIST 1.1 criteria using CT scan, 3 month after treatment
Toxicity according CTC v 4 criteria, Clinical evaluation and laboratory testing after week 1,3,6,9,12,24,36,52, Clinical evaluation after 1,3,6,9,12,24,36,52 weeks
