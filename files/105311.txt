A Study of Cadonilimab（AK104）Combined With Standard Treatment for Function Preservation in Urinary System Tumors
This is an open label, dual cohort ,phase II study to explore efficacy and safety of cadonilimab(PD-1/CTLA-4 Bispecific Antibody) combined with standard regimen neoadjuvant treatment in urothelial carcinoma（UC） and renal cell carcinoma（RCC）, with evaluating successful preservation rate of bladder/kidney.
Urinary System Tumor
DRUG: Cadonilimab plus chemotherapy|DRUG: Cadonilimab plus TKI
Bladder/Kidney Preservation rate, Evaluating the impact of neoadjuvant therapy on organ preservation function, Up to approximately 18 Weeks (Time of surgery)
Objective Response Rate (ORR), percentage of participants with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), Up to approximately 18 Weeks|Rate of Pathologic Response, No residual tumor (ypT0N0) and partial response (ypTis-1N0) in surgical specimen., Up to approximately 18 Weeks (Time of surgery) ]|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the time from enrollment to death due to any cause., Up to approximately 36 Months|Assess Adverse Events, Assess adverse events according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v5.0, 12 months
UC and RCC confirmed by histopathology or cytology prior have not received systematic treatment, who had indications for surgical resection and were difficult to preserve organ function after surgery or were partially resection but the patients have a strong desire to preserve organ function. This study enrolled 20 cases in each cohort of UC and RCC，pts received neoadjuvant treatment containing cadonilimab for no more than 6 cycles.
