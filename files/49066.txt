MySmartSkin Online Skin Self-exam Intervention for Melanoma Survivors
This project, mySmartSkin (MSS), includes an innovative Type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial designed to enhance the effects of MSS and simultaneously assess key implementation outcomes (e.g., cost, adoption) as well as contextual factors important for scale-up in community and health care settings where melanoma survivors receive follow-up care. A type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation design allows us to engage multilevel stakeholders throughout this process, evaluate the effectiveness of the enhanced MSS, and identify critical factors for wide-scale implementation. Aim 1 will focus on enhancing the previous version of MSS by collaborating with multi-level stakeholders in qualitative interviews and usability testing. Aim 2 will evaluate the effects of enhanced MSS on thorough skin-self examinations (SSE) in a randomized-control trial (RCT) and examine its impact on the diagnosis of new/recurrent melanomas. Aim 3 will focus on assessing selected implementation outcomes and identify factors relevant to future scale-up for widespread dissemination and implementation.

Body parts examined, Yes/No for a list of body parts examined during most recent SSE in the last three months. This is the primary outcome because SSE thoroughness is associated with detection of thinner tumors. This will be assessed by Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance(RE-AIM) and Practical, Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model (PRISM)., Baseline|Body parts examined, Yes/No for a list of body parts examined during most recent SSE in the last three months.

This is a type one hybrid effectiveness-implementation study consisting of three aims. Aim one (Months 1-15) focuses on MSS enhancement using stakeholder collaboration. Aim two (Months 16-60) involves the longitudinal randomized control trial (RCT) comparing behavioral outcomes and effectiveness of enhanced MSS versus an educational webpage. Aim three (Months 16-60) will assess implementation outcomes and identify contextual factors to facilitate scale-up for future dissemination and implementation.
