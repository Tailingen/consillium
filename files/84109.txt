Preoperative Lenvatinib Plus Pembrolizumab in Early-Stage Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC)
This is single arm study of a window of opportunity in which participants with previously untreated triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) who are candidates for potentially curative surgery will receive lenvatinib 12 mg daily for 7 and pembrolizumab 200 mg IV on day 1 prior to surgery

Evaluate the effectiveness of preoperative anti-vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) therapy and immune checkpoint blockade on infiltration of CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) (CD45RA-/CD8+/FoxP3-) in primary tumors from patients, Measuring the presence of a T-cell inflamed TME, characterized by infiltration of CD8+ TILs, 2 years
Evaluate clinical response to preoperative anti-VEGFR therapy and immune checkpoint blockade based on pathologic complete response and residual tumor burden in subjects receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy and changes in the Ki-67 index in all patients., Reviewing pathology report, At the point of surgery|Evaluate treatment tolerability of preoperative anti-VEGFR therapy and immune checkpoint blockade assessed by failure to completed planned course of neoadjuvant chemo-immune therapy and surgery in patients with early-stage TNBC, Assessing for adverse events (e.g., infections) using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 5, 30 days post treatment
Evaluate quality of life in patients with early-stage TNBC treated with preoperative anti-VEGFR therapy and immune checkpoint blockade, Reviewing questionnaires European Organization for Research, and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 administered at screening, first post-op visit and final visit, 5 years
This is a single arm study of a window of opportunity study in which participants with previously untreated triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) who are candidates for potentially curative surgery will receive therapy prior to surgery, consisting of lenvatinib 12 mg daily for 7 days and pembrolizumab 200 mg IV on day 1. Subjects will either have curative surgery 7-10 days after last dose of lenvatinib, and post-operative adjuvant therapy as per institution guidelines or have a research core biopsy of the breast tumor 7-10 days after last dose of lenvatinib, and standard of care neoadjuvant chemotherapy +/_ immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, then curative surgery, post-operative adjuvant therapy as per institution guidelines
