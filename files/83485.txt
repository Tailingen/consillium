Transanal Decompression Tube Versus Stent for Acute Malignant Left-sided Colonic and Rectal Obstruction
The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical outcomes of transanal decompression tube as a bridge to surgery with stent as a bridge to surgery for acute malignant left-sided colonic and rectal obstruction.
Colonic Cancer|Rectal Cancer
DEVICE: Transanal decompression tube|DEVICE: Stent
Creation of stoma, Creation of stoma include temporary and definitive stoma., From the date of randomization until the date of first documented creation of stoma, assessed up to 24 months
Transanal decompression tube/stent-related complications, Transanal decompression tube/stent-related complications usually include bowel perforation, migration, and stent re-obstruction., From the date of randomization until the date of first documented transanal decompression tube/stent-related complication, assessed up to 7 days|Surgery-related complications, Surgery-related complications usually include wound complications and anastomotic leak., From the date of randomization until the date of first documented surgery-related complication, assessed up to 24 months|Overall survival, From the date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 24 months
Approximately 8-47 % of patients with colorectal cancer will present with colonic obstruction. Left-sided colonic and rectal cancer is responsible for nearly 70% of acute colonic obstruction. Emergency colonic surgery for acute obstruction is associated with a higher mortality and morbidity rate than elective surgery. Preoperative decompression results in a less dilated bowel that is more amenable to an elective surgery. Both transanal decompression tube and stent can serve a good preoperative decompression effect and serve a good bridge to surgery. Investigators aim to compare the clinical outcomes of transanal decompression tube as a bridge to surgery with stent as a bridge to surgery for acute malignant left-sided colonic and rectal obstruction.
