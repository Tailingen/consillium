Efficacy of Bilateral Ultrasonic Guided Sphenopalatine Ganglion Block in Maxilofacial Cancer Surgeries
Patients will be randomly allocated according to computer - generated tables to one of two groups, group (A) ultrasonic guided sphenopalatine block using local anasthetic, group (B) ultrasonic guided sphenopalatine block using saline. Before induction anesthesia the following will be assessed, time needed to perform the technique, time till onset of the block, distribution of the block (Opthalmic, Maxillary, Mandibular) by needle brick.Intra and post- operatively the following will be assesse the quality of operative filed every 30 min intra-operatively using a pre- defined average category scale (ACS) (from 0 to 5), End tidal Sevo Flurane concentration will be recorded intra- operatively every 5 minutes, The total amount of Nitroglycerine used to achieve the target MAP and frequency of propranolol usage will be recorded,emergence time, postoperative VAS score and amount of meperdine used for rescue analgesia.
