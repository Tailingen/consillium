Median Change From Baseline to Week 7, of Interferon (IFN) and Interferon Gamma (IFN-gamma) Inducible Factors, Baseline and post-treatment modulation of serum levels of chemokines, cytokines and other immune mediators were assessed by techniques that included ELISA or other multiplex-based assay methods. Primary analysis included IFN-gamma and IFN-gamma inducible factors, including chemokine \[C-X-C motif\] ligand 9 (CXCL9) and CXCL10, From last non-missing value prior to first dose to week 7 day 1|Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TILs) as Measured by Medians in Percent Positive CD8 and Positive CD4 at Baseline and On-treatment Biopsy, Both Using the Mosaic Singleplex IHC Assay, Biomarkers examined were percent positive CD8 and percent positive CD4, both using the Mosaic Singleplex IHC assay. Analyses are presented with the medians at baseline and on-treatment, rather than the median change because the baseline values differed across groups. Baseline was defined as the last non-missing value on or prior to the first dose of study therapy. Biopsies were also collected on treatment., From last non-missing value prior to first dose to week 4 day 1
Frequency of Adverse Events or Death, The assessment of safety was based on frequency of deaths and adverse events (AEs).

The BOR was defined as the participant's best response designation, over the study as a whole, recorded between the date of first study drug administration and the date of objectively documented progression per RECIST 1.1, with subsequent confirmation, or date of subsequent anti-cancer therapy, whichever occurred first in the study., Approximately every 8 weeks until disease progression and in follow-up if no progression (up to approximately 73 months)|Median Duration of Response (mDOR), Median duration of response (mDOR) was calculated for subjects with BOR of CR or PR only, and is defined as time between the date of first documented objective response and the date of the first subsequent disease progression or death, whichever occurred first, if death occurred within 100 days after last dose of study medication., From date of first documented objective response to date of disease progression or death, up to approximately 27 months|Median Time to Response (mTTR), Median time to response (mTTR) for a participant with a BOR of CR or PR is defined as the time from the first dosing date to the date of the first documented objective response (CR or PR)., From the first dosing date to the date of the first documented objective response, up to approximately 15 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression free survival (PFS) for a participant was defined as the time from the date of first dose of study medication to the date of the first documented disease progression, or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first, if death occurred within 100 days after last dose of study medication., From first dose of study medication to the date of progression or death, whichever occurs first, up to approximately 29 months|Immunogenicity of Nivolumab and Nivolumab in Combination With Ipilimumab as Measured by the Number of Serum Anti-drug Antibody (ADA) Positive Participants and the Number of Neutralizing ADA Positive Participants, Time Frame: Part 1: Day 1, Day 15, Day 43 of cycle 1, Day 1 of cycle 2, Day 15 of cycle 3, every 16 weeks after cycle 3 up to 2 years, follow-up visit 1 (40-60 days after last treatment), and follow-up visit 2 (101-120 days since last treatment) Part 2, 3 and 4: Weeks 1, 3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 13, 25, 53, 79, 95 follow-up visit 1 (40-60 days after last treatment), and follow-up visit 2 (101-120 days since last treatment), Up to follow-up visit 2 (101-120 days since last treatment)|Objective Response Rate (ORR) by PD-L1 Expression, For immunohistochemistry (IHC) measurements, to explore the PD-L1 expression as a potential predictive marker of clinical activity, PD-L1 expression status were derived from percent of tumor cells exhibiting cell surface staining for PD-L1 at baseline and/or in archived biopsy samples using verified and/or validated assays. In the case of multiple specimens, a subject would be identified as PD-L1 expression levels \>= x%, where x% can be 10%, 5%, and/or 1% in any of the baseline and/or archived specimens. The association between PD-L1 expression status and/or level and clinical efficacy measures was assessed. The objective response rate (ORR) was defined as the number of subjects with a best overall response (BOR) of a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) divided by the number of randomized subjects in the population of interest (all response-evaluable participants)., Approximately every 8 weeks until disease progression and in follow-up if no progression (up to approximately 73 months)|Duration of Response (DOR) by PD-L1 Expression, For immunohistochemistry (IHC) measurements, to explore the PD-L1 expression as a potential predictive marker of clinical activity, PD-L1 expression status were derived from percent of tumor cells exhibiting cell surface staining for PD-L1 at baseline and/or in archived biopsy samples using verified and/or validated assays. In the case of multiple specimens, a subject would be identified as PD-L1 expression levels \>= x%, where x% can be 10%, 5%, and/or 1% in any of the baseline and/or archived specimens. Median duration of response (mDOR) was calculated for all response-evaluable participants with best overall response of CR or PR only, and is defined as time between the date of first documented objective response and the date of the first subsequent disease progression or death, whichever occurred first, if death occurred within 100 days after last dose of study medication., From the date of first documented objective response and the date of the first subsequent disease progression or death, whichever occurred first, up to approximately 73 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS) by PD-L1 Expression, For immunohistochemistry (IHC) measurements, to explore the PD-L1 expression as a potential predictive marker of clinical activity, PD-L1 expression status were derived from percent of tumor cells exhibiting cell surface staining for PD-L1 at baseline and/or in archived biopsy samples using verified and/or validated assays. In the case of multiple specimens, a subject would be identified as PD-L1 expression levels \>= x%, where x% can be 10%, 5%, and/or 1% in any of the baseline and/or archived specimens. The association between PD-L1 expression status and/or level and clinical efficacy measures was assessed. The progression free survival rate (PFSR) for a subject was defined as the time from the date of first dose of study medication to the date of the first documented disease progression, or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first, if death occurred within 100 days after last dose of study medication., From first dose of study medication to the date of progression or death, whichever occurs first, up to approximately 29 months|Overall Survival Rate (OSR), The percentage of participants surviving to time t, where t is a specific length of time, eg, 12 months, which was determined by the available data for final analysis and was documented in the DPP. The percentage was calculated by the product-limit method (Kaplan-Meier estimate), which takes into account censored data. The overall survival rate (OSR) for a participant was defined as the time from the date of first dose of study medication to the date of death for any cause. A participant who had not died was censored at last known date alive., From first dose of study medication to the date of death for any cause, up to approximately 73 months|Percent Probability for Progression Free Survival Rate (PFSR), The Progression Free Survival Rate (PFSR) is defined as the probability of a participant remaining progression free or survival to time t, where t is equal to the specified timepoints. This probability will be calculated by the product limit method (Kaplan-Meier estimates) which takes into account censored data.

Medians and 95% confidence interval are estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. If there is an insufficient number of events, the median and confidence intervals cannot be calculated., From first dose up to the specified timepoints of 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months
