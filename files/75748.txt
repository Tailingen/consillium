Window of Opportunity Trial of Dasatinib in Operable Triple Negative Breast Cancers With nEGFR
Primary Objective:

To determine if dasatinib, an inhibitor of the Src family kinases, can prevent the nuclear translocation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in Stage I-III, nuclear EGFR positive, triple negative breast cancers (TNBC).

Secondary Objectives:

1. To examine the safety and tolerability of dasatinib in patients with operable TNBC
2. To explore potential intracellular mechanisms which impact dasatinib effect on cellular localization of EGFR in operable TNBC.
3. To examine the pathologic complete response (pCR) rates to standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy in nEGFR+ TNBC
4. To examine breast cancer recurrence rates and patterns of metastatic recurrent in nEGFR+ TNBC
Breast Neoplasms|Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms
DRUG: Dasatinib|PROCEDURE: Conventional Surgery|OTHER: Laboratory Biomarker Analysis
Plasma Membrane Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Expression, Measured by VECTRA Imaging, An increase of at least 25% from baseline to post-dasatinib treatment will be considered significant. VECTRA is an automated pathology imaging system used to detect biomarkers in samples., 7-10 days
Number of Treatment-emergent Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability] up to 4 Weeks, Safety and tolerability of dasatinib in participants with operable Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) will be based on NCI Adverse Events (AE) Version 4.0 and will be assessed by frequency tables. AEs were collected on day 1 of treatment and a minimum of 14 days after the last dose. AEs reported here were ranked as either possibly related, probably related, or definitely related to the study intervention. All AEs (including not related and unlikely related) are summarized in the AE section., Up to 4 weeks|Number of Participants With Pathologic Complete Response (pCR), Examine pCR rates to standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy in nuclear Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (nEGFR) + TNBC. pCR will be defined as ypT0 ypNO (absence of cancer in breast tissue and lymph nodes) an assessed by the investigator., Up to 4 weeks|Number of Participants With No Evidence of Disease (NED) at Long-term Follow up, up to 24 months
