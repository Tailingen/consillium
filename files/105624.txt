A Study to Test the Effect of the Drug Larotrectinib in Adults and Children With NTRK-fusion Positive Solid Tumors
This research study is done to test how well different types of cancer respond to the drug called larotrectinib. The cancer must have a change in a particular gene (NTRK1, NTRK2 or NTRK3). Larotrectinib is a drug that blocks the actions of these NTRK genes in cancer cells and can therefore be used to treat cancer.
Solid Tumors Harboring NTRK Fusion
DRUG: BAY2757556 (Larotrectinib, Vitrakvi)
Best overall response of confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as determined by an independent radiology review committee using RECIST v1.1 or RANO criteria, as appropriate to tumor type., Up to 120 months
Best overall response of confirmed CR or PR as determined by the treating Investigator using RECIST v1.1 or RANO criteria, as appropriate to tumor type, Up to 120 months|Duration of response (DOR): determined for subjects with best overall response of confirmed CR or PR by 1) an independent radiology review committee and 2) the treating Investigator, Duration of response is the number of months from the start of confirmed complete response or partial response to disease progression or death. Complete response, partial response and disease progression are assessed by an independent radiology committee (IRC)., Up to 120 months|Clinical benefit rate (CBR): best overall response of confirmed CR, PR, or stable disease lasting 16 or more weeks following the initiation of Larotrectinib, Up to 120 months|Rate of subjects that have any tumor regression as a best response, measured as shrinkage of target lesions, Up to 120 months|PFS: Number of months from initiation of larotrectinib to the earlier of disease progression or death due to any cause, Up to 120 months|Overall Survival (OS): Number of months from the initiation of larotrectinib to the date of death due to any cause., Up to 120 months|Comparison of PFS following initiation of larotrectinib to that following the line of therapy immediately preceding larotrectinib in each subject who has received prior therapy, Up to 120 months|Number of subjects with AEs categorized by severity. (including all, serious, and those considered treatment related.), Up to 120 months|Number of subjects with safety-relevant changes in clinical parameters or vital signs after drug administration, Up to 120 months|Severity of safety-relevant changes in clinical parameters or vital signs after drug administration, Up to 120 months|Concordance coefficient, Concordance of prior molecular profiling that detected an NTRK fusion within the subject's tumor with the diagnostic test being evaluated by the Sponsor., Up to 120 months
The primary objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy of larotrectinib for the treatment of advanced solid tumors harboring a fusion of neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) of types 1-3 in children and adults.

Secondary objectives comprise the efficacy and safety of larotrectinib in different NTRK-tumor types.
