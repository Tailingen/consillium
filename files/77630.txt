Dose Finding Study of BI 836880 in Patients With Solid Tumors
This is a Phase I, non-randomized, uncontrolled, open-label, dose escalating study of BI 836880 administered intravenously. The eligible patient population will be patients with advanced solid tumours. At any time during the trial, it will not be permitted to escalate to a dose which does not fulfil the escalation with overdose control (EWOC) criterion
Neoplasms
DRUG: BI 836880
The primary endpoint to assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is based on the number of patients presenting dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) using CTCAE v4.03, judged to be related to the study medication evaluated over the first cycle of treatment., 3 weeks
Number of patients experiencing drug related AE leading to dose reduction or discontinuation from start of treatment until end of treatment, up to 24 weeks|Exposure measures (AUC0-tz) after the first dose, 36 weeks|Disposition kinetic measures (t1/2 ) after the first dose, 36 weeks
