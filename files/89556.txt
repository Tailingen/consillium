A Retrospective Study of Radiotherapy Combined With EGFR-TKI for Stage III EGFR Mutant Lung Cancer
Objective: To investigate the efficacy and safety of radiotherapy combined with EGFR-KI in the treatment of stage III EGFR mutant lung cancer. Methods: Stage III EGFR mutant lung cancer cases who underwent radiotherapy combined with EGFR-TKI from December 2014 to December 2022 at the People's Hospital of Laibin, the First People's Hospital of Yulin, the Affiliated Hospital of Guilin Medical College, and the Park East Hospital of Guangxi Medical University Kaiyuan were collected, and the primary index of the study was progression-free survival (PFS), and the secondary indexes were objective remission rate, overall survival, recurrence pattern, and adverse events. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method with Log rank test for univariate analysis and Cox proportional risk model for multifactorial analysis of prognosis.
The Primary Study Metric is Progression-free Survival (PFS)
progression-free survival (PFS), the time from treatment initiation to first documented progressive disease (PD) or time to death., 2 years
