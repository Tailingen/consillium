A Clinical Trial Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of Intravenous HNF4α srRNA in Treating Advanced ICC Patients
The goal of this investigator-initiated, a single-arm, open-label, pilot study is to investigate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of intravenous HNF4α srRNA treatment in subjects with advanced Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma (ICC).

Condition of disease: advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma Intervention： HNF4α srRNA will be administered intravenously for the treatment of ICC. The dosing regimen is planned for a second dose 14 ± 3 days post-initial treatment, followed by subsequent treatments every 28 ± 7 days, with adjustments made based on patient tolerance and therapeutic response. This is a dose escalation assay employing a i3+3 design to assess escalating HNF4α srRNA dosages: 25 μg, 50 μg, and 100 μg. Post-initial dose, a 14-day dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) observation will evaluate tolerability and safety, guiding dose adjustments or selection of the Recommended Dose (RD) for the expansion phase. Cohorts may include up to 9 participants, adjusted for safety.

Drug: HNF4α srRNA, a drug specifically designed to target liver cancer cells and facilitate the expression of HNF4α.

According to Amendment 1, patients who have received at least 4 cycles of HNF4α srRNA therapy and have a tumor assessment of SD (stable disease) or PD (progressive disease) per RECIST v1.1 criteria may, after a comprehensive evaluation by the investigator considering the patient's treatment history and the current safety and efficacy data of HNF4α srRNA, continue HNF4α srRNA at the same dose, or have their dose adjusted, in combination with immunotherapy, targeted therapy, or chemotherapy.
Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma
DRUG: HNF4α srRNA
To evaluate the tolerability and safety for intravenous HNF4α srRNA in subjects with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), Safety and tolerability are assessed based on the incidence of Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) within 14 days post-initial drug administration, along with the frequency and severity of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and events leading to treatment discontinuation throughout the treatment period, all evaluated using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0. According to Amendment 1, the primary endpoint has been amended from assessing the incidence and severity of DLTs, adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and AEs leading to treatment discontinuation (evaluated per NCI-CTCAE 5.0) with HNF4α srRNA therapy to assessing these outcomes for both HNF4α srRNA monotherapy and combination therapy., Through study completion, an average of 2 years
To assess the objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST v1.1, To assess the proportion of subjects who have best overall response of complete response or partial response at the time of data cutoff based on RECIST v1.1. According to Amendment 1, the secondary endpoint has been updated from evaluating the ORR per RECIST v1.1 with HNF4α srRNA therapy to evaluating the ORR for both monotherapy and combination therapy with HNF4α srRNA per RECIST v1.1., From the first study dose date until the date of documented complete response or partial response, assessed up to 24 months.|Duration of response based on RECIST v1.1, To assess the time from the first documentation of complete response or partial response to the date of first documentation of disease progression or death (whichever occurs first) based on RECIST v1.1, up to 24 months|Progression-free survival based on RECIST v1.1, To assess the time from the first study dose date to the date of first documentation of disease progression or death(whichever occurs first) based on RECIST v1.1, up to 24 months|Time to response based on RECIST v1.1, To assess the time from the date of first study dose to the date of first documentation of complete response or partial response based on RECIST v1.1, up to 24 months|Clinical benefit rate based on RECIST v1.1, To assess the proportion of subjects who have best overall response of complete response or partial response or durable stable disease (duration of stable disease ≥ 23 weeks) based on RECIST v1.1, up to 24 months|Overall Survival, To assess the time from the first study dose date until date of death from any cause . Subjects who are lost to follow-up and the subjects who are alive at the date of data cutoff will be censored at the date the subject was last known alive or the cut-off date, whichever comes earlier., Throughout the entire course of treatment until the end of the follow-up period, an average of 2 years|Patient Reported Outcome-1, The effect of HNF4α srRNA on the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30，EORTC QLQ-C30, Through study completion, an average of 2 years|Patient Reported Outcome-2, The effect of HNF4α srRNA on the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life, EORTC QLQ-BIL21 Questionnaire-BIL21, Through study completion, an average of 2 years|Patient Reported Outcome-3, The effect of HNF4α srRNA on The Generic Euroquol Five Dimension Five Level (EQ-5D-5L) Questionnaire, Through study completion, an average of 2 years|The impact of HNF4α srRNA treatment on tumor biomarkers in serum, The changes in tumor markers after treatment, including CA19-9, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), Through study completion, an average of 2 years
