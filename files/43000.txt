Phase 2 Futibatinib in Combination With PD-1 Antibody Based Standard of Care in Solid Tumors
This is a nonrandomized, uncontrolled, open-label, multicenter Phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of futibatinib in combination with PD-1 antibody-based SoC therapy in adult patients with solid tumors.
Locally Advanced Unresectable or Metastatic Solid Tumors Including Esophageal Cancer|Esophageal Adenocarcinoma|Esophageal Squamous Cell Cancer|Siewert Type 1 GEJ Cancer|Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: Futibatinib|DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: 5-FU|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Leucovorin|DRUG: Levoleucovorin|DRUG: Irinotecan
ORR by investigator assessment, Defined as the proportion of patients experiencing a best overall response of partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) (per RECIST 1.1), based on investigator assessment, 12 months
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, Safety will be assessed based on reported AEs (including SAEs), graded by CTCAE V5.0., and dose modifications., 12 months|DoR per investigator assessment, defined as time from the first documentation of response to the first documentation of objective tumor progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, 12 months|DCR per investigator assessment, defined as percentage of patients who achieve complete response, partial response or stable disease per RECIST 1.1 by investigator assessment, 12 months|PFS per investigator assessment, defined as the time from date of enrollment to the date of disease progression based on Investigator assessment of radiographic images or death, whichever occurs first, 12 months|6-month PFS rate, defined as percentage of patients without disease progression within 6 months of enrollment, 12 months
Patients with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic esophageal cancer (EC) or pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) will receive futibatinib in combination with pembrolizumab plus standard of care (SOC) chemotherapy. Patients with EC will receive Investigator choice of chemotherapy (FP or mFOLFOX6), patients with PDAC will receive mFOLFIRINOX. Subjects will receive futibatinib in combination with pembrolizumab plus standard of care (SOC) chemotherapy during induction phase of the study and will continue on futibatinib in combination with pembrolizumab in consolidation phase.
