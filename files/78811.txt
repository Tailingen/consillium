Anlotinib Hydrochloride Capsules Combined With Penpulimab Injection for the Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma at High Risk of Recurrence.
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of anlotinib hydrochloride capsules combined with penpulimab injection (test group) versus placebo (control group) for adjuvant therapy after radical surgery or ablation in HCC patients with high risk of recurrence by assessing recurrence-free survival (RFS).

Recurrence-free survival (RFS), RFS assessed by the Blinded Independent Image Review Committee and the investigator is the time from randomization to the first local, regional recurrence or distant metastasis, or death from any cause, whichever occurred first., Baseline up to 3 years.
Time to recurrence(TTR), TTR assessed by the Blinded Independent Image Review Committee and the investigator is the time from randomization to the first local, regional recurrence or distant metastasis, whichever occurred first., Baseline up to 3 years.|Time to extrahepatic metastasis or macrovascular invasion, Time to extrahepatic metastasis or macrovascular invasion as assessed by the investigator., Baseline up to 3 years.|Overall survival (OS), OS defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of death due to any cause., Baseline up to 3 years.|Objective response rate (ORR) after first recurrence, subjects with evaluable tumor lesion status who were cross-treated with Anlotinib hydrochloride capsules combined with Penpulimab injection developed complete response or partial response after a first HCC relapse as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1., Baseline up to 3 years.
