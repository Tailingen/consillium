The participant answers questions about their health during the past week. There are 28 questions answered on a 4-point scale where 1 =Not at all (best) to 4 =Very Much (worst) and 2 questions answered on a 7-point scale where 1 =Very poor (worst) to 7 =Excellent (best). Higher scores in GHS and functional scales indicate better quality of life., Every three cycles during the treatment period|Cohort 1 and Pooled Cohorts: Change from baseline in EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire - Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Module 17 Items (QLQ-CLL17) Symptom Burden and Physical Condition Scales, The symptom burden and physical condition/fatigue will be measured by EQ-5D-5L. EQ-5D-5L is a standardized instrument that measures health-related quality of life for men with prostate cancer. EQ-5D consists of EQ-5D descriptive system and EQ visual analogue scale (VAS). EQ-5D descriptive system comprises of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: 1=no problems, 2=slight problems, 3=moderate problems, 4=severe problems, and 5=extreme problems. Number of participants with various responses to the mobility questionnaire are reported., Every three cycles during the treatment period|Cohort 1 and Pooled Cohorts: Change from baseline in European Quality of Life 5-Dimensions 5-Levels Health Questionnaire （EQ-5D-5L) Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)., Mean change from baseline in EQ-5D-5L VAS. The EQ-5D-5L measures health outcomes using a VAS to record a participant's self-rated health on a scale from 0 to 100, where 100 is 'the best health you can imagine' and 0 is 'the worst health you can imagine. A higher score indicates better health outcomes., Every three cycles during the treatment period
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is a type of blood cancer that affects people around the world. People with CLL suffer from enlarged lymph nodes, spleen, or liver, or have symptoms like night sweats, weight loss and fever. They have shorter life expectancy compared to healthy people. There is an urgent need for new treatment to prolong life and control disease-related symptoms.

In this study, participants with CLL without prior treatment will receive either venetoclax plus obinutuzumab combination treatment that is considered a standard first line treatment or receive sonrotoclax plus zanubrutinib. It is hypothesized that sonrotoclax plus zanubrutinib may be better than venetoclax plus obinutuzumab in treating CLL.

The main purpose of this study is to compare the duration the participants live without the CLL getting worse between participants who received sonrotoclax plus zanubrutinib versus venetoclax plus obinutuzumab. Approximately 652 participants will be included in this study around the world. Participants will have equal chance to be allocated to receive either of the treatment combinations.
