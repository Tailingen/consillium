Study to Evaluate the Safety and Tolerability of ABL501, and to Determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of ABL501 in Subjects With Any Progressive, Locally Advanced (Unresectable) or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is a first-in-human (FIH) phase 1 open-label, multicenter, multiple-dose, dose-escalation and dose-expansion study of ABL501 to evaluate the safety, tolerability, MTD and/or RP2D, PK, immunogenicity, preliminary anti-tumor activity, and the PD effect of ABL501 in subjects with any progressive locally advanced (unresectable) or metastatic solid tumors. This study included 2 parts; a dose-escalation part and a dose expansion part.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: ABL501

Pharmacokinetic profile of ABL501, serum concentration of ABL501 will be collected and analyzed to evaluate the PK of ABL501, From Day 1 until confirmed CR, disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or subject/investigator's decision to terminate the study participation, assessed up to 24 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Proportion of subjects with best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST v1.1, From Day 1 until confirmed CR, disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or subject/investigator's decision to terminate the study participation, assessed up to 24 months|number of subject with anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), Incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) will be analyzed to evaluate the immunogenicity of ABL501, From Day 1 until confirmed CR, disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or subject/investigator's decision to terminate the study participation, assessed up to 24 months
This is consisted with dose-escalation and dose-expansion study of ABL501 to evaluate the safety, tolerability, MTD and/or RP2D, PK, immunogenicity, anti-tumor activity, and the PD effect of ABL501 in subjects with any progressive locally advanced (unresectable) or metastatic solid tumors.
