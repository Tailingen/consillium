Human Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha (TNFa)-Induced Pre-B Cell Bone Marrow Emigrants
The purpose of the study is to determine the effects of TNF (tumor necrosis factor; a mediator of inflammation) on B cells in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. TNF and B cells are important in rheumatoid arthritis because they both appear to be involved in causing rheumatoid arthritis.
Rheumatoid Arthritis
DRUG: Etanercept
The primary objective of the study is to quantify early B cell bone marrow emigrants in the peripheral blood of adults with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) before and after etanercept therapy., 12 weeks
Secondary objectives will include granulocyte numbers, serum cytokine (CRP, IL-1β and TNFα) levels, rheumatoid arthritis disease activity and changes in anti-CCP and RF levels before and after etanercept therapy., 12 weeks
Primary Objective: The primary objective of the study is to identify early B cell bone marrow emigrants in the peripheral blood of adults with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) receiving etanercept.

Hypotheses: We believe that the peripheral blood of RA patients contain early B cell bone marrow emigrants. We believe that these early B cell bone marrow emigrants are induced by TNFα.

Primary Endpoint: The primary endpoint of the study is quantification of CD34+/CD19+ early B cell bone marrow emigrants in the peripheral blood of subjects.

Study Design: Open-label, One Arm, Phase IV study of 12 RA patients with active disease receiving etanercept.
