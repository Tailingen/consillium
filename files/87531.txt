Radioembolization for Hepatocellular Carcinoma With Portal Vein Tumoral Thrombosis
In patients with hgepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and portal vein tumoral thrombosis (PVTT), Sorafenib represents the treatment of choice but more recently, trans-arterial radioembolization (TARE) with yttrium-90 has been also proposed. A considerable percentage of such patients are not only able to achieve stability of the disease, but also to obtain a complete radiological response (CR). The possibility of achieving a CR might allow these patients to be listed for liver transplantation (LT), in order to cure not only the cancer but also the underlying cirrhosis that generated it.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
RADIATION: yttrium-90 radioembolization
Response to radioembolization, The primary endpoint of this study was to assess the effect of radioembolization in HCC patients with PVTT, 6 months
Overall survival, The secondary endpoint was overall survival (OS), 5 years|Progression-free survival, The secondary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), 5 years
