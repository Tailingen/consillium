Perfusion CT Monitoring to Predict Treatment Efficacy in Renal Cell Carcinoma
This pilot clinical trial studies perfusion computed tomography (CT) in predicting response to treatment in patients with advanced kidney cancer. Comparing results of diagnostic procedures done before, during, and after targeted therapy may help doctors predict a patient's response to treatment and help plan the best treatment.
Metastatic Renal Cell Cancer
DEVICE: perfusion computed tomography
Characterization of the relationship between Change in blood flow measured through perfusion CT techniques and Change in tumor size measured through non-investigational CT, 12 weeks (+/- 5 days) after start of standard systemic targeted therapy medication
Characterization of the relationship between change in perfusion CT measurements (eg. Mean transit time) and change in tumor size measured by non-investigational CT, 12 weeks (+/- 5 days) after start of standard systemic targeted therapy medication|Relationship between change in blood flow and tumor response measured on ordinal scale, 12 weeks (+/- 5 days) after start of standard systemic targeted therapy medication|Relationship between change in blood flow at Day 8 and change in tumor size measured on continuous scale at Week 12 and tumor response measured on ordinal scale at Week 12, 12 weeks (+/- 5 days) after start of standard systemic targeted therapy medication|Relationship between change in blood flow at Day 8 and at Week 12 and progression-free survival, 12 weeks after start of standard systemic targeted therapy medication|Relationship between change in blood flow at Day 8 and at Week 12 and time to nadir of tumor size, 12 weeks after start of standard systemic targeted therapy medication
