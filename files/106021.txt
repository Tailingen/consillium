Lenalidomide for Myelodysplastic Syndrome Refractory to Hypomethylating Agents
The purpose of this study is to determine the proportion of confirmed responses (complete response, partial response, and hematologic improvement as defined by revised IWG criteria during the 12 months of treatment.
Myelodysplastic Syndromes
DRUG: Lenalidomide
Number of Participants With Confirmed Responses (Complete Remission, Partial Remission, or Hematologic Improvement) as Defined by the International Working Group Criteria, * Complete remission (CR): ≤5% myeloblasts bone marrow blasts, normal maturation in all cell lines (dysplasia will be noted), ≥11 g/dl peripheral blood hemoglobin, ≥100x10\^9cells/μL peripheral blood platelets, ≥1000 cells/ μL peripheral blood absolute neutrophil count (ANC), and 0% peripheral blood blasts.
* Marrow complete remission (MCR): ≤5% myeloblasts and decreased by ≥50% compared to pre-treatment bone marrow blasts, bone marrow morphology not relevant, and peripheral blood (if hematological improvement they will be noted in addition to marrow CR).
* Partial remission (PR): previously had ≥5% myeloblasts and now have ≥5% myeloblasts but decreased by ≥50% compared to pre-treatment, bone marrow morphology not relevant, ≥11 g/dl peripheral blood hemoglobin, ≥100x109cells/μL peripheral blood platelets, ≥1000 cells/ μL peripheral blood ANC, and 0% peripheral blood blasts, Up to 56 weeks (14 cycles of treatment)
Overall Survival Rate, -Overall survival rate is the percentage of participants who were alive 6 months after end of treatment., 6 months after end of treatment (up to 82 weeks from start of treatment)|Duration of Response, Until 6 months after end of treatment|Time to Discontinuation of Treatment, Up to 56 weeks (14 cycles)|Toxicity as Measured by Number of Participants Who Experienced Related Grade 3-5 Adverse Events Based on CTCAE Version 4, 30 days after end of treatment (up to 60 weeks)|Time to Progression, The time to progression is defined as the time from registration to the date of progression or last follow-up. Those who die will be considered to have had disease progression unless documented evidence clearly indicates no progression has occurred., Up to 6 months after completion of treatment (up to 82 weeks from start of treatment)
The purpose of this study is to determine the proportion of confirmed responses (complete response, partial response, and hematologic improvement as defined by revised IWG criteria during the 12 months of treatment.
