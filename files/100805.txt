Omega-3 Hydrogel and Prevention of Oral Mucositis
Oral mucositis (OM) is recognized as one of the most frequent debilitating sequela encountered by head and neck cancer (HNC) patients treated by radiotherapy. The objective of the study is to assess primarily the effect of topical oral Omega-3 hydrogel in prevention of radiation-induced oral mucositis and secondarily, to test the effect of topical oral Omega-3 hydrogel on oral microbiome.
