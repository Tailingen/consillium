Study of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy in Patients With Intact Pancreatic Cancer
This purpose of this study is to determine the highest tolerated dose of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) and also to determine the appropriate dose for intact pancreatic cancer.
Pancreatic Cancer
RADIATION: Stereotactic Radiation
Maximum Tolerated Dose (phase 1), Side effects will be assessed after 28 days of treatment to determine tolerability of the dose of radiation., 28 days|Identify the appropriate dose for treatment of unresected carcinoma of the ampulla or pancreas, 28 days
Reported side effects, 12 months after treatment|Change in patient reported pain score using visual analog scale, Using the visual analog scale, patients rate pain from 1-10 with higher scores indicate greater pain intensity., 12 months after treatment|Number of patients eligible for surgery to remove tumor after treatment, 12 months after treatment|Number of patients with disease control, Number of patients with no disease progression as measured by tumor imaging, 12 months after treatment|Change in patient reported outcomes using FACT-Hepatobiliary (FACT-Hep) quality of life questionnaire., 12 months after treatment
This purpose of this study is to determine the highest tolerated dose of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) and also to determine the appropriate dose for intact pancreatic cancer.
