A Multicenter Real-world Clinical Study on the Efficacy and Safety of Ensartinib As Neoadjuvant Treatment for Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) Positive Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Patients.
Explore the efficacy and safety of Ensartinib in neoadjuvant treatment for ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer in the real world.This is a real-world study of patients receiving enshatinib-based neoadjuvant therapy with R0 resection, divided into retrospective cohort 1, prospective cohort 2, and prospective cohort 3. The dose, duration, and whether to combine or sequentially treat enshatinib were clinical decisions made by the investigator on a patient-specific basis.
