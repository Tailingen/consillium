Study of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) Versus Placebo in Participants With Esophageal Carcinoma Who Are Receiving Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy (MK-3475-975/KEYNOTE-975)
The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of treatment with definitive chemoradiotherapy (dCRT) + pembrolizumab (MK-3475) compared to treatment with dCRT + placebo with respect to Event-free Survival (EFS) and Overall Survival (OS) in:

* participants whose tumors express Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) Combined Positive Score (CPS) ≥10
* participants whose tumors express PD-L1 CPS ≥1
* all participants

The primary study hypotheses are that dCRT+ pembrolizumab is better than dCRT + placebo with respect to:

* EFS in participants whose tumors express PD-L1 CPS ≥10
* EFS in participants whose tumors express PD-L1 CPS ≥1
* EFS in all participants
* OS in participants whose tumors express PD-L1 CPS ≥10
* OS in participants whose tumors express PD-L1 CPS ≥1
* OS in all participants

BIOLOGICAL: pembrolizumab|DRUG: placebo|DRUG: cisplatin|DRUG: 5-FU|RADIATION: radiotherapy|DRUG: leucovorin|DRUG: levoleucovorin|DRUG: oxaliplatin
Event-free Survival (EFS), EFS is defined as the time from randomization to an event defined as local, regional, or distant radiological recurrence as assessed by the investigator; clinical recurrence as assessed by the investigator with histopathologic confirmation (in the absence of radiological disease recurrence by investigator assessment); or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to ~60 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause., Up to ~72 months
Number of participants with an adverse event (AE), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant that is temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment., Up to ~15 months|Number of participants discontinuing study treatment due to an adverse event (AE), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant that is temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment., Up to ~12 months
Participants receive pembrolizumab or placebo PLUS one of two chemotherapy regimens PLUS radiation therapy for up to approximately one year. The chemotherapy regimens are either:

* FP (5-fluorouracil \[5-FU\] + cisplatin) or
* FOLFOX (5-FU + oxaliplatin + leucovorin or levoleucovorin).
