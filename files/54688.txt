JS001 in Combination With RC48-ADC in Treatment of HER2-Positive Advanced Malignant Solid Tumors
This is a non-randomized, open-label, single-arm, multicenter Phase I clinical trial which will evaluate the Safety, Efficacy, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of RC48-ADC in combinaton with Anti-PD1 Monoclonal Antibody in Treatment of HER2-Positive Advanced Malignant Solid Tumors.
HER2-Positive Solid Tumors
BIOLOGICAL: RC48-ADC in combinaton with JS001
DLT(dose-limiting toxicity) or Maximal Tolerance Dose (MTD), Side effects of drug or treatment that are serious enough to prevent an increase in dose or level of that treatment. The MTD is defined as the previous dose level., 28 days|adverse events, Safety of participants followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 1 week, 1 year
ORR, Percentage of patients who achieve partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) based on Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1)., From date of first dose until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months|DOR, The percentage of patients who achieve complete remission(CR) or partial remission, From date of first dose until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months|PFS, progression free survival, up to 2 years|OS, overall survival, up to 2 years|ADA, anti-drug antibody which can result in treatment failure by blocking the pharmacological function of the drug., up to 2 years|NADA, neutralizing anti-drug antibody which can result in treatment failure by blocking the pharmacological function of the drug., up to 2 years|Cmax, Peak plasma concentration, up to 3 cycles(each cycle is 14 days)|AUC, area under the plasma concentration versus time curve, up to 3 cycles(each cycle is 14 days)|Tmax, Time for peak concentration, up to 3 cycles(each cycle is 14 days)
The study has 2 parts which include dose escalation phase and dose extension phase.

Dose escalation will use a 3+3 design and will enroll cohorts of 3-6 patients with HER2-Positive Advanced Malignant Solid Tumors sequentially at escalating doses of 2.0mg/kg and 2.5mg/kg to RC48-ADC and JS001 is fixed dose of 3.0mg/mg . Escalation will continue until identification of a MTD.

Dose of phase II and extenstion stage which based-results of escalation phase will be recommend.
