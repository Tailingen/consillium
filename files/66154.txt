Study of Pazopanib and Pemetrexed in Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
The main purpose of this study is to determine whether the combination of pazopanib and pemetrexed is safe and effective in the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Lung Cancer, Non-Small Cell
DRUG: pazopanib and pemetrexed|DRUG: pemetrexed and cisplatin
Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the interval between the date of randomization (date on which the investigator evaluated the participant and first determined he/she had disease progression) and the first occurrence of progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause. Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1, PD is defined as a \>=20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of \>=1 new lesion)., Randomization until progression or death (up to 85 weeks)
Overall Survival (OS), OS was determined from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause. Participants who had not died at the time of the cut-off for the final analysis were censored at the date the participants were last known to be alive. Because enrollment in the study was halted prematurely, the ability to achieve an estimate of OS was compromised. Consequently, OS was not estimated., Randomization until death (up to 85 weeks)|Best Overall Response, Assessed as the Number of Participants With the Indicated Tumor Response: Investigator Assessed Only, Tumor response was assessed by the Investigator according to the RECIST, version 1.0. A participant was defined as a responder if he/she sustained a complete response (CR; the disappearance of all target lesions) or partial response (PR; \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions) for at least 4 weeks at any time during randomized treatment. Stable disease is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter since the treatment started., Randomization until response or progressive disease (up to 85 weeks)|Percentage of Participants With a Complete Response or a Partial Response, The percentage of participants with a complete response or a partial response was evaluated., Randomization until response or progressive disease (up to 85 weeks)
The main purpose of this study is to determine whether the combination of pazopanib and pemetrexed is safe and effective in the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
