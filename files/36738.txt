Comparison of Radiation Therapy Regimens in Combination With Chemotherapy in Treating Young Patients With Newly Diagnosed Standard-Risk Medulloblastoma
This randomized phase III trial is studying how well standard-dose radiation therapy works compared to reduced-dose radiation therapy in children 3-7 years of age AND how well standard volume boost radiation therapy works compared to smaller volume boost radiation therapy when given together with chemotherapy in treating young patients who have undergone surgery for newly diagnosed standard-risk medulloblastoma. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as vincristine, cisplatin, lomustine, and cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving radiation therapy with chemotherapy after surgery may kill any remaining tumor cells. It is not yet known whether standard-dose radiation therapy is more effective than reduced-dose radiation therapy when given together with chemotherapy after surgery in treating young patients with medulloblastoma.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To determine whether reducing the craniospinal dose of radiation therapy to 18.00 Gy in children 3-7 years of age does not compromise event-free survival and overall survival as compared to treatment with 23.40 Gy of craniospinal radiation; and to determine if reducing the irradiated volume of the primary site tumor boost from the whole posterior fossa to the tumor bed only will not compromise event-free and overall survival.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate patterns of failure in children treated with an irradiation boost volume smaller than conventional posterior fossa volumes.

II. To reduce the cognitive, auditory and endocrinologic effects of treatment of average-risk medulloblastoma by reducing the dose of craniospinal irradiation therapy.

III. To determine if the audiologic and endocrinologic toxicity will be reduced with the use of limited tumor boost volume irradiation compared to patients treated with conventional target volumes of radiation.

IV. To develop an optimal gene expression medulloblastoma outcome predictor, validated prospectively in a multi-institution randomized clinical trial.

V. To improve compliance with long-term quality of life and functional status data submission by educating institutional nurses to administer and submit for analysis a battery of four instruments: Behavior Assessment System for Children- 2nd Edition (BASC-2), Adaptive Behavior Assessment System - 2nd Edition (ABAS-II), Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF), PedsQLTM 4.0.

Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.
