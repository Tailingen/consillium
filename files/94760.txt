Peripheral vs. Selective Tumor Marker Venous Sampling in Prostate Cancer
The investigators will compare tumor marker levels, including PSA, in samples taken from a peripheral upper limb vein and the internal iliac veins. These will be collected from patients who are scheduled for prostatectomy as part of their standard of care for prostate cancer. A selective internal iliac vein sampling procedure will be performed in Interventional Radiology. Venous samples will be correlated with prostatectomy specimens. The aim is to predict the side of the prostate containing tumor.
