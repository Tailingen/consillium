An Observational Clinical Study Plan on the Effects of Radiotherapy on the Immune System of Patients With Malignant Tumors.
To explore the impact of radiotherapy on peripheral blood myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), T cells and extramedullary erythroid precursor cells in patients with malignant tumors, and to evaluate the correlation between changes in the proportion of these cells before and after radiotherapy and the efficacy of radiotherapy in patients.

To clarify the impact of radiotherapy (and/or other treatment combinations) on the proportion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), T cells and extramedullary erythroid precursor cells in the peripheral blood of patients with malignant tumors, and to evaluate the changes in the proportion of these cells before and after radiotherapy and the relationship between the patients Correlation with the efficacy of radiotherapy. On this basis, it provides theoretical guidance for the determination of new clinical treatment plans.
