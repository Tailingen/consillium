Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Breast Cancer
This is a prospective, single institution, phase I-II study of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for unresected breast cancer. Twenty-four patients with advanced breast cancer who are not candidates for surgery (metastatic disease, unresectable, medically inoperable) or decline surgery will be enrolled in a prospective study using SBRT (4 fractions of radiation therapy over 12-15 days) as the primary treatment modality.
