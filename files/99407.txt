A Phase III Clinical Trial of a 11-valent Recombinant Human Papillomavirus Vaccine (Hansenulapolymorpha) in Chinese Women Aged 9-45 Years
A total of 13500 Chinese women aged 18-45 years old were divided into three age groups: 18-26 years old, 27-35 years old, and 35-45 years old. The experimental group and the placebo group were randomly assigned in a ratio of 1:1. All subjects enrolled in the upper arm deltoid muscle were injected with 3 doses of test vaccine or placebo according to the 0, 2, and 6 months immunization program.
