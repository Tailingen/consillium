The Effect of Berries on Lung Cancer Tumors
The purpose of this study is to determine how berries affect cancer tumors in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: berry powder
Assessment of blueberry and black raspberry phenolics in plasma and urine, In addition to determining the berry phytochemical profile in plasma and urine, this study will attempt to establish the effect of berries on modulating immunological profiles such as the complete blood count, and T, B and natural killer (NK) cell populations and circulating biomarkers (serum proteins and microRNAs). This pilot study will establish the safety and feasibility of conducting a larger clinical trial with berry intervention., upon completion of 4 to 5 weeks of daily consumption of berry powder
In the United States, more people (161,840 per year) die of lung cancers than of prostate cancer, breast cancer and colon cancer combined. Presently, there are over 43 million current smokers and over 47 million ex-smokers living in the US. Due to the lag time between smoking and the development of cancer, there are significant numbers of ex-smokers and current smokers who may develop lung cancer compared to never smokers.

Recent studies in animals have shown that berries, given as a dietary supplement, are highly effective against certain types of cancers. In a study involving mice with lung tumors, mice that had consumed a mixture of berries developed fewer tumors and had less tumor growth than mice that did not consume berries.

The berries used in this study will consist of blueberries, black raspberries, or a mixture of both.
