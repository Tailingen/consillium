SHOX2_PTGER4 DNA Methlyation in Lung Cancer
Data on SHOX2 and PTGER4 DNA Methylation suggest possible use as a biomarker for early lung cancer diagnosis.

In this study a control group consisting of COPD patients with a CT-scan of the chest no older than 6 weeks and a control group of patients with a nodule and ruled out diagnosis of lung cancer will be included.

SHOX2 and PTGER4 will be analyzed via PCR.

DNA Methylation at early stages of lung cancer, 1 year
Data on SHOX2 and PTGER4 DNA Methylation suggest possible use as a biomarker for early lung cancer diagnosis.

In this study a control group consisting of COPD patients with a CT-scan of the chest no older than 6 weeks and a control group of patients with a nodule and ruled out diagnosis of lung cancer will be included.

A total of 150 patients will be enrolled in this study. SHOX2 and PTGER4 will be analyzed via PCR of blood plasma samples.
