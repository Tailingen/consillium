Preoperative Chemoradiation for Glioblastoma
Trial to determine the safety of neoadjuvant treatment with concurrent temozolomide and radiation therapy, followed by surgery and then further temozolomide.
Glioblastoma
DRUG: Temozolomide|RADIATION: partial brain irradiation|PROCEDURE: stereotactic biopsy of brain tumor|PROCEDURE: craniotomy and tumor resection
toxicity of treatment per Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects V3.0, comparison of toxicity related to experimental treatment to historical local controls, up to up to 16 weeks
Feasibility of measurement of O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) activity on stereotactic samples, determination of the feasibility of using standard MGMT activity measurement techniques on stereotactic specimens and comparison of the results with the results from the full resection., at enrollment|progression free survival, up to 12 months|overall survival, up to 12 months
Prior to any definitive treatment and after enrollment, the patient will undergo stereotactic biopsy of the lesion to confirm the histology of the lesion and to determine methylated methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) status. Standard image-guided stereotactic technique will be used. Patients will be treated with conformal radiation therapy. Temozolomide will be given from the day prior to radiation therapy through the last day of radiation therapy. 4-6 weeks after radiation therapy the patient will undergo craniotomy and maximal safe resection. Temozolomide will continue beginning 4 weeks after surgery.

Imaging:

MRI within 2 weeks prior to the start of the protocol. MRI at 4 weeks after chemoradiation therapy and prior to surgery. MRI within 48 hours after surgery.

MRI after every 2 cycles of chemotherapy and then every 2 months until progression, up to 2 years.
