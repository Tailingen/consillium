Clinical Prediction Thyroid Cancer With Thyroid Ultrasonography
Iodine ingestion insufficiency was widespread existence in the 50's in Taiwan, induced the hypothyroidism with the popular name "the big neck". After many experts study and evaluation, goiter was gradually disappeared after salt adding iodine in the 60's. But the nodule of the thyroid gland was widespread on the Taiwan island. This situation was a particular victim in living in the mountainous area inhabitant. The middle area populaces suffer from the thyroid gland disease really popular than other areas. Recently literature reported that the cancer rate of thyroid gland rises gradually. In according to the statistics, thyroid cancer prevalence probably has 10% in the nodular goiter.

The major early preliminary diagnosis of the thyroid cancer is thyroid fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC), but this technique must to have skilled clinical puncture's doctor and to have special training cytological pathology doctor. Therefore, if we can have simple fast screening tool and can make up this insufficiency, then we can achieved the fast diagnosis, rapid processing, the promotion diagnosis and treatment quality and promotes the survival percentage. The thyroid ultrasonography (Thyroid US) is one universal, fast, cheap, and the simple diagnosis nodular goiter tool. If we can friendly use this tool, we can early diagnosis \& management this disease.

This research collect subjects from Jan 2002 to Dec 2016 under procedure of thyroid US, FNAC and thyroidectomy. Preliminary design index of thyroid gland tumor score (TTS) was to survey and analysis.
