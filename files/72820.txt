Bortezomib/Dexamethasone (BD), Followed By Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation and Maintenance Bortezomib/Dexamethasone For the Initial Treatment of Monoclonal Immunoglobulin Deposition Disease (MIDD) Associated With Multiple Myeloma and AL Amyloidosis
The goal of this clinical trial is to determine the toxicity and also the efficacy of a treatment that includes the following treatment: Two medications, bortezomib and dexamethasone (or BD), followed by autologous stem cell transplantation, and a prolonged course of treatment with bortezomib and dexamethasone after transplantation. This type of treatment has been very effective in multiple myeloma. However, there is little experience with this treatment in patients who have Monoclonal Immunoglobulin Deposition Disease (MIDD) or amyloidosis. The investigators and others have treated patients who have MIDD and amyloidosis with bortezomib and autologous stem cell transplantation and have had success with this treatment. But the combination of autologous transplant with BD given before and after the transplant is a new way of treating these diseases, which the investigators believe will be very effective.
