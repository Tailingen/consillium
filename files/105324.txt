A Study to Test the Safety and Effectiveness of GSK5764227, Alone or With Other Treatments, in Participants With Advanced Gastrointestinal Cancers That Cannot be Surgically Removed
This study will check how well a new medicine, GSK5764227, works, how safe it is and how the body handles it in participants all around the world with advanced inoperable or metastatic gastrointestinal cancer who have previously received treatment.

Confirmed Objective Response Rate (ORR), Confirmed ORR is defined as the proportion of participants who have achieved best overall response (BOR) of confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as assessed by investigator, according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), Up to approximately 17 months
