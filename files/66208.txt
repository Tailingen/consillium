Positron Emission Tomography / Magnetic Resonance Imaging (PET/MRI) Guided Biopsy in Men With Elevated PSA
In 22% of patients with elevated Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) MRI guided biopsy will not detect significant prostate cancer (PCA) (defined as either: Gleason score (GS) ≥ 3+4 or tertiary pattern 5, or final stage ≥ pT3a and/or pN1). Therefore this study evaluates the ability of \[68Ga\]PSMA PET/MRI to detect and localize significant primary PCA to accurately direct prostate needle biopsy using the Gleason score from the histology of the core biopsies as standard of truth.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: [68Ga]PSMA-11|DRUG: [18F]PSMA-1007
Rate of positive histopathology for [68Ga]PSMA-11 positive lesions, PCA detection of PET/MRI versus mpMRI based on histopathology per patient and per prostate section., 7 months
Correlation of [68Ga]PSMA-11 with tumor aggressiveness, Correlation of stanadized uptake value (SUV) on \[68Ga\]PSMA-11 with Gleason Score on histopathology., 7 months
In this open label, single center, non-randomized, diagnostic study we plan to include 40 men with elevated PSA (ages 30-50 PSA \>2.5 ng/mL; ages 50-80 PSA \> 4ng/mL), which are assigned to a MRI guided biopsy.

These patients will undergo one additional PET/MRI scan with \[68Ga\]PSMA within two to three weeks before the biopsy (Arm A), or in case of an unclear/negative MRI scan but positive biopsy two to three weeks after biopsy (Arm B). In Arm A a radiologist will delineate the suspected areas on (A) multiparametric magnetic resonance image (mpMRI) and a nuclear medicine physician will delineate and color code the suspicious areas on the PET/MRI: (B) \[68Ga\]PSMA. The images will be loaded into the BiopSee® system. Lesions positive on both modalities will be labeled as "AB". Every suspicious lesion will be targeted with 3 cores. A maximum of 3 targets will be selected per patient.

For arm B: PET/MRI results will be correlated with the template biopsy results.

The data analysis of Arm A and Arm B will be identical. For the analysis the Gleason score from the histology of the core biopsies will serve as standard of truth.

After completion of the PET/MR study part - an amendment for PET/CT was submitted to the local ethics commity and acknowledged to include 10 more participants with PSMA PET/CT to investigate the use of PET/CT guided biopsy and intraoperative verivication of the target with a gamma counter.
