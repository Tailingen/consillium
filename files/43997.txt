Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Tolerance of TQB2210 Injection
TQB2210 injection is a humanized monoclonal antibody against FGFR2b, which can bind to FGFR2b with high specificity and inhibit tumor growth by blocking the signaling pathway mediated by fibroblast growth factor receptor. The aim of this experiment is to evaluate the tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of TQB2210 injection in patients with advanced malignant tumors, and to assess its effectiveness and phase II recommended dose (RP2D) in advanced malignant tumors with FGFR2b overexpression, such as advanced gastric/gastroesophageal junction cancer.
Advanced Malignant Tumours
DRUG: TQB2210 Injection
Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), DLT will be defined as toxicities that meet pre-defined severity criteria(according to the NCI CTCAE v5.0 toxicity assessment criteria), and assessed as having a suspected relationship to study drug that occurred within the first cycle(28 days) of treatment., During the first cycle. Each cycle is 28 days|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), MTD was defined as the highest dose at which dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) occurred in less than 33% of patients., During the first cycle. Each cycle is 28 days|Recommended Phase II Dose, The recommended dosage for subsequent Phase II studies will be based on MTD (Maximum Tolerant Dose), pharmacokinetics, preliminary efficacy and safety comprehensively determined., During the first cycle. Each cycle is 28 days|Objective Response Rate (ORR) (dose expansion phase), Defined as the percentage of Complete Response (CR) plus partial response (PR) assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 criteria., Up to 2 years
