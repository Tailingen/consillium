A Phase I Study to Evaluate the Safety,Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Efficacy of YL211 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1 study. The study will enroll subjects with advanced solid tumors. It consists of three parts. Part 1 is dose-escalation part. In part 1, the safety and tolerability of YL211 in patients with selected advanced solid tumors will be evaluated and the MTD and RED will be determined.

Part 2 is backfill enrollment part. We will further estimate the safety and efficacy of YL211 in patients with selected adcance tumor to select the RED(s) of YL211.

Part 3 is dose-expansion part. In this part, we will further evaluate the safety and efficacy of YL211 at the MTD/RED(s) in patients with selected advanced solid tumors YL211 will be administered intravenously (IV) until criteria of treatment discontinuation are met.
