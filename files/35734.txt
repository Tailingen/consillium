Curative Chemoradiation of Low Rectal Cancer
The aim of the present study is to investigate whether curative chemoradiation of low rectal cancer is feasible, safe and effective in a multicenter study with results comparable to those of single center studies.

Results from previous studies indicate that a considerable fraction of patients with low rectal cancer can be cured by a combination of radiation and chemotherapy alone and thus be spared from operation.
