Genomics and Prognosis in GI Cancers
This study aims to collect biospecimens and explore the correlation of genomics and prognosis in alimentary tract cancers.
GI Cancer|Liver Cancer
Number of subjects who still survive at 1 year, 1 year overall survival rate, 1 year
In this study, the investigators will collect clinical specimens of alimentary tract cancers and perform DNA and RNA analysis to identify genetic alterations for the development of a comprehensive somatic mutation databases and investigate their potential correlation with clinical, radiological and pathological variables. The genomics study included but not limited to target gene panel sequencing, whole exome sequencing, whole genome sequencing, bulk RNA sequencing, single cell RNA sequencing and metagenomics.
