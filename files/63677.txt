MR-HIFU for Recurrent Gynaecological Cancer
The primary objective of this pilot study is to determine whether or not it is feasible to use MRgHIFU to treat symptomatic (pain, bleeding) recurrent pelvic malignancy with an acceptable safety profile when conventional treatment options are not available. The ultimate goal is to be able not only to offer a viable method of symptom palliation in patients with recurrent pelvic tumours and improve their quality of life; but also to control tumour growth and extend life in a group of relatively young patients with isolated local recurrence.
