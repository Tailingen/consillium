Clinical Study of Nab-paclitaxel Combined With Toripalimab in Local Advanced or Metastatic G/GEJ Carcinoma
This study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Albumin-bound paclitaxel combined with Toripalimab as first-line/second-line treatment of local advanced or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction carcinoma.
Gastric Carcinoma
DRUG: Albumin-Bound Paclitaxel|DRUG: Toripalimab
PFS, * Progression-Free Survival
* Defined as the time from first dose of study medication to the first documented disease progression per RECIST version 1.1，or death from any cause, whichever occurred first, up to 24 months
ORR, * Objective Response Rate
* Defined as the proportion of patients with confirmed complete response /partial response per RECIST version 1.1, up to 24 months|DCR, * Disease control rate
* Defined as the proportion of patients with confirmed complete response /partial response/ Stable Disease per RECIST version 1.1, up to 24 months|OS, * Over survival
* Defined as the time from the date of first dose of study medication to the date of death from any cause, up to 24 months|Change in Quality of Life(QoL)：measured by EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire, * European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer's Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30)
* The change in the quality of life as measured by EORTC QLQ-C30, consists of 30 questions that provide a global QoL scale, five functional scales (physical, role-playing, emotional, cognitive, social), three symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain) and six individual factors (dyspnea, insomnia, loss of appetite, constipation, diarrhea, financial difficulties). The scores of each scale are calculated in a score ranging from 0 to 100. A high score on a functional scale represents a good level of function., up to 24 months|Adverse events, - Defined by National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0, up to 24 months
