A Study of Mesothelin-Targeted CAR T-Cell Therapy in People With Esophagogastric Cancer
Participants will have a sample of their white blood cells, called T cells, collected using a procedure called leukapheresis. The collected T cells will be sent to a laboratory at Memorial Sloan Kettering to be changed (modified) to become MSLN-targeted CAR T cells, the CAR T-cell therapy that participants will receive during the study. Participant study therapy will take about 3-4 weeks.

BIOLOGICAL: M28z1XXPD1DNR CAR
Number of treatment-emergent adverse events, The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety of M28z1XXPD1DNR CAR T cells administered through the peritoneal cavity. CTCAE v5.0 will be used to assess the severity of all treatment-emergent toxicities and adverse events, regardless of reporting requirements, 1 year|Maximum Tolerated Dose of M28z1XXPD1DNR CAR T cells, Determine the maximum tolerated dose of M28z1XXPD1DNR CAR T cells administered through the peritoneal cavity., Up to 1 year
