Adebrelimab and Fruquintinib Combined With Paclitaxel/Albumin Paclitaxel for Advanced Gastric Cancer After PD-1 Antibody Failed
This is a prospective, single-center, open, single-arm clinical study to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of Fruquintinib and Adebrelimab combined with paclitaxel/albumin paclitaxel for second-line treatment of advanced gastric cancer.

Since the first-line ICIs application of gastric cancer is mainly PD-1 antibody, this study intends to screen first-line patients exposed to PD-1 antibody and with long survival (PFS longer than 9 months) to receive second-line PD-L1 antibody for re-challenge and combine with Fruquintinib and paclitaxel to explore whether it can further increase the effect of second-line treatment.
