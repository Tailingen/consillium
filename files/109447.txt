Trial of Carfilzomib, Lenalidomide, Dexamethasone Versus Lenalidomide Alone After Stem-cell Transplant for Multiple Myeloma
This is a Phase 3 randomized trial of carfilzomib, lenalidomide, dexamethasone versus lenalidomide alone after stem-cell transplant for multiple myeloma, eligible to subjects who completed autologous stem cell transplant for symptomatic myeloma who are considered for lenalidomide maintenance.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Lenalidomide|DRUG: Carfilzomib|DRUG: Dexamethasone|DRUG: Lenalidomide (Control)
Progression free survival rates in participants receiving drug combination, Measurement of time to disease worsening as measured by International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) response criteria., 4 years
Rate of minimal residual negative disease (MRD) in participants receiving drug combination, Calculation of number of participants with MRD-negative disease., 3 years|Response rate in participants receiving drug combination, Number of participants with disease response (e.g. improvement) as measured by International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) response criteria., 3 years|Treatment-related side effects, Number of participants with grade 2 or greater treatment-related side effects as assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0, From date of screening until end of treatment
Primary Objective:

* To compare progression free survival between Kyprolis (Carfilzomib), Revlimid (lenalidomide), Dexamethasone (KRd) arm and lenalidomide arm

Secondary Objectives

* To determine the rate of minimal residual negative disease (MRD) at 6 and 12 months after randomization
* To compare the efficacy (rate of partial response, very good partial response, complete response, and stringent complete response) of KRd vs. Lenalidomide alone after randomization
