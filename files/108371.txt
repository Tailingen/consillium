68Ga FAPI PET/CT Evaluation of Axillary Lymph Node Status After Neoadjuvant Therapy in Patients With Clinical Axillary Lymph Node Positive Breast Cancer
The goal of this observational study is to learn whether 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT may be used as a new effective methods for evaluating axillary lymph node efficacy after neoadjuvant treatment for breast cancer. The main question it aims to answer is:

Could 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT effectively evaluate axillary lymph node after neoadjuvant treatment for breast cancer? Participants will have a 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT test between last neoadjuvant therapy and surgery.

Previous studies have shown that compared with conventional 18F-FDG PET/CT, 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT has the characteristics of not being affected by blood glucose, good tumor specificity, and high tumor-to-background ratio, and studies have shown that 68Ga- FAPI PET/CT can detect parts of breast cancer primary lesions and lymph node metastases with low 18F-FDG uptake, thereby increasing the lesion detection rate and improving the sensitivity of imaging examinations. Therefore, 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT may be used as a new effective methods for evaluating axillary lymph node efficacy after neoadjuvant treatment for breast cancer. Therefore, we plan to conduct this study to explore the ability of 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT to detect residual disease in axillary lymph nodes in patients with clinically positive axillary node (cN+) breast cancer after neoadjuvant treatment. By this way, we may explore an accurate and non-invasive assessment of axillary lymph node status after neoadjuvant therapy in breast cancer patients.
