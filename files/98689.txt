Tislelizumab and Induction Chemotherapy for Larynx Preservation in Resectable Advanced Laryngeal/Hypopharyngeal Cancer
This study is a prospective, single-arm, single-center, phase II study. The goal of this clinical trial is to explore the therapeutic value of the treatment model of "tislelizumab combined with chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy/adaptive surgery" on larynx Preservation of locally advanced hypopharyngeal cancer and laryngeal cancer.

Historical studies have shown that induction chemotherapy can provide an opportunity to preserve the larynx in approximately 60-70% of patients with locally advanced laryngeal/hypopharynx carcinoma. Recently, phase I-II clinical studies have shown that induction of PD-1 inhibitors has a good pathological response in locally advanced head and neck cancer, with or without combined chemotherapy. However,the primary lesion and lymph nodes respond asynchronously or even in the opposite way to immune induction therapy. The primary lesion is more likely to achieve CR/PR, while the lymph nodes are more likely to show PR/SD or even PD. Therefore, the surgical or radiotherapy plan should be implemented according to the specific response of the primary lesion and metastatic lymph nodes to induction therapy. This study aimed to determine whether the combination of induction chemotherapy with a PD-1 inhibitor (Tislelizumab) followed by chemoradiotherapy or adaptive surgery can improve the rate of laryngeal preservation in patients with resectable laryngeal/hypopharynx cancer.
