This study is designed to find the optimum radiation dose and number of cycles for an ABVD chemotherapy combined with an involved field irradiation. It is to be tested whether the reduction from 4 to 2 cycles of ABVD and/or the reduction of the radiation dose from 30 to 20 Gy is feasible without a loss of efficacy.
