Pembrolizumab and Trifluridine/Tipiracil With Previously Treated Advanced Gastric Cancer
This is a two-part, Phase II, open-label, single arm, multi-center study to determine the efficacy of pembrolizumab in combination with TAS-102 (trifluridine/tipiracil) in patients with advanced gastric cancer who have progressed after prior treatment with or without anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agent, and to further assess the safety and tolerability of this combination treatment.
Gastric and Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: Pembrolizumab (Keytruda®), Trifluridine/Tipiracil (Lonsurf®)
Phase Ib (DLT), Phase Ib (Lead-in safety cohort): Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), within first 6weeks|Phase Ib (RP2D), Phase Ib (Lead-in safety cohort): Recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), within first 6weeks|Objective response rate (ORR), The proportion of patients in complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR) among the best response (BOR) assessed by the investigator according to RECIST 1.1., 6months after the last treatment of the last subject
Overall survival (OS), Defined as the time start of study treatment until death by cause. Any subject not known to have died at the time of the analysis will be censored on the last recorded date on which the subject was known to be alive., 6months after the last treatment of the last subject|Progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed per RECIST 1.1, Defined as the time from start of study treatment until the date of objective disease progression or death. Progression is defined in accordance with RECIST v1.1 criteria., 6months after the last treatment of the last subject|Disease control rate (DCR) as assessed per RECIST 1.1, Defined as the proportion of subjects with a best objective response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or Partial response (PR), or stable disease maintained for a minium of twelve weeks from start of treatment, as defined by the RECIST 1.1., 6months after the last treatment of the last subject|Duration of response (DOR) as assessed per RECIST 1.1, Defined as the time from the investigator's first determination of objective response to the first of disease progression or death according to RECIST 1.1., 6months after the last treatment of the last subject|Number of participants with Adverse Events that are related to treatment, Safety and tolerability of the pembrolizumab and TAS-120 combination therapy as determined by adverse events categorized in accordance with CTCAE 5.0 Criteria., Throughout the overall trial period as well as up to 3months after the last dose study treatment for each subject
This is a two-part, Phase II, open-label, single arm, multi-center study to determine the efficacy of pembrolizumab in combination with TAS-102 (trifluridine/tipiracil) in patients with advanced gastric cancer who have progressed after prior treatment with or without anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agent, and to further assess the safety and tolerability of this combination treatment. In lead-in-safety cohort, recommended dose of trifluridine/tipiracil combined with pembrolizumab will be determined with dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and safety. Pembrolizumab dose will be fixed with current recommended dose of 400mg IV every 6 weeks (Q6W). There will be 2 dose cohort for trifluridine/tipiracil; dose level 1 is trifluridine/tipiracil 35mg/m2 BID, D1-5, D8-12, every 4 weeks (Q4W) and dose level 0 is trifluridine/tipiracil 30mg/m2 BID, D1-5, D8-12, every 4 weeks (Q4W). DLT will be evaluated during first 6 weeks. In the subsequent expansion Phase II part, patients will be recruited from four sites to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination therapy in 2 cohorts, anti-PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor naive and exposure cohorts.
