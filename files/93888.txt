Demeclocycline Fluorescence for Intraoperative Delineation Brain Tumors
This research study is studying a drug called Demeclocycline that may help brain surgeons see tumors with a microscope during surgery.
Brain Tumor
DRUG: Demeclocycline
Detectable fluorescence in brain tumors by confocal microscopy after oral dosing of demeclocycline (Y/N)., Detectable fluorescence via confocal microscopy, 2 years
Sensitivity And Specificity Of Demeclocycline-Enhanced Multimodal Confocal Microscopy of Excised Glioma Specimens, We aim to measure the sensitivity and specificity with which tumors can be diagnosed accurately after satisfactory detection of fluorescence, 2 years
This research study is a Feasibility Study, which is the first time investigators are examining this study intervention.The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Demeclocycline for your specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.

In this research study, the investigators would like to determine the lowest dose of Demeclocycline that will allow surgeons to detect tumor cells during surgery. These cells will be marked through a process called fluorescence, which will cause tumor cells to glow brightly on an image in comparison to its surroundings.
