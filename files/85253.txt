Safety Study of Regorafenib and SIR-Spheres® Microspheres Radioembolization in Patients With Refractory Metastatic Colorectal Cancer With Liver Metastases
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of regorafenib, an antiangiogenic drug, when combined with radioembolization using SIR-Spheres® microspheres in the treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC) that has spread to the liver.
Colorectal Neoplasms
DEVICE: SIR-Spheres|DRUG: Regorafenib
The Number of Participants With Treatment-Related Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety, A treatment-related adverse event or serious adverse event was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant which was considered to have a relationship with the study drug (suspected to be possibly or probably related to the study drug per the Investigator's assessment). Adverse events and serious adverse events will be assessed according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) V4.03., up to 15 months
Number of Patients With an Objective Response (CR or PR), Defined as the number of patients with objective evidence of complete or partial response (CR or PR) using RECIST v 1.1. A CR is the complete disappearance of all target lesions. A PR is a decrease in of 30% or more of the diameter(s) of all target lesions from the baseline sum of diameters., At 6 and 12 weeks after SIR-Spheres, and every 8 weeks thereafter, up to 18 months|Median Progression-Free Survival, Defined as the time (in months) from date of randomization to the date of first observation of progression based on radiological assessment by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v 1.1, or date of death from any cause, in the absence of progressive disease (PD) or censored at the date of last adequate tumor assessment. Progressive Disease is defined by RECIST v1.1 as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest (nadir) sum while on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study), or the appearance of one or more new lesions., At 6 and 12 weeks after SIR-Spheres, and every 8 weeks thereafter, up to 18 months.|Median Overall Survival, Defined as the time (in months) from date of randomization to date of death from any cause, or censored at the date last known alive., up to 18 months
Recent targeted therapies and treatment strategies have shown promise in colorectal cancer; however, elimination of disease remains a challenge once spread to the liver. Radioembolization using SIR-Spheres® microspheres (SIR-Spheres) to treat liver-only or liver-dominant metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) has been successful in this refractory setting. In this open-label study we will compare the safety of two treatment cohorts in which radioembolization will be administered using the device SIR-Spheres microspheres (90Y resin microspheres) in combination with regorafenib to patients with mCRC with liver metastases. The two treatment cohorts will be evaluated for safety, overall response (OR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).
