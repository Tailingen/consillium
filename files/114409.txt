Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Oligo-recurrent Prostate Cancer in Addition to radioTherapy
The overall aim of this project is to test the hypothesis that the addition of ADT to metastasis-directed radiotherapy (MDRT) in well-selected PCa patients with oligo-metastatic disease prolongs the metastases progression-free survival (MPFS) compared to MDRT alone.
