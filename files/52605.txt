iCare4: Genomic Signatures With Midostaurin in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (UF-HEM-004)
This is an open label, single arm study of midostaurin in patients with relapsed or refractory AML.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Midostaurin|DRUG: Cytarabine
Progression Free Survival, Compare the progression free survival of patients receiving midostaurin and cytarabine to that historically achieved in patients receiving cytarabine alone, Up to 6 months
Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology for Adverse Events(CTCAE) v4.0, Assess the incidence and severity of toxicities of midostaurin and cytarabine using CTCAE v4.0, Up to 2.5 years|Overall survival, Compare the overall survival of patients receiving midostaurin and cytarabine to that historically achieved in patients receiving cytarabine alone, Up to 3.5 years|Morphologic response rate, Compare the morphologic response rate (using International Working Group 2003 criteria) of patients receiving midostaurin and cytarabine to that historically achieved in patients receiving cytarabine alone, Up to 6 months
Clinical trials have shown that the multi-kinase inhibitor midostaurin improves survival in patients with AML. The main objective of this study is to investigate its effect (in conjunction with cytarabine) on progression free survival, as well as overall survival and morphologic response rate in patients with relapsed or refractory AML. This study will also attempt to identify specific populations of patients with relapsed or refractory AML who best respond to treatment with midostaurin to enhance treatment planning.
