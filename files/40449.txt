Phase 3 Trial of Litx™ Plus Chemotherapy vs. Chemotherapy Only Treating Colorectal Cancer Patients With Recurrent Liver Metastases
The purpose of the study is to assess the overall survival and progression free survival of patients treated with Litx™ + chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone in the treatment of Colorectal Cancer with recurrent liver metastases, and to demonstrate the safety of Litx™ therapy.

Litx™ consists of a light-activated drug, talaporfin sodium (LS11, Light Sciences Oncology, Bellevue, Washington), and a light generating device, composed of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), that is energized by a power controller and percutaneously placed in the target tumor tissue inside the body.
Liver Metastases|Colorectal Neoplasms|Neoplasm Metastasis|Neoplasm Recurrence, Local
DRUG: Talaporfin sodium|PROCEDURE: Percutaneous placement of device in liver metastases|DEVICE: Interstitial light emitting diodes|DRUG: FOLFOX4 regimen|DRUG: FOLFIRI regimen
Overall Survival, Time from randomization to death, Up to 184 weeks
Randomized, stratified, two arm study:

* Litx™ and chemotherapy arm (FOLFOX4 or FOLFIRI)
* Chemotherapy only arm (FOLFOX4 or FOLFIRI)

For patients who have progressed on FOLFIRI, they will be treated with Litx™ plus FOLFOX4 versus FOLFOX4 alone; and for patients who have progressed on FOLFOX, they will be treated with Litx™ plus FOLFIRI versus FOLFIRI alone.

Stratification upon enrollment by chemotherapy and tumor sum of the longest diameter (SLD) (SLD \< 4 cm or SLD ≥4 cm but ≤7.5 cm).
