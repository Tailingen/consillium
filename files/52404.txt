Urokinase Plasminogen Activator Receptor in Abiraterone Treated Patients With Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to investigate cleavage products of the urokinase plasminogenactivator receptor (uPAR) in plasma from patients with castration resistant prostate cancer as a predictive marker of response to abiraterone.
