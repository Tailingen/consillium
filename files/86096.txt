A Study of Contrast-Enhanced Mammography (CEM) Scans in People With Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to find out whether Contrast-Enhanced Mammography/CEM scans performed 2 minutes and 6 minutes after receiving Iohexol contrast dye can be used to identify the amount of residual disease in the breast following neoadjuvant treatment.
