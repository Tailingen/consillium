The VAS component rates current health state on a scale from 0 mm (worst imaginable health state) to 100 mm (best imaginable health state); higher scores indicate a better health state., Baseline, Cycle 46 (Cycle length=2 and 3 weeks)|Change From Baseline in EQ-5D-VAS Score at End of Study, EQ-5D: participant rated questionnaire to assess health-related QoL in terms of a single index value. The VAS component rates current health state on a scale from 0 mm (worst imaginable health state) to 100 mm (best imaginable health state); higher scores indicate a better health state., Baseline, end of study (4-6 weeks after the last bevacizumab infusion) (maximum up to 5 years and 9 months)
Percentage of Participants Who Died Due to Any Cause, Baseline up to death (overall approximately 5 years and 9 months)|Overall Survival, Overall survival was defined as the time from start of taxane plus bevacizumab therapy to death due to any cause. Overall survival was calculated in months as (date of death from any cause - date of first administration of taxane or bevacizumab + 1) / 30.4375 and rounded to 1 decimal place. Participants for whom no death was captured on the clinical database were censored at the last date they were known to be alive., Baseline up to death (overall approximately 5 years and 9 months)|Percentage of Participants With Disease Progression, Disease progression was defined as greater than or equal to (\>/=) 20 percent (%) relative increase and \>/=5 mm of absolute increase in the sum of diameters (SD) of target lesions (TLs), taking as reference the smallest SD recorded since treatment started, or appearance of 1 or more new lesions., Baseline up to disease progression (overall approximately 5 years and 9 months)|Time to Disease Progression, Time to disease progression was defined as the time from the start of taxane plus bevacizumab therapy to investigator assessed disease progression and was calculated in months as (date of Investigator assessed disease progression - date of first administration of taxane or bevacizumab + 1) / 30.4375 and rounded to 1 decimal place. Participants who had not progressed at the time of study completion (including participants who had died before progressive disease) or who were lost to follow-up were censored at the last bevacizumab administration date. Disease progression was defined as \>/=20% relative increase and \>/=5 mm of absolute increase in the SD of TLs, taking as reference the smallest SD recorded since treatment started, or appearance of 1 or more new lesions., Baseline up to disease progression (overall approximately 5 years and 9 months)|Percentage of Participants By Karnofsky Performance Status Scale Scores, Karnofsky performance score is used to quantify participant's general well-being and activities of daily life and participants are classified based on their functional impairment. Karnofsky performance score is 11 level score which range between 0% (death) to 100% (no evidence of disease). Higher score means higher ability to perform daily tasks., Baseline, Cycle 1 thereafter every cycle up to Cycle 47 (Cycle length=2 and 3 weeks), end of study (4-6 weeks after the last bevacizumab infusion) (maximum up to 5 years and 9 months)
This open-label, multi-center study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and effect of bevacizumab (Avastin) in combination with taxane (paclitaxel/ docetaxel) monotherapy on disease progression, survival time and Karnofsky performance status in female participants with estrogen-, progesterone- and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative (triple-negative) breast cancer.
