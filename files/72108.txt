Acalabrutinib in Combination With R-ICE For Relapsed or Refractory Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to test a combination treatment of acalabrutunib when given together with rituximab-ifosfamide-carboplatin-etoposide (R-ICE) to evaluate if it will be able to improve durable responses and cure some patients.
Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma|Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Small Lymphocytic Leukemia|Marginal Zone Lymphoma
DRUG: Acalabrutinib|DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Ifosfamide|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Etoposide
Percentage of Participants Achieving Complete Response (CR), The percentage of participants achieving complete response (CR) will be assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Lymphoma (RECIL 2017) criteria., 9 weeks (End of Cycle 3)
Number of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, The safety profile and tolerability of acalabrutinib + R-ICE will be reported as the number of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) or abnormalities of laboratory tests; serious adverse events (SAEs); dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), or AEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment, or death. Severity and relationship will be assessed by the treating physician using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 5.0., 13 weeks|Percentage of Participants Achieving Partial Response (PR), The percentage of participants achieving partial response (PR) will be assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Lymphoma (RECIL 2017) criteria., 9 weeks|Percentage of Participants Achieving Overall Response, Overall response is defined as the percentage of participants who achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) to acalabrutinib + R-ICE therapy. Response will be assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Lymphoma (RECIL 2017) criteria., 9 weeks|Percentage of Participants Achieving Mobilization Rate Greater Than or Equal to 2x10^6 CD34+ Cells/kg Body Weight, Percentage of study participants achieving a mobilization rate of greater than or equal to 2x10\^6 CD34+ cells/kg body weight. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the mobilization rates., 9 weeks|Event-Free Survival (EFS), Duration of Event-Free Survival (EFS) in study participants. EFS is defined as the time from first dose to documented disease progression, death from any cause, or study dropout, whichever occurs first., Up to 61 weeks|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Duration of Progression-Free Survival (PFS) in study participants. PFS is defined as the time from first dose to documented disease progression, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Data for subjects who are still alive and free from progression at the time of data cutoff date, lost to follow-up, or have discontinued the study will be censored on last assessment (or, if no post-baseline tumor assessment, at the time of first dose plus 1 day)., Up to 61 weeks|Overall Survival (OS), Duration of Overall Survival (OS) in study participants. OS is defined as the time from first dose to death from any cause. Data for subjects who are still alive at the time of data cutoff date, lost to follow-up, have discontinued the study (or, if no post-baseline assessment, at the time of first dose plus 1 day) will be censored., Up to 61 weeks
