A Study in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
This trial is testing ramucirumab (LY3009806) administered to Chinese participants with advanced solid tumors that are resistant to standard therapy or for whom no standard therapy is available. The purpose of this study is to evaluate how safe ramucirumab is and whether it causes any side effects. The study will also measure how much ramucirumab gets into the blood stream and how long it takes the body to get rid of it.
Solid Tumor
BIOLOGICAL: Ramucirumab
Number of Participants With One or More Drug-Related Adverse Events (AEs) or Any Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), A summary of AEs and SAEs considered by the investigator to be drug-related is located in the Reported Adverse Events module. An AE is summarized if the onset date is on or after the first dose of study drug and within 30 days after the last dose, or it occurred before the first dose of study drug and worsened while on the therapy., Baseline through Study Completion (Up to 12 Weeks)|Pharmacokinetics: Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of Ramucirumab, Cycle 1 & 2: Predose, End of Infusion, 0.5 hour (h) ,1h, 2h, 4h, 8h, 24h, 48h,72h or 96h, 168h, 264h, and 336h Postdose (and 504h Postdose Cohort 2 only)|Pharmacokinetics: Minimum Concentration (Cmin) of Ramucirumab, Cycle 2-5: Predose|Pharmacokinetics: Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve (AUC) of Ramucirumab, Cycle 1 analysis performed: Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve Zero to Infinity (AUC\[0-∞\]); Cycle 2 analysis performed: Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve Over the Dosing Interval at Steady State (AUC\[τ,ss\]), Cycle 1 & 2: Predose, End of Infusion, 0.5 hour (h) ,1h, 2h, 4h, 8h, 24h, 48h,72h or 96h, 168h, 264h, and 336h Postdose (and 504h Postdose Cohort 2 only)
Duration of Response, Participants achieved an objective response if they had a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). According to RECIST v1.1, CR was the disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions, with the short axes of any target lymph node reduced to \<10 mm, the disappearance of all nontarget lesions, and the normalization of tumor marker levels (if tumor markers were initially above the upper limit of normal); PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (including the short axes of any target lymph node), taking as reference the baseline sum diameter. For each participant who is not known to have died or to have had objective progression of disease as of the data-inclusion cut-off date for a particular analysis, duration of tumor response was to be censored at the date of the participant's last objective tumor assessment prior to that cut-off date., Time Between Meeting Response Criteria and Progressive Disease or Death Due to Any Cause (Up to 10 Weeks)|Duration of Stable Disease (SD), Duration of SD is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD), taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters while on study. SD is measured at the start of the study drug until progressive disease or death due to any cause, whichever is first. Censoring occurred if a participant did not have a complete baseline disease assessment, initiated on another anti-cancer therapy (censored at the date of the last complete objective progression-free disease assessment before initiation of the new therapy), was not known to have died or had objective progression as of the data inclusion cutoff date for analysis., Baseline to Progressive Disease or Death Due to Any Cause (Up to 10 Weeks)|Time to Disease Progression, Time to progressive disease was measured from the start of study drug until progressive disease. Censoring occurred if a participant did not have a complete baseline disease assessment, initiated on another anti-cancer therapy (censored at the date of the last complete objective progression-free disease assessment before initiation of the new therapy), was not known to have died or had objective progression as of the data inclusion cutoff date for analysis., Baseline to Progressive Disease (Up to 10 Weeks)|Number of Participants With Anti-Ramucirumab Antibodies, A sample will be considered positive for circulating anti-ramucirumab antibodies if it exhibits a post-baseline antibody level that exceeds the upper 95% confidence interval of the mean determined from the normal anti-ramucirumab level seen in healthy untreated individuals. A participant will be considered to have an anti-ramucirumab response if there are 2 consecutive positive samples or if the final sample tested is positive., Cycle 1: Pre-infusion, Cycle 2: Pre-infusion, Cycle 3: Pre-infusion|Number of Participants With Best Objective Response (BOR), Participants achieved disease control if they had a BOR of CR, PR or SD. Progressive Disease (PD) and those participants which were Not Evaluable (NE) were also reported. According to RECIST v1.1, CR was the disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions, with the short axes of any target lymph node reduced to \<10 mm, the disappearance of all nontarget lesions, and the normalization of tumor marker levels (if tumor markers were initially above the upper limit of normal); PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (including the short axes of any target lymph node), taking as reference the baseline sum diameter. SD was neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify as PR nor sufficient increase to qualify as PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameter since treatment started., Baseline to Progressive Disease or Participant Stopped Study (Up to 10 Weeks)
