Clinical Trial of Qizhu Yuling Prescription in the Prevention and Treatment of Esophagus Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Qizhu Yuling prescription for postoperative esophagus cancer.
Esophagus Cancer
DRUG: Qizhu Yuling Prescription|DRUG: Placebo
1-year disease-free survival rate, Refers to the proportion of patients who did not experience recurrence, metastasis or death (from any cause) within 1 years after surgery., The day of surgery until the first year
Disease-free survival, It is the time from randomization to tumor progression or death (from any cause)., Randomization until disease recurrence, metastasis, death (from any cause) , or 36 months after surgery, whichever occurs first.|Overall survival, It is the time from randomization to death (from any cause)., Randomization until death (from any cause) or 36 months after surgery, whichever occurs first.|Cumulative annual recurrence and metastasis rate for 1-3 years, Refers to the proportion of patients with recurrence and metastasis within 1-3 years from the day of surgery., The day of surgery until the once, second and third year.|Cumulative annual survival rate for 1-3 years, Refers to the proportion of patients with survical within 1-3 years from the day of surgery., The day of surgery until the once, second and third year.|Indexes related to fat distribution, Total Fat Area, Visceral Fat Area and Subcutaneous Fat Area. They measure fat area on cross-sectional images using plain CT scanning., before and after every third cycles of treatment (each cycle is 28 days), assessed up to recurrence and metastasis (up to 3 years after surgery).|Visceral Adiposity Index, It is a new assessment of visceral fat based on waist circumference (WC), BMI, triglyceride (TG) and HDL.

Male VAI = during \[WC/(39.68 + 1.88 x BMI)\] \* (TG / 1.03) \* (1.31 / HDL). Female VAI = during \[WC/(36.58 + 1.89 x BMI)\] \* (TG / 0.81) \* (1.52 / HDL)., before and after every third cycles of treatment (each cycle is 28 days), assessed up to recurrence and metastasis (up to 3 years after surgery).|Tumor marker, CEA, before and after every third cycles of treatment (each cycle is 28 days), assessed up to recurrence and metastasis (up to 3 years after surgery).|Tumor marker, SCC, before and after every third cycles of treatment (each cycle is 28 days), assessed up to recurrence and metastasis (up to 3 years after surgery).|Tumor marker, CYFR21-1, before and after every third cycles of treatment (each cycle is 28 days), assessed up to recurrence and metastasis (up to 3 years after surgery).|Tumor marker, CA199, before and after every third cycles of treatment (each cycle is 28 days), assessed up to recurrence and metastasis (up to 3 years after surgery).|Peripheral blood inflammatory index LMR, The ratio of lymphocytes to monocytes (LMR), before and after every third cycles of treatment (each cycle is 28 days), assessed up to recurrence and metastasis (up to 3 years after surgery).|Peripheral blood inflammatory index LNR, The ratio of Lymphocyte to neutrophil ratio (LNR), before and after every third cycles of treatment (each cycle is 28 days), assessed up to recurrence and metastasis (up to 3 years after surgery).|Prognostic nutritional index, Serum albumin level (g/L) +5× total number of peripheral blood lymphocytes (×10 \^ 9 /L), before and after every third cycles of treatment (each cycle is 28 days), assessed up to recurrence and metastasis (up to 3 years after surgery).|Quality of life of the patient (QLQ-QES18), The score will be measured by Quality of Life Questionnaire of Oesophageal-Specific Module 18. Each question is scored from 1 to 4 with 18 questions giving a total score of 18 to 72. A higher score indicates a poorer quality of life., Before and after every cycle of treatment (each cycle is 28 days), assessed up to death or 3 years after surgery.|Evaluation of the patient's symptoms (MDASI-TCM), The score will be measured with M. D. Anderson Symptom Traditional Chinese Medicine. Each question is scored from 0 to 10 with 26 questions for a total score of 0 to 260. A higher score indicates a poorer symptom., Before and after every cycle of treatment (each cycle is 28 days), assessed up to death or 3 years after surgery.|Medication compliance, The number of cases and percentage were calculated as \< 80%, 80-120% and \> 120%, From randomization to the end of the sixth course of medication （up to 24 weeks）.|Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events, Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events in different arms., aseline until disease progression, death, or assessed up to 36 months after surgery.
This study include a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo, parallel controlled clinical trial.The randomized clinical trial will enroll approximately 310 patients. Participants will be randomly divided into experimental (n=155) and placebo groups (n=155).Patients in the experimental group was treated with Qizhu Yuling prescription within 6 months after esophagus cancer R0. Patients in the control group will receive the placebo.The primary endpoint is 1-year DFS (Disease-free survival) rate after surgery, that refers to the proportion of patients who do not have recurrence, metastasis or death (from any cause) within 1 years after surgery. The research protocol was approved by the relevant ethics committees, and the study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Patients gave written informed consent to participate in the trial.
