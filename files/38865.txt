Safety and Efficacy Study of TRU-016 Plus Bendamustine vs. Bendamustine in Relapsed Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
The objective of the first part of the study is to determine a safe dose of TRU-016 that can be used in combination with bendamustine in patients with relapsed CLL. The objectives of the second part of the study are to compare the safety and efficacy of TRU-016 in combination with bendamustine to bendamustine alone in patients with relapsed CLL.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)
DRUG: TRU-016 and bendamustine|DRUG: Bendamustine|DRUG: 15 mg/kg TRU-016 and bendamustine|DRUG: 20 mg/kg TRU-016 and bendamustine
Response Per International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) Criteria, Patients had full clinical response assessment monthly during treatment, at the end of treatment (EOT) visit, 30 and 60 days after the EOT visit, and subsequently every 3 months until the earliest of progression of CLL, death, initiation of new therapy, withdrawal from the study, or completion of 18 months of follow-up evaluations. Clinical response assessment included physical examination with measurement of spleen, liver, and lymph nodes, disease-related symptoms, and laboratory measurements, specifically complete blood count (CBC) with differential., 1 and 2 months after end of treatment, then every 3 months until disease progression, death, initiation of new therapy, study withdrawal, or 2 years
Response Per NCI Criteria, Overall response rate per National Cancer Institute (NCI) Working group criteria., 1 and 2 months after end of treatment, then every 3 months until disease progression, death, initiation of new therapy, study withdrawal, or 2 years
This study consisted of two parts. The initial dose escalation stage was a Phase 1b study evaluating the safety and tolerability of two doses of TRU-016 administered in combination with bendamustine to patients with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In the randomized Phase 2 stage of the study, the efficacy and safety of the selected dose of 20 mg/kg TRU-016 combined with bendamustine was compared to bendamustine alone. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of TRU-016 and the development of antibodies to TRU-016 were evaluated in both phases of the study.
