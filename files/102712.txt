Nilotinib + Pegylated Interferon Alpha 2a for Untreated Chronic Phase Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia
The aim of this study is to demonstrate the safety and the efficacy of a combination of 2 treatments shown to have some efficacy in Chronic Phase Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CP CML) separately, but that have never been combined to date, and this combination is expected to substantially increase the molecular response rates.
Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia
DRUG: Nilotinib,Novartis,300 mg twice a day +Pegylated interferon 2a,Roche, 45 microg weekly starting Month 2-Month 12 or beyond according to investigator choice.
Cumulative incidence of complete molecular remissions after 12 months of treatment with nilotinib + Pegylated Interferon (PEG-IFN), The trial opens for enrolment in 2011 March 7th for 18 months. Each patient will be followed for 24 months after entry., 24 months
Kinetics of Complete Molecular Response (CMR) at 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 24 months., CMR corresponds to a level of BCR-ABL transcripts \< 0.001 % (BCR-ABL/ABL ratio \< 0.001%). The BCR-ABL/ABL ratio will be analysed by Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) at 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 24 months to study kinetics of CMR., Patients will be enrolled for 18 months and will be followed for 24 months|Stability of CMR : Proportion of patients maintaining their CMR at 18 and 24 months, Patients will be enrolled for 18 months and will be followed for 24 months|Kinetics of Major Molecular Response (MMR) at 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 24 months., MMR corresponds to a level of BCR-ABL transcripts \< 0.1 % (BCR-ABL/ABL ratio \< 0.1%). The BCR-ABL/ABL ratio is analysed by RT-PCR at 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 24 months to study kinetics of MMR., Patients will be enrolled for 18 months and will be followed for 24 months|Stability of MMR : proportion of patients maintaining their MMR at 18 and 24 months, Patients will be enrolled for 18 months and will be followed for 24 months|Cumulative Complete Cytogenetic Remission (CCyR) rates at 3, 6 and 12 months., Patients will be enrolled for 18 months and will be followed for 24 months|Safety (hematologic and non-hematologic) of the combination nilotinib + PEG-IFN, Patients will be enrolled for 18 months and will be followed for 24 months|Dose reductions or interruptions of each treatment studied, Patients will be enrolled for 18 months and will be followed for 24 months|Progression free survival., Patients will be enrolled for 18 months and will be followed for 24 months|Overall survival., Patients will be enrolled for 18 months and will be followed for 24 months|Quality of life on nilotinib + PEG-IFN, Patients will be enrolled for 18 months and will be followed for 24 months|Event free survival., Patients will be enrolled for 18 months and will be followed for 24 months
