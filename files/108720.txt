The purpose of the study is to determine the optimal safe and tolerable dose of gemcitabine in combination with once daily or twice daily dose of PTK/ZK in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer. The Phase II part of this study planned to determine the antitumor activity of this regimen and its effectiveness of preventing tumor growth and spread.
