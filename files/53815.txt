A Study of JNJ-89402638 for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the putative recommended phase 2 dose(s) (RP2Ds) of JNJ-89402638 and to determine the safety of JNJ-89402638 at the RP2D(s) in participants with metastatic colorectal cancer.
Unresectable Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: JNJ-89402638
Part 1 and Part 2: Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) by Severity, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant participating in a clinical study that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the pharmaceutical/biological agent under study. Severity of AEs will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 5.0. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) will be graded per American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) consensus., From Baseline up to approximately 24 months|Part 1: Number of Participants with Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT), The DLTs are specific adverse events including high grade hematologic or non-hematologic toxicities., From Baseline up to 28 days
Part 1 and Part 2: Serum Concentration for JNJ-89402638, Serum Concentration for JNJ-89402638 will be reported., Up to approximately 24 months|Part 1 and Part 2: Maximum Serum Concentration (Cmax) of JNJ-89402638, Cmax of JNJ-89402638 will be reported., Up to approximately 24 months|Part 1 and Part 2: Minimum Serum Concentration (Cmin) of JNJ-89402638, Cmin of JNJ-89402638 will be reported., Up to approximately 24 months|Part 1 and Part 2: Time to Reach Maximum Observed Serum Concentration (Tmax) of JNJ-89402638, Tmax of JNJ-89402638 will be reported., Up to approximately 24 months|Part 1 and Part 2: Area Under the Serum Concentration-time Curve (AUC) of JNJ-89402638, AUC of JNJ-89402638 will be reported., Up to approximately 24 months|Part 1 and Part 2: Number of Participants with Presence of Anti-JNJ-89402638 Antibodies, Participants with anti-JNJ-89402638 antibodies will be reported., Up to approximately 24 months|Part 1 and Part 2: Overall Response (OR), Overall response is best response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), assessed according to response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) version 1.1., Up to approximately 24 months|Part 1 and Part 2: Complete Response (CR), Complete response is defined as a best response of CR assessed according to RECIST version 1.1., Up to approximately 24 months|Part 1 and Part 2: Time to Response (TTR), TTR is defined for participants who achieved an OR from the time of the first dose of study treatment to the first response of PR or better as assessed according to RECIST version 1.1., Up to approximately 24 months|Part 1 and Part 2: Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined for participants who achieved an OR in the time between the date of initial documentation of first response of PR or better to the date of first documented evidence of progressive disease or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, as assessed according to RECIST version 1.1, Up to approximately 24 months
The purpose of this study is to determine the putative recommended phase 2 dose(s) (RP2Ds) of JNJ-89402638 and to determine the safety of JNJ-89402638 at the RP2D(s) in participants with metastatic colorectal cancer.
