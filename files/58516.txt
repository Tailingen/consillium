ZN-c3 in Adult Participants With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and potential clinical benefits of ZN-c3 administered in combination with encorafenib and cetuximab in adult participants with metastatic BRAF V600E mutant colorectal cancer previously treated with one or two treatment regimens.
