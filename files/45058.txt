Alternate Dosing Schedules Study for HPV Vaccine
To determine if delayed dosing of recombinant human papillomavirus (HPV) quadrivalent (Types 6, 11, 16, and 18) vaccine in 9-18 year old girls elicits an equivalent immune response (geometric mean titers to HPV 6,11,16, and 18 as measured one month after receipt of a 3rd dose of HPV vaccine) when compared to vaccine delivered according to the recommended dosing schedule. This is a prospective observational study of healthy 9-18 year old female patients receiving either a second or third dose of HPV vaccine as part of their well child care. Immune responses to HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18 will be measured both before and 1 month after the third dose of HPV vaccine with the purpose of comparing the immune responses to HPV vaccine when administered at naturally occurring longer dosing intervals to the immune response to HPV vaccine when administered as routinely recommended.

Girls receiving a 3rd dose of HPV vaccine in addition to concomitantly administered vaccines by injection were randomized to receive either the HPV vaccine first or their concomitantly administered vaccines first. Pain following vaccination was assessed in each arm using the Faces Pain Scale - Revised.

Please note: This record refers only to the randomized portion of the study where pain following vaccination was assessed. Please refer to NCT02280642 for the observational portion of the study.

Pain Following HPV Vaccine, Participants with Faces Pain Scale - Revised (FPS-R) score higher in arm where HPV received compared to arm where concomitant vaccines received.

The Faces Pain Scale Revised is a dimensionless 10 point likert scale used to assess self-reported pain intensity on a scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (most pain you can imagine). Greater pain scores are indicative of more severe pain., 10 minutes following vaccination
