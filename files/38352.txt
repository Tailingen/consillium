Metagenomic Evaluation of the Gut Microbiome in Patients With Lynch Syndrome and Other Hereditary Colonic Polyposis Syndromes
The purpose of this study is to understand the role bacteria that normally live in the colon may play in colorectal cancer risk, in addition to the hereditary risk to colorectal cancer. The investigators will collect stool specimens as well as additional colon biopsy specimens during the patient's scheduled colonoscopy procedure. The investigators will also collect a questionnaire about diet and lifestyle. The samples will be used to study the impact of diet on naturally-occurring oral and gut bacteria and their influences on human health including risk of cancer.
