An Exploratory Study of Atezolizumab and Bevacizumab in Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer With Liver Metastases (INTEGRATE)
This study is being done to look at how effective the drug, atezolizumab, with or without the drug bevacizumab, is for people with inoperable liver cancer or non-small lung cancer that has spread to the liver. This will be done by looking at the duration of time from starting the study drug(s) until the cancer worsens in study participants.

This study will collect blood and tumor tissue samples from participants to look at changes to their tumor(s) before and after receiving atezolizumab and/or bevacizumab.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma|Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Metastatic|Liver Metastases
DRUG: Atezolizumab|DRUG: Bevacizumab
Progression-free survival, Time from enrollment until the date of objective disease progression, 4 years
Overall response rate, 4 years|Average duration of response, 4 years|Overall survival rate, 2 years|Progression-free survival rate, 1 year
Participants with liver cancer will be assigned to Arm A and receive atezolizumab and bevacizumab.

Participants with non-small cell lung cancer will be randomized into one of the following arms:

* Arm B: Atezolizumab and bevacizumab
* Arm C: Atezolizumab alone

Participants randomized to Arm C whose disease worsens may be able to cross over to Arm B and receive atezolizumab and bevacizumab together.
