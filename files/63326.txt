Phase 1/2, Open Label, Dose Escalation Study of NEOD001 in Subjects With Light Chain (AL) Amyloidosis
Dose escalation study to determine the maximum tolerated dose of NEOD001 in approximately 30 subjects with AL amyloidosis. Expansion phase to evaluate safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of NEOD001 in 25 additional subjects at the maximum tolerated dose.

The purpose of the dose escalation phase of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose/Phase 2 recommended dose of NEOD001 when given as a single agent intravenously in approximately 30 subjects with AL amyloidosis.

The purpose of the expansion phase of the study is to evaluate the safety, preliminary efficacy and pharmacokinetics of single agent NEOD001 at the maximum tolerated dose/Phase 2 recommended dose in approximately 25 additional evaluable subjects.
