Randomized Phase II Study of DCE-MRI-based Dose Escalation for Poor-prognosis and Neck Cancer
This study aims to improve locoregional control of poor prognosis Head and Neck Cancer (HNC) patients by selectively escalating the radiotherapy dose to subvolumes of tumor likely to be resistant to standard Radiation Therapy (RT) using DCE-MRI (Dynamic Contrast Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging). Standard doses of radiotherapy to the rest of the tissues and surrounding normal tissues will be maintained.
Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck
DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Carboplatin|RADIATION: IMRT (Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy)|RADIATION: Boost Radiation to Hypoperfused Volumes
Disease Free Survival (DSF) time, Kaplan-Meier curves with point-wise 90% confidence intervals will be generated for each treatment arm, overall and by strata. Estimates with confidence intervals will be generated from these curves for the usual summary statistics, including median DFS times and DFS at 1, 2, and 3 years., 3 years post treatment
Local-regional control rate, Compare local-regional control rates between the two arms at 1, 2 and 3 years. Local-regional control is defined as the absence of local-regional progression., 3 years post-treatment|Proportion of patients in which hypoperfused/low-diffusion subvolumes overlap with recurrence volumes, 3 years post treatment|Number of patients with adverse events, Acute and late toxicities will be summarized descriptively by grade and type for each treatment group. The proportion of patients experiencing certain toxicity types will be calculated with score based confidence intervals. Chi-square tests will be used to test whether the proportion of patients with toxicity differs between treatment groups., 3 years post treatment|Correlation coefficient between continuous dose and perfusion summary measures, Pearson or Spearman rank based correlation between the continuous dose and perfusion summary measures, 2 weeks post Radiation Therapy (RT)
