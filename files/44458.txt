Circulating " Cancer Cells / Macrophage " HYbrid Cells in Patients With Sarcoma?
Pilot, prospective, monocentric study aimed at evaluating the rate of patients with circulating "cancer cell/macrophage" hybrid cells in the peripheral blood.

The study will be conducted on a population of patients with sarcoma and treated in the context of routine care.

For each included patient, blood samples will be collected during baseline visit and after the initiation therapy.

At the end of the 2nd blood collection, the patient will have completed his participation in the study.
Sarcoma
OTHER: Blood samples will be collected at two times :
Rate of patients with "cancer cell / macrophage" hybrid cells in peripheral blood., 6 months after the end of inclusions
Quantification of circulating hybrid cells in peripheral blood by automatic measurement (Cell Counter Corning) and expressed in number of cells / millilitre of blood., 6 months after the end of inclusions
