Hyperthermia Enhanced Re-irradiation of Loco-regional Recurrent Tumors
This study investiagates deep-regional or superficial hyperthermia to enhance radiotherapy or chemoradiation in patients that suffer recurrent disease after previous radiotherapy.

DEVICE: loco-regional hyperthermia
Local tumor recurrence, Local tumor recurrence of re-irradiated lesions, calculated with the Kaplan-Meier estimates. Local recurrence after hyperthermic re-irradiation will be compared to time-to recurrence after initial treatment., 3 years
Overall survival, Overall survival after start of re-irradiation, 3 years|Progression-free survival, Progression-free survival after start of re-irradiation, 3 years|Freedom from distant metastases, Freedom from distant metastases after start of re-irradiation, 3 years|Patient reported quality of Life, patient reported quality of life measured by the EORTC qlq-c30 questionnaire., 3 years
patients that present a relapse within the previously irradiated volume can be included in this trial. These patients will receive re-irradiation according to clinical guidelines and hyperthermia as study intervention. According to tumor location hyperthermia can either be performed by microwave or by capacitive devices.

The primary endpoint of this study is non-inferiority of re-irradiation compared to the initial course of radiotherapy (calculated as time to local failure).
