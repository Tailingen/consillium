Feasibility of VMAT and CBCT for Head and Neck Carcinomas
This will be a prospective longitudinal study describing clinical throughput metrics and patient reported quality of life outcome measures for patients undergoing Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) with and without Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) for head and neck carcinoma at the British Columbia Cancer Agency.

1. VMAT for the treatment of patients with HNC will provide opportunities for image-guided radiotherapy using CBCT online correction to reduce systematic and random error.
2. Analysis of patient reported quality of life outcomes during VMAT, with and without CBCT acquisition, will be hypothesis generating.

Clinical efficiency for volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) delivery, Prospective work-flow metrics describing clinical efficiency for volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) delivery with and without cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) acquisition at the BCCA, generated from time requirements for treatment verification and delivery. The time spent by the patients at each stage of radiation therapy delivery will be recorded, including; time in radiation bunker, time in immobilization frame, kV or CBCT acquisition and online correction time, and beam on time, After patient treated|Position verification, Summary description of position verification and online corrections for volumetric modulated arch therapy (VMAT) delivery with and without cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), After patient treated
