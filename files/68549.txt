Vasopressin Versus Norepinephrine for the Management of Septic Shock in Cancer Patients
Although arginine vasopressin has been used as an additional drug in refractory shock in worldwide clinical practice, there are no prospective studies using it as a first choice therapy in patients with cancer and septic shock.

The aim of this study is assess if the use of arginine vasopressin would be more effective on treatment of septic shock in cancer patients than norepinephrine, decreasing the composite end point of mortality and organ failure in 28 days.
