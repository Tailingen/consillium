Study of MK-2206 in Patients With Metastatic Neuroendocrine Tumors (NET)
The purpose of this study is to test a new drug called MK-2206. This study is a phase II study. In cancer studies, a phase II study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad, a new treatment has against a certain type of cancer.

MK-2206 is an oral medication known as a targeted therapy. By attaching to the target, we hope that MK-2206 may stop the cancer cells from further growth and dividing. This study will help find out if MK-2206 is a helpful drug when taken in patients with neuroendocrine tumor.

DRUG: MK-2206
Overall Response., Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started., every 12 weeks
