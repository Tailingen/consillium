Exploratory Trial to Estimate Proportion of Patients With Tumor Cell Contaminated Leukapheresis Products With and Without Bortezomib With In-vivo Purging - Multiple Myeloma (MM)
Explore stem cell collection with or without bortezomib with in-vivo purging in multiple myeloma.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Bortezomib|DRUG: Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)|DRUG: Mozobil
Multiparametric Flow Cytometry - Minimum Residual Disease, Estimate the proportion of subjects with plasma cell contamination (defined as \>0.01% and at least 100 cellular events) of harvested stem cell product by multi parametric flow cytometry (MFC) from patients with myeloma undergoing autologous stem cell collection 1) by standard of care mobilization using Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) with or without Mozobil and 2) after two doses of bortezomib as in vivo purging plus standard of care using G-CSF with or without Mozobil., Day 0 for all subjects (Day 0 is the day of stem cell collection)
Multiparametric Flow Cytometry - Cluster of Differentiation 34 (CD34)Assessment, Estimate the proportion of subjects who have a successful collection of stem cells (\> 2 million Cluster of Differentiation 34 (CD34) cells/Kg of body weight) for autologous transplant in both treatment groups., Within the first 30 days after stem cell collection|Cluster of Differentiation 34 (CD34) Enumeration, Estimate the percentage of Cluster of Differentiation 34 (CD34) positive cells in circulating peripheral blood as a measure of mobilization on the days of collection., Within the first 30 days after stem cell collection
High dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplant has resulted in improved overall survival and is currently considered an effective first line therapy applicable to the majority of patients with multiple myeloma. However disease relapse is inevitable and remains the primary cause of mortality in this cohort.

The purpose of this study is to estimate the proportion of subjects with plasma cell contamination of harvested stem cell product in standard and treatment arms. The study will explore whether or not in-vivo purging of malignant tumor plasma cells will improve progression free survival (PFS) for patients.

The study will consist of two groups:

Group A: Standard of Care (SOC) stem cell collection without in-vivo purging with bortezomib. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and Mozobil used if needed.

Group B: Bortezomib 1.3mg/m\^2 will be given subcutaneously (SQ) on days -11 and -8 followed by Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) on days -4 through -1 prior to stem cell harvest (day 0).
