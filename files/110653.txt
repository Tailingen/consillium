Preoperative Chemoradiotherapy for Locally Advanced Resectable Gastric Adenocarcinoma
Gastric cancer is a high incidence in Asia, and one of the leading cause of death in Korea. A cure rate is improving due to early diagnosis. However, the 5-year survival rate of gastric cancer excluding early gastric cancer is about 40 \~ 67%. Therefore, several methods for lowering the recurrence rate have been attempted and concurrent chemoradiotherapy can be considered as a method to lower the recurrence rate of gastric cancer. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pathologic response rate and safety of patients who underwent surgery after chemoradiotherapy.
