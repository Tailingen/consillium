Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), To indentify the incidence of TEAEs, From the initiation of the first dose to 28 days after the last dose
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of patients who have a best overall response of partial response (PR),very good partial response(VGPR), complete response (CR) or stringent complete response (sCR) as per International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG), Throughout the study treatment(Up to 32 weeks)|Clinical Benefit Rate(CBR), CBR is defined as the proportion of patients who have a best overall response of minimal response(MR),PR,VGPR,CR or sCR as per IMWG, Throughout the study treatment(Up to 32 weeks)|Disease control rate(DCR), DCR is defined as the proportion of patients who have a best overall response of stable disease (SD),MR,PR,VGPR,CR or sCR as per IMWG, Throughout the study treatment(Up to 32 weeks)|Duration of response (DoR), DoR is defined as the time from the first assessment of PR,VGPR,CR orsCR until the date of first occurrence of progressive disease (PD) as per IMWG, Throughout the study completion.(An average of 12 months)|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of first dose until the date of first documented PD as per IMWG or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, Throughout the study completion.(An average of 12 months)|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of first dose until the date of death from any cause, Throughout the study completion.(An average of 36 months)
This is a multicenter, open-label, phase I study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of mitoxantrone hydrochloride liposome injection in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. In the study, 60 patients will be recruited into three dose groups. All patients will receive the treatment for the planned 8 cycles(28 days per cycleï¼‰until disease progression or unacceptable drug-related adverse events
