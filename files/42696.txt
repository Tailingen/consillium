SBRT Compared With IMRT Concurrently With Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With LS-SCLC
As stereotactic radiotherapy (SBRT) has been widely used in clinical practice at present, the aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of stereotactic body radiation therapy compared with intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) concurrently with EP regimen(cisplatin plus etoposide) in treating patients with limited-stage small cell lung cancer
Small Cell Lung Cancer
RADIATION: SBRT|RADIATION: IMRT|DRUG: EP
progression-free survival, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first，assessed up to 3 years
Overall survival, From date of randomization until last survival confirm date or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 3 years|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability], Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, the first date of treatment to 3 months after the last dose of study drug|Tumor response rate, the ratio between the number of responders and number of patients assessable for tumor response，assessed up to 1 years
