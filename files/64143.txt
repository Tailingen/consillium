Safety and Immune Response to a Multi-component Immune Based Therapy (MKC1106-MT) for Patients With Melanoma.
A dose comparison of a multi-component active immunotherapy designed to stimulate an immune reaction to specific tumor associated antigens which are highly expressed on melanomas.
Advanced Melanoma|Stage III and IV Melanoma
BIOLOGICAL: Biological: MKC1106-MT|BIOLOGICAL: Biological: MKCC1106-MT
Is to assess the safety and tolerability of MKC1106-MT regimen, 6 weeks
To assess the immune response (by tetramer and ELISPOT analysis) of MKC1106-MT when administered to subjects with advanced melanoma, 6 Weeks|To determine pMEL-TYR plasmid level in the blood by PCR analysis, 6 Weeks|To determine target antigen expression (Melan A and tyrosinase) and beta2 microglobulin expression in the tumor tissue, 6 Weeks|To document any preliminary evidence of clinical response, 6 Weeks
The multi-component active immunotherapy, MKC1106-MT, consists of 1 plasmid dose and 2 peptides doses designed to stimulate an immune reaction to two tumor associated antigens (Melan-A and tyrosinase). The plasmid component will be administered on Days 1,4, 15 and 18 of each treatment cycle followed by administration of peptides on Days 29 and 32 of the treatment cycle. All components will be administered separately into superficial inguinal lymph nodes under ultrasound guidance.
