Randomised Study of Mucositis Prevention After Radiochemotherapy Treatment for Head and Neck Cancer
This randomised, double-blind study will compare an oral immunomodulatory solution to a placebo for the prevention of acute severe mucositis in head and neck cancer patients treated surgically and concomitantly with radiochemotherapy. The investigators expect a decrease of 25% of severe acute mucositis in experimental arm.
