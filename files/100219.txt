A Phase 2, Open-Label, Multicenter Study of the GARFT Inhibitor in Patients With Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
The primary objective of this study is to determine safety and activity of a novel anticancer agent in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who failed 2 or 3 prior systemic treatments.
Lung Neoplasms
DRUG: AG2037
To determine the overall objective response rate (complete and partial responses) of AG-2037 in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who failed 2 or 3 prior systematic treatments.
Evaluate the safety of AG-2037.|Estimate the time to progression (TTP).|Evaluate 1-year overall survival of patients treated with AG-2037.|Evaluate population PK and correlate the various genetic markers of MTAP, folate, and purine metabolism with clinical response.
