A Study to Evaluate Chemotherapy Plus Osimertinib Against Chemotherapy Plus Placebo in Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
The study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment with chemotherapy in combination with osimertinib compared to chemotherapy in combination with placebo in patients whose disease has progressed extracranially following first-line osimertinib treatment.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Osimertinib (AZD9291) pemetrexed cisplatin or carboplatin|DRUG: Placebo for osimertinib (AZD9291) pemetrexed cisplatin or carboplatin
Progression free survival(PFS):time from randomization until progression(intra- or extracranial whichever occurs first)per RECIST 1.1(for extracranial)and CNS RECIST 1.1(for intracranial progression)as assessed by Investigator or death due to any cause, To compare the efficacy of chemotherapy plus osimertinib treatment relative to chemotherapy plus placebo based on PFS, At Screening,every 6 weeks for the first 13 cycles (each cycle is 21 days),then every 12 weeks, relative to randomization,and upto intracranial or extracranial disease progression or end of survival follow-up,whichever comes first (approximately 3 years)
Intracranial PFS is defined as time from randomization until intracranial progression per CNS RECIST 1.1 as assessed by the Investigator at local site or death due to any cause, To compare the efficacy of chemotherapy plus osimertinib treatment relative to chemotherapy plus placebo based on intracranial PFS in patients with baseline brain metastases and patients without baseline brain metastases, At Screening,every 6 weeks for the first 13 cycles (each cycle is 21 days), then every 12 weeks, relative to randomization, and upto intracranial disease progression or end of survival follow-up, whichever comes first (approximately 3 years)|Extracranial PFS is defined as time from randomization until extracranial progression per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by the Investigator at local site or death due to any cause, To compare the efficacy of chemotherapy plus osimertinib treatment relative to chemotherapy plus placebo based on extracranial PFS, At Screening,every 6 weeks for the first 13 cycles (each cycle is 21 days), then every 12 weeks, relative to randomization, and upto extracranial disease progression or end of survival follow-up, whichever comes first (approximately 3 years)|OS: the length of time from randomization until the date of death due to any cause, To compare the efficacy of chemotherapy plus osimertinib treatment relative to chemotherapy plus placebo based on OS, From randomization through post progression survival follow-up (up to approximately 3 years)|Number of patients with serious and non-serious adverse events, To assess the safety and tolerability of chemotherapy plus osimertinib treatment relative to chemotherapy plus placebo in patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFRm NSCLC whose disease has progressed extracranially on first-line osimertinib treatment., From screening through post progression survival follow-up (at least once every 12 weeks relative to randomization)
This is a Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of platinum plus pemetrexed chemotherapy plus osimertinib versus platinum plus pemetrexed chemotherapy plus placebo in patients with epidermal growth factor receptor mutation-positive (EGFRm), locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with or wihout stable brain metastases who responded to first-line osimertinib therapy (complete response \[CR\] or partial response \[PR\]) or stable disease (SD) for â‰¥ 6 months during first-line osimertinib treatment, and subsequently experienced radiological, extracranial disease progression. Approximately 204 patients were to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to treatment with platinum plus pemetrexed chemotherapy plus osimertinib (Treatment Arm A) or platinum plus pemetrexed chemotherapy plus placebo (Treatment Arm B). However, the number of patients has been reduced to approximately 80 patients due to treatment landscape changes which outpaced study recruitment. Patients will be stratified based on the presence of brain metastases (stable brain metastases based on central nervous system (CNS) Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 \[RECIST 1.1\] assessments versus no brain metastases).

The 2 randomized treatment regimens are as follows:

* Treatment Arm A: Osimertinib 80 mg once daily (QD) with pemetrexed (500 mg/m\^2) (with pre-treatment) plus either cisplatin (75 mg/m\^2) or carboplatin (area under the concentration-time curve \[AUC\] 5), both administered on Day 1 of 21-day cycles for 4 cycles, followed by osimertinib 80 mg QD plus pemetrexed maintenance (500 mg/m\^2) on Day 1 of 21-day cycles
* Treatment Arm B: Placebo QD with pemetrexed (500 mg/m\^2) (with pre-treatment) plus either cisplatin (75 mg/m\^2) or carboplatin (AUC5), both administered on Day 1 of 21-day cycles for 4 cycles, followed by placebo QD plus pemetrexed maintenance (500 mg/m\^2) on Day 1 of 21-day cycles.
