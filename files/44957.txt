A Study of FORE8394 as a Single Agent in Patients With Advanced Unresectable Solid Tumors
The objective of this study is to determine the safety, pharmacokinetics, maximum tolerated dose/recommended Phase 2 dose, and efficacy of FORE8394.
Advanced Unresectable Solid Tumors|BRAF-mutated Tumors
DRUG: FORE8394
Area under the curve (AUC) of FORE8394, First dose of FORE8394 up to 30 days after end of treatment|Maximum concentration (Cmax) of FORE8394, First dose of FORE8394 up to 30 days after end of treatment|Time to peak concentration (Tmax) of FORE8394, First dose of FORE8394 up to 30 days after end of treatment|Half life (T1/2) of FORE8394, First dose of FORE8394 up to 30 days after end of treatment|Number of participants with Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) as assessed by CTCAE v4.0., First dose of FORE8394 up to 30 days after end of treatment|To identify the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of FORE8394 in Group A (adult patients) for further evaluation in Dose Extension., 2 years|Compare AUC of FORE8394 with FORE8394, First dose of FORE8394 up to 30 days after end of treatment|Compare Cmax of FORE8394 with FORE8394, First dose of FORE8394 up to 30 days after end of treatment|Compare Tmax of FORE8394 with FORE8394, First dose of FORE8394 up to 30 days after end of treatment|Compare T1/2 of FORE8394 with FORE8394, First dose of FORE8394 up to 30 days after end of treatment|To determine the overall response rate of FORE8394 treatment at the applicable RP2D in a) Group A, Cohort 1, and b) Group A, Cohort 2., 5 years
To evaluate the duration of response (defined as time of initial response to progressive disease or death) at the applicable RP2D in Dose Extension., 5 years|To evaluate the progression free survival (defined as time of first dose to progressive disease or death) at the applicable RP2D in Dose Extension., 5 years|Clinical benefit rate (defined as stable disease, partial response and complete response) after 24 weeks on study, 5 years
Dose Escalation (Part 1): To evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics of FORE8394 in adult and pediatric patients with advanced BRAF- mutated tumors, and to identify the recommended Phase 2 Dose.

Dose Extension (Part 2): To access objective tumor response to FORE8394 treatment in adult and in adolescent patients with advanced BRAF- mutated tumors, to access RECIST, and to access pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety.
