Efficacy of Ultrasound Contrast Agent to Assess Renal Masses
Patients with an incidentally discovered small renal masses (SRM) \< 4 cm in diameter are included. All patients will undergo biopsy for tissue diagnosis. Most patients will be followed by imaging. Study intervention includes low MI US to be performed following both bolus and infusion injection of Definity contrast. Presence and absence of vascularity, pattern of vascularity, and TIC values will be correlated with the final pathology to find features differentiating benign from malignant masses.
