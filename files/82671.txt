Masitinib in Combination With Gemcitabine for Treatment of Patients With Advanced/Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of masitinib in combination with gemcitabine to placebo in combination with gemcitabine in patients with advanced/metastatic pancreatic cancer.
Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: Masitinib|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Gemcitabine
Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as time in months from the randomization date to the date of death due to any cause. If a patient is not known to have died, then OS will be censored at the date of last known date patient alive., From day of randomization to the date of death, assessed up to 60 months
Survival rate, Defined as the proportion of patients alive at each time point, estimated with Kaplan-Meier distribution., Every 24 weeks, assessed up to 60 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression Free Survival is defined as the time from the randomization date until the date of earliest evidence of disease progression or death, for participants who progressed or died before subsequent cancer therapy. Disease progression will be assessed by the investigator on CT scan according to RECIST 1.1 criteria., From day of randomization to disease progression or death, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months
Human pancreatic cancer overexpresses a number of important tyrosine kinase (TK) growth factors receptors and ligands, including expression of both PDGF and PDGF receptors. Drugs that can selectively inhibit TKs are likely to be of benefit in pancreatic cancer. Masitinib is a TK inhibitor, selectively and effectively inhibiting c-Kit (mast cell growth factor receptor), PDGF receptor, FGF receptor and to a lower extent the FAK kinases. Pre-clinical and clinical studies have shown that masitinib can reverse resistance of pancreatic tumor cell lines to gemcitabine. Based on pre-clinical and phase 2 clinical studies, masitinib can be considered as a good candidate to use in combination with gemcitabine in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.
