East Asian Breast Cancer Genome Atlas and Recurrence Risk Prediction
This project aims to establish the cancer genome atlas and the platform of recurrence risk prediction specific for East Asian breast cancer patients. The study was planned to collect blood sample, fresh tumor tissue, and paraffin embedded tumor tissue from 2000 patients. Aims to identify unique genetic alterations in Asian tumors, to identify the susceptible genes for breast carcinogenesis in East Asia, and to establish the new platform for accurate prediction of recurrence. The investigator will explore the association of patient outcomes with the genetic alterations from the cancer atlas of East Asian breast tumors.
