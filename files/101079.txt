American Ginseng Extract in Preventing Respiratory Infection and in Reducing Antibiotic Use in Patients With CLL
RATIONALE: American ginseng extract may prevent or reduce acute respiratory illness in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. It is not yet known whether American ginseng extract is more effective than a placebo in preventing respiratory infections.

PURPOSE: This randomized trial is studying the side effects of American ginseng extract and to see how well it works compared with a placebo in preventing respiratory infection and in reducing antibiotic use in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: American ginseng|DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Placebo
Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) Days, An ARI day was defined as any day for which the subject experienced one or more respiratory symptoms (cough, sore throat, nasal or sinus congestion, or runny nose) and one or more systemic symptoms (feverishness, chills/sweats, myalgia (muscle aches), fatigue, headache, poor endurance or increased shortness of breath) between January and March., 3 months
Number of Antibiotic Use Days, An antibiotic day was defined as a day on which the subject took one or more antibiotics between January and March., 3 months
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To assess the effect of American ginseng extract on the number of days of acute respiratory infection (ARI) during the peak respiratory illness season (January-March) in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).
* To determine the safety of American ginseng extract in these patients evaluated according to NCI CTCAE v3.0.

Secondary

* To assess the effect of this treatment on antibiotic use days (AUDs).
* To assess the effect of this treatment on the rate of all infections diagnosed by a physician.
* To assess the effect of this treatment on the duration and severity of each ARI episode.
* To assess the effect of this treatment on major infections defined as infection severe enough to require hospitalization or intravenous antibiotics.
* To assess the effect of this treatment on the incidence of herpes zoster infection defined as an episode of physician-diagnosed zoster infection.
* To assess the effect of this treatment on CLL disease activity (i.e., serum IgG, total lymphocyte count, platelet count, and Rai staging).
* To determine the incidence of ARI and type of illness in an untreated cohort of CLL patients over an entire winter respiratory illness season (January 1- April 30).

Tertiary

* To determine the effect of this treatment on the incidence of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus confirmed by a physician.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to antibiotic prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (yes vs no), serum IgG (≤ 500 mg/dL vs \> 500 mg/dL), and influenza vaccine status (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

* Arm I: Patients receive oral American ginseng extract twice daily.
* Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily. Treatment in both arms continues for up to 4 months in the absence of illness or adverse events.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks by phone.
