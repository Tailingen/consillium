P1101 in Treating Patients With Early PMF or Overt PMF at Low or Intermediate-1 Risk
This is a phase 3 double-blind clinical trial arm to test Ropeginterferon alfa-2b (P1101) in adult patients with Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF) at early stage or low to medium risk.

Participants will receive the study drug/placebo bi-weekly and have an assessment visit every 4 weeks. The ratio of study drug to placebo group is 2:1.

No progression is defined as:

* The participants who still have a TSS score equal to or less than (≤) 10 If the baseline score is ≤ 10.
* The participants with a TSS score no increase than 50% If the baseline score is greater than (\&amp;amp;gt;) 10., 56 weeks or 80 weeks
