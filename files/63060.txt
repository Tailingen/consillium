CyberKnife Accelerated Hemilarynx Stereotactic Radiotherapy Study for Early-stage Glottic Larynx Cancer
The feasibility of reducing fractions in early-stage laryngeal cancer has not previously been prospectively studied, and we will therefore conduct a careful phase I bio-equivalent dose fraction reduction study.
Early-stage Glottic Larynx Cancer
RADIATION: CyberKnife Accelerated Hemilarynx Stereotactic Radiotherapy
Fraction, To determine the feasibility of fraction reduction for early-stage laryngeal cancer without exceeding the maximum tolerated dose., 90 days
overall survival, To determine overall survival at 5 years, 5 years|loco-regional control, To determine loco-regional control at 5 years as determined by physical exam, visualization of tumor by layngoscopy, and CT-scan of the neck to determine if the primary tumor is controlled. A tissue biopsy or recurrent or persistent disease will be required to be considered a loco-regional failure., 5 years|functional voice quality, To characterize functional voice quality of patients treated on this protocol., 18 months|Quality of Life, To characterize the HR-QoL and PRO of patients treated on this protocol., 18 months|cost-effectiveness, To determine cost-effectiveness of hypofractionated larynx irradiation, 18 months|late toxicity, To determine late toxicity as defined as treatment-related toxicity occurring â‰¥ 18 months from completion of radiation therapy., 18 months
Patients enrolled at each dose level will undergo routine evaluations to identify potential toxicities as well functional voice analyses. Adequate waiting periods will be used to ensure that fraction reduction does not proceed prior to observing toxicity. The purpose of the study will be either to determine the maximal fraction reduction possible until a dose is reached where a dose-limiting toxicity occurs. The initial dose and fractionation will be 50 Gy in 15 fractions with the goal to reduce number of fractions to a dose of 42.5 Gy in 5 fractions. The rationale for using 5 fractions is that it is tolerated in centrally located lung tumors at a dose of 50 Gy in 5 fractions, and thus, is likely to be tolerated in large calliber airways.
