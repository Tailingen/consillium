An Investigation of Chemotherapy Induced Cognitive Impairments in Breast Cancer Survivors
The main goal of this project is to identify and remediate the cognitive difficulties, including processing speed and attention deficits in individuals who have undergone chemotherapy treatment. Recent research has demonstrated objective cognitive deficits following chemotherapy and that it is not an emotional reaction to the cancer diagnosis as it was once considered. There are a large number of woman diagnosed and treated for breast cancer that experience chemotherapy induced cognitive deficits.

Subjects who participate in the study will be evaluated for cognitive abilities prior to chemotherapy treatment and after completion of chemotherapy. Participants will then have the option to participate in the second phase of the study, which involves the use of a computer-based Brain Fitness Program for 12 weeks. This is followed by another cognitive evaluation.

Change in Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR), The WTAR is a measure that reliably estimates levels of intelligence by asking the subject to read aloud the words on an established reading list., Difference from baseline to end of chemotherapy (approximately 4 months, depending on individual treatment); difference from end of chemotherapy to 12 weeks post-chemotherapy|Change in Processing Speed (PS), 1) The Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT), which assesses complex mental manipulation of verbally presented single digit numbers. The task requires the participant to mentally add and verbally express the last two numbers presented. There are 60 trials in each of the two sets of numbers that are presented at two different speeds; 2) Symbol-Digit Modality Test requires that the subject copies numbers that are paired with symbols within a specified time limit. The coding subtest involves processing speed, short term visual memory, psychomotor speed, visual perception and visual scanning ability. 3) The Stroop Test has three parts to it: the first task requires the participant to respond to every word as quickly as possible that is presented on the computer screen. The second task requires a response when the color word matches the meaning of the word. The third task requires a response when the color of the word does not match the meaning of the word., Difference from baseline to end of chemotherapy (approximately 4 months, depending on individual treatment); difference from end of chemotherapy to 12 weeks post-chemotherapy|Change in Executive Functions, The Trail Making Test, Part A \& B: are measures of visual search efficiency and set shifting while alternating between letters and numbers. Additionally, the Verbal Fluency subtest of the Delis-Kaplan Executive Functioning Scale (D-KEFS) will be used to measure semantic and phonemic fluency through a task of word naming, where subjects are asked to list as many words as they can within 60-second time limit that begin with a specific letter (i.e., F, A, and S), and a task of category naming, where subjects are asked to list as many words as they can within 60-second time limit that fall within a specified category (i.e., animals and boy's names), respectfully. This subtest also measures category switching ability via a task where subjects are asked to list as many words as they can within 60-second time that fall within two alternating categories (i.e., fruits/furniture)., Difference from baseline to end of chemotherapy (approximately 4 months, depending on individual treatment); difference from end of chemotherapy to 12 weeks post-chemotherapy|Change in Working Memory and Attention, 1) Digit-Span Task, this is a standardized measure of verbal working memory in which participants recall a string of numbers that are verbally presented. 2) The Continuous Performance subtest of the CNS Vital Signs neurocognitive battery. The Continuous Performance test assesses sustained attention and reaction time to targets presented on the computer by requiring the participant to respond only when a specific designated letter is presented during a 5 minute trial. 3) The Shifting Attention subtest of the CNS- Vital Signs neurocognitive battery will be administered to assess the participant's ability to maintain attention while switching between sets of target. 4) Four-Parts Continuous performance subtest of the CNS Vital Signs neurocognitive battery, which is a measure of working memory and sustained attention., Difference from baseline to end of chemotherapy (approximately 4 months, depending on individual treatment); difference from end of chemotherapy to 12 weeks post-chemotherapy|Change in Visual and Verbal Memory, Verbal memory will be assessed with the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT-II) which assesses learning and rote memory of verbal material. Subjects are verbally presented with a list of words that are assessed immediately and after a 20-minute delay with and without cues. The short form version of this test will be used. The Visual Memory subtest of the CNS- Vital Signs neurocognitive battery will be administered to assess non-verbal memory of immediate and delayed recall., Difference from baseline to end of chemotherapy (approximately 4 months, depending on individual treatment); difference from end of chemotherapy to 12 weeks post-chemotherapy|Change in Depression, Beck Depression Inventory -II: This is a standardized instrument for the assessment of depression with a self-report questionnaire. Participants will endorse the level of disturbance which best describe their mood over 21 items that are characteristic of depression., Difference from baseline to end of chemotherapy (approximately 4 months, depending on individual treatment); difference from end of chemotherapy to 12 weeks post-chemotherapy|Change in Anxiety, Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI): The BAI is a self-report instrument for the assessment of anxiety. The BAI consists of 21 items, each describing a common symptom of anxiety on which the respondent rates how much they have been bothered by the symptoms over the last week., Difference from baseline to end of chemotherapy (approximately 4 months, depending on individual treatment); difference from end of chemotherapy to 12 weeks post-chemotherapy|Change in Frontal Systems Behavior Scale (FRSBE), A validated self-report of three frontal systems behavioral syndromes: apathy, disinhibition, and executive dysfunction., Difference from baseline to end of chemotherapy (approximately 4 months, depending on individual treatment); difference from end of chemotherapy to 12 weeks post-chemotherapy|Change in Cognitive Self-Report Questionnaire (CSRQ), A validated self-report questionnaire that assesses perceptions of cognition and mood related to everyday experiences for the past two weeks, Difference from baseline to end of chemotherapy (approximately 4 months, depending on individual treatment); difference from end of chemotherapy to 12 weeks post-chemotherapy|Change in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Scale (FACT-Cog), Measures patient's perceived cognitive functioning as a result of their diagnosis and cancer therapy., Difference from baseline to end of chemotherapy (approximately 4 months, depending on individual treatment); difference from end of chemotherapy to 12 weeks post-chemotherapy|Change in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Fatigue scale (FACIT-F), A measure of one's perception of their level of Fatigue as a result to cancer therapy., Difference from baseline to end of chemotherapy (approximately 4 months, depending on individual treatment); difference from end of chemotherapy to 12 weeks post-chemotherapy
