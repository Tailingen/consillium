Vaccine Therapy and Sargramostim Compared With Placebo and Sargramostim Following Rituximab in Treating Patients With Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Vaccines made from a person's cancer cells may make the body build an immune response to kill cancer cells. Colony-stimulating factors such as GM-CSF increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow and peripheral blood. It is not yet known whether combining rituximab and GM-CSF with vaccine therapy may cause a stronger immune response and kill more cancer cells.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying giving rituximab and GM-CSF together with vaccine therapy and comparing it to giving rituximab and GM-CSF alone in treating patients with newly diagnosed, relapsed, or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Compare time to disease progression in patients with grade 1, 2, or 3 follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who respond (i.e., complete or partial response, or stable disease) to treatment with rituximab and are then treated with sargramostim (GM-CSF) with vs without autologous immunoglobulin idiotype-KLH conjugate vaccine.

Secondary

* Compare response rate improvement in patients treated with these regimens.
* Compare overall complete response rate in patients treated with these regimens.
* Compare duration of response in patients treated with these regimens.
* Determine the safety of these regimens in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior treatment (yes vs no) and response to rituximab during study (complete response \[CR\] or partial response \[PR\] vs stable disease \[SD\]).

All patients receive rituximab IV once weekly for 4 weeks. Five weeks after the last dose of rituximab, patients are assessed for response. Patients with progressive disease are removed from the study and do not undergo randomization. Patients with a CR, PR, or SD are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

* Arm I: Patients receive autologous immunoglobulin idiotype-KLH conjugate vaccine subcutaneously (SC) on day 1. Patients also receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) SC on days 1-4.
* Arm II: Patients receive placebo SC on day 1. Patients also receive GM-CSF SC on days 1-4.

In both arms, treatment repeats monthly for 6 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or clinically significant progressive disease. After the first 6 months, patients with a CR, PR, or SD may continue to receive treatment (per treatment arm as above) every 2 months for 1 year (total of 6 doses) and then every 3 months thereafter in the absence of disease progression.

Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months until disease progression.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 342 evaluable patients (171 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 18 months.
