Anemia is considered to be one of the most prevalent cytopenias in patients who have myelodysplastic syndromes, an umbrella term used to describe disorders relating to the ineffective production of red blood cells, white blood cells, and/or platelets. Ranging in severity from mild (asymptomatic) to severe, anemia can result in patients requiring regular red blood cell (RBC) transfusions, which can lead to further complications from iron overload. The goal of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of luspatercept versus placebo in anemic patients who are categorized as International Prognostic Scoring System-Revised (IPSS-R) very low, low, or intermediate risk Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), have ring sideroblasts present, and require constant RBC transfusions. The design of the study will allow a period of initial randomization of patients into either the luspatercept or placebo arm, followed by a double-blind treatment period, and then an MDS disease assessment visit. For those patients that are determined to be experiencing clinical benefit as judged from the study Investigator by this disease assessment visit, they will be permitted to enter the double-blind Extension Phase of the study. Once patients are discontinued from study treatment, they will enter a post treatment follow-up period.
