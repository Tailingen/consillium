Lidocaine Infusion in Pancreatic Cancer
This study elucidates the effects of the intravenous (IV) lidocaine infusion on the biology of pancreatic circulating tumor cells (CTCs) isolated from patients undergoing robotic pancreatectomy for all types of pancreatic cancer.

A prospective randomized controlled double blinded trial design will be used for the proposed study.

Specimen outcome measure., Src Tyrosine Kinase Enzymatic activity in CTCs. Fluorescence intensity will be used to measure Src phosphorylation in circulating tumor cells., Outcomes will be evaluated perioperatively|Specimen outcome measure., Cytokine Levels in Serum (pg/ml), Outcomes will be evaluated perioperatively|Specimen outcome measure., Chemokine levels in serum (pg/ml), Outcomes will be evaluated perioperatively|Upregulation or Downregulation of Gene Expression., Upregulation or downregulation of gene expression will be measured with the Real Time (RT) square Profiler Polimerase Chain Reaction (PCR )Array Analysis, and Real Time PCR, Outcomes will be evaluated perioperatively
Specimen outcome measure, CTCs Enumeration, Perioperatively
The primary objective of this study is to determine the effect of IV lidocaine infusion on various enzymatic activities and associated pathways in isolated CTCs as well as the number of CTCs during the perioperative period in patients undergoing robotic pancreatectomy for pancreatic cancer. It is expected that by downregulating the pathways by lidocaine might affect the enzymatic activity in those CTCs as well as the number of CTCs in the circulation.

A prospective randomized controlled double blinded trial design will be used for the proposed study.

Patients undergoing robotic pancreatectomy for pancreatic cancer will be randomized (ratio 1:1) into two groups: one group will receive a 24-h normal saline infusion and the second group will receive a 24-h lidocaine infusion. Blood samples will be collected in different times perioperatively in order to evaluate the objectives of the study.
