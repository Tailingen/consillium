Dual-targeting HER2 and PD-L1 CAR-T for Solid Tumors
CAR-T therapy has achieved unprecedented success in hematological tumors in recent years, but the progress of CAR-T cells in the treatment of solid tumors is facing difficulties. HER-2 is frequently expressed in breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, gastric cancer and other malignant tumors. In this study, the PD-L1 inhibitory signal was transformed into an activation signal in the tumor microenvironment, and enhanced the killing activity and survival ability of CAR-T cells. The HER-2/PD-L1 dual-targeting CAR-T will be investigated in patients with HER2-positive solid tumors, and all enrolled subjects will receive HER2/PD-L1 CAR T cells via intravenous or thoracic/peritoneal cavity infusion.
