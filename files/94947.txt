Atezolizumab Plus Induction Chemotherapy Plus CT-radiotherapy. (APOLO)
Open-label, non-randomized, phase II multi-centre controlled clinical trial.

51 non-resectable stage IIIA-IIIB non-small cell lung cancer patients will be enrolled in this trial to evaluate the efficacy of the treatment (Atezolizumab + Induction chemotherapy (CT) + CT-Radiotherapy) in terms of the Progression Free Survival at 12 months

This is an open-label, non-randomized, phase II multi-centre controlled clinical trial.The total sample size is 51 patients. The population to be included are non-resectable stage IIIA-IIIB non-small cell lung cancer patients.

Patients randomised will receive induction treatment (Atezolizumab 1200mg+ Carboplatin AUC5+Paclitaxel 200 mg/m2 for 3 cycles) and concurrent chemotherapy (CT) -radiotherapy treatment for 3 cycles. At the end of concurrent treatment Atezolizumab 1200mg maintenance treatment will start and will be administered for 12 months (16 cycles).

The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of the treatment (Atezolizumab + Induction chemotherapy (CT) + CT-Radiotherapy) in terms of the Progression Free Survival (PFS) at 12 months according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1.

PFS are defined as the time from inclusion until objective tumor progression or death.

Patient accrual is expected to be completed within 2 years, treatment is planned to extend during 1.5 years and the patients will be followed up for 2 years. The study will end once survival follow-up has concluded.
