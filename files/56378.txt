Pegaspargase-COEP Chemotherapy Combined With Radiotherapy for Extra-nodal NK/T Cell Lymphoma
The optimal first-line treatment for extra-nodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL) has not been well-defined. This phase II study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pegaspargase, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, etoposide and prednisone (COEPL) regimen combined with radiotherapy for patients with newly diagnosed ENKTL.
