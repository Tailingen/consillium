Obinutuzumab Combined With Bendamustine in the Treatment of Mature B-cell Lymphoma
This is a prospective, single-center, single-arm clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of maintenance therapy with obinutuzumab for 2 years in patients ≥ 18 years of age with newly diagnosed mature B-cell lymphoma (including follicular lymphoma\[FL\], marginal zone cell lymphoma\[MZL\] , waldenström macroglobulinemia\[WM\], hairy-cell leukemia variant\[HCL-v\]) who achieved ≥ PR after 6 cycles of obinutuzumab in combination with bendamustine.
B Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Obinutuzumab Combined With Bendamustine
Overall Remission Rate(ORR), Disease response evaluation after 6 cycles will be used to determine the overall remission rate, 24 weeks
Progression Free Survival, Progression free survival is defined as the time from the day in which the patient is enrolled to the date on which tumor progresses or the date on which the patient dies for any cause. Responding patients and patients who are lost to follow up will be censored at their last tumor assessment date., up to 4.5 years|Event-Free Survival, Event-Free Survival will be measured from the date of inclusion to the date of first documented disease progression, relapse, initiation of new anti-lymphoma therapy or death from any cause., up to 4.5 years|Complete Response Rate, Disease response evaluation after 6 cycles will be used to determine the overall remission rate, 24 weeks|Overall survival, Overall survival will be measured from the date of inclusion to the date of death from any cause.

Alive patients will be censored at their last date known to be alive, up to 4.5 years
This study will explore whether induction therapy with obinutuzumab in combination with bendamustine followed by maintenance therapy with obinutuzumab in treatment-naïve patients with mature B-cell lymphoma will improve the prognosis of patients with this type of indolent mature B-cell lymphoma and the efficacy and safety of this regimen in different lymphoma subtypes.
