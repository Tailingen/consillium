Previous studies have found that PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors combined with CTLA-4 inhibitors have better efficacy than PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors alone. Anti-angiogenesis targeted drugs can enhance the anti-tumor effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors by reducing the activity of immunosuppressive cells and normalizing tumor vascular structure, and its combination with immunotherapy has become a standard regimen in liver cancer. Based on the above, this study aims to explore the efficacy and safety of SHR-8068 and adbelizumab combined with bevacizumab in the treatment of MSS type of metastatic colorectal cancer.
