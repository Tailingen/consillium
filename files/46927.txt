The Study of Olaparib in Newly Diagnosed mCRPC Patients With HRR Gene Mutation
This is a multi-center, single-arm, prospective study to assess the efficacy and safety of Olaparib in men with newly diagnosed metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who carried homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene mutations and have progressed after treatment with novel endocrine agents (NHA) in the metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer or non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

A total of 30 newly diagnosed mCRPC subjects with radiologically evaluable disease at baseline who have progressed on prior NHA and carry HRR gene mutations that meet the criteria will be included in the study. Eligible subjects will receive a treatment regimen of oral Olaparib tablets 300 mg twice daily until disease progression or intolerance. During the treatment and follow-up periods, all subjects will have regular visits to assess the efficacy and safety of Olaparib. Data on objective radiographic response (ORR), prostate-specific antigen response (PSA response), radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), and time to prostate-specific antigen progression (TTPP) will be collected during the study.
Prostate Cancer|Prostate Carcinoma|Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Olaparib
Primary Outcome Measures 1, 1. To assess the efficacy of Olaparib in newly diagnosed metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with mutations in homologous recombination repair genes that have progressed after prior treatment with novel endocrine agents.

-The Overall response rate will be based on the following outcome definitions and a patient will be considered a response if any of these occur:

(1) Objective response (ORR) according to RECIST 1.1 (soft tissue), up to 60 months|Primary Outcome Measures 2, Objective response (ORR) according to PCWG-3 (bone) criteria as determined by the local investigator, up to 60 months|Primary Outcome Measures 3, PSA response will be reported in ng/mL (â‰¥ 50% reduction in PSA from baseline) according to PCWG 3 criteria as determined by the local investigator, up to 60 months
Secondary Outcome Measures 1, Investigator-assessed confirmed radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) will be reported in weeks per RECIST 1.1 (soft tissue) and PCWG3 (bone), up to 60 months|Secondary Outcome Measures 2, Investigator-assessed confirmed disease control rate (DCR) per RECIST 1.1 (soft tissue) and PCWG3 (bone), up to 60 months|Secondary Outcome Measures 3, Investigator-assessed confirmed the time to PSA progression (TTPP) per PCWG3, up to 60 months|Secondary Outcome Measures 3, 2. To assess the safety and tolerability of Olaparib in newly diagnosed metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with homologous recombination repair gene mutations that have progressed after prior treatment with novel endocrine agent.

-Adverse events/Serious adverse events/AE of special interest, up to 60 months
Other Outcome Measures, To explore the concordance rate of tissue samples and plasma ct-DNA samples by second-generation sequencing (NGS) testing

-Concordance rate between tissue and plasma ct-DNA testing results, up to 60 months
