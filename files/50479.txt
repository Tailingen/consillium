Local Therapy in Advanced NSCLC With Non-progressive Disease (PD) After First Line Therapy
This is a prospective single arme real-world study clinical study, which aims to investigate the overall benefit and safety of consolidative therapy in advanced NSCLC (stage III/IV) patients , who do not progress after front line systemic therapy (chemotherapy, target therapy or immunological checkpoint inhibitors).

It is required that pathological diagnosis and genetic profile including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and ROS proto-oncogene 1 (ROS1) be established prior to enrollment. Standard front line systemic should be given according to clinical practice. Molecular targeting drugs for patients with driving mutations should be acquired legally. Patients without driving mutations should undergo standard first line chemotherapy and or immunological checkpoint inhibitors. One cycle is three weeks and response evaluation is done every two cycles. CR, PR and SD should be confirmed after four cycles of therapy.

Patients, who achieve non-PD after four cycles of treatment, with distant metastasis involving no more than five total metastatic lesions, will be screened and enrolled.
