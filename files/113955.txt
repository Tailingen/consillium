The Effects of T4 Versus T4/T3 on Psychological Distress After Total Thyroidectomy in Thyroid Cancer Patients
The goal of this research is to compare the effects on psychological distress between T4 mono replacement group and T4/T3 combination replacement group after total thyroidectomy in thyroid cancer patients.

1. Subjects:

   * Psychologically distressed patients, such as depression, anxiety, and fatigue patient after total thyroidectomy with thyroid cancer are considered for participation. Screening of distress after total thyroidectomy is used HADS (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) ≥ 8 for depression or anxiety, and MDASI-F (MD Anderson Symptom Inventory -Fatigue) ≥ 4 for fatigue.
2. Randomization:

   * Using the table of random sampling numbers, patients assign to T4 mono replacement group or T4/T3 combination replacement group.
3. Evaluation for distress:

   * Assessment will be made baseline, 4 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks to investigate change of psychological distress (depression, anxiety, and fatigue). Level of distress after thyroidectomy will determine using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) for depression or anxiety, and Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) for fatigue.
