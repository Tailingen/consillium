Investigation of GSK2879552 in Subjects With Relapsed/Refractory Small Cell Lung Carcinoma
GSK2879552 is a potent, selective, mechanism-based inactivator of Lysine Specific Demethylase 1 (LSD1)/ CoRepressor for Element-1-Silencing Transcription factor (CoREST) activity. This is a phase I, open-label, multi-center, non-randomized, 2-part first time in human (FTIH) study for GSK2879552. Part 1 is a dose escalation phase to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for GSK2879552 based on the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) profiles observed after oral administration of GSK2879552. Any dose level(s) may be expanded up to 12 subjects in order to collect additional data on PK and PD.The safety and PK/PD data will be reviewed prior to the dose decision, and the dose escalation will be guided by the Neuenschwander -continuous reassessment method (N-CRM). Built-in safety constraints are in place to prevent exposing subjects to undue risk of toxicity. Once RP2D is identified, an expansion cohort (Part 2) of up to 30 subjects will be enrolled to further evaluate the clinical activity and tolerability of GSK2879552 in subjects with relapsed/refractory SCLC.
