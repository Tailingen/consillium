Adjuvant Regional Nodal Radiation Therapy for One Week in Breast Cancer
The purpose of this trial is to investigate the toxicities and efficacy of super hypofractionated regional nodal radiotherapy (RNI) for one week in breast cancer patients treated with mastectomy or breast conserving surgery. Super hypofractionated radiotherapy will be delivered to chest wall or whole breast and regional lymph regions (including supraclavicular/infraclavicular region, internal mammary nodes, and any part of the axillary bed at risk). Eligible breast cancer patients will be followed for at least 5 years to evaluate the acute and late radiation-induced toxicities, locoregional recurrence, over survival, distant metastasis, and quality of life.

RADIATION: External Beam radiotherapy using IMRT technique
Cumulative complication rate of ≥Grade 2 Acute Radiation-induced Toxicity, Within time from the beginning of radiotherapy to 6 months after completion of radiotherapy, any acute radiation-induced toxicities will be assessed and recorded after the last fraction using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 3.0., 6 months
Cumulative complication rate of ≥Grade 2 Late Radiation-induced Toxicity, Within time from 6 months after completion of radiotherapy to 5 years after completion of radiotherapy, any late toxicity will be assessed and recorded using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) /European Organization for Research on Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Late Radiation Morbidity Scoring Schema and CTCAE 3.0, 5 years|Number of Participants with excellent or good Cosmetic outcomes following breast conserving surgery-Harvard/ NSABP/RTOG scoring scale, The cosmetic outcomes will be evaluated at 6 months after last fractions. The cosmetic outcomes are evaluated based on the Allegheny General Modification of the Harvard/National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP)/ RTOG scoring scale which graded patients into the following four classifications: excellent, when compared to the untreated breast, there is a minimal or no difference in the size or shape of the treated breast; good, slight difference in the size or shape of the treated breast; fair, obvious difference in the size or shape of the treated breast; and poor, marked change in the size or shape of the treated breast, 6 months|Number of Participants with excellent or good Cosmetic outcomes following breast conserving surgery-Harvard/ NSABP/RTOG scoring scale, The cosmetic outcomes will be evaluated at 5 years after last fractions.

Quality of Life-EORTC QLQ-C30, Quality of life will be assessed before radiotherapy and 6 months after last fractions using self administered questionnaire EORTC QLQ-C30, 6 months|Quality of Life-EORTC BR-23, Quality of life will be assessed before radiotherapy and 6 months after last fractions using self administered questionnaire EORTC QLQ-BR23, 6 months|Quality of Life-EORTC QLQ-C30, Quality of life will be assessed before radiotherapy and 5 years after last fractions using self administered questionnaire EORTC QLQ-C30, 5 years|Quality of Life-EORTC BR-23, Quality of life will be assessed before radiotherapy and 5 years after last fractions using self administered questionnaire EORTC QLQ-BR23, 5 years
Eligible breast cancer patients will receive super hypofractionated radiotherapy of 5.2 Gy in 5 fractions within one week and a sequential tumor bed boost of 5.2 Gy in 2 fractions to the conserved breast. The dose is prescribed to ipsilateral chest wall or whole breast and regional lymph regions (including supraclavicular/infraclavicular region, internal mammary nodes, and any part of the axillary bed at risk). All patients are treated with intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) technique or intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT). The primary endpoint is ≥2 grade any acute radiation induced toxicity event. Patients will be followed for at least 5 years to evaluate the acute and late radiation-induced toxicity, locoregional recurrence, over survival, distant metastasis, and quality of life.

Calculation of the required number of cases based on an alpha of 0.05 and a power of 80% with a maximal tolerable toxicity difference of 10% during and within 6 months after RNI comparing to conventional radiotherapy and lost rate of follow up of 10%. In total 197 patients are needed to be recruited.
