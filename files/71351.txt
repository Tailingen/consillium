Impact of Cerebellar Mass Resection on Pain Processing
The purpose of the study is to evaluate how cerebellar resection surgery may affect pain sensation and the way the brain "reads" pain signals. By measuring brain activity in children and adolescents following surgery, the investigators hope to gain valuable information about pain processing in the brain.

Increase in blood oxygen level dependent signal response, Functional magnetic resonance imaging scans will be collected to measure blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) responses, an indirect measure measure of neural activity. The Unit of Measure is % BOLD signal change across spatiotemporal domains within the brain., Baseline, Day 1

This study is designed to test whether cerebellar resection surgery affects pain pathways in the brain. To participate a participant must (A) have had a cerebellar mass surgically removed, or (B) are a healthy volunteer with no history of pain disorders or mental illness. The study will involve sensory testing and brain imaging using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Sensory testing will be performed using a tub of cold water, as well as a contact thermode capable of delivering hot and cold temperatures. MRI brain scanning uses magnetic fields and radio waves to give pictures of the brain without using radiation.
