A Phase I Study of BRY812 for Injection Alone in Subjects With Advanced Malignancies
This is a Phase I, multicenter, open-label, single-arm and first-in-human clinical study of BRY812 for injection. The study objectives are to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic profile, anti-tumor activity and immunogenicity of BRY812 for injection in patients with advanced malignancies.

Patients will receive treatment every 3 weeks until intolerable toxicity, disease progression, pregnancy, withdrawal of informed consent, death, study discontinuation, or withdrawal from the study.
Advanced Malignancies
DRUG: BRY812 for injection
Incidence of adverse events, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigational subjct administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment., From Day 1 to 30 days after last dose; approximately 2 years|Incidence of laboratory abnormalities, To be summarized using descriptive statistics, From Day 1 to 30 days after last dose; approximately 2 year|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of BRY812 for injection, Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of BRY812 for injection, From the first dose to the last dose；approximately 2 year|Recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of BRY812 for injection, Recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of BRY812 for injection, From the first dose to the last dose；approximately 2 year|Incidence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), Incidence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), Through 21 days after first dose
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST v1.1., Through 1 month following last dose; approximately 2 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from start of study treatment to first documentation of tumor progression (clinical progression or PD per RECIST v1.1)., Up to approximately 3 years|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from start of study treatment to date of death due to any cause, Up to approximately 3 years|Duration of response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from start of the first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR) to the first documentation of tumor progression (clinical progression or progressive disease (PD) per RECIST v1.1), Up to approximately 3 years|Pharmacokinetic assessment, The concentrations of BRY812, total antibody and free monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) in blood will be determined, and the following parameters will be calculated respectively., Through 18 weeks after dosing|Immunogenicity assessment, The anti-drug antibody (ADA) of BRY812 in the blood is detected, and the antibody titer of ADA-positive patients is further detected according to the situation, and whether they have neutralizing antibody (NAb) is detected if necessary., Through 18 weeks after dosing
