A Study of TY-2136b in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors Harboring ALK, ROS1 or NTRK1-3 Alterations
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of TY-2136b and to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), with dose-escalation stage and dose-expansion stage.

* To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics of TY-2136b after single and multiple oral doses.
* To assess preliminary antitumor activity of TY-2136b as a single agent when administered orally to patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
* To identify mutations in the ALK, ROS1 and NTRK1-3, or other molecular alterations in blood or tumor tissues associated with clinical outcome.
