A Study of Olaratumab in Japanese Participants With Advanced Cancer
This study consists of 2 parts (Part A and Part B). The main purpose of Part A is to evaluate safety and side effects of olaratumab in combination with doxorubicin in Japanese participants with a group of rare cancers (advanced solid tumors, especially advanced soft tissue sarcoma \[STS\].) The main purpose of Part B is to evaluate how much olaratumab gets into the blood stream of Japanese participants with advanced solid tumors and how long it takes the body to get rid of it.
Neoplasm
BIOLOGICAL: Olaratumab|DRUG: Doxorubicin
Part A: Number of Participants With One or More Serious Adverse Event(s) (SAEs) Considered by the Investigator to be Related to Study Drug Administration, Clinically significant events were defined as serious adverse events (SAE).

A summary of other nonserious AEs, and all serious adverse events (SAE's), regardless of causality, is located in the Reported Adverse Events section., Cycle 1 (21 Days)|Part B: Pharmacokinetics: Maximum Observed Concentration (Cmax) of Olaratumab, Maximum observed serum concentration (Cmax) of olaratumab is reported., Cycle (C) 1 Day (D) 1 and C3 D1: Pre-infusion, Immediately postinfusion and 1, 24, 48, 72 and 168 hours (h) postinfusion; C1 D8 and C3 D8: Pre- infusion, Immediately postinfusion and 1, 48, 72, 168 and 336 h postinfusion|Part B: Pharmacokinetics: Area Under the Concentration-time Curve (AUC) of Olaratumab, AUC(0-t) hours (h), area under the serum concentration versus time curve from time zero to t hours at AUC(0-168h) for Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 3 Day 1, AUC(0-336h) for Cycle 1 Day 8 and Cycle 3 Day 8 of Olaratumab is reported., Cycle (C) 1 Day (D) 1 and C3 D1: Pre-infusion, Immediately postinfusion and 1, 24, 48, 72 and 168 hours (h) postinfusion; C1 D8 and C3 D8: Pre- infusion, Immediately postinfusion and 1, 48, 72, 168 and 336 h postinfusion
Part A: Pharmacokinetics: Maximum Observed Concentration (Cmax) of Olaratumab, Maximum observed serum concentration (Cmax) of olaratumab is reported., Cycle (C) 1 Day (D) 1 and C3 D1: Pre-infusion, Immediately postinfusion and 1.5, 24, 48, 72 and 168 hours (h) postinfusion; C1 D8 and C3 D8: Pre- infusion, Immediately postinfusion and 1, 48, 72, 168 and 336 h postinfusion|Part A: Pharmacokinetics: Area Under the Concentration-time Curve (AUC) of Olaratumab, AUC(0-t) hours (h), area under the serum concentration versus time curve from time zero to t hours at AUC(0-168h) for Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 3 Day 1, AUC(0-336h) for Cycle 1 Day 8 and Cycle 3 Day 8 of Olaratumab is reported., Cycle (C) 1 Day (D) 1 and C3 D1: Pre-infusion, Immediately postinfusion and 1.5, 24, 48, 72 and 168 hours (h) postinfusion; C1 D8 and C3 D8: Pre- infusion, Immediately postinfusion and 1, 48, 72, 168 and 336 h postinfusion|Part A: Pharmacokinetics: Maximum Observed Concentration (Cmax) of Doxorubicin, Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) of doxorubicin is reported., Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 1 Day 2, Cycle 1 Day 3, Cycle 3 Day 1, Cycle 3 Day 2 and Cycle 3 Day 3: Immediately postinfusion|Part A: Pharmacokinetics: Maximum Observed Concentration (Cmax) of Doxorubicin, Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) of doxorubicin is reported., Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 3 Day 1: Immediately postinfusion, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, and 72 h postinfusion|Part A: Pharmacokinetics: Area Under the Concentration-time Curve (AUC) of Doxorubicin, Area under the concentration verses time curve from zero to infinity (AUC\[0-∞\]) of doxorubicin is reported., Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 3 Day 1: Immediately postinfusion, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, and 72 h postinfusion|Change From Baseline in Percentage of Participants With a Tumor Response, Tumor response was assessed according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria version 1.1. Complete Response (CR) is disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR) is greater than or equal to (≥) 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions., Baseline to Study completion (Up To 3.5 Years)
