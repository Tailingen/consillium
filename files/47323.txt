Systemic Chemotherapy Plus Lenvatinib and Toripalimab for HCC With Extrahepatic Metastasis
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Systemic chemotherapy of oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin plus lenvatinib and toripalimab in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma with extrahepatic metastasis
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: Systemic chemotherapy|DRUG: Lenvatinib|DRUG: Toripalimab
Progression free survival rate at 6 months, Progression was defined as progressive disease by independent radiologic review according to mRECIST or death from any cause, 6 months
Overall survival (OS), OS is the length of time from the date of randomization until death from any cause., 6 months|Progression free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first objectively documented tumor progression or death due to any cause., 6 months|Objective response rate (ORR), ORR, as determined based on tumor response according to mRECIST, is defined as the proportion of all randomized subjects whose best overall response (BOR) is either a CR or PR., 6 months|Adverse events, Safety will be evaluated according to the NCI CTCAE Version 4.03. All observations pertinent to the safety of the study medication will be recorded on the CRF and included in the final report., 6 months
Systemic chemotherapy of oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin was effective and safe for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Lenvatinib was non-inferior to sorafenib in overall survival in untreated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, and programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) antibody was effective and tolerable in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. No study has evaluated systemic chemotherapyplus lenvatinib and toripalimab. Thus, the investigators carried out this prospective, single-arm study to find out it.
