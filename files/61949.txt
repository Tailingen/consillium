Prospective Randomized Study of SILS Versus CLS for Rectal Cancer
Background: Single-port laparoscopic surgery is emerging as a method to improve morbidity and cosmetic benefits of conventional laparoscopic surgery and minimize the surgical trauma. However, the feasibility of this procedure in rectal surgery has not been determined yet. The aim of this study is to evaluate our initial experience using single port access in laparoscopic rectal surgery.

Design: randomized, prospective clinical study Patients: 40 patients
Rectal Cancer|Adenocarcinoma
PROCEDURE: Single Incision Laparoscopic Surgery
