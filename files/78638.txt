DEVICE: HistoSonics Edison™ System for the treatment of pancreatic adenocarcinoma using histotripsy
Evaluate the safety of the HistoSonics Edison System for the destruction of pancreatic adenocarcinomas using histotripsy, Index procedure-related complications ≤30 days post index procedure, graded using Clavien-Dindo Classification and Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). \[Clinical Events Committee Adjudicated\], 30 days post histotripsy procedure
This is a prospective multi-center, single-arm, feasibility trial designed to evaluate the safety of the HistoSonics Edison System for the destruction of pancreatic adenocarcinoma tumors in patients who are diagnosed with unresectable locally advanced (Stage 3) or oligometastatic disease (Stage 4).

The type of design is exploratory and is considered interventional. Following histotripsy, subjects will undergo imaging ≤36-hours post-index procedure. Additionally, subjects will be followed at 7-day, 14-day, 30-day, 60-day, 120-day, and 180-day timepoints.
