Breast Stereotactic Radiotherapy to Primary Tumors in Metastatic Patients
This is a dose escalation study involving stage IV breast cancer patients not progressing after 6 months of first line systemic treatment. Potential advantages of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in treating breast primary tumor in metastatic breast cancer are:

* radio-biological advantage of a short highly effective treatment schedule
* possibility of preventing lesions to become symptomatic
* possibility of continuing systemic treatment without interruption
Stage IV Breast Cancer
RADIATION: Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT)
Maximum tolerated dose of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), the dose of radiotherapy associated with a â‰¤ 20% rate pre-specified treatment-related dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) occurring within 6 months from the start of treatment. DLT is defined as any grade 3 or worse toxicity according to CTCAE v.4 related to the following specific symptoms:

* Radiation dermatitis grade \> 3
* Breast pain grade 3
* Breast infection grade \> 3
* Breast asymmetry grade 3
* Fibrosis grade \> 3
* Skin atrophy grade 3
* Rib fracture grade 3
* Chest wall pain grade 3, 6 months
