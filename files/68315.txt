Apatinib for Inoperable Advanced Chondrosarcoma
Anti-angiogenesis Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been proved to show promising effects on prolonging progression-free survival (PFS) for advanced chondrosarcoma after failure of standard multimodal Therapy. Methylsulfonic apatinib is one of those TKIs which specifically inhibits VEGFR-2. This study summarizes the experience of two Peking University affiliated hospitals in off-label use of apatinib in the treatment of extensively pre-treated chondrosarcoma.
