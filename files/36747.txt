The Correlation Between MAGE-A3, PRAME Polymorphism and Expression Levels of MAGE-A3 and PRAME in NSCLC Patients
Considering the low expression rate of Melanoma-associated antigen 3 (MAGE-A3) in Asian especially Southeast Asian, it would be great interests to investigate the potential polymorphism of MAGE-A3 in Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) patients in Taiwan. Meanwhile, it is also interesting to study the expression of Preferentially Expressed Antigen In Melanoma(PRAME) and Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status as well as to find out significant factors which may affect their expression such as smoking status, histological types, tumour size and stages in Taiwan.
