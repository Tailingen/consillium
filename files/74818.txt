Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Preliminary Anti-tumor Activity of ASKC202
This study is the first-in-human of ASKC202, which is an open-label, non-randomized, multicenter study with a dose escalation phase and a dose expansion phase.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: ASKC202
The incidence and case number of DLT (Dose Limiting Toxicity) during observation period, DLT is short for Dose Limiting Toxicity，dose-limiting describes side effects of a drug or other treatment that are serious enough to prevent an increase in dose or level of that treatment., up to 21 days following first dose|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD）, The MTD was defined as the highest dose of ASKC202 not causing DLT in more than 33% of patients in the first treatment cycle., up to 21 days following first dose|Number of participants with adverse events and serious adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, An AE was defined as any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. A serious AE was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect or was otherwise considered medically important. The term TEAE is defined as AEs starting or worsening after the first intake of the study drug. TEAEs include both Serious TEAEs and non-serious TEAEs. Number of Participants with TEAEs and serious TEAEs were reported., up to 30 days following last dose
Pharmacokinetics:maximum Plasma Concentration [Cmax], Serum samples will be collected for Cmax analysis., up to 21 days following first dose|Pharmacokinetics:terminal elimination half life (T1/2), Serum samples will be collected for T1/2 analysis., up to 21 days following first dose|Pharmacokinetics:Area Under Curve (AUC), Serum samples will be collected for AUC analysis., up to 21 days following first dose
This study is the first-in-human of ASKC202, which is an open-label, non-randomized, multicenter study with a dose escalation phase and a dose expansion phase.
