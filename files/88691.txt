Biomarkers of Early Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) in Smokers - Longitudinal Study
This is a longitudinal observational study to identify and validate protein biomarkers for COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases) and cardiovascular disease in smokers and ex-smokers attending primary care. Special emphasize is to correlate biomarkers to different phases of COPD, to progression of the disease, and to treatment of the disease. Furthermore, linkage between COPD, cardiovascular disease, and lung cancer will be investigated by identifying protein biomarkers.
