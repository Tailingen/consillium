Clomiphene Citrate Plus uFSH Versus Aromatase Inhibitor Plus uFSH in Clomiphene Resistant Infertile PCOS Women
Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a condition characterized by infertility, infrequent periods and amenorrhea or irregular bleeding plus anovulatory infertility. Clomid is the standard first drug of treatment for ovulation induction. Ovulation and conception will occur in approximately 75 and 30 percent of cases respectively. Cases not ovulating in response to doses of clomid up to 150 mg/day are known as clomid resistant PCOS.
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome|Infertility
DRUG: Aromatase inhibitor (litrezole) plus uFSH arm|DRUG: clomiphene citrate-uFSH arm
ovulation rate, percentage of ovulatory cycles per started and per completed cycles, 30 days
endometrial thickness, endmetrial thickness at time of ovulation triggering, 4 weeks|ongoing cycle pregnancy rate, 16 weeks
To test whether CC co- treatment with chronic low dose HP uFSH versus lirizole plus chronic low dose HP uFSH in CC resistant PCOS will yield comparable results in terms of, ovulation rate, lower follicle number, lower HP uFSH dose, better outcome in terms of pregnancy rates, better cost-effectiveness ratio, lower multiple pregnancy rates, lower cycle cancellation.
