XELOX With Capecitabine Maintenance or XELOX in Elderly Metastatic Adenocarcinoma of Stomach
To confirm the efficacy and safety of XELOX with capecitabine maintenance in treatment of elderly advanced gastric cancer (AGC) by comparing it with that of XELOX regimen.
Gastric Cancer
DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Capecitabine
Progression Free Survival (PFS), From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 12 months
overall survival (OS), from the date of randomization until death from any cause or up to 1 year|Response Rate (RR), evaluate every 6 weeks after the date of randomization until diease progress or up to 12 weeks|adverse events (AE), from date of randomization to 28 days after the last chemo dosage
health-related quality of life (HRQOL), evaluate every 6 weeks from the date of randomization until 28 days after the last chemo dosage|excision repair cross-complementing 1(ERCC1) expression, quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were performed to determine ERCC1 mRNA expression in tumor tissue., assays messager ribonucleic acid (mRNA) of ERCC1 expression in tumor tissue after randomization and before the first treatment|K-ras gene type, Genomic Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is extracted from tumor tissue, direct sequencing technique is used to test K-ras gene type(mutation or wild)., assess after randomization and before the first treatment
To investigate whether XELOX with capecitabine maintenance treatment as 1st line treatment in the elderly advanced gastric cancer is as effective and safe as XELOX regimen.
