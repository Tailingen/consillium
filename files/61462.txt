Randomized Clinical Trial of 8 Weeks Pulmonary Rehabilitation in Advanced Stage Lung Cancer Patients With COPD During Cytotoxic Chemotherapy
Pulmonary rehabilitation might be benificial in advanced lung cancer patients with COPD who undergo cytotoxic chemotherapy.

We will compare two groups, 8 week pulmonary rehabilitation group and usual care group.
