Pain Management in Cancer Patients Using a Mobile Application
The investigators have developed a mobile application (for use on smart phones) to help cancer patients better manage cancer pain. This study is a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of this mobile-based intervention. The investigators' hypothesis is that subjects randomized to the intervention group will have a reduction in pain and pain-related hospitalizations.
