Incisional Negative Pressure Wound Therapy for Resection of Soft Tissue Tumors
This study is aimed to examine the value of incisional negative pressure therapy after resection of soft tissue tumors. Its a prospective randomized trial comparing incisional negative pressure to standard wound dressings.
Soft Tissue Sarcoma|Lipoma|Tumor
OTHER: Incisional negative pressure wound therapy|OTHER: Wound dressing with adhesive tapes
Amount of drainage fluid, Measurement of total fluid amounts in drains and negative pressure device, up to 14 days postoperatively
Wound complications, Assessment of course of wound healing, necessary operative revisions, seroma formation, 3 months|Wound margin perfusion, Measurement with laser doppler, 5 days postoperatively
Wound healing after resection of large soft tissue tumors is often impaired by large dead space and fluid collection, potentially resulting in seroma formation and infection. Aim of the study is to compare negative pressure wound therapy to standard wound dressing in terms of quantity of drainage fluid and wound healing complications.
