Phase 1 Study of BCD-245 in Subjects With Neuroblastoma
The aim of the study is to investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and immunogenicity of BCD-245 after its single and multiple intravenous infusions at escalating doses in subjects with relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma.

The study includes 2 stages: 1) Data collection and safety analysis for the first four subjects 12 years of age and older from Cohort 1 2) Data collection and analysis of safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and immunogenicity in all cohorts (Cohorts 1-4).

The design of this Phase I study is based on standard 3 + 3 design approaches. Cohort 1 includes 4 subjects aged 12 years old and older, and 2 subjects aged 3 years old and older. Cohorts 2-4 include 3-6 subjects aged 3 years and older.
