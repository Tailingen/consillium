A Study Evaluating HC-1119 Single-Dose Pharmacokinetics and Effect of Food on Its Pharmacokinetics
This is a phase I study evaluating HC-1119 single-dose pharmacokinetics and effect of food on its pharmacokinetics in healthy Chinese adults. The study primary objective is to evaluate the HC-1119 pharmacokinetic characteristics and the effect of food on its pharmacokinetics in healthy Chinese males, subsequent to a single oral administration of HC-1119 with different doses in healthy Chinese males.
