Chemotherapy-Induced Changes to Cognition and DNA in Breast Cancer Survivors
The purpose of this study is to learn more about how chemotherapy affects an individual's thinking abilities (cognition). Some research has shown that chemotherapy can cause changes in cognition in breast cancer survivors. However, it is not clear why this change occurs. In this study, the investigators will look to see if damage to DNA is related to these changes in cognition. Specifically, the investigators want to see 1) if women who have been treated with chemotherapy have more DNA damage than healthy women; and 2) if DNA damage is related to cognitive problems in breast cancer survivors and healthy women.

The primary goal of this preliminary study is to examine the relationship between DNA damage and chemotherapy-induced cognitive changes in breast cancer survivors., 2 years
The primary objective of this proposal is to obtain preliminary data regarding the association between DNA damage and cognitive functioning in breast cancer survivors. Specifically, we predict that:

1. Breast cancer survivors treated with chemotherapy and hormonal therapy will have higher levels of DNA damage as measured by the Comet assay as compared to age and education matched survivors treated with hormonal therapy only and healthy controls.
2. Survivors who meet criteria for cognitive impairment will have higher levels of DNA damage as compared to cancer survivors who do not meet criteria for cognitive impairment and healthy controls.
