Value of FLT PET/CT in Radium-223 Therapy of mCRPC Patients
The aim of the study is to investigate whether positron emission tomography (PET) using the tracer 18F-Fluorothymidine (FLT) can provide information on proliferative activity in bone marrow of patients receiving Radium 223 therapy and potentially be a predictive marker of hematological toxicity
Metastatic Prostate Carcinoma
OTHER: FLT PET/CT
Uptake of FLT in hematological bone marrow, 3 months
Occurrence of hematological toxicity, 12 months
