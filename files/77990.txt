Prospective Phase II Study for Treatment Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma, CHOP-14 Plus PEG-Filgrastim Followed by Alemtuzumab Consolidation
Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Alemtuzumab
Feasibility of alemtuzumab consolidation after CHO(E)P 14 induction chemotherapy, A descriptive approach for the primary endpoint was chosen: Adherence to schedule of alemtuzumab consolidation (number of cycles, dosing, time) - comparison of planned vs given in pts receiving alemtuzumab, average of 24 weeks (treatment duration)
rate of complete remissions, at week 24 after initiation|Overall survival, 5 years
Peripheral T cell lymphoma patients of all subtypes according to WHO are treated with an induction of 6 cycles of CHOP-etoposide-14 (if below 60 years of age) oder CHOP-14. If at least a PR is reached, consolidation with alemtuzumab, total dose 133 mg, is given i.v.
