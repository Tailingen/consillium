Occurrence of Radiation-induced Otitis Media in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Patients After Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy
This is an observational cohort study to investigate the incidence of radiation-induced otitis media, changes in tubal function and hearing in newly diagnosed nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients without metastasis at multiple time points from baseline to 1 year after radiotherapy.
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
Incidence of radiation-induced otitis media, Incidence of radiation-induced otitis media will be assessed prospectively before treatment and serially up to 1 year after radiotherapy by magnetic resonance imaging, otoscope, acoustic immittance test and pure tone audiometry., 1 year
Effect of the irradiation dose of eustachian tube, tympanum, cochlea, internal auditory tract and vestibule on the occurrence of radiation-induced otitis media, The occurrence of radiation-induced otitis media will be assessed prospectively before treatment and serially up to 1 year after radiotherapy by magnetic resonance imaging, otoscope, acoustic immittance test and pure tone audiometry., 1 year|Effect of irradiation dose in the area around of eustachian tube on the severity of ototoxicity after radiotherapy, Severity of ototoxictiy will be assessed prospectively before treatment and serially up to 1 year after radiotherapy by magnetic resonance imaging, otoscope, acoustic immittance test, pure tone audiometry and the Eustachian Tube Dysfunction Questionnaire (ETDQ-7)., 1 year|Effect of irradiation dose of eustachian tube on hearing injury, The injury of hearing will be assessed prospectively before treatment and serially up to 1 year after radiotherapy by acoustic immittance test and pure tone audiometry., 1 year|Effect of different chemoradiotherapy treatment regimens on the occurrence of radiation-induced otitis media, The occurrence of radiation-induced otitis media will be assessed prospectively before treatment and serially up to 1 year after radiotherapy by magnetic resonance imaging, otoscope, acoustic immittance test and pure tone audiometry., 1 year|Correlation between radiation-induced otitis media and life quality after radiotherapy, The life quality will be assessed prospectively before treatment and serially up to 1 year after radiotherapy., 1 year
Patients with newly diagnosed non-metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (AJCC 8th) will be recruited. The incidence of radiation-induced otitis media, eustachian tube function and hearing level in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients will be prospectively evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging, otoscope, pure tone audiometry, acoustic immittance test and the Eustachian Tube Dysfunction Questionnaire (ETDQ-7) before treatment and serially up to 1 year after radiotherapy. The quality of life of patients will be evaluated before treatment and serially up to 1 year after radiotherapy. The incidence of radiation-induced otitis media, the changes of eustachian tube function and hearing level, together with the influencing factors, in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients after induction chemotherapy and concurrent chemoradiotherapy will be investigated.
