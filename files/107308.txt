Allogeneic Natural Killer (NK) Cells for Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, Peritoneal and Metastatic Breast Cancer
This is a single center phase II trial designed to optimize a clinical platform of lymphodepleting chemotherapy and T-cell suppression to promote the persistence, function, and expansion of allogeneic natural killer (NK) cells in patients with recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube, primary peritoneal cancer and advanced metastatic breast cancer.

Response Rate, Response includes Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), and Stable Disease (SD) as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v.1.1) for target lesions and assessed by CT or MRI. Complete Response (CR), disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD), neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for Progressive Disease., Month 3

The donor NK cells are infused on day 0, after a non-myeloablative preparative regimen of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine plus a cyclosporine A (CsA) based immunosuppressive therapy. Subcutaneous interleukin-2 (IL-2) is started the evening of the NK infusion and continued three times a week for 6 doses total.

Up to 4 sequential immunosuppressive platforms will be tested (Arms 1 and 2 are currently closed) to identify a platform where patients have the potential for successful NK cell expansion (defined as an absolute circulating donor derived NK cell count of \> 100 cells/Î¼l 14 days after NK cell infusion). Once a clinical platform is determined, the platform will be expanded to a total of 18 patients. The primary goal of this extended phase is to obtain preliminary efficacy information.

Follow-up for disease response is for 1 year from the NK cell infusion, with the possibility of re-treatment for patients who experience at least a clinical benefit who progress after 6 months.
