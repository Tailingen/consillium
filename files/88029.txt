Tolerability, Safety and Pharmacokinetics Study of GX-30 in Total Thyroidectomy or Near Total Thyroidectomy Patients
This study is designed as a combination of phase 1 (Part A) and phase 2 (Part B). The purpose of Part A was to determine the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics in patients with total thyroidectomy or near total thyroidectomy of GX-30 and it has been completed. The Part B is currently recruiting and will investigate the efficacy and safety of GX-30 compared with THYROGEN®.

Recombinant human TSH was developed to provide TSH stimulation without withdrawal of thyroid hormone. Radioiodine ablation and diagnosis with rhTSH became the standard of care treatment for patients with differentiated thyroid cancer. Stably supplying rhTSH has been the unmet need for management and follow-up procedure for thyroid remnant. GX-30 is an investigational product, developed to provide inexpensive rhTSH to patients in order to ensure stable supply of rhTSH.
