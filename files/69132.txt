A Study of NK012 in Patients With Relapsed Small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine whether NK012 is safe and effective in the treatment of relapsed small cell lung cancer.
Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: NK012
To evaluate the overall antitumor activity (overall response rate) of NK012, At baseline and after every 2 cycles; PR or CR must be confirmed no less than 4 weeks after the first response was recorded
Progression-free survival, Monthly for 6 months after patient goes off study, then every 3 months thereafter|Duration of response, Monthly for 6 months after patient goes off study, then every 3 months thereafter|Overall survival, Monthly for 6 months after patient goes off study, then every 3 months thereafter|Toxicity profile of NK012, Duration of study and up to 30 days after off-study
This is a Phase II, open label, single arm, multicenter study of NK012 in patients with sensitive relapsed SCLC (at least 90 days since first line therapy) or refractory relapsed SCLC (\< 90 days since first line therapy). NK012 will be administered by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes once every 28 days (on Day 1 of each cycle). Patients will be screened for UGT1A1 polymorphism prior to enrollment.
