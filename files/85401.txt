ASTRAL- a Clinical Study to Assess the Efficacy and Toxicity of High-dose Chemotherapy
A prospective Phase II clinical study to assess the efficacy and toxicity of high dose chemotherapy (HDT) followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo- or autoSCT) as treatment of primary progressive and relapsed aggressive Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) - ASTRAL
Aggressive Non-hodgkin Lymphoma (aNHL)|Lymphoma, B-Cell|Lymphoma, T-Cell
DRUG: High dose chemotherapy before allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT)|PROCEDURE: Bone marrow histology|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: clinical and laboratory parameters|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: PET-CT or CT
Measurement of efficacy variables, Rate of Progression free survival (PFS), To compare a defined high dose therapy (HDT) with study medication followed by alloSCT lead to treatment results in terms of PFS, that are better than results obtained with high-dose therapy and autoSCT in a comparable Patient Population ( historical data)., 1 year after SCT
Measurement of efficacy variables, Rate of complete remissions (CR), Number of complete remissions divided by the number of patients (CR),, 1 year after stem cell transplantation (SCT)|Measurement of efficacy variables, Rate of partial remissions (PR), Number of partial remissions divided by the number of patients (PR);, 1 year after SCT|Measurement of efficacy variables, Rate of complete and partial remissions (ORR), Number of complete and partial remissions divided by the number of patients (ORR);, 1 year after SCT|Measurement of efficacy variables, Rate of progressive diseases (PD), Number of progressive diseases after SCT divided by the number of patients (PD);, 1 year after SCT|Measurement of efficacy variables, Rate of relapse (RR), safety item, 1 year after SCT|Measurement of efficacy variables, Rate of treatment-related mortality, treatment-related death divided by the number of patients, 1 year after SCT|Rate of event free survival at 1 year (EFS), safety item, 1 year after SCT|Measurement of efficacy variables, Rate of overall survival at 1 year (OS), safety item, 1 year after SCT|Measurement of efficacy variables, Rate of non-relapse mortality (NRM), safety item, 1year after SCT|Measurement of efficacy variables, Causes of death, safety item, 1year after SCT|Measurement of efficacy variables, Incidence and severity of acute and chronic graft versus host disease (GvHD);, safety item, until the last Follow-Up Visit ( 1-2 Year after SCT)|Measurement of efficacy variables, Adverse events (AEs) grade 3 and 4, safety item, until about day 100 after SCT.|Measurement of efficacy variables, Serious adverse events (SAEs), safety item, until about day 100 after SCT.|Measurement of number of blood cells, recovery of White blood cells and platelets, 1year after SCT|Measurement of efficacy variables, Rate of infections, safety item, 1year after SCT
This is a clinical study to assess the treatment (efficacy and toxicity) with a high dosed chemotherapy followed by stem cell transplantation in patients suffering from primary progressive and relapsed aggressive Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL)

After end of the active study phase, patients will receive further standard medical care at the discretion of the treating physician. The clinical consultants will provide advice on further treatment if requested.
