Dexmedetomidine or Dexmedetomidine Combined With Dexamethasone on Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting in Breast Cancer
Previous reports demonstrated that dexmedetomidine could reduce the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Dexamethason also had been commonly used for ajuvant drugs for preventing and reducing PONV. So investigator want to study about the effect of dexmedetomidine only or combined with dexamethasone for preventing PONV.
Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting

Postoperative Nausea (Numeric Rating Scale for Nausea), Numeric rating scale for postoperative nausea (scores on a scale) (0-no symptoms; 10-worst symptoms imaginable). Ramosetron 0.3 mg was administered to patients with nausea \>5 points on the numeric rating scale, Changes from baseline in postoperative nausea at 30 min

Previous reports demonstrated that dexmedetomidine, a alpha 2 selective agonist could reduce the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Dexamethason also had been commonly used for ajuvant drugs for preventing and reducing PONV. So investigator want to study about the effect of dexmedetomidine only or combined with dexamethasone for preventing PONV.
