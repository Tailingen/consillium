Immunotherapy Combined With Y-90 and SBRT for Colorectal Liver Metastases
This study is evaluating the combination of Y-90 radioembolization followed by SBRT with the immunotherapy drugs, durvalumab and tremelimumab, to improve disease control of liver metastases for patients with microsatellite stable colorectal cancer.

DRUG: Durvalumab|DRUG: Durvalumab and Tremelimumab|DRUG: Y-90 Selective Internal Radiation Therapy (SIRT)|DRUG: Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT)
Incidence of Treatment Related Adverse Events, Adverse events related to Y-90, SBRT, and durvalumab plus tremelimumab will be summarized by dose and severity as assessed by the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0., Start of study to 3 months post treatment completion, up to 5 years|Dose-Limiting Toxicity of Y-90+SBRT in Combination with Dual Immune Checkpoint Blockade, Defined as the rate of \>Grade 3 treatment-related adverse events during treatment or within 3 months of treatment completion., Start of study to 3 months post treatment completion, up to 5 years
Duration of Response (DoR), The determination of antitumor activity will be based on objective response assessments as defined by RECIST version 1.1 and immune RECIST., Landmark time of initiation of tremelimumab, about 18 weeks after the start of treatment, to end of follow up, up to 2 years|Progression Free Survival for Three Months (PFS), The determination of antitumor activity will be based on objective response assessments as defined by RECIST version 1.1 and immune RECIST., Landmark time of initiation of tremelimumab, about 18 weeks after the start of treatment, to end of follow up, up to 2 years|Overall Response Rate (ORR), The determination of antitumor activity will be based on objective response assessments as defined by RECIST version 1.1 and immune RECIST., Landmark time of initiation of tremelimumab, about 18 weeks after the start of treatment, to end of follow up, up to 2 years|Overall Survival for Two Years (OS), Measure of overall survival rate by examining the incidence of death over a two year period., Landmark time of initiation of tremelimumab, about 18 weeks after the start of treatment, to end of follow up, up to 2 years|Liver Progression Free Survival for One Year (L-PFS), The determination of antitumor activity will be based on objective response assessments as defined by RECIST version 1.1 and immune RECIST., Landmark time of initiation of tremelimumab, about 18 weeks after the start of treatment, to end of follow up, up to 2 years|Pathological Response Rates (PRR), Measured by the percentage of viable tumor throughout and post treatment, Landmark time of initiation of tremelimumab, about 18 weeks after the start of treatment, to end of follow up, up to 2 years|Time to Tumor Progression (TTP), The determination of antitumor activity will be based on objective response assessments as defined by RECIST version 1.1 and immune RECIST., Landmark time of initiation of tremelimumab, about 18 weeks after the start of treatment, to end of follow up, up to 2 years
