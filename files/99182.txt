Nasal Endoscopic Screening and Risk Assessment for Early Gastric Cancer
Pepsinogens (PGs) can be used for gastric cancer (GC) screening, but the cutoff levels vary among studies, and PG levels are influenced by numerous factors. To examine the diagnostic value of PG levels and Helicobacter pylori (Hp) status for GC and precancerous lesions screening in asymptomatic individuals undergoing health checkup in China.

Pepsinogens (PGs) can be used for gastric cancer (GC) screening, but the cutoff levels vary among studies, and PG levels are influenced by numerous factors. To examine the diagnostic value of PG levels and Helicobacter pylori (Hp) status for GC and precancerous lesions screening in asymptomatic individuals undergoing health checkup in China. We operated a multicenter cross-sectional study of subjects who underwent health checkup at nine International Healthcare Centers in China. All participants underwent gastroscopy and pathological examination, serum PG, 13C-urea breath test, and/or Hp serological current infection marker rapid test, all on the same day. PG related parameters were analyzed in different Hp subgroups and regions.
