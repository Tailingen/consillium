A Multicenter, Prospective Study of Perioperative Finotonlimab Combined With Bevacizumab in Resectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma Patients With High-Risk Factors for Recurrence
For patients with early- to mid-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the five-year postoperative recurrence and metastasis rate remains as high as 70%, significantly impacting patient prognosis.Therefore, perioperative therapy may be considered for HCC patients with these high-risk features .

DRUG: Finotonlimab (an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody) and Anbeizhu (a bevacizumab biosimilar)|PROCEDURE: TACE
2-year DFS rate and 2-year OS rate, 2-year DFS rate refers to the proportion of patients remaining free of disease recurrence or death for over 2 years, measured from the date of surgery.

2-year OS rate refers to the proportion of subjects surviving in the trial cohort at the 2-year follow-up mark, calculated from the initiation of neoadjuvant therapy., 2years
