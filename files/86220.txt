Evaluation of the Efficacy of Xaliproden (SR57746A) in Preventing the Neurotoxicity of Oxaliplatin / 5FU/LV Chemotherapy.
Primary Objective : Compare the risk of occurrence of Grade3-4 cumulative peripheral sensory neuropathy (PSN) relative to cumulative dose of oxaliplatin between treatment group and placebo group.

Main Secondary Objective : Compare the response rate (RR) between treatment group and placebo group in order to ensure that the efficacy of the chemotherapy is not compromised by the addition of xaliproden to the chemotherapeutic regimen.

Other Secondary Objectives : study of the neurotoxicity parameters (Duration of oxaliplatin-induced PSN (G2,3,4); overall incidence of PSN during treatment; dose of onset of PSN ; incidence of dose-reduction and dose delay due to PSN; incidence of oxaliplatin treatment discontinuation due to PSN; change in Nerve Conduction Studies (NCS)) ; study of the safety profile (other than PSN) ; study of the chemotherapy efficacy (progression free survival, overall survival).
