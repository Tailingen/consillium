FOLFIRINOX in Patients With Inoperable Pancreatic Cancer
The prognosis of patients with locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer is poor, and the median survival is less than 1 year. FOLFIRINOX therapy, which induces tumor downstaging sufficient to allow surgical resection, could improve the overall survival of patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Based on the FOLFIRINOX regimen for advanced pancreatic cancer, a phase II study of this regimen in patients with locally advanced unresectable and borderline pancreatic cancer is planned to determine the rate of conversion to operability.
