Hippocampus Avoidance During Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy for T4 Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Patients
This is a prospective, non-randomized phase III study observing the cognitive function changes with conformal hippocampus avoidance during intensity modulated radiotherapy for T4 nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients.
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
the dose-volume relationship between hippocampus and cognitive function, To explore the relationship between cognitive impairment and exposure dose of hippocampus in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma., 1 year
cognitive function changes, response to the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, 1 year|memory function changes, response to the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test, 1 year|quality of life, response to the QLQ-C30, 1 year
All patients received intensity modulated radiotherapy or Tomotherapy with or without chemotherapy. Before radiotherapy, the patients will receive brain MRI scanning and the brain MRI images will be fused with the head and neck CT scan images. The investigators develop the treatment plan with hippocampus avoidance. Cognitive function are evaluated before,during and after radiotherapy. Dose-volume Histograms are got to analyze the associated factors.
