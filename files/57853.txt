Evaluating an Alternative Clinical Genetics Cancer Care Deliver Model
To evaluate an alternative clinical genetics cancer care delivery model, using non-genetic providers to introduce and order genetic testing. 250 prostate and 250 pancreatic patients will be recruiting. They will undergo genetic testing and complete study questionnaires. Results from this pilot study will be used to inform the strategies used by the Clinical Risk Evaluation Program (CREP) Genetic Counelors (CGS) and GI/GU physicians to deliver genetic testing and return genetic risk information to patients with prostate or pancreatic cancer.
