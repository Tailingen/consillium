Denosumab Plus Enzalutamide, Abiraterone and Prednisone Compared to Denosumab Plus Enzalutamide Alone for Men With Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) With Bone Metastases
This is a correlative study to characterize serum metabolites associated with bone deposition, growth and turnover in patients with newly diagnosed metastatic CRPC who are not currently receiving bone targeting agents.
