Serplulimab With Chemoradiotherapy for Postoperative Cervical Cancer With Risk Factors
A Phase II Study of Serplulimab Plus Chemoradiotherapy as Adjuvant Treatment for Postoperative Cervical Cancer with Multiple Risk Factors
Cervical Cancers
DRUG: Serplulimab|DRUG: Chemotherapy|RADIATION: radiotherapy
DFS, The time from the date of random assignment to the first occurrence of locoregional failure, DM, second primary tumor, or death from any cause., through study completion, an average of 1 year
OS, The time from random assignment to death because of any cause., through study completion, an average of 1 year|RFS, The time from random assignment to death because of any recurrence., through study completion, an average of 1 year
This study is a randomized, controlled, open-label, Phase II clinical trial designed to enroll patients with at least two risk factors (risk factors: lymph node metastasis, positive parametrial or resection margins, lymphovascular space invasion, or deep stromal invasion) following radical surgery for cervical cancer. The study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Serplulimab in combination with chemoradiotherapy compared to chemoradiotherapy alone as adjuvant treatment. Patients must be deemed suitable for cisplatin or carboplatin plus nab-paclitaxel treatment as determined by the investigator. The choice between carboplatin and cisplatin will be based on the clinical judgment of the investigator. Eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the following treatment arms: patients receiving Serplulimab plus chemoradiotherapy as adjuvant treatment (experimental group) or patients receiving chemoradiotherapy alone as adjuvant treatment (control group). The study is expected to enroll 67 patients in each group.
