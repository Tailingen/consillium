MTD Study of Vaccine BP-GMAX-CD1 Plus AP1903 to Treat Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer
This is a Phase I, non-randomized, multiple-dose, 3+3 dose-escalation study of the safety, pharmacokinetics, biomarkers, preliminary efficacy and patient-reported outcomes of therapeutic vaccine, BPX-101 (formerly BP-GMAX-CD1), plus activating agent, AP1903, in patients with castrate resistant prostate cancer.
Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC)
BIOLOGICAL: BPX-101|DRUG: AP1903
Maximum tolerated dose of BPX-101 and AP1903, To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BPX-101 and AP1903 when administered 24 hours apart, 1 Year|Safety and tolerability of BPX-101 and AP1903, To determine other measures of safety and tolerability of BPX-101 and AP1903 when administered 24 hours apart to patients with castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)., 1 Year
Pharmacokinetics of AP1903, To determine the pharmacokinetics of AP1903 when administered 24 hours after BPX-101, 1 Year|Immune responses and their association with clinical outcome, To assess immune responses and their association with clinical outcome as measured by changes in levels of interferon gamma (IFN)-producing T cells, the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response, cytokines (IFN, IL-4, IL-10), activation markers, and other markers, 2 Years|PSA response and PSA dynamics, To assess PSA response and PSA dynamics (change in velocity, doubling time), 1 Year|Number of circulating tumor cells (CTC), To assess reduction in the number of circulating tumor cells (CTC), 1 Year|Cancer-related pain, To assess cancer-related pain, 1 Year|Pain medication usage, To assess pain medication usage, 1 Year|Preliminary efficacy of BPX-101 at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), To determine preliminary efficacy of BPX-101 at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), based on tumor assessments using computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and radionuclide bone scans, 2 Years
Patients will be screened within 6 weeks prior to Week 1. A total of 3 cohorts, consisting of 3 to 6 patients each, are planned to receive five to eight intradermal (ID) injections totaling 1 mL up to 1.6mL of BPX-101 at 3 doses levels for an initial 6 doses.
