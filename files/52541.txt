Dose Finding Safety Study of VAL201 in Cancer Patients
Dose finding safety study of VAL201 in cancer patients.
Stage III Prostate Carcinoma|Stage IV Prostate Carcinoma
DRUG: VAL201
Dose-Limiting Toxicity, The number of Dose-Limiting Toxicity events is used to determine whether a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is obtained., The average timeframe is 18-26 weeks per subject
Pharmacokinetics of VAL201. (Cmax), Assessment of pharmacokinetic variables at multiple time points (5 min, 10 min, 15 min, 30 min, 60 min, 90 min, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours and 8 hours after dosing) and multiple dosing days (Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 3 Day 1, Cycle 4 Day 1 and Cycle 6 Day 1) for each patient analysed., The average timeframe is 18-26 weeks per subject|Pharmacokinetics of VAL201 (AUC 0-inf), Assessment of pharmacokinetic variables at multiple time points (5 min, 10 min, 15 min, 30 min, 60 min, 90 min, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours and 8 hours after dosing) and multiple dosing days (Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 3 Day 1, Cycle 4 Day 1 and Cycle 6 Day 1) for each patient analysed., The average timeframe is 18-26 weeks per subject
Number of Patients Who Completed 6 Cycles of Treatment, The number of patients who completed 6 cycles of treatment is compared with the number who withdrew prior to completion of the scheduled 6 cycles, The average timeframe is 18-26 weeks per subject|Number of Patients Displaying Disease Progression by PCWG2 and/or RECIST Criteria, Assessment of disease response to treatment by PCWG2 and/or RECIST. Disease progression is defined by RECIST 1.1 as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions; and by PCWG2 criteria that PSA values did not see an increase of 25% or more and absolute increase of 2 ng/mL or more from the nadir., The average timeframe is 18-26 weeks per subject
A Phase I/II, dose escalation study to assess the safety and tolerability of VAL201 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer and other advanced solid tumours.
