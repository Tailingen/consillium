Genomic and Methylation Markers in SCLC and LCNEC for Chemo-Immunotherapy Resistance Prediction (STRATUS)
The goal of this observational study is to understand how genomic and epigenetic factors contribute to resistance against chemo-immunotherapy in adults diagnosed with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) or metastatic large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC). Both ES-SCLC and LCNEC are aggressive forms of lung cancer with limited treatment options and poor prognosis. While initial responses to chemo-immunotherapy are often promising, most patients develop resistance within a few months, resulting in disease progression and limited survival. This study seeks to explore the molecular and cellular changes that drive resistance, providing insights that could guide more personalized and effective treatment strategies in the future.

The study focuses on identifying genomic and methylation signatures, as well as analyzing circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and tumor DNA (ctDNA), to better understand the mechanisms of resistance. By collecting and analyzing these biomarkers over time, researchers aim to identify patterns that distinguish patients who benefit long-term from therapy from those who experience early resistance. These findings may pave the way for new diagnostic tools and therapies to predict and overcome resistance to chemo-immunotherapy.

The main questions this study seeks to answer are:

Are there specific genomic or methylation patterns that predict resistance to chemo-immunotherapy in ES-SCLC and LCNEC? How are circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and tumor DNA (ctDNA) associated with disease progression, treatment response, and survival? What molecular differences exist between patients who respond long-term and those who develop resistance early in their treatment?

Participants will:

Provide blood and tumor tissue samples before treatment to establish baseline molecular profiles.

Undergo follow-up visits every 9 weeks during treatment, where additional blood samples and imaging tests will be collected to monitor disease progression and treatment response.

Optionally provide tissue samples through re-biopsy if the disease progresses, enabling researchers to compare changes in tumor biology over time.

All blood and tissue samples will be de-identified and securely stored for genomic and epigenetic analyses. Blood samples will be examined for circulating tumor cells and tumor DNA, while tumor tissue samples will undergo in-depth genomic and methylation profiling. Researchers will use advanced molecular and bioinformatics techniques to uncover specific patterns associated with resistance, aiming to improve current treatment strategies and develop more precise therapies.

The study will analyze data from patients over three years, encompassing various stages of treatment and disease progression. By examining longitudinal samples, the study aims to capture the dynamic changes that occur in the tumor microenvironment and how these relate to treatment outcomes.

This research is particularly important because current treatment options for ES-SCLC and LCNEC are limited, and there are no established methods to predict which patients will respond to chemo-immunotherapy. Identifying biomarkers of resistance could transform clinical care, allowing oncologists to tailor treatments to individual patients' molecular profiles and improve survival outcomes.

Ultimately, the findings from this study could lead to the development of new biomarkers for resistance, improve early detection of treatment failure, and provide the foundation for novel therapies targeting resistant cancer cells. By addressing a critical gap in the understanding of resistance mechanisms, the STRATUS trial has the potential to significantly advance the field of personalized oncology.

The STRATUS Trial (Study of Tumor Characteristics and Molecular Signatures in Neuroendocrine Tumors and SCLC) is an ambitious, prospective observational study designed to explore the molecular and genomic mechanisms underlying resistance to chemo-immunotherapy in patients diagnosed with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) and metastatic large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC). These two aggressive forms of cancer represent a significant unmet clinical need, with high relapse rates and limited therapeutic options available following the development of treatment resistance.

The study seeks to uncover actionable biomarkers, characterize resistance mechanisms, and improve our understanding of tumor evolution under selective pressures from standard therapies. By leveraging cutting-edge molecular techniques, such as next-generation sequencing (NGS), DNA methylation profiling, and liquid biopsies, STRATUS aims to set the foundation for personalized cancer treatment approaches in these difficult-to-treat malignancies.

Background and Rationale The Challenge of Resistance in ES-SCLC and LCNEC Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) are both high-grade neuroendocrine tumors characterized by rapid growth, early dissemination, and a poor prognosis. Approximately two-thirds of SCLC cases are diagnosed as extensive-stage disease (ES-SCLC), where the tumor has spread beyond the hemithorax and regional lymph nodes. Similarly, LCNEC, though rare, is frequently diagnosed at metastatic stages, with limited systemic treatment options available.

Standard treatment for ES-SCLC includes platinum-based chemotherapy combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), such as atezolizumab or durvalumab. While initial response rates exceed 70%, resistance develops rapidly in most patients, leading to disease progression within months. For LCNEC, the therapeutic landscape is even more limited, with a lack of targeted therapies or predictive biomarkers guiding treatment.

Need for Molecular Insights Resistance mechanisms in these cancers are thought to involve tumor heterogeneity, clonal evolution, epigenetic modifications, and immune evasion. However, the exact processes that drive resistance remain poorly characterized. Molecular profiling offers an opportunity to identify genomic and epigenetic alterations that correlate with treatment failure, allowing for the development of predictive biomarkers and targeted therapeutic strategies.

Role of Liquid Biopsies Liquid biopsies, including the analysis of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), have emerged as powerful tools for non-invasive tumor monitoring. These biomarkers provide real-time insights into tumor dynamics, enabling the detection of resistance mechanisms, clonal evolution, and molecular relapse.

Study Objectives Primary Objective To identify and characterize genomic, epigenetic, and methylation signatures associated with resistance to chemo-immunotherapy in ES-SCLC and LCNEC patients.

Secondary Objectives To evaluate the relationship between circulating biomarkers (CTCs, ctDNA) and clinical outcomes, including progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).

To compare molecular profiles between long-term responders and patients who develop early resistance.

To assess tumor-immune interactions and their role in resistance mechanisms, focusing on PD-L1 expression, T-cell exhaustion, and cytokine signaling pathways.

Exploratory Objectives To investigate clonal evolution and emergent subpopulations associated with resistance using phylogenetic analyses.

To explore spatial transcriptomic patterns within the tumor microenvironment. To evaluate the potential of novel biomarkers for guiding treatment decisions and monitoring disease progression.
