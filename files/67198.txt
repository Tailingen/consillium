Lapatinib in Combination With Capecitabine in Japanese Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer
This study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lapatinib taken together with capecitabine in Japanese patients. The study will proceed in two phases; the first phase(Part1) will lead to an evaluation of the mainly tolerability as well as PK parameters. If there are no major safety concerns in Part 1, the study will move into the second phase (Part 2) to further evaluate the safety and clinical activity.

Clinical Benefit Response (Independent Reviewer-assessed), CBR is defined as the percentage of participants receiving at least one dose of study medication who achieved a best overall response classified as a complete or partial (confirmed) tumor response or stable disease for at least 6 months (24 weeks). A "complete response" is defined as the disappearance of all target or non-target lesions, "partial response" and "disease progression" as at least a 30% decrease and at least a 20% increase, respectively, in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, and "stable disease" as neither "partial response" nor "disease progression.", Baseline, every 6 weeks until Week 24 and then every 12 weeks until disease progression (up to Week 119)
Time to Progression (Independent Reviewer-assessed), Time to progression is defined as the interval between the start of treatment and the earliest date of disease progression or death due to breast cancer, if sooner. Time to progression was calculated by using the Kaplan Meier estimate., Baseline, every 6 weeks until Week 24 and then every 12 weeks until disease progression or death due to breast cancer (up to Week 119)|Progression-free Survival (PFS) (Independent Reviewer-assessed), PFS is defined as the interval between the start of treatment and the earliest date of disease progression or death of any cause, if sooner., Baseline, every 6 weeks until Week 24 and then every 12 weeks until disease progression or death (up to Week 119)|6-Month Progression-free Survival (Independent Reviewer-assessed), 6-Month progression-free survival is defined as the percentage of participants surviving without progressive disease at 6 months (24 weeks) after the start of treatment. Progressive disease is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions., Baseline and then every 6 weeks until Month 6 (Week 24)|Objective Response (Independent Reviewer-assessed), Objective response is defined as the percentage of participants achieving a best overall response classified as a complete or partial (confirmed) tumor response. Complete response is defined as the disappearance of all target or non-target lesions, and partial response is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions., Baseline every 6 weeks until Week 24 and then every 12 weeks until disease progression or death (up to Week 119)|Overall Survival (Independent Reviewer-assessed), Overall survival is defined as the time from the start of treatment until death regardless of cause.

After treatment termination, followed every 12 weeks until death (up to Week 157.9)|Time to Response (Independent Reviewer-assessed), Time to response is defined as the time from the start of treatment until the first documented evidence of complete response or partial response., Baseline, every 6 weeks until Week 24 and then every 12 weeks until disease progression or death (up to Week 119)|Duration of Response (Independent Reviewer-assessed), For the subset of participants who showed a complete or partial response, duration of response is defined as the time from the first documented evidence of partial or complete tumor response until the first documented sign of disease progression or death due to breast cancer, if sooner., Baseline, every 6 weeks until Week 24 and then every 12 weeks until disease progression or death (up to Week 119)|Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of Lapatinib, Pharmacokinetic (PK) samples were collected at pre-dose, and at 1, 2, 3, 4 (plus or minus 15 minutes), 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 hours (hr) (plus or minus 30 minutes) after dosing.
