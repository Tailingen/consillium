Efficacy of Activated Lymphocytes in Renal Cell Carcinoma.
Renal cell carcinoma represents today 3% of the solid tumors of the adult. Their bad prognosis is due to the frequency of metastasis and the resistance to chemotherapy. Immunotherapy (interferon-α, interleukin-2) has shown some good results but an important toxicity. In our study, we evaluate the response to a new therapeutic strategy which combines an injection of patient's own activated lymphocytes to a classic immunotherapy with interferon-α and interleukin-2.
Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: activated lymphocytes
Objective response rate: partial or complete response during at least 4 weeks from week 22 after the beginning of the first cycle of cytokines.
- Disease free survival|- Overall survival|- Functional and phenotypic characteristics of injected cells|- Biological response
Phase I and II trials for the treatment of melanoma or renal cell carcinoma have already evaluated lymphokine-activated killer cells and tumor-infiltrating cells. In metastatic renal cell carcinoma, these therapies have shown some complete responses and a low toxicity. In our study, we evaluate the response to a new therapeutic strategy which combines an injection of patient's own activated lymphocytes to a classic immunotherapy with interferon-α and interleukin-2. A secondary objective is to improve cell preparation methods and to characterize functionally and phenotypically injected cells.
