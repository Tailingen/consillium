Neuroblastoma
DRUG: Naxitamab monotherapy|DRUG: GM-CSF|DRUG: Irinotecan|DRUG: Temozolomide|DRUG: Naxitamab in combination therapy|DRUG: GM-CSF with combination regimen|DRUG: Sintilimab
ORR, The proportion of patients who achieved CR or PR, from start of naxitamab treatment to 1.5 years after EOT
DCR, The proportion of patients who achieved CR or PR or SD, from start of naxitamab treatment to 1.5 years after EOT|EFS, The time from from start of naxitamab treatment to disease progression, recurrence, from start of naxitamab treatment to 1.5 years after EOT|OS, The time from from start of naxitamab treatment to death or loss of follow-up, from start of naxitamab treatment to 1.5 years after EOT
Patients with high risk neuroblastoma who obtain CR after chemotherapy combined with surgery, radiotherapy and/or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation received axitamab and GM-CSF. Patients with high-risk neuroblastoma treated by chemotherapy combined with surgery, radiotherapy and or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation patients with tumor residual or progression during treatment (refractory) received naxitamab and GM-CSF in combination with irinotecan and temozolomide or naxitamab and GM-CSF in combination with irinotecan and temozolomide and PD-1 antibody.
