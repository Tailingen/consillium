Study of GDX012 in Patients With MRD Positive AML
The purpose of this first-in-human study is to assess the safety, tolerability, antileukemic activity and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of GDX012 in AML patients who are MRD positive by multiparametric flow cytometry.

The study will consist of a dose escalation stage to evaluate various doses of GDX012 after a lymphodepletion regimen comprising fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. Following determination of the MTD of GDX012, the study will expand at the MTD. Patients will be followed up for 12 months, after receiving GDX012.
