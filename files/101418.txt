A Phase I Safety and Pharmacokinetic Study of Gamitrinib Administered Intravenously to Patients With Advanced Cancer
This is a first-in-human, phase I, open-label, non-randomized dose-escalation and dose-expansion study with the primary objective to determine the safety profile of small molecule, mitochondrial-targeted Hsp90 inhibitor, gamitrinib, including identification of dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in patients with advanced cancers. A secondary objective of the study is to determine the recommended dose and regimen(s) for a phase II study. This study is based on preclinical data demonstrating the anticancer activity, unique mechanism of action and preliminary safety of gamitrinib.

In the dose-finding portion of this study, gamitrinib formulated in Lipoid S100®-based formulation will be administered as a 1-hour IV infusion once weekly for four weeks as 28-day treatment cycles. Up to 36 patients will be enrolled in the dose-escalation component of the study based on anticipated cohorts. The starting dose will be 10 mg, corresponding to allometric scaling) from the most sensitive species (rats) in the 29-day GLP toxicology and toxicokinetic studies with 14-day recovery period of gamitrinib. Dose-escalation will follow a 3+3 design. Six patients will be enrolled in the dose-expansion component of the study at MTD for the purpose of exploring pharmacodynamic effects via tumor pre and on-therapy biopsies.

Determine the MTD and/or RP2D of gamitrinib when administered once weekly., First cycle dose-limiting toxicities. The maximally tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the dose level below which the absolute observed DLT rate is \> 25%. The MTD is equivalent to the anticipated recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D)., 7 years
