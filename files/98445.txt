A Study to Investigate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics (PK), and Preliminary Anticancer Activity of GSK4524101 Alone or With Niraparib in Participants With Solid Tumors
The primary purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of GSK4524101 monotherapy (MTD) and GSK4524101 in combination with niraparib (MTDc). The study consists of two parts - Part 1 (Dose Escalation) and Part 2 (Dose Expansion).
