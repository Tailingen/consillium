Optimizing Pembrolizumab Therapy With Timing and Intensification With Axitinib
The purpose of this research is to test the response of study participants' tumor to pembrolizumab alone, and in combination with axitinib, and to see what effects (good and bad) these drugs have on patients with advanced kidney cancer.
Renal Cell Cancer
DRUG: Axitinib|DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Proportion of Patient Response, To catalogue the number and proportion of patients with persistence of complete response or optimal partial response at 1 year after the discontinuation of pembrolizumab, 2 year|Objective Response Rate After Axitinib, To assess the objective response rate after addition of axitinib in patients with a suboptimal partial response, stable disease or progressive disease on pembrolizumab monotherapy alone., 2 year
Objective Response Rate after Pembrolizumab, To determine the objective response rate (ORR: CR +oPR + sPR) after 6 cycles of primary treatment with pembrolizumab, 2 year|Duration of Response, To determine duration of CR or oPR

To determine progression-free survival (PFS) from pembrolizumab initiation

To determine treatment-free survival (TFS) from pembrolizumab discontinuation

To assess safety and toxicity according to NCI CTCAE v5, 2 year|Overall Survival, To determine overall survival (OS) from pembrolizumab initiation, 2 year|Proportion of patients that experience toxicity, To assess safety and toxicity according to NCI CTCAE v5 on pembrolizumab monotherapy, 2 year
Patients will receive infusions of pembrolizumab. After an MRI or CT scan to determine how the tumor is responding to the drug, the patient will either continue receiving infusions of pembrolizumab alone, or receive axitinib in addition to pembrolizumab. The patient will also need to provide a biopsy of your tumor around the time the imaging scan is taken and need to come to the clinic around every three weeks during treatment. At the clinic visits, we will also do lab tests and imaging.
