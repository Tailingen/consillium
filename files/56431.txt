MRI Scans in Evaluating the Effects of Radiation Therapy and Chemotherapy in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme or Anaplastic Glioma
RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as MRI, may help in learning how well radiation therapy and chemotherapy work in killing tumor cells and allow doctors to plan better treatment.

PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying MRI scans to see how well they evaluate the effects of radiation therapy and chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic glioma.

Relative Cerebral Blood Volume as Measured by Perfusion-weighted MRI Before, During, and After Chemoradiotherapy, Relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) is the blood volume in the region of interest (ROI) divided by the blood volume in the symmetrical region on the other side of the normal brain (control region). CBV was assessed using spin-echo post-contrast T1-weighted images. Multiple images were used to assess each participant at every time-point and the median value for each participant was calculated by time-point. The data presented represent the average of those median values at each time-point. The baseline value was measured twice (representing baseline 1 and 2) to make sure that the value was reproducible and to account for any variation attributable to measurement variation.

CBF was assessed using spin-echo post-contrast T1-weighted images. CBF was assessed using spin-echo post-contrast T1-weighted images.

The data presented represent the average of those median values at each time-point.

Ktrans reflects the efflux rate of contrast from blood plasma into the tissue extravascular extracellular space (EES). Ktrans was assessed using post-contrast T1-weighted images. Multiple images were used to assess each participant at every time-point and the median value for each participant was calculated by time-point. The data presented represent the average of those median values at each time-point.

ADC was assessed using post-contrast T1-weighted images. Multiple images were used to assess each participant at every time-point and the median value for each participant was calculated by time-point. The data presented represent the average of those median values at each time-point.

OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To quantitatively compare the relative cerebral blood volume/flow, mean transit time, and mean vessel diameter as measured by perfusion-weighted MRI before, during, and after chemoradiotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.
* To measure the permeability-surface area product on a voxel-by-voxel basis before, during, and after chemoradiotherapy in these patients.
* To measure the full water self-diffusion tensor on a voxel-by-voxel basis before, during, and after chemoradiotherapy in these patients.
* To compare the tensor fractional anisotropy before, during, and after chemoradiotherapy in these patients.
* To compare the relative regional concentrations of choline, N-acetyl-asparate, and myoinositol as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy before, during, and after chemoradiotherapy to interrogate cell membrane turnover, neuronal integrity, and glial reactions.
* To test the affects of a short period of 100% oxygen inhalation on imaging of tumor and surrounding tissue regions of interest, specifically cerebral blood volume changes in each area as compared to room air.

Secondary

* To collect blood and urine samples for correlation analysis between imaging changes, molecular markers (including genetic markers), and clinical outcome of glioblastoma multiforme (phenotypic information).
* To correlate blood and urine biomarkers and blood genetic markers with tumor expression of these markers.

OUTLINE: Patients undergo radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for 6 weeks. Patients also receive oral temozolomide once daily 7 days a week during radiotherapy. After completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients receive oral temozolomide once daily for 5 days. Treatment with temozolomide repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients undergo MRI, including perfusion- and diffusion-weighted MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy prior to initiation of chemoradiotherapy, once weekly during chemoradiotherapy, and then monthly until tumor progression or until completion of 6 courses of post chemoradiotherapy.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed annually.
