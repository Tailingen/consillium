A Study of Nemtabrutinib (MK-1026) Versus Comparator (Investigator's Choice of Ibrutinib or Acalabrutinib) in First Line (1L) Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)/ Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL) (MK-1026-011/BELLWAVE-011)
The goal of this study is to evaluate nemtabrutinib compared with investigator's choice of ibrutinib or acalabrutinib in participants with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) who have not received any prior therapy. The primary hypotheses are that (1) nemtabrutinib is non-inferior to ibrutinib or acalabrutinib with respect to objective response rate (ORR) per International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (iwCLL) Criteria 2018 by blinded independent central review (BICR) and (2) nemtabrutinib is superior to ibrutinib or acalabrutinib with respect to progression free survival (PFS) per iwCLL Criteria 2018 by BICR.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma
DRUG: Nemtabrutinib|DRUG: Ibrutinib|DRUG: Acalabrutinib
Objective Response Rate (ORR) per Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (iwCLL) Criteria 2018 as assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with complete response (CR), complete response with an incomplete recovery of the participant's bone marrow (CRi), nodular partial response (nPR), or partial response (PR), per iwCLL Criteria 2018 as assessed by BICR., Up to ~33 months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) per iwCLL Criteria 2018 as assessed by BICR, PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. PD is evaluated per iwCLL Criteria 2018 as assessed by BICR., Up to ~104 months
Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause., Up to ~104 months|Duration of Response (DOR) per iwCLL Criteria 2018 as assessed by BICR, For participants who demonstrate a complete response (CR), complete response with an incomplete recovery of the participant's bone marrow (CRi), nodular partial response (nPR), or partial response (PR) per iwCLL Criteria 2018 as assessed by BICR, DOR is defined as the time from the first documented evidence of CR, CRi, nPR, or PR that led to response until disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to ~104 months|Number of Participants Who Experience One or More Adverse Events (AEs), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention., Up to ~104 months|Number of Participants Who Discontinue Study Treatment Due to an AE, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention., Up to ~104 months
