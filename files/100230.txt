This is a study for the Long Term Follow Up for all participants treated with Verismo Therapeutics' SynKIR CAR T cell products in accordance with regulatory guidance. The primary objective of this study is to monitor the long-term safety of SynKIR CAR T cell products.

No investigational product will be administered in this LTFU study. Eligible participants must have received at least 1 infusion of a SynKIR CAR T cell product under a Verismo Therapeutics parent protocol. Participants will be invited to enroll into this LTFU study after either early discontinuation from or completion of the parent protocol.

In accordance with regulatory guidelines, this study will follow participants for a period of 15 years following infusion of Verismo Therapeutics' SynKIR CAR T cell product, to monitor for delayed adverse events (AEs), detection of replication competent lentivirus (RCL), and to assess long-term efficacy and persistence of gene-modified T cells.
