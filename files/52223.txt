A Longitudinal Multi-Omic Biomarker Profiling Study of Patients With Head & Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC)
The study is a prospective, longitudinal, non-interventional, multicenter study of participants with HNSCC who will have tissue and blood based molecular biomarker profiling during their standard of care treatment.
Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
Explore DNA, RNA, immune and other multiomic biomarkers to better understand prognostic or predictive biomarkers and to inform future research for new relevant biomarkers., Use NGS, ctNDA assessments, RNA analysis, and other multiomic testing to uncover biomarkers of collected blood and tissue samples that may predict outcomes, identify markers related to disease, identify markers related to mechanism of drug action, and inform future research., 5 years
Explore changes in relevant DNA, RNA, immune and multiomic biomarkers in longitudinal blood samples, and diagnostic and progression biopsy samples, to understand real-world outcomes and resistance mechanisms., Correlate biomarkers of collected blood and tissue samples with standard of care therapy real-world outcomes such as overall survival, progression free survival, time to next treatment, and time to treatment discontinuation., 5 years|Explore changes in ctDNA from longitudinal blood samples to assess ctDNA as a response biomarker., Assess changes in ctNDA of collected blood samples using ctDNA clearance factors such as time to clearance, best overall clearance rate, best confirmed clearance, duration, time to ctDNA recurrence with standard of care therapy real-world outcomes such as overall survival, progression free survival, time to next treatment, and time to treatment discontinuation., 5 years
