Impact of Music Therapy on Anxiety in Patients With Cancer Undergoing Simulation for Radiation Therapy
This study looks at the effects of a protocolized music therapy intervention on state anxiety for patients with cancer undergoing simulation for radiation therapy. Simulation, which is an imaging and diagnostic procedure, has been identified as producing significantly high levels of anxiety in many cancer patients.
Anxiety and Distress
OTHER: music therapy
Reduction in state anxiety, pt received a protocolized music therapy intervention that included altered state induction, music driven guided visualiztion, and psychoeducation on relaxation techniques to be used during simulation for radiation therapy. Prescribed pre-recorded music program provided to be used during simulation., 20 minutes
