A Study to Evaluate Corrected QT Interval and Drug-Drug Interaction of Trastuzumab on Carboplatin in the Presence of Docetaxel in Patients With HER2-Positive Metastatic or Locally Advanced Inoperable Cancer
This Phase Ib, multicenter, single-arm, open-label study is designed to evaluate the effect of trastuzumab on QTcF interval and to characterize the effects of trastuzumab on carboplatin pharmacokinetics in patients with HER2-positive metastatic or locally advanced inoperable cancer.

The QT interval is a measure of time between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave in the heart's electrical cycle. The QTcF interval is the QT interval as calculated using Fridericia's correction; the QTcB interval is the QT interval as calculated using Bazett's correction.

Change From Baseline in Corrected QT Interval Using Fridericia's Correction (QTcF) at Trastuzumab Steady State, Triplicate 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements (each recording separated by approximately 2 minutes) were performed and average was calculated. The time corresponding to beginning of depolarization to repolarization of the ventricles (QT interval) was adjusted for RR interval using QT and RR from each ECG by Fridericia's formula (QTcF = QT divided by cube root of RR). Trastuzumab steady state was defined as the average of the 2 ECG measurements collected on Cycle 1 Day 8 (C1D8) and Cycle 2 Day 1 (C2D1) after the trastuzumab infusion., Baseline, Cycle 1 Day 8 and Cycle 2 Day 1|Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of Carboplatin, 0 to 5 minutes after end of infusion on Cycle 1 Day 1 (in absence of trastuzumab) and Cycle 2 Day 1 (in presence of trastuzumab)|Area Under the Curve From Time Zero to 6 Hours Post Infusion (AUC0-6hr) of Carboplatin, AUC0-6hr = Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from 0 to 6 hours post-infusion., 0 to 5, 60 (±5), 120 (±10), 240 (±10), and 360 (±15) minutes after end of infusion on Cycle 1 Day 1 (in absence of trastuzumab) and Cycle 2 Day 1 (in presence of trastuzumab)|Dose-Normalized Cmax (Cmax/D) of Carboplatin, Dose normalized Cmax is the maximum observed concentration of carboplatin in plasma normalized for different dose levels., 0 to 5 minutes after end of infusion on Cycle 1 Day 1 (in absence of trastuzumab) and Cycle 2 Day 1 (in presence of trastuzumab)|Geometric Mean Ratio of Cmax/D of Carboplatin, The geometric mean ratio of Cmax of carboplatin was defined as the Cmax/D of carboplatin on Cycle 1 Day 1 (in the absence of trastuzumab) divided by Cmax/D of carboplatin on Cycle 2 Day 1 (in the presence of trastuzumab)., 0 to 5 minutes after end of infusion on Cycle 1 Day 1 (in absence of trastuzumab) and Cycle 2 Day 1 (in presence of trastuzumab)|Dose-Normalized AUC0-6hr (AUC0-6hr/D) of Carboplatin, AUC0-6hr/D = Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from 0 to 6 hours post-infusion, normalized by carboplatin dose level., 0 to 5, 60 (±5), 120 (±10), 240 (±10), and 360 (±15) minutes after end of infusion on Cycle 1 Day 1 (in absence of trastuzumab) and Cycle 2 Day 1 (in presence of trastuzumab)|Geometric Mean Ratio of AUC0-6hr/D of Carboplatin, The geometric mean ratio of AUC0-6hr/D of carboplatin was defined as the AUC0-6hr/D of carboplatin on Cycle 1 Day 1 (in the absence of trastuzumab) divided by AUC0-6hr/D of carboplatin on Cycle 2 Day 1 (in the presence of trastuzumab)., 0 to 5, 60 (±5), 120 (±10), 240 (±10), and 360 (±15) minutes after end of infusion on Cycle 1 Day 1 (in absence of trastuzumab) and Cycle 2 Day 1 (in presence of trastuzumab)|Plasma Decay Half-Life (t1/2) of Carboplatin, Plasma decay half-life is the time measured for the plasma concentration to decrease by one half., 0 to 5, 60 (±5), 120 (±10), 240 (±10), and 360 (±15) minutes after end of infusion on Cycle 1 Day 1 (in absence of trastuzumab) and Cycle 2 Day 1 (in presence of trastuzumab)|Maximum Observed Serum Concentration (Cmax) of Trastuzumab, 30 (±15) minutes after the end of the infusion on Cycle 1 Day 2, Cycle 1 Day 8, Cycle 2 Day 1, and Cycle 3 Day 1|Minimum Observed Serum Trough Concentration (Cmin) of Trastuzumab, 15 (±15) minutes prior to the start of the trastuzumab infusion on Cycle 1 Day 2, Cycle 1 Day 8, Cycle 2 Day 1, and Cycle 3 Day 1
