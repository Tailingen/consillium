Clinical Study of TQB2618 Injection in Combination With Demethylation Drugs in Patients With Recurrent/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Myelodysplastic Syndromes
This project is an open, dose escalation and expansion phase I clinical study. The first phase is a dose escalation study, and the second phase is a dose expansion study based on the Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) / Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) obtained in the first phase. The purpose is to evaluate the tolerability and initially evaluate the antitumor efficacy of TQB2618 injection combined with demethylation drugs in patients with recurrent/refractory acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes.
