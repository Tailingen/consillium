Study of Canakinumab in Patients With Myelofibrosis
This is an open label, multicenter, phase 2 trial of Canakinumab in patients with primary myelofibrosis (PMF), post essential thrombocythemia/polycythemia vera related MF (Post ET/PV MF). Eligible patients will receive Canakinumab administered as a subcutaneous injection on day 1 of a 21 day cycle for a core study period of 8 cycles. Canakinumab will be given by subcutaneous injection (SC) injection at a starting dose of 200 mg (one 150 mg/mL syringe and one 50 mg/0.5 mL syringe) every 3 weeks. The interim analysis will be performed when the number of enrolled patients reaches 10. If no responses OR 4 or more patients have unacceptable toxicity, the study will not proceed to the second stage. If the total number of patients reaches the maximum sample size of 26, the treatment is deemed acceptable if the number of responses in the efficacy endpoint are greater than 3, and the number of toxicities are less than 7.

DRUG: Canakinumab
Number of participant with response based on IWG-MRT criteria, Efficacy of Canakinumab as measured by number of participant with response based on the International Working Group for Myelofibrosis Research and Treatment (IWG-MRT) criteria. A response is considered any one of the following: complete response, partial response, or clinical improvement (inclusive of anemia response, spleen response, or symptom response)., 24 weeks
Number of Adverse Events, The safety and tolerability of Canakinumab as measured by the adverse event profile of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0, 24 weeks|Response using IWG-MRT, To assess the efficacy of Canakinumab as determined by response assessment using IWG/ELN criteria. Participant's response will be categorized as negative, stable, or positive., 12 weeks|Response using IWG-MRT, To assess the efficacy of Canakinumab as determined by response assessment using IWG/ELN. Participant's response will be categorized as negative, stable, or positive., 24 weeks|Number of participants with clinical improvement, Clinical improvement (CI) is defined by IWG-MRT criteria. Participants meet CI if meet any of the following:

Anemia (Patients will meet IWG-MRT criteria for clinical improvement if their hemoglobin increase by 2g/dl from baseline and/or become transfusion independent.)

Splenomegaly (Patients will meet IWG-MRT criteria for clinical improvement if their spleen decreases by ≥30% from baseline volume.)

Disease-related symptoms (Patients will meet IWG-MRT criteria for clinical improvement if their MPN-SAF symptom score decreases by ≥50% from baseline), 12 weeks|Number of participants with clinical improvement, Clinical improvement (CI) is defined by IWG-MRT criteria.
