Clinical Study to Evaluate the Maximum Tolerated Dose of BAY1000394 Given in a 3 Days on / 4 Days Off Schedule in Subjects With Advanced Malignancies
Clinical study to determine safety, tolerability, to measure how the drug is metabolized by the body and to determine the maximum tolerated dose of BAY1000394 given in an intermittent 3 days on / 4 days off schedule to patients with advanced malignancies
Neoplasms
DRUG: Roniciclib (BAY1000394)
Safety: Frequency of adverse events, Up to 3 years or longer if indicated|Maximum tolerated dose: Measured by adverse event profile, Up to 3 years or longer if indicated|Pharmacokinetics: Plasma concentrations of BAY1000394 will be measured. The following parameters will be calculated: Cmax, tmax, AUC(0-tn), AUC, and half-life., Approximately 6 weeks
Biomarkers evaluation: analysis of apoptosis marker CK18/M30 and total soluble cytokeratin CK18/M65, Up to 3 years or longer if indicated|Assessment of expression (IHC) and amplification status (FISH) of markers related to cell proliferation and the cell cycle in Paraffin-embedded archival tumor samples. These will include, but may not be limited to Cyclin E, Cyclin D, p21, and Ki67, From archival tumor blocks|Functional testing of peripheral leucocytes, for example induction of cytokine synthesis, Approximately 6 weeks|Assessment of intracellular biomarkers of apoptosis (for example activated caspase 3, annexin V, expression of MCL 1 for patients with chronic lymphocytic leucemia only, Approximately 6 weeks|Tumor response evaluation based on RECIST 1.1 (solid tumors) or response based on the pertinent guidelines (malignant lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia) every 2 cycles, Up to 3 years or longer if indicated
