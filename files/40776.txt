A Study of Fluzoparib Given in Combination With Apatinib and Paclitaxel in Gastric Cancer Patients
Fluzoparib is an oral potent, selective PARP-1 and PARP-2 inhibitor; Apatinib is an oral selective VEGFR inhibitor. This open-label, dose finding phase I trial studies the tolerability and the best dose of Fluzoparib in combination with apatinib and paclitaxel and to see how well this three drugs work together in the treatment of patients with recurrent and metastatic gastric cancer who progress following first-line therapy. The safety and efficacy of fluzoparib in combination with apatinib and paclitaxel will be explored.
