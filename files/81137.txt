Pilot Study of Autologous Anti-CD22 Chimeric Antigen Receptor Redirected T Cells In Patients With Chemotherapy Resistant Or Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
This is a single center, single arm, open-label pilot study to determine the feasibility and safety of a single dose of autologous T cells expressing CD22 chimeric antigen receptors expressing tandem TCRζ and 4-1BB (TCRζ/4-1BB) co-stimulatory domains (referred to as "CART22" cells) administered in split fractions, in adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
Relapsed or Refractory B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: CART22 cells
