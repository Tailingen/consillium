Hypofractionated vs Standard Radiotherapy in Breast Cancer With an Indication for Regional Lymph Node Irradiation About Lymphedema Occurrence
The standard treatment of localized breast cancers consists of surgical removal of the tumor at the breast or removal of the entire breast and lymph nodes (sentinel lymph node and / or axillary dissection) with or without chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy on the breast or thoracic wall and the lymph node areas from 5 to 6.5 weeks.

Shorter radiotherapy treatments over 3 weeks for breast cancer without lymph node involvement have been equally effective and have no more side effects in several clinical trials involving several thousand patients. This called hypofractionated radiotherapy has become a standard for breast cancers in the absence of lymph node involvement in postmenopausal women.

The objective of the HypoG01 trial is to evaluate hypofractionated radiotherapy in women who require radiotherapy in the breast or chest wall and lymph node areas by comparing standard over 5 to 6.5 weeks and hypofractionated irradiation over 3 weeks analyzing the possible side effects and in particular the risk of lymphedema (swelling of the arm on the side treated) and the effectiveness of these treatments
Breast Cancer Female
RADIATION: HYPOFRACTIONATED|RADIATION: NORMOFRACTIONATED
Arm Lymphedema, Occurrence radiation-induced late morbidity measured as lymphedema of the arm on the treated side at 3 years after adjuvant radiotherapy as follows: At least≥ 10% increased arm circumference measured 15 cm proximal and/or 10 cm distal of the olecranon of the treated side relative to the baseline value, compared to the contralateral side circumference also relative to its baseline value., At 3 years
Functional Assessment, Flexion/abduction of the upper arm will be assessed., Before treatment, week 3 or week 7 of treatment according the treatment arm and boost realization, 6 months after the last fraction received, every year during 5 years, 10 years|Aesthetics Assessment-FIBROSIS, Fibrosis as tissue induration, telangiectasia, oedema of the breast/chest wall and dyspigmentation will be evaluated according the LENT-SOMA scoring scale., Before treatment, week 3 or week 7 of treatment according the treatment arm and boost realization, 6 months after the last fraction received, every year during 5 years, 10 years|Aesthetics Assessment-BIS SCORE, The patient evaluates satisfaction on The Body Image Score (BIS) where has been added an extra question regarding clothing habits and furthermore based on the study by Lyngholm et al also 2 more questions regarding the satisfaction with the appearance of the treated breast after breast conservation with and without comparison to the opposite breast as done in the DBCG HYPOII trial. In addition, it will ask if the patient treated with breast conservation has had lipo-feeling injection in the breast during follow up., Before treatment, week 3 or week 7 of treatment according the treatment arm and boost realization, 6 months after the last fraction received, every year during 5 years, 10 years|Aesthetics Assessment-Global Cosmestic, The global cosmetic result after breast conservation will be based on Harris´ 4-point scale modified by Rune Gärtner et al, Before treatment, week 3 or week 7 of treatment according the treatment arm and boost realization, 6 months after the last fraction received, every year during 5 years, 10 years|CTCAE Toxicity Assessment, Acute/ late toxicity will be assessed according to the flowchart and performed based on CTCAE V4, Before treatment, every week of treatment, week 3 or week 7 of treatment according the treatment arm and boost realization, 6 months after the last fraction received, every year during 5 years, 10 years|RTOG/EORTC Toxicity Assessment, Acute/ late toxicity will be assessed according to the flowchart and performed based on Toxicity Criteria of RTOG/EORTC, Before treatment, every week of treatment, week 3 or week 7 of treatment according the treatment arm and boost realization, 6 months after the last fraction received, every year during 5 years, 10 years|Cancer Related events, Cancer related endpoints are secondary endpoints in this trial. It's a composite outcome taking into account all relapse events (locoregional, invasive disease, distant disease), breast-cancer specific survival, and causes of death as defined per DATECAN guidelines. All time to cancer related endpoints are defined as starting from the date of randomization until the event., 6 months after the last fraction received, every year during 5 years, 10 years|Cost-Utility, A cost-utility analysis comparing radiotherapy regimens will be performed based on QALYs, Week 3 or week 7 of treatment according the treatment arm and boost realization|Quality of Life QLQ-C30, Patients' quality of life will be assessed using self-administered questionnaire EORTC QLQ-C30, Before treatment, week 3 or week 7 of treatment according the treatment arm and boost realization, 6 months after the last fraction received, every year during 5 years, 10 years|Quality of Life EORTC BR23, Patients' quality of life will be assessed using self-administered questionnaire EORTC BR23, Before treatment, week 3 or week 7 of treatment according the treatment arm and boost realization, 6 months after the last fraction received, every year during 5 years, 10 years|Quality of Life Euroqol EQ-5D5D, Patients' quality of life will be assessed using self-administered questionnaire Euroqol EQ-5D5D, Before treatment, week 3 or week 7 of treatment according the treatment arm and boost realization, 6 months after the last fraction received, every year during 5 years, 10 years
