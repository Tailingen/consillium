Effects of Healing Touch on Patients Undergoing Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant
This randomized pilot clinical trial studies healing touch or usual care in improving quality of life in patients undergoing stem cell transplant. Healing touch may improve the quality of life of patients undergoing stem cell transplant.

PROCEDURE: therapeutic touch|OTHER: quality-of-life assessment|OTHER: questionnaire administration
Length of hospital stay, Days to engraftment defined as absolute neutrophil count (ANC: segs + bands) greater, Up to 100 days|Changes in QoL (POMS-SF, FACT-BMT, CES-D), Changes in levels of QoL measures before and after hospitalization will be compared using the paired t-test or the nonparametric paired sign test, if the assumption of normality is substantially violated., Baseline up to 100 days
Number of hospital readmissions, Up to 100 days
Primary Objectives:

I. To estimate the effects of healing touch (HT) vs usual care in the following clinical outcomes of stem cell transplant (SCT) patients; length of hospital stay, days to engraftment, and number of hospital readmissions during 100 days post-transplant.

II. To estimate changes in quality of life (QoL) which occur during hospitalization of SCT patients who receive HT vs. usual care.

III. To examine differences in effects of HT vs. usual care (UC) in patients receiving related allogeneic (Allo) transplant compared to those receiving autologous (Auto) transplant.

OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

ARM I: Patients receive daily HT sessions comprising pain drain, chakra connection, magnetic clearing, and mind clearing over 30 minutes from day 1 until 2 days before discharge from the hospital.

ARM II: Patients receive routine nursing care from doctors and nurses from day 1 until 2 days before discharge from the hospital.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 100 days.
