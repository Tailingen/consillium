VISmodegib for ORbital and Periocular Basal Cell Carcinoma
Basal cell carcinoma (BCCA) is the most common human cancer, and frequently affects facial structures. While rarely fatal, facial BCCA can be disfiguring and expensive to treat.

Vismodegib is a small molecule inhibitor of SMO developed for the treatment of tumors in which the Hh signaling pathway appears to contribute to the development and maintenance of tumorigenesis. Vismodegib was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of metastatic and locally advanced BCCA. Recent reports have suggested that vismodegib treatment for orbital BCCA may facilitate eye preservation even if surgery is eventually required

In order to assess the potential of vismodegib to improve the ophthalmic outcomes following treatment for orbital and/or periocular BCCA, this study will follow patients with globe-threatening orbital and lacrimal-threatening periocular BCCA who are being treated with vismodegib as standard of care.

Patients with tumors that do not respond to treatment with Vismodegib, and those who have a good response but poor tolerance of Vismodegib, will be offered surgical excision of the tumor. Patients with a good response and good tolerance of Vismodegib may continue the treatment as long as clinically indicated.
Carcinoma, Basal Cell
DRUG: Vismodegib
The Number of Patients With a Score of 21 or Greater by the Visual Assessment Weighted Score (VAWS)., The VAWS was developed for the purpose of this study. It is made up of standard ophthalmic exam points, as well as subjective assessment of tearing and overall patient satisfaction. The maximum score is 50 and a score of 21 or greater will be considered a good outcome., Until end of study treatment (up to 15 months after start of study treatment); treatment duration ranged from 53 - 386 days.
Number of Patients With Progressive Disease (PD), Treatment response will be determined per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) protocol, using clinical measurements and/or tumor imaging measurements (determined by treating physician)., Until end of study treatment (up to 15 months after start of study treatment); treatment duration ranged from 53 - 386 days.|Number of Patients With a Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR) or Stable Disease (SD) AND Good Tolerance of Vismodegib, Tolerance will be self-reported by patient. Treatment response will be determined per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) protocol, using clinical measurements and/or tumor imaging measurements (determined by treating physician)., Until end of study treatment (up to 15 months after start of study treatment); treatment duration ranged from 53 - 386 days.|Number of Patients With a Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR) or Stable Disease (SD) AND Poor Tolerance of Vismodegib, Tolerance will be self-reported by patient.
