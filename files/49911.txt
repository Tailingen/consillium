A Study of Botensilimab (AGEN1181) for the Treatment of Advanced Melanoma
This study is an open-label, 2-part, Phase 2, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profiles of botensilimab as monotherapy and in combination with balstilimab in participants with advanced cutaneous melanoma refractory to checkpoint inhibitor therapy.

This Phase 2 study will enroll up to approximately 220 evaluable adult participants with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of either Stage III (unresectable) or Stage IV cutaneous melanoma and who have had prior treatments with anti-programmed death (ligand) 1 \[PD-(L)1\].

This study will consist of 2 parts. Part 1 consists of 2 cohorts (Cohorts A and B) that will receive botensilimab monotherapy. In Cohort A, participants refractory to PD-(L)1 will receive botensilimab. In Cohort B, participants refractory to PD-(L)1 and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) will receive botensilimab. Part 2 consists of Cohorts A and B that will receive botensilimab combination therapy. In Cohort A, participants refractory to PD-(L)1 will receive botensilimab in combination with balstilimab. In Cohort B, participants refractory to PD-(L)1 and CTLA-4 will receive botensilimab in combination with balstilimab.
