Clinical Value of the MRI Combined With SCC-Ag for the Diagnosis of HSIL (CIN 2/3)
The study aimed to identify the clinical value of Magnetic Resonance Imaging examination (MRI)combined with serum squamous cells carcinoma antigen (SCC-Ag) in women with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grades 2-3 (CIN 2-3)).

186 female patients with the HSIL(CIN2-3) were included in this study and followed up from the time of admission. All patients underwent colposcopy examination, MRI, SCC-Ag, loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP), extrafascial hysterectomy, or radical hysterectomy. Pathological findings of the patient's tissues were used as the final diagnostic criteria. On the one hand, we compared the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of MRI+SCC-Ag, LEEP of the menopausal group, and non-menopausal group. On the other hand, evaluating the accuracy of MRI combined with SCC-Ag examination in diagnosing HSIL(CIN2-3) by receiver-operating characteristic curve (ROC)ï¼Ž
