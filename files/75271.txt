A Pilot Study Using Short-Term Cultured Anti-Tumor Autologous Lymphocytes
To determine the feasibility and safety of administering a regimen of TIL/IL-2, using a cell product manufactured in the Yale Advanced Cell Therapy Laboratories, in subjects with metastatic melanoma who are not responding or have progressed after receiving prior therapy with a PD-1/PD-L1 antagonist used alone or in combination with anti-CTLA-4. Additionally, a second cohort of patients with metastatic melanoma who are not responding or have progressed after receiving prior therapy with a PD-1/PD-L1 antagonist alone or in combination with anti-CTLA-4 will receive anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 therapy with Nivolumab and Ipilimumab.
Metastatic Melanoma
DRUG: Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes|DRUG: Nivolumab and Ipilimumab
Adverse Events, To determine the safety of administering a regimen of TIL/IL-2, incidence of drug-related adverse events (AEs) will be summarized across adverse event type in terms of frequency by event type., up to 12 months|Serious Adverse Events, To determine the safety of administering a regimen of TIL/IL-2, serious adverse events (SAEs) will be summarized across event type in terms of frequency by event type. SAE's will include events leading to discontinuation, deaths and clinical laboratory test abnormalities, up to 12 months
Objective response rate to TIL, Objective response rate (ORR) of the TIL/IL-2 regimen based on investigator review of radiographic images using RECIST 1.1 criteria, up to 12 months
Assessment of Immune features of TIL: 4-1BB, to conduct a preliminary assessment of TCR clonotypes using deep sequencing of TCRs from the cell product and of immunologic markers present in marker positive CD8+ cells (specifically 4-1BB, LAG-3, TIM-3, PD-1), up to 12 months|Assessment of Immune features of TIL: LAG-3, to conduct a preliminary assessment of TCR clonotypes using deep sequencing of TCRs from the cell product and of immunologic markers present in marker positive CD8+ cells (specifically 4-1BB, LAG-3, TIM-3, PD-1), up to 12 months|Assessment of Immune features of TIL: TIM-3, to conduct a preliminary assessment of TCR clonotypes using deep sequencing of TCRs from the cell product and of immunologic markers present in marker positive CD8+ cells (specifically 4-1BB, LAG-3, TIM-3, PD-1), up to 12 months|Assessment of Immune features of TIL: PD-1, to conduct a preliminary assessment of TCR clonotypes using deep sequencing of TCRs from the cell product and of immunologic markers present in marker positive CD8+ cells (specifically 4-1BB, LAG-3, TIM-3, PD-1), up to 12 months
The objectives of this study have been expanded since its original registration to inlcude an additional cohort of patients (now designated Cohort 1 and Cohort 2). Cohort 1 is the original group of patients described in the initial registration of the study.

Cohort 1 Objectives:

* To determine the feasibility and safety of administering a regimen of TIL/IL-2, using a cell product manufactured in the Yale Advanced Cell Therapy Laboratories, in subjects with metastatic melanoma who are not responding or have progressed after receiving prior therapy with a PD-1/PD-L1 antagonist used alone or in combination with anti-CTLA-4.
* To assess for evidence of clinical activity.
* To conduct a preliminary assessment of the TCR clonotypes present in marker positive CD8+ cells (4-1BB, LAG-3, TIM-3, PD-1) versus marker-negative CD8+ T-cells early in the expansion cultures and compare to clonotypes late in the final product and in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) 1 and 2 months post infusion.

Cohort 2 Objectives:

* To determine the feasibility and safety of administering a regimen of TIL/IL-2, using a cell product manufactured in the Yale Advanced Cell Therapy Laboratories, followed by anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 therapy with Nivolumab and Ipilimumab in subjects with metastatic melanoma who are not responding or have progressed after receiving prior therapy with a PD-1/PD-L1 antagonist alone or in combination with anti-CTLA-4.
* To evaluate the efficacy of TIL/IL-2 therapy in combination with subsequent anti-PD-1 Nivolumab and anti-CTLA-4 Ipilimumab by assessing the objective response rate by immune-related RECIST (irRECIST).
* To conduct a preliminary assessment of the TCR clonotypes present in marker positive CD8+ cells (e.g. 4-1BB, LAG-3, TIM-3, PD-1) versus marker-negative CD8+ T-cells early in the expansion cultures and compare to clonotypes late in the final product and in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) 1 and 2 months post infusion.
