* Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a cancer of bone marrow that leads to an increased number of white blood cells. CML is more prevalent in the elderly and is characterized by weight loss, tiredness, shortness of breath, excessive sweating, bone pain, and frequent infections. \[1\] According to the American Cancer Society's estimates, CML represents 15% of all new leukemia cases.\[2\] The global burden of disease (GBD) study 2015 revealed that leukemia was under the top ten leading causes of death globally.\[3\] However, the latest GBD study found a decrease in the age-standardized incidence rate and the death rate from 1990-2017.\[4\] This dramatic improvement in the overall survival and health-related quality of life among CML patients was attributed to the impact of new therapeutic strategies. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), particularly imatinib, emerged as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of CML, reducing epidemiological burden (incidence rate), and improve quality of life.\[5\]
* The definition and classification of chronic kidney disease (CKD) have evolved over time, but current international guidelines define this condition as decreased kidney function shown by glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of less than 60 mL/min per 1â€¢73 m2, or markers of kidney damage, or both, of at least 3 months duration, regardless of the underlying cause\[6\] Diagnosis is commonly made after chance findings from screening tests (urinary dipstick or blood tests), or when symptoms become severe. The best available indicator of overall kidney function is GFR, which is measured either via exogenous markers (eg, DTPA, iohexol), or estimated using equations. Presence of proteinuria is associated with increased risk of progression of CKD and death. Presence of proteinuria is associated with increased risk of progression of CKD and death.\[7,8\] Kidney biopsy samples can show definitive evidence of CKD, through common changes such as glomerular sclerosis, tubular atrophy, and interstitial fibrosis. Complications include anaemia due to reduced production of erythropoietin by the kidney; reduced red blood cell survival and iron deficiency; and mineral bone disease caused by disturbed vitamin D, calcium, and phosphate metabolism.\[9
