A Study of TFX05-01 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is an open-label, non-randomized, multicenter, Phase Ⅰ/Ⅱa study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of TFX05-01 in patients with advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: TFX05-01
Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AE) [Safety and Tolerability], AE will be graded according to the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0., Through study completion (About two years)|Electrocardiogram (ECG) changes [Safety and Tolerability], Resting 12-lead ECGs will be obtained from all subjects in order to assess any impact TFX05-01 may have on the QT interval as assessed by the Fridericia's Correction Formula (QTcF)., Through study completion (About two years)|Monitoring of Vital signs [Safety and Tolerability], Vital sign will be obtained from all subjects., Through study completion (About two years)|Monitoring of hematology and blood chemistry [Safety and Tolerability], Hematology and blood chemistry will be obtained from all subjects., Through study completion (About two years)|Monitoring of coagulation function [Safety and Tolerability], Coagulation function will be obtained from all subjects., Through study completion (About two years)|Monitoring of urinalysis [Safety and Tolerability], Urinalysis will be obtained from all subjects., Through study completion (About two years)|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), MTD as determined by percentage of participants with dose limiting toxicities (DLTs)., Through the end of the first cycle (Days 1-21)|Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D), RP2D as determined by percentage of participants with DLTs and cumulative safety., Through study completion (About two years)
Pharmacokinetics (PK) - Time to maximum concentration (Tmax), Tmax of TFX05-01 will be computed for each subject where possible., Throughout Days 1 and 8 of Cycle 1 and Days 1 of Cycle 2-N (21 days for each cycle)|PK - Maximum peak plasma concentration (Cmax), Cmax of TFX05-01 will be computed for each subject where possible., Throughout Days 1 and 8 of Cycle 1 and Days 1 of Cycle 2-N (21 days for each cycle)|PK - Terminal Elimination Half-life (T1/2), T1/2 of TFX05-01 will be computed for each subject where possible., Throughout Days 1 and 8 of Cycle 1 and Days 1 of Cycle 2-N (21 days for each cycle)|PK -Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), AUC of TFX05-01 will be computed for each subject where possible., Throughout Days 1 and 8 of Cycle 1 and Days 1 of Cycle 2-N (21 days for each cycle)|The overall response rate (ORR), ORR will be estimated based on the proportion of evaluable patients whose overall response (ORR) during study treatment is CR or PR. Disease response will be assessed by the investigator using RECIST v1.1., Through study completion (About two years)|Duration of response (DoR), DoR assessed by RECIST 1.1 criteria., Through study completion (About two years)|Disease control rate (DCR), DCR assessed by RECIST 1.1 criteria., Through study completion (About two years)|Progression free survival (PFS), PFS assessed by RECIST 1.1 criteria., Through study completion (About two years)|Overall survival (OS), The time from randomization to death for any reason., Through study completion (About two years)
The study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of TFX05-01 in patients with advanced solid tumors, which was divided into dose exploration part (Phase Ⅰ) and indication exploration part (Phase Ⅱa). Each Phase of the study consisted of a screening period (21 days before initial dosing), a treatment period (from the first trial to the onset of an endpoint event), and a follow-up period.
