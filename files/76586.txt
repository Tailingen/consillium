Sequential and Personalized PK-guided Busulfan Administration in the Frame of the Conditiong Regimen for Allo-HSCT in Patients With Malignant Hemopathies Ineligible for the Standard Myeloablative Conditioning
Because the anti-leukemic activity of busulfan, this dug is largely used in graft conditioning but in elderly and/or cormobid patienth an excess of toxicity is observed. This study focus on the possibility of significanty reducing this toxicity by customizing the doses of busulfan to individual PK parameters.
