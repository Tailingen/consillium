A Study Evaluating Efficacy and Safety of Mosunetuzumab in Combination With Polatuzumab Vedotin Compared to Rituximab in Combination With Gemcitabine Plus Oxaliplatin in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Aggressive B-Cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
This study will assess the efficacy and safety of mosunetuzumab in combination with polatuzumab vedotin (M+P) in participants with relapsed or refractory (R/R) diffuse-large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), high-grade B-cell lymphoma, transformed follicular lymphoma (trFL) and FL Grade 3B (FL3B) in comparison with a commonly used regimen in this participant population, rituximab, gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (R-GemOx).
