Beta Glucan's Effect on Pembrolizumab Immunologic Response in Stage III-IV Melanoma
The purpose of this study is to determine how beta-glucan affects the immune system in subjects with melanoma.
Melanoma Stage III|Melanoma Stage IV
DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Beta-Glucan
Changes in percent of lymphocyte cell surface expression markers, The investigators will quantify percent of lymphocyte cell surface e (i.e., CD45, CD3, CD11b, etc.) from each sample collected by mass cytometry \*CyTOF) or flow cytometry, Blood for analysis will be drawn at baseline (Day 0), 3 weeks post pembrolizumab treatment, and 3 weeks post pembrolizumab plus oral beta-glucan treatment.|Changes in absolute number of lymphocyte cell surface expression markers, The investigators will quantify absolute number of lymphocyte cell surface (i.e., CD45, CD3, CD11b, etc.) from each sample collected by mass cytometry (CyTOF) or flow cytometry, Blood for analysis will be drawn at baseline (Day 0), 3 weeks post pembrolizumab treatment, and 3 weeks post pembrolizumab plus oral beta-glucan|Changes in the mean fluorescent intensity of lymphocyte cell surface expression markers, The investigators will quantify mean fluorescent intensity of lymphocyte cell surface (i.e., CD45, CD3, CD11b, etc.) from each sample collected by mass cytometry \*CyTOF) or flow cytometry, Blood for analysis will be drawn at baseline (Day 0), 3 weeks post pembrolizumab treatment, and 3 weeks post pembrolizumab plus oral beta-glucan|Changes in percent of intracellular cytokine expression markers, The investigators will quantify percent of intracellular cytokine expression (TNFa, IFNg, etc.) from each sample collected by mass cytometry (CyTOF) or flow cytometry, Blood for analysis will be drawn at baseline (Day 0), 3 weeks post pembrolizumab treatment, and 3 weeks post pembrolizumab plus oral beta-glucan|Changes in absolute number of intracellular cytokine expression markers, The investigators will quantify absolute number of intracellular cytokine expression (TNF-a, IFNg, etc.) from each sample collected by mass cytometry (CyTOF) or flow cytometry, Blood for analysis will be drawn at baseline (Day 0), 3 weeks post pembrolizumab treatment, and 3 weeks post pembrolizumab plus oral beta-glucan|Changes in fluorescent intensity of intracellular cytokine expression markers, The investigators will quantify fluorescent intensity of intracellular cytokine expression (TNF-a, IFNg, etc.) from each sample collected by mass cytometry (CyTOF) or flow cytometry, Blood for analysis will be drawn at baseline (Day 0), 3 weeks post pembrolizumab treatment, and 3 weeks post pembrolizumab plus oral beta-glucan
This is a clinical pilot study using oral beta-glucan on patients with advanced stage III-IV melanoma without evidence of disease receiving adjuvant Pembrolizumab. The aim is to see whether beta-glucan treatment in combination with Pembrolizumab may provide augmented immunologic phenotypes such as decreased peripheral MDSCs, enhanced T effector cell function, or enhanced cytokine production in the peripheral blood or plasm of enrolled subjects. Secondary outcome measures will include clinical endpoints such as recurrence, progression free survival and overall survival.
