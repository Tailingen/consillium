Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer
RATIONALE: Stereotactic body radiation therapy may be able to send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue.

PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of stereotactic body radiation therapy and to see how well it works in treating patients with prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
RADIATION: stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT)- 45 Gy|RADIATION: stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) - 47.5 Gy|RADIATION: stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) - 50 Gy (Phase 1)|RADIATION: stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) - 50 Gy (Phase 2)
Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicity (Phase 1 Only), Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as grade 3 to 5 GI, genito urinary, sexual, or neurologic toxicity attributed to therapy occurring within 90 days of registration using Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events(version 3), 90 days after start of treatment|No. of Late Severe GU Toxicity (for Phase 2 Only), To determine late severe GU toxicity defined as grade 3-5 occurring between 279-540 days (i.e., 9-18 months) from the start of protocol treatment. Toxicity was defined using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v.3.0. CTCAE uses a range of grades from 1 to 5; 1 - Mild 2 - Moderate 3 - Severe 4 - Life-threatening 5 - Death., 18 months|No. of Late Severe GI Toxicity (for Phase 2 Only), To determine late severe GI toxicity defined as grade 3-5 occurring between 279-540 days (i.e., 9-18 months) from the start of protocol treatment. Toxicity was defined using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v.3.0. CTCAE uses a range of grades from 1 to 5; 1 - Mild 2 - Moderate 3 - Severe 4 - Life-threatening 5 - Death., 18 months
GU Toxicity (Only Phase 2), To determine acute severe GU toxicity is defined as grade 3-5 occurring prior to 270 days from the start of the protocol treatment. Toxicity was defined using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v.3.0. CTCAE uses a range of grades from 1 to 5; 1 - Mild 2 - Moderate 3 - Severe 4 - Life-threatening 5 - Death., 9 months from start of treatment|GI Toxicity, To determine acute severe GI toxicity is defined as grade 3-5 occurring prior to 270 days from the start of the protocol treatment. Toxicity was defined using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v.3.0. CTCAE uses a range of grades from 1 to 5; 1 - Mild 2 - Moderate 3 - Severe 4 - Life-threatening 5 - Death., 9 months from start of treatment|Non-GU Toxicity, To determine non-GU (genitourinary) toxicity is defined as grade 3-5. Toxicity was defined using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v.3.0. CTCAE uses a range of grades from 1 to 5; 1 - Mild 2 - Moderate 3 - Severe 4 - Life-threatening 5 - Death., 60 months|Non-GI Toxicity, To determine non-GI (gastrointestinal) toxicity is defined as grade 3-5. Toxicity was defined using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v.3.0. CTCAE uses a range of grades from 1 to 5; 1 - Mild 2 - Moderate 3 - Severe 4 - Life-threatening 5 - Death., 60 months|Freedom From Biochemical Failure, Biochemical failure RTOG (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group)-ASTRO (American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology) definition (also known as Phoenix definition). Thus, when the PSA rises by more than 2 ng/ml above the lowest level (nadir) achieved after treatment, biochemical failure has occurred and the date of the failure is recorded at the time the nadir plus 2 ng/ml level is reached., 36 months|Overall Survival, The survival time will be measured from the date of accession to the date of death., 60 months|Disease Specific Survival, Disease-Specific Survival Disease-specific survival will be measured from the date of study entry to the date of death due to prostate cancer as the percentage of participants who survived the prostrate cancer disease., 60 months|Clinical Progression Including Local/Regional and Distant Relapse, Clinical progression including local/regional and distant relapse is measured using Kaplan-Meier method, 60 months
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To escalate the dose of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) to a tumoricidal dose without exceeding the maximum tolerated dose in patients with organ-confined prostate cancer. (Phase I)
* To determine the late, severe grade 3-5 genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity occurring between 270-540 days (i.e., 9-18 months) from the start of the protocol treatment as assessed by CTCAE v3.0. (Phase II)

Secondary

* To determine the dose-limiting toxicity of SBRT in these patients. (Phase I)
* To determine the 2-year biochemical (PSA) control (freedom from PSA failure), disease-free and overall survival, local control, freedom from distant metastases, and the incidence of high-grade adverse events of any type in patients treated with this therapy in order to determine if the therapy is promising enough for further clinical investigation. (Phase II)

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I dose-escalation study followed by a phase II open-label study.

* Phase I: Patients undergo 5 treatments of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT).
* Phase II: Patients undergo SBRT at the maximum tolerated dose as in phase I. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1.5, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, every 6 months for 5 years, and then once a year for years 5-10.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 97 patients will be accrued for this study.
