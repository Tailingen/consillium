PROton Therapy for Post Surgical Treatment of GYNecologic Cancer
This is a single institution, multi-center, Phase II, single-arm study, using Whole Pelvis (WP) Pencil Beam Scanning Proton Radiation (PBS PRT) in the post-surgical, adjuvant setting for definitive treatment of gynecologic cancers. The purpose of this study is to estimate rate of acute clinician-reported gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity using WP PBS PRT in the definitive treatment of gynecologic cancers in the post-surgical, adjuvant setting.

Acute clinician-reported gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity., Determine the rate of acute clinician-reported gastrointestinal (GI), with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v5.0) criteria. Acute GI grade 2 or higher toxicity is the primary powering endpoint., Up to 6 months after end of treatment at follow up visits
Acute clinician-reported genitourinary (GU) toxicity., Determine the rate of the acute clinician-reported genitourinary (GU) toxicity, with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v5.0) criteria., Up to 6 months after end of treatment at follow up visits|Acute patient-reported gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicity and quality of life., Determine the rate of acute patient-reported gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicity and quality of life using the EPIC urinary and bowel score (expanded prostate cancer index composite) and FACT-Cx., Up to 6 months after end of treatment at follow up visits|Loco-regional recurrence free survival, disease free survival, and overall survival., Determine loco-regional recurrence free survival, disease free survival, and overall survival., Up to 2 years
This is a single institution, multi-site study, and thus will include patients from geographic locations with Penn proton centers in the Philadelphia, Lancaster and South New Jersey area. The study will be conducted at the University of Pennsylvania Department of Radiation Oncology and associated Clinical facilities.

The study intervention is Whole Pelvis (WP) Pencil Beam Scanning Proton Radiation (PBS PRT) as part of the definitive treatment of gynecologic cancers in the post-hysterectomy, adjuvant setting. Patients will be treated with doses of 45 or 50.4 Gy in 1.8 Gy daily fractions.
