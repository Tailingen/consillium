A Phase II Study of Vemurafenib Combined With Acitretin in Patients With Advanced Melanoma
We propose to conduct a phase 2 study to assess whether the addition of acitretin to vemurafenib therapy is able to decrease the rate of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) development, a known side effect of vemurafenib therapy, in patients with advanced melanoma. Further, we seek a preliminary assessment as to whether the addition of acitretin to vemurafenib enhances the clinical efficacy of this anti-melanoma agent.
Malignant Melanoma

Rate of Development of cSCC at 6 Months (Biopsy Confirmed)., 6 months post treatment
Number of Participants With Adverse Events, The study period during which all AEs must be reported begins after informed consent is obtained and initiation of study treatment and ends 30 days following the last administration of study treatment or study discontinuation/termination, whichever is earlier. All adverse events will be classified using either the MedDRA term or NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0, Baseline through 30 Days post Treatment
