Prospective, RCT of Split Thickness Skin Grafts on Lower Leg After Compression Therapy With Compression Bandage vs. NPWT
The single center, prospective, randomized trial includes in total 60 patients. We want to compare two different treatment methods for compression therapy for split thickness skin graft in lower leg. The patients are randomized to compression therapy with NPWT (negative pressure wound therapy) using the device PICO or using the compression bandage with Coban 2 lite.

Primary outcome is complete healing of the skin transplant 30 days postoperatively. Secondary outcomes will be to note frequency of infection, bleeding, loss of transplant etc.
