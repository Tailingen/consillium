A Multicenter Phase 1b/2 Study of Adagrasib, Cetuximab, and Cemiplimab for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Harboring KRAS G12C Mutations
To learn if the drug combination of adagrasib, cetuximab, and cemiplimab can help to control metastatic CRC with KRAS G12C mutations.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer|KRAS G12C Mutations
DRUG: Cetuximab|DRUG: Cemiplimab|DRUG: Adagrasib
Safety and adverse events (AEs), Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, Through study completion; an average of 1 year.
Primary Objective

â€¢ To determine the objective response rate of the adagrasib, cetuximab, and cemiplimab combination for treatment of advanced KRAS G12C MT CRC that has progressed on at least one line of prior systemic chemotherapy.

Secondary Objectives

* To estimate duration of response (DOR), progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) for the combination of adagrasib, cetuximab, and cemiplimab in participants with advanced KRAS G12C MT CRC that has progressed on at least one line of prior systemic chemotherapy.
* To estimate the safety and tolerability of the combination of adagrasib, cetuximab, and cemiplimab in participants with advanced KRAS G12C MT CRC that has progressed on at least one line of prior systemic chemotherapy.

Exploratory Objectives

* To assess predictive biomarkers of response and resistance to the combination of adagrasib, cetuximab, plus cemiplimab.
* To assess mechanisms of tumor cell adaptation upon treatment with the combination of adagrasib, cetuximab, plus cemiplimab.
* To determine mechanisms of acquired resistance to the combination of adagrasib, cetuximab, plus cemiplimab.
* To assess the effect of the combination of adagrasib, cetuximab plus cemiplimab on the immune tumor microenvironment.
* To generate cell lines and participant derived xenograft (PDX) models from tumor samples.
