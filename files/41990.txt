HER-2 Protein Vaccine in Treating Women With Breast Cancer
RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of HER-2 protein vaccine in treating women who have breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: HER-2/neu peptide vaccine
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine the safety of HER-2 protein AutoVac™ in women with breast cancer.

Secondary

* Determine the ability of this drug to bypass the tolerance to the HER-2 self-protein by raising HER-2 antibodies in these patients.
* Determine the kinetics of the immune response to HER-2/neu in patients treated with this drug.

OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

Patients receive HER-2 protein AutoVac™ intramuscularly at weeks 0, 2, 6, and 10 in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

Patients are followed for up to 6 weeks.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 months.
