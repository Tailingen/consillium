Phase 2 Midostaurin in Aggressive Systemic Mastocytosis and Mast Cell Leukemia
The safety and efficacy of midostaurin (PKC412), a novel investigational drug, will be evaluated on the basis of response rate, when administered to patients with aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM) or mast cell leukemia (MCL)
Systemic Mastocytosis, Aggressive (ASM)|Leukemia, Mast Cell|Hematological Non-mast Cell Lineage Disease (AHNMD)
DRUG: Midostaurin
Subjects With Clinical Response [Partial Response (PR) + Complete Response (CR)], Clinical Response \[PR + CR\] will be assessed after 2 cycles of treatment, with each cycle being 28 days (4 weeks) in length.

Except as otherwise noted, the minimum criteria for PR is improvement by at least 50% from the baseline value towards the indicated value for one or more of the criteria below:

BONE MARROW \& BLOOD

* ANC \<1000/uL
* Hb \<10 g/dL
* Platelets \>100,000/uL LIVER
* If hepatomegaly with ascites, decrease in frequency of paracenteses by 50%
* Elevated enzyme levels \> upper limit of normal (ULN)
* Hypoalbuminemia \< ULN
* Portal hypertension \> ULN SPLEEN
* If palpable splenomegaly with hypersplenism/thrombocytopenia, hypersplenism markers improved GI TRACT
* If malabsorption with hypoalbuminemia and/or weight loss, albumin improved BONES
* If huge osteolyses or/and severe osteoporosis with pathologic fractures, partial resolution of osteolyses

Subjects with PR or greater continue, those without response discontinue., 2 months
Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival will be assessed after 12 cycles of treatment, with each cycle being 28 days (4 weeks) in length. 12 cycles of treatment is considered to be about 11 months., 11 months|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival was assessed as the median duration of survival at the time of data cut-off, and reported with 95% confidence interval., 40 months
This study assesses the activity and safety profile of twice-daily oral doses of midostaurin in patients with aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM) or mast cell leukemia (MCL) with or without associated clonal hematological non-mast cell lineage disease (AHNMD).

Aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM) and mast cell leukemia (MCL) are characterized by excessive bone marrow production of mast cells which can can infiltrate tissues and release harmful substances, resulting in organ damage. These diseases have very limited treatment options and poor prognosis. Existing treatments for in advanced mast cell disease, eg, interferon-alpha; corticosteroids; and/or cladribine, exhibit low response rates that are usually partial in nature.
