Application of hybridAPC in the Treatment of Barrett
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the new technique of HybridAPC in the treatment of Barrett.
Barrett's Esophagus
DEVICE: HybridAPC
radical rate, Radical rate was defined as it that after 3 months of treatment, the primary lesion area returning to normal is reconfirmed by pathological diagnosis., 3 months
recurrence, Recurrence was defined as it that after 3 months of treatment, Barrett's esophagus is reconfirmed by pathological diagnosis in the primary lesion again., 3 months|adverse event, Adverse event was defined as any device treatment-related adverse event such as bleeding and perforation, 1 year|operation time, Operation time was defined as the time from the beginning of submucosal injection to the final end of ablation., 1 day
After thermal ablation of Barrett's esophagus, stricture formation is reported in 5 to over 10% of patients. Submucosal fluid injection prior to ablation may lower the risk of stricture formation. The new technique of HybridAPC which combines submucosal injection with APC is considered to reduce the complication.
