Cladribine in Combination With GAP in Patients With Refractory/Relapsed Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
The vast majority of patients with ALL will die of the disease, and no standard chemotherapy regimen were defined for patients with relapsed/refractory ALL.Our previous experience has shown that Cladribine in combination of GAP (G-CSF priming, low dose cytarabine, and Pegaspargase) are effective with tolerable toxicity profiling.Thus, this phase 2 clincial trial is going to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cladribine in combination with G-CSF, low-dose cytarabine and Pegaspargase (C-GAP) in patients with refractory/relapsed acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
DRUG: Cladribine|DRUG: G-CSF|DRUG: Cytarabine|DRUG: Pegaspargase
CR rate, Complete Remission: less than 5% blasts in bone marrow, Bone marrow aspiration will be done within 2 weeks after blood cell count recovery (about 4 weeks after initiation of C-GAP treatment
ALL is common in the elderly patients, who can not tolerate the intensified treatments. The vast majority of patients with ALL will die of the disease, and no standard chemotherapy regimen were defined for patients with relapsed/refractory ALL. Our previous experience has shown that Cladribine in combination of GAP(G-CSF priming, low dose cytarabine, and Pegaspargase) are effective with tolerable toxicity profiling.Thus, this phase 2 clincial trial is going to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cladribine in combination with G-CSF, low-dose cytarabine and aclarubicin (C-CAG) in patients with refractory/relapsed acute myeloid leukemia.
