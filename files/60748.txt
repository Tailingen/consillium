Efficacy and Safety Study of DURVALUMAB Maintenance in Patients With Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
The aim of this study is to evaluate the real-life efficacy of durvalumab treatment in consolidation after radio-chemotherapy.

Real-life efficacy of durvalumab treatment in maintenance after chemoradiotherapy., progression-free survival, 1 year
Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) such as anti-PD-1/PD-L1 have revolutionized the field of immuno-oncology, inducing significant and durable responses in patients with all types of tumor, and in particular advanced stage (II-IV) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The use of durvalumab in consolidation, after radiochemotherapy, in locally advanced NSCLC has significantly improved progression-free survival and overall survival (see PACIFIC trial). Durvalumab now has marketing authorization for this indication, in cases of PD-L1â‰¥1% overexpression on tumor cells.

However, 50% of patients experience tumor progression at 1 year, and there is currently no biomarker (clinical, biological or radiological) predictive of tumor response to durvalumab in consolidation.

Elucidating the determinants of response and resistance to treatment, as well as predicting severe immune-mediated adverse events, are essential to improving patient outcomes and developing new therapeutic strategies
