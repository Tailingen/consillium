DRUG: Enasidenib
Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Treatment-emergent adverse events included any adverse events (AEs) occurring or worsening on or after the first dose of study drug and within 28 days after the last dose of the study drug. Severity was graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03 or according to the following scale: Grade 1= Mild AE, Grade 2= Moderate AE, Grade 3= Severe AE, Grade 4= Life-threatening or disabling AE, Grade 5= Fatal, death related to AE.

A serious AE is any AE occurring at any dose that:

* Resulted in death;
* Was life-threatening;
* Required or prolonged existing inpatient hospitalization;
* Resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;
* Was a congenital anomaly/birth defect;
* Constituted an important medical event.

Relationship to study drug administration was determined by the investigator as not related, possibly related, or probably related; all AEs classified as possibly or probably related were considered treatment-related., From first dose of study drug to 28 days after last dose; median (minimum, maximum) duration of exposure was 66 (8, 197) days across all cohorts.|Number of Participants With Dose-limiting Toxicities, Toxicities were graded and documented according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.03. A dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as an event considered related to enasidenib and meeting 1 of the following criteria:

Non-hematologic:

- All clinically significant non-hematologic toxicities CTCAE ≥ Grade 3, considered not related to underlying disease or intercurrent illness, with the exception of ≥ Grade 3 blood bilirubin increases in participants with a uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide A1 (UGT1A1) mutation. In participants with a UGT1A1 mutation, blood bilirubin increases of \> 5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) were considered a DLT.

Hematologic:

- Drug-related, prolonged myelosuppression of ≥ Grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia lasting beyond Day 28 of Cycle 1 unless related to bone marrow involvement by AITL., Cycle 1 (28 days)|Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status at Each Visit, ECOG performance status is used by doctors and researchers to assess how a subjects disease is progressing, assess how the disease affects the daily living activities of the subject and determine appropriate treatment and prognosis.

* 0 = Fully active (most favorable activity);
* 1 = Restricted activity but ambulatory;
* 2 = Ambulatory but unable to carry out work activities;

CR: Disappearance of all evidence of disease, including nodal masses, extra nodal masses, and bone marrow.

PR: Regression of measurable disease and no new sites (≥ 50% decrease in size from Baseline of all index lesions (both nodal and extranodal lesions), no obvious increase in non-index lesions/disease, fludeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid or positron emission tomography (PET) positive prior to therapy; one or more PET positive at previously involved site, variably FDG-avid or PET negative; regression on computed tomography (CT), no increase in size of liver or spleen)., Response assessments were performed every 56 days up to the end of treatment; median (minimum, maximum) duration of treatment was 50.0 (34, 112), 51.5 (41, 57), 40.0 (4, 170), and 27.0 (3, 126) days in each treatment group respectively.
Maximum Increase From Baseline in Corrected QT Interval Based on Fridericia's Formula (QTcF) by Category, QT interval was measured by electrocardiogram throughout the study. The maximum increase in QTcF from Baseline observed across all assessments is reported according to the following categories: increase ≤ 30 milliseconds (ms), increase \> 30 to ≤ 60 ms, and increase \> 60 ms., Baseline, Cycle 1 Days 1, 8, 15, and 22, Cycle 2 Days 1 and 15 and Day 1 of every cycle thereafter.
The first portion of the study is a dose escalation phase where cohorts of patients will receive ascending oral doses of enasidenib to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended Phase 2 dose. The second portion of the study is a planned dose expansion phase where three cohorts of patients will receive enasidenib to further evaluate the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity. Anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.

Enrollment into the AG221-C-003 study was closed following enrollment of the dose escalation Cohort 4 (650 mg QD) in order to focus resources on the development of other pipeline IDH inhibitors in solid tumors, gliomas, and lymphoma; it was not due to safety reasons. Participants receiving enasidenib at the time of study closure were to be allowed to continue treatment until disease progression or the development of unacceptable toxicity, as outlined in the study protocol.
