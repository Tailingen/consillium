Background: Following elective colorectal surgery, rates of re-admission are high and result in significant healthcare resource use. However, up to 20% of these re-admissions may be preventable. This represents an opportunity to improve patient outcomes, reduce health care utilization and costs through targeted interventions.

Home To Stay is an integrated discharge monitoring program using a mobile app platform that was developed to support the needs of patients following discharge after colorectal surgery. In the initial pilot testing, the 30-day re-admission rate for patients using Home to Stay was reduced from 18% to 6% and patient anxiety was reduced in over 75% of the participants.

Methods: This study is a two arm, single center, randomized control trial that will be conducted in the colorectal unit of an academic tertiary care center. Patients will be randomized1:1 using a single randomized consent design to either usual follow up in the control group or post discharge monitoring with Home to Stay in the intervention group.

Objective: The objective of this study is to evaluate the Home to Stay app and its effect on healthcare utilization and patient reported outcomes.
