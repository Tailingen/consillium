Pralatrexate and Bexarotene in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma
This study is designed to determine the recommended dose, safety, pharmacokinetics, and early efficacy of the combination of pralatrexate plus oral bexarotene in patients with relapsed or refractory CTCL.

Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) Rate, DLT rate is the number of patients experiencing a DLT divided by number of evaluable patients and it will be summarized by dose level., Assessed weekly through cycle 1 (weeks 1-4)
Overall Response Rate (ORR), best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of treatment until PD.

The objective response rate is the proportion of patients with a best overall response of either CR or PR and it will be summarized by dose level and overall., Assessed after every 2 cycles (8 weeks) for the first 12 months, then every 4 cycles (16 weeks) until progression of disease.|Number of Patients with Treatment-related Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious AEs (SAEs), (CTCAE) Scale, Version 4.0 for AE grading.

* Grade 3 neutropenia lasting for ≥ 7 days or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) administered.
* Grade 3 thrombocytopenia.
* Grade 3 treatment-related hyperlipidemia or hypothyroidism
* Grade 3 study treatment-related non-hematologic toxicity, Recorded at all study visits: weekly (every 7 +/- 2 days) while on treatment and at safety follow-up (35 +/- 5 days post-last dose) or early termination visit (at time of withdrawal).|Pharmacokinetic Parameters, This was collected during the dose-finding stage of the study. PK sampling is not included in the cohort expansion., Sampling through 24 hours post end-injection of pralatrexate in cycle 1 dose 1 (week 1) and cycle 1 dose 3 (week 3).
This is a multi-center, dose-finding, Phase 1 study of pralatrexate plus bexarotene in patients who have relapsed or refractory CTCL.

Primary Objective(s):

• Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose of pralatrexate plus bexarotene with concurrent vitamin B12 and folic acid supplementation when administered to patients who have failed prior systemic treatment.

Secondary Objective(s):

* Determine the safety profile of pralatrexate plus bexarotene when administered to patients with relapsed/refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL).
* Collect preliminary efficacy data.
* Determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of pralatrexate plus bexarotene in patients who underwent plasma PK sampling
