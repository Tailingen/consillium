The Effect of Prebiotic Inulin on Patients Affected by R/M HNSCC Treated With Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors
The PRINCESS study is a hypothesis-generating, interventional, open-label, non pharmacological trial designed to characterize the translational and clinical implications of the regular assumptions of inulin on Gut Microbiota, circulating cytokines and immune cells dynamics during ICIs +/- chemotherapy on patients affected by R/M HNSCC.

Alpha diversity and Beta diversity analysis in the Gut Microbiota, Comparison of gut microbiota diversity with Shannon index in faeces samples. The analyses were conducted using QIIME software, 12 month|Evaluation of circulating cytokines dynamics, Analysis of multiple cytokines for identify a cytokine signature related to a patient's outcome and be able to recognize patients who will benefit from treatment.

Plasma Levels of 18 Cytokines TGF-, TNF-, VEGF, INF-, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-15, CCL-2, CCL4, CCL-22, and CXCL-10 were evaluated with the Ella Simple Plex system (ProteinSimpleâ„¢, San Jose, CA, USA)The concentrations were expressed in pg/mL.

IL-21 was assessed with the ELISA method (R \& D System, Minneapolis, MN, USA). The measured optical densities were expressed as pg/mL., 12 month|Rate and evaluation of modification of circulating immune-phenotype dynamics, Rate and evaluation of modification of main circulating immune characters as T lymphocytes, B Lymphocytes, Tregs, neutrophils, Natural Killer, NKT, MDSC during study combination treatment, 12 month|Evaluation of Immune-predictive molecules, Evaluation of immunomodulatory molecules (PD-1; PD-L1/2; HLA- E; TIM3; LAG3; OX40; VISTA; ICOS) will be assessed at each established time point, 12 month|Overall Survival Rate, OS and the correlation with GM diversity and circulating cytokines and immune cells dynamics., through study completion, an average of 1 year
