Liposomal Paclitaxel Combined Nedaplatin in Treatment of Advanced or Recurrent Esophageal Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerance and efficacy of Liposomal Paclitaxel With Nedaplatin as First-line in patients with Advanced or Recurrent Esophageal Carcinoma
Esophageal Carcinoma
DRUG: Liposomal Paclitaxel|DRUG: Nedaplatin
Response rate, To assess the response rate of Liposomal Paclitaxel and Nedaplatin in patients with pretreated advanced or recurrent esophageal carcinoma. Possible evaluations include: Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the size of target lesions. Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the size of target lesions. Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD., from date of baseline measured to date of first CT evaluation，Up to 3 months
progression-free survival, Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the date of study enrollment to the date of objectively determined PD or death from any cause, whichever comes first. For patients who are still alive at the time of analysis, and who do not have PD, PFS will be censored at the date of the last objective progression-free disease assessment., from date of baseline to the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months|overall survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from the date of study enrollment to the date of death from any cause., baseline to date of death from any cause，up to 2 approximately years|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (Toxicity), Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE., Up to 30 days post last dose
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerance and efficacy of Liposomal Paclitaxel With Nedaplatin as First-line in patients with Advanced or Recurrent Esophageal Carcinoma.Patients receive Liposomal Paclitaxel 175mg/m2 and Nedaplatin 80mg/m2 every 21 days until the presence of progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity.
