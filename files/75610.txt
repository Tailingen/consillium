Determining Patterns In Study Experiences of Neuroblastoma Patients
Historically, participation in clinical research is highly skewed towards particular demographic groups of people.

This study will invite several participants to gather a wide range of information on clinical trial experiences for neuroblastoma patients. The aim of the study is to identify the factors that limit the ability of a person to enroll in, as well as complete a clinical trial for treatment of neuroblastoma.

The data collected from this study will help improve future outcomes for all neuroblastoma patients as well as those in under-represented demographic groups.
