CP-675,206 (CTLA4-Blocking Monoclonal Antibody) Combined With Dendritic Cell Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage III or Stage IV Melanoma That Cannot Be Removed With Surgery
RATIONALE: Biological therapies, such as CP-675,206, work in different ways to stimulate the immune system and stop tumor cells from growing. Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. Combining CP-675,206 with vaccine therapy may cause a stronger immune response and kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of CP-675,206 when given with vaccine therapy in treating patients with stage III or stage IV melanoma that cannot be removed with surgery.
Melanoma (Skin)
BIOLOGICAL: maximum tolerated dose of anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 monoclonal antibody
Maximum tolerated dose of anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 monoclonal antibody, 3 months
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose of anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 monoclonal antibody (CTLA4-blocking monoclonal antibody; CP-675,206) administered with autologous dendritic cells pulsed with MART-1 antigen in patients with unresectable stage III or stage IV melanoma.
* Determine the biological activity and immune effects of this regimen in these patients.

Secondary

* Correlate CTLA4 genotype with safety of this regimen and/or immune response in these patients.
* Determine, preliminarily, the efficacy of this regimen, in terms of clinical benefit rate, in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study of anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 monoclonal antibody (CTLA4-blocking monoclonal antibody; CP-675,206).

Patients receive CP-675,206 IV on days 0, 28, 60, and 90 and autologous dendritic cells pulsed with MART-1 antigen intradermally on days 0, 14, and 28. After day 120, patients with stable or responding disease may receive additional doses of CP-675,206 monthly in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity

Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of CP-675,206 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

Patients are followed every 3 months.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-21 patients will be accrued for this study within 3-10 months.
