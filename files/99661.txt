Phase 3 Clinical Study of AK112 for NSCLC Patients
A Randomized, Double-blind, Multi-center, Phase III Clinical Study of AK112 or Placebo Combined With Pemetrexed and Carboplatin in Patients With EGFR-mutant Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Who Have Failed to Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) Treatment
Non-Squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Ivonescimab (SMT112 or AK112) Injection|DRUG: Placebo Injection
Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by IRC per RECIST v1.1 in the ITT population., Up to 2 years

The trial will be performed as a randomized, Double-Blind, Multicenter trial to compare AK112 Plus Pemetrexed and Carboplatin to Placebo Plus Pemetrexed and Carboplatin in Patients with Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Harboring. Approximately 320 subjects will be randomized to the two treatment at the ratio of 1:1. Each enrolled subject will receive an intravenous infusion of the AK112/Placebo Plus Pemetrexed and Carboplatin （Q3W,up to 4 cycles）in treatment periods per the randomization schedule. Afterward, AK112/ Placebo Plus Pemetrexed will be used for maintenance treatment (administered on Day 1 of each cycle, Q3W) up to 2 years.
