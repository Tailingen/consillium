Area Under the Concentration Versus Time Curve of Cedazuridine (E7727) and Cedazuridine-epimer, AUC is a measure of the plasma concentration of the drug over time (AUC0-8). PK parameters are reported for the dose escalation stage by cohort in Phase 1 and dose confirmation and fixed-dose combination stages in Phase 2., At specified timepoints from 0 to 24 hours post-dose|Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of Cedazuridine (E7727) and Cedazuridine-epimer, Cmax is the maximum observed plasma concentration. PK parameters are reported for the dose escalation stage by cohort in Phase 1 and dose confirmation and fixed-dose combination stages in Phase 2., At specific timepoints from 0 to 24 hours post-dose|Time to Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Tmax) of Cedazuridine (E7727) and Cedazuridine-epimer, Tmax is the time to maximum observed plasma concentration. PK parameters are reported for the dose escalation stage by cohort in Phase 1 and the dose confirmation and fixed-dose combination stages in Phase 2., At specific timepoints from 0 to 24 hours post-dose|Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of Decitabine, Cmax is the maximum observed plasma concentration.

PK parameters for plasma decitabine are reported for the dose confirmation and fixed-dose combination stages., At specific timepoints from 0 to 24 hours post-dose|Duration of Complete Response in Phase 1, Duration of response (in number of days) was calculated from the first time the response was observed to time of relapse or last time point in the study., Up to 32 Months|Duration of Complete Response in Phase 2 - Kaplan-Meier Estimate, Duration of response (in number of days) was calculated from the first time the response was observed to time of relapse or last time point in the study. Kaplan-Meier estimate for complete response is shown., Up to approximately 29 months|Mean Maximum %LINE Demethylation in Phase 1, Mean maximum % long interspread nuclear element-1 (LINE-1) demethylation decrease from baseline after oral decitabine + cedazuridine (E7727) or ASTX727 compared with IV decitabine 20 mg/m\^2 in the dose escalation stage., Pre-dose to Day 28 in Course 2 (28 days per course)|Number of Participants With Overall Response in Phase 1, The evaluation of response was based on International Working Group 2006 MDS Response Criteria, with overall response calculated as number of participants with complete response+partial response+marrow complete response+hematological improvement (CR+PR+mCR+HI)., Up to 32 months|Number of Participants With Adverse Events, Number of participants with any treatment-emergent adverse event (AE) and any AE graded ≥3 using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0., Up to 5 years|Number of Participants With Hematological Improvement, Hematological improvement was calculated as defined by the IWG 2006 MDS Response Criteria., Up to 32 months|Number of Participants With Transfusion Independence, Transfusion independence was calculated based on the number of transfusion-dependent participants at baseline who had no red blood cell or platelet transfusions for 56 consecutive days or more after treatment., Up to 32 months|Number of Participants to Reach Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) or Death, Number of participants to reach the event (AML or death), where time to reach AML was calculated as the number of days from the day the participant received the first dose of IV decitabine, oral decitabine + E7727, or the FDC tablet to the date of death or the date of MDS progression to AML as defined by ≥20% blasts in bone marrow or peripheral blood using the World Health Organization classification. Time to AML or death was censored on the last date of contact if a participant was lost to follow up prior to reaching a time-to-event endpoint., Up to 32 months|Number of Participants With Overall Survival, Overall survival was defined as the number of days from the day the participant received the first dose of IV decitabine, oral decitabine + E7727, or the FDC tablet to the date of death, regardless of cause., Up to 32 months
The trial was designed to define daily doses of the individual components (cedazuridine \[E7727\] or decitabine) so that decitabine exposure after oral administration would be comparable to exposure after IV decitabine at the approved daily dose of 20 mg/m\^2. The main objective of Phases 1 and 2 was to establish and confirm the doses of the 2 components to be used in the final fixed-dose combination (FDC) product (ASTX727) using mainly pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as endpoints.
