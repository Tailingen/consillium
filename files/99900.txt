Apatinib With Albumin-bound Paclitaxel in Patients With Platinum-resistant Recurrent Ovarian Cancer
The study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of apatinib with albumin-bound paclitaxel in patients with platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer.
Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: albumin-bound paclitaxel|DRUG: Apatinib
ORR, Objective Response Rate, Baseline up to cycle 4 (assessed at Baseline, at the time of pre-surgery)up to approximately 12 months
OS, Overall Survival, through study completion, an average of 5 year|PFS, Progression-Free Survival, through study completion, an average of 5 year|DCR, Disease Control Rate, Baseline up to cycle 4 (assessed at Baseline, at the time of pre-surgery)up to approximately 12 months
The study is an open, one-arm, prospec will collect 35 patients with platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer treated with apatinib with albumin-bound paclitaxel from 2019 to 2020 in Henan Cancer Hospital.Antiangiogenic treatments have been implicated to play a major role in ovarian cancer (OC). Apatinib, a novel oral antiangiogenic agent targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR2), in combination with weekly paclitaxel, may improve clinical outcomes compared with apatinib or paclitaxel alone in patients with refractory or platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.
