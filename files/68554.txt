Derazantinib and Atezolizumab in Patients With Urothelial Cancer
The purpose of this study was to evaluate efficacy of derazantinib monotherapy or derazantinib-atezolizumab in combination in patients with advanced urothelial cancer harboring fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) genetic aberrations (GA) of various clinical stages of disease progression and prior treatments.

DRUG: Derazantinib 300 mg once daily monotherapy|DRUG: Derazantinib 200 mg once daily + atezolizumab 1200 mg|DRUG: Derazantinib 300 mg once daily+ atezolizumab 1200 mg|DRUG: Derazantinib 200 mg twice daily + atezolizumab 1200 mg|DRUG: Derazantinib 300 mg once daily monotherapy (QD)|DRUG: Derazantinib 300 mg once daily + atezolizumab 1200 mg|DRUG: Derazantinib 200 mg twice daily monotherapy
Objective Response Rate (ORR) Based on RECIST 1.1 (Substudies 1,3,4 and 5), ORR was defined as the proportion of patients who achieved a confirmed clinical response (CR) or partial response (PR) by blinded investigator central review (BICR) using the internationally recognized criteria for the radiological assessment in tumor response of solid tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1, From first dose up to 2 years|Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of Derazantinib-atezolizumab in Combination Based on DLT Criteria, Safety and Efficacy Data (Substudy 2), The RP2D was determined by a joint decision taken by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC), Investigators, and the Sponsor in reviewing the aggregate of DLT and AE data, and considering efficacy data, From first dose up to 2 years|Number of Patients With Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs) in Substudy 2, In Substudy 2, the primary endpoint was the number of patients with DLTs. A DLT was defined as a clinically-significant adverse event (AE) or abnormal laboratory value assessed as unrelated to disease progression, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medications. Any DLT had to be a toxicity considered at least possibly related to derazantinib or the combination of derazantinib and atezolizumab, From first dose up to 2 years
Disease Control Rate (DCR) Per RECIST 1.1 in All Substudies, DCR was defined as the proportion of patients who achieved a confirmed clinical response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) by BICR using the internationally recognized criteria in accordance with RECIST Version 1.1, From first dose up to 2 years|Duration of Response (DOR) Per RECIST 1.1, DOR was calculated from the first date of documented tumor response (confirmed CR or PR) to the date of disease progression as assessed by BICR or death per RECIST 1.1, From first dose up to 2 years|ORR Based on RECIST 1.1 (Substudy 2), ORR was defined as the proportion of patients who achieved a confirmed clinical response (CR) or partial response (PR) by blinded investigator central review (BICR) using the internationally recognized criteria for the radiological assessment in tumor response of solid tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1, From first dose up to 2 years|Progression-free Survival (PFS) by RECIST in All Substudies, PFS was calculated as the time from cohort assignment until disease progression as assessed by BICR, or death from any cause, whichever came first, From first dose up to 2 years|Overall Survival (OS) in All Substudies, OS was calculated from the date of cohort assignment until death from any cause, From first dose up to 2 years|Number of Patients With at Least Grade 3 Adverse Events (AEs), Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) displayed by increasing severity grades 3 to 5 (CTCAE grade 3/4/5 ), From first dose and until 90 days following the last dose
The study comprised five open-label substudies (1-5) in patients with advanced urothelial cancer harboring FGFR GA (with the exception of substudy 2 which did not require a FGFR GA) who were treated by derazantinib monotherapy or derazantinib in combination with atezolizumab. The study enrolled patients with cisplatin-ineligible status, or patients whose disease progressed after either first-line treatment or prior treatment with FGFR inhibitors.
