A Study of Intravenous VRT106 for Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
A Phase I Study of the Safety and Tolerability of VRT106 Administered Intravenously for Treatment of Patients With Locally Advanced or MetastaticSolid Tumors
Solid Tumors
BIOLOGICAL: VRT106
Evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of VRT106 in Patients with advanced malignanttumors, To evaluate the safety and tolerability of VRT106 in patients with locally advanced/metastatic solid tumours and to explore the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/multiple ascending dose (MAD)/optimal biologically active dose (OBD) and/or the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), which will provide a recommended dose for subsequent clinical trials., About 2 years
To evaluate VRT106 for injection in patients with locally advanced/metastatic solid tumours for safety and tolerability, exploring the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/maximum administered dose (MAD)/optimal bioavailable dose (OBD) and/or the recommended phase II clinical dose (RP2D) to provide a recommended dose for subsequent clinical trials.
