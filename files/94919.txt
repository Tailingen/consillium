Using e-Nose Technology to Identify Early Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to test the ability of a new technology called breathprinting, or electronic nose (e-nose), to detect early-stage lung cancer. Additionally, researchers also want to see if the e-nose technology is more effective at diagnosing lung cancer if the tumor size is larger.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Breathprinting test
Disease status determined by e-nose testing, For each study participant, disease status will be determined by e-nose testing ("cancer" or "no cancer") and by TTNA or surgery ("true" status)., up to 1 month (time to biopsy)
