Neutrophils in Bone Sarcomas
Hypothesis: Tumor infiltrating neutrophils are present in osteosarcomas and chondrosarcomas and

Experimental design: Exploratory observational research

Population: Adult patients with osteosarcoma or chondrosarcoma

Assessment criteria: Determination of the presence of TANs within tumors and their N1 or N2 profile, the presence of other immune cells, and the PDL-1 status of the tumor.

Investigation plan: Proposal to participate at all eligible patient during the preoperative consultation. If the patient agrees to participate in the study he/she will be included. Participation in the study will not affect its coverage. Patient participation will lead to:

* Taking samples from an operative part,
* The collection of demographic data (age, sex, height, weight, body mass index), family history of cancer, history of bone trauma, sports practice, clinical and anatomopathology reports and data, medical history (Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases, Infectious Diseases, Autoimmune Diseases, Bone Metabolism Disorders, Allergies, Menopause, Drug treatments followed, Psychiatric disorders).

Statistical analysis plan: Description in frequency of the presence of TANs, of N1 and N2 profiles, of the presence of other immune cells both qualitatively and quantitatively. Analysis in subgroups on relevant criteria (age, sex, location, type of tumor).
Osteosarcoma, Chondrosarcoma
OTHER: No intervention
Assessment of the presence of neutrophils in sarcoma-affected tissues, Flow cytometry analysis on excised tissues, Time of surgery
Comparison of flow cytometry and histology for neutrophil assessment in sarcoma-affected tissues, Neutrophil identification thanks to CD66b marker with both the techniques, Time of surgery|Identification of neutrophils N1 or N2 profile in sarcoma-affected tissues, Flow cytometry (CD45 CD66b CD182 CD184 CD195), Time of surgery|Identification of non-neutrophil leukocytes in sarcoma-affected tissues, Flow cytometry analysis (CD45 CD3 CD4 CD8 CD19 CD33 CD80 CD163), Time of surgery|Determination of PDL1 status of neutrophils in sarcoma-affected tissues, Flow cytometry analysis (CD45 CD66b CD 274), Time of surgery
