APTIMA HPV 16 18/45 Genotype Assay on the TIGRIS DTS System in Women With ASC-US or Negative Pap Test Results
In both the ASC-US Study and Adjunct Study populations, the objectives are to:

* evaluate the performance characteristics of the AHPV-GT Assay for detecting cervical disease in women with APTIMA HPV Assay positive results and
* evaluate the ability of the AHPV-GT Assay to detect HPV high-risk types 16, 18, and 45 in women with APTIMA HPV Assay positive results.
Human Papillomavirus Infection
Sensitivity of the assay to detect HPV genotypes 16, 18 and/or 45, Sensitivity (%) = TP/(TP + FN) x 100:

True Negative (TN): AHPVGT=Negative, Cervical Disease Status \<CIN2; True Positive (TP): AHPVGT=Positive, Cervical Disease Status CIN2+; False Positive (FP): AHPVGT=Positive, Cervical Disease Status \<CIN2; False Negative (FN): AHPVGT=Negative, Cervical Disease Status CIN2+; Indeterminate: AHPVGT= Invalid, Cervical Disease Status Any; AHPVGT = APTIMA HPV 16 18/45 Genotype Assay, 6 months|Specificity of the assay to give a positive signal only in HPV 16, 18 and/or 45 positive samples, Specificity (%) = TN/(TN + FP) x100:

True Negative (TN): AHPVGT=Negative, Cervical Disease Status \<CIN2; True Positive (TP): AHPVGT=Positive, Cervical Disease Status CIN2+; False Positive (FP): AHPVGT=Positive, Cervical Disease Status \<CIN2; False Negative (FN): AHPVGT=Negative, Cervical Disease Status CIN2+; Indeterminate: AHPVGT= Invalid, Cervical Disease Status Any; AHPVGT = APTIMA HPV 16 18/45 Genotype Assay, 6 months
The APTIMA HPV 16 18/45 Genotype Assay (AHPV-GT Assay) is an in vitro nucleic acid amplification test for the qualitative detection of E6/E7 viral messenger RNA (mRNA) of human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16, 18 and 45 in cervical specimens from women with positive results in the APTIMA HPV Assay. The AHPV-GT Assay can differentiate between samples positive for HPV 16 from those positive for HPV 18 and/or 45, but does not differentiate between HPV 18-positive samples and HPV 45-positive samples. Cervical specimens collected in ThinPrep Pap Test vials containing PreservCyt Solution (Hologic, Inc., Marlborough, Massachusetts) with commercially available collection devices (broom-type collection device or cytobrush/spatula combination) may be tested with the AHPV-GT Assay either pre- or post-Pap processing. The assay is used with the TIGRIS DTS (TIGRIS) System.

In both the ASC-US Study and Adjunct Study populations, the objectives are to:

* evaluate the performance characteristics of the AHPV-GT Assay for detecting cervical disease in women with APTIMA HPV Assay positive results and
* evaluate the ability of the AHPV-GT Assay to detect HPV high-risk types 16, 18, and 45 in women with APTIMA HPV Assay positive results.
