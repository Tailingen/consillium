A Real-world Study to Assess the Use of Siponimod in Spain to Treat Patients With Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis
RESYZE was a non-interventional/observational, retrospective, multi-center study conducted in 28 public and private hospitals in Spain, assessing secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) patients in a real-world setting. Patients underwent clinical assessments and received their standard routine medical care, as determined by their treating physicians. The study used secondary data i.e., electronic medical records (EMR) from hospitals. Patients who met the eligibility criteria were selected from the EMR of each of the sites, to include adult SPMS diagnosed patients who received at least one dose of siponimod during the start of treatment period between April 2021 and 01 September 2022, with a 12-month observation period, regardless of whether or not they continued the treatment. The study compiled data that was available in the hospital EMR from each patient up to 24 months before the first siponimod dose, and 12 months after the first siponimod dose. Data were collected for each patient at regular intervals of 6/12 months and within a window period of ±45 days, as available.

Scores in each of 7 functional systems (Visual, Brain Stem, Pyramidal, Cerebellar, Sensory, Bowel and Bladder, and Cerebral) and an ambulation score were combined to determine the EDSS score. The scale ranges from 0 to 10, with 0 being normal neurological exam and 10 being death due to MS., Baseline|Number of Patients With Cognitive Decline Diagnosis, Baseline|EDSS Cognitive Subscale Score in Patients With Cognitive Decline, The EDSS cognitive subscale is used to grade the decrease in mentation inside the Cerebral Functional System of the EDSS scale.
