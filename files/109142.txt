Study of Treatment for Patients With Cancer of the Eye -Retinoblastoma
Retinoblastoma is a childhood cancer which affects the retina of the eye. The retina is the light sensitive layer of tissue that lines the back of the eyeball; sends visual messages through the optic nerve to the brain. When only one eye is affected, this is known as unilateral retinoblastoma and when both eyes are affected, it is called bilateral retinoblastoma. Treatment for retinoblastoma is individualized for each patient and is based on the form and the stage of the disease (inside the eye or has moved outside). The main goal is always to cure the cancer, and save the life of the child. Treatments are also designed with the hope of saving the vision, while completely destroying the tumor. Therapies may involve surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, and other treatments called focal treatments. Focal treatments may be laser therapy, freezing, or heat treatments meant to shrink and kill the tumor.

In this study, researchers want to investigate how different participants respond to different therapies that are individualized specifically for them. Participants will be divided into three main groups, depending on whether the disease is unilateral or bilateral, and the stage of the disease. One of the main objectives of the study is to investigate how advanced tumors in children with bilateral disease respond to a new combination of chemotherapy with topotecan and vincristine, with G-CSF support. In order to improve results, some children with very advanced disease may receive carboplatin chemotherapy given around the eye at the same time that they receive topotecan by vein. Also, because children with retinoblastoma are diagnosed so early in life and the vision may be significantly impaired, this study will investigate how children develop and how the brain adjusts and compensates for the visual deficits. Finally, this study also investigates the biology of retinoblastoma, in order to understand better how this cancer develops.

Patients were re-classified into 2 groups of early (IC groups A and B) and advanced (IC groups C, D, and E) retinoblastoma. Analysis was done at eye level since each eye in the same patient could be a different group. Patients from stratum A and B were analyzed separately.

Three eyes (2 patients) in stratum B received external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and were also coincident with enucleation surgery, so their event status was not changed. Although the 3 eyes had shorter EFS interval because EBRT occurred (less than 2 years) before the surgery, it did not change the 5-year survival probability., From date on-study to an event or last follow-up|Ocular Survival of Eyes in Stratum A and Stratum B Patients Based on IC Classification, To describe the 5-year ocular survival of eyes outcome of intraocular retinoblastoma with respect to the new International Classification (IC) for Intraocular Retinoblastoma and the AJCC.

Patients from stratum A and B were analyzed separately, From date on-study to an event or last follow-up|Change in Cognitive Functioning, The Early Learning Composite was assessed with Mullen Scales of Early Learning, a measure of developmental functioning appropriate for use with children from birth through age 5. It is an examiner-administered instrument that uses toys, games, pictures, and other objects to elicit information about a child's language, fine and gross motor skills, and overall early learning capabilities. Raw scores are converted to an age-normed standard score (normative mean = 100, SD = 15) for the overall Early Learning Composite. This measure was given at all time points. Higher scores are indicative of better functioning, with scores from 85-115 in the average range., Baseline (at study entry) and at ages 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years and 5 years|Change in Relevant Daily Living Skills, The Adaptive Behavior composite was measured using the Vineland Scales of Adaptive Behavior (VABS) which is an examiner-administered semi-structured interview that assesses adaptive functioning from birth through adulthood. Subscales including motor skills, communication, socialization, and daily living skills combine into an overall adaptive behavior composite which is an age-normed standard score (normative mean = 100, SD = 15). This measure was given at all time points. Higher scores are indicative of better functioning, with scores from 85-115 in the average range., Baseline (at study entry), 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, and 5 years|Change in Parent Report of Social-Emotional Factors, This outcome was measured using the Ages and Stages Questionnaire which is a parent-completed measure of a child's social-emotional functioning. Raw scores are calculated and compared to cut-off points by age (6 months = 45; 1 year = 48; 2 years = 50; 3 years = 59; 5 years =70). Higher scores are indicative of more problems with scores above the cut-off indicating significant concerns warranting additional follow-up. Possible scores range from 0 to 200+, depending on the number of items administered, which varies by the age of the child (19 to 33 items). However, the primary use of this tool is as a screener. Thus, typically, scores are interpreted as they compare to the identified cut-offs, with children who score above the cut-off referred for further evaluation. This measure was given at all time points., Baseline (at study entry), 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, and 5 years|Change in Parenting Stress Index (PSI), The PSI is a commonly used measure of parenting stress. In 101 questions, the PSI delineates between stress as a function of child characteristics (e.g., adaptability, demandingness, mood; Child Domain) and stress as a function of parent characteristics (e.g., depression, sense of competence, social isolation; Parent Domain), as well as an overall stress score (Total Stress). Raw scores are calculated (normative means: Child Doman = 98.4; Parent Domain = 122.7; Total Stress Score = 221.1). This measure was given at all time points. Scores range from 131-320 for Total Stress, 69-188 for Parent Domain, and 50-145 for Child Domain, with higher scores indicative of greater stress (Total: \>260; Parent: \>153, Child: \>122)., Baseline (at study entry), 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, and 5 years|Assessment of School Readiness, The Bracken Basic Concepts Scale was used to assess school readiness. It is an examiner-administered measure that assesses per-academic skills including letter and number recognition, shapes, colors, and understanding of sizes and comparisons. Raw scores are converted into age-normed scaled scores (normative mean = 10, SD = 3) for the School Readiness Composite. Higher scores are indicative of stronger pre-academic skills, with scores from 7 to 13 within the Average range., Patients were assessed at 5 years of age|Number of Participants With Development of Pineal Cysts, The MRI reports from bilateral patients were reviewed and data abstracted regarding pineal gland measurement and information about pineal cysts.

The number of participants with change in pineal gland size is reported here., From diagnosis through 6 years after last patient enrollment|Change in Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions (DPOAEs), For DP_amplitude to be considered valid, a baseline DP_SNR (Distortion Product for Signal-to-noise ratio) for each frequency (1000-8000 Hz) and for each ear (left and right) must be = 6 dB. Any ear with invalid amplitude at baseline for each frequency should be excluded. The DPOAEs amplitude levels were averaged across the right and left ears at each frequency in the patients exhibiting valid DPOAE amplitudes in both ears, resulting in mean DPOAE levels. Subsequently, comparisons between baseline and most recent evaluation (collapsed across ears) for each frequency were made to evaluate if a significant decrease in DPOAE amplitude exists between the two time points., From Diagnosis through 5 years after completion of therapy|Mean Primary Visual Cortex Function: Cluster Size, Functional magnetic resonance imagining (fMRI) was used to investigate primary visual cortex (V1) response to visual stimulation in 105 children being treated for intraocular retinoblastoma.

The BOLD signal was analyzed via a general linear model using Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM, Wellcome Institute of Neuology, London).
