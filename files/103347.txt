Surgery Followed by Radiation Therapy and Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Cancer of the Pancreas
RATIONALE: Surgery to remove the pancreas, some of the small intestine, and lymph nodes may be more effective treatment for cancer of the pancreas than surgery to remove the pancreas and some of the small intestine alone. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy may be an effective treatment for cancer of the pancreas.

PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of surgery to remove the pancreas and a portion of the small intestine with or without removing lymph nodes, followed by radiation therapy and chemotherapy, in treating patients with cancer of the pancreas.
Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: fluorouracil|DRUG: leucovorin calcium|PROCEDURE: conventional surgery|RADIATION: radiation therapy
OBJECTIVES:

* Assess the overall survival of patients with resectable ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma undergoing extended versus standard pancreatoduodenectomy.

OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to undergo standard pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) or PD with extended lymph node resection after an exploratory laparotomy.

Patients receive adjuvant chemoradiation therapy 4-6 weeks after surgery, if no metastases are evident. Radiation therapy is given every week for 5 weeks. Fluorouracil/leucovorin calcium is administered by rapid IV push daily within 2 hours of radiation on days 1-4 of week 1 and days 29-31 of week 5.

Patients are followed every 4 months for the first year, then every 6 months for the next 2 years.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 50 patients will be accrued per group for a total of 100 patients.
