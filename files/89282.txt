Phase II SBRT & Chemo for Unresectable Cholangiocarcinoma Followed by Liver Transplantation
The purpose of this study is to determine progression-free survival at 12 months for stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) and chemotherapy for unresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma (CCA).
Cholangiocarcinoma|Hepatobiliary Neoplasm|Liver Cancer|Bile Duct Cancer|Cancer of Gallbladder
PROCEDURE: Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Capecitabine|DRUG: 5FU|PROCEDURE: Liver transplantation
Progression-free Survival at 12 Months, Progression free survival is defined to be the time to progression of disease or death., 12 months
Pathologic Complete Response Rate, Pathologic complete response will be defined as no residual tumor cells seen on the explanted liver specimen., 12 months|Serum CA 19-9 Levels, Initial level of Cancer antigen 19-9, 12 months|Overall Survival at 12 Months, the estimated probability for the percentage of participants with overall survival at 12 months., 12 months|Liver Transplant Rate, The number of patients receiving liver transplant among patients who initially have tumors â‰¤3 cm, 12 months|Freedom From Local Progression at 12 Months, the proportion of patients who experienced a local recurrence at 12 months with death as a competing risk, 12 months|Liver Transplant Conversion Rate, The ability to successfully perform liver transplant among patients who initially have tumor \>3 cm, 12 months|Median Time to Overall Survival, The time to overall survival is defined as the time to death from any cause. The median was determined via Kaplan Meier methodology., 18 months
Investigators hope to learn more about neoadjuvant SBRT and chemotherapy for unresectable CCA, and if SBRT followed by chemotherapy can lead to successful liver transplantation. This knowledge is important for this patient group as this disease is a highly lethal malignancy that often presents as unresectable, however surgery or transplantation are the only curative options.
