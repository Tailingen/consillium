A Study of All-Trans Retinoic Acid (ATRA) and Bryostatin in Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)
The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of the combination of all-trans retinoic acid in combination with one of two schedules of Bryostatin 1 in patients with myelodysplasia and acute myelogenous leukemia.
Acute Myelogenous Leukemia|Myelodysplastic Syndrome
DRUG: All-trans retinoic acid|DRUG: Bryostatin 1
This study is designed to test the therapeutic effect of combining Bryostatin 1 with the known maximum tolerated dose of all-trans retinoic acid in patients with either MDS or AML.
This study will also determine the ability of Bryostatin 1 in combination with ATRA in humans to induce differentiation of human leukemic cells and to cause changes in the levels of protein kinase C isoenzymes in these cells.
All patients receive all-trans retinoic acid at a dose of 150 mg/m2/day and patients are randomized to one of two schedules of Bryostatin 1.

Arm 1: Bryostatin 1 is administered at a dose of 60 mcg/m2 as a 30 minute intravenous (IV) infusion on days 8 and 22.

Arm 2: Bryostatin 1 is administered at a dose of 40 mcg/m2 as a 72 hour IV infusion starting on days 8 and 22.

Patients are assessed for response on day +50 with a bone marrow examination and patients with either a clinical response or stable disease receive further therapy.

Bryostatin 1 pharmacokinetic samples are to be drawn on days 1, 8 and 50 of each cycle.
