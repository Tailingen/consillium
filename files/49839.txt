Phase I Study of MT110 in Lung Cancer (Adenocarcinoma and Small Cell), Gastric Cancer or Adenocarcinoma of the Gastro-Esophageal Junction, Colorectal Cancer, Breast Cancer, Hormone-Refractory Prostate Cancer, and Ovarian Cancer
This phase I dose escalation study is intended to define the safety, tolerability and maximal tolerable dose (MTD) of MT110 in patients with advanced solid tumors.

MT110 is a bispecific (anti-EpCAM x anti-CD3) T-cell engager (BiTE) designed to link EpCAM (epithelial cell adhesion molecule) expressing cells and T-cells resulting in T-cell activation and a cytotoxic T-cell response against EpCAM+ cells. In vitro and ex-vivo data indicate that EpCAM+ tumor cell lines are sensitive to MT110 mediated cytotoxicity. Furthermore, data from in-vivo experiments with both MT110 and a mouse surrogate molecule (muS110) have confirmed the activity of these molecules in inhibiting the formation of metastases but also against established tumors. In vitro and ex-vivo data suggest that a prolonged presence of the drug in target tissues may result in significant T-cell recruitment, activation and expansion to/in target tissues, potentially resulting in substantial anti-tumor activity in man.
