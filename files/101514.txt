Fasting Mimicking Diet (FMD) in Conjunction With Chemotherapy in Advanced Ovarian Cancer
Rates of grade 3-4 toxicity with carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy range 26-84%. Interventions to reduce toxicity are needed.

Short term fasting protects against toxic effects of chemotherapy without decreasing efficacy. In a prospective clinical trial of breast cancer patients randomized to FMD or regular diet during chemotherapy, less antiemetic was required in the FMD group; radiographic and pathologic responses were better in this group.

This trial tests whether platinum-taxane chemotherapy combined with a FMD in advanced and recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancer patients is associated with decreased toxicity and/ or improved tumor response to therapy.

To determine whether the combination of standard of care platinum-taxane chemotherapy with a FMD compared to a regular diet is associated with decreased gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity in advanced and recurrent ovarian cancer patients., Toxicities and adverse events will be graded and summarized according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), v5.0 and will be compared between the two study groups. The following toxicity summaries will be used to compare the diet and non-diet group:

Any of the following Grade 2+ GI symptomatic toxicities (nausea and vomiting, anorexia, constipation or diarrhea, mucositis, stomatitis) experienced.

The NCI CTCAE has a specific scale (graded 1-5) for each toxicity which can be used objectively to compare different drug toxicities., 6 months|To determine whether the combination of standard of care platinum-taxane chemotherapy with a FMD compared to a regular diet is associated with decreased neurotoxicity in advanced and recurrent ovarian cancer patients., Toxicities and adverse events will be graded and summarized according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), v5.0 and will be compared between the two study groups. The following toxicity summaries will be used to compare the diet and non-diet group:

Any Grade 2+ neuropathy experienced. The NCI CTCAE has a specific scale (graded 1-5) for each toxicity which can be used objectively to compare different drug toxicities., 6 months|To determine whether the combination of standard of care platinum-taxane chemotherapy with a FMD compared to a regular diet is associated with decreased hematologic toxicity in advanced and recurrent ovarian cancer patients., Toxicities and adverse events will be graded and summarized according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), v5.0 and will be compared between the two study groups. The following toxicity summaries will be used to compare the diet and non-diet group:

Any Grade 3+ hematologic toxicity experienced. The NCI CTCAE has a specific scale (graded 1-5) for each toxicity which can be used objectively to compare different drug toxicities., 6 months|To determine whether the combination of standard of care platinum-taxane chemotherapy with a FMD compared to a regular diet is associated with improved quality of life (QOL) in advanced and recurrent ovarian cancer patients, The primary QOL question examines whether chemotherapy plus FMD is associated with improved physical function and reduced chemotherapy-related side effects/ symptoms compared to chemotherapy administered with a regular diet. QOL and side effects/ symptoms of chemotherapy will be recorded using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) ovarian cancer questionnaire and compared between the study groups., 6 months|To determine whether the combination of standard of care platinum-taxane chemotherapy with a FMD compared to a regular diet is associated with improved QOL specifically with regards to less neuropathy in advanced and recurrent ovarian cancer patients, This specific QOL question examines whether chemotherapy plus FMD is associated with improved physical function and reduced chemotherapy-related neuropathy compared to chemotherapy administered with a regular diet. QOL as impacted by neuropathy, specifically will be recorded using the FACT/ Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG)-Neurotoxicity (Ntx) 4-item subscale and compared between the two study groups., 6 months|To determine whether the combination of standard of care platinum-taxane chemotherapy with a FMD compared to a regular diet is associated with improved QOL specifically with regards to less fatigue in advanced and recurrent ovarian cancer patients, This specific QOL question examines whether chemotherapy plus FMD is associated with improved physical function and reduced fatigue compared to chemotherapy administered with a regular diet. QOL as impacted by fatigue, specifically, will be assessed using the 7-item Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) fatigue short form and compared between the two study groups., 6 months
To describe the safety and tolerability of a concurrent FMD, including patient compliance to diet, with platinum-taxane chemotherapy in advanced and recurrent ovarian cancer patients., Safety will be assessed by measuring and comparing adverse events experienced by patients in each study group. This study will utilize the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 to describe and quantify study subject adverse events. In addition the number of patients that do not complete the FMD during chemotherapy will be recorded. The number of cycles completed with the FMD for each patient in the FMD group will be recorded to determine compliance with the regimen., 6 months|To compare radiographic tumor response to therapy in advanced and recurrent ovarian cancer patients treated with the combination of platinum-taxane chemotherapy and a FMD versus a regular diet., Tumor response will be measured radiographically via RECIST 1.1., 6 months|To compare tumor response to therapy using a serum biomarker in advanced and recurrent ovarian cancer patients treated with the combination of platinum-taxane chemotherapy and a FMD versus a regular diet., Tumor response based on change in serum biomarker will be measured using CA 125 blood levels., 6 months|To compare tumor pathologic response to therapy in advanced ovarian cancer patients treated with the combination of platinum-taxane chemotherapy and a FMD versus a regular diet., Tumor pathologic response in the primary (neoadjuvant) treatment group will be measured using a 3-tier chemotherapy response score (CRS). CRS is assigned on a scale of 1-3 with 3 representing the most complete response to treatment (ie best response) and 1 representing the least robust response to treatment (ie worst response)., 6 months|To measure the progression free survival (PFS) at 2 and 5 years in each group., 2 and 5 years|To measure the overall survival (OS) in each group., 5 years
