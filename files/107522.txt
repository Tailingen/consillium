Safety and Tolerability of GemRIS 225 mg in Subjects With Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine if TAR-200, an investigational drug-delivery system, is safe and tolerable in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) between diagnosis and radical cystectomy (RC).
