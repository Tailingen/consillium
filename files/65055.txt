Phase 1 Study of Anti-Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor (Anti-MIF) Antibody in Solid Tumors
The purpose of the study is to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of anti-MIF antibody in subjects with malignant solid tumors (Arm 1) and in subjects with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum (Arm 2).
