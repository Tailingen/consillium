Combined Prostate-specific Antigen, Multi-parametric MRI and Targeted Prostate Biopsy for Prostate Cancer Screening
The study aims to investigate the incidence of prostate cancer among males in Nanjing and whether a combination of PSA, multi-parametric MRI and targeted biopsy is a feasible approach for screening prostate cancer in China.

The investigators are going to collect serum samples and clinical information from men aged ≥50 years taking physical examination in community health service centers in Nanjing. The investigators will propose mpMRI for those with serum PSA ≥4 ng/mL. Transperineal systematic biopsy (TPSB) combined with MRI /ultrasound fusion targeted biopsy (TB) will be offered for those scored ≥3 on the Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System Version 2 (PI-RADS v2). TPSB alone will be offered for those scored \<3 and serum PSA ≥10 ng/mL. Subjects with serum PSA between 4 ng/mL and 10 ng/mL and PI-RADS score \<3 points will be referred to follow-up examinations every 6 months.
