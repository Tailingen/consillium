Toripalimab in Combination With Axitinib in Patients With Localized Mucosal Melanoma
This study is one monocentric, single-arm, open, phase Ⅱ clinical study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Toripalimab monoclonal injection (Tuo Yi) combined with axitinib tablet (Inlyta®) as neoadjuvant therapy for localized mucosal melanoma.

Primary objective: To evaluate pathological response (pCR+pPR) rate of Toripalimab combined with axitinib as neoadjuvant therapy for localized mucosal melanoma.

The subjects will receive Toripalimab and Axitinib combined therapy after enrollment, and receive operation 2 weeks after the last dose of Axitinib. Toripalimab will be given for a total of 4 cycles (8 weeks), whereas Axitinib will be given for a total of 8 weeks.The subjects can receive Toripalimab for up to one year after the operation.
