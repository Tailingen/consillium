Phase I/IIa Trial to Evaluate AVX001 Gel in Doses of 1% or 3% Compared With Vehicle Over Four Weeks of Field-directed Treatment Period in Adult Subjects With AK
Actinic keratosis (AK), also known as solar keratosis, is a common skin condition characterised by abnormal growth of skin cells caused by long-term sun exposure. AK is considered to be a precancerous lesion, and is therefore commonly treated to reduce the risk of malignant transformation into skin cancer.

The trial is a randomised, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, dose-comparison trial in which adult subjects with AK grade 1 or 2 will be treated with AVX001 silicone-based gel in doses of 1% or 3% or with a gel vehicle for a 4-week field-directed treatment period. Subjects will be followed up for 8 weeks after the treatment period. The primary objective is to evaluate the local tolerability of daily applications of AVX001 gel in doses of 1% or 3% and compare with vehicle.
