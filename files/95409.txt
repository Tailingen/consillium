Assessing the Response Rate of Neo-adjuvant Taxotere and Trastuzumab in Nigerian Women With Breast Cancer
This is a one stage phase II study with a single arm design. It will be conducted in HER-2 positive breast cancer patients in Nigeria who are chemotherapy/hormonal treatment naive.

DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Herceptin|DRUG: FEC|DRUG: Tamoxifen|DRUG: Letrozole|DRUG: LHRH agonist
Measure the complete pathologic response (pCR), Pathological complete response in the breast is defined as the absence of invasive cells at microscopic examination of the primary tumor and lymph nodes at surgery. Any remaining in-situ lesions are permissible. Participants with invalid/missing pCR assessments will be defined as non-responders., 4-6 months
Number of participants with adverse events, Incidence and severity of adverse drug reactions (AE) and serious adverse drug reactions (SAE) including clinical laboratory values, vital signs, ECGs and dose interruptions., 4-6 months|Time until progression free survival (PFS), From start date of therapy to the date of first documented disease progression or death from any cause, whichever may come first, assessed up to 10 years|Duration of response (DOR), From first reponse to the date of first documented disease progression or death, assessed up to 10 years|Analysis of changes from baseline using the quality of life (QoL) instrument: EORTC, The various domains of QoL over time and the changes from baseline using the validated (by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)) QoL instrument (global and breast module)., From start date of therapy to the date of first documented disease progression or death from any cause, whichever may come first, assessed up to 10 years|Blood concentrations of Herceptin SC given in combination with Docetaxel, Blood concentrations of Herceptin SC at multiple time points using the peak exposure, 21 days|Drug plasma concentration of Herceptin SC given in combination with FEC, Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of Herceptin SC given in combination with FEC following poor response to TH, 21 days|The cardiac toxicity associated with TscH with FEC +scH in breast cancer patients, The percentage of participants with Heart failure (NYHA Class III or IV or as confirmed by a cardiologist) and a decrease in LVEF of at least 10 EF points from baseline and to below 50%., Through study completion an average of two years|The cardiac toxicity associated with TscH without FEC +scH in breast cancer patients, The percentage of participants with Heart failure (NYHA Class III or IV or as confirmed by a cardiologist) and a decrease in LVEF of at least 10 EF points from baseline and to below 50%., Through study completion an average of two years
