Effect of Exercise Training on Angiogenesis and Cachexia in Lung Cancer Patients
Cancer is one of the leading health issues in this country and worldwide. Angiogenesis is an essential process for tumoral growth and metastasis. This process is dependent on the balance between angiogenic factors and antiangiogenic factors. Muscle wasting has been associated with myostatin overexpression in cancer. Exercise training can depress tumor growth and suppress myostatin expression, and enhance skeletal muscle angiogenesis in healthy people and some animal studies. The purpose of this study is mainly to investigate the effects of exercise training on

1. circulating VEGF-A
2. muscle growth and function
3. Myostatin
Non-small-cell Lung Cancer
