A Retrospective Study on Extranodal DLBCL
The aim of this study is to prospectively collect clinical information of patients with extranodal DLBCL, assess the effectiveness of treatment for extranodal DLBCL in the real world, and explore the optimal treatment strategies in real-world populations.

DLBCL is a highly common aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. For specific extranodal sites of DLBCL, traditional chemotherapy protocols often cannot provide satisfactory results for patients. The aim of this study is to prospectively collect clinical information of patients with extranodal DLBCL, including the distribution of involved sites (such as central nervous system, testes, skin, breast, gastrointestinal tract, etc.), prognosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with involvement of different extranodal sites, genetic mutation characteristics, correlation with molecular subtypes, impact of different treatment regimens on efficacy, assess the effectiveness of treatment for extranodal DLBCL in the real world, and explore the optimal treatment strategies in real-world populations.
