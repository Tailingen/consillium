To Evaluate the Safety and Tolerability of SYHX2001 in Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1, open-label, multicenter, dose escalation and expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of the experimental drug(SYHX2001) in previously treated patients with advanced or metastatic cancer.

DRUG: SYHX2001
Dose limiting toxicities (DLT) in stage Ⅰ, Baseline through Day 28|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in stage Ⅰ, Baseline through Day 28|Recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), Baseline through approximately 2 years|Incidence and severity of adverse events in stage Ⅰ, Baseline through approximately 2 years|Overall response rate (ORR) in stage Ⅱ, Up to approximately 2 years
Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) of SYHX2001, Baseline and up to approximately 2 years|Area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) extrapolated from time zero to infinity (AUC[0-inf]) of SYHX2001, up to approximately 2 years|AUC from time zero to the last quantifiable concentration after dosing (AUC[0-t]) of SYHX2001, up to approximately 2 years|Terminal phase half-life (t1/2) of SYHX2001, up to approximately 2 years|Oral clearance (CL/F) of SYHX2001, up to approximately 2 years|PFS Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from first dose until radiographic progression per standard criteria or death due to any cause, whichever is earlier., up to approximately 2 years|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from first evidence of response (complete response or partial response per RECIST 1.1) to earlier date of disease progression or death due to any cause., up to approximately 2 years|Number of patients with any adverse events(AEs) and serious adverse events(SAEs) in stage Ⅱ, up to approximately 2 years|Change from Baseline in symmetrical arginine dimethylation (SDMA) as a pharmacodynamics(PD) measure, Baseline and up to approximately 2 years
This is a multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation, dose-expansion Phase 1 study of SYHX2001(name of the experimental drug) in patients with advanced or metastatic cancers who have exhausted standard treatment. The study will consist of 2 parts, a dose escalation part and a cohort expansion part. Once the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) has been determined in the dose escalation part, a cohort expansion part involving up to three separate cohorts will be conducted. For patients, the study will include a screening phase, a treatment phase, and a post treatment follow-up phase. An end-of-study visit will be conducted within 30 days after the last dose of SYHX2001.
