Depletion of Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells to Enhance Anti PD-1 Therapy
Metastatic non small cell lung cancer can be treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy or using recently approved immunotherapy with antibody, Nivolumab. Both the therapies have limitation due to development of tolerance or immunosuppression. This trial combines one drug from each category, immunotherapeutic Nivolumab and chemotherapeutic gemcitabine as it was reported that gemcitabine reduces immunosuppression by killing myeloid derived suppressor cells, thereby increasing the efficacy of Nivolumab.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer Stage IIIB
BIOLOGICAL: Nivolumab|DRUG: Nivolumab+Gemcitabine
Decrease in Macrophage Derived Suppressor Cells (MDSC) Numbers as a Result of Treatment With Gemcitabine., Immunosuppression in terms of number of circulating MDSC in the blood by comparing within each arm reduction in the number of MDSCs after each cycle of treatment, 2 years
Increase in T-cell Activity, Evaluate if MDSC elimination by gemcitabine results in increase in T-cell activity, 2 years
Primary Objective

â€¢ The primary objective of this proposal is to evaluate gemcitabine as a method of MDSC depletion.

Secondary Objectives

* Evaluate whether these measures result in enhanced T-cell activity and/or NK cell function and number.
* Determine the tolerability and clinical activity (including response rate and survival) of this approach.
* Correlate MDSC number with tumor PD-L1 expression
