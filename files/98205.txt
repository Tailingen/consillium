Adjutant Apalutamide Plus ADT in Post-RP Patients With High Risk of Recurrence (ARES Study)
ARES is a multicenter, single-arm, phase 2 trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ADT in combination with apalutamide as an adjuvant regimen for patients with high risk of recurrence after radical prostatectomy.
Prostate Cancer|Biochemical Recurrence|High Risk
DRUG: Apalutamide 60mg Tab|DRUG: Androgen deprivation therapy(ADT)
Two-year biochemical progression-free survival, It is defined as the proportion of patients without biochemical progression or death 2 year after initiation with Apalutamide plus ADT.

Biochemical progression is defined as an increase of more than 0.5 ng/mL from PSA nadir after treatment (confirmed rise on at least two separate occasions) or any evidence of clinical relapse/metastasis or the initiation of any anti-prostate cancer therapy or death due to any cause., 24 months
Event-free survival rate, It is defined as the proportion of patients without biochemical recurrence or any evidence of clinical relapse/metastasis or initiation of any other anti-prostate cancer therapy or death due to any cause., from initiation with apalutamide up to 36 months|Biochemical progression-free survival, It is defined as the time from the initiation of treatment to the first occurrence of biochemical recurrence, and the definition of biochemical progression is the same as that of the primary observation endpoint;, 60 months|Metastasis-free survival (MFS), It is defined as the time from the start of treatment to the first occurrence of distant metastasis or death, whichever occurs first; distant metastasis can be diagnosed by imaging results or pathology by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR);, 60 months|Quality of life (QoL) assessed by FACT-P scale, The FACT-P scale (39 items) includes a Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G, which consists of 4 subscales measuring physical, functional, social/family, and emotional well-being) and a specific subscale for prostate cancer. The total score is calculated by summing the scores of FACT-G and the prostate cancer subscales, ranging from 0 to 156, with higher scores indicating better functional status, 24 months|Two-year testosterone recovery rate, It is defined as the proportion of patients with testosterone recovery 2 year after initiation of apalutamide plus ADT. Testosterone recovery is defined as testosterone level \>50 ng/dL., 24 months|Time to testosterone recovery, Testosterone recovery is defined as testosterone level \>50 ng/dL, From initiation of apalutamide plus ADT up to 36 months|Number of Adverse Events Number of Adverse Events Number of Adverse Events Adverse events (AEs), All adverse events (AEs) are assessed and graded according to NCI-CTCAE v5.0. Safety will be assessed and documented after the initiation of study drug, regardless of relationship to the study drug, until 30 days after the last study treatment or the initiation of new antineoplastic therapy, whichever occurs first., From initiation of apalutamide plus ADT to 30 days after last dose of apalutamide
