Study of ST-1898 in Locally Advanced or Metastatic Radioiodine-Refractory Differentiated Thyroid Cancer
ST-1898, a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has demonstrated strong inhibitory activity for VEGFR2, c-MET, AXL, PDGFRA, RET, KIT, etc. The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of ST-1898 tablets in patients with locally advanced or metastatic RAIR-DTC after failure of at least first-line TKI systemic therapy. All subjects will receive ST-1898 180 mg orally once daily until disease progression or intolerable toxicity.
Differentiated Thyroid Carcinoma
DRUG: ST-1898 tablets
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of patients who have had a PR or CR as assessed by the RECIST 1.1. (CR: Complete Response, Disappearance of all target lesions, PR: Partial Response, \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions). Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR, Up to 24 months
The number and frequency of treatment-related adverse events (AEs) and treatment related serious adverse events (SAEs), AEs and SAEs will be assessed according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) CTCAE v5.0., Up to 24 months|PFS, Progression-Free Survival (PFS) per RECIST 1.1, Up to 24 months|PFS6m, PFS6m per RECIST 1.1, up to 24 months|DCR, Disease Control Rate (DCR) per RECIST 1.1, up to 24 months|DOR, Duration of Response (DOR) per RECIST 1.1, up to 24 months|OS, Overall Survival (OS) per RECIST 1.1, up to 24 months|Thyroglobulin (Tg), Correlation analysis between Tg and efficacy of ST-1898, Up to 24 months|Thyroglobulin Antibody (TgAb), Correlation analysis between TgAb and efficacy of ST-1898, Up to 24 months|Pharmacokinetic (PK) Parameter: Tmax, Time to Peak Plasma Concentration., On Day 1 from Cycle 1 to Cycle 4 (21 days per cycle), up to 12 weeks|Pharmacokinetic (PK) Parameter: T1/2, Terminal Elimination Half-life., On Day 1 from Cycle 1 to Cycle 4 (21 days per cycle), up to 12 weeks|Pharmacokinetic (PK) Parameter: Cmax, Maximum Plasma Concentration., On Day 1 from Cycle 1 to Cycle 4 (21 days per cycle), up to 12 weeks|Pharmacokinetic (PK) Parameter: AUC, Area Under the Curve of ST-1898 plasma concentration-time curve., On Day 1 from Cycle 1 to Cycle 4 (21 days per cycle), up to 12 weeks
