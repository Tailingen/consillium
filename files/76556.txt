Platform Study of Belantamab Mafodotin as Monotherapy and in Combination With Anti-cancer Treatments in Participants With Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma (RRMM)
B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) is a target present on tumor cells in participants with multiple myeloma. Belantamab mafodotin (GSK2857916); is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) containing humanized anti-BCMA monoclonal antibody (mAb). This is a phase I/II, randomized, open-label, platform study designed to evaluate the effects of belantamab mafodotin in combination with other anti-cancer drugs in participants with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. The Platform design incorporates a single master protocol, where multiple treatment combinations, as sub-studies, will be evaluated simultaneously.
