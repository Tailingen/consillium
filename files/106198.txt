Development of Patient-Reported Outcome Measures Assessing Tumor-Related Disfigurement and Appearance Concerns in Neurofibromatosis Type 1
Background:

Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is a disease that causes tumors to grow along the nerves. These include plexiform neurofibromas (pNF) and cutaneous neurofibromas (cNF). Both pNF and cNF can be visible to other people. These tumors can affect a person s appearance and quality of life. Researchers want to be able to assess changes in appearance before and after treatment for NF1 tumors.

Objective:

To see if two questionnaires can help assess people s ratings about the appearance of their pNF and cNF tumors.

Eligibility:

People aged 8 years and older with pNF and people 12 years and older either with cNF or both pNF and cNF. Adult caregivers of children with pNF and cNF are also needed.

Design:

Participants will complete questionnaires on paper or by phone, computer, or tablet. They will answer questions about how they look, how they feel, and how they feel about the way they look.

Participants will meet in at least 1 remote focus group or individual interview. The meeting will last about 1 hour. Each group will include 3 to 5 people, organized by age: 8 to 11 years, 12 to 17 years, 18 to 29 years, and over 30 years. Adult caregivers will meet in a group with other caregivers.

They will discuss their NF1 symptoms; how their tumors look; how they feel about the way their tumors look; and their daily activities. They will give their opinions about 2 questionnaires about appearance.

The group and individual meetings will be audio-recorded and transcribed. Information that can reveal individual identities will be removed.

Background:

* Individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) may develop plexiform (pNF) and cutaneous (cNF) neurofibroma tumors, both of which can impact one's physical appearance and quality of life.
* To date, there are no validated patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures to assess disfigurement or appearance-related concerns for patients with these tumors.
* The Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis (REiNS) PRO working group, which includes professionals from multiple disciplines and patient representatives, has reviewed disfigurement and appearance concerns measures for potential use in pNF and cNF clinical research trials.
* The group modified existing items to create the Disfigurement Rating Scale for pNF and cNF tumors (DRS-pNF and DRS-cNF).
* Among measures of appearance concerns reviewed by the REiNS PRO group, the FACE-Q was the top candidate for use in NF1 clinical trials but will need to be qualitatively analyzed to confirm its appropriateness. The FACE-Q Craniofacial Module - Appearance Distress Scale consists of 8 items and assesses the psychosocial impact of NF1-tumor-related disfigurement for patients 8 to 29 years of age.

Primary Objective:

-To evaluate newly developed measures of disfigurement (DRS-pNF and DRS-cNF) and select the most appropriate items to assess these constructs in NF1 based on qualitative feedback from children through adults with NF1 and caregivers of pediatric patients to use as endpoints in clinical trials.

Eligibility:

* Age 8+ years for pNF tumors and 12+ years for cNF tumors
* Self-reported diagnosis of NF1 with a pNF and/or cNF tumor(s) or caregiver of a child with NF1 with visible pNF and/or cNF tumor(s)
* Comfortable discussing their medical condition in English
* Access to device with internet

Design:

* This is a qualitative study that seeks to enroll children through adults with pNF and/or cNF tumors and caregivers of a child with these tumors to take part in focus groups and interviews about the domains and measures of interest. These results will inform modifications to the measures.
* A sample size of 90 participants is expected to be sufficient to meet our objectives.
