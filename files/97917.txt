Online Study of Colorectal Cancer and Prostate Cancer Screening Decision Making
Participants will be recruited from the United States and Australia to take an online survey about colon cancer screening or prostate cancer screening. Individuals selected for both the prostate cancer survey and the colon cancer study will be randomized to take one of three survey types - balance sheet, rating and ranking or conjoint analysis. These surveys will help participants clarify their values and opinions about screening options for colon cancer or prostate cancer. Participants' responses to the online survey are measured at one point in time - the time at which the participant takes the survey.

Participant-reported most important attribute from survey, The single most important colon cancer or prostate cancer screening attribute indicated by the participant surveys. Each participant will be randomly assigned to take one of three survey versions: either (1) a conjoint analysis task wherein they will be asked to make a series of choices between hypothetical screening testing strategies with different attributes; (2) a rating and ranking task for these same attributes; or (3) they will make a choice after viewing a balance sheet of attributes., 1 day
Participant-reported intent to undergo screening from survey, the number of participants who state they plan to be screened for condition, 1 day|Unlabeled screening test options, choice on a single question among unlabeled screening test options, 1 day
This study will compare effect of a conjoint analysis based values clarification exercise, ranking and rating, and a balance sheet on screening test preferences for colorectal cancer screening and prostate cancer screening using online surveys. Recruitment will be conducted through Survey Sampling International (SSI), an online survey research firm. Participants will be randomized to one of three arms to take online surveys. Patients will complete either a conjoint analysis task, in which they will be asked to make a series of choices between hypothetical screening testing strategies with different attributes; a rating and ranking task for these same attributes; or they will make a choice after viewing a balance sheet of attributes.
