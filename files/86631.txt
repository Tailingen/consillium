Trial Evaluating MGTA-456 in Patients With High-Risk Malignancy
This is an single arm, open label, interventional phase II trial evaluating the efficacy of umbilical cord blood (UCB) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) expanded in culture with stimulatory cytokines (SCF, Flt-3L, IL-6 and thromopoietin) on lympho-hematopoietic recovery. Patients will receive a uniform myeloablative conditioning and post-transplant immunoprophylaxis.
