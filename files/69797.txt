Imatinib Versus Imatinib and Peg-Interferon in Patients With Ph+ CML and Complete Cytogenetic Response After Imatinib Therapy
The study is controlled and randomized in Philadelphia-positive chronic myeloid leukemia (Ph+ CML) patients with complete cytogenetic response after more than one year of imatinib therapy. The aim is to explore a possible benefit in the addition of peg-interferon (Peg-IFN) to imatinib, in terms of the rate of achievement, molecular remission, and response duration.
