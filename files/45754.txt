A Trial of AK117 (Anti-CD47) in Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome
This is a open label, phase I/II study. All patients are diagnosed with higher-risk MDS, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AK117 + azacitidine in subjects with higher-risk MDS.
