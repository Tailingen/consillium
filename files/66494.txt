Ultrasound-guided Continuous Low Serratus Anterior Plane Block in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Surgery
To investigate the clinical application of ultrasound-guided continuous low serratus anterior plane block in open surgery for hepatocellular carcinoma.
Liver Neoplasms|Postoperative Analgesia|Serratus Anterior Plane Block
PROCEDURE: Ultrasound-guided continuous low serratus anterior plane block|PROCEDURE: Ultrasound-guided single serratus anterior plane block
Block plane, The effect of anesthesia after ultrasound-guided nerve block was measured using planimetry, as well as the area being anesthetized. The chest wall between T2-T9 and ice cotton balls was used to assess the extent and extent of anesthesia block., 30 minute after the surgery begins|visual analogue scale, The visual analogue scale (VAS) of the patient's pain was recorded 24 hours after operation., 24 hours after surgery|visual analogue scale, The visual analogue scale (VAS) of the patient's pain was recorded 48 hours after operation., 48 hours after surgery.|visual analogue scale, The visual analogue scale (VAS) of the patient's pain was recorded 36 hours after operation., 36 hours after surgery.
Patient satisfaction, The patient's satisfaction with the analgesia 2 days after surgery was recorded. The analgesic effect: 1-3 as satisfactory, 4-6 as unsatisfactory, 7-10 as ineffective, 48 hours after surgery.|Remedial analgesic drug, Whether other analgesic drugs were added within 24 hours after operation was recorded, 24 hours after surgery.|Intraoperative blood pressure changes, Blood pressure changes were measured directly by radial artery puncture and recorded.

The changes in blood pressure and heart rate before and after excision and the use of intraoperative opioids., 2 hours after the beginning of surgery.|Intraoperative heart rate changes, The curve of the change of the operative heart rate was recorded through the anesthesia machine., 2 hours after the beginning of surgery.
METHODS: Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who attended our hospital from January 2021 to April 2023 were divided into CS group and N group according to the random number table method; CS group underwent ultrasound-guided continuous low anterior serratus plane block and N group underwent ultrasound-guided single anterior serratus plane block combined with rectus abdominis sheath block; the operation time, anesthesia time, incision length, sensory block time and sensory block maintenance time were counted and recorded. Pain score (NRS) was used to detect analgesia; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), liver function aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and prothrombin time (The time of thrombin, NRS) were measured by fluorescent quantitative PCR. ï¼ˆThe time of thrombin (APTT), total bilirubin (TBIL) levels and adverse reactions.
