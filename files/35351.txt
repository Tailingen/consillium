Pilot Study of Umbilical Cord Blood Transplantation in Adult Patient With Advanced Hematopoietic Malignancies
This is a pilot study designed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of performing umbilical cord blood transplants in adults with high-risk hematopoietic malignancies. A novel myeloablative preparative regimen will be used. One, up to a maximum of three cord blood units will be administered to facilitate engraftment.

This study intends to demonstrate an engraftment rate of \>80% at day 100 post-transplantation and a transplant related mortality rate of \< or equal to 50%. A TRM of \>50% will be considered unacceptable. The present research will also:

* Evaluate the toxicity of busulfan, fludarabine, and etoposide as preparative therapy prior to umbilical cord blood cell transplantation.
* Evaluate neutrophil and platelet recovery following UCB transplantation.
* Evaluate lineage-specific chimerism following transplantation and to assess the contribution of each individual CB unit to post-transplantation hematopoiesis.
* Evaluate event free and overall survival.
* Evaluate the incidence, severity and timing of acute and chronic GVHD following UCB transplantation.
