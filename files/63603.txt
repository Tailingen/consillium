Phase 1/2 Study of BDTX-1535 in Patients With Glioblastoma or Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer With EGFR Mutations
BDTX-1535-101 is an open-label, Phase 1 dose escalation and Phase 2 multiple cohort study designed to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), optimal dosage, central nervous system (CNS) activity, and antitumor activity of BDTX-1535. The study population comprises adults with either advanced/metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with non-classical or acquired epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) resistance (EGFR C797S) mutations with or without CNS disease (in Phase 1 and Phase 2), or glioblastoma (GBM) expressing EGFR alterations (Phase 1 only). All patients will self-administer BDTX-1535 monotherapy by mouth in 21-day cycles.

Phase 1 enrollment is now complete. Phase 2 is currently enrolling.

DRUG: BDTX-1535 monotherapy
Phase 1 Dose Escalation: To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), if one exists, and the preliminary recommended Phase 2 dose(s) (RP2D[s]) of BDTX-1535, Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in Cycle 1, The first treatment 21-day cycle (Cycle 1)|Phase 2: To assess antitumor efficacy of BDTX-1535, Objective response rate (ORR) as assessed by Investigator using RECIST version 1.1, Day 1 every 2 cycles starting on Cycle 3 Day 1 to study completion, approximately 1 year (each cycle is 21 days)
Phase 1 and Phase 2: Incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), Through study completion, approximately 1 year|Phase 1 and Phase 2: To characterize the plasma concentration of BDTX-1535 following single and multiple dosing, Cycle 1 Days 1, 2, 15, and 16, Cycles 2 to 5 Day 1, and Day 1 of every other cycle thereafter to study completion, approximately 1 year (each cycle is 21 days)|Phase 1: To assess the preliminary antitumor activity of BDTX-1535 by objective response as assessed by RECIST version 1.1 (for patients with NSCLC) or Response Assessment in Neuro-oncology (RANO) (for patients with GBM), Day 1 every 2 cycles starting on Cycle 3 Day 1 to study completion, approximately 1 year (each cycle is 21 days)|Phase 1: To assess the effect of tablet formulation on the plasma concentration of BDTX-1535, Two timepoints during the first cycle: Cycle 0 (7 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1) and Cycle 1 Day 1 only (each cycle is 21 days)|Phase 1: To assess the effect of food on the plasma concentration of BDTX-1535, Two timepoints during the first cycle: Cycle 0 (7 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1) and Cycle 1 Day 1 only (each cycle is 21 days)|Phase 2: To assess duration of tumor response by RECIST version 1.1, Day 1 every 2 cycles starting at Cycle 3 Day 1 to study completion, approximately 1 year (each cycle is 21 days)|Phase 2: To assess progression free survival by RECIST version 1.1, Day 1 every 2 cycles starting at Cycle 3 Day 1 to study completion, approximately 1 year (each cycle is 21 days)|Phase 2: To evaluate CNS ORR by RANO for brain metastases criteria (RANO-BM), Day 1 every 2 cycles starting on Cycle 3 Day 1 to study completion, approximately 1 year (each cycle is 21 days)|Phase 2: To assess NSCLC disease-related symptoms and change of symptoms with BDTX-1535 treatment, Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Symptom Assessment Questionnaire (NSCLC-SAQ); Verbal rating scale used (for example: Never/Rarely/Sometimes/Often/Always), At select timepoints: Cycle 1 Day, Cycle 3 Day 1, Cycle 5 Day 1, Cycle 7 Day 1, Cycle 9 Day 1, and at study completion, approximately 1 year (each cycle is 21 days)|Phase 2: To assess treatment related side effects with BDTX-1535, National Cancer Institute Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-PRO-CTCAE) Survey: Rating scale used (for example never/rarely/occasionally/frequently/almost constantly), At select timepoints: Cycle 1 Day, Cycle 3 Day 1, Cycle 5 Day 1, Cycle 7 Day 1, Cycle 9 Day 1, and at study completion, approximately 1 year (each cycle is 21 days)|Phase 2: To determine the optimal dosage of BDTX-1535 (100 mg or 200 mg daily dose), At least the first treatment 21-day cycle (Cycle 1) for select patients enrolled into the Phase 2
