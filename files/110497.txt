Study of the Safety and Effectiveness of GSK6097608 in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
This first-time-in-human (FTIH) study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary clinical activity of escalating doses of GSK6097608 given as monotherapy and in combination with dostarlimab in participants with advanced solid tumors. In addition, dostarlimab will be given as monotherapy (Arm D); and in combination with belrestotug (Arm E); and with GSK6097608 + belrestotug (Arm F) in Japanese and Chinese participants. The study may assess the PK/PD cohorts for Arm E and/or Arm F in participants outside of China and Japan. Additionally, dostarlimab will be given in combination with cobolimab in Japanese participants. Drug name mentioned as belrestotug, GSK4428859A and EOS884448 are interchangeable for the same compound. In the rest of the document, the drug will be referred to as belrestotug.
