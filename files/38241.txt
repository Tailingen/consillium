Protocol for Women at Increased Risk of Developing Breast Cancer
A pilot study to assess the effects of six months of letrozole on breast tissue risk markers in postmenopausal women on hormone replacement therapy at high risk of developing breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: letrozole
Change in Proliferation of Breast Epithelial Cells Obtained by Random Periareolar Fine Needle Aspiration., Proliferation assessment by immunocytochemistry using Ki-67. Expressed as percent of cells staining positive for Ki-67., Baseline, 6 months
A pilot study of letrozole in postmenopausal women on hormone replacement therapy at high risk of developing breast cancer. Subjects will have hyperplasia with atypia (or borderline Epithelial Hyperplasia/Atypical Hyperplasia) and evidence of Estrogen Receptor expression by random periareolar fine needle aspiration and baseline serum estradiol levels less than or equal to 150 pg/ml. The feasibility of performing RT-qPCR on breast specimens for aromatase expression will also be done at baseline.
