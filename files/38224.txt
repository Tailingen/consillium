Prostate Advances in Comparative Evidence
This study is an international multicentre randomised study of low, intermediate, and high risk prostate cancer and is composed of three parallel randomisation schemes based on applicability of surgery as a treatment for the patient and risk group. Low and intermediate risk patients, for whom surgery is a consideration, are randomised to either prostatectomy or prostate SBRT. Low and intermediate risk patients, for whom surgery is not a consideration, are randomised to either conventionally fractionated radiotherapy or prostate SBRT. Intermediate and high risk patients, for whom ADT treatment is indiacted and surgery is not a consideration, are randomised to either conventionally fractionated radiotherapy or prostate SBRT. Efficacy, toxicity and quality of life outcomes will be compared across the pairs in each randomisation.
Prostate Cancer
PROCEDURE: Prostatectomy|RADIATION: Conventionally Fractionated Prostate Radiotherapy|RADIATION: Prostate SBRT
PACE-B and PACE-C: Freedom from biochemical or clinical failure, Biochemical progression is defined as: Phoenix definition

Clinical progression is defined as: commencement (PACE-B) or re-commencement (PACE-C) of androgen deprivation therapy, local recurrence, nodal recurrence and distant metastases, 5 years from randomisation (primary timepoint)|PACE-A: Co-primary patient reported outcomes of urinary incontinence and bowel bother, Urinary incontinence assessed by the number of absorbent pads required per day to control leakage measured by The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index (EPIC) questionnaire.

Bowel bother assessed by summary score from the EPIC questionnaire., 2 years from treatment (primary timepoint)
All arms: Clinician reported acute toxicity, CTCAE and RTOG (SBRT and conventional RT patients) or Clavien scale (surgical patients)., 10 years|All arms: Clinician reported late toxicity, CTCAE and RTOG (SBRT and conventional RT patients only)., 10 years|All arms: Patient reported acute and late bowel, bladder and erectile dysfunction symptoms., Assessed using International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5), International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), Vaizey score, and Expanded Prostate Index Composite-26 (EPIC-26) instruments., 10 years|All arms: Disease-specific and overall survival, Disease-specific and overall survival, 10 years|All arms: Progression-free survival, Radiographic, clinical or biochemical evidence of local or distant failure, 10 years|PACE-A and PACE-B: Commencement of androgen deprivation therapy; PACE-C: Re-commencement of androgen deprivation therapy, LHRH analogues, anti-androgens, orchidectomy, 10 years|PACE-A: Freedom from biochemical or clinical failure, Biochemical progression is defined as: Phoenix definition (SBRT arm) or \>0.2ng/ml (surgical arm)

Clinical progression is defined as: commencement of androgen deprivation therapy, local recurrence, nodal recurrence and distant metastases, 5 years from randomisation (primary timepoint)
