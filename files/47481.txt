A Single-arm, Phase Ⅱ Clinical Trial of Anlotinib Hydrochloride Combined With Irinotecan or Docetaxel for Second Line Treatment of Nonsensitive Relapsed Small-cell Lung Cancer
Anlotinib hydrochloride is a multi-target antiangiogenic drug. It was recommended by Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology(CSCO) guideline as a third-line treatment for advanced small-cell lung cancer. This study intends to assess the efficacy and safety of anlotinib hydrochloride combined with irinotecan or docetaxel for second line treatment of nonsensitive relapsed small-cell lung cancer.
