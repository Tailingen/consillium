Preoperative Smoking Cessation in Patients Undergoing Surgery
Background: At present, effectively implementing smoking cessation programs in the health care system constitutes a major challenge. A unique opportunity to initiate smoking cessation focuses on smokers scheduled for surgery. These patients are not only highly motivated to quit smoking but also likely to benefit from a reduction in postoperative complications which may translate into a decrease of costs. Nevertheless, surgical patients are not routinely informed about the benefits of preoperative smoking cessation. Potential reasons for this missed opportunity may be lack of time and training of surgeons and anesthesiologists. The investigators therefore aim to analyse the impact of a preoperative high-intensity smoking cessation intervention on surgical complications up to a 90-day postoperative period in patients of various surgical disciplines. The hypothesis is that preoperative smoking cessation program improves outcomes in smokers undergoing intermediate to high-risk surgery. The primary objective is to compare complications between patients with an institutional multifaceted smoking cessation intervention starting four weeks before surgery compared to patients in the advice only group (control group) within a 90-day postoperative period. The primary endpoint is the Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI®) within 90 days of surgery. Secondary outcomes include length of hospital stay, cost of hospital stay, smoking abstinence, reduction in nicotine consumption.

Methods: The present study is a single center, randomized trial with two parallel groups of smokers scheduled for surgery comparing surgery alone and surgery with preoperative smoking cessation. The investigators plan to randomize 251 patients. The primary endpoint is the Comprehensive Complication Index up to a 90-day postoperative period. The secondary endpoints include comparison of smoking abstinence, quality of life, mental health, length of stay, costs of care and difference in hospital reimbursement between the two groups.

Discussion: The hypothesis is that preoperative smoking cessation program improves outcomes in smokers undergoing surgery.

Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI), The primary endpoint is the Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI) within 90 days of surgery. The CCI is calculated as the sum of all Clavien-Dindo complications that are weighted for their severity (multiplication of the median preference values from patients and physicians). The final formula yields a continuous scale that ranks the cumulative burden from any combination of complications from 0 to 100 with higher values indicating a higher cumulative burden in a single patient. As a composite complication score, the CCI has the advantage of reflecting the overall burden of the postoperative course that affects the health of patients and their quality of life. In addition, the CCI is a powerful endpoint in trials, as it allows sample size up to nine times lower compared with traditional morbidity endpoints., within a 90 days postoperative time period
