Safety and Effectiveness Study of Docetaxel and ZD1839 Followed by Removal of the Prostate to Treat Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of the combination of docetaxel and ZD1839 on destroying prostate cancer before removal of the prostate.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: docetaxel|DRUG: ZD1839
To evaluate the combination of docetaxel and ZD1839 on pathologic complete response (pCR) in radical prostatectomy specimens. Pathological complete response is defined as no microscopic evidence of neoplastic cells in the resected specimen.
Evaluate the toxicity of docetaxel and ZD1839 in patients with high risk, locally advanced prostate carcinoma prior to surgical resection|Clinical Response|Assessment of margin of positivity at surgical resection|Evaluate PSA response from baseline and post treatment
It is recognized that there is a subset of patients who are at high risk for progression despite aggressive treatment of localized disease at the time of detection. The critical issue is in addressing micrometastatic disease that has already developed prior to diagnosis. This study utilizes daily doses of ZD1839 and weekly docetaxel for two cycles prior to radical prostatectomy.

ZD1839 has demonstrated antiproliferative activity against human tumor xenografts and in coadministration with cytotoxic agents against prostate cell lines (PC-3 and TSU-PRI). The combination of ZD1839 and docetaxel has been reported to be feasible with an acceptable toxicity profile.

This phase II, single center trial is specifically targeting those patients with high-risk adenosarcoma of the prostate.
