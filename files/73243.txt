Title XELOX FOR SALIVARY GLAND CANCERS
The goal of this clinical research study is to find out how effective oxaliplatin and capecitabine are against advanced cancer of the salivary gland. The safety of this treatment as well as how long the cancer responds or stays in a stable state due to the treatment will also be studied.

This is a study of two investigational agents called oxaliplatin and capecitabine.

Investigational agents have not received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the way they are being used in this study. This means an investigation drug is still under study to determine what a safe dose is, what the side effects are and whether or not it is effective in the disease or condition being studied.

Oxaliplatin and capecitabine are chemotherapy agents that have been approved by the FDA for use in other cancers.
