Alpha Radiation Emitters Device for the Treatment of Cutaneous, Mucosal and Superficial Soft Tissue Neoplasia (DaRT)
A unique approach for cancer treatment employing intratumoral diffusing alpha radiation emitter device for superficial cutaneous, mucosal or soft tissue neoplasia
Skin Cancer|Mucosal Neoplasm of Oral Cavity|Soft Tissue Neoplasm
DEVICE: Device: Radiation: Diffusing Alpha Radiation Emitters Therapy (DaRT)
Evaluate the safety of the DaRT treatment, The study primary objective is to evaluate the safety of the DaRT treatment in terms of incidence of device related Serious Adverse Events (SAE)., 5-7 weeks after DaRT seed insertion.
Evaluation the effectiveness of the treatment., Evaluation on the effectiveness of the DaRT treatment, in terms of tumor volume reduction., Tumor volume will be measured during screening, 5 and 30-45 days post DaRT after treatment using CT.
Evaluate the effectiveness of the DaRT treatment, in terms of percent of necrotic, Evaluate the effectiveness of the DaRT treatment, in terms of percent of necrotic tissue present in the remaining tumor tissue surgically removed 15-30 days after removal of DaRT seeds., 15-30 days after removal of DaRT seeds.
This will be a prospective, open label, single arm, controlled study, assessing the safety and efficacy of diffusing alpha emitters radiation therapy (DaRT) delivered through radioactive seeds inserted into the tumor.

This approach combines the advantages of local intratumoral irradiation of the tumor, as used in conventional brachytherapy, with the power of the alpha radiation emitting atoms, that will be introduced in quantities considerably lower than radiation therapy already used in patients.

Superficial lesions with histopathological confirmation of malignancy will be treated using DaRT seeds.

Reduction in tumor volume and evaluation the percent of necrotic tissue in the tumor 30-45 days after DaRT seeds insertion (15-30 days after seed removal) will be assessed. Safety will be assessed by the cumulative incidence, worst severity and frequency of adverse events (AEs) observed including the follow-up period.
