Ate-Bev Early Response Prediction Model in Advanced HCC
The prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma is poor compared to other carcinomas. Many drugs have recently been developed, and recently, atezolizumab-bevacizumab treatment was superior to sorafenib, the conventional treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. However, there is no information on the evaluation on the evaluation of treatment response for atezolizumab-bevacizumab combination therapy compared to atezolizumab alone or bevacizumab alone. Therefore, this study aimed to create a predictive model that can detect treatment response at an early stage.

progression free survival, the index date is the date of treatment with atezolizumab and bevacizumab, and the event is either death or tumor progression of the tumor., the follow up will be continued until June 22th 2025.
Overall survival, the index date is the date of treatment with atezolizumab and bevacizumab, and the event is death., the follow up will be continued until June 22th 2025.
