Endoscopic Ultrasound-guided Needle-based Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy for Diagnosis of Gastric Subepithelial Tumors
The differential diagnosis of gastric subepithelial tumors by endoscopic ultrasound is currently suboptimal. Needle-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (nCLE) is a novel endoscopic technique, which is compatible with the 19-gauge FNA needle. Under endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) guidance, nCLE enables real-time in vivo imaging of lesion tissues at cellular and subcellular levels. This study aimed to describe nCLE interpretation criteria for the characterization of gastric subepithelial tumors, with histopathological correlation, and to perform the validation of these criteria.
