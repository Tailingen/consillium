Preoperative Edema is a Significant Risk Factor for Post-hepatectomy Complications
Aims: The relationship between bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) results and post-hepatectomy complications is unknown. This study aimed to identify the risk factors for post-hepatectomy complications from the BIA results.

Methods: This prospective, observational cohort study reviewed the data of patients who underwent hepatectomy between March 2018 and December 2022. The patients were matched using the following propensity score covariates: biliary enteric anastomosis and major hepatectomy. Risk factors for postoperative complications were investigated in a matched cohort.
