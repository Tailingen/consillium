Bintrafusp Alfa With Chemotherapy for Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor-Resistant EGFR-Mutant Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This phase II trial studies the effect of bintrafusp alfa with pemetrexed and platinum-based chemotherapy (carboplatin or cisplatin) in treating patients with EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer that have spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally advanced) or other places in the body (metastatic) and cannot be removed by surgery, and remains despite treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (Resistant). Immunotherapy with bintrafusp alfa, a bifunctional fusion protein composed of the monoclonal antibody anti-PD-L1 and TGF-beta, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Pemetrexed may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Chemotherapy drugs, such as carboplatin and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving bintrafusp alfa with pemetrexed and platinum-based chemotherapy may help to control the disease.

Best Objective Response Rate (ORR) Within 6 Months, Objective response was assessed by RECIST 1.1. The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started)., Within 6 months since initiation of treatment|Progression Free Survival (PFS) at 18 Weeks, PFS is defined as the date of randomization to the date of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs earlier as per Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 at 18 weeks., 18 weeks
Safety and Tolerability, Safety and tolerability as measured by all adverse events (AEs). Safety and tolerability will be described using frequency of AEs and AEs of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE 5.0). Safety analyses will include all patients who have received at least one dose of study drug and will be evaluated descriptively., Up to 30 days post-treatment|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the date of randomization to the date of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs earlier as per Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) version 1.1., Up to 1 year|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR was defined as the proportion of patients who had an overall response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD). According to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST) Version 1.1, Up to 1 year|Duration of Response (DoR), The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, or death due to any cause. Participants without events reported are censored at the last disease evaluation), Up to 1 year|Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from treatment to death due to any cause, or censored at date last known alive., Up to 1 year
