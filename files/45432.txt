Active Surveillance of Papillary Thyroid Microcarcinoma
Papillary thyroid microcarcinoma are small thyroid cancer measuring 1cm or less. Most of this tumor are not palpable and are identified either through pathologic examination or from imaging modalities, such as CT scan or thyroid sono. Active surveillance of papillary microcarcinoma is to observe thyroid papillary cancer without immediate surgical approach. The purpose of this study is to understand more about the characteristics of papillary microcarcinoma, which has been known for "the cancer slowly progression"
