Bevacizumab With Abraxane in Patients With Recurrent Ovarian/ Peritoneal Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of the combination of bevacizumab and Abraxane in the treatment of women with epithelial ovarian cancer or peritoneal cancer. The study will also evaluate how the patient's quality of life is during their treatment.
Epithelial Ovarian Cancer|Primary Peritoneal Carcinoma
DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Abraxane
6-month Progression-Free Rate, Progression-free rate is defined as the percentage of participants with no progression event at 6 months after starting study treatment. An event for this endpoint was defined as a progression-free survival event occurring earlier than six months, or discontinuation of treatment earlier than six months for any other reason. Progression is defined per RECIST criteria v1.0 as a measurable increase in the smallest diameter of any target lesion, progression of existing non-target lesions, or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions., 6 months after initiation of study treatment
Best Overall Response, Radiologic imaging was scheduled to be performed at baseline, after every third treatment cycle, and at the end of treatment or time of progression unless it was done in the previous four weeks. Response was evaluated using RECIST version 1.0 guidelines, where complete response (CR) is the disappearance of all target lesions; partial response (PR) is \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; overall response (OR) = CR+PR., Radiologic imaging was repeated after every 3 cycles (about every 12 weeks) during study treatment, up to 31 months.|Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from treatment start until death from any cause, assessed up to 40 months.|Progression-free Survival (PFS), Disease progression was determined through radiology imaging measurements and by clinical or symptomatic progression during or after treatment. Progression is defined per RECIST criteria v1.0 as a measurable increase in the smallest diameter of any target lesion, progression of existing non-target lesions, or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions., PFS was measured from day 1 of treatment until time of progression (assessed every 12 weeks) or death, whichever came first, assessed up to 30 months.|Best Overall Response at Six Months, The outcome measure assessed the percentage of participants who had achieved either a Partial or Complete Response over 6 months of treatment. Radiologic imaging was scheduled to be performed at baseline, after every third treatment cycle, and at the end of treatment or time of progression unless it was done in the previous four weeks. Response was evaluated using RECIST version 1.0 guidelines, where complete response (CR) is the disappearance of all target lesions; partial response (PR) is \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; overall response (OR) = CR+PR., Assessed over 6 months of study treatment
