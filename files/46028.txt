LMB-2 to Treat Hairy Cell Leukemia
Background:

* About 80% of patients with hairy cell leukemia (HCL) have tumor cells that have a protein on their surface called cluster of differentiation 25 (CD25).
* The experimental drug LMB-2 is a recombinant immunotoxin that has been shown to kill leukemia and lymphoma cells with the CD25 protein. (A recombinant immunotoxin is a genetically engineered drug that has two parts - a protein that binds or targets a cancer cell, and a toxin that kills the cancer cell to which it binds.)

Objectives:

* To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of LMB-2 in patients with HCL whose cancer cells contain the CD25 protein.
* To evaluate the effects of LMB-2 on the immune system, determine how the drug is metabolized by the body and examine its side effects.

Eligibility:

-Adults with hairy cell leukemia whose tumor cells have CD25 on their surface

Design:

* Up to 27 patients may be included in the study.
* Patients receive an infusion of LMB-2 through a vein every other day for three doses (days 1, 3, 5), constituting one treatment cycle.
* Patients may receive up to six treatment cycles every 4 weeks unless their cancer worsens or they develop unacceptable side effects.
* Blood is drawn weekly for various tests.
* Before each cycle and in follow-up visits, disease status is evaluated with a physical examination, blood tests, chest x-ray and electrocardiogram.
* Before the first cycle, patients may have a computed tomography (CT) scan, echocardiogram (heart ultrasound test) and bone marrow biopsy. With the patient's permission, these tests may be repeated before other cycles also.

DRUG: Anti-Tac(Fv)-PE38 (LMB-2) Immunotoxin
Number of Patients Who Obtain Partial Response/Complete Remission, Partial response requires all of the following for a period of at least 4 weeks: ≥50% decrease in hairy cell count from pretreatment baseline value by flow cytometry. ≥50% reduction in abnormal hepatosplenomegaly by computed tomography or physical exam. No growth in lymphadenopathy. Neutrophils ≥1,500/µL or 50% improvement over baseline without growth factors for at least 4 weeks. Platelets ≥100,000/µL or 50% improvement over baseline. Complete remission requires all of the following: no evidence of leukemic cells by routine hematoxylin and eosin stains of the peripheral blood and bone marrow. No hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, or lymphadenopathy (not \>2 cm in short axis) by physical examination and appropriate radiographic techniques. Normal complete blood count as exhibited by Neutrophils ≥1,500/µL, Platelets ≥100,000/µL, and Hemoglobin ≥11.0g/dL without transfusions or growth factors for at least 4 weeks., 6 months
Duration of Response, Duration of response is the duration that the patients qualifies for at least a Partial Response (PR). Partial response requires all of the following for a period of at least 4 weeks: ≥50% decrease in hairy cell count from pretreatment baseline value by flow cytometry. ≥50% reduction in abnormal hepatosplenomegaly by computed tomography or physical exam. No growth in lymphadenopathy. Neutrophils ≥1,500/µL or 50% improvement over baseline without growth factors for at least 4 weeks. Platelets ≥100,000/µL or 50% improvement over baseline. Hemoglobin ≥11.0 g/dL or 50% improvement over baseline without transfusions or growth factors for at least 4 weeks., Participants were assessed at 5.0658, 12.0066, 20.1645, 26.9079, 35.0987, and 45.1316 months|Number of Participants With Serious and Non-serious Adverse Events Assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria in Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.0), Here is the count of participants with serious and non-serious adverse events assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria in Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.0). A non-serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence. A serious adverse event is an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that results in death, a life threatening adverse drug experience, hospitalization, disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, congenital anomaly/birth defect or important medical events that jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the previous outcomes mentioned., Date treatment consent signed to date off study, approximately 83 months and 15 days.
Background: About 80% of patients with hairy cell leukemia (HCL) have malignant cells that express cluster of differentiation 25 (CD25) (Tac or Interleukin-2 receptor alpha (IL2Ra)). Normal resting B- and T-cells do not express CD25. LMB-2 is an anti-CD25 recombinant immunotoxin containing variable domains of MAb anti-Tac and truncated Pseudomonas exotoxin. A phase I trial at National Cancer Institute (NCI) found that the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of LMB-2 was 40 microg/Kg intravenous (IV) given every other day for 3 doses (QOD x3). The most common adverse events were transient fever, hypoalbuminemia and transaminase elevations. In that trial, 4 of 4 patients with chemoresistant HCL had major responses, including one complete (CR) and 3 partial remissions. The patient with CR entered the trial transfusion dependent and now still has normal hemoglobin and platelet counts over 7 years later. Because HCL is more frequently cluster of differentiation 22 (CD22+) than CD25+ (100 vs 80%), HCL patients were subsequently treated with the anti-CD22 recombinant immunotoxin BL22 and no further HCL patients were treated with LMB-2. BL22 has induced 25 CRs out of 51 evaluable HCL patients. LMB-2 may be useful in patients incompletely responding to BL22, because it may distribute more evenly through extravascular sites of disease. Moreover, BL22 but not LMB-2 has caused hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) in 7 patients, 6 with HCL, and several of these patients could benefit by LMB-2. Thus, LMB-2 may be a useful and potentially lifesaving agent in patients who are unable to receive or who have not responded adequately to BL22.

Objectives: The purpose of this study is to determine the activity of anti-Tac(Fv)-PE38 (LMB-2) in patients with CD25-expressing hairy cell leukemia (HCL). The primary endpoint of this trial is response rate. We will also evaluate response duration, LMB-2 immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and monitor soluble Tac levels in the serum.

Eligibility: Patients must have CD25+ HCL cells by flow cytometry, cytopenia or high circulating HCL count, prior treatment with or inability to receive BL22, prior treatment with cladribine, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) 0-2, at least 18 years old, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) grade 0-2, albumin grade 0-1, bilirubin less than or equal to 2.2, creatinine less than or equal to 1.4 or creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 50, lack of high levels of neutralizing antibodies, lack of anti-CD25 Mab therapy for 12 weeks and other systemic treatment for 4 weeks, no prior treatment with LMB-2, lack of other uncontrolled illness including 2nd malignancy, no human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis C positivity, no coumadin therapy, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) greater than or equal to 45%, diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) greater than or equal to 55%, and forced expiratory volume 1 (FEV1) greater than or equal to 60%.

Design: Patients will receive LMB-2 at 40 microg/Kg every other day (QOD) x3 at intervals of at least 25 days for up to 6 cycles. Retreatment is permitted in the absence of neutralizing antibodies or progressive disease. Patients in CR may receive 2 consolidation cycles, or 4 consolidation cycles if CR is with minimal residual disease.

Dose level: LMB-2 40 microg/Kg QOD x3

Expected Accrual: 5-10 patients/year, total of 25 patients
