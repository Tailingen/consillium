Radiofrequency Ablation Combined With S-1 for Pancreatic Cancer With Liver Metastasis
This study aims to explore the efficacy and safety of radiofrequency ablation combined with S-1 in pancreatic cancer patients with liver metastasis, as well as the correlation of serum microRNA and patients' prognosis. This protocol will be overseen by the Fudan University Institutional Review Board which has Federal Wide Assurance through the U.S. Department of Health \& Human Services (Approved: April 25, 2002).
Carcinoma, Pancreatic
PROCEDURE: radiofrequency ablation|DRUG: S-1
Overall survival, From date of randomization until the date of death, assessed up to 100 months.
Progression free survival, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months.
Primary Outcome Measures:

To evaluate the overall survival (OS) in pancreatic cancer patients with liver metastasis treated with radiofrequency ablation combined with S-1.

Secondary Outcome Measures:

1. To explore the correlation of OS and serum microRNA of the patients.
2. To evaluate the progression free survival (PFS) and its correlation with serum microRNA.
3. To observe the objective response rate (ORR) and adverse effects of the treatment.
