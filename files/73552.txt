Minimally Invasive Liver Surgery for Metastases From Colorectal Cancer: Oncologic Outcome and Prognostic Factors
Only few reports exist on long-term survival after minimally invasive liver surgery (MILS for colorectal liver metastases. No data are available assessing prognostic factors in the era of current modern treatment strategies. The aim of the current study is to analyze the long-term oncologic outcome after MILS for metastases from colorectal cancer and determine prognostic indicators.
