Observational Study Towards the Impact of Newly Started Treatment in MDS on QoL
Study type An observational study conducted in different hematological centers in Belgium.

Study objectives

Primary objective:

To assess the impact of newly started treatments on the QOL of patients suffering from myelodysplastic syndromes.

Secondary objectives:

* To assess the impact of newly started therapy on disease perception in MDS patients
* To study the relation between disease perception and quality of life
* To examine which clinical and disease specific factors determine QOL in MDS patients
* Collect information on the transfusion threshold in Belgian hematological centers and evaluate the impact on quality of life.
* To evaluate whether changes in QOL are related to hematological respons.

Study design

* Newly diagnosed MDS patients who are about to start a treatment or previously diagnosed MDS patients who are starting with a new line of therapy.
* QOL assessment with the QUALMS.
* Disease perception measurement using the B-IPQ.
* Measurement at diagnosis/before start of therapy, at 4 weeks, 12 weeks, and at 24 weeks into treatment.

Study endpoints

Primary endpoint:

Change in QUALMS score at visit timepoints 4 - 12 - 24 weeks after the start of a new treatment.

Secondary endpoint:

* Change in B-IPQ score at visit timepoints 4 - 12 - 24 weeks after the start of a new treatment
* Association between B-IPQ and QUALMS score.
* Association between clinical and disease specific factors and QUALMS score
* Association between transfusion threshold and QUALMS score.
* Association between hematological response and QUALMS score

Summary of eligibility criteria

* Adult patients with a new diagnosis of MDS (according to WHO 2016 definitions (3) or known patients with MDS who are about to start a new treatment.
* Signed informed consent.
* Patients enrolled in an unblinded interventional therapeutic trial are eligible.

Exclusion criteria

* Patients with acute leukemia defined as \>20% bone marrow blasts.
* Patients suffering from an overlap syndrome myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disease.
* Patients in post allogeneic transplant setting.
* Patients enrolled in a blinded interventional therapeutic trial.
* Patients starting with multiple treatments under investigation at the same moment apart from intensive chemotherapy.
* Newly diagnosed patients who do not start with treatment.
* Patients who started a previous treatment less then 12 weeks ago apart from packed cell transfusion (up to 4 weeks allowed).
* Diagnosis of any previous or concomitant malignancy except when the patient successfully completed treatment (chemotherapy and/or surgery and/or radiotherapy) with curative intent for this malignancy at least 3 months prior to inclusion.
* Patients refusing to sign informed consent.
