Hypofractionated Boost vs Conventionally Fractionated Boost for Localized High Risk Prostate Cancer
Randomized trial comparing 2 external beam radiotherapy fractionation schemes in patients with localized high risk prostate cancer. Primary endpoint is acute toxicity.
Prostate Cancer
RADIATION: Conventionally Fractionated versus Hypofractionated Boost
Acute Toxicity, Proportion of patients experiencing grade \>=2 acute toxicity, within 3 months after starting radiotherapy
Late Toxicity, Proportion of patients experiencing grade \>= 2 late toxicity, beyond 3 months of starting radiotherapy|Biochemical Control (Phoenix Definition), Actuarial measure of patients failing biochemically (defined as PSA nadir + 2 ng/mL), at 5 years|Overall Survival, Actuarial measure of patients being alive, at 5 years
Patients enrolled onto this study will be randomized to one of the following treatment arms:

* Standard fractionation: Using 2 sequential IMRT plans, the pelvic lymph nodes and prostate will initially be treated to 46 Gy in 23 fractions, followed by a subsequent boost to the prostate to a total dose of 78 Gy.
* Hypofractionation: Using a one phase IMRT plan, the pelvic lymph nodes will be treated to a dose of 48 Gy in 25 fractions, while the prostate will be treated to a dose of 68 Gy in 25 fractions concomitantly (simulataneous integrated boost).

In addition, all patients receive 1.5- 3 years of androgen deprivation therapy.
