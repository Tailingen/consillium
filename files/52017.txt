BGJ398 in Combination With Imatinib Mesylate in Patients With Untreated Advanced Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST)
The goal of a phase Ib clinical trial is to find the doses of drugs that are safe. Although BGJ398 has been given to patients safely on its own, it has never been given together with imatinib mesylate. In this study, we will test the safety of taking BGJ398 with imatinib mesylate. The investigators will learn this by closely checking for side effects that the patient may experience. Side effects can be seen in laboratory studies, on physical examination, or by asking the patient.Once a dose has been determined to be safe, a larger Phase II study will be done in patients with advanced GIST who have never received any prior treatments.
Advanced Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST)
DRUG: BGJ398|DRUG: Imatinib Mesylate
Phase Ib Study: Number of Participants With Dose-Limiting Toxicities, The phase Ib will be pursued in standard 3+3 format, based on toxicities encountered during the first cycle of therapy., 1 year|Phase Ib Portion: Response Rate (RR), (CR+PR, RECIST 1.1) and by CHOI criteria

PHASE 1b PARTICIPANTS ONLY

Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR, 32 weeks
Phase Ib Study: Response Rate (RR), defined by RECIST 1.1 criteria and by CHOI criteria,and by EORTC criteria
