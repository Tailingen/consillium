Study of XNW28012 in Subjects with Advanced Solid Tumors Who Failed Standard Treatments
This is an open-label, dose escalation, multicenter, phase 1, first-in-human study of XNW28012 in subjects with advanced solid tumors who have failed current standard anti-tumor therapies or are intolerant to such therapies. The study consists of two parts: a dose escalation part and a dose expansion part.
