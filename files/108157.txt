A Trial Assessing Chemo Mouthpiece Device With Best Supportive Care for Symptoms of Chemotherapy-Induced Oral Mucositis
This study will compare the use of the Chemo MouthpieceTM device along with best supportive oral care to best supportive oral care alone to rate the effectiveness of Chemo MouthpieceTM in lessening symptoms associated with chemotherapy regimen known to place patients at risk for symptomatic mucositis and, of those, chemotherapy regimens for which ice-based cryotherapy has been demonstrated to have a favorable impact on oral mucositis symptom management. Subjects who are receiving standard chemotherapy regimens will be randomly assigned to receive either study device and oral care ingredients or oral care ingredients only. All subjects will complete daily diaries for the first 14 days of chemotherapy Cycles 1 and 2. Subjects who are assigned to the study device arm will use the device during their chemotherapy infusion in clinic and will continue to use the device at home ,at least twice daily, for the first six (6) days of chemotherapy Cycles 1 and 2. Prior to the first chemotherapy infusion in Cycle 3, all subjects in the study regardless of treatment assignment will have the option of using the Chemo MouthpieceTM for subsequent cycles.
