To Assess the Safety and Efficacy of SP-002 with Vismodegib for the Treatment of Locally Advanced Basal Cell Carcinoma
The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy of using SP-002 in participants with locally advanced Basal cell carcinoma. The main question it aims to answer is what the objective response rate for a basal cell carcinoma tumor is following 1 or 3 cycles of SP-002 treatment given as an add-on to hedgehog pathway inhibitor therapy.

Researchers will compare the objective response rate for treated Basal cell carcinoma tumors between 3 treatment Arms.

* Arm 1 participants will receive daily hedgehog pathway inhibitor, and 3 cycles of SP-002 treatment.
* Arm 2 participants will receive daily hedgehog pathway inhibitor, and 1 cycle of SP-002 treatment.
* Arm 3 participants will receive daily hedgehog pathway inhibitor only.
Basal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: SP-002|DRUG: Vismodegib
Objective response rate, ORR defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) of the target lesion based on central review at any time point., Week 26
Duration of response, DOR defined as the time interval between the date of first response (CR or PR) of the target lesion to the date of disease progression or death from any cause. Disease progression as assessed by central review., Month 36|Progressive free survival, PFS defined as the time interval between the date of randomization/start of treatment to the date of first documented progression of the target tumor or death. If a subject has not had an event, PFS is censored at the date of last adequate tumor assessment. Rate of disease progression of the target tumor as assessed by central review., Month 36|Overall survival (OS), OS defined as the time interval between the date of randomization and the date of death. If a subject has not had an event, the patient will be censored at the date of the last study visit attended., Month 36|Objective Response Rate (ORR) / Complete Response (CR) / Partial Response (PR), ORR/CR/PR by investigator assessment (color photography/imaging \[RECIST-measurable\])., Month 36|Number of subjects discontinuing treatment with SP-002 and/or vismodegib due to toxicity., Safety of Participants, Month 36|Number of subjects with delays to SP-002 and/or vismodegib dosing due to toxicity., Safety of Participants, Month 36|Incidence and severity of SP-002 and/or vismodegib related AEs., Safety of Participants, Month 36
This is a Phase 2, 3-arm, multi-center, open-label, randomized, clinical study to evaluate the efficacy of SP-002 in combination with vismodegib in subjects with locally advanced Basal cell carcinoma.

The study will be completed in 2 consecutive parts. Each part consists of a screening period, a treatment period, and a follow-up period.

* Part A: 20 participants who meet study entry criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into 2 treatment arms (Arm 2 and Arm 3) and will provide preliminary safety and performance in a population with target Basal cell carcinoma lesions.
* Part B: 60 participants who meet study entry criteria will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio into 3 treatment arms (Arm 1, Arm 2, and Arm 3) in a population with target Basal cell carcinoma lesions.
