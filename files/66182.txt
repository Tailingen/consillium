Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Locally Advanced Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to analyze gene expression signature and immunohistochemical markers associated with clinical and pathological response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: doxorubicin|DRUG: cyclophosphamide|DRUG: paclitaxel|PROCEDURE: Surgery
Clinical objective and pathological responses to chemotherapy, Clinical and radiological examinations to be performed before chemotherapy, after the 4 cycle of AC and before surgery.

Pathologic evaluation to be performed 30 days after the last cycle of chemotherapy, i.g. after surgery., 8 months
Clinical, radiologic and pathologic correlation, tumor concordance measurement among pre-operative physical examination (PE), mammography (MG), ultrasound (US), breast MRI and post-operative pathologic measurement concordance with PE, MG, US and MRI, 3 years|Surgery, The use and security of oncoplastic surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 5 years|Overall actuarial survival, 5 years|Pathologic complete response, Pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 9 months
Locally advanced breast cancer is a common condition in development countries. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy gives the opportunity to identify genetic signatures associated with objective clinical and pathological complete responses.

Patients will receive doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide with paclitaxel. Tumor samples collected before and after chemotherapy will be analyzed.
