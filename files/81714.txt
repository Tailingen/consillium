Study to Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of TJ107 Combine With PD-1 in Patients With Solid Tumors
Study Purpose and Design:A Multicenter, Open-label, Exploratory Phase II Clinical Study to Evaluate the Safety and Tolerability and Preliminary Efficacy of TJ107 in Combination with Pembrolizumab Injection in Patients with Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
Triple-negative Breast Cancer|Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma

This open-label, multicenter phase 2 study will enroll 28 to 39 subjects in each of the following 4 cohorts Cohort 1 Triple-negative breast cancer Cohort 2 Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma Cohort 3 Other tumor species (to be determined) Cohort 4 Other tumor species (to be determined) The trial consists of two phases, the first is a safety run-in phase and the second is a case extension phase.

In the safety run-in phase, 3 subjects will be treated with TJ107 (1200 µg/kg q12w) combined with Pembrolizumab Injection (200 mg q3w) first. A safety assessment was conducted by a safety assessment committee composed of the sponsor and the investigator on the first dose in these 3 subjects to determine that the dose of TJ107 1200 µg/kg was safe and to determine whether to continue the safety assessment in these 3 patients, either at this dose level, or at a dose or dosing interval adjustment (e.g., the dose of TJ107 was adjusted to 960 ug/kg or the dosing interval was adjusted).

In the case expansion phase, 28-39 subjects will be enrolled in each cohort, and TJ107 (1200 µg/kg q12w) combined with Pembrolizumab Injection (200 mg q3w) or TJ107 adjusted dose combined with Pembrolizumab Injection (200 mg q3w) will be administered until intolerance or disease progression and other endpoint events occur.
