This study is aimed at recurrent/metastatic/resectable patients who have received systemic chemotherapy of 2nd line or less. Excludes previously diagnosed mucinous tumors of gastrointestinal origin through upper and lower endoscopy and pathologic immunohistochemical staining.

Bevacizumab plus modified FOLFIRINOX drug is administered every 2 weeks. To prevent neutropenia fever during chemotherapy, pegteograstim is given 24 hours after chemotherapy.

The primary objective of this study is the objective response rate (ORR). The secondary objectives are progression-free survival (PFS) and disease control rate at 6 months after administration, disease control rate (DCR), overall survival (OS), drug safety, and quality of life improvement as assessed by patient questionnaires.

In addition, the investigators intend to explore biomarkers that can predict the effect of bevacizumab + mFOLFIRINOX combination therapy through the collection of tumor samples and blood samples for exploratory purposes.
