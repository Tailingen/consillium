Re-expression of ER in Triple Negative Breast Cancers
Patients are being asked to take part in this study because they have metastatic breast cancer that is triple negative (does not express estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) or HER2). This means that agents such as trastuzumab (Herceptin®) and tamoxifen are not currently treatment options for their cancer. Another option for treating the patient's cancer at this point is with chemotherapy. The patient should discuss this and other options with their doctor prior to entering this study.

Laboratory studies have demonstrated that ER is actually present in some triple negative breast cancers but is "silenced" (does not function properly) because methyl and histone groups are attached to it and inactivate it. Special drugs called demethylating inhibitors (such as decitabine) and histone deacetylase inhibitors (such as LBH589) can remove these methyl and histone groups and reactivate ER. This reactivated ER can then be targeted with agents like tamoxifen.

The patient is being asked to join this clinical research study to find out if ER can be reactivated in their cancer using decitabine in combination with LBH589. If ER is reactivated in their cancer, we will then determine if tamoxifen can decrease the growth of the cancer.

DRUG: Decitabine, LBH589, Tamoxifen
To Determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose of Decitabine and LBH589 Given in Combination in Patients With Metastatic or Locally Advanced Metastatic Breast Cancers, Estrogen receptor status checked 5 days after treatment. Staging is done every 8 weeks.
To Determine the Safety of Tamoxifen in Combination With Decitabine and LBH589, Patients will undergo an evaluation for extent of disease 8 weeks from starting study drugs and every 8 weeks (2 cycles) while on study.
