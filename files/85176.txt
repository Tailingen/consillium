Venetoclax and Azacitidine for the Management of Molecular Relapse/Progression in Adult NPM1-mutated Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This is a phase 2, non-randomized, interventional, open-label, multicenter trial evaluating the efficacy of VEN-AZA as a bridge-to-transplant therapy in chemotherapy-treated adult NPM1mut AML patients who experience molecular relapse or progression during treatment or follow-up. Subjects will receive cycles of venetoclax plus azacitidine. After each cycle, MRD will be evaluated and at any time of MRD-negativity, AlloSCT will be performed.

This is a phase 2, non-randomized, interventional, open-label, multicenter trial evaluating the efficacy of VEN-AZA as a bridge-to-transplant therapy in chemotherapy-treated adult NPM1mut AML patients who experience molecular relapse or progression during treatment or follow-up.

Subjects will receive venetoclax 400 mg orally QD on Days 1 - 28 plus azacitidine 75 mg/m2 SC or IV daily for 7 days. Cycle Length: 28 Days.

Subjects will continue treatment until subsequent alloSCT, documented morphological bone marrow and/or extramedullary disease progression, toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or the subject meets other protocol criteria for discontinuation (whichever occurs first).

After each cycle, MRD will be evaluated. AlloSCT is recommended at any time of MRD-negativity. After 6 cycles of treatment, regardless MRD status, patients will proceed to alloSCT.
