DRUG: Ofatumumab|DRUG: Lenalidomide
Overall Response Rate, Obtain early assessment of the efficacy of the intracycle sequential administration of ofatumumab and lenalidomide in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) after prior use of rituximab. Response was categorized according to the IW-CLL criteria which includes the following: Complete remission (CR), CR with incomplete marrow recovery (CRi)Partial remission (PR), Progressive disease (PD), Stable disease (SD).

Overall response rate was defined as those who experienced a response of CR, CRi or PR., 30 Weeks
Frequency of Adverse and Severe Adverse Events, Frequency of adverse and severe adverse events, 30 weeks|Biomarkers Changes During Treatment., Biomarkers changes during treatment. A minimum of 5 subjects will be enrolled in the biomarkers sub-study. Only those subjects enrolled at MUSC will be considered for the biomarkers sub-study. At day 1 of cycle 1, day 8 of cycle 1, day 1 of cycle 2 and day 8 of cycles 2, blood samples will be obtained for assessment of biomarkers., 30 Weeks|Frequency of Adverse Events, Number of adverse events occuring in greater than 20% of subjects, 30 weeks|Dose Reductions Due to Adverse Events., Number of dose reductions due to toxicity., 30 weeks
