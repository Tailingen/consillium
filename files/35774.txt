A Study of VRd-based Regimen Combined With CART-ASCT-CART2 Treatment in NDMM Patients With P53 Abnormalities
This is a single-arm, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of VRD(Bortezomib, Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone)-based regimen combined with CART-ASCT-CART2 in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma with p53 gene abnormalities.

The study is a prospective, single-arm, single-centre, phase II study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment with the VRd (short for Bortezomib, Lenalidomide, Dexamethasone)-based regimen in combination with the CART-ASCT-CART2 in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients with P53 gene abnormalities. Patients received 3 courses of induction therapy with VRd-based regimen followed by a first infusion of CAR-T cells. Patients then received 3 courses of consolidation therapy, followed by ASCT and second infusion of CAR-T cells. R maintenance therapy starts on day 100 after ASCT
