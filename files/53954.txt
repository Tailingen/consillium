Study of Abexinostat in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Follicular Lymphoma
This study in patients with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma who have undergone at least 3 lines of therapy. Patients will receive abexinostat 80 mg (4 × 20 mg tablets) twice a day (BID) in a "one week on, one week off" schedule.
Follicular Lymphoma
DRUG: Abexinostat
Clinical effect of abexinostat, Complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to the Lugano 2014 criteria as determined by an Independent Review Committee (IRC)., Time frame up to 100 months
Duration of response, Duration of response defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until disease progression or death from any cause among patients who achieve an objective response, according to the Lugano 2014 criteria as determined by an IRC., At the end of cycle 2 (each cycle is 28 days) and through study completion, assessed up to 100 months.|Progression free survival, Defined as the time from the start of treatment until disease progression or death assessed using the Lugano 2014 criteria as determined by an IRC., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever comes first, assessed up to 100 months|Clinical Benefit, Defined as the best from CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) according to the Lugano 2014 criteria as determined by an IRC., At the end of cycle 2 (each cycle is 28 days) and through study completion, assessed up to 100 months.|Overall survival, Defined as the time from the start of treatment until death from any cause or last contact., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever comes first, assessed up to 100 months|Duration of response, Defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR from any cause among patients who achieve an objective response, according to the RECIL 2017 as determined by an IRC. Duration of response will be evaluated once more using the RECIL 2017 with the inclusion of Minor Response (MR) lasting ≥ 6 months., At the end of cycle 2 (each cycle is 28 days) or from date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever comes first, assessed up to 100 months|Incidence of adverse events, Safety as measured by the incidence of adverse events, At the end of cycle 2 (each cycle is 28 days) or from date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever comes first, assessed up to 100 months|Incidence of serious adverse events, Safety as measured by the serious of adverse events (SAE), At the end of cycle 2 (each cycle is 28 days) or from date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever comes first, assessed up to 100 months|Incidence of non-serious adverse events, Safety as measured by the non-serious of adverse events, At the end of cycle 2 (each cycle is 28 days) or from date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever comes first, assessed up to 100 months|Change in the interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) interval, Change from baseline in the QTc interval., At the end of cycle 2 (each cycle is 28 days) or from date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever comes first, assessed up to 100 months
Patients will be evaluated for objective response, Duration of Response (DOR), Progression Free Survival (PFS), Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), Overall survival (OS), safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), and changes in health related quality of life. Patients may receive treatment until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. An independent data safety monitoring committee (iDMC) will evaluate the data pertaining to the futility and decide whether the study should stop or continue to the second stage. If the study continues to the second stage, a total of 139 patients will be studied.
