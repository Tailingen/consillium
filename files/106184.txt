Gynaecological Follow-up of a Subset of HPV-015 (NCT00294047) Study Subjects
This study is intended to provide up to a maximum of four years of annual oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing and cervical cytology examination for NCT00294047 study subjects who displayed normal cervical cytology but tested positive for oncogenic HPV infection at their concluding NCT00294047 study visit.

Women who were pregnant at their concluding NCT00294047 study visit may also be included in this study, as no cervical sample could be collected at that visit.

The objectives and outcome measures of the primary phase (NCT00294047) are presented in a separate protocol posting.
