A Study Evaluating Safety and Pharmacokinetics of FPA144 in Japanese Patients With Advanced Gastric or Gastroesophageal Cancer
The main objectives of this study are:

* To determine the recommended dose (RD) of FPA144 in participants with gastric or gastroesophageal cancer (hereafter referred to as gastric cancer)
* To evaluate the safety of escalating doses of FPA144 in participants with gastric cancer
* To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of single and multiple doses of intravenously administered FPA144 in participants with gastric cancer
Gastric or Gastroesophageal Cancer
DRUG: FPA144
Number of Participants who Experience Grade 3 or Grade 4 Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs), DLTs are defined as specific adverse events (AEs) or clinically laboratory abnormalities that occur during the DLT observation period (Day 1 to Day 28 of Cycle 1; cycle = 28 days), that the Cohort Review Committee (CRC) assess as related to FPA144. Events will be graded using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03:

* Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but non-immediately life threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-care activities of daily living; severe AE
* Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated, Day 1 to Day 28 of Cycle 1|Area Under Serum Concentration-time Curve (AUC) of FPA144, Cycle 1: Pre-dose (within 4 hours prior to infusion on Day 1) and 0.5, 3, 6, 24, 72, and 168 hours after end of infusion; Subsequent cycles: Pre-dose (within 4 hours prior to infusion) and 0.5 hours after end of infusion on Day 1 and Day 15|Maximum Serum Concentration (Cmax) of FPA144, Cycle 1: Pre-dose (within 4 hours prior to infusion on Day 1) and 0.5, 3, 6, 24, 72, and 168 hours after end of infusion; Subsequent cycles: Pre-dose (within 4 hours prior to infusion) and 0.5 hours after end of infusion on Day 1 and Day 15|Trough Serum Concentration (Ctrough) of FPA144, Cycle 1: Pre-dose (within 4 hours prior to infusion on Day 1) and 0.5, 3, 6, 24, 72, and 168 hours after end of infusion; Subsequent cycles: Pre-dose (within 4 hours prior to infusion) and 0.5 hours after end of infusion on Day 1 and Day 15|Clearance (CL) of FPA144, Cycle 1: Pre-dose (within 4 hours prior to infusion on Day 1) and 0.5, 3, 6, 24, 72, and 168 hours after end of infusion; Subsequent cycles: Pre-dose (within 4 hours prior to infusion) and 0.5 hours after end of infusion on Day 1 and Day 15|Terminal Half-life (t1/2) of FPA144, Cycle 1: Pre-dose (within 4 hours prior to infusion on Day 1) and 0.5, 3, 6, 24, 72, and 168 hours after end of infusion; Subsequent cycles: Pre-dose (within 4 hours prior to infusion) and 0.5 hours after end of infusion on Day 1 and Day 15|Volume of Distribution of FPA144, Cycle 1: Pre-dose (within 4 hours prior to infusion on Day 1) and 0.5, 3, 6, 24, 72, and 168 hours after end of infusion; Subsequent cycles: Pre-dose (within 4 hours prior to infusion) and 0.5 hours after end of infusion on Day 1 and Day 15
Number of Participants who Experience Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs), TEAEs will be graded using the NCI CTCAE version 4.03. Any clinically significant laboratory abnormalities will also be reported as TEAEs., Approximately 1 year
