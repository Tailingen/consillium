Plasma Metabolic Biomarkers for Gastric Cancer Diagnosis
The aim of this observational study is to comprehensively analyze the metabolites in plasma samples from gastric cancer patients using advanced mass spectrometry detection technology, in conjunction with both broad-spectrum and targeted metabolomics approaches. The goal is to construct a dedicated plasma metabolite database for gastric cancer patients. Simultaneously, we will delve into the exploration and validation of a series of metabolic biomarkers for early gastric cancer diagnosis. The objective is to establish a safer, more convenient, and more sensitive early screening method, thereby providing a reliable scientific foundation and critical evidence for improving the early diagnostic process for individuals at high risk of gastric cancer.
Gastric Cancer
OTHER: Gastric cancer
Plasma metabolite content, The outcome will be tested by metabolomics detection technology based on mass spectrometry, Before receiving treatment for gastric cancer
Firstly, a wide-targeted metabolomic measurement will be conducted on plasma samples from the discovery cohort to identify potential metabolite candidate markers and construct a gastric cancer patient-specific metabolite database with extensive metabolite information.

Secondly, a more precise targeted metabolomic measurement will be conducted in the modeling cohort. Bioinformatics methods will be used to conduct an in-depth analysis of a wide range of metabolite information to screen out metabolic marker combinations with high gastric cancer-specific diagnostic efficacy.

Ultimately, an external validation cohort will be introduced to validate these metabolic biomarkers, aiming to ensure reliability and stability across different patient populations.
