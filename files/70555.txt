SEgmentectomy Versus Lobectomy in T1C Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (SELTIC)
The goal of this clinical trial is to investigate the role of segmentectomy in clinical T1c (2-3 cm) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The main questions we aim to answer are:

1. Is segmentectomy non-inferior to lobectomy in cT1c NSCLC in terms of overall and recurrence free survival?
2. What are the mortality and morbidity rates of segmentectomy compared to lobectomy?

Researchers will compare segmentectomy and lobectomy in terms of overall and recurrence free survival.

Participants will:

* Undergo either pulmonary lobectomy or segmentectomy with mediastinal nodal dissection
* Be followed up with a chest CT in every 3 months in first year, every 6 months in second year and every year for following 3 years
