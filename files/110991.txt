Hypofractionated Image Guided Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage IV Breast Cancer
This pilot clinical trial studies new ways to monitor the impact of hypofractionated image guided radiation therapy in treating patients with stage IV breast cancer. Radiation therapy uses high energy x rays to kill tumor cells. Giving radiation therapy in different ways may kill more tumor cells.
