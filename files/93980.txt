First-line Esophageal Carcinoma Study With Chemo vs. Chemo Plus Pembrolizumab (MK-3475-590/KEYNOTE-590)-China Extension Study
The purpose of this Chinese extension study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab plus cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) chemotherapy versus placebo plus cisplatin and 5-FU chemotherapy as first-line treatment in a Chinese cohort of participants with locally advanced or metastatic esophageal carcinoma.

The primary efficacy hypotheses are that both progression-free survival (PFS), according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 and determined by blinded independent central review, and overall survival (OS) are superior with pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy compared with placebo plus chemotherapy in all Chinese participants as well as Chinese participants whose tumors are programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive.

Progression-free Survival (PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 in all participants, PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression per RECIST 1.1 based on blinded independent central review or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. For this analysis, PFS will be assessed in all participants., Up to 2 years|PFS per RECIST Version 1.1 in PD-L1 biomarker-positive participants, PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression per RECIST 1.1 based on blinded independent central review or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. For this analysis, PFS will be assessed in PD-L1 biomarker-positive participants., Up to 2 years|Overall Survival (OS) in all participants, OS is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. For this analysis, OS will be assessed in all participants., Up to 2 years|OS in PD-L1 biomarker-positive participants, OS is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. For this analysis, OS will be assessed in PD-L1 biomarker-positive participants., Up to 2 years
Objective Response Rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1 in all participants, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who have a Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: ≥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1. For this analysis, ORR will be assessed in all participants., Up to 2 years|ORR per RECIST 1.1 in PD-L1 biomarker-positive participants, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who have a Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: ≥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1. For this analysis, ORR will be assessed in PD-L1 biomarker-positive participants., Up to 2 years|Duration of Response (DOR) per RECIST 1.1 in all participants, For participants who demonstrate CR (disappearance of all target lesions) or PR (≥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters), DOR is defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until disease progression per RECIST 1.1 based on assessments by blinded independent central review or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. For this analysis, DOR will be assessed in all participants., Up to 2 years|DOR per RECIST 1.1 in PD-L1 biomarker-positive participants, For participants who demonstrate CR (disappearance of all target lesions) or PR (≥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters), DOR is defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until disease progression per RECIST 1.1 based on assessments by blinded independent central review or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. For this analysis, DOR will be assessed in PD-L1 biomarker-positive participants., Up to 2 years|Number of participants with an adverse event (AE), An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, is also an AE., Up to 27 months|Number of participants discontinuing study treatment due to an AE, An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, is also an AE., Up to 2 years|Change from baseline in the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (QLQ-C30) Score, The EORTC QLQ-C30 was developed to assess the quality of life of patients with cancer. It contains 30 questions (items), 24 of which aggregate into nine multi-item scales representing various aspects, or dimensions, of quality of life (QOL): one global scale, five functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea, pain), and six additional single-symptom items assessing additional symptoms commonly reported by cancer patients (dyspnoea, loss of appetite, insomnia, constipation and diarrhoea) and perceived financial impact of the disease. Individual items are scored on a 4-point scale (1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much). Raw scores for each scale are standardized into a range of 0 to 100 by linear transformation; a higher score on the global and functional scales represents a higher ("better") level of functioning, and a higher score on the symptom scale represents a higher ("worse") level of symptoms., Baseline, End of Treatment (~1 year)|Change from baseline in the EORTC Quality Of Life Questionnaire Oesophageal Module (QLQ-OES18) Score, The EORTC QLQ-OES18 is a disease-specific questionnaire developed and validated to address measurements specific to esophageal cancer. It contains 18 items and is based on four subscales-dysphagia (three items), eating (four items), reflux (two items) and pain (three items), as well as six single-item subscales-saliva swallowing, choking, dry mouth, taste, cough and speech. All items are scored using a four-point Likert scale that offers these response choices: 1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much. Raw scores are standardized into a range of 0 to 100 by linear transformation; higher symptom scores represent a higher ("worse") level of symptoms., Baseline, End of Treatment (~1 year)
The Chinese extension to MK-3475-590 (NCT03189719) will enroll a total of approximately 90 participants.
