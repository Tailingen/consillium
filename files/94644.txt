The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease Sodium (MELD-Na) Score in Non-cirrhotic Patients With Gastric Cancer
Gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer worldwide. Gastrectomy with lymphadenectomy is still the most effective treatment modality, depending on the stage and location. Despite many radiological, surgical and anesthetic innovations, serious complications such as anastomotic leakage, intra-abdominal abscesses, wound complications are seen secondary to gastrectomy. Many clinical studies have been conducted to prevent and predict these complications.

The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, in which bilirubin, international normalized ratio (INR) and serum creatinine values were used to determine surgical risks in patients scheduled for liver transplantation. Latter developed by adding serum sodium (Na) to the formula. The MELD-Na score is used to predict postoperative complications in non-cirrhotic patients because of its simple and easy calculation.Moreover, The Meld-Na score was later used to predict complications for surgical procedures other than liver surgery such as colorectal surgery.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the importance of the Meld-Na score in predicting the perioperative and postoperative outcomes in patients with gastric cancer.
