The Effect of the Application of Head Mounted Magnifying Glasses on Postoperative PTH Changes in Thyroid Surgery: Stage II
This study is a prospective research. This study aims to investigate and follow up patients who undergo open thyroidectomy in the Department of Breast and Thyroid Surgery at Shandong Provincial Hospital from January 2020 to December 2025. This study was divided into an experimental group and a control group based on whether a head mounted magnifying glass was used, with the main calculation indicator being changes in PTH levels before and after surgery. This study investigated whether the application of head mounted magnifying glasses had an impact on preoperative and postoperative changes in PTH levels through inter group and self pre - and post control, in order to verify the practical effectiveness of head mounted magnifying glasses in thyroid surgery and provide reasonable suggestions for the selection of subsequent surgical treatment methods.

In thyroid surgery, changes in postoperative parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels have a significant impact on the patients recovery and long-term health status. Parathyroid hormone is responsible for regulating blood calcium levels, and its dysfunction can cause serious electrolyte imbalance and metabolic problems. In the process of thyroid surgery, especially in total thyroidectomy, protecting the function of the parathyroid gland is an important operation. The diameter of the parathyroid gland is small and similar to the morphology of lymph nodes, making it susceptible to damage during surgery. Although traditional magnification tools such as surgical microscopes have certain effects, their operation is complex and their adaptability to surgical scenes is limited.

In recent years, as an emerging magnifying tool, head mounted magnifying glasses have been increasingly used in thyroid surgery due to their portability, ease of operation, and providing a larger field of view. Wearing a head mounted magnifying glass can not only improve the clarity of vision during surgery, increase the recognition rate of parathyroid glands and nerves, but also reduce the risk of parathyroid injury by improving surgical accuracy, thereby more effectively maintaining the stability of postoperative PTH levels. In addition, the use of head mounted magnifying glasses can reduce surgical time, intraoperative uncertainty, and the risk of postoperative complications.

This study systematically evaluates the changes in PTH levels before and after surgery to verify the practical effectiveness of head mounted magnifying glasses in thyroid surgery, and further explores the effectiveness of parathyroid gland protection strategies, optimizing surgical techniques, and improving patient surgical safety and postoperative quality of life. In addition, the results of this study also have guiding significance for the innovation and improvement of surgical instruments, which may promote the development of related technologies and equipment, and thus promote their application in a wider range of surgical fields.
