Immunogenicity Assessment of Peg-filgrastim vs. Neulasta® as Adjunct to Chemotherapy in Patients With Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to compare the immunogenicity of Peg-filgrastim versus Neulasta® as an adjunct to chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Lupin's Pegfilgrastim|DRUG: Neulasta®
Comparison of Cumulative Incidence of Anti-pegfilgrastim Antibodies (Binding and Neutralizing) to Pegfilgrastim Between Treatment Groups at the End of Cycle 4 (Day 84)., The difference in cumulative incidence of anti-pegfilgrastim antibodies (binding and neutralizing) (measured as difference in proportion of patients with antibodies) to Pegfilgrastim between study groups at the end of cycle 4 will be calculated. Those samples confirmed to be positive for binding antibodies were analyzed for presence of neutralizing antibodies to Pegfilgrastim., End of cycle 4, Day 84
Comparison of Cumulative Incidence of Anti-peg Antibodies (Binding and Neutralizing) Between Treatment Groups at the End of Cycle 4 (Day 84)., The presence of anti-peg antibodies (binding) (measured as difference in proportion of patients with antibodies) between treatment groups at the end of cycle 4 (Day 84) were compared and analysis for the ITT population, Day 84.|Comparison of Incidence of Anti-pegfilgrastim Antibodies (Binding & Neutralizing) to Pegfilgrastim Between Treatment Groups on Day 10, Day 21, Day 42, Day 63 and Day 84, Comparison of incidence of anti-pegfilgrastim antibodies (binding \& neutralizing) (measured as difference in proportion of patients with antibodies) to pegfilgrastim between treatment groups on Day 10, Day 21, Day 42, Day 63, Day 84. Analysis population : ITT, Assessment at each study visit on Day 10, Day 21, Day 42, Day 63, Day 84|Secondary Immunogenicity Endpoint, Comparison of incidence of anti-peg antibodies (binding \& neutralizing) (measured as difference in proportion of patients with antibodies) between treatment groups on Day 10, Day 21, Day 42, Day 63 and Day 84. Analysis population: ITT population, Day 10, Day 21, Day 42, Day 63 and Day 84.
