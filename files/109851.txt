αPD1-MSLN-CAR T Cells for the Treatment of MSLN-positive Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a single arm, open-label, dose escalation clinical study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of autologous mesothelin (MSLN)-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (MSLN-CAR) T cells secreting PD-1 nanobodies (αPD1-MSLN-CAR T cells) in patients with solid tumors.

This is a single arm, open-label, dose escalation clinical study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of autologous mesothelin (MSLN)-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (MSLN-CAR) T cells secreting PD-1 nanobodies (αPD1-MSLN-CAR T cells) in patients with solid tumors.The safety and efficacy of αPD1-MSLN-CAR T cells will be assessed in a standard 3+3 dose escalation approach. Four doses of CAR T cells will be evaluated in this study: 1×10\^5 CAR+ T cells/kg, 3×10\^5 CAR+ T cells/kg, 1×10\^6 CAR+ T cells/kg, and 3×10\^6 CAR+ T cells/kg.
