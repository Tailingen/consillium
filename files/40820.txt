Tuberous Sclerosis Complex and Lymphangioleiomyomatosis Pregnancy Registry (TSC-LAM Registry)
This study is an observational registry designed to gather information about Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) and Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) in pregnant women and their child.

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is caused by mutations in tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC 1) and tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC 2) leading to overactivation of the mammilian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway resulting in multiorgan disease. Specifically, patients are at risk for autism, epilepsy, intellectual disability, renal cysts, tuberous sclerosis associated neuropsychiatric disorder (TAND), lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), and benign tumors throughout the body including subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs), renal and liver angiomyolipomas (AMLs), and cardiac rhabdomyomas (rhabdomyomas).

Sporadic LAM occurs mostly in women and many patients with LAM have TSC gene mutations.

The purpose of this study is to gather information to help clinicians develop evidence-based guidance for the care of TSC and LAM patients during pregnancy and to provide screening recommendations for fetal TSC.

Participants will be asked to complete monthly online surveys screening for changes in the pregnancy, maternal health/medication changes, and other care. For infants enrolled after birth, clinical data will be collected and reviewed for up to 5 years of age.
