Study of Dasatinib vs Imatinib in Patients With Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) Who Did Not Have Favorable Response to Imatinib
The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that patients with CML who have not achieved optimal response after 3 months of treatment with imatinib will have a better response by switching to dasatinib compared to staying on their original imatinib regimen.
Chronic Phase Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Imatinib|DRUG: Dasatinib
Percentage of Patients Achieving Major Molecular Response (MMR) After 12 Months of CML Treatment, Major Molecular Response, is defined as a 3-log reduction in BCR-ABL transcripts from the standardized baseline, which represents 100% on the international scale, so a 3-log reduction is fixed at 0.1% for MMR; N/A = not applicable. 95% CI is Clopper-Pearson(Exact) two-sided 95% confidence intervals.

P-value is based on Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by Sokal score(high, intermediate, low, and unknown) and time between 3 month molecular analysis and randomization (\<=4 weeks vs \>4 weeks)., At 12 months after Day 1 initiation of 1st line treatment with imatinib or imatinib at any dose, after less than optimal response to first-line imatinib.
Median Time to Major Molecular Response (MMR), Median Time to Major Molecular Response (MMR) is the time between randomization date and first date that MMR (or MR4.5) criteria are satisfied. Participants who do not achieve MMR (or MR4.5) will be censored.

Major Molecular Response, is defined as a 3-log reduction in BCR-ABL transcripts from the standardized baseline, which represents 100% on the international scale, so a 3-log reduction is fixed at 0.1% for MMR., From randomization to study completion. Approximately 115 months|Time to Molecular Response (MR)^4.5, Time to Molecular Response (MR)\^4.5 is the time between randomization date and first date that MMR (or MR4.5) criteria are satisfied. Participants who do not achieve MMR (or MR4.5) will be censored.

MR4.5 is defined as a 4.5-log reduction in BCR-ABL transcript from the standardized baseline (0.0032% IS, either detectable disease \<= 0.0032% BCR-ABL (IS) or undetectable disease in cDNA (in same volume used for BCR-ABL) with \>= 32,000 ABL transcripts., From randomization to study completion. Approximately 115 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is the time from randomization date to progression date or death date, whichever occurs first. Participants who neither progress nor die will be censored.

Progression is defined as the following, meeting the criteria for accelerated or blast crisis CML are met at any time or death from any cause during treatment.

Accelerated phase of CML:

* The presence of â‰¥15%, but \< 30% blasts in the blood or bone marrow
* At least 30% blasts plus promyelocytes in the blood or bone marrow
* At least 20% peripheral basophils
* Thrombocytopenia (fewer than 100,000 platelets/mm3) unrelated to treatment.

Blast phase of CML

* At least 30% blasts in the blood or bone marrow
* Extramedullary involvement (e.g., chloromas), but not hepatosplenomegaly, From randomization to study completion. Approximately 115 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS is the time from randomization date to death date. Participants who have not died will be censored on the last date they are known to be alive., From randomization to study completion. Approximately 115 months
The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that patients with CML who have not achieved optimal response after 3 months of treatment with imatinib will have a better response by switching to dasatinib compared to staying on their original imatinib regimen.
