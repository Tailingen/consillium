A Study of Belantamab Mafodotin to Investigate Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, Immunogenicity and Clinical Activity in Participants With Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma (RRMM)
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a neoplastic plasma cell disorder that is characterized by osteolytic bone lesions, anemia, hypercalcemia and renal failure. belantamab mafodotin was well tolerated in previous studies with at least one dose of belantamab mafodotin in heavily pre-treated participants with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). This aim of the study is to explore safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), tolerability, immunogenicity and clinical activity of belantamab mafodotin monotherapy in Chinese participants with RRMM who have received at least 2 prior line of anti-myeloma therapy including an alkylator, a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an immunomodulatory agent (IMiD). This study will include two dose cohorts 2.5 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) and 3.4 mg/kg. A maximum of 12 participants will be enrolled, 6 each for 2.5 mg/kg cohort and 3.4 mg/kg cohort based on 3+3 design. Participants will be treated until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, end of study or informed consent withdrawal.
