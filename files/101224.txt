Buttressed Pancreatico-Gastrostomy for Soft Pancreas With Small Diameter Pancreatic Duct in Whipple Procedure
Post-operative pancreatic fistula after Pancreaticoduodenectomy procedure, is still a major complication that might be affected by pancreatic stump reconstruction technique. More than 60 techniques were published in literature. Soft pancreas and small pancreatic duct size were major risk factors for post-operative pancreatic fistula. Supporting Duct to Mucosa Pancreatico-Gastrostomy with trans-pancreatic transverse mattress U- Shaped sutures is a new and safe technique for decreasing the risk of post-operative pancreatic fistula in high-risk patients.
Pancreatic Fistula
PROCEDURE: Duct to Mucosa Pancreatico-Gastrostomy with trans-pancreatic transverse mattress U- Shaped sutures
Post operative Pancreatic Fistula, Detection of chemical or clinical pancreatic fluid discharge after post-operative day 3., up to 5 days (from time of surgery to time of detection of post-operative pancreatic fistula)
Post-operative pancreatic fistula after Pancreaticoduodenectomy procedure, is still a major complication that might be affected by pancreatic stump reconstruction technique. More than 60 techniques were published in literature. Soft pancreas and small pancreatic duct size were major risk factors for post-operative pancreatic fistula. Supporting Duct to Mucosa Pancreatico-Gastrostomy with trans-pancreatic transverse mattress U- Shaped sutures is a new and safe technique for decreasing the risk of post-operative pancreatic fistula in high-risk patients.

The authors used this technique in pancreato-gastrostomy. Data were collected, tabulated and analyzed to evaluate the new technique and its impact on the incidence of post-operative pancreatic fistula.
