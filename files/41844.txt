Powered Vascular Stapler in Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic (VAT) Lobectomies
This prospective, randomized, controlled, multi-center study will collect and compare data from the surgeon's current Standard Of Care stapler (for Pulmonary Artery/Pulmonary Vein transection) and powered vascular stapler.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DEVICE: Surgeon's 'standard of care' stapler|DEVICE: Ethicon Powered Vascular Stapler
Incidence of Intra-Operative Hemostatic Intervention, Incidence of hemostatic interventions/procedures completed for intra-operative bleeding related to the transection of the Pulmonary Artery and Pulmonary Vein during Video Assisted Thoracoscopic lobectomy with the use of standard of care stapler (SOC) or powered vascular stapler (PVS) defined as bleeding detected and controlled intraoperatively (additional stapling, over-sewing, clip placement, compression, use of suture, sealant, and/or buttress, and/or use of energy); or bleeding that occurs intra-operatively requiring blood or blood product transfusion or an additional surgical procedure (e.g. conversion to open)., Intra-Operative, an average of 2.3 hours, ranging from 30 mintues to 6.4 hours
Post-operative Interventions or Procedures Related to Pulmonary Artery or Pulmonary Vein Bleeding, Incidence of hemostatic interventions /procedures completed for post-operative bleeding related to the transection of the PA and PV during VATS lobectomy with the use of SOC or PVS:

* Hemostasis intervention: bleeding that occurs post-operatively requiring blood or blood product transfusion or an additional surgical procedure (related to PA and PV transection).

No hemostasis intervention is defined as no interventions needed for post-operative bleeding (related to PA and PV transection)., Post-Op through 4 Week Followup
