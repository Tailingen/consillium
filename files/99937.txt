A Clinical Trial to Evaluate Tolerability and Security of TQB2858 Injection in Subjects With Advanced Pancreatic Carcinoma
This study is divided into three phases: single-dose exploration, combination dosage exploration and cohort expansion. The Single-dose exploration stage aims to evaluate the tolerability of TQB2858 injection in subjects with advanced pancreatic carcinoma. The Combination dosage exploration stage aims to evaluate the tolerance of TQB2858 injection combined with chemotherapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. The cohort expansion phase aims to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of TQB2858 injection combined with gemcitabine, albumin paclitaxel, and with or without anlotinib in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer，and to explore treatment-related biomarkers.
Pancreatic Carcinoma
DRUG: TQB2858 injection|DRUG: Anlotinib Hydrochloride Capsule|DRUG: Gemcitabine hydrochloride for injection|DRUG: Paclitaxel for injection (albumin bound)
Dose limiting toxicity (DLT), Grade 3 or 4 adverse events related to the study drug that occurred during cycle 1, Baseline up to 3 weeks|Recommended phase II dose (RP2D), Recommended dose for phase II, Baseline up to 3 weeks|Overall response rate (ORR), ORR refers to the percentage of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) subjects determined by the investigator based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 or iRECIST (CR and PR under iRECIST criteria can occur after imaging disease progression)., Baseline up to 30 weeks
Adverse event rate, The occurrence of all adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) and treatment-related adverse events (TEAEs)., Baseline up to 96 weeks|Disease control rate (DCR), DCR refers to the percentage of subjects with CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) of 6 weeks or more as determined by RECIST 1.1 or iRECIST (CR, PR, SD under iRECIST criteria can occur after imaging disease progression)., Baseline up to 30 weeks|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR will be defined as median number of months from date of first documented objective response until first documented sign of disease progression or death due to any causes., Baseline up to 30 weeks|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS will be defined as median number of months from the date of randomization until the first documented sign of disease progression or death due to any causes, whichever occurs first., Baseline up to 30 weeks|Overall survival (OS), From randomization to the time of death from any cause., Baseline up to 96 weeks
