Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Efficacy of CT-707, Toripalimab and Gemcitabine in Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
This study will assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and antineoplastic activity of CT-707 in combination with toripalimab and gemcitabine in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer
Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: CT-707|DRUG: Toripalimab|DRUG: Gemcitabine
Recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of CT-707 in combination with toripalimab and gemcitabine, The RP2D will be determined from the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) found in the dose-escalation cohort. The MTD is determined as the dose at which no more than one patient (out of six) experiences any drug-related toxicity (DLT), Up to 24 months
Incidence of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), Characterization of the safety and tolerability as determined by changes in laboratory values and electrocardiograms, Up to 24 months|Pharmacokinetics (Cmax) for CT-707, Defined as maximum observed plasma concentration, Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Pharmacokinetics (Tmax) for CT-707, Defined as time to maximum plasma concentration, Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Pharmacokinetics (AUC0-t) for CT-707, Defined as area under the single-dose plasma concentration-time curve from Hour 0 to the last quantifiable measurable plasma concentration, Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Pharmacokinetics (tÂ½) for CT-707, Defined as the apparent plasma terminal phase disposition half-life, Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Overall response rate (ORR) as assessed by RECIST 1.1 criteria, Preliminary measure of anti-tumor activity of CT-707 in combination with toripalimab and gemcitabine, Up to 24 months|Progression free survival (PFS) according to RECIST v1.1 criteria, Preliminary measure of anti-tumor activity of CT-707 in combination with toripalimab and gemcitabine, Up to 24 months|Disease control rate (DCR) according to RECIST v1.1, Preliminary measure of anti-tumor activity of CT-707 in combination with toripalimab and gemcitabine, Up to 24 months
Predictive biomarkers for response to the combination of CT-707, toripalimab and gemcitabine, To assess putative predictive biomarkers such as PD-L1 and p-FAK, Up to 24 months
This is a phase Ib/II, open-label, dose-escalation and dose-expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and antineoplastic activity of CT-707 in combination with toripalimab and gemcitabine in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.The study consists of two parts, dose-escalation part and dose-expansion part. Both parts will enroll patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. Dose-escalation study is designed to determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLTs) and recommended phase II dose (RP2D), and to characterize the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of CT-707 in combination with toripalimab and gemcitabine. Dose-expansion study phase is designed to evaluate the antitumor activity (objective response rate, progression-free survival, overall survival) of CT-707 in combination with toripalimab and gemcitabine in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.
