DIEP Flap Surgery and Intraabdominal Pressure
Aim: The primary aim of this study is to test if closure of the abdominal donor site increases the Intraabdominal Pressure (IAP) in women undergoing secondary Deep Inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap breast reconstruction.

Materials and method: By an Unometer, attached to a standard catheter in the bladder, we measured the intravesical pressure as a surrogate marker for the IAP, at baseline, immediate after- and 24 hours after abdominal skin closure, for 13 patients.
