68Ga-NOTA-RM26 PET/CT in Prostate Cancer Patients
This is an open-label positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) study to investigate the diagnostic performance and evaluation efficacy of 68Ga-NOTA-RM26 in prostate cancer patients. A single dose of 111-148 Mega-Becquerel (MBq) 68Ga-NOTA-RM26 will be injected intravenously. Visual and semiquantitative method will be used to assess the PET/CT images.

Adverse events collection, Adverse events within 1 week after the injection and scanning of patients and patients will be followed and assessed, 1 week
The gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR), also known as bombesin receptor subtype II (BB2), is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family of bombesin receptors. GRPR is over-expressed in various types of human tumors including prostate cancer. RM26, a GRPR antagonist with high affinity, was discovered by peptide backbone modification of bombesin analogues.To target gastrin-releasing peptide receptor in neoplastic cells of human prostate cancer, peptide NOTA-RM26 was synthesized with a PEG3 linker between NOTA and RM26, and then labeled with 68Ga. An open-label whole-body PET/ CT study was designed to investigate the safety and dosimetry of 68Ga-NOTA-RM26 and to assess its clinical diagnostic value in patients with prostate cancer.
