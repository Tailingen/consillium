A Real-world Study of Obinutuzumab-based Therapy for Previously Untreated FL
This study aims to observe and explore the efficacy and safety of obinutuzumab-based therapy for previously untreated follicular lymphoma
Follicular Lymphoma
DRUG: Obinutuzumab|DRUG: Lenalidomide|DRUG: Bendamustine|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Doxorubicin|DRUG: Vincristine|DRUG: Prednisone
Objective response rate (ORR), Percentage of participants with overall response was determined on the basis of investigator assessments according to 2014 Lugano criteria, End of treatment visit (6 weeks after last dose on Day 1 of Cycle 6 [Cycle length=21 days]
Complete response rate (CR), Percentage of participants with complete response was determined on the basis of investigator assessments according to 2014 Lugano criteria., End of treatment visit (6 weeks after last dose on Day 1 of Cycle 6 [Cycle length=21 days]|Progression free survival, Progression-free survival was defined as the time from the date of first treatment until the date of the first documented day of disease progression or relapse, using 2014 Lugano criteria, or death from any cause, whichever occurred first., Baseline up to data cut-off (up to approximately 2 years)|Duration of response, Time from first occurrence of documented CR or PR to disease progression/relapse, or death from any cause for participants with a response of CR or PR. Tumor assessments were performed with PET-CT., Baseline up to data cut-off (up to approximately 2 years)
This study aims to observe and explore the efficacy and safety of obinutuzumab-based therapy for previously untreated follicular lymphoma. This study is a non-interventional real world, observational study and all registered data are collected from real clinical practice cases. The medical data includes patient demographic, tumor characteristics, laboratory examination, history of treatments, adverse reactions, efficacy results and possible prognostic factors.
