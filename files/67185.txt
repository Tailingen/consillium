ctDNA-Guided CURB for OPD mNSCLC on TKI (CURB-TKI)
This is an open-label, prospective single arm Phase II trial that investigates the role of ablative stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in oncogene driven metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC) patients with oligoprogressive disease (OPD) on targeted therapy (TKI) followed by circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis for tailoring targeted therapies.
Metastatic NSCLC - Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer|OligoProgressive Metastatic Disease
RADIATION: Radiotherapy|RADIATION: Radiotherapy
Progression-free-survival, Progression-free-survival 1 (PFS1) will be determined from the first day of SBRT to oligoprogressive sites to the day of diagnosis of radiological progression in the subsequent imaging (irrespective of change in systemic therapy in group B, essentially second-line) or death, 1 year
Subsequent progression-free-survival, Subsequent PFS will be calculated from the date of first radiological progression after SBRT to second radiological progression or change to 3rd line systemic therapy or death or loss to follow-up, whichever comes first., 1 year|Acute and Late Toxicities, For SBRT combined with TKI (using CTCAE Version 5.0), 1 year|Reported Adverse Events, PRO-CTCAE Questionnaire, 1 year|Quality of Life Outcome, QLQ-LC1 Questionnaire, 1 year|Quality of Life Outcome, EORTC-QLQ-C30 Questionnaire, 1 year|Cost-effectiveness, EQ-5D-5L Questionnaire, 1 year
