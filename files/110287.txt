Fruquintinib and Pirfenidone in Combination With Anti-PD-1 Antibody in Advanced or Metastatic pMMR/MSS Colorectal Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fruquintinib and pirfenidone in combination with anti-PD-1 antibody in patients with standard treatment failure of advanced or metastatic pMMR/MSS colorectal adenocarcinoma.
To Evaluate the Efficacy of Fruquintinib and Pirfenidone in Combination With Anti-PD-1 Antibody in Colorectal Carcinoma|To Evaluate Whether Pirfenidone Can Reshape the Tumor Microenvironment in Colorectal Cancer|Combination of Fruquintinib and Anti-PD-1 Antibody Was Reported to Improve Patient Prognosis in Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Pirfenidone|DRUG: Fruquintinib|DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Progression Free Survival (PFS), The time from enrollment until tumor progression or death from any cause, whichever occurred first, 2 year|Occurrence of Grade 4 toxicity, CTCAE v5.0, Cycle 1 day 1 to Cycle 3 day 1 (Each cycle is 21 days)|Occurrence of Grade 3 toxicity, CTCAE v5.0, Cycle 1 day 1 to Cycle 3 day 1 (Each cycle is 21 days
Objective response rate (ORR), The proportion of patients with a PR or CR, 2 year|Overall Survival (OS), The time calculated from enrollment until death from any cause, with living patients censored at the last known survival date, 2 year|Disease control rate (DCR), The proportion of patients with a PR, CR, or SD, 2 year|Duration of response (DoR), For patients who achieved a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), the time from the first tumor assessment demonstrating response until disease progression or death, whichever occurred first, 2 year
In this study, we explored the potential effectiveness of fruquintinib and pirfenidone in combination with anti-PD-1 antibody, in MSS/pMMR unresectable locally advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer patients who failed standard chemotherapy and testified this new combination in preclinical models. 25 patients were included.
