Trial of Neoadjuvant Therapy With Paclitaxel and Carboplatin in Operable Locally Advanced Head and Neck Cancer Patients
- Objective: Primary objective: To evaluate the major pathologic response (mPR) of locally advanced head and neck cancer after paclitaxel and carboplatin-induction chemotherapy followed by surgery.

Secondary objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of induction chemotherapy. Outcome metrics: Local relapse rate (LRR), Relapse-free survival (RFS), Overall survival (OS), Adverse reactions according to CTCAE 5.0 Exploratory Purpose: To evaluate changes in circulating tumor cells (CTC) and immunodynamics before and after paclitaxel and carboplatin-induction chemotherapy through blood, biopsy specimens, and surgical specimen analysis.

* background :

  * Chemoradiation (CRT) or chemotherapy (Induction Chemotherapy (IC) + CRT) after induction chemotherapy has been performed for locally advanced head and neck cancer that cannot be operated immediately or for organ function preservation. .
  * The efficacy of induction chemotherapy before chemotherapy has been controversial because the results of several phase 3 clinical studies are inconsistent. At present, it is difficult to assert the superiority of either the addition of induction chemotherapy or radiation therapy alone, but in certain subgroups (advanced N stage such as N2c/N3) induction chemotherapy is a useful option to lower distant metastases. I can do it.
  * As a result of the TAX324 clinical trial, when weekly carboplatin-based chemotherapy or surgery was performed after adjuvant Docetaxel + Cisplatin + 5FU chemotherapy, overall survival was improved compared to Cisplatin + 5FU (HR 0.7, p=0.0058), It resulted in improvement of institutional retention rate (3 year LFS: 52% vs 32%). However, it is difficult to apply this TPF therapy to all patients in actual clinical practice due to the toxicity (neutropenia, nephrotoxicity) and the limitation of anticancer radiation.
  * In a retrospective study, in the case of adjuvant paclitaxel + carboplatin, there was no difference in progression-free survival compared to TPF (p=0.15), and there was no statistically significant decrease in the local recurrence rate (HR 0.27, p = 0.04). Confirmed.
  * Therefore, in this study, when paclitaxel and carboplatin-induction chemotherapy followed by surgery and chemotherapy after surgery, compared to standard TPF-induced chemotherapy, it is expected that the clinical outcome will be improved with less toxicity.
* Hypothesis: Paclitaxel and carboplatin-induction chemotherapy followed by surgery, followed by chemo-radiation after surgery according to standard guidelines Compared with the existing standard treatment (TCF), improvement of clinical outcome with less toxicity
* Study procedure

  * Induction chemotherapy Paclitaxel 175mg/m2 + Carboplatin AUC5 (calculated by Cockcroft - Gault formula) Combination therapy A total of 2 intravenous infusions every 3 weeks Surgery performed within 2-9 weeks after induction chemotherapy
  * surgery The surgery in this study means a complete resection for the purpose of a complete cure, and aims for a minimally invasive surgery.
