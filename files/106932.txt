Feasibility and Clinical Utility of Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in Identifying Actionable Alterations and Minimal Residual Disease for Lymphoma Patients Across Community Centers in Texas
To test the feasibility of collecting cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples from DLBCL patients before and after treatment. cfDNA is DNA traveling in your blood outside of a cell and is easily collected from blood samples drawn using the vein puncture method.
Lymphoma
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: cell-free DNA
Overall Survival (OS), through study completion; an average 1 year
Primary Objective:

â€¢ To determine the feasibility and clinical utility of ctDNA in identifying actionable alterations and minimal residual disease for lymphoma patients across community centers in Texas.

Secondary Objectives:

* To provide useful prognostic information before treatment, assess molecular response at interim time points and residual disease at the end of therapy, and identify tumor-specific mutations
* Levels of cfDNA and its association with both EFS and OS in patients receiving therapy
