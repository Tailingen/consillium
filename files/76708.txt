Combined Haploidentical-Cord Blood Transplantation for Adults and Children
The primary objective is to assess the rate of engraftment with combined haploidentical-cord blood transplantation. The secondary objective is to evaluate the incidence and severity of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

Percentage of Participants With Neutrophil Engraftment, Cumulative incidence of graft failure (neutrophil) by day 28 was reported. Patients who did not have neutrophil engraftment before death was considered as a competing risk. Failure to engraft was defined as lack of evidence of hematopoietic recovery (ANC \<500/mm3 and platelet count \< 20,000/mm3) by day +35, confirmed by a biopsy revealing a marrow cellularity \< 5%. Graft failure was also defined as initial myeloid engraftment by day +35, documented to be of donor origin, followed by a drop in the ANC to \< 500/mm3 for more than three days, independent of any myelosuppressive drugs, severe GVHD, CMV, or other infection., Transplant (Day 0) through Day +28
Percentage of Participants With Incidence of Acute (Grade II-IV) and Chronic Graft-vs-host Disease(GVHD), Acute GVHD is defined by the Przepiorka criteria, which stages the degree of organ involvement in the skin, liver, and gastrointestinal (GI) tract, based on severity, with Stage 1+ being least severe and stage 4+ being the most severe. Grading of acute GVHD is as follows: Grade II (skin involvement stages 1+ to 3+, liver 1+, GI tract 1+), Grade III (skin involvement stages 2+ to 3+, liver 1+, GI tract 2+ to 4+), Grade IV (skin involvement stages 4+, Liver 4+).

Chronic GVHD is assessed by NIH consensus development project on criteria for clinical trials in chronic graft-versus-host disease: I. Diagnosis and staging working group report. Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2005; 11:945-56., for grading criteria. (See Citation: Filipovich AH et al)

The incidence of patients with acute GVHD (Grade II-IV) was determined at 180 days. The incidence of Chronic GVHD by 2 years was reported, Up to 2 years|Overall Survival- Percentage of Participants Who Survived at 2 Years and 5 Years, We reported overall survival at 2 years and 5 years after transplant, up to 5 years
