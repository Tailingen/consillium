Safety parameter Physical Examination, Frequency of occurrence and severity of abnormal findings in safety investigations regarding the physical examination., 9 days|Safety parameter Vital Signs, Frequency of occurrence and severity of abnormal findings in safety investigations regarding the Vital signs, 9 days|Safety parameter Laboratory examinations, Frequency of occurrence and severity of abnormal findings in safety investigations regarding Laboratory examinations., 9 days|Safety parameter concomitant medications, Frequency of occurrence and severity of abnormal findings in safety investigations regarding concomitant medications., 9 days|Safety parameter ECG, Frequency of occurrence and severity of abnormal findings in the 12-lead ECG (ECG QT Interval), 9 days
Whole blood radioactivity PK parameters, This outcome will be measured by analysing the radioactivity present in the blood at baseline (pre-dose), 0.5h, 1h, 2h, 4h, 24h, 72h and Day 5+/-1 day. Assessments include: Cmax (maximum concentration), 6 days|Radiation dosimetry, whole body PET/CT scans will be acquired in supine position at 0.5, 4, 24, 72 and 168±24 h (Day 7±1) post injection, using low dose CT without contrast agent. Normalized Absorbed Dose = Absorbed Dose/ Administered Dose, 8 days|Tumour dosimetry, Normalised whole body effective radiation dose (mSv/MBq), Whole body PET/CT scans will be acquired in supine position at 0.5, 4, 24, 72 and 168±24 h (Day 7±1) post injection
