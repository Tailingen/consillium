Horse Therapy for Children, Adolescents and Young Adults in Remission From Medulloblastoma
On average, each year in the former region, 60 new patients under the age of 18 are treated for a brain tumor, with an active post-treatment follow-up file of 350 patients. Because of the significant sequelae induced by the disease or the treatments, these patients will very often require rehabilitative care.

The interest of involving the horse in the population of patients cured of a medulloblastoma but with important physical and psychological after-effects is to be able to combine a therapy using animal mediation (equitherapy) and a rehabilitation therapy based on the three-dimensional movement of the horse (hippotherapy).
