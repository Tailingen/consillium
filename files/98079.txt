A Multicenter, Prospective, Randomized Trial of Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Early-Stage Cervical Cancer Patients
We will conduct a trial to determine whether paclitaxel/cisplatin (TP) as an adjuvant chemotherapy after radical surgery improve disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), as well as the quality of life (QoL) among early-stage (FIGO stage IB-IIA) cervical cancer patients with risk factors.
