Low-moderate Intensity Pedaling During Immunotherapy Administration
The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility pedaling using an under-the desk bike during immunotherapy infusions. Also, the study hopes to evaluate how pedaling impacts quality of life and treatment response biomarkers. Lastly, the study will evaluate the relationships between treatment response and muscle mass which is evaluated with computerized tomography (CT) scans.

Feasibility of Pedaling Concurrent to Immunotherapy Infusions, The number of completed pedaling sessions as well as the ability of patients to meet goal pedaling intensities will be evaluated., 12 weeks
Quality of life scores, Quality of life markers will be assessed using the Quality of Life Questionnaire - Core 30, at baseline and following their fourth immunotherapy treatment., 12 weeks|Treatment response biomarkers, Treatment response biomarkers (check point inhibitors, functional T and B cell subsets, pro and anti-inflammatory monocyte subsets, and soluble inflammatory mediators) will be drawn before and immediately following first and fourth immunotherapy treatments. All biomarkers are available as either part of the MILLIPLEXÂ® MAP Human High-sensitivity T-cell Assay or the ProcartaPlex Human Immuno-Oncology Checkpoint Panel. All assays will be run according to the manufacturer's recommended protocols on a Luminex FlexMAP 3D system with concentrations calculated based on 7-point standard curves., 12 weeks|CT-derived sarcopenia rates, CT images will be gathered at the time of diagnosis and following completion of immunotherapy treatments. Patient's CT scans will be uploaded to a medical image analysis software (SliceOmatic), which allows for the evaluation of body composition, focusing on sarcopenia or muscle depletion., 12 weeks
