Pharmacokinetics of Anti-tuberculosis Drugs in Gastrectomized Patients
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of gastrectomy on pharmacokinetic profile of first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB).
Tuberculosis|Tuberculosis, Pulmonary|Early Gastric Cancer
DRUG: standard first line anti-TB drugs
The change in the maximum concentration (Cmax) of first-line TB drugs, Before and 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 hours after dosing
The effects of pharmacokinetics on responses of pulmonary TB to anti-TB drug, Treatment duration can be varied according to several factors such as a first TB episode or not, cavitary TB, and AFB culture(+) after 2month-treatment etc. We will plan 6 or 9 months treatment for each patient according to these factors. During treatment period, we will check chest radiographs and sputum AFB smear/culture with every 2-3month intervals. At 9month after treatment, we will evaluate the effects of pharmacokinetics on responses of pulmonary TB to anti-TB drug by taking account of improvement on chest radiograph and negative conversion and its continuation on sputum smear/culture., 9month after anti-TB treatment
Gastrectomy is a well-known risk factor for TB. Also, there were some reports about malabsorption of anti-TB drugs in the gastrectomized patients. However, pharmacokinetics of recently used first line anti-TB drugs in the gastrectomized patients have not been well evaluated simultaneously. Therefore, the investigators aim to evaluate the effect of gastrectomy on pharmacokinetic profile of first-line anti-TB drugs in patients with pulmonary TB through this study.
