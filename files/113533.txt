The Impact of Melanoma and Drug Treatment in the Real World
An observational, non-interventional registry study to collect real-world data from people living with melanoma and its treatment, which will be available to researchers to further the knowledge of melanoma and improve patient care.

Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQL), general, EQ-5D-5L, Monthly throughout 4 year study duration

The registry uses Vitaccess' digital real-world evidence platform, and has been developed in collaboration with the patient advocacy group Melanoma UK.

Eligible participants install a study app on their smartphone or tablet. Researchers access aggregated, anonymised data via a cloud-based research portal. The platform provides benefits to participants, which it is hoped will encourage persistence with data submission; these include options to upload electronic documents such as scans, and access an online melanoma community.

The aggregated data are available in close to real time via "dashboards" and can be analysed according to a number of pre-set criteria (e.g. disease stage, age, geographic location).

State-of-the-art technologies and security policies are used in the platform to ensure industry-standard data storage and privacy for all users. Participants' personally identifiable information will remain confidential at all times, and researchers will not be able to identify individuals.
