Dasatinib in Treating Patients With Solid Tumors or Lymphomas That Are Metastatic or Cannot Be Removed By Surgery
This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of dasatinib in treating patients with solid tumors or lymphomas that are metastatic or cannot be removed by surgery. Dasatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

DRUG: Dasatinib|OTHER: Pharmacological Study
Maximum tolerated dose of dasatinib, defined as the highest dose level at which less than 33% of 6-9 evaluable patients experience dose-limiting toxicity, Toxicity will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE v3.0., 28 days|Pharmacokinetic parameters of dasatinib, Area under curve (AUC)(to infinity), AUC(to 24 hours), and maximum concentration (Cmax) analyzed in the natural log scale. For each PK parameter, the mean difference between the recommended dose for a liver impairment group and the normal liver function group dosed at 140 mg OD (equivalent to ratios of geometric means in the non-log scale) will be tested against 0 at a one-sided 0.05 significance level to detect an increase in the liver impairment group (equivalent to a 2-sided 90% confidence interval)., Days 1 and 8 of course 1
Liver dysfunction data, The Child-Pugh classification (CPC), NCI Organ Dysfunction Working Group (ODWG) Stratification Criteria for all patients will be collected at baseline and correlated to the toxicities and pharmacokinetic data seen with dasatinib in an exploratory analysis. Clearance estimates for each liver impairment group based upon the NCI ODWG Criteria, CPC Scheme, will be correlated with drug clearance. Ultimately, the predictive value of these various different methods of grouping organ dysfunction patients will be compared to determine if any method is better able to predict dasatinib clearance., Baseline
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of dasatinib in patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment.

II. To estimate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of this drug in patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment.

III. To assess the safety profile and dose-limiting toxicities (if any) of dasatinib in patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To describe any antitumor efficacy associated with dasatinib administration in patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment.

II. To examine whether the pharmacokinetic clearance of dasatinib correlates with hepatic function as assessed by Child-Pugh Criteria, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Organ Dysfunction Working Group Criteria, or other assessments of liver function.

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

Patients receive dasatinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 28 days.
