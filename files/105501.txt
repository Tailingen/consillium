Induction Chemotherapy for Locally Advanced Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck
This is a non-randomized, open-label phase II trial of 40 patients with poor prognosis head and neck cancer, defined as surgically unresectable and/or ≥N2b disease and judged appropriate for non-surgical definitive therapy.
Head and Neck Cancer
DRUG: Cetuximab|DRUG: Nab-paclitaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin
Clinical Response Rate Following Induction Chemotherapy, Evaluation of target lesions via imaging with CT or MRI scans at 2-3 weeks post induction chemotherapy. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions., 9 weeks
Rate of Complete Response Following Induction Chemotherapy, Report the rate of complete responses, defined as disappearance of all target lesions, following induction chemotherapy. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions., Baseline evaluation to 3 weeks after induction chemotherapy|Progression Free Survival, Rate of Progression Free Survival (Time to death or progression defined by imaging of target lesions via CT or MRI scan post induction chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy every 3 months for one year), 1 year|Objective Response Rate (CR+PR), Objective Response Rate as defined by RECIST 1.1 after induction chemotherapy followed by definitive chemoradiation. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Objective Response (OR) = CR + PR., 20 weeks|Complete Response Rate (CR), Complete Response Rate as defined by RECIST 1.1 after induction chemotherapy followed by definitive chemoradiation, 20 weeks|Overall Survival, Rate of Overall Survival, 1 year|Number of Participants With at Least One Grade 3-4 Toxicity, Toxicity will be assessed according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4., 9 Weeks|Number of Participants With at Least One Grade 3-4 Toxicity, Listed by Event, Toxicity will be assessed according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4., 24 Weeks|Patient-reported Quality of Life Scores, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Head \& Neck (FACT-HN) is the FACT-G and a 12 item head and neck cancer specific subscale completed at screening (Screening), 3 weeks post induction chemotherapy (Treatment Break), 7 weeks post concomitant chemoradiotherapy (7 weeks Off Treatment), one year post off-treatment (1 year Off Treatment). The FACT-G is a 27 item measure of general QOL assessing function in 4 domains: physical well-being (PWB), social-family well-being (SFWB), emotional well-being (EWB) and functional well-being (FWB). Items are rated by patients on a Likert scale from 0 to 4 (resulting in potential total scores between 0 and 156). Higher scores represent better QOL., screening until one year after treatment
This is a non-randomized, open-label phase II trial of 40 patients with poor prognosis head and neck cancer, defined as surgically unresectable and/or ≥N2b disease and judged appropriate for non-surgical definitive therapy. Patients must have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1 with good organ function and will be treated with six weekly cycles of carboplatin, nab-paclitaxel and cetuximab prior to scheduled concomitant chemoradiation. The study is designed to evaluate whether this induction regimen can result in an improved response rate (complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)) with less toxicity than the current standard induction docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (TPF) regimen.
