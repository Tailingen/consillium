The Role of Narrow Band Imaging Videobronchoscopy in Lung Cancer
Narrow band imaging (NBI) videobronchoscopy is an optical technique in which filtered light enhances superficial neoplasm based on their neoangiogenic pattern. The objectives of this study investigate its better diagnostic yield in the assessment of lung cancer than conventional flexible bronchoscopy.
Lung Cancer
accuracy of NBI videobronchoscopic biopsy, Define and compare the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, likelihood ratio and accuriacies for the diagnostic techniques for lung cancer., 10-11 months
early cancer lesion detection rate using Shibuya descriptors, Define and compare the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, likelihood ratio and accuriacies for the diagnostic techniques for early lung cancer., 10-11 months
Inspection with high resolution endoscopy was followed by NBI. Detected lesions were biopsied. applied the system of shibuya et al. to analyze and classify vascular patterns by NBI into four categories (spiral and screw pattern, dotted pattern, tortuous pattern, avascular pattern) compared with the known diagnostic yield of conventional white light bronchoscopy, An equivalent or superior result will also significantly impact on patient care This technology could aid not only early-stage lung cancer diagnosis but also more accurate local staging of lung cancer.
