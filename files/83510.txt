Study of Weekly DCF to Treat Advanced Gastric Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of weekly docetaxol combined with cisplatin and 5-Fu in patients with AGC.
Gastric Cancer
DRUG: Docetaxel, Cisplatin, 5-Fu
Response rate, overall survival, 2-6 months
Side effects, 2-6 month
Recently,in a multi-center, open-label randomized phase III study (V325), compared to the control arm of CF regimen, DCF showed higher efficacy in terms of response rate, time to progression and overall survival. But the regimen had increased grade 3-4 neutropenia (82% vs 57%) and febrile neutropenia infection (29% vs 12%). We began to study on weekly DCF in the patients with advanced gastric cancer to evaluate the efficacy no less than that of 3-week' regimen.
