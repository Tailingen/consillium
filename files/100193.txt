IRDye800CW-BBN PET-NIRF Imaging Guiding Surgery in Patients With Glioblastoma
This is an open-label positron emission tomography/near infrared (PET/NIRF) study to investigate the imaging navigation performance and evaluation efficacy of dual modality imaging probe 68Ga-BBN-IRDye800CW in glioblastoma (GBM) patients. A single dose of 40Î¼g/111-148 Mega-Becquerel (MBq) and 1.0 mg/ml 68Ga-BBN-IRDye800CW will be injected intravenously before the operation and intraoperative respectively. Visual and semiquantitative method will be used to assess the PET images and real-time margins localization for surgical navigation.

DRUG: 68Ga-BBN-IRDye800CW|DEVICE: PET/NIRF|PROCEDURE: PET/NIR fluorescent imaging-guided surgery
Standardized uptake value of 68Ga-BBN-IRDye800CW in PET imaging of GBM, The semiquantitative analysis will be performed by the same person for all the cases, and the standardized uptake value (SUV) of the tracer in GBM will be measured., 1 year|Margin assessment of positive tumors in NIRF fluorescent-guided surgery, 1 year
Non-invasive preoperative PET imaging evaluation and real-time fluorescence-guided surgery would be of great help in GBM patients. BBN, with the amino acid sequence of Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Leu-Met-NH2, has been extensively used for the development of molecular probes for the imaging of gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR), a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family of bombesin receptors that over-expressed in various types of cancer cells including glioblastoma multiforme. For interests in clinical translation of GRPR targeting dual modality probe, an open label dual modality imaging PET/ NIFR study was designed to investigate the safety and imaging guiding performance of 68Ga-BBN-IRDye800CW in patients with GBM.
