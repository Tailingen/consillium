Comparison Between Conventional and Model-based Infusion Strategy of IV PCA in Patients Undergoing RALP
Comparing postoperative analgesics requirements and complications between conventional and model-based infusion strategy of intravenous patient-controlled analgesia in patients who undergoing robot assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy

Group A: conventional intravenous patient-controlled analgesia, Group B: model-based infusion strategy of intravenous patient-controlled analgesia
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: fentanyl
Amount and number of postoperative analgesic requirements, Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 1 week
Number of participants with complications, Up to 48 hours|Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Up to 48 hours|Postoperative nausea and vomiting, Up to 48 hours|Respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, Up to 48 hours
The investigators compared postoperative analgesics requirements and complications between conventional and model-based infusion strategy of intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV PCA) in patients who undergoing robot assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP)

Group A: conventional IV PCA, Group B: model based IV PCA

1. Primary endpoint: comparison of postoperative analgesic requirements in patient undergoing robot assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) between conventional patient controlled analgesia (PCA) (Group A) and effective-compartment based dosing strategy of PCA (Group B)
2. Secondary endpoint: 1) VAS analysis between two groups, 2) postoperative nausea and vomiting analysis between two groups, 3) complication evaluation between two groups
