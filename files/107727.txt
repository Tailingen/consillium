Effects of Essential Amino Acid Intake on Net Protein Synthesis in Weight-losing Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Patients
Weight loss commonly occurs in lung cancer patients, negatively influencing their quality of life, treatment response and survival. Gains in lean body mass are difficult to achieve in cancer unless specific metabolic abnormalities are targeted. It is our hypothesis that a nutritional supplement containing a high amount of essential amino acids will target the metabolic alterations of cancer patients. Preliminary research performed in our laboratory in elderly supports this hypothesis. We hypothesize that intake of an essential amino acid nutritional supplement will positively influence protein synthesis rate in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Furthermore, insight in the underlying mechanism of the higher anabolic response of the essential amino acid supplement will be examined. This information will potentially enable us to formulate a supplement that is more effective than normal food intake, and that will reduce the need for muscle protein breakdown.

In this study, we will test the following hypothesis: A high-leucine essential amino acid mixture stimulates whole body protein synthesis (and in this way protein anabolism) to a larger extent than a regular balanced mixture of total (essential and non-essential) amino acids in NSCLC patients with and without recent weight loss. The principal endpoint will be the extent of stimulation of protein synthesis rate as this is the principal mechanism by which either amino acid or protein intake causes muscle anabolism. This project will provide important clinical information, based on novel fundamental basic knowledge on the process and the specific underlying mechanisms of muscle wasting in patients with NSCLC, and the role of EAA as a potential anabolic substrate. In this way, it will provide preliminary data for the development of nutritional strategies that will prevent or even stop this process of ongoing muscle loss in NSCLC.
