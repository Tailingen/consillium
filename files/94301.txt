Treatment of Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma With Radiofrequency Ablation
Investigators intend to evaluate the efficiency of Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) therapy to treat papillary thyroid carcinoma.
Papillary Thyroid Cancer|Papillary Thyroid Microcarcinoma
DEVICE: RFA
Changes in Thyroid Nodule Size, Thyroid tumor volume shrinkage will be assessed by ultrasound and compared with pre-procedure volume (measure in mL), 24 months
Pain Related to RFA Procedure, Assessed by number of participants that reported any pain related to RFA procedure, Up to 24 months|Development of Lymph Node Involvement, Assessed by the number of participants with cervical adenopathy (enlargement of lymph nodes in the neck area). Participants will be evaluated during follow-up visits., 18 months|Development of Distant Metastasis, Assessed by the number of participants with distant metastasis if regional neck metastasis is detected on follow up., 18 months|Safety of the RFA Procedure, Assessed by the number of participants who experienced infection, hematoma, bruising, or other complications at the RFA site., Up to 24 months|Change in Thyroid Status, Participants were tracked for thyroid status following radiofrequency ablation, Up to 24 months
Investigators plan to identify patients with small papillary thyroid carcinoma and subject such patients to radiofrequency ablation (RFA) therapy.

Following RFA procedure patients will be monitored to study the changes in primary tumor volume, development of lymph node involvement, development of distant metastasis and changes in serum thyroid hormone levels.

Investigators will also assess the stability of these changes (need for repeat therapy) and the safety of the RFA procedure.
