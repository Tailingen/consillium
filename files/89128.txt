A Study of The Safety Profile of First-line Avastin (Bevacizumab) in Combination With Paclitaxel in Patients With Locally Recurrent or Metastatic Her2-negative Breast Cancer (AVATAX)
This single arm, open label study will assess the safety profile of Avastin (bevacizumab) in combination with paclitaxel as first-line treatment in patients with locally recurrent or metastatic Her2-negative breast cancer. Patients will receive Avastin, either 10 mg/kg intravenously (iv) every 2 weeks or 15 mg/kg iv every 3 weeks. Correspondingly, paclitaxel will be administered at a dose of 90 mg/m2 o days 1, 8 and 15 of every 28-day cycle or 175 mg/m2 on day 1 of every 21-day cycle. Anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.
