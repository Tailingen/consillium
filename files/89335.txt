Treatment With AMD3100 (Plerixafor) in MM Patients to Mobilize PBCs For Collection and for Transplantation
This study will examine whether 240 µg/kg plerixafor given alone for up to 4 days is safe and well tolerated in multiple myeloma (MM) patients. In addition, this study determines if plerixafor alone can be used to mobilize peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) for transplantation in MM patients. The minimum number of CD34+ cells to collect is 2\*10\^6 CD34+ cells/kg and the target is ≧4\*10\^6 CD34+ cells/kg. Success of transplant engraftment will be measured by the number of days to polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) and platelet (PLT) engraftment. Durability of transplant will be assessed for a minimum of one year.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: plerixafor
Number of Participants Who Achieved ≥4*10^6 CD34+ Cells/kg, Number of participants achieving a target of ≥ 4\*10\^6 CD34+ cells/kg during apheresis for up to 4 consecutive days. Apheresis was performed six hours following treatment with plerixafor 240 µg/kg (alone). Target was calculated as the sum of all daily values collected from central laboratory data over up to 4 apheresis days., Day 1 up to day 4|Participant Counts of Summarized Adverse Events (AE) During Treatment, Participant counts of summarized adverse events (AEs) which occurred from the first dose of plerixafor up to the day prior to chemotherapy/ablative treatment. Events were graded according to World Health Organization criteria: Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated), Moderate (discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity), Severe (incapacitating with inability to work or do usual activity)., 1 month
Number of Transplantations That Achieved Polymorphonuclear Leukocyte (PMN) Engraftment Grouped by Days to Engraftment, Polymorphonuclear cell (PMN) engraftment was defined as a PMN count ≥ 0.5\*10\^9/L for 3 consecutive days or ≥ 1\*10\^9/L for 1 day. Days to engraftment corresponded to the first day that the criteria were met after transplantation., Approximately 2 months|Number of Transplantations That Achieved Platelet (PLT) Engraftment Grouped by Days to Engraftment, Platelet (PLT) engraftment was defined as a PLT count of ≥ 20\*10\^9/L for 7 days without transfusion. Days to engraftment corresponded to the first day that the criteria were met after transplantation., Approximately 2 months|Number of Participants With a Durable Graft at 12 Months Post Transplantation, Graft durability was assessed by the Investigator based on complete blood count (CBC) and differential analyses at 12 months post transplantation., Approximately month 13
