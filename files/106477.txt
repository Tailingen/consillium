Neoadjuvant ABI-007, Carboplatin and Gemcitabine in Locally Advanced Bladder Cancer
Study participants will have been diagnosed with bladder cancer that has invaded the muscle wall of the bladder. Surgery is used to remove cancer when it is in the muscle of the bladder. Unfortunately, approximately 50% of people may have their cancer return in another location. For this reason, researchers are focusing on new chemotherapy regimens to be given before surgery (to remove the bladder) that may decrease the likelihood of cancer spreading.

Paclitaxel, carboplatin and gemcitabine are chemotherapy drugs known to destroy bladder cancer cells.

ABI-007 (brand name Abraxane™) is a form of the chemotherapy drug called paclitaxel. Standard paclitaxel is formulated with ethanol and a substance called Cremophor EL (polyoxyethylated castor oil). However, these additives are felt to contribute to the side effects (possibly severe) associated with paclitaxel. ABI-007 does not contain these additives and may deliver more drug to tumor cells. ABI-007 is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the treatment of metastatic (advanced) breast cancer, and is being evaluated in other cancers in research studies.

This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of ABI-007, carboplatin and gemcitabine in the treatment of bladder cancer prior to surgery to remove the bladder.
