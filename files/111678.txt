Treatment for Persistently Fatigued Cancer Survivors: A Randomized Controlled Trial With Biomarker Response
The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) to an attention control psycho-educational support group in treating cancer-related fatigue (CRF) in early-stage (0-III) post-treatment cancer survivors with clinically-significant CRF. The study will collect, store, and later analyze blood and urine samples for several biomarkers that may be linked to persistent CRF in cancer survivors.
Fatigue
BEHAVIORAL: Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction|BEHAVIORAL: Attention Control
Change in cancer-related fatigue functional interference, The Fatigue Symptom Inventory interference subscale will be used to assess the degree to which CRF was judged to interfere with quality of life across seven domains over the previous week., from baseline to 6 month follow-up
Change in cancer-related fatigue severity, The Fatigue Symptom Inventory severity subscale will be used to assess the most, least, and average fatigue in the past week, as well as current fatigue., from baseline to 6 month follow-up|Change in vitality, The Short Form (36) Health Survey Vitality Scale will be used to assess how much during the past 4 weeks the person had a lot of energy, felt full of life, felt worn out, and felt tired., from baseline to 6 month follow-up|Change in depression, The PHQ-8 scale will be used to assess how often the person has been bothered over the previous 2 weeks by symptoms of depression, including little interest or pleasure in doing things and feeling down, depressed, or hopeless., from baseline to 6 month follow-up|Change in anxiety, The GAD-7 scale will be used to assess how often the person has been bothered over the previous 2 weeks by symptoms such as: feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge; not being able to stop or control worrying; and trouble relaxing., from baseline to 6 month follow-up|Change in sleep disturbance, The Insomnia Severity Index will be used to assess the perceived severity of insomnia and the impact of sleep difficulties over the previous 2 weeks., from baseline to 6 month follow-up|Change in pain, The Brief Pain Inventory-3 is a brief pain measure derived from the Brief Pain Inventory. It is also known as the PEG and will be used to assess average pain intensity (P), interference with enjoyment of life (E), and interference with general activity (G) over the past week., from baseline to 6 month follow-up|Change in fear of recurrence, The Concerns About Recurrence Scale will be used to assess overall frequency, potential for upset, consistency, and intensity of recurrence fears., from baseline to 6 month follow-up|Change in attentional function, The Attentional Function Index will be used to assess perceived effectiveness in common activities requiring attention and working memory., from baseline to 6 month follow-up
Change in mindfulness, The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire will be used to assess the five facets of a general tendency to be mindful in daily life- observing, describing, acting with awareness, non-judgment of inner experience, and non-reactivity to inner experience., from baseline to 6 month follow-up|Change in self-compassion, The Self-Compassion Scale-Short Form will be used to assess attitudes associated with self-compassion. The scale includes 3 positive subscales (self-kindness, common humanity, mindfulness) and 3 negative subscales (self-judgement, isolation, and over-identification)., from baseline to 6 month follow-up
This is a randomized, attention control clinical trial to compare MBSR to support and education on biobehavioral outcomes in early-stage (0-III) post-treatment cancer survivors with clinically-significant CRF. The study will use quantitative and qualitative methods to evaluate the following:

Primary Aim 1: Determine effect size estimates of MBSR compared to attention control in reducing fatigue interference and the severity of several cancer-related symptoms immediately post-intervention and at 6-month follow-up.

Exploratory Aim 1: To identify potential moderators of intervention effects in breast cancer survivors (BCS) and colorectal cancer survivors (CRCS), such as demographic, clinical/disease characteristics, personality traits, and baseline mindfulness level.

Exploratory Aim 2: To compare levels of a number of anti- and pro-inflammatory proteins present in blood and urine between MBSR and attention control groups immediately post-intervention and 6-month follow-up, and between fatigued and non-fatigued breast cancer survivors at baseline.
