In Vitro Expanded Allogeneic Epstein-Barr Virus Specific Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes (EBV-CTLs) Genetically Targeted to the CD19 Antigen in B-cell Malignancies
The purpose of this study is to test the safety of giving the patient special cells from a donor called "Modified T-cells". The goal is to assess the toxicities of T-cells for patients with relapsed B cell leukemia or lymphoma after a blood SCT organ SCT or for patients who are at high risk for relapse of their B cell leukemia or lymphoma.
Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia|Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: Biological/Genetically Modified T cells|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy
Evaluate the safety/persistence of (including GVHD) of allogeneic EBV specific CTL modified to express artificial T cell receptors targeting CD19 molecule given for persistence or relapse of B-Cell ALL post allogeneic HSCT., 3 years
To assess the effects of the adoptively transferred CD19 specific T-cells on the progression of leukemia., 3 years|To quantitate the number of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) positive T-cells and donor EBV-CTL in the blood at defined intervals post infusion in order to determine their survival and proliferation in the host., 3 years|To assess long-term status of treated patients, 15 years
