A Phase II Trial to Evaluate the Efficiency and Safety of Serplulimab Plus Chemotherapy as Conversion Therapy in NSCLC
This is a phase II, single-arm study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Serplulimab plus chemotherapy as conversion treatment in patients with stage IIIB-IVA oligometastatic non-small cell lung cancer.
Unresectable Lung Non-Small Cell Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: serplulimab plus chemotherapy as conversion treatment
the rate of NSCLC converting to resectable tumors, the proportion of unresectable NSCLC patients who are converted to being suitable for radical pneumonectomy after 3-4 cycles serplulimab plus chemotherapy, up to 16 weeks|the 1-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate, the proportion of patients who are progression-free after pneumonectomy, up to one year
the rate of R0 resection, the proportion of R0 resection in patients who receive pneumonectomy, immediately after the surgery|Progression-free survival (PFS), The duration from the date of initial treatment to the date of disease progression or death due to any cause, up to five years|Overall survival (OS), The duration from the date of initial treatment to the date of death due to any cause, up to five years|the rate of major pathological response (MPR), the proportion of patients who achieve MRP among those receiving pneumonectomy, up to 16 weeks|the rate of pathological complete response (pCR), the proportion of patients who achieve pCR among those receiving pneumonectomy, up to 16 weeks
This single-arm, open-label, prospective phase II clinical trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Serplulimab plus chemotherapy as conversion treatment in patients with stage IIIB-IVA oligometastatic non-small cell lung cancer.

The primary endpoints were the rate of NSCLC converting to resectable tumors and the 1-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate.The secondary endpoints included the rates of R0 resection, major pathological response (MPR) and pathological complete response (pCR), overall survival (OS) and PFS. Multi-omics analysis will be performed to identify potential biomarkers for treatment response.
