Influence of Tumor Associated Immunity on the Number of Lymph Node Retrieved After Colorectal Cancer Surgery (Preliminary Study)
Hypothesis of this study is that increased immunity of primary tumor affects the increased number of lymph node retrieved. This study investigates whether immunity-related cytokine expression on primary tumor, colonic mucosa, and serum is associated with the number of lymph node retrieved in colorectal cancer patients.
Colorectal Cancer
Association between immune related cytokine and number of lymph nodes retrieved., Immunity related cytokine - IL-12, IFN-r, GM-CSF, IL-4, TNF-a, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TGF-b1, CXCR4, SDF1, HGF, VEGF - expression is assessed using Bioplex assay. Patient serum is taken one day before surgery. Primary tumor and colonic mucosal tissue are taken just after surgery. Bioplex assay is performed after patients' enrollment, 2 months after surgery
