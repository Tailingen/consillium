Radiolabeled Monoclonal Antibody Therapy in Treating Patients With Gastrointestinal Cancer
RATIONALE: Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. This may be an effective treatment for gastrointestinal cancer.

PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of radiolabeled monoclonal antibody therapy in treating patients who have gastrointestinal cancer.
Colorectal Cancer|Esophageal Cancer|Gastric Cancer|Pancreatic Cancer
OTHER: iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody CC49-deltaCH2
OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the biodistribution and biokinetics of iodine I 131-labeled monoclonal antibody CC49-delta CH2 in patients with gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma. II. Determine the human anti-human monoclonal antibody response in patients treated with this drug.

OUTLINE: Patients receive iodine I 131-labeled monoclonal antibody CC49-delta CH2 (131I MOAB CC49-delta CH2) IV over 5-10 minutes on day 0. Patients also receive unlabeled monoclonal antibody CC49-delta CH2 IV over 5 minutes followed by 131I MOAB CC49-delta CH2 IV over 5-10 minutes on day 28. Patients are followed weekly for 4 months and then every 3 months for 1 year.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
