18F-Floretyrosine Expanded Access Program
The aim of this Expanded Access Program (EAP) is to enable the use of 18F-Floretyrosine with positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) or positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance (PET/MR) imaging to noninvasively detect tumor burden or treatment related change to assist in optimal management of patients with glioma.
