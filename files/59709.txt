ACTInium-J591 Radionuclide Therapy in PSMA-Detected Metastatic HOrmone-Sensitive Recurrent Prostate CaNcer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of combining Actinium- J591 with radiation therapy or with androgen deprivation therapy.
Prostate Cancer Metastatic
DRUG: Actinium-J591|RADIATION: Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy|DRUG: Androgen Deprivation Therapy
Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) Rate, A DLT will is defined as a grade 3 or higher hematologic adverse event or a grade 2 or higher non-hematologic adverse event deemed to be at least possibly related to study treatment. Adverse events will be assessed using CTCAE version 5. Patients will be observed for a DLT for 3 months from the second dose of actinium-J591., 24 months|Change in Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), 3,6,12,18 and 24 months.

This is a two cohort pilot study for patients with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer after primary treatment +/- salvage treatment with metastases detected on PSMA-PET scan but equivocal, indeterminate or absent on conventional imaging.

Cohort 1 will have patients with Oligometastatic (low volume, between 1 and 5 metastases) disease and Cohort 2 will have patients with polymetastatic (high volume, â‰¥5 metastases) disease detected via PSMA PET.
