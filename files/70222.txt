4D-CT for Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma in Radiotherapy Simulation
The primary objective is to study the feasibility and efficacy of individually optimized CE 4D-CT for PDA in radiotherapy simulation.
Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
OTHER: Contrast-enhanced 4D computed tomography
Individually Optimized Contrast-enhanced 4DCT for Radiotherapy Simulation, Image quality (anatomic details, motion artifacts, beam hardening and enhancement of pancreatic tissue and tumor were scored from 1 to 5, with 1 being very poor and 5 being excellent), CT number of pancreas and tumor, tumor-to-pancreas contrast, image noise and contrast-to-noise ration (CNR) were compared among contrast-enhanced (CE) 4DCT, CE 3DCT and 4DCT without contrast enhancement., 1 year
Compared with current clinical practice, the individually optimized CE 4D-CT can potentially provide much improved tumor-to-parenchyma conspicuity of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. This will help the radiation oncologists or radiologists to contour the tumor with higher precision and confidence, and compute the tumor volume and tumor motion more accurately.
