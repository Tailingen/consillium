A Phase 1 Study Evaluating the Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy of AMG 119 in Subjects With RR SCLC
A study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AMG 119 in adult subjects with Relapsed/Refractory Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) and determine the appropriate cell dose.

This is a phase 1, first-in-human study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AMG 119, an investigational, Chimeric Antigen Receptor T cell therapy targeting delta-like protein 3 (DLL3) in subjects with relapsed/refractory small cell lung cancer who progressed after at least 1 platinum based chemotherapy regimen.
