S1316, Surgery or Non-Surgical Management in Treating Patients With Intra-Abdominal Cancer and Bowel Obstruction
This partially randomized clinical trial studies surgery or non-surgical management in treating patients with intra-abdominal cancer and bowel obstruction. Bowel obstruction is a common problem for advanced cancer patients and can negatively affect quality of life. It is not yet known whether surgery or non-surgical management is the best treatment option for bowel obstruction and can lead to better quality of life.

PROCEDURE: therapeutic conventional surgery|PROCEDURE: gastrointestinal complications management/prevention|OTHER: quality-of-life assessment
Number of Days Alive and Outside of the Hospital, Number of days alive and outside of the hospital, From date of registration up to 91 days
Number of Days in Hospital, Length of initial hospital stay in days., During initial hospitalization, from date of registration to a maximum of 53 weeks post registration|NG Tube Use, Use of a nasogastric tube, During initial hospitalization, from date of registration to a maximum of 53 weeks post registration|Days of NG Tube Use, Number of days a nasogastric tube was used during the patient's initial hospitalization, During entire initial hospitalization (admission to discharge) to a maximum of 53 weeks post registration|MDASI-GI Symptom Assessment, The MD Anderson Symptom Inventory for gastrointestinal cancer (MDASI-GI) was used to assess nausea, vomiting, pain, bloating, and constipation. The MDASI measures symptom severity on an 11-point scale, from 0 ("not present") to 10 ("as bad as you can imagine"). A difference of at least 1.2 points was considered a clinically meaningful difference between groups for MDASI-GI outcomes., Assessed at 4 weeks post registration|Ability to Eat, Ability to consume food was assessed based on self or caregiver-reported 24-hour dietary recalls. Dietary recalls were collected by trained assessors at the University of Arizona Cancer Center Behavioral Measurement and Interventions Shared Resource (BMISR) via telephone using standardized protocols and Nutrient Database for Research., Assessed at 5 weeks post registration|Overall Survival, Time from date of registration to date of death due to any cause., From date of registration to maximum of 53 weeks
