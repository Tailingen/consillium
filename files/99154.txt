A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Pharmacokinetics ABBV-399 in Japanese Participants With Solid Tumors
An open-label, dose-escalation study designed to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of ABBV-399 in participants with advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumors Cancer
DRUG: ABBV-399
Area under the curve (AUC) from time zero to the last measurable concentration AUC (0-t), AUC (0-t) is defined as area under the concentration versus time curve from time zero (pre-dose) to the time of the last measurable concentration., Up to 24 months|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) or maximally administered dose (MAD) for ABBV-399, MTD/MAD is defined as the highest dose level at which less than 2 of 6 (or \< 33% if cohort is expanded beyond 6) participants experience a dose limiting toxicity., Up to 21 days|Terminal elimination half life (t1/2), Terminal elimination half life (t1/2), Up to 24 months|Maximum Observed Concentration (Cmax), Maximum observed concentration (Cmax), Up to 24 months|Time to Cmax (Tmax), Time to Cmax (Tmax), Up to 24 months
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Time, PFS time is defined as the time from the participant's first dose of ABBV-399 to either the participant's disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., Up to 24 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of participants with a confirmed partial or complete response to the treatment. Evaluation of tumor response is based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1., Up to 24 months|Duration of response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the participant's initial objective response to study drug therapy to disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., Up to 24 months
