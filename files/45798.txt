Hypofractionated Proton Radiation Therapy for Low and Intermediate Risk Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this trial is to give a shorter course (5 ½-6 weeks) of proton radiation that has as little side effects on normal bladder and rectal tissues as the usual longer course (8 weeks) of proton radiation, without decreasing the chance of killing prostate cancer cells.
