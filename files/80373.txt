Evaluation of Cirrhosis and Malignant Hepatic Lesions Using Novel MR Contrast Agents
This study aims to determine whether or not gadoxetate disodium (Eovist) enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has a higher sensitivity for detecting hepatocellular carcinoma (Liver Cancer) comparison to multi-detector computed tomography (CT).
