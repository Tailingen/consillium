Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) in Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This is a single-arm phase II trial of Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) in patients with advanced, unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. The primary objective is to assess its therapeutic efficacy in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Disease Control Rate (DCR) in Study Participants, Disease control rate (DCR) will be calculated per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria, as the percentage of patients with best overall response to protocol therapy of either complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) that is maintained for at least 8 weeks.

Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Sold Tumors Criteria (RECISTv1.1)for target lesions and assessed by MRI or CT: Complete response(CR),Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial response(PR),\>=30% decrease in sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR, 8 weeks|Number of Participants With Treatment-Related Adverse Events, The safety of Pembrolizumab in HCC patients as measured by the incidence of treatment-related adverse events, including serious adverse events (SAEs), in study participants using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03, per physician discretion. The number of participants experiencing toxicity attributed by treating physician as definitely, probably and possibly-related to study treatment will be reported., Up to 2 years
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) will be defined as the elapsed time from the first date of study treatment until documented disease progression (as per RECIST 1.1) or death from any cause, whichever is earlier. For patients who remain alive without progression, follow-up time will be censored at the date of last disease assessment ., Up to 25 months|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) will be defined as the elapsed time from the enrollment to death from any cause. For surviving patients, follow-up will be censored at the date of last contact (or last date known to be alive)., Up to 25 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective response rate (ORR) will be defined as the percentage of the patients with a confirmed complete or partial response (CR or PR),by MRI or CT scan as per RECIST 1.1 criteria. Complete response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial response (PR), \>=30% decrease in sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall response (OR) = (CR+PR.)Scans and assessments are performed every 9 weeks while on treatment up to 2 years if stable/responding, or up until time of disease progression., Up to 2 years|Duration of Response (DoR), Duration of Response (DoR) will be defined as the elapsed time from documented tumor response to documented disease progression., Up to 3 Years
