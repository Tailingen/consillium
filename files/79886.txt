A Study of Atezolizumab Compared With Docetaxel in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) After Failure With Platinum-Containing Chemotherapy
This Phase III, multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody atezolizumab compared with docetaxel in participants with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who have progressed during or following a platinum-containing regimen. Treatment may continue until disease progression, loss of clinical benefit, or unacceptable toxicity.
