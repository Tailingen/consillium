Intraperitoneal MCY-M11 (Mesothelin-targeting CAR) for Treatment of Advanced Ovarian Cancer and Peritoneal Mesothelioma
This is a phase 1 dose escalation study to characterize the feasibility, safety and tolerability of MCY-M11 when administered as an intraperitoneal (IP) infusion for 3 weekly doses for women with platinum resistant high grade serous adenocarcinoma of the ovary, primary peritoneum, or fallopian tube, and subjects with peritoneal mesothelioma with recurrence after prior chemotherapy. The study will also assess multiple cycles of treatment and adding preconditioning with cyclophosphamide.
