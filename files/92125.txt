Physical Activity and Nutrition to Halt Elevated Risk in the Pancreas Interception Center
The purpose of this Study is to assist in implementing a practical, easy-to-adopt lifestyle intervention that optimizes patient outcomes and minimizes pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) risk.
Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma|Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasm
BEHAVIORAL: Physical Activity (PA)|BEHAVIORAL: Nutrition (N)
Retention Feasibility, Retention feasibility will be measured based on the percentage of enrolled participants who complete study assessments during the 6-month duration of enrollment (baseline T0 through follow-up T1) Target: ≥70%)., Up to 6 Months|Physical Activity (PA) Adherence Feasibility, Adherence to Physical Activity (PA) will be based on achievement of activity minute goals (≥ 150 minutes).

Target: 70% of participants achieve activity minute goals in ≥75% of full weeks between baseline through follow-up (T0-T1)., Up to 6 Months|Nutrition (N) Adherence Feasibility, Adherence to Nutrition (N) will be based on completion of counseling appointments (target: 70% of participants complete both appointments) and diet logging.

Target: 70% of participants log diet on ≥ 50% of days between baseline through follow-up (T0-T1), Up to 6 Months|Acceptability of Lifestyle Modifications, Acceptability will be assessed at T1 with the Participant Evaluation of Feasibility and Acceptability questionnaire, adapted to fit intervention conditions used in this study.

This questionnaire includes Likert Scale and open-ended questions assessing difficulty and appropriateness of the Physical Acitivity (PA) and Nutrition (N) intervention components, perceived benefits, interactions with study personnel, study materials, and baseline/follow-up testing. Acceptability will be assessed on an item-by-item basis and as average item score, with scores ≥4 ("agree" to "strongly agree") indicating acceptability., Up to 6 Months
