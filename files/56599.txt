Stereotactic Radiotherapy Plus Temozolomide for Refractory Brain Metastases
This clinical trial was designed to investigate the efficiency and toxicity of fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy(FSRT) combined with Temozolomide(TMZ) for refractory brain metastases.
Brain Metastases
RADIATION: Fractionated Stereotactic Radiotherapy|DRUG: Temozolomide
intracranial progress free survival rate, defined as no progress of the treated lesions and no distant progress in the brain, up to 2 years
Overall survival rate, up to 3 year|progress free survival rate, up to 1 year|local control rate, up to 1 year|disease control rate (DCR), Using RTOG9508 criteria, Tumor control is defined as CR+PR+SD, 2-3 months after radiation|adverse event, assessed by CTCAE criteria, v4.0 and RTOG criteria of the central nervous system, from the day of radiation to the end of adjuvant TMZ，up to 6 months|causes of death, collect the data of causes of death and analyze, from the day of radiation to death date, up to 5 years
This is a single-arm, single center, phase II trial to investigate the feasibility and toxicity of FSRT plus TMZ for refractory brain metastases, which are defined as A: multiple brain metastases(≥3 lesions); B: large brain metastases(with one lesion's volume is no smaller than 6cc or the longest diameter is no shorter than 3cm); C: meningeal metastases.
