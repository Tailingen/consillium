A Study to Evaluate ICP-022 in Patients With R/R Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL)
The phase I/II clinical study is to investigate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics/ pharmacodynamics of ICP-022.
Mantle Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: ICP-022
overall response rate (ORR), The efficacy measured by overall response rate (ORR) in Part II according to the 2014 International Working Group NHL, Up to 3 years
Occurrence of adverse events and serious adverse events according to NCI-CTCAE 4.03 grading criteria in Part I, The safety of ICP-022 measured by the occurrence of adverse events and serious adverse events according to NCI-CTCAE 4.03 grading criteria in Part I, Up to 3 years|time to progression (TTP), The efficacy measured by time to progression (TTP) in Part II, Up to 3 years|progression free survival (PFS), The efficacy measured by progression free survival (PFS) in Part II, Up to 3 years|overall survival (OS), The efficacy measured by overall survival (OS) in Part II, Up to 3 years|Area under the concentration time curve up to the time "t" (AUC(0-t)), Area under the concentration time curve up to the time "t" (AUC(0-t)) of ICP-022 will be measured and calculated with noncompartmental analysis using WinNonlin., up to 4 weeks|The percent of target occupancy, PBMC from individual subject before and after dosing will be collected and the target occupancy will be determined by ELISA. The percent of target occupancy will be compared descriptively., up to 4 weeks|Maximum plasma drug concentrations (Cmax), Individual plasma concentrations of ICP-022 will be measured and Cmax will be calculated with noncompartmental analysis using WinNonlin., up to 4 weeks|Time of maximum plasma drug concentrations (Tmax), Time of maximum plasma drug concentrations (Tmax) of ICP-022 will be recorded., up to 4 weeks|Apparent half-life for designated elimination phases (t½), Apparent half-life for designated elimination phases (t½) of ICP-022 will be measured and calculated with noncompartmental analysis using WinNonlin., up to 4 weeks|Area under the concentration time curve up to the last data point above LOQ (AUC(last)), Area under the concentration time curve up to the last data point above LOQ (AUC(last)) of ICP-022 will be measured and calculated with noncompartmental analysis using WinNonlin., up to 4 weeks
Part I: PK/PD and safety evaluation -Two regimens of ICP-022 (High dose QD and low dose BID) were designed for assessment of safety, as well as PK/PD profiles. The recommended dose of phase II clinical study will be determined according to the Part I results.

Part II: Dose expansion -Anti-tumor effects of ICP-022 in Chinese patients with R/R MCL will be evaluated in approximately 80 subjects. The recommended Phase 2 dose will be used in the Part II.
