A Trial of Surgery and Fractionated Re-Irradiation for Recurrent Ependymoma
The primary purpose of this study is to investigate whether surgery and re-irradiation will help treat ependymoma that has come back after initial treatment. The combined doses of the first and second courses of radiation are higher than what is usual standard of care. The investigators will study the effects and side effects of surgery and re-irradiation. They will also evaluate and study tumor tissue and blood to learn more about the tumor and how it does or does not respond to treatments and will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) scans to see if they can predict tumor response and tumor recurrence.

Participants will be followed for up to 5 years following enrollment. Evaluations during radiation therapy will be done weekly while receiving therapy for up to 7 weeks. Other evaluations will be done at enrollment, every 4 months from enrollment through 3 years, and every 6 months during the 4th and 5th year.
