BEHAVIORAL: AIM materials and assessments
Develop and refine materials (iThrive and iTrack), This will involve development of a mobile app-based intervention program (based on our results from Phase 1 and 2 and preliminary work conducted by Beard et al.) that targets fear of cancer recurrence for breast, rare gynecological, rare melanoma and skin, long-term adult pediatric, and other rare cancer survivors., 1 year
Determine feasibility, usability, acceptability, We will evaluate three versions of the app-based intervention program (iThrive 8, iThrive 16, and iTrack) in BCS (n=30) and RCS (n=90). This will allow us to assess the feasibility of the research procedures, the appropriateness of the psychological and physiological outcome measures, preliminary estimates of pre- and post-intervention effect sizes and reliable change estimates, and variables associated with any observed outcomes., 1 year|Preliminary Efficacy, We will evaluate three versions of the app-based intervention program (iThrive 8, iThrive 16, and iTrack) in BCS (n=30) and RCS (n=90).
