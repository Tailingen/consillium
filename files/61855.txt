A Study of CF33-hNIS (VAXINIA), an Oncolytic Virus, as Monotherapy or in Combination With Pembrolizumab in Adults With Metastatic or Advanced Solid Tumors
This is an open-label, dose-escalation, multi-center phase I study evaluating the safety of CF33-hNIS (hNIS - human sodium iodide symporter) administered via two routes of administration, intratumoral (IT) or intravenous (IV), either as a monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab or mFOLFOX in patients with metastatic or advanced solid tumors.

BIOLOGICAL: CF33-hNIS|BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Modified FOLFOX
Frequency and severity of Adverse Events of IV and IT CF33-hNIS as a monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab, Adverse events will be graded according to CTCAE v5.0., From first dose of study drug through 30 days following the last dose of study treatment.|Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of CF33-hNIS as a monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab, RP2D determination will be based on evaluation of Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT) as well as other safety, efficacy and correlative data., From first dose of study drug through 21-42 days following the first dose of study treatment.
Objective Response Rate (ORR) of CF33-hNIS administered as a monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab or modified FOLFOX, ORR is defined as the proportion of patients in the efficacy population who achieve a radiographic Investigator-assessed confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), per RECIST v1.1 or confirmed immune complete response (iCR) or immune partial response (iPR) per iRECIST v1.0., Up to 2 years from first dose of study drug.|Progression-free survival (PFS) of CF33-hNIS administered as a monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab or modified FOLFOX, PFS, defined as the time from start of treatment to the first documentation of progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 2 years from first dose of study drug.|Overall survival (OS) of CF33-hNIS administered as a monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab or modified FOLFOX, defined as the time from the start of treatment until death due to any cause. Median OS and OS rate at 12 months will be reported., Up to 2 years from first dose of study drug.|Duration of Response (DOR) of CF33-hNIS administered as a monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab or modified FOLFOX, DOR is defined as the time from the date a response of PR/iPR or better was first recorded to the date on which progressive disease was first noted or the date of death due to any cause., Up to 2 years from first dose of study drug.|Disease Control Rate (DCR) of CF33-hNIS administered as a monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab or modified FOLFOX, DCR is defined as the proportion of patients who achieve an Investigator-assessed confirmed CR/iCR, PR/iPR, or Stable Disease (SD)/immune SD (iSD) per RECIST v1.1 and iRECIST v1.0., Up to 2 years from first dose of study drug.|To evaluate viral titers of CF33-hNIS, Viral Plaque Assay (VPA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing from serum, urine, oral swab, rectal swab, injection site(s) swab and wound dressing swab., Up to 2 years from first dose of study drug.|To evaluate infection of tumors with CF33-hNIS, hNIS-based imaging via SPECT technetium-99 (99TC)., 21 days from first dose of study drug
To evaluate antiviral immune activation, Up regulation of PD-L1 expression as compared to baseline in tumor tissue and circulating tumor cells (CTC).

Analysis of lymphocyte subsets and cytokine profile compared to baseline., Up to 2 years from first dose of study drug.
CF33-hNIS, a novel chimeric orthopoxvirus, will be administered as a monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab or mFOLFOX to assess the safety and efficacy of the treatment regimens as well as immunological changes in the tumour microenvironment.

Patients eligible for treatment in dose escalation IT/IV cohorts include those with any metastatic or advanced solid tumor who have documented radiological progression per RECIST following at least two prior lines of therapy which may have included treatment with an Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor(ICI). For expansion IT and IV cholangiocarcinoma cohort patients, one prior line of systemic chemotherapy in metastatic/advanced setting is required and for patients with targetable tumor mutations, must have also received 1 line of an approved targeted therapy. For expansion IV cholangiocarcinoma cohort, prior treatment with leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil, or oxaliplatin is not permitted.

For IT/IV cohorts, patients will be treated with CF33-hNIS on Day 1 and 8 of Cycle 1 and then on Day 1 of each cycle thereafter. Patients treated with the combination regimen with pembrolizumab will also receive pembrolizumab Day 1 of each cycle beginning with Cycle 2.

For IV cholangiocarcinoma expansion cohort, patients will be treated with CF33-hNIS on Day 3 and Day 17 of each 28 day cycle along with a modified FOLFOX regimen.
