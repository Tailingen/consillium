A Study of Furmonertinib Combined With Radiotherapy for Non-small Cell Lung Cancer With Oligoprogression
This Phase II randomized study is to explore the efficacy and safety of Furmonertinib combined with radiotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer with oligoprogression after first-line EGFR-TKI therapy.

progression-free survival, From the first day of treatment to the day of progression or the day of death., 2-year
Overall survival, It was calculated from the first day of treatment to the day of death., 2-year|Failure pattern, Disease progression such as local recurrence or distant metastasis., 2-year|Safety evaluation, Adverse effects are graded according to the CTCAE 5.0 version, including multiple organs and tissues, such as gastrointestinal disease and symptom, cardiovascular disease, respiratory diseases and so on., 2 year after therapy
This Phase II randomized study is to explore the efficacy and safety of Furmonertinib combined with radiotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer with oligoprogression after first-line EGFR-TKI therapy.

The first group will enroll NSCLC patients with oligoprogression after using the first/second generation EGFR-TKI. The participants will receive Furmonertinib 80mg and local radiotherapy as the following therapy.

The other group will enroll NSCLC patients with oligoprogression after using the third generation EGFR-TKI. The participants will receive Furmonertinib 160mg and local radiotherapy as the following therapy.
