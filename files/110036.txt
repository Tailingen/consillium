Comparison of the Vocal Cord Imaging Techniques After Thyroidectomy
Recurrent nerve palsy is a complication of thyroidectomy. Most surgeons want to visualize the vocal cords after tyroidectomy. The aim is to compare the direct laringoscopy, videolaringoscopy, fiberoptic laringoscopy and ultrasonography methods in terms of efficacy, duration and hemodynamic responses during the procedure.
Thyroid Nodule
DEVICE: direct laringoscopy|DEVICE: fiberoptic nasal laringoscopy|DEVICE: ultrasonograph
visualisation of the vocal cords, the vocal cords will be examined after extubation, 1 min after extubation|duration of the procedure, the duration of the vocal cord examination, 10 min after extubation|mean arterial pressure, the mean arterial pressure will be measured after extubation, 10 min after extubation|heart rate, the heart rate will be measured after extubation, 10 min after extubation|peripheal oxygen saturation, the peripheal oxygen saturation will be measured after extubation, 10 min after extubation
hypertention, mean arterial pressure \>20% from baseline value, 5 minutes after the extubation|tachycardia, heart rate \>20% from baseline value, 5 minutes after the extubation|laceration, blood detected on the blade/fiber optic scope, or macroscopic blood on the oral nasal mucosa, 5 minutes after the extubation|teeht damage, broken teeht, 5 minutes after the extubation
The vocal cord will be visualised after the extubation with one of the following methods:

direct laringoscopy videolaringoscopy fiberoptic laringoscopy ultrasonography The of efficacy of the method (0= not able to visualize the vocal cords, 1= the vocal cords were visualized) duration of the procedure and hemodynamic responses (heart rate, mean arterial pressure) during the procedure will be compared between the groups.
