Deferasirox in Treating Patients With Iron Overload After Undergoing a Donor Stem Cell Transplant
RATIONALE: Deferasirox may be effective in treating iron overload caused by blood transfusions in patients who have undergone donor stem cell transplant.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well deferasirox works in treating patients with iron overload after donor stem cell transplant.

DRUG: deferasirox
Number of Patients Not Completing Treatment, Number of patients who discontinued deferasirox during 6 month daily treatment due to drug related toxicity, 6 Months
Reduction in Liver Iron Concentration After Study Drug, Efficacy as measured by reduction in liver iron concentration (LIC) after 6 months of the study drug compared to baseline (LIC at baseline minus LIC at 6 months). This shows the mean reduction for the 3 subjects treated in this study., 6 Months
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To evaluate the safety of deferasirox given over 6 months in reducing liver iron concentration in patients with transfusional iron overload after undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

Secondary

* To evaluate the efficacy of deferasirox in reducing liver iron overload in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive oral deferasirox once daily for 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 4 weeks.
