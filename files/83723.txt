Evaluation of the Efficacy of Digital Breast Tomosynthesis Imaging
The primary objective of this protocol is to collect the 2-dimensional (2D) screening and diagnostic images, and 3-dimensional (3D) Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) scans from patient mammography examinations acquired on various commercially available Full Field Digital Mammography (FFDM) systems and the Siemens Inspiration DBT system, respectively.

Efficacy Based on the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve in Breasts Analyzed With DBT as an Adjunct to FFDM vs. FFDM Alone, The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate the superiority of DBT and FFDM images together in comparison to FFDM images alone with respect to the ability of readers to detect and diagnose malignant lesions. A comparison of the breast-level ROC areas was used to evaluate the superiority of DBT as an adjunct to FFDM vs. FFDM alone., 1 year
The image collection includes FFDM images and both raw and presentation data from the DBT system. The FFDM mammograms are performed using standard care screening or diagnostic mammography from various commercially available FFDM systems. All DBT images are acquired on the Inspiration DBT system specifically for the study, in addition to the clinically indicated screening mammograms. DBT images are read at the clinical sites and any DBT findings were investigated according to standard care.
