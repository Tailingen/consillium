Patient Reported Outcomes/Metrics Program Trial
This is an observational study to investigate if it is feasible to recruit 100 patients receiving radiotherapy (RT) to metastatic disease to wear Hexoskin and if Hexoskin will facilitate the monitoring, detection and early treatment of RT-related side effects.
Metastatic Cancer|Palliative
DEVICE: Hexoskin Medical System

(100 is the best health a patient can imagine while 0 is the worst health a patient can imgaine.), Baseline to 12 months|Health Related Quality of Life (QOL), Perform Health Related Quality of Life using EORTC QLQ-C30 and rate electronic survey completion., Baseline to 12 months|Number of Trial Refusals, Evaluate reasons for trial refusal, Baseline to 12 months|Complete follow-ups, Rate of completed follow-ups, Baseline to 12 months|Patient experience and satisfaction, Measure patient experience and satisfaction using mobile app (Zamplo) and Hexoskin, Baseline to 12 months|Patient Adherence, Patient adherence to using the Hexoskin Medical System, Baseline to 12 months|Hexoskin data collection rates, Feasibility of data collection using the Hexoskin Medical System, Baseline to 12 months|Quality of Life (QOL) survey completion, Rate of Quality of Life (QOL) survey completion on mobile app (Zamplo), Baseline to 12 months|Overall survival of participants, Overall survival time is calculated from study enrollment to date of death or last follow-up, Baseline to 12 months|Characterize adverse event profile, Characterize adverse event profile of various radiotherapy regimens given for metastases, Baseline to 12 months
Radiotherapy is an important adjunct in the interdisciplinary care of the palliative patient population, providing the potential for improved quality of life and symptom control, often translating into improved well-being, function and mobility. Changes in pain and QOL are frequently measured subjectively using patient-reported questionnaires. Objective measures such as respiratory rate, pulse rate, activity level and sleep duration and quality, may complement the currently available tools. Such tools may lead to better evaluation of the effects of palliative RT with real-time detection of potential complications and toxicity and the acute need for analgesic adjustments that can result from successful palliative RT.
