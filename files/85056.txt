Molecular Predictors of Pemetrexed and Carboplatin Response in Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM) Patients
The aim of the present study is to investigate the molecular predictors of pemetrexed and carboplatin response in tumor samples of a series of MPM patients extracting the DNA and genotyping for the TSER polymorphism.
MALIGNANT PLEURAL MESOTHELIOMA
Evaluate the expression and allelic variants of a panel of candidate genes involved in the resistance to drugs, the genome wide copy number changes in patients treated with drugs combination in the first line, one year
Evaluate retrospectively the correlation between gene expression and polymorphisms in candidate genes and array-CGH data, immunohistochemistry data, and clinical data., one year
Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive tumor that usually has a poor prognosis. The combination of cisplatin and pemetrexed has recently become the standard of care in the first-line treatment of MPM. For patients who are unfit to receive a cisplatin-based chemotherapy, pemetrexed alone \[7\] or combined with carboplatin \[8\] has been proposed as an alternative treatment choice. The identification of molecular predictors of effective therapy is important for maximizing therapeutic efficacy and minimizing useless treatment in cancer patients.
