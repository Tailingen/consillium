Effectiveness of ERAS on Postoperative Recovery After Minimally Invasive Gastrectomy
This prospective, randomized, open-label, multicenter study is designed to evaluate the impact of an enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocol on the rate of meeting discharge criteria in patients undergoing minimally-invasive gastrectomy for gastric cancer. We hypothesize that implementation of our ERAS protocol will significantly increase the proportion of patients who meet standardized discharge criteria following minimally-invasive gastrectomy.
Enhanced Recovery After Surgery|Gastrectomy for Gastric Cancer
PROCEDURE: ERAS protocol
Proportion of patients who fulfilled all of the predefined discharge criteria, Discharge criteria were defined as meeting all of the following conditions:

* Tolerance of a soft blended diet (SBD) for at least 24 hours
* Unaided ambulation of at least 600 meters
* Adequate pain control, defined as a numeric rating scale (NRS) score of â‰¤ 3, achieved with oral non-opioid analgesics
* Absence of abnormal physical examination findings or laboratory test results, At 9:00 AM on postoperative day
Postoperative pain score, 11-pointed NRS pain score at resting/coughing NRS (0-10): 0,"no pain"; 10, "worst pain imaginable", postoperative 2, 24, 48, and 72 hours|Postoperative gastrointestinal dysfunction, I-FEED score 3 points or more (postoperative gastrointestinal intolerance and dysfunction), postoperative 24, 48, and 72 hours|Postoperative nausea and vomiting, Incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (%), From the end of surgery to 24, 48, and 72 hours postoperatively|Quality of recovery assessed using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire, EQ-5D-5L index scores are calculated from the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire using the Korean value set validated for the Korean population. (range: 0 to 1.000, with higher scores indicating better recovery) (Kim SH, Ahn J, Ock M, et al. The EQ-5D-5L valuation study in Korea. Qual Life Res. 2016; 25: 1845-1852), postoperative 24, 48, and 72 hours|Major postoperative complication, Major postoperative complications are defined as events classified as Clavien-Dindo grade IIIa or higher and are assessed based on their incidence within 30 days after surgery., At 30 days postoperatively
Adult patients undergoing elective minimally invasive gastrectomy were randomly allocated to receive either the ERAS protocol (n = 154) or the conventional protocol (n = 154). The conventional group received the current standard perioperative care at our institution, whereas the ERAS group received a newly developed ERAS protocol, which included preoperative carbohydrate loading, reduced perioperative fasting duration, and multimodal opioid-sparing analgesia. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who met standardized discharge criteria at 9:00 AM on postoperative day 4. Secondary outcomes included the EQ-5D-5L index assessed at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours postoperatively; pain intensity at rest and during coughing measured using an 11-point numeric rating scale at 2, 24, 48, and 72 hours postoperatively; gastrointestinal dysfunction assessed using the I-FEED score at 24, 48, and 72 hours postoperatively; the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting within 0-24, 24-48, and 48-72 hours after surgery; the incidence of major postoperative complications classified by the Clavien-Dindo grading system during hospitalization; and postoperative length of hospital stay.
