Radiomics and Radiogenomics of Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
In this study, the radiomic characteristics and a broad range of genetic aberrations in lung adenocarcinomas will be evaluated. Investigators will assess changes in the radiomic and genetic profiles during targeted therapies in a subset of patients harboring treatable mutations. Patients undergoing targeted therapies will also be evaluated for variations in genomic profile and radiomic signature during follow-up

Non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) are the first cause of cancer-related deaths.

Recent guidelines suggest the key role of a wide molecular profile because knowledge of the tumor genotype can enable patients with NSCLC to be treated with targeted therapies.

In this study, a first group of patients with lung adenocarcinoma (study group), tested for the presence of genetic alterations in EGFR, ALK, and KRAS, and with available Computer Tomography (CT) scans, will be evaluated to create a radiomic signature and assess its association with mutational status and prognosis.

Then, a second group of patients (validation group) will be enrolled to validate the radiomic signature and the status of the genetic alterations and their association with prognosis. Radiomic signature and liquid biopsies will be evaluated in patients positive for genetic alterations at each follow-up step to verify their association with prognosis and response to targeted therapies.
