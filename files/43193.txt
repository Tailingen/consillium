These includes five functional scales (physical functioning \[PF\], role functioning \[RF\], cognitive functioning \[CF\], emotional functioning \[EF\] and social functioning \[SF\]), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain and nausea/vomiting \[N/V\]), a global health status (GHS)/ Quality-of-Life (QoL) scale, and six single items (constipation, diarrhoea, insomnia, dyspnoea, appetite loss \[AL\] and financial difficulties \[FD\]). Response options are 1 to 4. Scores are averaged and transformed to 0 to 100, a high score for functional scales/ GHS/QoL represents better functioning ability or health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL), whereas a high score for symptom scales/ single items represents significant symptomatology.

The individual component scores in the disease symptom domain are averaged and transformed linearly to a score ranging from 0 to100. A high score for disease symptoms represents a high level of symptomatology or problems. A high score for Future Perspective and Body Image represents a high/healthy level of functioning., Up to approximately 473 weeks|Change From Baseline in HRQoL as Measured by EORTC IL52, The EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire 20-item Multiple Myeloma module (QLQMY20) is a supplement to the QLQ-C30 instrument used in participants with multiple myeloma.

The individual component scores in the disease symptom domain are averaged and transformed linearly to a score ranging from 0 to100. A high score for disease symptoms represents a high level of symptomatology or problems.
