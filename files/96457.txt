Study to Evaluate Maximum Tolerated Dose of Oral CB-03-10 With Dose Expansion Phase, in Advanced Solid Tumors
Subjects will undergo baseline evaluation and an assessment of extent of disease.

Subjects in Part 1 (Dose Escalation) will receive escalating doses of CB-03-10 based on a modified Fibonacci schema using a standard oncology 3+3 study design to define an MTD and a RP2D. Plasma PK samples will be collected at predetermined timepoints for all subjects.

Subjects in Part 2 (Dose Expansion) of the study will receive CB-03-10 at the RP2D determined in the Part 1 of the study. The indications included in each group will be determined at the completion of Part 1 of the study by Safety Review Committee (SRC).

Subjects will be evaluated weekly initially (for 2 cycles in Part 1 and for 1 cycle in Part 2) and every 2 weeks thereafter. Reassessment of disease will be conducted at Week 8 and every 8 weeks thereafter. Subjects with evidence of response (partial or complete) will be re-evaluated at least 4 weeks later for confirmation.
