Assess Safety & Efficacy of Selumetinib When Given in Combination With Standard First Line Treatment for Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a Phase I, open label multicentre study of selumetinib administered orally in combination with first line chemotherapy regimens to patients with advanced/metastatic NSCLC. The study has been designed to allow an investigation of the optimal dose of selumetinib in combination with various standard first line double-platinum chemotherapy regimens. Initial assessment will be based on tolerability of selumetinib in combination with one or more selected regimens that are considered to be tolerated also being assessed for preliminary evidence of activity.

This study is a dose finding and optional cohort expansion; In addition all patients will be assessed for anti-cancer efficacy of the combination of selumetinib and chemotherapy.
Locally Advanced or Metastatic NSCL Cancer Stage IIIB IV
DRUG: selumetinib|DRUG: gemcitabine|DRUG: cisplatin|DRUG: carboplatin|DRUG: pemetrexed
Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) Events in Chemotherapy in Combination With Selumetinib, Any toxicity not attributable to the disease or disease-related processess under investigation, considered related to the combination of chemotherapy plus selumetinib, which occurs within the timeframe and is dose limiting, The first dose on Cycle 1 Day 1 up to the time before dosing on Cycle 2 Day 1, assessed up to 3 weeks
Best Objective Response, The best response a patient has had during their time in the study up until RECIST progression or last valuable assessment in the absence of RECIST progression. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST version 1.1) for target lesions (TL) and assessed by MRI or CT: Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD), neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for a Partial Response nor sufficient increase to qualify for Progressive Disease (PD); Progressive Disease (PD), \>=20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of \>=5mm; Complete Response (CR), disappearance of all target lesions, any pathological lymph nodes selected as TLs must have a reduction in short axis to \<10mm, Screening, week 6 and week 12|Percentage Change From Baseline at 6 Weeks in Target Lesion Size, The percentage change in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, Week 6|Best Percentage Change From Baseline in Target Lesion Size, The best percentage change in tumour size a patient has had during their time in the study up until RECIST progression or last valuable assessment in the absence of RECIST progression. Percentage change was derived at each visit by the percentage change in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, Screening, week 6 and week 12|Objective Response Rate (ORR), The number of patients who had at least 1 confirmed visit response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) prior to any evidence of progression. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST version 1.1) for target lesions (TL) and assessed by MRI or CT: Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Complete Response (CR), disappearance of all target lesions, any pathological lymph nodes selected as TLs must have a reduction in short axis to \<10mm; Objective Response Rate (ORR) = CR + PR, Up until progression or last evaluable assessment in the absence of progression, up to 9 months|AUC (0-tau), Area under the concentration time curve (AUC) over a dosing interval at steady state (0-tau), Cycle 2 Day1, pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 8, 10 hours post dose|Cmax,ss, Maximum plasma concentration at steady state, Cycle 2 Day1, pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 8, 10 hours post dose|Tmax,ss, Time to reach maximum plasma concentration at steady state, Cycle 2 Day1, pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 8, 10 hours post dose|CL/F, Apparent oral plasma clearance, Cycle 2 Day1, pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 8, 10 hours post dose
A Phase I, Open Label, Multicentre Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Preliminary Efficacy of Selumetinib (AZD6244; ARRY-142886) in Combination with First Line Chemotherapy Regimens in Patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
