Effects of a Digital Patient Platform (CMyLife) for Patients With Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) on Information Provision, Patient Empowerment, Medication Compliance, Guideline Adherence and Quality of Life
A controlled before-after study is performed in order to gain insights into the effectiveness of the CMyLife platform in terms of medication compliance, guideline adherence, quality of life, information provision and patient empowerment. Participants who agreed to use the CMyLife platform for at least 6 months, were enrolled in the treatment group and participants who did not agree to use the platform were enrolled in the control group. After signing informed consent, participants received a baseline questionnaire by mail. Upon completion of the baseline questionnaire, participants used (intervention group) or did not use (control group) the CMyLife platform for at least 6 months, after which they were asked to complete the post-intervention questionnaire.
