Effectiveness of Exercise Program in Improving Quality of Life in Patients With Gastric Cancer Undergoing Gastrectomy
This study will investigate the effectiveness of a rehabilitation program in improving fatigue, negative emotions , sleep quality, circadian rhythms and quality of life in patients with gastric cancer undergoing gastrectomy in Taiwan.

Hypothesis:

1. The fatigue in exercise group is significant improving than usual-care group at 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th, 12th, 24th and 36th month.
2. The negative emotions in exercise group is significant improving than usual-care group at 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th, 12th, 24th and 36th month.
3. The sleep quality in exercise group is significant improving than usual-care group at 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th, 12th, 24th and 36th month.
4. The quality of life in exercise group is significant improving than usual-care group at 1st, 2nd,3rd, 6th, 12th, 24th and 36th month.
