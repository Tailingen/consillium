A Study of BBI503 in Adult Patients With Advanced Hepatobiliary Cancer
This is an open label, multi-center, phase II study of BBI503 administered to adult patients with advanced hepatobiliary cancer who have exhausted all currently approved standard anti-cancer treatment options. BBI503 will be administered orally, daily, in continuous 28-day cycles at a dose of 300 mg once daily. Cycles will be repeated until patients are no longer clinically benefiting from therapy.

Safety, efficacy and tolerability of BBI503 will be assessed for the duration of study treatment.

Disease Control Rate (DCR), Defined as the proportion of patients with a documented complete response, partial response, and stable disease (CR + PR + SD) based on RECIST 1.1., 8 weeks
Objective response rate (ORR), Defined as the proportion of patients with a documented complete response and partial response (CR + PR) based on RECIST 1.1., 8 weeks|Progression free survival (PFS), Defined as the time from enrollment to the first objective documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause., 24 months|Overall survival (OS), Defined as the time from enrollment to death due to any cause., 24 months|Pharmacodynamics (biomarkers) of BBI503 when tumor biopsy is possible, baseline, 4 weeks|Number of Patients with Adverse Events, All patients who have received at least one dose of BBI503 will be included in the safety analysis. The incidence of adverse events will be summarized by type of adverse event and severity., 24 months
