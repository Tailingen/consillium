Cigarette smoking is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality from lung cancer among adults in the US. Stress relief and smoking cessation is the best preventive strategy for reducing lung cancer risk and addressing racial disparities in outcomes. Despite this, racial differences are found among those that make quit attempts. Stress has been found to be related to smoking initiation, maintenance, and relapse. Yet, differences in stress responses have not been examined between African American and white smokers. Therefore, this study will examine racial differences in stress responses and smoking behaviors between African American and white male smokers
