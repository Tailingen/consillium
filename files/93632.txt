The Efficacy of Esomeprazole Premedication on Intraoperative Bleeding During Gastric ESD
This will be a single-centre, randomised, endoscopist-blind, parallel-group study in patients who are scheduled endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for gastric mucosal lesion. The primary objective is to observe whether a regimen of 7-day oral esomeprazole premedication can alleviate intraoperative bleeding in patients scheduled for ESD due to gastric mucosal lesions.
