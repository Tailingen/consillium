WEI NASAL JET for The Sedation of Outpatient Upper Gastrointestinal Endoscopy
Low pulse oximetry is the most common adverse events during sedation for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The main reason is the glossoptosis after sedation. In present study a new designed nasopharyngeal airway embedded with jet ventilation catheter(WEI NASAL JET) will be utilized in order to reduce the hypoxia. At the same time the safety will be evaluated.
