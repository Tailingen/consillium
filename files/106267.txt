SEMS Placement Before Surgery in Unblocking Bile Duct in Patients With Periampullary Pancreatic Cancer With Severe Obstructive Jaundice
This trial studies the side effects of self expanding metal stent (SEMS) placement before surgery in unblocking the bile duct in patients with periampullary pancreatic cancer with severe obstructive jaundice. SEMS placement unblocks the bile duct and may help in improving bile drainage prior to surgery in patients with periampullary pancreatic cancer with severe obstructive jaundice.
Pancreatic Cancer
PROCEDURE: Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography|OTHER: Standard of care
Complication Rates of Grade III or Higher, The risk difference will be calculated (stent minus control) with a one-sided 95% confidence interval., At 30 days post-surgery|Intraoperative Estimated Blood Loss, Group comparisons will be performed using two sample t-tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests., At time of surgery
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To compare the 30-day overall complication rates between patients with severe obstructive jaundice undergoing preoperative endoscopic biliary drainage with self expanding metal stents (SEMS) and patients undergoing direct surgical resection.
