Study of Efficacy and Safety of Dabrafenib and Trametinib Combination Therapy in Japanese Patients With BRAF V600E Stage IV NSCLC
This is an open-label, multicenter, non-randomized, single arm, phase II study to assess efficacy and safety of the dabrafenib and trametinib combination in Japanese patients with any line, stage IV NSCLC harboring a confirmed BRAF V600E mutation.

Patients will receive oral dabrafenib twice daily and oral trametinib once daily combination therapy. Patients may continue study treatment until disease progression, unacceptable adverse events, start of a new anti-cancer therapy, consent withdrawal, death, or end of the study. Patients who have met the criteria for disease progression (PD) according to RECIST v1.1 may continue to receive study treatment if the investigator believes the patient is receiving clinical benefit and the patient is willing to continue on study treatment. After discontinuation of study treatment, all patients will be followed for survival until death, lost to follow-up, withdrawal of consent, or end of study.
