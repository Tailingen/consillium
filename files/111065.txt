Prediction Model of ICIs Combined With Chemotherapy in Advanced NSCLC
The reliable predictive markers to identify which patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer tumors will achieve durable clinical benefit for chemo-immunotherapy are needed. This study is a real world study, aiming to establish a multi-parameter model to predict the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitor(ICI) combined with chemotherapy, and to explore the correlation and predictive value of each single biomarker, so as to assist physician to select patients who may benefit for a long time as early as possible and guide clinical accurate treatment.
Lung Cancer, Nonsmall Cell
Progression-free survival（PFS）in days, the time between the time a patient with tumor disease begins treatment and the time when disease progression is observed or death from any cause occurs., From date of enrollment until the date of first documented progression, assessed up to 2 years.
ctDNA in concentration, The best predictive value of ctDNA concentration change threshold and the best collection time., The First treatment (month 1), the second treatment (month 2) and the time of progression (assessed up to 2 years)
