Radiotherapy with Immunotherapy and Anti-Angiogenic Therapy for Advanced HER2-Negative Breast Cancer: a Single-Arm Study
The treatment options for advanced HER2-negative breast cancer are limited. The single or combined drug therapy has a short remission time. Moreover, after multiple lines of treatment, patients are often in an awkward situation of "no more drugs available". And through literature research, it has been found that there is a synergistic effect between immunotherapy and anti-angiogenic therapy, as well as between radiotherapy and immunotherapy. This study will provide new approaches for the treatment of advanced HER2-negative breast cancer in the second-line setting, and offer new evidence-based medical evidence for patients with advanced HER2-negative breast cancer in the era of immunotherapy.
Breast Cancer, Metastatic Breast Cancer
RADIATION: Intensity-modulated radiotherapy|DRUG: Immunotherapy Therapy
Objective response rate, The proportion of subjects whose BOR was rated as CR or PR according to the RECIST 1.1 standard, If the therapeutic effect is CR or PR, the subjects must undergo confirmation no later than 3 weeks (21 days) after the first evaluation.
