SSTR2 Imaging With [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC PET/CT in NPC
This is an investigator-initiated, single-center clinical trial designed to evaluate the feasibility of \[68Ga\]Ga-DOTA-TOC positron emission tomography (PET) scan in patients with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) related nasopharyngeal carcinome (NPC) prior to and three weeks after the start of induction chemotherapy or concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Archival tumor tissue from the diagnostic biopsy will be used to perform somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2) immunohistochemistry (IHC). Blood samples will be drawn at baseline, after three weeks, after completion of induction chemotherapy if applicable, and after CRT.

OTHER: [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC PET imaging
Feasibility of assessing tumor SSTR2 expression, Determine feasibility of assessing tumor SSTR2 expression in patients with EBV-associated NPC in a non-endemic region by repeat \[68Ga\]Ga-DOTA-TOC PET imaging., From the day of the first study scan within one week before the start of treatment to the day of the second study scan three weeks after the start of treatment
[68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC uptake in the primary tumor and lymph node metastase, Determine \[68Ga\]Ga-DOTA-TOC uptake in the primary tumor and lymph node metastases in patients with EBV-related NPC, at baseline and early after the start of curative intent treatment, consisting of CRT with or without induction chemotherapy., From the day of the first study scan within one week before the start of treatment to the day of the second study scan three weeks after the start of treatment|[68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC distribution, Normal tissue and organ distribution of \[68Ga\]Ga-DOTA-TOC in NPC patients defined by standard uptake value (SUV), From the day of the first study scan within one week before the start of treatment to the day of the second study scan three weeks after the start of treatment|Comparison [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC uptake with SSTR expression, Comparison of tumor \[68Ga\]Ga-DOTA-TOC uptake on the baseline study PET scan with SSTR2 expression on the tumor biopsy, determined by IHC., The day of the first study scan within one week before the start of treatment
