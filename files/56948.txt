Sequential Chemotherapy and Blinatumomab to Improve MRD Response and Survival in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
The present study aims at analyzing the response to treatment of adult patients homogeneously treated with supportive care, chemotherapy and blinatumomab.
Acute Lymphoid Leukemia|Philadelphia Chromosome-Negative B-Cell Precursor
DRUG: Chemotherapy + Blinatumomab
Number of patients that obtain a negative Minimal Residual Disease (MRD), At week 14 from study entry
Number of patients in complete remission (CR), At 32 months from study entry|Number of patients that reach disease-free survial, At 32 months from study entry|Number of patients that relapse, At 32 months from study entry|Number of patients that dye due to treatment, Treatment-related mortality, At 32 months from study entry|Number of serious adverse events, Safety, At 32 months from study entry
Eligible patients with CD19+ Ph- BCP ALL (Philadelphia-negative B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia) will receive homogeneous supportive care, chemotherapy and blinatumomab immunotherapy, and will be homogeneously analyzed for response at prefixed time points from induction day 1. For risk-oriented therapy, patients in complete remission (CR) will be stratified by risk class according to the diagnostic characteristics and MRD (minimal residual disease) study results during early consolidation.
