Study of Paclitaxel Plus Cisplatin as the First-line Chemotherapy in High Risk Gestational Trophoblastic Tumor
This clinical trial is designed to study the effect and safety of paclitaxel plus cisplatin as the first-line regimen in the treatment of high risk gestational trophoblastic tumor.

Gestational trophoblastic tumor (GTN) is a group of malignant tumors derived from placental trophoblastic cells, most of which occur in women of reproductive age. The survival rate of patients with score of 7 or more points, or WHO â…£ period for high-risk patients was of 60% to 80%. However, due to severe toxic reactions, long treatment time, loss of optimal reproductive age and increased costs, and treatment failure caused by chemotherapy resistance, high-risk GTN is still one of the tumors seriously affecting the life health and quality of life of young women.

First-line chemotherapy recommended by FIGO is regimen of EMA - CO with corresponding side effects and adverse factors in the following aspects as relatively higer incidence of myelosupression, VP - 16 being associated with a second tumor, especially leukemia, and a definite effect of cyclophosphamide on the failure ovarian function Taxol (Taxol) is the most widely used and most effective broad-spectrum anti-tumor drug in gynecological malignant tumors at present, and T (paclitaxel) +P (platinum drugs) scheme is the first-line chemotherapy scheme in ovarian cancer patients at present. According to references, TP also has effects on resistant and refactory high risk GTN patients.

Given relatively simple operation way of TP chemotherapy, and the effect of chemotherapy in recurrence and high-risk refractory GTN performance,this prospective multicenter randomized controlled clinical research was to study the effect and safety of paclitaxel plus cisplatin as the first-line regimen in the treatment of high risk gestational trophoblastic tumor compared with EMA-CO.
