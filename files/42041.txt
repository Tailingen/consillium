Study of MHB088C in Participants With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This study will evaluate the safety/tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of MHB088C in participants with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
DRUG: MHB088C for Injection
Evaluate the incidence of adverse events (AEs), Adverse events was assessed by investigator(s) according to NCI-CTCAE v5.0, through study completion, an average of 1 year|Evaluate the incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), Dose-limiting toxicities are defined as side effects of a drug or other treatment that are serious enough to prevent an increase in dose or level of that treatment, through study completion, an average of 1 year|Determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of MHB088C, The recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) is determined traditionally by dose-limiting toxicities., through study completion, an average of 1 year
Pharmacokinetics (PK) parameter: Maximum concentration (Cmax), MHB088C, total antibody, free toxin MH30010008, Within 5 cycles (each cycle is 28 days)|PK parameter: Time to maximum concentration (Tmax), MHB088C, total antibody, free toxin MH30010008, Within 5 cycles (each cycle is 28 days)|PK parameter: Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), MHB088C, total antibody, free toxin MH30010008, Within 5 cycles (each cycle is 28 days)|PK parameter: Trough concentration (Ctrough), MHB088C, total antibody, free toxin MH30010008, Within 5 cycles (each cycle is 28 days)|PK parameter: Terminal or apparent terminal half-life (t1/2), MHB088C, total antibody, free toxin MH30010008, Within 5 cycles (each cycle is 28 days)|PK parameter: Systemic clearance (CL), MHB088C, total antibody, free toxin MH30010008, Within 5 cycles (each cycle is 28 days)|Immunogenicity Assessment, Assessment of anti-drug antibody (ADA), Within 5 cycles (each cycle is 28 days)|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective Response Rate was defined as the percentage of participants with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), through study completion, an average of 1 year|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR was defined as the time from first assessment of PR or CR until disease progression., through study completion, an average of 1 year|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR was defined as the proportion of participants with a complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD)., through study completion, an average of 1 year|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression-free Survival (PFS) (median) was determined using the number of months measured from the initial date of treatment to the date of documented progression, or the date of death (in the absence of progression) of participants. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., through study completion, an average of 1 year
This study is the first-in-human (FIH) trial of MHB088C, which contains two parts: dose escalation (part one) and dose expansion (part two).

Part one: Dose Escalation Study of MHB088C Monotherapy in Participants with Advanced or Metastatic Malignant Solid Tumors The dose escalation part is an open-label, multi-center study in which the eligible participants with advanced or metastatic solid tumors will be enrolled to receive MHB088C monotherapy to assess the safety and tolerability of MHB088C in participants with advanced or metastatic solid tumors, to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MHB088C, and to assess its pharmacokinetic profile and preliminary efficacy.

The dose expansion part is an open-label, multi-center, multi-cohort expansion study in which participants with advanced or metastatic solid tumors of some predefined cancer types will be enrolled to receive MHB088C monotherapy. Participants with same types of solid tumors will be randomised into different selected dose groups and will be treated with the corresponding dose. This study is designed to assess the preliminary efficacy and safety of MHB088C monotherapy in participants with some types of advanced or metastatic solid tumors, so as to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D); and to assess the immunogenicity and pharmacokinetic profiles of MHB088C.
