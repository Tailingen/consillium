Proactive Psychiatry Consultation for Patients With Cancer and Severe Mental Illness
Individuals with severe mental illness (SMI) including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are dying younger than the general population; cancer is a leading cause of death in this population. People with SMI have higher rates of dying from breast, lung, and colon cancer, and disparities in treatment appear to be one contributing factor. Individuals with SMI may be diagnosed with more advanced stage cancer and less likely to receive stage-appropriate cancer treatment. Although collaborative care models integrating medical and psychiatric care have shown promise in other populations, the challenge of treating SMI and cancer is distinct and relatively understudied. Patients may have uncontrolled psychiatric symptoms that can impact their understanding of their diagnosis and treatment decisions. Oncologists have less training and inadequate time to address multiple unmet needs. Mental health care is frequently fragmented from cancer care.

The investigators want to understand if it is helpful for patients with SMI to be connected to a psychiatrist and case manager when cancer is diagnosed. Optimizing psychiatric symptoms and facilitating communication between the patient, the oncology team, and mental health providers may improve care. The goal is to pilot a pragmatic intervention for patients with cancer and SMI that can be integrated into cancer care, is acceptable to patients and oncology clinicians, and may promote the delivery of stage-appropriate cancer treatment to an underserved population.

Patients will be connected to a psychiatrist and case manager at cancer diagnosis who will follow the patient and communicate with the oncology team during the 12 week intervention. All participants will complete brief surveys at baseline, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks. Oncology clinicians will provide feedback about the intervention at 12 weeks. Cancer treatment received and healthcare utilization will be assessed at 6 months post-intervention.

Feasibility of implementing the intervention in patients with SMI and cancer, Feasibility of participating in the intervention:

* At least 75% of intervention participants complete the psychiatric diagnostic assessment and establish contact with the case manager
* At least 75% of enrolled patients complete the patient-reported measures.

Feasibility of enrollment process:

â€¢ At least 50% of patients who are approached enroll in the intervention, 12 weeks

Specific Aims:

Aim 1: To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of proactive psychiatry consultation and case management among individuals with SMI treated at the MGH Cancer Center and their oncology clinicians.

Aim 2: To describe the rates of receipt of stage-appropriate cancer treatment and patterns of healthcare utilization in patients with SMI and cancer who are receiving the intervention

Aim 3: To explore patterns of change in psychiatric symptoms, quality of life, illness understanding, and alliance with the oncology clinician in patients with SMI and a recent cancer diagnosis who are receiving the intervention.
