Low-Intensity CBT for Gynaecological Cancer Survivors
There are 21,500 gynaecological cancers diagnosed in the UK each year. These are often diagnosed later than common cancers, which is predictive of low survival and high psychological distress. There are few studies published which accurately map the profile of distress and supportive care needs in gynaecological cancer patients, nor which test psychological interventions to support this group.

This study will use a non-randomised controlled trial design to explore the potential benefits of taking part in a psychological intervention designed in this group of women. The intervention is group-delivered and runs for eight weeks. It is delivered by psychologists, psychological wellbeing practitioners, and cancer nurse specialists. The investigators will use validated self-report questionnaires to assess how helpful this intervention is at reducing distress and improving quality of life in the participants. This will be done in comparison with a treatment-as-usual control group recruited from a second clinical site. This second group of participants will not receive the psychological intervention, but they will complete the same assessments, at the same time points. To ensure participants are well supported, data collection in control control group participants will be done by telephone interview rather than self-report questionnaires. Both groups of participants will undertake a three-month follow-up assessment to check the longer-term effectiveness of the psychological intervention.

OTHER: Group delivered Low Intensity Cognitive Behavioural Therapy
Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), A nine-item screening tool to assess symptoms of depression in the responding individual (Kroenke, Spitzer, \& Williams, 2001). The PHQ-9 uses a four-point rating scale (ranging from 0 to 3) asking how often in the last two weeks participants have experienced symptoms pertaining to appetite, concentration, energy hopelessness, and suicidality. Higher scores indicate higher levels of distress. The PHQ-9 has been established as a valid and reliable measure of depression severity (Kroenke et al., 2001)., last 2 weeks|Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), A seven-item screening tool to assess symptoms of anxiety in the responding individual (Spitzer, Kroenke, Williams, \& LÃ¶we, 2006). The GAD-7 uses a four-point rating scale (ranging from 0 to 3) asking how often in the last two weeks participants have experienced symptoms pertaining to feeling anxious, worried, difficulty relaxing, and irritability. Higher scores indicate higher distress. The GAD-7 has been established as an accurate measure of anxiety (Swinson, 2006)., last 2 weeks
The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G), A 33-item screening tool to assess quality-of-life in patients receiving cancer treatment (Cella et al., 1993). The FACT-G uses a five-point rating scale (ranging from 0 to 4) asking how often in the last seven days patients have experienced difficulties in four dimensions of well-being: physical; social/family; emotional; functional. Higher scores indicate lower quality-of-life. The FACT-G is a well validated tool for measuring quality-of-life in cancer sample (Luckett et al., 2011)., last 7 days
