PROACTIVE: Preventing Acute/Chronic GVHD With TocIlizumab Combined With GVHD Prophylaxis Post allogEneic Transplant
This is a phase II open-label trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of tocilizumab in improving GVHD-free/relapse-free survival (GRFS) after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) for hematologic malignancy.
Hematologic Malignancy
DRUG: Tacrolimus|DRUG: Methotrexate|DRUG: Tocilizumab
The Number of Patients With GVHD/Relapse-free (GRFS) Survival, GRFS is defined as survival without grade III-IV acute graft versus host disease (GVHD), systemic therapy requiring chronic GVHD, relapse, or death at 12 months after matched related/unrelated donor bone marrow or peripheral blood allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) using myeloablative conditioning (MAC). Patients who are alive without GVHD will be censored at the last follow-up., Day 365
The research team earlier hypothesized and demonstrated that tocilizumab could attenuate the incidence of acute GVHD (aGVHD) after myeloablative conditioning (MAC) and reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT), using matched sibling or unrelated donor. In this study, the research team hypothesizes that longer term interleukin 6 (IL-6) inhibition through treatment with tocilizumab by repeated dosing would mediate a beneficial effect not only on the risk of aGVHD, but also on chronic GVHD. This will be achieved by administering an additional dose of tocilizumab at Day +100 post-alloHCT, besides the pretransplant dose, as done in our previous clinical trial, thereby providing total prophylaxis against both acute and chronic GVHD.
