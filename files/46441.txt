Allogenic CD123-CAR-NK Cells in the Treatment of Refractory/Relapsed Acute Myeloid Leukemia
The CD123-Targeted CAR-NK cell therapy is a new treatment that is being investigated for treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of CD123-CAR NK cells given to these patients.

BIOLOGICAL: CD123-CAR-NK cells
Dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), 1 Months|Treatment-emergent adverse events, 3 months|Treatment-related adverse events, 3 months
Complete response (CR), 3 months|Progression free survival (PFS), 12 months|Overall Survival (OS), 12 months|Proportion of subjects with minimal-residual disease (MRD) negative response, 3 months|The area under the concentration time-curve (AUC) of CD123-CAR-NK cells, 3 Months|Peak levels of CD123-CAR-NK cells (maximum concentration or Cmax), 3 Months
This is a study of allogenic CD123-CAR NK cells. The relapsed/refractory AML patients will receive FC (F, Fludarabine, C, Cyclophosphamide) chemotherapy followed by infusion of CD123-CAR-NK cells. No graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prevention will be conducted before or after infusion. Dose-limiting toxicity, incidence of adverse events, disease response and PK/PD will be detected post-infusion.
