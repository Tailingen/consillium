Radiotherapy to the Primary in Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Patients
study the effect of radiotherapy to the primary lesion after first line systemic therapy in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer patients.
Non-Small Cell Carcinoma of Lung, TNM Stage 4|Radiation Therapy
DRUG: first line systemic therapy|RADIATION: 3D radiotherapy or IMRT
progression free survival, time from randomization till disease progression, six months|patients quality of life, using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer core quality of life questionnaire, the EORTC QLQ-C30, six months
overall survival, time from randomization till death from any cause, six months|patients toxicity, number of participants suffer of different toxicity grades according to Common toxicity criteria of adverse events, six months|patients pattern of failure, Number of Participants suffer of disease progression in the primary site vs other newly developed sites, six months
Metastatic non-small cell lung cancer patients after receiving their first line systemic therapy according to their genetic mutation will be randomized to follow up versus radiotherapy to the primary lesion.
