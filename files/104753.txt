A Study of JNJ-64264681 and JNJ-67856633 in Participants With Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
The primary purpose of this study is to determine: the recommended Phase 2 doses (RP2Ds) of JNJ-64264681 and JNJ 67856633 when administered together in participants with B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (Part A - Dose Escalation); and the safety of the RP2Ds for this combination in different histologies/participant populations (Part B - Cohort Expansion).
Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin|Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
DRUG: JNJ-64264681|DRUG: JNJ-67856633
Part A: Number of Participants with Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLT), Number of participants with DLT will be assessed. The DLTs are specific adverse events and are defined as any of the following: high grade non-hematologic toxicity, or hematologic toxicity., Up to 28 days|Part A and Part B: Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant participating in a clinical study that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the pharmaceutical/biological agent under study., Up to 3 years and 9 months
Plasma Concentrations of JNJ-64264681 and JNJ-67856633, Plasma concentrations of JNJ-64264681 and JNJ-67856633 will be assessed., Up to 3 years and 9 months|Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) Occupancy in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell (PBMCs), BTK occupancy will be assessed., Up to 3 years and 9 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined according to Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (iwCLL); and Response assessment in Waldenstr√∂m Macroglobulinemia (IWWM)., Up to 3 years and 9 months|Time to First Response, Time to first response defined for the responders as the time from the date of first dose of study treatment to the date of initial documentation of a first response as defined in the disease-specific response criteria., Up to 3 years and 9 months|Duration of Response, DOR will be calculated from the date of initial documentation of a response to the date of first documented evidence of relapse, as defined in the disease-specific response criteria, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 3 years and 9 months
Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase that plays a critical role in B cell activation via the B cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway. BTK is important for normal B-cell activation and the pathophysiology of B cell malignancies. A few BTK inhibitors have demonstrated clinical activity in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Non-Hodgkin lymphoma represents a diverse set of diseases, of which more than 60 subtypes have been identified and classified by the world health organization. JNJ-64264681 is a second-generation, orally active, selective, and irreversible covalent inhibitor of BTK and JNJ-67856633 is an orally bioavailable, potent, and selective first in class mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1 (MALT1) inhibitor that binds to an allosteric site on MALT1 with a mixed-type mechanism. JNJ-64264681 and JNJ-67856633 inhibit BTK and MALT1, respectively, and both BTK and MALT1 are involved in transmitting the pro-survival BCR signal. The study will consist of Screening Phase (28 days); Treatment Phase (from Cycle 1 Day 1 up to end of treatment, each cycle is a 21-day cycle) and a Follow-up Phase (from end of treatment visit until lost to follow-up, withdrawal of consent, death, 6 months after start of first subsequent antineoplastic therapy, after the clinical cut off (CCO) date participants will be withdrawn from the study 30 days after the last dose of study drugs were administered). The total study duration is estimated at 2 years and 2 months. Safety assessments will include physical examinations, vital signs, electrocardiograms, clinical safety laboratory assessments, eastern cooperative oncology group performance status, echocardiogram, and adverse events monitoring.
