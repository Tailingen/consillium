Almonertinib Plus Chemotherapy as First-line Treatment in Patients With EGFR Concomitant Tumor Suppressor Gene Mutation
This is a multicenter, randomized, controlled, phase III study.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Almonertinib|DRUG: Almonertinib plus carboplatin and pemetrexed
Progression Free Survival (PFS), To assess the efficacy of Almonertinib compared with Almonertinib Plus carboplatin and pemetrexed as first line therapy to EGFRm+, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients by assessment of progression free survival (PFS) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1)., From baseline, then every 6 weeks, until disease progression or discontinuation from study. From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months.
Assess the anti-tumor activity: OS, Overall survival (OS), Start of study drug to Survival Endpoint through study completion, an average of 3 years.|Assess the anti-tumor activity: ORR, ORR is defined as the percentage of patients who have at least 1 response of CR or PR prior to any evidence of progression assessed up to 24 months, From baseline, then every 6 weeks, until disease progression or discontinuation from study. ORR is defined as the percentage of patients who have at least 1 response of CR or PR prior to any evidence of progression assessed up to 24 months.|Assess the anti-tumor activity: DCR, Disease control rate (DCR), From baseline, then every 6 weeks, until disease progression or discontinuation from study. The DCR is defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall response of CR, PR, or SD assessed up to 24 months.|Assess the anti-tumor activity: DoR, Duration of response (DoR), DoR is defined as the time from the date of first documented response until the date of documented progression or death in the absence of disease progression assessed up to 24 months.|Assess the anti-tumor activity: DepOR, Depth of response (DepOR), From baseline, then every 6 weeks, until disease progression or discontinuation from study. DepOR is defined as the sum of the lengths of the longest diameters of the RECIST 1.1 target lesions up to 24 months.|Assess the safety of Almonertinib and Almonertinib plus pemetrexed and carboplatin: Number of AEs/SAEs, Number of adverse events (AEs)/serious adverse events (SAEs), Continuously throughout the study until 28 days after Termination of the treatment
