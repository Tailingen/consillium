Neoadjuvant Furmonertinib and Cisplatin/Pemetrexed as in EGFR Mutated Stage IIIA-IIIB Resectable NSCLC (FORESEE)
In this open-label, single-arm, phase 2 study, 40 eligible patients with EGFR mutated stage IIIA-IIIB resectable NSCLC will be recruited to receive furmonertinib for 9 weeks combined with cisplatin/pemetrexed for 3 cycles (21 d/cycle) as neoadjuvant therapy before radical surgery. Radiological and pathological evaluations will be performed before and after the neoadjuvant therapy to assess the efficacy of treatment. Adverse events during neoadjuvant therapy, disease and survival status will also be collected in the study.
