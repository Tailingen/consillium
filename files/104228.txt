Comparison of Karydakis and Limberg Flap Treatment of Pilonidal Sinus in Adolescent. a Prospective, Randomised Study
Pilonidal sinus disease (PSD) is a chronic inflammation and infection of the sacrococcygeal region. Produces clinic findings with abscess and discharge in the sacrococcygeal region or painful sinus tract in the natal cleft. Its incidence rate among Turkish servicemen is reported to be 8.8% in a study. Although pilonidal sinus disease is common in men, this is the opposite in adolescence. Because adolescent girls are 2 or 3 times more.

Karydakis flap and Limberg flap operations widely preferred in recent years in the surgical treatment of PSD. In our study, we aim to compare these two techniques prospectively and randomly.
Pilonidal Sinus|Postoperative Complications
PROCEDURE: pilonidal sinus excision
Postoperative recurrence, pain, swelling and redness in examination, 1 month
Postoperative infection, purulent drainage, 1 week|Postoperative wound dehiscence, wound separation, 1 week
The best treatment technique for pilonidal sinus disease (PSD) is still controversial. While some researchers prefer minimally invasive methods, some researchers prefer surgical treatment. The most important concern in surgical treatment options is the prolongation of the disease recovery time and recurrence of the disease. Complications that may develop after treatment prolong the treatment period. The aim of this prospective, randomized study was to compare the results of the widely used Limberg and Karydakis flap operations in recent years. The parameters that will be used in the comparison will be an infection, recurrence and wound decomposition.
