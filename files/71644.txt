Changes in depressive symptoms assessed by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, Depressive symptoms will be measured with the 10-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). The score can range from 0-30 and higher scores indicate more depressive symptoms., Baseline to 1-month follow-up, 3-month follow-up, and 6-month follow-up|Changes in anxiety symptoms assessed by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screener, Anxiety symptoms will be measured with the 7-item GAD-7 scale (Spitzer et al., 2006). This scale measures generalized anxiety symptoms in the past 7 days, has score ranges from 0-21 with higher scores indicating greater anxiety symptoms., Baseline to 1-month follow-up, 3-month follow-up, and 6-month follow-up|Changes in health-related quality of life assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy: General (FACT-G)., Health-related quality of life will be measured by the 27-item FACT-G, which assess four domains: physical well-being, social well-being, emotional well-being and functional well-being. The score ranges from 0-108 with higher scores indicating better quality of life., Baseline to 1-month follow-up, 3-month follow-up, and 6-month follow-up|Changes in perceived stress assessed by the Perceived Stress Scale., Perceived stress is measured by the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). The score ranges from 0-40 with higher scores indicating higher perceived stress., Baseline to 1-month follow-up, 3-month follow-up, and 6-month follow-up|Changes in cancer-related fatigue assessed by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Fatigue, Cancer-related fatigue is measured by the 13-item Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Fatigue (FACIT). The score ranges from 0-52 with higher scores indicating greater fatigue., Baseline to 1-month follow-up, 3-month follow-up, and 6-month follow-up
Chinese Americans are one of the fastest growing immigrant groups in the United States, but there is still a lack of culturally-sensitive and linguistically-appropriate resources and interventions for this group. To address this gap, the investigators will examine the efficacy and feasibility of Expressive Helping, a writing intervention designed to lead participants to write about their cancer experiences. Participants will be adult cancer survivors of Chinese descent. After screening and consent, eligible participants will be enrolled in a 1:1:1 randomized controlled trial. Assessments of psychological symptoms will occur at baseline (prior to randomization), 1-month post-intervention, 3-months post-intervention, and 6-months post-intervention.
