Uniform FDG-PET Guided Gradient Dose Prescription to Reduce Late Radiation Toxicity
The objective of the UPGRADE-RT trial is to investigate whether de-escalation of elective radiation dose and introduction of an intermediate dose-level in the treatment of head and neck cancer will results in less radiation sequelae and improved quality of life after treatment whilst the recurrence rate in electively irradiated lymph nodes should not be compromised.

Head and Neck Neoplasms|Carcinoma, Squamous Cell
RADIATION: standard dose prescription|RADIATION: FDG-PET guided gradient dose prescription
Toxicity: normalcy of diet (score of the performance status scale for head and neck cancer patients), 12 months
Safety: recurrence in electively irradiated lymph nodes, A Kaplan-Meier estimate will be calculated, 24 months
Acute toxicity (common toxicity criteria v2.0), up to 3 months|Late toxicity: swallowing function (water swallowing test), 3, 12 and 24 months|Late toxicity: salivary gland function (stimulated flow rates), 3, 12 and 24 months|Late toxicity: thyroid gland function (thyroid stimulating hormone blood test), 3, 12 and 24 months|Quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-H&N35 questionnaires), 3, 6, 12 and 24 months|Xerostomia related quality of life (GRIX questionnaire), 3, 6, 12 and 24 months|Dysphagia related quality of life (SWAL-QOL questionnaire), 3, 6, 12 and 24 months|Loco-regional control, A Kaplan-Meier estimate will be calculated, 24 months|Overall survival, A Kaplan-Meier estimate will be calculated, 24 months|Disease specific survival, A Kaplan-Meier estimate will be calculated, 24 months
