A Study to Evaluate Lenti-HPV-07 Immunotherapy Against HPV+ Cervical or Oropharyngeal Cancer
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn about the safety and efficacy of a potential new treatment called Lenti-HPV-07 in patients with a cancer induced by Human Papilloma Virus (HPV).

The main questions aim to answer are:

* Is Lenti-HPV-07 safe?
* Does Lenti-HPV-07 induce an immune response?

Participants will be assigned to a group based on their cancer type

* either study drug group A: recurrent and/or metastatic cancer
* or study drug group B: newly diagnosed with locally advanced cancer

After they finish the study treatment, they will be followed for up to 1 year. Follow-up visits will occur via clinic visits or phone calls 4 weeks after the last study treatment and then quarterly for up to 1 year.
