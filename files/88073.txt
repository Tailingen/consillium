A Study of IBI3003 in Subjects With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
This is a phase 1/2 multicenter, open-label, first-in-human study of IBI3003. It includes a phase 1 dose escalation and expansion section to identify maximum tolerated dose(MTD)/recommended Phase 2 Dose(RP2D) of IBI3003, plans to enroll 23\~116 subjects, and a phase 2 stage to explore efficacy, safety and tolerability of IBI3003 at RP2D in multiple myeloma.
