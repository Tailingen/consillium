Peripheral neuropathy is a serious condition characterized by symmetrical, distal damage to the peripheral nerves that may be caused by several classes of drugs, including chemotherapeutic agents. Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is an adverse effect estimated to occur in up to 40% of patients undergoing chemotherapy, with its incidence increasing in patients being treated with multiple agents. Pharmacists play a pivotal role in the prevention and management of CIPN by recommending evidence-based pharmacologic and non pharmacologic strategies appropriate for the individual patient.Peripheral neuropathy (PN) is a systemic disease characterized by symmetrical, distal damage to the peripheral nerves that negatively impacts patient quality of life (QOL). Prolonged symptoms associated with PN can cause pain, interfere with functional ability (e.g., dressing, driving, house-work), and disrupt emotional health.
