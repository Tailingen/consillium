SPECTA: Screening Cancer Patients for Efficient Clinical Trial Access
SPECTA is a quality assured platform for collecting clinicopathologically annotated biological material, imaging data, operative images, environmental assessment, questionnaires as well as patient-reported outcomes from cancer patients to support biospecimen-based translational research and clinical cancer research, including biomarker discovery to improve the understanding of tumor biology and cancer patients care.
All Tumor Types

To establish a quality assured platform to improve the understanding of tumor biology and cancer patients care, material (including imaging data) as well as patient-reported outcomes from patients with cancer diagnosis to support biospecimen-based translational research and biomarker discovery to improve the understanding of tumor biology and cancer patients care., 5 years
To perform biospecimen and data based high quality research aiming to better understand the biology of cancer, and/or how it is currently managed and/or how to better diagnose and treat it in the future;, 5 years|To investigate the molecular pathways related to the development of specific tumors from a biological point of view;, 5 years|To investigate the effect of cancer treatment on the tumor, microenvironment and patients globally;, 5 years|To collect large series of homogeneous clinical data to analyse the disease course and treatment performed;, 5 years|To investigate the prevalence and validate the prognostic or predictive value of novel biomarkers in cancers;, 5 years|To perform biospecimen and data based high quality research aiming to facilitate the discovery of new test for tumor biomarkers or facilitate the establishment of validated tests for tumor biomarkers;, 5 years|To identify patients with molecular alterations in their tumor that can be matched to biomarker-driven clinical trials, to facilitate enrollment of cancer patients in biomarker-driven clinical trials., 5 years
Patients are recruited in the platform for the research purpose of 4 downstream projects. For more information, please have a look at the "Groups and cohorts" section.
