Naltrexone and Propranolol Combined With Immunotherapy
Various forms of stress can promote cancer development and growth and negatively impact the immune system's response to tumors. Beta-adrenergic and opioid receptors co-exist in many cells including immune cells and are integral components of the body's response to stress. Pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that dual blockade of these receptors can decrease tumor growth and modulate the anti-tumor immune response. This clinical trial investigates the safety and potential therapeutic benefits of combining a beta-adrenergic blocker (propranolol) and an opioid receptor antagonist (naltrexone) with immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with advanced melanoma.

Exploratory objectives are to assess the impact of propranolol + naltrexone on the anti-tumor immune response through correlative biomarker studies performed on tumor and blood., up to 2 years from start of treatment
This is an open-label, single institution, phase I clinical trial to investigate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of dose-escalated naltrexone (NTX) in combination with propranolol (PRO), ipilimumab (IPI), and nivolumab (NIVO) in patients with advanced melanoma.
