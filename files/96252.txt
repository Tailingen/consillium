Gastric Caner
DRUG: Albumin Bound Paclitaxel|DRUG: 5-FU
PFS(Progression-free survival ), The PFS was calculated from the initiation of chemotherapy to the date of disease progression or death, 80% PFS events,, an expected average of 10 months
OS (Overall survival ), Overall survival was measured from the initiation of chemotherapy to the date of the last follow-up or death., OS follow-up period: 18 months or 80% OS events, whichever occurs first
ORR (Overall tumor response), Overall tumor response: This is defined as the occurrence of either a confirmed complete (CR) or a partial (PR) best overall response as determined by the RECIST criteria from confirmed radiographic evaluations of target and non-target lesions., 80% PFS events, an expected average of 10 months
