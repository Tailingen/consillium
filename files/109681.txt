Dosimetric Validation of Scans Generated by GAN From Pre-therapeutic MRI in Stereotactic Cerebral Radiotherapy
Stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) is being widely accepted as a treatment of choice for patients with a small number of brain metastases and an acceptable size, allowing a better target dose conformity resulting in high local control rates and better sparing of organs at risk. Currently, imaging for such a delivery technique requires both a recent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain study for volume definition and a computed tomography (CT) scan for SRT planning. An MRI-only workflow could reduce the risk of misalignment between the two imaging modalities and shorten the delay of planning. Given the absence of a calibrated electronic density on MRI, the investigators aim to assess the equivalence of synthetic CTs generated by a generative adversarial network (GAN) for planning in the brain SRT setting.
Brain Metastases
Local Gamma Analysis Passing Rate, To be considered as comparable, 2 dose maps must have a Local Gamma Analysis Passing Rate higher than 98%. The primary outcome measure will be to compare the Local Gamma Analysis Passing Rate between the 2 dose maps (one initial dosimetric planification and one dosimetric planification extracted from the synthetic ct scan)., Once, at the time of treatment delivery
Global Gamma Analysis Passing Rate, To be considered as comparable, 2 dose maps must have a Global Gamma Analysis Passing Rate higher than 95%. The primary outcome measure will be to compare the Global Gamma Analysis Passing Rate between the 2 dose maps (one initial dosimetric planification and one dosimetric planification extracted from the synthetic ct scan)., Once, at the time of treatment delivery|Planning Target Volume's coverage values, Planning Target Volume's (PTV) coverage values will be compared between the initial dosimetric planification and the dosimetric planification extracted from the synthetic ct scan., Once, at the time of treatment delivery|Organs at risk Dose Constraints, Dose constraints to the Organs at Risks (OAR) will be compared between the initial dosimetric planification and the dosimetric planification extracted from the synthetic ct scan., Once, at the time of treatment delivery
