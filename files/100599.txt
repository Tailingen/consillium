Rituximab Neoadjuvant Therapy in Patients With Prostate Cancer Scheduled to Undergo Radical Prostatectomy
There is now substantial evidence that B cells are recruited into prostate cancers by CXCL13 released by the tumor cells. B cells release lymphotoxin which drives malignant cell proliferation through the NFkB pathway. This is a pilot trial in 18 patients to determine whether depletion of B cells by rituximab will result in a decrease in the extent of B cell infiltration of the prostatic cancer. The extent of infiltration in the diagnostic biopsy will be compared to that in the prostatectomy samples following administration of 4 weekly doses of rituximab.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: rituximab
Histologic response rate after one cycle of rituximab, 1 treatment cycle (28 days)
Change in prostate-specific antigen (PSA), from Day 1 to Day 29|Change in peripheral blood B cell number, from Day 1 to Day 29|Change in serum CXCL13 level, from Day 1 to Day 29
This is an open label, single institution, pilot study of rituximab neoadjuvant therapy in patients with high risk prostate cancer scheduled to undergo radical prostatectomy. Prior to prostatectomy, patients will receive one treatment cycle (28 days) of rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenously once weekly. Patients will be scheduled to undergo radical prostatectomy within two weeks of completing study treatment. Tissue from prostatectomy will be used for immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of pharmacodynamic markers.
