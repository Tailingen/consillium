Immunohistochemical Expression of Inhibin Beta A (INHBA) in Colorectal Carcinoma
A retrospective observational study to evaluate immunohistochemical expression of Inhibin Beta A (INHBA) in 60 cases of Colorectal Carcinoma, and compare levels of its expression to different clinicopathological criteria.
Colorectal Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Immunohistochemical staining
Detection of INHBA in Colorectal Carcinoma., Detection of expression of INHBA in Colorectal Carcinoma cells by immunohistochemical approach, using anti-human INHBA monoclonal antibody., 6 months
Correlation between INHBA expression in Colorectal Carcinoma and clinicopathological parameters., Correlation between different levels of INHBA expression in Colorectal Carcinoma cells and some clinical and pathological parameters as age, sex, tumor phenotype and nodal status., 6 months
Colorectal Carcinoma is an aggressive malignant epithelial tumor with an observable high incidence. Tumor invasion and metastasis to distant sites are two important issues which determine patient's outcome, so detecting novel biological markers that are involved in tumor proliferation and invasion with subsequent targeting by future medical drugs will positively improve patient's prognosis.

Inhibin Beta A (INHBA) is a glycoprotein molecule that has a role in tumor cells proliferation and invasion in different human malignancies. The aim of this study is to detect expression of INHBA in 60 archived formalin-fixed Paraffin-embedded tissue blocks of patients suffered from Colorectal Carcinoma, and to correlate different levels of its expression to some studied clinical and pathological criteria (Age, Sex, Tumor size, location, depth of tumor invasion, status of regional lymph nodes, vascular and perineural invasion).
