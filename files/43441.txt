Comprehensive Lifestyle Improvement Program for Men With Prostate Cancer2 (CLIPP2)
This study is an investigator initiated clinical study. A prospective, single arm unblinded, open label study will be carried out to determine the feasibility of recruitment, retention and adherence of 36 prostate cancer survivors who have been on androgen deprivation therapy within the last 5 years for a lifestyle modification intervention.

INTRODUCTION:

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has been demonstrated to improve disease free and over-all survival in men with prostate cancer (PCa).

ADT for PCa is associated with adverse cardio-metabolic effects such as reduced libido, hot flashes, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, myocardial infarction and stroke. This reduces quality of life (QoL) and potentially affects mortality.

There is paucity of data regarding comprehensive lifestyle interventions in men on ADT for Pca. Existing studies used non-standardized interventions or lack data on metabolic risk factors.

CLIPP is designed to address these gaps by using an intervention modelled after the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) with an emphasis on low carbohydrate and a Keto Diet, a standardized multi-component intervention with demonstrated effectiveness in reducing diabetes risk factors that has been successfully adapted for multiple disease types including breast cancer.
