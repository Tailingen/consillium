Objective response rate (ORR), Tumor will be evaluated according to RECIST-1.1. CT or MRI can be used for tumor imaging at the investigator's discretion., Imaging examination will be performed for tumor assessment every 6 weeks (±7 days) from the first dose of Simmitecan until PD, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or death.|progression free survival (PFS), Tumor will be evaluated according to RECIST-1.1. CT or MRI can be used for tumor imaging at the investigator's discretion., Imaging examination will be performed for tumor assessment every 6 weeks (±7 days) from the first dose of Simmitecan until PD, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or death.|CBR (clinical benefit rate), Tumor will be evaluated according to RECIST-1.1. CT or MRI can be used for tumor imaging at the investigator's discretion., Imaging examination will be performed for tumor assessment every 6 weeks (±7 days) from the first dose of Simmitecan until PD, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or death.|DCR (disease control rate), Tumor will be evaluated according to RECIST-1.1. CT or MRI can be used for tumor imaging at the investigator's discretion., Imaging examination will be performed for tumor assessment every 6 weeks (±7 days) from the first dose of Simmitecan until PD, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or death.|OS (overall survival), Tumor will be evaluated according to RECIST-1.1. CT or MRI can be used for tumor imaging at the investigator's discretion., Imaging examination will be performed for tumor assessment every 6 weeks (±7 days) from the first dose of Simmitecan until PD, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or death.|accumulative excretion rate, Accumulative excretion rate within 0-72 h after the first administration of Simmitecan.
