Tetrathiomolybdate in Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer
Purpose: The aim of this clinical trail is to evaluate Tetrathiomolybdate (TM) in the treatment of hormone refractory prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Tetrathiomolybdate
Time to Progression, To determine the time to progression of prostate cancer in patients with androgen-independent prostate cancer treated with tetrathiomolybdate. Disease progression is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of the target lesions. For disease evaluable only by bone scan, the appearance of new lesions was considered evidence of progression. The development of pain in an existing lesion requiring institution of palliative radiotherapy or prescription narcotics was also considered evidence of progression., 12 weeks
Tetrathiomolybdate or TM, a drug developed for Wilson's Disease, removes copper from the bloodstream. Copper is a key factor in angiogenesis (blood vessel growth)- a process that occurs normally in the body but becomes uncontrolled in cancerous cells. Tetrathiomolybdate essentially wages war against copper, which serves to choke off tumor growth. Realizing the key role of copper in angiogenesis, researchers have begun exploring treatment with Tetrathiomolybdate for different types of cancers. This clinical trial will evaluate the effectiveness of Tetrathiomolybdate in the treatment of patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer. Hormone refractory prostate cancer refers to advanced disease in which the patient no longer responding to conventional hormonal treatment.
