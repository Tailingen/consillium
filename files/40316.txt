18F-mFBG Expression in Neural Crest Tumors and Organs Innervated by the Sympathetic Nervous System
This is a prospective Phase 2 study being performed to document the relationship between 18F-mIBG positron emission tomography (PET) findings in subjects, and expression of the norepinephrine transporter. In addition to collecting safety data for the imaging agent, the study aims to:

* compare the findings against other catacholamine transporters
* evaluate the imaging results at different time points and in different organs
* assess the quality of images with lower doses
* compare the ability to detect neuroblastoma lesions against other imaging agents, and in other tumors

DRUG: 18F-mFBG
Norepinephrine Transporter (NET) expression, Norepinephrine Transporter (NET) expression of the sampled lesion(s), Tissue sampling completed within 22 days of 18F-mFBG imaging|Quantitation of 18F-mFBG uptake in sampled tissue, Standard Uptake Value (SUV) from PET images from specific anatomic regions sampled, Analysis completed within 30 days of 18F-mFBG imaging
Comparison of results at 30 vs. 60 minutes, To evaluate whether 18F-mFBG imaging at 30 min yields results equivalent to those at 60 min post-injection. All image data files and processed/reconstructed PET images will undergo blinding and randomization. 18F-mFBG images will be qualitatively examined by 3 independent readers with no knowledge of the clinical status of the subjects but with access to anatomic cross-sectional images (CT or MRI) acquired as part of the PET exam., 30 days after completion of 18F-mFBG imaging (Day 0)|Quality implications of reduced administered 18F-mFBG activity, To assess the image quality implications of reducing the administered activity of 18F-mFBG. All image data files and processed/reconstructed PET images will undergo blinding and randomization. 18F-mFBG images will be qualitatively examined by 3 independent readers with no knowledge of the clinical status of the subjects but with access to anatomic cross-sectional images (CT or MRI) acquired as part of the PET exam. On-site image assessments will be performed per standard practice for PET imaging at the investigational site. Data for the on-site interpretations will be collected., 30 days after completion of 18F-mFBG imaging (Day 0)|Comparison of 18F-mFBG disease detection at 60 minutes, To determine if 18F-mFBG imaging at 60 min detects more neuroblastoma lesions than 123I-mIBG or 18F-FDG imaging. All image data files and processed/reconstructed PET images will undergo blinding and randomization. 18F-mFBG images will be qualitatively examined by 3 independent readers with no knowledge of the clinical status of the subjects but with access to anatomic cross-sectional images (CT or MRI) acquired as part of the PET exam., 30 days after completion of 18F-mFBG imaging (Day 0)|Occurrence of adverse events in subjects with neuroblastoma, To collect safety data on 18F-mFBG, Up to 24 hours after each administration of 18F-mFBG injection
This is a prospective, Phase 2, open-label study designed to assess the relationship of 18F- mFBG PET imaging findings and NET expression in neuroblastoma tumor (Cohort I) and adrenergically-innervated organs in non-tumor subjects or neural crest tumors other than neuroblastoma (e.g. pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma) (Cohort II). As the mechanism of cellular uptake of benzylguanidine compounds such as mFBG is predominantly via cell-surface NET, there should be a demonstrable relationship between level of NET expression, whether expressed on neuroblastoma tumor, other neural crest tumors, or organs innervated by sympathetic neurons, and 18F-mFBG PET results. Eligible participants will either have: histopathologically established diagnosis of neuroblastoma and a scheduled clinical biopsy or surgery procedure within 21 days after 18F-mFBG PET imaging procedure; or be scheduled to have a clinical biopsy or surgery procedure that will yield a tissue specimen from an adrenergically-innervated organ or a non-neuroblastoma neural crest tumor within 21 days after 18F-mFBG PET imaging. At least one tissue specimen must be expected to be suitable for analysis of NET expression. Every subject will be expected to have at least 1 suitable recent tissue specimen available for NET expression analysis.

Neuroblastoma subjects will also have undergone at least 1 exam with the current standard of care benzylguanidine imaging agent, 123I-mIBG, during the course of clinical care following the original diagnosis of neuroblastoma.

All subjects will undergo 18F-mFBG PET imaging using either clinical PET/CT or PET/MRI equipment. PET studies will be examined on-site by a board-certified nuclear medicine physician or a board-certified radiologist experienced in reading 123I-mIBG and PET scans to ensure technical image quality and information content.
