An Initial Feasibility Study to Integrate MRI Based Brachytherapy and CT/MR Fused INRT in Treatment of Advance Cervical Cancer
Main cause of mortality in cervix cancer is local relapse in the pelvis. Since distant metastasis is quiet rare, increasing local control in the pelvis can directly translate into improvement in survival. Obstacles in front of this approach is the dose limitation to normal organs located in the pelvis adjacent to the tumor. 3-D MRI based EBRT and Brachytherapy will grant safe delivery of more conformal higher doses of radiation to the tumor and allowing sparing of the normal structures.
Integrated MRI Based RT as Standard of Care|Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer
RADIATION: Gold seeds insertion to detect movements at pelvis|RADIATION: Image guided MRI based RT (IMRT+Brachytherapy)
Feasibility parameters, One year
Response rate, acute and late toxicity, local control rate, survival, Five years|Dosimetric comparison between 2D and 3D Brachytherapy treatment planning
A total of 10 patients with a diagnosis of locally advanced cervical carcinoma will be enrolled. After diagnosis and written informed consent, patients will undergo investigations prior to treatment planning, including CT imaging as per standard of care. In addition, patients will have an MRI of the pelvis + PET scan + EUA and gold seeds insertion to verify pelvic organs movement and EB-IMRT with daily cone beam CT. Brachytherapy treatment planning will be based on MRI imaging with the applicator in situ.
