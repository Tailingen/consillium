PAKT: AZD5363 in Combination With Paclitaxel in Triple-Negative Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer
PAKT was an investigator-led, placebo-controlled, randomized phase II trial performed in 42 academic medical centers in the United Kindom, South Korea, France, Hungary, Romania, and Georgia. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive paclitaxel plus capivasertib or paclitaxel plus placebo. Stratification was by number of metastatic sites (\< 3 v ≥ 3) and interval from the end of prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy (≤ 12 v \> 12 months v no prior chemotherapy).

Paclitaxel was administered as a once-per-week intravenous infusion of 90 mg/m2 over approximately 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day treatment cycle. Capivasertib 400 mg or placebo was administered orally twice per day on an intermittent weekly dosing schedule, with treatment on days 2 to 5 of weeks 1, 2, and 3 within each 28-day cycle. All treatments were continued until disease progression, development of unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. If paclitaxel treatment was discontinued before disease progression, patients could continue to receive capivasertib or placebo alone. In case of adverse events (AEs), capivasertib or placebo could be reduced to 320 mg twice per day and subsequently to 240 mg twice per day. Capivasertib or placebo could be interrupted for up to 4 weeks for toxicity.

Tumor assessments included computed tomography scanning or magnetic resonance imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis at baseline, every 8 weeks during treatment, and at progression. Patients who discontinued treatment for any reason other than progression were required to follow the same schedule of assessments until progression, initiation of another treatment, death, or withdrawal of consent.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: AZD5363|DRUG: Placebo
Progression-free survival, Progression-free survival, defined as the time from the date of randomisation to the date of first documented tumour progression (using RECIST 1.1) or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Date of randomisation to date of first tumour progression or death (this can range on average between 3 weeks and 32 weeks).
