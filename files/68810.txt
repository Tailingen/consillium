Netrin-1 & Hepatocellular Carcinoma HCC
Netrin-1 is a dependence receptor ligand participating in the pathology of several cancer types. It is up-regulated in chronic liver diseases, cirrhosis and HCC. We hypothesize that netrin-1 may play a detrimental role in HCC. The goal of this project is to characterize netrin-1 signals in HCC samples with ad hoc controls, to investigate the benefit of capturing netrin-1 in preclinical models of HCC and to try to define patients groups the most likely to benefit from this targeting approach in the clinic.
HCC
PROCEDURE: Quantification of netrin-1 signals by antibody-based approaches
Netrin-1 expression patterns in HCC samples, Netrin-1 expression levels will be quantified by immunoblotting with ad hoc internal standards. Positivity threshold by IHC will be evaluated using ad hoc positive and negative control tissues. The densitometry approach will be used., Outcome measure is to be performed after surgery of the tumors (at least 1 year later). It has no impact on the patient's care.
