REduced Frequency ImmuNE Checkpoint Inhibition in Cancers
The REFINE trial aims to asses whether giving an immunotherapy drug less-often to patients with advanced cancer, results in fewer side effects whilst continuing to be an effective treatment. The question will be assessed in different tumour types by means of different cohorts within an overarching trial protocol.
Renal Cell Carcinoma|Melanoma
DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Progression Free Survival, Time to event, 1 year 9 months follow-up
Overall survival, Measured from date of randomisation until date of death or last follow-up, 1 year 9 months follow-up|Quality of Life (QoL) - Generic, EQ-5D-5L questionnaire to assess generic quality of life, 1 year 9 months follow-up|Treatment-related toxicity, Measured using severity of all AEs and/or ARs (serious and non-serious) with the toxicity scales in NCI CTCAE v5.0 reviewed at the end of each stage and reported until trial closure, 1 year 9 months follow-up|Mean incremental cost per patient, Measured using unit costs from NHS Reference Costs, Personal Social Services Research Unit (PSSRU) and British National Formulary (BNF) prices, and applying them to health and social care resource use collected via the Client Service Receipt Inventory (CSRI), intervention medication CRF, additional treatment logs, and concomitant medication CRF, every 12 weeks starting at baseline, calculating the cost and taking the difference between arms to calculate mean incremental cost per patient (bootstrapped regression, adjusting for baseline values, jointly with QALYs)., 1 year 9 months follow-up|Mean incremental quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) per patient, Measured using utility scores calculated from EQ-5D-5L questionnaire responses collected every 12 weeks starting at baseline, and applying them to the relevant period of follow-up to calculate quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and taking the difference between arms to calculate mean incremental QALYs per patient (bootstrapped regression, adjusting for baseline values, jointly with costs)., 1 year 9 months follow-up|Cost-utility analysis, Assessing cost-effectiveness of reduced vs. standard frequency administration with summary result expressed as the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), i.e. incremental cost per QALY gained, calculated by dividing incremental costs by incremental QALYs; with sensitivity analysis expressed via cost-effectiveness planes and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves to indicate probability that the intervention is cost-effective compared to the standard of care for a range of values of the cost-effectiveness threshold, 1 year 9 months follow-up|Feasibility of recruitment to each cohort, Measured by sites completing screening logs to identify number of treatment cycles, 1 year 9 months follow-up|Quality of Life (QoL) - Cancer-specific, EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire to assess cancer-specific quality of life, 1 year 9 months follow-up
In stage I eligible participants will be randomly assigned to either the standard interval (either 4 or 6 weeks) or the extended interval (either 8 or 12 weeks) following an initial 12 weeks of standard of care immunotherapy. Disease recurrence and survival will be assessed, along with quality of life and health economic outcomes. The trial includes a feasibility outcome by which recruitment feasibility will be assessed.

Immunotherapy drugs are a standard treatment option for advanced kidney cancer, melanoma, and some lung cancers. These drugs work by stimulating the body's own immune system to fight against cancer cells. Clinical trials have proven the effectiveness of immunotherapy drugs, such as ipilimumab, nivolumab or pembrolizumab, in the treatment of different cancers. However the best way to give these drugs is not known.
