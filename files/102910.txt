A Clinical Study of CAR-T Cells in the Treatment of Relapsed and Refractory Hematological Malignancies
This project is intended to provide CAR-T cell therapy products for patients with severely life-threatening relapsed and refractory hematological malignancies. These patients have been previously treated sufficiently, currently have no other treatment methods available, and do not meet the inclusion criteria of other clinical trial projects in the process of subject recruitment or meet their exclusion criteria. This project is designed to meet the urgent clinical needs of individual patients.
