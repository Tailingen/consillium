Effect of Terlipressinum on the Portal Vein Pressure of Patients With Liver Tumor After Liver Resection
In this study, investigators aim to screen out the patients with portal hypertension by monitoring intraoperative PVP, and to decide the effect of Terlipressinum on the portal pressure after liver resection.
Portal Vein Pressure
DRUG: Terlipressinum
Change of Portal vein pressure, The change of the portal vein pressure before and after the use of Terlipressinum., 8 months
Incidence of hepatic dysfunction after hepatectomy, 8 months|Incidence of acute renal dysfunction after hepatectomy, 8 months|Adverse effect of Terlipressurinum, 8 months
Liver resection is a common treatment for liver tumors. But the incidence of postoperative liver failure after hepatectomy is as high as 9-18.6%, which results in relatively high mortality rate . Portal hypertension is considered as a contraindication for hepatectomy according to the guidelines of the European Society of Hepatology and the American Society of Hepatology. Recent studies found that patients with portal hypertension were more likely to have persistent liver failure and shorter long-term survival after liver resection operation, compared to patients without portal hypertension.

Most of liver cancer patients in China have disease backgroud including chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis. Among liver cancer patients, of which function is Child A or B and have indication for liver resection, 25% of them have portal hypertension.
