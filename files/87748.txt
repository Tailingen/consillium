Thermal Imaging for Evaluation of the Cervix
When screening results for cervical premalignant lesions are positive, colposcopy is recommended. This is highly sensitive screening method. However, specificity of the test is of low.

Thus, a technology that improves the accuracy of the colposcopic exam is needed.

This is a feasibility study with the goal of examining the performance of a thermal imaging camera in the detection of cervical malignant and premalignant lesions.
