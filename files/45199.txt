Allogeneic Engineered Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HCT) Lacking the CD33 Protein, and Post-HCT Treatment With Mylotarg, for Patients With CD33+ AML or MDS
This is a Phase 1/2a, multicenter, open-label, first-in-human (FIH) study of VOR33 in participants with AML or MDS who are undergoing human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT).

BIOLOGICAL: VOR33|DRUG: Mylotarg
Incidence of neutrophil engraftment, Cumulative incidence of patients who achieve neutrophil engraftment (first day of 3 consecutive days of absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥500 cells/mm3) by Day 28., Day 28
Time to neutrophil engraftment, Time to neutrophil engraftment after HCT from Day 0; calculated as the first day of 3 consecutive laboratory values obtained on separate days where the ANC is ≥500 cells/mm3., Up to approximately 28 days|Time to platelet recovery, Time to platelet recovery defined as first day of a sustained platelet count \>20,000/ μL with no platelet transfusion in the preceding seven days., Up to approximately 60 days|Incidence of acute GVHD Grade (G) G2-G4 and G3-G4, Up to 24 months|Incidence of chronic GVHD (all and moderate-severe), Up to 24 months|Incidence of primary and secondary graft failure, Incidence of primary and secondary graft failure measured by day 28 post HCT.

High risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) frequently relapses despite hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT). Post-HCT targeted therapy to reduce relapse is limited by toxicity to the engrafted cells. VOR33, an allogeneic CRISPR/Cas9 genome-edited hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) therapy product, lacking the CD33 protein, is being investigated for participants with CD33+ AML or MDS at high risk for relapse after HCT to allow post-HCT targeting of residual CD33+ acute AML cells using Mylotarg™ without toxicity to engrafted VOR33 cells. Participants will undergo a myeloablative HCT with matched related or unrelated donor CD34+-selected hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) engineered to remove CD33 expression (VOR33 product). Mylotarg™ will be given after engraftment for up to 4 cycles. The primary endpoint assessing safety of VOR33 will be the incidence of successful engraftment at 28 days. Part 1 of this study will evaluate the safety of escalating Mylotarg™ dose levels to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Part 2 will expand the number of participants to evaluate the Mylotarg™ RP2D.
