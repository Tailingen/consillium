Clinical and Pathological Characteristics of Women With Ovarian Cancers in Syria
the goal of this observational study is to describe ovarian cancer epidemiology and characteristics in Syrian women, especially during the war to do more research in the future about the risk factors of ovarian cancer.

Ovarian cancer (OC) is the eighth most common cause of death worldwide, and current studies show that the death numbers caused by it will rise dramatically in the coming years. As the epidemiological features of the cancer may vary, studying these different characteristics can help us improve treatment outcomes and add preventive measures. In addition, giving special attention to these features in developing countries, or countries undergoing crisis, will help us understand the associated risk factors in these regions.
