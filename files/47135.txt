P-BCMA-ALLO1 Allogeneic CAR-T Cells in the Treatment of Subjects With Multiple Myeloma
Phase 1 study comprised of open-label, dose escalation, multiple cohorts of P-BCMA-ALLO1 allogeneic T stem cell memory (Tscm) CAR-T cells in subjects with relapsed / refractory Multiple Myeloma (RRMM).
Multiple Myeloma
BIOLOGICAL: P-BCMA-ALLO1 CAR-T cells|DRUG: Rimiducid
Phase 1 Part 1: Assess the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of P-BCMA-ALLO1 based on dose limiting toxicities (DLT), Rate of dose limiting toxicities (DLT), Baseline through Day 28|Phase 1 Part 2: Assess the safety and tolerability of P-BCMA-ALLO1 when administered as a fixed dose of cells., Frequency and severity of adverse events, including cytokine release syndrome., Baseline through 36 months|Phase 1b: The effect of cell dose and study arm to guide selection of Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D)., Incidence and severity of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) events graded using American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) criteria (Lee, 2019)., Baseline through 36 months
The safety of P-BCMA-ALLO1, Incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events, Baseline through 15 years|The anti-myeloma effect of P-BCMA-ALLO1 (ORR) in Phase 1 Parts 1 and 2, According to the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma: Overall Response Rate (ORR) - Percentage of patients with complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), or partial response (PR), Baseline through 15 years|The anti-myeloma effect of P-BCMA-ALLO1 (TTR), According to the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma: Time to Response (TTR) - Time to complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), or partial response (PR) to progressive disease, Baseline through 15 years|The anti-Myeloma effect of P-BCMA-ALLO1 (DOR), According to the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma: Duration of Response - Time from complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), or partial response (PR) to progressive disease, Baseline through 15 years|The anti-Myeloma effect of P-BCMA-ALLO1 (PFS), According to the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma: Progression Free Survival (PFS) - Time from P-BCMA-ALLO1 treatment to progressive disease, Baseline through 15 years|The anti-Myeloma effect of P-BCMA-ALLO1 (OS), According to the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma: Overall Survival (OS) - Duration of survival from time of treatment with P-BCMA-ALLO1, Baseline through 15 years
Phase 1/1b study: Phase 1 Part 1 is a weight-based dose escalation following a 3+3 design of dose-escalating cohorts. Phase 1 Part 2 includes administration at fixed doses. After enrollment, subjects may receive a lymphodepletion therapy regimen before administration of allogeneic CAR-T cells, administered as a single or multiple dose(s). Treated subjects will undergo serial measurements of safety, tolerability and response. Rimiducid may be administered as indicated. Phase 1b of the study will undergo further expansion of cohorts/arms from Phase 1 Parts 1 or 2 or an intermediate dose between cohort levels.
