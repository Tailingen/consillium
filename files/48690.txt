Monopolar Radiofrequency Ablation Using a Dual Switching System and a Separable Clustered Electrode (OctopusÂ®)
Increasing ablative zone is an essential part to improve technical success and long term outcome in patient treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA).

A combination of dual switching system and separable clustered electrode has been reported to create large ablative zone in preclinical study.

Based on preclinical study, the investigators conducted a preliminary study in eligible 60 patients to measure whether this combination (dual switching system and separable clustered electrode) improves technical success rate and local tumor progression rate over a year, in comparison with historical control group.
