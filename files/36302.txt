Maintenance Zanzalintinib With Etoposide After HDCT in GCT
This is an open label, single arm phase I/II trial of maintenance zanzalintinib in combination with oral etoposide in patients with relapsed GCT treated with HDCT and PBSCT with a safety lead-in cohort in patients with relapsed, refractory metastatic GCT.
Germ Cell Tumor
DRUG: Zanzalintinib|DRUG: Etoposide Capsule
Phase 1: Rate of hematologic toxicity, Rate of hematologic toxicity including neutropenia, anemia, or thrombocytopenia requiring intervention (transfusions or antibiotics), 28 days|Phase 1: Rate of non-hematologic toxicity, Rate of non-hematologic toxicity, 28 days|Phase II: 12-month Progression Free Survival, 12-month PFS based on investigator determination of tumor progression (clinical, radiographic, and/or tumor markers including AFP and hCG), 12 months
Phase II: 12-month Overall Survival (OS), 24-month OS as determined from time of registration to death from any cause, 24 months post time of registration|Phase II: Incidence of Adverse Events, Toxicity measured by the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0 and need for treatment delay, dose reduction, or early discontinuation., Start of treatment until end of treatment safety assessments (up to 2 years)
This prospective, phase I/II trial will initially enroll 9 patients with relapsed, refractory metastatic disease. Three doses of zanzalintinib will be evaluated for toxicity. The patients will receive zanzalintinib orally daily continuously in combination with oral standard of care etoposide daily for 21 days out of 28 day cycles until time of progression or toxicity. The DLT period is 1 cycle of 28 days. We will employ the Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design to find the MTD.
