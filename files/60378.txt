Tislelizumab in Combination with Chemotherapy ± Radiotherapy for Extensive-Stage Oligometastatic Small Cell Lung Cancer.
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn the efficacy and safety of tislelizumab in combination with chemotherapy(etoposide/cisplatin ) ± concurrent radiotherapy for extensive-stage oligometastatic small cell lung cancer. 64 Patients with Extensive-Stage Oligometastatic Small Cell Lung Cancer will be randomly divided into the experimental group (tislelizumab combined with chemotherapy and radiotherapy) and the control group (tislelizumab combined with chemotherapy).Researchers will compare treatment efficacy and safety between the two groups.
