Hemostatic Profiles of Endocrine Therapies for Breast Cancer
The aim of this prospective cohort study is to evaluate the modifications of the biological hemostatic profile associated with the use of endocrine therapy in women with breast cancer (tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors).
Breast Neoplasms|Venous Thromboembolism
Change in thrombin generation, including APC sensitivity ratio, three months
Change in levels of coagulation factors, Levels of the following coagulation factors will be measured and compared before and after use of endocrine treatments: antithrombin, protein C, protein S, D-dimer, fibrinogen, F VII, F VIII, three months|Change in fibrinolytic time, three months
In this cohort study, women with breast cancer and an indication for endocrine therapy will be prospectively enrolled. At the 1st visit (before the start of endocrine therapy (tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitor)) and at the 2nd visit (at \~3 months after the start of treatment), demographical / clinical data and blood samples will be collected. We will evaluate the hemostatic biological profiles associated with the use of endocrine therapy by comparing hemostatic biomarkers before and during its use.
