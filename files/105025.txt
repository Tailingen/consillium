Sequential Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Soft Tissue Sarcoma
Nearly half of patients with high-grade, localized soft tissue sarcoma (STS) of extremities and trunk wall develop disease recurrence after local therapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy with ifosfamide and doxorubicin may improve long-term disease-free survival, but the benefit of adjuvant treatment is limited and predictive factors for treatment response are lacking. The aim of this study is to explore sequential treatment with ifosfamide and doxorubicin in a neoadjuvant setting and to investigate biomarkers predictive of treatment response.
Soft Tissue Sarcoma
DRUG: Ifosfamide|DRUG: Doxorubicin
Overall response rate, Partial or complete response using RECIST v1.1, Up to 16 weeks
Incidence of treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0 and dose reductions (safety and tolerability), Number and type of adverse events, serious adverse events, dose reductions and discontinuation due to toxicity, Until 30 days after last dose of study treatment|Correlation between TP53 mutation assessed by sequencing of tumor DNA and overall response, To investigate if TP53 mutations assessed by sequencing of tumor DNA predict response to high-dose alkylating chemotherapy and/or sequential doxorubicin monotherapy in STS, Up to 16 weeks
Disease-free survival, Up to 10 years after completion of study treatment|Overall survival, Up to 10 years after completion of study treatment|Health-related quality of life, To assess change from baseline in the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) scores during treatment, Up to 10 years after completion of study treatment|Number of patients who experience a change in the extent of the planned surgical procedure due to study treatment, To investigate if the extent of the surgical procedure is changed due to neoadjuvant treatment, From baseline and up to 6 months
