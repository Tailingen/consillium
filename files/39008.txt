Perioperative Imatinib Mesylate in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor
Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Perioperative imatinib mesylate may shrink the tumor and may reduce the chance of relapse after surgery. This phase II trial is studying the effectiveness of perioperative imatinib mesylate in treating patients with locally advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor.
Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor
DRUG: imatinib mesylate|PROCEDURE: conventional surgery
Rate of disease recurrence at 2 years, 4 years
Rates of objective response (complete, partial, and stable), 2 years|Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients., 3 years
Open-label trial in patients with locally advanced GISTs admitted to Department of Surgery, Beijing Cancer Hospital and Institute between April 2010 and May 2013 was carried out prospectively. Patients were planned to be treated with imatinib for duration of 6 months followed by surgical resection. Postoperative imatinib was planned to be administrated for 1.5 years. The primary end point was recurrent free survival (RFS) at 2 years; the secondary end points included objective response rate (ORR), surgical outcomes and drug safety.
