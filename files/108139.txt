ABCB1 SNPs as Predictors of PIPN
The study aim is to determine the allele frequencies of 1236 G\>A and 3435 G\>A in ABCB1 and study their association with the incidence and severity of paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy while adjusting for other baseline covariates in Egyptian patients. Additionally, the study aimed at fitting and validating logistic regression models with the aforementioned SNPs evaluated in additive, dominant, overdominant, and recessive genetic models and performing diagnostics for the best model in terms of internal validity.
