A Single Arm Phase II Study of ADjuvant Endocrine Therapy, Pertuzumab, and Trastuzumab for Patients With Anatomic Stage I Hormone Receptor-positive, HER2-positive Breast Cancer
This research study is studying a combination of HER2-directed therapies (trastuzumab and pertuzumab) and hormonal therapy as a treatment after surgery for hormone receptor positive breast cancer.

The study drugs involved in this study are:

* A combination of trastuzumab and pertuzumab given as an injection under the skin (PHESGO)
* Hormonal (endocrine) Treatment

Patient-reported hormonal therapy adherence, assessed by Voils questionnaire. Responses to survey items will be summarized using means or proportions depending on the nature of the questions., 5 years|FACT B, The FACT-B includes the FACT-G, a 27-item generic cancer questionnaire and a 10- item breast cancer specific module. Responses to survey items will be summarized by means or proportions depending on the nature of the items, baseline to 18 Months|Rotterdam symptom checklist,, The Activity Level Scale Domain from the RSCL is an 8-item scale designed to measure whether the respondent can perform a series of activities at the present time. Items are summed to produce an overall score, with higher scores representing better functioning.

Responses to survey items will be summarized by means or proportions, baseline to 18 Months|WPAI-SHP-Work Productivity, The WPAI was created as a patient-reported quantitative assessment of the amount of absenteeism, presenteeism and daily activity impairment attributable to general health (WPAI:GH) or a specific health problem (WPAI:SHP). The 6 questions in the WPAI questionnaire were generated from three main sources Responses to survey items will be summarized by means or proportions depending on the nature of the items, baseline to 18 Months|COST-Financial Toxicity, There is increasing recognition of the profound importance of the financial strain on patients created by cancer diagnosis and therapies. The COST (Comprehensive Score for financial Toxicity) measure has been developed and validated as a mechanism to assess financial stress related to cancer diagnosis and treatment Responses to survey items will be summarized by means or proportions, baseline to 18 Months|Patient Acceptance of subcutaneous therapy (HPASQ-SC), The HPASQ-SC (Appendix C) is a tool to measure patient-reported outcomes regarding patient acceptance of subcutaneous therapy. It was developed and underwent validity testing in a cohort of patients receiving subcutaneous rituximab for lymphoma. The HPASQ-SC contains questions related to two main concepts (treatment satisfaction and impact of treatment administration) and eight sub-concepts: overall preference/satisfaction; convenience; confidence; bothersome-ness; physical impact; psychological impact; impact on activities of daily life; and impact on the interaction with healthcare providers.21

The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including laboratory evaluations, physical exams, questionnaires, and follow up visits.

* Participants will receive HER2-directed treatment for 1 year and hormonal therapy for approximately 5 years.
* It is expected that about 375 people will take part in this research study.

This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug combination to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drug combination is being studied.

The drugs trastuzumab and pertuzumab are both monoclonal antibodies, which are disease-fighting proteins made by cloned immune cells. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and trastuzumab + pertuzumab subcutaneous fixed dose combination (PHESGO) as treatment for HER2 positive breast cancer. The FDA has also approved hormonal therapies as treatment for hormone receptor positive breast cancer.
