A Study of MRG002 in the Treatment of Patients With HER2-positive Unresectable Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer
The primary objective of Phase II is to evaluate the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of MRG002 in patients with HER2-positive, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. The primary objective of Phase III is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MRG002 versus Trastuzumab Emtansine (T-DM1) in patients with HER2-positive unresectable locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have been previously treated with trastuzumab (or a biosimilar) and an anti-HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (anti-HER2-TKI) and have progressed on or after the most recent therapy.

Progression Free Survival (PFS) by Independent Review Committee (IRC), PFS is defined as the duration from the start of treatment to the onset of tumor progression or death of any cause assessed by Independent Review Committee (IRC) according to RECIST v1.1., Baseline to study completion（up to 36 months）
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of patients with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST v1.1., Baseline to study completion (up to 36 months)|Duration of Response (DoR), DoR is defined as the time from first documented objective response (CR/PR) to the first onset of tumor progression or death of any nonsurgical cause., Baseline to study completion (up to 36 months)|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the proportion of subjects achieving CR, PR, and stable disease (SD) after treatment., Baseline to study completion (up to 36 months)|PFS by investigator, PFS is defined as the duration from the start of treatment to the onset of tumor progression or death of any cause., Baseline to study completion (up to 36 months)|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the duration from the start of treatment to death of any cause., Baseline to study completion (up to 36 months)|Adverse Events (AEs), Any reaction, side effect, or untoward event that occurs during the course of the clinical trial whether or not the event is considered related to the study drug., Baseline to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment|Concentration-time curve, Plot of drug concentration changing with time after drug administration., Baseline to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment|Immunogenicity, The proportion of patients with positive ADA immunogenicity results., Baseline to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment
