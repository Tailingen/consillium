A Safety and Tolerability Study of SCH 721015 in Patients With Transitional Cell Carcinoma of the Bladder (Study P03816)
The purpose of this first-in-human study is to determine the safety and tolerability of SCH 721015 in subjects with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.

A nonrandomized, open-label, rising-dose, parallel-group, multi-center study of SCH 721015 in patients with papillary bladder cancer, or carcinoma in situ that is refractory to Bacillus Calmette-Guerin. Subjects will receive a single intravesical administration of SCH 721015 with SCH 209702 in a total volume of 75 mL with a 1-hour dwell time. Subjects who at 3 months post administration demonstrate a complete response (CR on cystoscopy/biopsy and cytology) and who did not experience dose-limiting toxicity will be allowed to receive a second intravesical administration at the same dose level.
