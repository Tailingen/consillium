Study of Irinotecan Liposome Injection in Patients With Advanced Breast Cance
This study is an open-label, single-arm, phase I study of irinotecan liposome injection in patients with advanced breast cancer. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of irinotecan liposome injection in patients with advanced breast cancer.

This is an open-label, single-arm, phase I study with a dose-escalation phase (part 1) and a dose-expansion phase (part 2). In part 1, patients will receive irinotecan liposome injection (CSPC) at the initial starting dose until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Dosages will be escalated by certain increments in subsequent cohorts. Once the appropriate dose has been established in part 1, patients will be enrolled into two expansion cohorts in part 2.
