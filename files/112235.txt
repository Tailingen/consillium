Percutaneous Irreversible Electroporation to Treat Liver Cancer Close to the Gallbladder
The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of irreversible electroporation for unresectable Hepatic carcinoma close to the gallbladder, also Progress Free Survival (PFS) will be recorded.
Hepatic Carcinoma
DEVICE: NanoKnife
Treatment efficacy as measured by modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria by Computed Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging., 30 days (+/- 3 days) post treatment
Safety using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 3.0 criteria., Immediately post treatment to 2 years post treatment
Progress free survival(PFS), 24months
Hepatic carcinoma is the fifth most common cancer worldwide and a large proportion of patients are unsuitable for tumor resection because of factors such as poor hepatic reserve(cirrhosis), multicentric tumors or near vital structures such as vessels, diaphragmatic dome and gallbladder. Direct ablative treatments include radiofrequency ablation, microwave (MW) ablation and cryotherapy and irreversible electroporation had been used successful as a therapeutic choice for unresectable patients. At the same time，Irreversible electroporation(IRE)，which was applied with a novel ablation technology, can induce tissue necrosis by utilizing short pulses of high-voltage electrical energy. The technique also had many advantages, including Short ablation time, preservation of vital structures within IRE-ablated zone, avoidance of heat/cold-sink effect, complete ablation with well-demarcated margin and real-time monitoring of IRE ablation.
