Study of IL2 in Combination With Zoledronic Acid in Patients With Kidney Cancer
This study is being done to see if we can improve the response of Interleukin-2 by adding Zoledronic acid. The effectiveness of the combination of drugs in kidney cancer is unknown and will be investigated in this study. In particular, this study will evaluate the effect of this combination on kidney cancer and will also examine the safety and side effects of IL-2 with Zoledronic acid.
Kidney Cancer
DRUG: IL2|DRUG: Zoledronic acid
Number of Subjects With Antitumor Response With Low-dose Interleukin-2 in Combination With Zoledronic Acid, Anti-tumor response was measured per RECIST criteria (V1.0) and assessed by chest/abdomen/pelvis CT: Complete Response (CR), disappearance of all target lessions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions; Stable Response (SD), Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started., CT scans obtained at baseline, then every 2 cycles
Number of Participants With Overall Survival and Progression-free Survival at 24 Weeks, All 12 patients were followed for survival until death. 8 participants who received more than one cycle of treatment and who were considered evaluable for response were followed until time to progression. Disease progression was determined by CT scans of the chest/abdomen/pelvis obtained every 2 cycles and based on RECIST version 1.0. Progression is defined using RECIST (V1.0) at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD)of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions, Time frame is from study entry until time to disease progression and time to death, up to 50 months|Number of Participants With Toxicities, Patients were observed for toxicities. The National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria Version 2.0 was used to categorize and report adverse events., Baseline to 30 days after last dose of study treatment|Number of Participants With Immunologic Responses, Blood was collected to analyze T-cell populations from all patients prior to treatment on day 1 of cycles 1 and 2, and days 4 and 8 of cycles 1 and 2. Changes in gamma delta T-cell population and CD3 T-cell populations were reported., baseline to cycle 2 day 8
The purpose of this research is to evaluate the antitumor response of low-dose Interleukin-2 in combination with Zoledronic acid on subjects with previously untreated, unresectable metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Also, the study will assess the tolerability, safety, pharmacodynamic effects, and immunologic effects of low-dose Interleukin-2 in combination with Zoledronic acid on angiogenesis inhibition and anti-metastatic potential by measuring serum/plasma angiogenic/metastatic factor levels and by quantitating changes in cytokine expression, antigen-specific T-cell immune responses, and peripheral gd T-cell frequency and function.
