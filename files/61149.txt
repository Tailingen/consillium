Salvage Radiotherapy Combined With Hormonotherapy in Oligometastatic Pelvic Node Relapses of Prostate Cancer
There is an increasing number of reports describing the existence of a proportion of prostate cancer patients who present with a reduced number of metastases (\<5 lesions) at relapse. This oligometastatic status has also been recognized in other tumor types such as melanoma, soft tissue sarcoma, liver, lung, and breast cancer, and has influenced the management of these malignancies in that a more radical treatment such as surgical resection has been employed. Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography (PET-CT) studies with tracers such as choline or acetate are reliable tools to help with the diagnosis of oligometastatic disease after biochemical treatment failure in prostate cancer. An aggressive treatment combining androgen depriving therapy (ADT) and and high-dose irradiation to the oligometastatic lesions, as detected by PET-CT, may be proposed for these oligometastatic patients. Such a treatment strategy may hypothetically succeed to prolong the failure-free interval between two consecutive ADT courses, or even cure selected patients with limited metastatic burden. In this study the investigators plan to assess biochemical or clinical relapse-free survival at 2 years of prostate cancer with 1-5 oligometastases treated concomitantly with high-dose conformal Radiation Therapy and LH-RH agonists.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: ELIGARD
biochemical or clinical relapse-free survival at 2 years, The biochemical or clinical relapse is defined by:

* a PSA level greater than the PSA before treatment, with two successive elevations in the same laboratory
* and / or an increase in the number of metastatic sites at the evaluation visit, 2 years
gastrointestinal toxicities after radiation, main toxicities expected are : proctitis, ileitis, diarrhea, 1 month (acute toxicities) and 2 years (late toxicities)|Local relapse versus distant relapse, Medical imaging exams will be performed every 6 month for 2 years, and then every years until patient progression, expected up to 24 month|Overall survival, overall survival will be assessed every year during patient life, every year
1. Hormonotherapy

   Hormone therapy is recommended Eligard 45 mg acting for 6 months. It will be ideally administered the day of start of radiation therapy or within 3 months before the first day of radiotherapy.

   Nevertheless, free prescription is left to investigators. When using other hormonal strategies (anti-androgen agonists, LHRH antagonists or LHRH), an administration for six months will be critical.
2. Radiotherapy

Conformational Radiotherapy techniques in Intensity-Modulated (IMRT)

2.1) Doses prescribed

* PTV1 PTV5 to 66 Gy in 30 fractions of 2.2 Gy
* PTV Pelvis: 54 Gy in 30 fractions of 1.8 Gy
* PTV Loge 60 Gy in 30 fractions of 2 Gy 6 Gy A complement of 3 in two additional fractions Gy may be delivered across the lodge PTV.
* PTV Relapse Lodge: In addition to treating the PTV Lodge, additional radiation of 6 Gy in 3 fractions of 2 Gy may be made to bring the total dose of 72 Gy in 36 fractions of 2 Gy.

2.2) Treatment

Radiation Guided by a picture (IGRT) will be performed daily. This daily recalibration will be based at least on bone structures. It will be possible to readjust the nodal structures.
