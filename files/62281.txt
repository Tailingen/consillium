Bovine Reinforcement in Stomach, Colorectal and Lung Operation
The primary purpose of this prospective, randomized multicenter center study is to evaluate and compare the outcomes of stomach,colorectal and lung anastomoses reinforced with a bioabsorbable staple line reinforcement material compared with standard non-reinforced techniques with respect to the incidence of postoperative hemorrage rate, anastomotic leakage, if applicable.
Rectal Cancer Stage III|Lung Cancer Stage III
DEVICE: Bioabsorbable Staple Line Reinforcemen
Proportion of Subjects Who Experience a hemorrage, The primary endpoint for the study is the proportion of subjects who experience a hemorrage through 10 min post procedure., 10 min
Proportion of Subjects Who Experience a Clinical and/or Radiologic Anastomotic Leak, The primary endpoint for the study is the proportion of subjects who experience a clinical and/or radiologic anastomotic leak through 1-3 months post procedure., 1-3 months
This is a randomized prospective trial that compares the use of Cingular Bioabsorbable Staple Line Reinforcement to standard stapling techniques in tissue resections. The potential exists to utilize staple line reinforcement as a means of lowering the rate of post-operative hemorrage rate, anastomotic leakage.
