Phase II of Naltrexone in Hormone-Refractory Metastatic Breast Cancer
RATIONALE: Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Naltrexone may fight breast cancer by blocking the use of estrogen by the tumor cells. Naltrexone may also stop the growth of breast cancer by impairing blood flow to the tumor.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well naltrexone works in treating women with metastatic breast cancer that is no longer responsive to previous hormone therapy.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: naltrexone|PROCEDURE: PET scan
Disease Response, A response is the number of participants whose tumor demonstrated a decrease in FDG uptake (SUV) by 50% or greater in at least one of the metastatic sites as measured by PET imaging at the end of 4 weeks of treatment compared to baseline., Week 4
Median Time to Event, First time when maximum SUV is higher than that at baseline within 1 year of study entry., From Baseline to 1 Year
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine the efficacy of naltrexone in women with hormone-refractory, metastatic breast cancer as measured by serial fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography-CT scans.

Secondary

* Determine the safety of naltrexone in these patients.
* Determine the median time to event (first time when maximum specific uptake values is higher than that at baseline) within 1 year of study entry.

OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

Patients receive oral naltrexone once daily for 8 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 8 weeks, patients may continue naltrexone off study at the discretion of the physician.

Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography-CT scans at baseline, week 4, week 8, and periodically thereafter.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to 1 year.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study.
