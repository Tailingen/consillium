Impact of Covid-19 Pandemic on Management of Head and Neck Cancers
Since its emergence in late December 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has spread rapidly, causing a global health crisis. The disease caused by this highly contagious respiratory virus is called COVID-19. At the beginning of August 2020, there were more than 194,000 confirmed cases in France - including approximately 16,000 cases in the Hauts-de-France area - and more than 30,300 deaths.

Cancer patients are generally susceptible to respiratory infections, and CoV-2-SARS is no exception. Early Chinese studies reported a higher rate of CoV-2-SARS infection in people with cancer (or a history of cancer) than in the general population, with more severe forms and with an increased risk if surgery or chemotherapy is performed in the month prior to infection. The purpose of this study is to describe the management modalities of patients with H\&N (Head and Neck) cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Maxillofacial Surgery Department of CHU Amiens-Picardie.
