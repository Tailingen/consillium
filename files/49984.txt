HIghly MetAstatic Life Prolonging Therapy-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Role of Stereotactic Radiotherapy for Bone and Lymph Node Metastases (HIMARS)
The investigators propose redefining this concept by focusing on volume rather than the number of metastases. To achieve this, the investigators aim to determine the Maximum Tolerated Volume (MTV) of metastatic lesions treatable with SRT (Stereotaxic radiotherapy) in a phase 1 study. In this study, the investigators will recruit patients with high-volume metastatic disease in bones or lymph nodes and progressively irradiate a volume-escalated subset of the total lesions. The selection will prioritize lesions at higher risk of causing pain or complications, such as fractures, spinal compression, or vascular compression. The investigators hypothesis is that SRT targeting multiple metastases (with a total volume ≤ MTV) will extend the duration without refractory pain and/or tumor-related complications in patients with castration-resistant and chemo-refractory prostate cancer.

RADIATION: Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT)
Maximum tolerated volume (MTV), The MTV will be defined as the highest volume that can be treated with an acute toxicity of grade \< 3 (CTCAE V5.0 scale) in one third of patient and will allow us to determine the recommended phase II volume under the assumption that higher volumes are likely to be more toxic. The maximum tolerated Volume (MTV) is defined as the volume at which 2 Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) were observed among 3 to 6 patients.

DLT are considered as:

* Death clearly related to irradiation
* Intractable pain despite oral or intravenous opioids and/or corticosteroids (EVA \> 4 and increase of 2 from EVA baseline)
* Any new grade ≥ 3 toxicity (CTCAE V5.0 scale) compared to baseline among:

  * Anemia
  * Febrile Neutropenia
  * Hemorrhage within grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia
  * Any gastro-intestinal-related disorder
  * Any genito-urinary-related disorder
  * Pneumonitis Bone marrow reserve will be determined by CT-base automatic tool., 12 weeks
Number of toxicity related to radiotherapy as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, Acute (≤ 12 weeks) and late (\>12 weeks) toxicity will be evaluated according to NCI-CTCAE v5 grading, through study completion|Recommended volume for irradiation by SRT for phase-II, The Recommended Volume (RV) corresponds to the volume of the level immediately below the MTV. This Recommended Volume for irradiation by SRT will then be applied for phase 2., 12 weeks|Pain relief assessed by EVA scale, Global pain evaluation (EVA) will be measured at baseline, 1-, 3- and 6-month following SRT. Score is 0 (no pain) to 10 (maximal pain), 6 months|Time to first pejorative event among tumour-related complication (bone, neurological or vascular compression) and/or death, Time to first worsening event due to tumor progression (as seen on thoraco-abdomino-pelvic CT scan): including bone displacement, spinal cord or neurological compression, and vasculo-lymphatic compression will be assessed., 2 years|Number of deceased patients, Overall survival is defined as the time interval between the date of registration and the date of death irrespective of the cause, 2 years
To assess the functioning bone marrow reserve at baseline and after SRT, Functioning bone marrow reserve is quantified on 99Tc-sulfur colloid SPECT-CT by automatic delineation at baseline and at 3 months after SRT (GTV_Total/functioning BMR), Baseline and 3 months after start of SRT|To compare the anatomical and functioning assessment of the bone marrow reserve, Comparison of the tumor volume-to-bone marrow reserve ratio: GTV_total/functioning BMR and GTV_Total/anatomic BMR, Baseline and 3 months after start of SRT
