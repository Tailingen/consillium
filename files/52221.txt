DNA Analysis of Tumor Tissue Samples From Patients With Diffuse Brain Stem Glioma
This multi-institutional study will prospectively collect tumor and constitutional tissue samples from patients with diffuse brainstem glioma and other types of brainstem gliomas either during therapy or at autopsy to perform an extensive analysis of genetic and molecular abnormalities in these tumors.

Since very little is known about the biology of diffuse brainstem glioma, the goal of this protocol is to undertake a systematic analysis of DNA abnormalities, and of RNA and protein expression in prospectively collected fresh-frozen and fixed tumor samples and correspondent normal tissue from patients affected with this tumor.

OBJECTIVES:

* Perform genome-wide analysis of DNA gains and losses and RNA expression in tumor samples and normal tissue from patients with diffuse brain stem glioma.
* Identify regions of genomic gain or loss using either array comparative genomic hybridization or single nucleotide polymorphism arrays.
* Investigate genome-wide expression patterns of RNA derived from tumor samples and normal tissue from these patients via Affymetrix gene expression profiling.
* Validate the results of the genome-wide analysis by conducting further evaluation of candidate genes or by investigating the expression of relevant gene products at the RNA and protein levels.
* Perform analysis of mutations in candidate tumor-suppressor genes and oncogenes (including whole genome sequencing studies) using direct sequence analysis of tumor DNA and confirm the tumor-specific nature of these mutations by analyzing the correspondent constitutional DNA.
* Confirm genomic gains or losses identified by means of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) performed on tissue microarray using non-neoplastic brain tissue from each patient as control when available.
* Explore protein expression patterns identified by immunohistochemistry or western blot and compare them to normal brain stem tissue.
* To obtain a follow-up (questionnaire and/or telephone interview) after autopsy with parent(s), legal guardian(s), or family members of research participants in the United States to assess aspects associated with this procedure, including potential benefits and drawbacks
