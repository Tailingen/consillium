Autologous CD19 CAR T Cells in Relapsed or Refractory B-cell Lymphoma
This is a single arm, open-label, one center, dose escalation clinical study to determine the safety and efficacy of infusion of autologous T cells expressing CD19-redirected Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CD19 CAR T) in adult patients with relapsed or refractory CD19 positive B-cell lymphoma.
