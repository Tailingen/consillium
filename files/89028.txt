Phase II Lapatinib Plus Nab-Paclitaxel As First And Second Line Therapy In her2+ MBC
This was an open-label, single-arm, multi-center, Phase II study to determine the activity of nab-paclitaxel plus lapatinib in the first and second-line setting in women with ErbB2 overexpressing metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Sixty subjects were to be enrolled in the study. Subjects were to receive nab-paclitaxel (100 mg/m2 intravenously once weekly for 3 weeks, followed by a rest week in a 4-week cycle) plus lapatinib (1000 mg once daily). Subjects were to receive treatment until disease progression or withdrawal from the study. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate overall tumor response rate of lapatinib in combination with nab-paclitaxel administered in women with ErbB2 overexpressing MBC who received no chemotherapeutic regimen in the metastatic setting. Secondary objectives included progression-free survival, overall survival, duration of response, time to response and time to progression and safety. Safety and efficacy assessments were to be performed at 8 and 12 week intervals, and at the end of treatment.

Overall Tumor Response (OR), OR was defined as the percentage of participants experiencing either a confirmed complete response (CR) or a confirmed partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria 1.0. CR is defined as the disappearance of all lesions (target and/or non-target). PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions (LD) of target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum LD, with non-target lesions not increased or absent., Start of treatment to disease progression or death or discontinuation from study or at least 28 days after last dose (up to Week 131)
Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from the start of treatment until death due to any cause. For participants who did not die, time to death was censored at the time of last contact. OS could not be analyzed because only 13 participants had died as of data cut off, and data were not mature (greater than 75% of the participants were censored for the endpoint)., Start of treatment to death (up to Week 131)|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR was defined for the subset of participants who showed a confirmed CR or PR, as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until the first documented sign of disease progression or death., First documented response (CR or PR) to disease progression or death (up to Week 131)|Time to Response (TTR), TTR was defined for the subset of participants who showed a confirmed CR or PR, as the time from the start of treatment until the first documented evidence of CR or PR (whichever status was recorded first)., Start of treatment to first documented response (CR or PR) (up to Week 131)|Time to Progression (TTP), TTP was defined as the interval between the start of treatment until the earliest date of disease progression or death due to breast cancer., Start of treatment to disease progression or death (up to Week 131)|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from the start of treatment until the earliest date of disease progression or death due to any cause, if sooner., Start of treatment to disease progression or death (up to Week 131)
