Effect of Ultrasound-guided Stellate Ganglion Block Combined With Facial Nerve and Glossopharyngeal Nerve Block on the Treatment of Sudden Deafness
Sudden deafness is a sudden, unexplained sensorineural hearing loss of ≥20 dBHL in at least two adjacent frequencies within 72 h. It may be accompanied by tinnitus, a sense of ear congestion, vertigo and other Symptoms.Stellate ganglion block increases the blood flow and blood velocity in the inner ear, keeping the body's vegetative, endocrine and immune functions normal.The branches of the facial and linguopharyngeal nerves are connected to the inner ear, and local injection can nourish the nerves and improve local circulation.
Sudden Deafness
PROCEDURE: Stellate ganglion block|PROCEDURE: Facial and glossopharyngeal nerve blocks|DRUG: Mecobalamin Tablets
Mean Hearing Threshold (PTA), The average of hearing thresholds at six frequencies (250, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, and 8000 Hz) was recorded as the mean hearing threshold (PTA)., Baseline (Before treatment)，1 month and 2 months after treatment
