3'-Deoxy-3'-[18F] Fluorothymidine PET Imaging in Patients With Cancer
RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as 3'-deoxy-3'-\[18F\] fluorothymidine (FLT) PET imaging, may help find and diagnose cancer. It may also help doctors predict a patient's response to treatment and help plan the best treatment.

PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying FLT PET imaging in patients with cancer.

DEVICE: 3'-deoxy-3'-[18F]fluorothymidine
Measurement of the uptake and retention of 3'-deoxy-3'-[18F] fluorothymidine (FLT) in tumors and normal organs, at time of PET or CT PET Scan|Changes in thymidine kinase, thymidylate synthase, and standardized uptake values, before and after therapy
FLT PET response rate, up to 2 hours during PET scan
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Evaluate the use of 3'-deoxy-3'-\[18F\] fluorothymidine (FLT) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to measure tumor proliferation and the DNA synthetic pathway (thymidine kinase levels) in patients with cancer.

Secondary

* Determine the efficacy of FLT PET imaging in detecting lesions and estimating response to treatment.

OUTLINE: Patients undergo up to four 3'-deoxy-3'-\[18F\] fluorothymidine positron emission tomography imaging procedures.
