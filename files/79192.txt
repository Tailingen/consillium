Correlative Study on Cancer Patients and Healthcare Professionals Exposed to Infection by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Corona Virus-2 (SARS-Cov-2), COVID-19 Causative Agent.
Translational, prospective / retrospective, non-profit, non-pharmacological study, with cohort characteristics.

The study consists of two parts: the first to study epidemiological aspects of the spread of the disease and the second one to identify infection-related genetic factors.
COVID-19|SARS-CoV-2
OTHER: serological test|OTHER: Rapid molecular test|GENETIC: Next generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis|OTHER: serum chemistry analysis
epidemiology, Investigate the epidemiology of the infection in an asymptomatic population including both healthy individuals at high risk of infection and oncological patients by assessing the seroprevalence of IgG and IgM antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2, 12 months
Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and Immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies evaluation, IgG and IgM antibodies evaluation over time, 12 months|methods comparison, Make a comparison between different serological investigation methods and rapid molecular methods becoming available, 24 months|correlation between biochemical and coagulative factors with SARS-CoV-2 positivity., To evaluate correlation between biochemical and coagulative factors with SARS-CoV-2 positivity, 24 months|phylogenetic map, Building a phylogenetic map of an epidemic Italian macro-region, 24 months|interactions between the virus and host cells, Evaluate the spectrum of possible interactions between the virus and host cells, considering their genetic variability / instability in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 24 months
The outbreak of COVID-19 infections is spreading in Italy with unprecedented severity characteristics. In this context, it is essential to collect data relating to the epidemiology of the disease, to outline further useful tools for diagnosis and to define the correct use of rapid molecular and / or serological tests in the surveillance of high-risk subjects (cancer patients and healthcare operators), in order to identify any new disease control strategies, crucial to reduce the transmission and to outline specific guidelines for cancer patients healthcare management. It is also necessary to identify the factors that determine the evolution of the viral genome over time in the various geographical areas and also the potential susceptibility markers in the different types of affected subjects (symptomatic, mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic).
