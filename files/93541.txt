Precoce Medical Care by the Mobil Support for Patients With Glioblastoma
Most patients with glioblastoma have impaired cognitive function, autonomy, and quality of life.

This clinical situation, combined with a limited life expectancy, makes the preservation of quality of life a major objective, in a supportive environment that respects family integration. This is especially true since there is an established relationship between health-related quality of life, as measured by questionnaires.

In this context, and despite the lack of impact on overall survival, improving quality of life becomes a priority objective in recent Phase III trials.

The feasibility of introducing early accompaniment in GBM should be assessed in the diagnostic and therapeutic announcement environment. In order to measure the expected impact as favorable in the patient and his family, a broad survey of the classic domains of quality of life and more specifically dedicated to neurological symptomatology.

glioblastomas are the most common primary malignant tumours of the central nervous system.They represent about 2000 new cases per year in France.

Despite active treatments including surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, patient survival is limited without possible cure.

Most patients with glioblastoma have impaired cognitive function, autonomy, and quality of life. Exploration of verbal memory in these patients shows that its deterioration is correlated with a more unfavourable prognosis, after adjustment with other usual prognostic factors.

This clinical situation, combined with a limited life expectancy, makes the preservation of quality of life a major objective, in a supportive environment that respects family integration. This is especially true since there is an established relationship between health-related quality of life, as measured by questionnaires.
