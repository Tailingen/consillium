CRTE7A2-01 TCR-T Cells for HPV-16 Positive Advanced Cancers
A single center, open, single arm dose escalation and dose expansion phase I study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of CRTE7A2-01 TCR-T cells in HLA-A\*02:01+ Subjects HPV16 positive advanced cervical, anal, or head and neck cancers. The study will determine RP2D of CRTE7A2-01 TCR-T cell injection.
