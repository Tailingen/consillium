Clinical Evaluation of the Scopio Cell Morphology Technology
Digital morphology is currently expanding and developing new applications based on artificial intelligence software. We recently published a study comparing screen validation and microscopic reading of bone marrow aspirates. The aim of the current research will be the comparison between optical microscope reading and automatic pre-classification (AI based)
