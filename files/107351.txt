Study Of Lapatinib In Patients With Relapsed Or Refractory Inflammatory Breast Cancer
This study was designed to determine how effective and safe a new investigational drug, lapatinib, is in treating patients with treatment refractory or relapsed inflammatory breast cancer. Tumor tissue collected pre-treatment and at Day 28 will be examined for biologic activity by IHC (immunohistochemistry). Treatment will consist of daily oral therapy with lapatinib. A patient may continue treatment as long as they are receiving benefit. Blood samples for hematology and chemistry panels, MUGA/ECHO (multigated acquisition/echocardiogram) exams and physical exams will be performed throughout the study to monitor safety.

This Phase II open label, multicenter study is designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacodynamic effects of oral lapatinib administered as a single agent therapy to patients with relapsed or refractory inflammatory breast cancer. Eligible patients must have a diagnosis of inflammatory breast cancer based on clinicopathologic criteria, tumor that is readily accessible for biopsy, and must have previously received treatment with an anthracycline and taxane-containing regimen (30 patients) plus trastuzumab (90 patients). Patients enrolled must have tumors that overexpress ErbB2, with or without co-expression of ErbB1. The primary objective for this study is to evaluate the objective response rate (defined as complete response plus partial response). Secondary objectives are to evaluate clinical benefit including quality of life parameters, progression-free survival, overall survival, time-to-response, response duration, safety and tolerability, pharmacodynamic effects on intracellular mediators that regulate tumor cell growth and survival, as well as effects on proteomic profile, and circulating levels of extracellular domains of ErbB1 and ErbB2 in peripheral blood.
