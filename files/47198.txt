This is a phase 1 study of TAS-114 in combination with S-1 in patients with advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: TAS-114 + S-1
Maximum tolerated dose of TAS-114 when used in combination with S-1, 4 years
Pharmacokinetic profiles (peak plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) of TAS-114, S-1 components and its metabolite), 4 years|Response rate, 4 years|Disease control rate, 4 years|Progression free survival, 4 years
This is a phase 1, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalating safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic study of TAS-114 in combination with S-1 in patients with advanced solid tumors.
