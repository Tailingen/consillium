Short Term Aspirin on the Biologic and Immunologic Changes of the Fallopian Tube
This study will evaluate the impact of low dose aspirin on normal fallopian tube fimbriae in women who have surgery to have their fallopian tubes removed. Participants will take a low dose of aspirin for 2 weeks before their surgery. A portion of the removed fallopian tubes will also be collected for future research and routine pathology purposes.
Fallopian Tube Cancer|Fallopian Tube Infection
DRUG: Aspirin 81 mg
Number of subjects who exhibited alterations in the fallopian tube immune microenvironment, Immuno-cellular assays and percentages of specific immune cells will be compared to control tissue samples., 5 years|Number of subjects who exhibited less carcinogenic potential than control specimens, Ciliate cells from specimens will be isolated and the number of colony forming units will be compared to control samples., 5 years|Number of subjects who exhibited changes in transcriptome profile compared to control specimens, Normal fallopian tube fibria will be compared to ovarian cancer specimens to identify novel biomarkers for diagnosis, targets for prevention and better treatment strategies., 5 years
Subjects in this study will receive low dose aspirin for 14 days before undergoing surgery to remove fallopian tubes removed to determine whether aspirin decreases inflammation in the fallopian tube. Subjects will also submit blood samples at their initial visit with their oncologist, at the time of surgery and at the pre-operative visit to measure inflammation markers and blood counts. A portion of the subject's fallopian tube will be collected for future research studies.
