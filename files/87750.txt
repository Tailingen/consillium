Targeted Intra-Operative Radiotherapy for the Management of Ductal Carcinoma In-Situ of the Breast
We hypothesize that the combination of mammography and CE-MRI will improve the surgeon and radiologist's ability to define extent of disease prior to surgical resection, improve the odds of obtaining clear surgical margins, and increase the efficacy of IORT delivered immediately after initial surgical resection. In this investigation, we will determine whether or not patients deemed eligible for 'immediate" IORT based on mammography and CE-MRI can be successfully treated without the need for re-excision or additional radiotherapy due to inadequate surgical margins.
Breast Cancer
RADIATION: Intraoperative radiotherapy|DEVICE: Intraoperative radiotherapy
Feasibility. The primary efficacy endpoint will be reoperation (re-excision or mastectomy) rates following WLE or IORT, 30 days
Safety endpoints: The overall serious adverse event rate will be assessed for all patients at stated follow-up periods. Complications associated with each of the following setting will be documented and reported separately, 2 years
