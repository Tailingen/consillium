Apatinib Combined With Chemotherapy in the Treatment of Soft Tissue Sarcoma
To observe the efficacy of apatinib combined with AI regimen chemotherapy compared with AI regimen chemotherapy and single-agent apatinib in patients with unresectable soft tissue sarcoma. The main observations were progression-free survival (PFS) and progression-free control rate (PFR), followed by objective response rates (ORR, CR+PR), disease control rate (DCR, CR+PR+SD), and overall survival ( OS).

Soft Tissue Sarcoma
DRUG: Apatinib Mesylate, Pirarubicin, Ifosfamide|DRUG: Apatinib Mesylate|DRUG: Pirarubicin, Ifosfamide
Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the length of time from random assignment to disease progression or to death resulting from any cause other than the progress., Within 2 years
Disease control rate(DCR）, Investigators will assess treatment response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1（RECIST1.1）, Within 2 years|Objective tumor response rate(ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of subjects having achieved confirmed Complete Response + Partial Response as best overall response according to radiological assessments., Within 2 years|Overall survival(OS), OS is defined as the length of time from random assignment to death or to last contact., Within 3 years
