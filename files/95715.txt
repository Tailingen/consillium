Preliminary Experimental Study on Key Technologies for Early Screening of Gastric Cancer
This project aims to collect peripheral blood samples from newly diagnosed gastric cancer patients and healthy individuals. Various techniques such as cfDNA sequencing, proteomics, and fragmentomics will be employed to analyze differences in the expression of ctDNA mutations, fragmentomics, and protein biomarkers between gastric cancer patients and healthy individuals. A new comprehensive diagnostic model will be established and its diagnostic value (sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, etc.) for gastric cancer will be validated.

Specifically, the study will involve the following subjects and quantities: 700 participants from Zhejiang Cancer Hospital (350 gastric cancer patients and 350 healthy individuals), 200 participants from Sichuan Cancer Hospital (100 gastric cancer patients and 100 healthy individuals), and 200 participants from the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University (100 gastric cancer patients and 100 healthy individuals). Peripheral blood samples (a total of 15mL from each participant, collected in 3 tubes) will be collected from all subjects. The collected blood samples will undergo multi-omics sequencing including cfDNA methylation sequencing, proteomics, and genomics to establish a multi-omics-based early diagnostic model.

Differences in ctDNA gene and tumor-specific proteins expression, Collect 15ml of peripheral blood from subjects, extract ctDNA, and detect mutations in 18 genes (AKT1, APC, BRAF, CDKN2A, CTNNB1, EGFR, FBXW7, FGFR2, GNAS, HRAS, KRAS, NRAS, PIK3CA, PPP2R1A, PTEN, TP53, TOP2A, RNF43) and the expression levels of 9 tumor-specific proteins (CA-125, CA 19-9, CEA, HGF, IL-6, OPN, Prolactin, AFP, HE4) using the FireflyTM method based on amplicon library deep sequencing. Determine the performance indicators including sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the existing AccuScreen system and diagnostic model for early screening of gastric cancer. By conducting tests on 10 samples, explore the genomic fragments of gastric cancer, establish targets for ctDNA fragmentomics (fragment length, cleavage sites, end preferences, etc.), and analysis algorithms for gastric cancer fragmentomics, to further evaluate the feasibility of enhancing sensitivity and specificity for early gastric cancer screening through ctDNA fragmentomics detection., First day in hospital
