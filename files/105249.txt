A Study of LY3023414 in Participants With Advanced Cancer
The purpose of this study is to find a recommended dose level and schedule of dosing LY3023414 that can safely be taken by participants with advanced or metastatic cancer. The study will also explore the changes to various markers in blood cells and potentially tumor cells. Finally, the study will help document any antitumor activity this drug may have.

In Part A of this study, participants with advanced/metastatic cancer (including lymphoma) will receive increasing doses of LY3023414. In Part B, LY3023414 will be explored in different types of cancer, including breast and lung cancer, lymphoma and mesothelioma.
