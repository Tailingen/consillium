A Study to Learn About How Different Amounts of the Study Medicine PF-07826390 Act in the Body of People With Cancer When Taken Alone or With Other Anti-cancer Medicines.
The purpose of this study is to learn about the:

* safety (the effect of the study medicine on the participant's body),
* effects of the study medicine alone or in combination with sasanlimab -
* the best amount of the study medicine.

This study is seeking participants who have solid tumors (An abnormal mass of tissue) that:

* have advanced (cancer that does not disappear or stay away with treatment) or
* are metastatic (has spread to other parts of the body).

This includes (but limited to) the following cancer types:

* Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC): It's a type of lung cancer where the cells grow slowly but often spread to other parts of the body.
* Colorectal Cancer (CRC): This is a disease where cells in the colon or rectum grow out of control.
* Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC): This is a cancer that starts in the kidney.

All participants in this study will receive the study medication (PF-07826390) as an IV infusion (given directly into a vein) at the study once every four weeks in 28 day cycles.

The study participants depending on the group enrolled in, will receive the study medication (PF-07826390 alone or in combination with other anti-cancer medications (sasanlimab). Sasanlimab is given as a shot under the skin every 4 weeks.

Participants can continue to take the study medication (PF-07826390) until their cancer is no longer responding. Participants who are taking sasanlimab may receive it for up to 2 years.

The study will look at the experiences of people receiving the study medicines. This will help see if the study medicines are safe and effective.

Participants will be involved in this study for up to 4 years. During this time, participants will have a study visit every week. The participants after stopping the study medicine (at about 2 years) will be followed for another two years to see how the participants are doing.
