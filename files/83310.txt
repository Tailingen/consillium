Clinical and Therapeutic Impact of Large Genomic Studies at Diagnosis in Pediatric Solid Cancers
Pediatric solid tumors with an unfavorable prognosis remain a public health issue due to their morbidity and mortality and their rapidly evolving profile. They are defined by an expected overall survival of \< 30%. Progress has been made in genomic medicine with existing recommendations for the adult population, with the objective of personalized medicine. Recommendations for the pediatric population are still under consideration
