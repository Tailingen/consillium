A Phase 3 Trial of E7777 in Combination With CHOP Compared With CHOP Alone for the First-Line Treatment of Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether treatment of E7777 in combination with CHOP has superior efficacy compared with CHOP alone in improving complete response rate (CRR) in first line treatment of subjects with Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma (PTCL).
Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: E7777
To evaluate whether treatment of E7777 in combination with CHOP chemotherapy has superior efficacy compared with CHOP alone in improving progression-free survival (PFS) in first line treatment of subjects with peripheral T-cell lymphoma, * Pretreatment or pre-randomization (screening and baseline): 4 weeks.
* Treatment: 18 weeks.
* Follow up: 2 to 3 years after the end of study treatment. Treatment will stop upon disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or death, whichever occurs first. The Investigator or subject may also stop study treatment at any time for safety or personal reasons; however subject should remain on study, if possible, for follow-up., pre-randomization 4 weeks until disease progression
To evaluate whether E7777 in combination with CHOP treatment has superior efficacy compared with CHOP treatment alone as assessed by overall survival (OS) and by transplant rate.Â· To compare safety of E7777 in combination with CHOP, * Pretreatment or pre-randomization (screening and baseline): 4 weeks.
* Treatment: 18 weeks.
* Follow up: 2 to 3 years after the end of study treatment. Treatment will stop upon disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or death, whichever occurs first.
