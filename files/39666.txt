A Controlled Study of the Effectiveness of Oregovomab (Antibody) Plus Chemotherapy in Advanced Ovarian Cancer
This is a Phase 2 randomized study with two treatment arms to compare the effectiveness of oregovomab (a murine monoclonal antibody directed against cancer antigen 125 (CA125)) when combined with first-line chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel) to first-line chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel alone) in female patients with advanced ovarian cancer.

Oregovomab is an investigational drug previously used in clinical trials as an immunotherapeutic treatment of ovarian cancer patients whose tumor cells express the tumor associated antigen, CA125. The active component of oregovomab is the activated murine monoclonal antibody B43.13, an immunoglobulin G1k (IgG1k) subclass immunoglobulin that binds with high affinity (1.16E10/M) to CA125.

CA125 is a surface glycoprotein antigen that is expressed on more than 80% of all non-mucinous epithelial ovarian carcinomas where it occurs at elevated levels in the serum of patients with ovarian cancer. Little is known about its biological function. CA125 is associated with a large molecular weight mucin-like glycoprotein complex of 200-250 kilodaltons (kDa) and its genetic structure has recently been elucidated. There is good evidence to suggest that CA125 is a relevant target antigen for antigen-mediated immunotherapy of ovarian cancer.

The study will compare the effectiveness of oregovomab (a murine monoclonal antibody directed against cancer antigen 125 (CA125)) when combined with first-line chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel) to first-line chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel alone) in female patients with advanced ovarian cancer.
