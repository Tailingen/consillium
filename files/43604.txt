MLN1117 in Combination With Docetaxel, Paclitaxel, and Other Investigational Anticancer Agents to Treat Participants With Gastric and Gastroesophageal Adenocarcinoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended Part 2 dose, safety and efficacy of MLN1117 (TAK-117) in combination with docetaxel, paclitaxel, investigational TAK-659 or investigational alisertib in adult participants with advanced and metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma. The study consists of a dose escalation phase (Part 1) and a dose expansion phase (Part 2).

DLT defined as any of following considered related to any of treatment by investigator: Grade 4 neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count \<500 cells/mm\^3) for \>7 days; ≥ Grade 3 neutropenia with coincident fever or infection; Grade 4 thrombocytopenia for \>7 days; Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with clinically significant bleeding; Platelet count \<10,000/mm\^3 at any time; Delay in initiation of subsequent therapy cycle by \>7 days due to treatment-related toxicity; ≥Grade 3 nonhematological toxicity except Grade 3 arthralgia/myalgia, fatigue that lasts \<1 month, diarrhea, fasting hyperglycemia lasting ≤14 days, rash lasting ≤7 days and any other Grade 3 nonhematological toxicity that could be safely, reliably controlled to ≤Grade 1 with appropriate treatment; ≥ Grade 2 nonhematologic toxicities that are considered by investigator to be related to study drugs and dose-limiting., Up to Cycle 1 (28 days for MLN1117+TAK-659, MLN1117+Alisertib, MLN1117+Paclitaxel or 21 days for MLN1117+Docetaxel)|Number of Participants With at Least 1 Treatment-Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE) in Part 1, An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) A serious is any experience that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect or precaution that: results in death, is life-threatening, required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is medically significant. A TEAE is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug., From first dose of study drug through 30 days after the last dose of study drug (approximately up to 366 days)|Number of Participants With at Least 1 ≥ Grade 3 TEAE in Part 1, An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. TEAE is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug. There are 5 grades of the CTCAE; "grade" refers to severity. Grade 5 is the most severe, grade 1 is the least severe. As per version 4.0 of the CTCAE, Grade 3 = AE with severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-care activities of daily living. Grade 4 = AE with life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated and Grade 5 = Death related to AE., From first dose of study drug through 30 days after the last dose of study drug (approximately up to 366 days)|Number of Participants With at Least 1 Treatment-Emergent Serious Adverse Event (SAE) in Part 1, An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. A SAE is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly/birth defect; or a medically important event. TEAE is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug., From first dose of study drug through 30 days after the last dose of study drug (approximately up to 366 days)|Number of Participants With at Least 1 Dose Modification Due to AE in Part 1, A decision regarding which study drug requires dose modification is dependent upon the toxicity, its onset, and time course. The causal relationship of each AE should will be assessed in relation to MLN1117 and to the combination agent in each cohort so that dose modifications can be made accordingly. Intrapatient dose reductions of MLN1117 are not permitted during Part 1 Cycle 1 unless the participant experiences a DLT attributed to MLN1117. Per dose modification guidelines, participants who have the study drug held because of treatment related or possibly related AEs may resume study drug treatment after resolution of the AE but may either maintain the same dose level or have doses of study drug reduced (dose reduction) by at least 1 dose level and if needed, by 2 dose levels. When a dose reduction of MLN1117 occurs, the MLN1117 dose will be reduced to the next lower dose that has been established as a safe dose during dose escalation (Part 1)., From first dose of study drug through 30 days after the last dose of study drug (approximately up to 366 days)|Overall Response Rate in Part 2, Overall response is defined as complete response (CR) plus partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 criteria.

The drug being tested in this study is called MLN1117. MLN1117 is being tested to treat people who have locally advanced or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. This study will look at the dose-limiting toxicity and response to treatment in participants who take MLN1117 in combination with TAK-659, alisertib, paclitaxel, or docetaxel.

The study will enroll 32 participants in the dose escalation phase (Part 1) and 118 participants in the dose expansion phase (Part 2). Participants will be assigned to 1 of the 7 treatment groups:

* MLN1117 300 mg+Alisertib
* MLN1117 600 mg+Alisertib
* MLN1117 300 mg+Paclitaxel
* MLN1117 600 mg+Paclitaxel
* MLN1117 300 mg+TAK-659
* MLN1117 200 mg+Docetaxel
* MLN1117 300 mg+Docetaxel

In Part 1, the dose of MLN1117 will be increased step by step. All participants will be asked to take tablets of MLN1117 for 3 days on and 4 days off per week in 28-day treatment cycles or 21-day treatment cycles when given in combination with the other companion drugs.

This multi-center trial will be conducted in Spain and United States. The overall time to participate in this study is 10 months for Part 1 and 24 months for Part 2. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and be contacted by telephone, e-mail or mail every 12 weeks for up to 6 months or 1 year after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
