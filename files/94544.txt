Rating Description

1. Very Much Improved- Optimal cosmetic result in this subject
2. Much Improved- Marked improvement in appearance form the initial condition, but not completely optimal for this subject.
3. Improved- Obvious improvement in appearance from initial condition, but a re- treatment is indicated.
4. No Change- The appearance is essentially the same as the original condition.
5. Worse- The appearance is worse than the original condition.

The primary objective of this pilot study is to assess efficacy and safety of intense pulsed light (IPL; StellarM22â„¢ Universal IPL, Lumenis Ltd., Yokneam, Israel) alone versus combination of IPL activation of silver nanoparticles (SNA) for treatment of keratosis pilaris.

Prior to first treatment, right and left arms of 10 enrolled subjects will be randomized to combination treatment with IPL activation of SNA (i.e. intervention arm) versus IPL alone (i.e. control arm). The intervention arm will be pre-treated with sugaring to epilate existing hair. This arm will then be treated with 0.5mL of nanoparticle suspension administered with a standard infusion paddle for 5 minutes prior to IPL treatment.

Following nanoparticle infusion, excess suspension will be removed from the surface of the skin with a pre-moistened wipe. Once all visible suspension is removed from the skin, the area will be cleansed with an alcohol wipe. If the alcohol wipe shows that the suspension is still present on the surface of the skin, additional pre-moistened wipes will be used to cleanse the skin until the alcohol wipe comes away without visible suspension. IPL will then be applied to the intervention arm.

Treatments will be repeated three times, spaced four- to six-weeks apart. After completing all three treatments, patients will return for macroscopic and dermoscopic photography at 1 month and 3 months.
