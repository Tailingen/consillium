A Study of Enfortumab Vedotin in Japanese Subjects With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma
The objective of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of enfortumab vedotin (ASG-22CE) when administered intravenously to Japanese subjects with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma. This study will also assess the immunogenicity as defined by the incidence of anti-drug antibody (ADA) and anti-tumor activity of enfortumab vedotin (ASG-22CE) when administered intravenously to Japanese subjects with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma.
