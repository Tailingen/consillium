RAGE Inhibition to Decrease Cardiotoxicity in Women With Early Breast Cancer
This is a pilot study to evaluate the effects of azeliragon to decrease cardiac toxicity from chemotherapy and the safety of azelirgaon when given with chemotherapy. The Investigators hypothesize that there will be no significant interaction with Azeliragon and chemotherapy and that targeting the RAGE pathway will decrease anthracycline related cardiotoxicity and chemotherapy related cognitive decline.
