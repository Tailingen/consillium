Prostate Cancer Risk in Firefighters
Firefighters have been shown to be at increased risk for various types of cancer, including prostate cancer. This study will try to explore possible reasons for this increase in risk. A study group at the Cancer Registry of Norway is creating a cohort of Norwegian firemen employed from 1960 onwards. A job exposure matrix (JEM) is also being constructed, examining different types of exposure to potentially cancer-inducing agents and activities, and how these have changed historically. Examples include exposure to fire-smoke, shiftwork, diesel exhaust and regular health check-ups. By linking the cohort with data from the Cancer Registry of Norway and the JEM the investigators can examine which exposure assessments, if any, are related to an increased risk of prostate cancer.
