Efficacy and Safety Study of EG12014 Compared With Herceptin in Subjects With HER2 Positive Early Breast Cancer
The purpose of this research study is to compare the efficacy and safety of EG12014 with Herceptin as neoadjuvant treatment for 12 weeks, followed by surgery and subsequent EG12014 or Herceptin adjuvant treatment for up to 12 months.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: EG12014|DRUG: Herceptin
Determination of pathologic complete response (pCR) at time of surgery, pCR is defined as the absence of residual invasive cancer on hematoxylin and eosin evaluation of the complete resected breast specimen and all sampled sentinel and/or axillary lymph nodes, At the time of surgery (3-6 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy)
pCR at the time of surgery, pCR is defined as the absence of residual invasive cancer and of DICS (ypT0 ypN0) from breast tissue and sentinel/axillary lymph nodes, as assessed by central laboratory, At the time of surgery (3-6 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy)|pCR at the time of surgery, pCR is defined as the absence of invasive cancer in breast tissue only (ypT0/is) as assessed by central laboratory, At the time of surgery (3-6 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy)|Event-free survival (EFS) up to end of study (EOS), EFS is defined as time from initial randomization to the date when disease recurrence or progression (local, regional, distant or contralateral) is diagnosed according to institutional standard, or date of death of any cause, whichever is earlier, Randomization to date of progression or end of study (up to approximately 24 months or death)|Overall response (OR) prior to surgery, Objective response is defined as partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) according to RECIST v1.1, At screening and prior to surgery (3-6 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy)|Overall survival (OS) up to End of Study (EOS), OS up to EOS is defined as time from the date of initial randomization to the date of death, Randomization to end of study (up to approximately 24 months or death)|Incidence of AEs, Incidence of AEs (including severity, seriousness, and relationship to study drug) and laboratory abnormalities, From time of informed consent to end of study (up to approximately 25 months or death)|Evaluation of Immunogenicity of EG12014 and Herceptin, Titer of anti-drug antibodies (ADA), Prior to 1st infusion of study drug, during neoadjuvant treatment, after the last dose of neoadjuvant treatment, during adjuvant treatment, and End of Treatment|Measure serum trastuzumab concentration, Measure serum trastuzumab concentration for EG12014 and Herceptin arms, Prior to 1st infusion of study drug, during neoadjuvant treatment after the last dose of neoadjuvant treatment, during adjuvant treatment, and End of Treatment
