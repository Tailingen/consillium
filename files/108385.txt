A Study of AL2846 Capsule Versus Placebo in the Treatment of Advanced Radioiodine-Refractory Differentiated Thyroid Carcinoma
This study aims to demonstrate that, in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic iodine - refractory differentiated thyroid cancer who have failed previous VEGFR - targeted therapy, AL2846 can significantly prolong progression - free survival (PFS) compared with placebo.
Thyroid Cancer
DRUG: AL2846 Capsules|DRUG: AL2846 Placebo
Progression - Free Survival (PFS) evaluated by the Independent Review Committee (IRC), Defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of disease progression determined by IRC or death, whichever occurred firstly., 34 months
Overall Survival (OS), Defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death for any reason., 34 months|Compare the Progression - Free Survival (PFS) evaluated by the researchers in the treatment group and the placebo group, PFS: The time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause (whichever occurs first), as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1., 34 months|Compare the objective response rate (ORR) between the treatment group and the placebo group, Objective Response Rate (ORR): It is defined as the percentage of subjects with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as determined by the Independent Review Committee (IRC)/investigator according to RECIST 1.1., 34 months|Compare the Disease Control Rate (DCR) between the treatment group and the placebo group, Disease Control Rate (DCR): It is defined as the percentage of subjects with complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) as determined by the Independent Review Committee (IRC)/investigator according to RECIST 1.1., 34 months|Compare the Duration of Response (DOR) between the treatment group and the placebo group, Duration of Response (DOR): It is defined as the time from the first documented and confirmed objective response to disease progression or death from any cause (whichever occurs first), as determined by the IRC/investigator according to RECIST v1.1., 34 months|Evaluate the safety of AL2846 capsules compared with placebo in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic iodine - refractory differentiated thyroid cancer who have failed previous VEGFR - targeted therapy, The incidence and severity of adverse events, with severity determined according to the NCI CTCAE v5.0 grading scale., 34 months
