Assessment of Hypoxia Before Radioembolization Treatment With 18F-FMISO PET
Hypoxia is a known factor for resistance to radiotherapy in tumors. Response to transarterial radioembolization is known to be variable between different patients even if the same dose of radiation was delivered. In this study the investigators aim to quantify the hypoxia in the primary and secondary tumors of liver with 18F-FMISO PET before radioembolization and to prove any effect of the hypoxia, if present, on the dose that should be delivered to tumor to ensure treatment response.
