APBI Versus EBRT Therapy After Breast Conserving Surgery for Low-risk Breast Cancer
To assess the role of interstitial brachytherapy alone compared to whole breast irradiation in a defined low-risk group of invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ concerning local failure (all ipsilateral local recurrences) to affirm the hypothesis that local control rates in each arm are equivalent.
