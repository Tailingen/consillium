Study of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) Versus Investigator's Choice of Chemotherapy for Participants With Advanced Esophageal/Esophagogastric Junction Carcinoma That Progressed After First-Line Therapy (MK-3475-181/KEYNOTE-181)-China Extension Study
In the China extension study, Chinese participants with advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus or Siewert type I adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction (EGJ) that has progressed after first-line standard therapy will be randomized to receive either single agent pembrolizumab or the Investigator's choice of chemotherapy with paclitaxel, docetaxel, or irinotecan.

The primary extension study hypothesis is that treatment with pembrolizumab will prolong overall survival (OS) as compared to treatment with chemotherapy.

Median OS for the first pembrolizumab course in participants with a PD-L1 CPS ≥10 is presented., From randomization through final analysis data cutoff date of 13-Feb-2019 (Up to ~24 months)|Overall Survival (OS) in Participants With Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) of the Esophagus, OS was defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. Median OS for the first pembrolizumab course in participants with SCC of the esophagus is presented., From randomization through final analysis data cutoff date of 13-Feb-2019 (Up to ~24 months)
Objective Response Rate (ORR) as Assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) in All Participants, ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who had a Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: ≥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) as assessed using RECIST 1.1 by central imaging vendor review. The percentage of all participants who experienced a CR or PR for the first pembrolizumab course is presented., From randomization through final analysis data cutoff date of 13-Feb-2019 (Up to ~24 months)|Objective Response Rate (ORR) as Assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) in Participants With Programmed Death-Ligand 1 Combined Positive Score ≥10 (PD-L1 CPS ≥10), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who had a Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: ≥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) as assessed using RECIST 1.1 by central imaging vendor review.

Per RECIST 1.1, PD was defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also have demonstrated an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of ≥1 new lesions was also considered PD. Median PFS for the first pembrolizumab course as assessed by central imaging vendor review per RECIST 1.1 in all participants is presented., From randomization through final analysis data cutoff date of 13-Feb-2019 (Up to ~24 months)|Progression-free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) in Participants With Programmed Death-Ligand 1 Combined Positive Score ≥10 (PD-L1 CPS ≥10), PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first.

The number of participants who experienced ≥1 AE for the first pembrolizumab course are presented., From randomization through final analysis data cutoff date of 13-Feb-2019 (Up to ~24 months)|Number of Participants Discontinuing Study Treatment Due an Adverse Event (AE), An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a study treatment and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.

The China extension study will include participants previously enrolled in China in the global study for MK-3475-181 (NCT02564263) plus those enrolled during the China extension enrollment period.

Per protocol, response/progression or adverse events during the second pembrolizumab course will not be counted towards efficacy outcome measures or safety outcome measures.
