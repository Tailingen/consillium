BESPOKE Study of ctDNA Guided Therapy in Colorectal Cancer
The BESPOKE CRC study will prospectively enroll patients who have undergone surgery for stage I to IV colorectal cancer (CRC) and who have residual formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue available will provide FFPE and whole blood samples. Patients will receive SIGNATERA™ test results and may be recommended for post-operative systemic therapy or observation by their treating clinician. Patients will be followed for up to two years with periodic whole blood collection. The study also has a control arm that will consist of matched Stage I to IV CRC cases that have a minimum of least 2 years clinical follow-up data.

Examine the impact of SIGNATERA™ on adjuvant treatment decisions, The study will examine the percent of patients who have their adjuvant treatment regimen increased or decreased after the treating physician evaluates the results from the post-surgical SIGNATERA™ ctDNA test for patients with Stage II and Stage III CRC., 1 years|Determine the rate of recurrence of patients diagnosed with CRC while asymptomatic using SIGNATERA™, The study will examine the Proportion of positive SIGNATERA™ results at any timepoint during surveillance; prior to being identified by other methods whilst undergoing recurrence monitoring for patients with Stage I to IV CRC, 2 years
Evaluate Molecular residual disease clearance as assessed by SIGNATERA™, The proportion of patients with a positive SIGNATERA™ ctDNA test post-surgery that subsequently receive a negative test result during or after systemic therapy, 2 years|The study will examine the percent of patients undergoing surgery for oligometastatic recurrence, The proportion of patients that are diagnosed with oligometastatic recurrence that undergo additional surgery, 2 years|Evaluate survival in patients treated with adjuvant versus no adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with SIGNATERA™ negative test results, Proportion of patients with a negative SIGNATERA™ ctDNA test post-surgery that are still alive the end of the trial (during surveillance) treated with adjuvant versus no adjuvant chemotherapy, 2 years|Explore Overall survival, Proportion of patients with a negative SIGNATERA™ ctDNA that are still alive the end of the trial (during surveillance), 2 years|Examine the Impact of SIGNATERA™ test results on patient quality of life, Determine if SIGNATERA™ results makes patients feel less worried or anxious about the possibility of cancer recurrence. Assess if SIGNATERA™ makes patients feel that they are receiving the right treatment and determine if patients would continue to use Signatera in the future to monitor their cancer recurrence. This will be measured by asking the patients three study specific questions on a 5-point scale (1=Not all, 5= All the time) with a lower score indicating a better outcome., 2 years|Assess well being in patients receiving SIGNATERA™ ctDNA test results, Assess a patients wellbeing using the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Colorectal Symptom Index- 19 items (NCCN-FACT FCIS-19 version 2). Responses for each items are given on a 4-point scale (0=Not at all, 4 = very much) with a lower score indicating a better outcome., 2 years|Assess patient cancer anxiety levels in patients receiving SIGNATERA™ ctDNA test results, Assess Fear of Recurrence in patients receiving SIGNATERA™ ctDNA test results by using the Fear of Recurrence short form (FCR-4) using a 5-point scale (1=Not all, 5= All the time) with a lower score indicating a better outcome., 2 years|Assess patient anxiety and depression levels in patients receiving SIGNATERA™ ctDNA test results, Assess patient anxiety and depression levels in patients receiving SIGNATERA™ ctDNA test results using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-A). The HADS is a fourteen item scale. Seven of the items relate to anxiety and seven relate to depression. The anxiety and depression subscales each range from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating higher anxiety/depression complains. Patients were defined as having anxiety or depression or both if the score was 8 or more in the corresponding subscale., 2 years|Examine the number of Stage I CRC patients that have recurrent disease detected post-surgery based on SIGNATERA™ test results, Proportion of Stage I CRC cases with a positive SIGNATERA™ test and have recurrent disease detected post-surgery and receive systemic therapy., 2 years
Primary Objectives:

* Determine the rate of recurrence of patients diagnosed with CRC while asymptomatic using SIGNATERA™

Secondary objectives:

* Molecular residual disease clearance as assessed by SIGNATERA™
* Percent of patients undergoing surgery for oligometastatic recurrence
* Survival in patients treated with adjuvant versus no adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with SIGNATERA™ negative test results
* Overall survival
* Impact of SIGNATERA™ test results on patient quality of life
