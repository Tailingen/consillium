Jejunoileal vs Gastric GIST in the Era of Imatinib.
Introduction: Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors (GISTs) located in the jejunum or ileum (JI-GIST) are considered of worse prognosis compared to other locations. It has been suggested that this dogma should be revised. The aim of this study is to describe the characteristics of jejunoileal GISTs and its prognosis; and to compare them with gastric GISTs in the era of imatinib.

Patients and methods: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical histories of all the patients diagnosed with GISTs between January 2000 and November 2016. Clinical and pathological data, as well recurrence, metastatic, disease-free survival (DFS) as overall (OS) rates of patients with JI-GIST or gastric GIST (G-GIST) were collected and compared.
