Long Term Effects of Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Therapy on Ovarian Reserve and Fertility in Patients With Chronic Myeloid Leukemia or Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor
This pilot research trial studies the long term effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy on ovarian reserve and fertility in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia or gastrointestinal stromal tumor. Studying ovary imaging, ovarian reserve markers, and hormone levels from patients receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy may help doctors learn more about the effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy on ovarian function and fertility.

Changes in markers of ovarian reserve in premenopausal women undergoing tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy for cancer, Standard descriptive statistics and scatter plots will be used to summarize patterns by cohorts at each time point. Regression methods will be used to render data compatible with the assumption of the normal distribution. Analysis will be undertaken to obtain preliminary estimates of ovarian reserve over time and to elucidate whether TKI therapy produces a clinically meaningful change in ovarian reserve marker., Baseline to up to 1 year
Ovarian response to controlled ovarian hyperstimulation in patients who elect to undergo IVF for fertility preservation, The results of their stimulation protocol will be recorded., Up to 1 year
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To collect preliminary information to help design a study to look at longitudinal changes in markers of ovarian reserve and menstruation in premenopausal women undergoing tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) therapy.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Evaluate ovarian response to controlled ovarian hyperstimulation in patients who elect to undergo in vitro fertilization (IVF) for fertility preservation.

OUTLINE:

Patients undergo transvaginal ultrasound for antral follicles analysis and collection of serum for ovarian reserve markers and hormonal analysis before TKI therapy and at 12, 24, and 48 weeks.
