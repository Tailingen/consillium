Neural Correlates of Language Control in Bilinguals. Functional MRI and Stimulation Mapping Data in Awake Surgery.
For bilingual and multilingual patients, brain activation and Electric Stimulation Mapping studies have shown that different languages may be localized, at least partially, in distinct microanatomical systems located within the same gross anatomical areas.

The present investigation involves both types of healthy bilinguals with carefully controlled proficiency levels, as well as bilingual patients suffering from low-grade glioma.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging data will be collected while the participants perform a picture naming task in blocked conditions for both languages (either English or French) or in switch condition (English and French). A stimulation mapping study will be conducted in the patients during awake surgery with the same tasks.
Bilingualism
DEVICE: functional magnetic resonance imaging
Brain activity, The primary judgment criteria is brain activity as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging :

* In blocked vs. switched naming in control subjects
* In switched naming in early vs. late bilingual subjects
* In blocked vs. switched naming in early vs. late bilingual subjects, 24 hours
Brain activity, The secondary judgment criteria is brain activity measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging :

* In blocked vs. switched naming in the patients
* In French vs. English and English vs. French naming in the late bilinguals
* In French vs. English and English vs. French naming in the early bilinguals
* In French vs. LX and LX vs. French naming in the patients., 24 hours
