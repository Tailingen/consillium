Gut Microbiota And Radiotherapy
A pilot, single arm, single center study to determine the feasibility of obtaining stool samples from adult patients receiving SBRT to a lung tumor, if SBRT induces changes in the gut microbiota and to obtain preliminary data about possible correlation of baseline composition and changes in gut microbiota with tumor response, local control, and development of pneumonitis/other side effects.
