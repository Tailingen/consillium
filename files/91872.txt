This is a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, two-parts, FIH study to evaluate the tolerability, safety, PK/PD, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of NM1F as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab (KeytrudaÂ®) in subjects with unresectable locally advanced, or metastatic solid tumors.

The study consists of two parts : NM1F monotherapy dose escalation (Phase 1a), NM1F dose escalation in combination with a fixed dose of pembrolizumab (Phase 1b). For each subject in the two parts, the study will include a screening period (up to 28 days), a treatment period (1 year and 2 years for Phase 1a and 1b, respectively, or until treatment discontinuation), and a follow-up period .
