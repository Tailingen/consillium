Exercise Regimen Designed to Improve Functional Mobility, Body Composition, and Strength After Breast Conservation Therapy for Women With Early Stage Breast Cancer
The purpose of this research study is to find out if a monitored group exercise program can increase strength, muscle mass and ability to move in women after treatment for early stage breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Exercise program
Adherence, defined as the proportion of participants completing at least 75% of the planned exercise sessions, 12 weeks
This trial will assess the safety and feasibility of a monitored group exercise regimen utilizing high-load resistance training and functional exercises with compound movements in a group of women treated for early stage breast cancer with the goal of improving functional mobility, body composition, and strength after breast conservation therapy.
