INS19 CAR-T Cells for the Treatment of Relapsed or Refractory Acute B Lymphoblastic Leukemia
This study, a single-center, open, single-dose clinical study, was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profile of INS19 CAR-T cells for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory acute B lymphoblastic leukemia
Leukemia, B-cell
BIOLOGICAL: INS19 CAR-T Cells
Incidence of Treatment Related adverse events (AEs), Incidence of adverse events associated with CAR-T treatment, abnormal clinically significant laboratory findings, including dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum-tolerated Dose (MTD)., Up to 28 days after CAR-T cell infusion|Persistence of CAR-T cells, cell counts and cell percentage in peripheral blood and bone marrow, Up to 24 weeks after CAR-T cell infusion
Objective response rate (ORR), Objective response rate (ORR), At 28 days, 3 months and 6 months after CAR-T cell infusion|Relapse free survival (RFS), Relapse free survival (RFS), At 28 days, 3 months and 6 months after CAR-T cell infusion|Relapse free survival (RFS), Relapse free survival (RFS), Up to 24 months after CAR-T cell infusion|Duration of response (DOR), Duration of response (DOR), Up to 24 months after CAR-T cell infusion|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS), Up to 24 months after CAR-T cell infusion|Minimal residual disease (MRD) negative rate, Minimal residual disease (MRD) negative rate, Up to 24 months after CAR-T cell infusion|Minimal residual disease (MRD) negative duration, Minimal residual disease (MRD) negative duration, Up to 24 months after CAR-T cell infusion|Anti-therapeutic INS19 CAR-T cells antibody, Anti-therapeutic INS19 CAR-T cells antibody, Up to 24 months after CAR-T cell infusion
The study is planned to enroll 9-12 patients with relapsed or refractory acute B-lymphoblastic leukemia in a modified "3+3" design with two dose groups of 1×10\^7 cells and 2×10\^7 cells (dose halved for subjects weighing \<40 kg). Each dose group is planned to enroll 3-6 subjects to assess safety, and ultimately the SRC will decide whether to continue to add escalating dose groups or to conduct an extension study in a specific dose group based on available safety and efficacy information, with 3-6 subjects to be enrolled in the extension phase.

This study will be divided into a screening period, a cell collection period, a chemotherapy pretreatment period, a return infusion and a follow-up period, and within 28 days of return infusion the investigator will assess whether a DLT (Dose limited toxicity) event has occurred to confirm the safety of this dose group.
