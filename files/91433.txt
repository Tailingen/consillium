Radiofrequency Ablation Using Octopus Electrodes for Treatment of Focal Liver Malignancies: Follow-up Study
The purpose of this study is to compare the therapeutic outcomes and safety of the study patients who received radiofrequency ablation (RFA) using separable clustered electrodes with those of a matched historical control group who had received RFA using multiple internally-cooled electrodes.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DEVICE: Separable clustered electrodes
Cumulative 1-year local tumor progression (LTP) rate, Comparison of rates of LTP in two groups in a year after RFA, 12 months after RFA|Cumulative 2-year LTP rate, Comparison of rates of LTP in two groups in two years after RFA, 24 months after RFA|Cumulative 3-year LTP rate, Comparison of rates of LTP in two groups in three years after RFA, 36 months after RFA
1-year Recurrence free survival rate, comparison of survival rate without disease progression in two groups, 12 months after RFA|2-year Recurrence free survival rate, comparison of survival rate without disease progression in two groups, 24 months after RFA|3-year Recurrence free survival rate, comparison of survival rate without disease progression in two groups, 36 months after RFA
Major complication rate after RFA, Description and comparison of the type and incidence of major complication after RFA are assessed according to Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) grading system in two groups., 30 days after RFA|Technical success rate, comparison of rates of sufficient ablative zone creation which covers the whole tumor on post-RFA computed tomography (CT) in each group, 1 day after RFA
Although RFA is widely used as a curative treatment option for a variety of liver malignancies, it is generally limited for treating tumors larger than 2 cm in diameter with a sufficient tumor-free margin. Thus, various strategies are employed to create a sufficient ablation zone such as internally cooled-electrodes, expandable electrodes and adaptation of switching mono/bipolar controllers. Despite that these attempts have created larger ablative zones in clinical and preclinical studies, the efficacy should be validated in terms of clinical outcome.

In this study, investigators evaluated the therapeutic outcomes and safety of RFA using separable clustered electrodes for treatment-naive hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) in comparison with RFA using multiple internally-cooled electrodes. The study group is a subgroup of our prospective study cohort (NCT02683538) and a control group is a matched historical group received RFA in our institution using multiple internally-cooled electrodes.
