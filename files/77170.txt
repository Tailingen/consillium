Effect of an Oral Supplement on the Total Energy and Protein Intake of Head and Neck Cancer Patients in the Last 2 Weeks of Radiation Therapy
In this study, an oral nutrition supplement has been developed that take into consideration: the nutritional requirements, treatment side-effects and taste preferences of head and neck cancer patients; the acceptance of a supplement when experiencing radiation therapy side-effects; and the taste preferences of head and neck cancer patients which may affect the supplement intake. We hope to increase dietary intake during the last 2 weeks of radiation therapy.
