Establishing a Tumor Bank in Families With Multiple Lymphoproliferative Malignancies
The purpose of this study is to investigate possible genetic factors that contribute to the development of lymphomas. The databank will be used to determine whether familial lymphomas have unique genetic characteristics different from sporadic lymphomas and to attempt to identify a gene that confers an increased risk of lymphoma.

* Patients who participate will be asked to complete detailed family and medical history questionnaires initially, with a follow-up questionnaire every year.
* Patients will be asked to supply a blood sample and possibly a mouthwash sample, both of which can be done by mail.
* Patients will be asked to consent to the release of their lymphoma tissue block for the purposes of the study.
* Patients will be given letters of invitation for their affected relatives to invite them to participate.
