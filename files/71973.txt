99mTc-HPArk2 SPECT/CT for the Detection of HER2-positive Breast Cancer
This is an open-label single photon emission tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) study to investigate the diagnostic performance and evaluation efficacy of 99mTc-HPArk2 in breast cancer patients. A single dose of 11.1Mega-Becquerel (MBq) per kilogram body weight 99mTc-HPArk2 will be injected intravenously. Visual and semiquantitative method will be used to assess the SPECT/CT images.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: 99mTc-HPArk2
Standardized uptake value of 99mTc-HPArk2 in breast tumor, The semiquantitative analysis will be performed by the same person for all the cases, and the standardized uptake value (SUV) of the tracer in breast tumor will be measured. SUV were obtained by a self-made software and referring to phantom study., 1 year
Adverse events collection, Adverse events within 1 week after the injection and scanning of patients and patients will be followed and assessed, 1 week
99mTc-HPArk2 is an affibody probe targeting HER2. The investigators will determine the use of 99mTc-HPArk2 SPECT/CT in the detection of HER2-positive breast cancer, and to compare its diagnostic value with routine immunohistochemistry (IHC) pathological staining. HER2 imaging, specifically to HER2 receptor expressed on malignant breast cancer cell surface, might help for targeted therapy with monoclonal antibody such as trastuzumab in breast cancer, and may improve the treatment strategy of breast cancer. The investigator will determine the use of 99mTc-HPArk2 SPECT/CT in stratifying breast cancer.
