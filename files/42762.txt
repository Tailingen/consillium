Docetaxel in Breast Cancer
Primary objective :

* To compare disease-free survival after treatment with docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide to doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel in operable adjuvant breast cancer HER2neu negative patients with positive axillary lymph nodes.

Secondary objectives :

* To compare toxicity and quality of life between the 2 above-mentioned arms.
* To evaluate pathologic and molecular markers for predicting efficacy.

Local, Regional or Metastatic Relapse, or Second Primary Cancer, or Death From Any Cause (Disease-Free Survival), The primary event is the local, regional or metastatic relapse or the date of second primary cancer or death from any cause (whichever occurs first). The primary efficacy analysis is performed on the time from randomization to this primary event. The Measured Values table below presents the numbers of patients with the event at the end of the study period., Median follow-up 65 months
Death From Any Cause (Overall Survival), The considered event is death from any cause. The analysis is performed on the time from randomization to this event. The Measured Values table below presents the numbers of patients with the event at the end of the study period., Median follow-up of 65 months
