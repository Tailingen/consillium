Clinical Evaluation of Genetron TERT PCR Kit in Glioma Patients
The purpose of this trail is to evaluate the performance of Genetron TERT PCR Kit in Glioma patients using real-time PCR method.
Glioma, Malignant
Efficacy of the Genetron TERT PCR Kit, The main purpose of this study is: by evaluating the Genetron TERT PCR Kit to compare the results of the Sanger sequencing method, and to calculate the coincidence rate and consistency of the two methods., 3 months
This trial follows the principle of synchronous blinding. The enrolled cases are coded, and the enrolled samples are detected with the Genetron TERT PCR Kit and Sanger sequencing method. The results were determined independently according to the cutoff values or interpretation requirements provided by each method.Combined with the results of clinicopathological classification, the incidence of C228T and C250T mutations of TERT promoter genes in different subtypes was counted to evaluate the clinical application performance of the Genetron TERT PCR Kit.
