CL of midazolam in the presence and absence of lapatinib will be determined., Pre-dose, 2 minutes, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 24 hours post-dose on Day 1, Day 3, Day 9 and Day 11|Half-life (tÂ½) of midazolam, Blood samples will be collected at indicated time points for the determination of midazolam concentration. t1/2 of midazolam in the presence and absence of lapatinib will be determined., Pre-dose, 2 minutes, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 24 hours post-dose on Day 1, Day 3, Day 9 and Day 11|Absolute bioavailability (F) of midazolam, Blood samples will be collected at indicated time points for the determination of midazolam concentration. Absolute bioavailability of midazolam in the presence and absence of lapatinib will be determined., Pre-dose, 2 minutes, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 24 hours post-dose on Day 1, Day 3, Day 9 and Day 11
Time of maximum observed concentration (tmax) of midazolam, Blood samples will be collected at indicated time points for the determination of midazolam concentration., Pre-dose, 2 minutes, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 24 hours post-dose on Day 1, Day 3, Day 9 and Day 11|Volume of distribution (Vss) of midazolam, Blood samples will be collected at indicated time points for the determination of midazolam concentration., Pre-dose, 2 minutes, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 24 hours post-dose on Day 1, Day 3, Day 9 and Day 11|Number of subjects with adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death; is life-threatening; requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; important medical events may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above., Up to Month 7|Number of subjects with abnormal clinical chemistry parameters, The following clinical chemistry parameters were evaluated: sodium, potassium, total carbon dioxide (CO2), calcium, total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN)., Up to Month 7|Number of subjects with abnormal hematology parameters, The following hematology parameters were evaluated: hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, white blood cell count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, monocyte count, eosinophil count and basophil count., Up to Month 7|Number of subjects with abnormal blood pressure, Systolic and diastolic blood pressure will be measured., Up to Month 7|Number of subjects with abnormal heart rate, Heart rate will be measured., Up to Month 7
