Sapanisertib and Serabelisib (PIKTOR) With Paclitaxel and a Substudy With an Insulin-Suppressing Diet in Patients With Advanced/Recurrent Endometrial Cancer
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, open-label, single-arm study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sapanisertib and serabelisib (PIKTOR) with paclitaxel in participants with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer.

This is a Phase 2, multicenter, open-label, single-arm study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sapanisertib and serabelisib (PIKTOR) with paclitaxel in participants with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer who have failed prior systemic therapies, including a platinum-based therapy and an immune checkpoint inhibitor, either separately or together.
