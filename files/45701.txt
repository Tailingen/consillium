A Study of Atezolizumab and Trastuzumab in Combination With Capecitabine and Oxaliplatin in Patients With HER2 Positive Locally Advanced Resectable Gastric Cancer of Adenocarcinoma of Gastroesophageal Junction
This is a phase II, multicenter, randomized, open-label study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of perioperative trastuzumab+XELOX with / without atezolizumab in participants eligible for surgery with locally advanced HER2-positive gastric cancer or adenocarcinoma of GEJ.
Gastric Cancer|Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: Atezolizumab|DRUG: Trastuzumab|DRUG: Capecitabine|DRUG: Oxaliplatin
Pathological Complete Regression (pCR) Rate, pCR is defined as no evidence of vital residual tumor cells on hematoxylin and eosin evaluation of the complete resected gastric/GEJ specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes following completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NAST), which will be reviewed by local pathologist.., Completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy (up to approximately 16 months)
Event-free Survival (EFS), Event-free survival (EFS), defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease recurrence, unequivocal tumor progression determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Randomization to the first documented disease recurrence, unequivocal tumor progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 52 months)|Disease-Free Survival (DFS), Disease-free survival (DFS), defined as the time from surgery to the first documented disease recurrence or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Surgery to first documented disease recurrence or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 52 months)|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS), defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause in all patients., Randomiation to death from any cause (up to approximately 52 months)|Major Pathologic Response (MPR), Major pathologic response (MPR), defined as \< 10% residual tumor per tumor bed based on evaluation of the resected primary esophagogastric specimen by a local pathologist., Randomization up to approximately 16 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective response rate (ORR), defined as the proportion of patients with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) during NAST, as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1., Randomiation to CR or PR during neoadjuvant systemic therapy (up to approximately 16 months)|R0 Resection Rate, R0 resection rate, defined as the proportion of patients with a microscopically margin-negative resection, in which no gross or microscopic tumor remains in the primary tumor bed and/or sampled regional lymph nodes based on evaluation by the local pathologist., Surgery|Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events, Baseline through the end of study (approximately 52 months)
