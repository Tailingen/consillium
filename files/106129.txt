Combination Camrelizumab (SHR-1210) and Apatinib for Downstaging/Bridging of HCC Before Liver Transplant
To assess the primary effects and safety of camrelizumab (SHR-1210) plus apatinib for downstaging/bridging of HCC before liver transplantation.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma|Liver Transplant
DRUG: Camrelizumab plus apatinib
Objective remission rate, The proportion of patients with CR, PR, and SD in the group, From enrollment to disease progression, up to 6 months|Recurrence-free survival, The period from enrollment surgery to recurrence of HCC, 1 year
Overall survival, The survival rate in a year, 1 year|Time to progress, The period from enrollment to disease progression, From enrollment to disease progression, up to 6 months|Adverse effect, Any adverse effects occur during the project, 1 year
HCC patients waiting for liver transplantation will be screened and enrolled according to the inclusion criteria. After screening and enrollment, patients will be administrated camrelizumab 200mg q2w iv and apatinib 250mg qd po regimen every 4 weeks as a cycle. Each patient will receive camrelizumab treatment for at least 2 cycles and discontinue camrelizumab 5 weeks before liver transplantation. Apatinib will be discontinued 1 week before liver transplantation. Once the tumor progression was detected, the program will be terminated and the appropriate optimal treatment will be given. The objective remission rate (ORR), recurrence-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS), time to progress (TTP) and any adverse effect during the study will be evaluated in order to assess the primary effects and safety of camrelizumab (SHR-1210) plus apatinib for downstaging/bridging of HCC before liver transplantation.
