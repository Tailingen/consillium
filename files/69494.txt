Effect of Dexmedetomidine on the Inflammatory Response After One-lung Ventilation
The postoperative inflammatory response is significant in lung resection surgery because of major operation and one-lung ventilation. Dexmedetomidine has been shown to reduce pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and improve clinical outcomes. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of dexmedetomidine on inflammatory responses after lung resection surgery.
