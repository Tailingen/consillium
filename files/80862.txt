CIT is one of the most common complications of tumor treatment, which is caused by the inhibition of anticancer chemotherapy drugs on megakaryocytes in bone marrow, resulting in platelet count lower than 100×109/L in peripheral blood, and is a common hematological toxic reaction in clinic. CIT leads to an increased risk of bleeding and transfusion, and severe CIT can cause intracranial bleeding and death. The use of platelet infusion is limited and ineffective in 25% of patients. rhIL-11 increases the incidence of cardiovascular events and rhTPO may produce immunogenicity. Currently, TPO-RA is recommended for the treatment of CIT by consensus guidelines at home and abroad. The study was designed to explore the safety and efficacy of Herombopag in the treatment of tumour-associated thrombocytopenia.
