Identifying Circadian Rest-Activity Rhythm Disorders in Patients With Advanced Cancer
Circadian rest-Activity Rhythm disorders (CARDs) are common in patients with cancer, particularly in advanced disease. CARDs are associated with increased symptoms, poorer quality of life, poorer response to anticancer treatments and shorter survival.

The goal of this observational study is to see how common CARDs are in patients with advanced cancer and to characterise their rest and activity patterns in more detail.

A recent study has outlined a standard way to assess and diagnose a CARD.

This study aims to assess patients with advanced cancer for a CARD using a novel screening tool against this newly formed diagnostic criteria. Potentially modifiable risk factors will be considered along with associations between CARDs and symptoms, sleep preferences, sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, quality of life measures and predictors of survival.
