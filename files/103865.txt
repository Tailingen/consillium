Study of Safety and Pharmacokinetics of MK-8242 in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors (P07650)
This study is being done to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of MK-8242 and its active metabolite (M16) in participants with advanced solid tumors. In Part 1 of the study, the study drug dose will be escalated to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). In Part 2 of the study, the MTD will be confirmed and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RPTD) established; the effect of MK-8242 on liposarcoma and other tumor types will also be evaluated.
Solid Tumors
DRUG: MK-8242
Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), DLT was defined as: any drug-related hematologic toxicity ≥ Grade 3 lasting ≥1 week, ≥ Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding, ≥ Grade 3 neutropenia with infection OR non-hematologic DLTs that were any Grade 3, 4, or 5 toxicity with the following exceptions/clarifications: 1) Grade 3 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration were excluded from the determination of DLT if, in the opinion of the investigator and sponsor, they occurred in a setting of inadequate treatment, 2) Grade 3 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration were each considered a DLT if they persisted despite 72 hours of maximal supportive care measures or 3) Any abnormal non-hematological laboratory value ≥ Grade 3 (that is not attributable to any other causes) was considered a DLT only if medical intervention was required to treat the participant, the abnormality led to hospitalization, or the abnormality persisted for ≥1 week., Cycle 1 (21 days)
Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of MK-8242, PK plasma samples were to be collected at the following time points: 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8,and 12 hours after the first dose on Day 1; and 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 (Day 8) and 48 (Day 9) hours post-dose on Day 7., Cycle 1, Day 1 pre-dose and through 24 hours post dose; Cycle 1 Day 7 pre-dose and through 48 hours post dose|Time to Maximum Plasma Concentration (Tmax) of MK-8242, PK plasma samples were to be collected at the following time points: 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 hours after the first dose on Day 1; and 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 (Day 8) and 48 (Day 9) hours post-dose on Day 7., Cycle 1, Day 1 pre-dose and through 12 hours postdose; Cycle 1 Day 7 pre-dose and through 48 hours post dose|Area Under the Concentration Time Curve From Hour 0 to Hour 12 (AUC0-12) for MK-8242, PK plasma samples were to be collected at the following time points: 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 hours after the first dose on Day 1; and 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 (Day 8) and 48 (Day 9) hours post-dose on Day 7., Cycle 1, Day 1 and Day 7, Hour 0 through Hour 12|AUC at Time of Last Sample (AUClast) for MK-8242, PK plasma samples were to be collected at the following time points: 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 hours after the first dose on Day 1; and 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 (Day 8) and 48 (Day 9) hours post-dose on Day 7., Cycle 1, Day 1 pre-dose and through 12 hours post dose; Cycle 1 Day 7 pre-dose and through 48 hours post dose
Participants are considered to have completed the study after Cycle 12. Amendment 4 (14 April 2015) was done to allow participants on active treatment at the time the study was closed to enrollment to continue study treatment beyond Cycle 12 if deriving clinical benefit, at the Investigator's discretion.
