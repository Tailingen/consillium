A Study of YL202 in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer and Breast Cancer
This is a phase 1, multicenter, open-label, first-in-human study of YL202 conducted in the United States and China.

The study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of YL202 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated NSCLC or hormone receptor (HR)-positive and HER2-negative BC, which have been heavily treated by standard treatment.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer|Breast Cancer
DRUG: YL202
Evaluate the occurrence of DLTs during the first cycle, At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Evaluate the AEs as characterized by type, frequency, severity, timing, seriousness and relationship to study treatment, By the global end of trial date, approximately within 36 months
Characterize the PK parameter AUC, Approximately within 36 months|Characterize the PK parameter Cmax, Approximately within 36 months|Characterize the PK parameter Ctrough, Approximately within 36 months|Characterize the PK parameter CL, Approximately within 36 months|Characterize the PK parameter Vd, Approximately within 36 months|Characterize the PK parameter t1/2, Approximately within 36 months|Assess the incidence of anti-YL202 antibodies, Approximately within 36 months|Evaluate the objective response rate (ORR), ORR: defined as the proportion of patients who achieved a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)., Approximately within 36 months|Evaluate the disease control rate (DCR), DCR: defined as the proportion of patients who achieved a best overall response of CR, PR or stable disease (SD)., Approximately within 36 months|Evaluate the best tumor response, Best tumor response: defined as the maximum percentage change in the sum of longest dimensions of measurable lesion(s) at any time during the study., Approximately within 36 months
Evaluate the duration of response (DoR), DoR: defined as the time interval from the date of the first documentation of objective response (CR or PR) to the date of the first documentation of PD. The DoR will be assessed for patients with a response (CR or PR) only., Approximately within 36 months|Evaluate the time to response (TTR), TTR: defined as the time interval from the date of the first dose of study drug to the date of the first documentation of objective response (CR or PR)., Approximately within 36 months|Evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS), PFS: defined as the time interval from the date of the first dose of study drug to the date of first documentation of PD or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Approximately within 36 months|Evaluate the overall survival (OS), OS: defined as the time interval from the date of the first dose of study drug to the date of death due to any cause., Approximately within 36 months
