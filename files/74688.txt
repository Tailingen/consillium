AGuIX Nanoparticles With Radiotherapy Plus Concomitant Temozolomide in the Treatment of Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma
This is a phase I/II clinical trial evaluating the association of AGuIX nanoparticles with radiotherapy plus concomitant Temozolomide in the treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma.

The primary objectives of this study were to determine the recommended dose of AGuIX in combination with radiotherapy and TMZ during the concomitant radiochemotherapy period (phase I) and to estimate the efficacy of the combination radiochemotherapy + AGuIX (recommended dose), measured by the 6-month progression-free survival rate (PFS) (phase II)

Three dose levels of intravenous AGuIX nanoparticles will be explored: 50 mg/kg, 75 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg.
Glioblastoma
DRUG: Polysiloxane Gd-Chelates based nanoparticles (AGuIX)|RADIATION: radiotherapy|DRUG: Temozolomide
The recommended dose (phase I) of AGuIX in combination with TMZ and and radiotherapy during the radio-chemotherapy period, Only toxicities occurring during concomitant radiochemotherapy will be considered for the evaluation of Dose Limiting Toxicity radiotherapy during the radio-chemotherapy period is defined as the highest dose tested in which the % of dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) is less than 33%. DLT is defined as any grade 3-4 toxicity according to the NCI CTCAE v5.0 classification, except alopecia, nausea, and vomiting which can be quickly controlled with appropriate measures., during 6 weeks after the first injection of AGuIX|6-month Progression Free Survival (PFS) rate (phase II), 6 months from the start of treatment
