Treatment Patients With Pulmonary Metastasis of Liver Cancer With Apatinib Combination With TACE: a Clinical Study
This study mainly evaluate the clinical effect of Apatinib in the treatment of patients with pulmonary metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma.Half of participants will receive Apatinib and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) therapy in combination,while the other half will receive TACE therapy alone.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma|Pulmonary Metastasis
DRUG: Apatinib|PROCEDURE: TACE
Progress Free Survival, PFS is defined as the months that from the anticipation of the clinical-trial to the progress of hepatocellular cancer, Change from Baseline mRECIST at 12 months was assessed every 4 weeks up to 48 weeks. Data collection is from date of randomization until the date of first documented progression assessed up to 12 months.
overall survival, OS is defined as the months that from the anticipation of the clinical-trial to the death of patients., Survival assessed every 4 weeks up to 24 months following objective disease progression. Data collection is from date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 48 months.|Objective response rate, Time to progress of lung lesions which was confirmed by CT/MRI, 1 month post intervention|The Quality of Life, 0 to 24 months post intervention|Toxicity as measured by CTCAE V4.0, 0 to 24 months post intervention
Apatinib is a VEGFR targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which has preliminary demonstrated the efficacy and safety in treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma by phase II stage research. Pulmonary metastasis of hepatocellular cancer is one of the difficulties in clinical practice,because it's not sensitive to systemic chemotherapy.This phase â…¢ study aims to evaluates the efficacy and safety of the Apatinib in the treatment of advanced hepatocellular cancer with pulmonary metastasis.
