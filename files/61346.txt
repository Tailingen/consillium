Gene Signatures Searching of Sensitivity/Resistance to Neoadjuvant Radiotherapy in Patients With Resectable STS
To date, the radiation oncologist are missing biomarkers predictive of response/resistance to RT in order to identify patients who may benefit from RT and personalize the RT schedule. Our proposal is to conduct a cohort study aiming at identifying transcriptomic biomarkers predictive of sensitivity and/or resistance to RT in limbs STS patients
Soft Tissue Sarcomas
RADIATION: pre-operative radiation|PROCEDURE: Standard surgery after rpreoprative radiation
To define a transcriptomic signature of histological response to radiotherapy in STS patients using the percentage of residual viable cells as a clinical meaningful endpoint, Gene expression signature using RNAseq correlated to the percentage of residual viable cells on surgery specimen to define histological response., 36 months
To identify biomarkers of sensitivity or resistance to radiotherapy in STS patients using additional clinical endpoints, Gene expression signature using RNAseq correlated to the percentage of necrosis, the percentage of fibrosis, the local control at 1 and 2 years (1- and 2-year local / distant recurrence-free survival, the time To Relapse (TTR), the Disease Free Survival (DFS), The Quality of resection level based on the residual tumor (R) classification., 36 months
Whether RT should be performed pre or post-operatively is still a debated question. To date, the radiation oncologist are missing signature of response/resistance to RT in order to identify patients who may benefit from RT and personalize the RT schedule. Therefore, predicting the likelihood of response/resistance to RT is essential. The individual exploration with high-throughput approaches will participate in describing biological mechanisms involved in STS tumor cell pan-resistance, thus identifying potential molecular targets that could be inhibited to reverse intrinsic radioresistance. In this context, our proposal is to conduct a cohort study aiming at identifying transcriptomic signature predictive of sensitivity and/or resistance to RT in limbs STS patients.
