A Study of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in Combination With Standard of Care Treatments in Participants With Multiple Myeloma (MK-3475-023/KEYNOTE-023)
This is a study of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in combination with lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone in participants with refractory or relapsed and refractory Multiple Myeloma (rrMM), and in combination with carfilzomib and low-dose dexamethasone in participants with relapsed or refractory Multiple Myeloma (rMM).

This study was being done to find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/maximum administered dose (MAD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab when given in combination with standard of care (SOC) treatments in participants with rrMM or rMM. Preliminary efficacy data will also be assessed. There was no primary hypothesis associated with this study.

On 03-Jul-2017, the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) placed the rrMM cohort of this protocol on clinical hold based on safety data from two other pembrolizumab protocols: MK-3475-183 (NCT02576977) and MK-3475-185 (NCT02579863) presented to the Data Monitoring Committee.

On 15-Sep-2017, the US FDA placed the rMM cohort of this study on partial clinical hold. Enrollment was stopped and will not be reopened. Participants who are deriving clinical benefit were allowed to continue receiving study treatment until protocol-specific end of treatment, and then progress into long term safety and survival follow up. Participants who are not deriving clinical benefit, must stop study treatment and move into the long term safety and survival follow up.

Number of Participants Experiencing Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0 (NCI-CTCAE v.4.0), DLTs were assessed during Cycle 1 (28 days) and were defined as the occurrence of any of the following judged by the investigator to be possibly, probably or definitely related to study drug: Grade (Gr) 4 non-hematologic toxicity; Gr 4 hematologic toxicity lasting ≥7 days; Gr 3 non-hematologic toxicity lasting \>3 days; Gr 3 non-hematologic laboratory value if: medical intervention was required, abnormality led to hospitalization, was renal or liver function related, or persisted for \>1 week; Gr 3/4 febrile neutropenia; thrombocytopenia \<25,000 cells/mm\^3 (associated with bleeding requiring platelet transfusion or life-threatening bleeding); Gr 5 toxicity; or delay of \>1 week in initiating Cycle 2 or unable to complete 80% of treatment during the first course of therapy due to drug-related toxicity. DLTs for the rMM cohort were any drug-related adverse events that cannot be managed by dose modification. DLTs are reported for the maximum tolerated dose., Up to 28 days in Cycle 1|Number of Participants Who Experienced One or More Adverse Events (AEs), An adverse event was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered study treatment and did not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event could be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a preexisting condition that was temporally associated with the use of the study treatment was also an adverse event., Up to approximately 72.7 months|Number of Participants Who Discontinued Study Treatment Due to an Adverse Event (AE), An adverse event was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered study treatment and did not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event could be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a preexisting condition that was temporally associated with the use of the study treatment was also an adverse event., Up to approximately 72.7 months
Objective Response Rate (ORR) Evaluated According to the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) 2006 Response Criteria by Confirmed Investigator Assessment, ORR was the percentage of the participants who achieved at least a partial response (stringent complete response \[sCR\]+complete response \[CR\]+very good partial response \[VGPR\]+partial response \[PR\]).
