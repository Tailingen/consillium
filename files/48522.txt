CD8 Depleted, Non-engrafting, HLA Mismatched Unrelated Infusion With MDS and Secondary AML
The purpose of the study is to determine the safety of an investigational treatment for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) after the first therapy (such as azacitidine or decitabine) stops working or after progression of MDS to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Funding source - FDA OOPD.

The purpose of the study is to determine the safety of an investigational treatment for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) after the first therapy (such as azacitidine or decitabine) stops working or after progression of MDS to acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

Patients with advanced MDS are treated with hypomethylating agents (HMAs) such as azacitidine or decitabine. These medications can be effective for a few months to a few years, but usually lose effect eventually. This study is attempting to design a therapy called "non-engrafting, CD8 depleted donor lymphocyte infusion" or "NE-DLI" as a treatment for these diseases.
