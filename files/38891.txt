Mass Accumulation Rate (MAR) as a Predictive Biomarker in Multiple Myeloma
This study will collect bone marrow (BM) aspirate samples from patients with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) prior to the start of a new treatment regimen for the purposes of prospectively measuring single-cell mass accumulation rate (MAR) as a biomarker of patient response to that regimen.

The primary study objective is to explore whether the single-cell MAR biomarker can predict patient response in RRMM patients. In order to enable this primary objective, two patient cohorts will be required. First, a small vanguard cohort of patients with treatment naïve disease to define drug concentrations used for testing, and second, the main RRMM patient cohort. Data will be collected to estimate the biomarker's predictive properties (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity), and to support improvement of the MAR biomarker through additional research and discovery within the study dataset.
