Phase II of Zactima Maintenance for Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-small-cell Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC) Following Platinum-doublet Chemotherapy
This study is multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase II study comparing vandetanib (300mg daily) plus best supportive care (BSC) to placebo plus BSC as maintenance treatment in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, who have received and responded to prior platinum-doublet systemic chemotherapy. The primary objective of the study is to compare the Progression Free Survival (PFS) rate at 3 months in locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients with or without vandetanib maintenance.
NSCLC
DRUG: Vandetanib|DRUG: Placebo
Progression-free Survival (PFS) Rate at 3 Months, Progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 3 months is defined as the number of patients without evidence of progression or death after 3 months from randomisation among the PFS-evaluable patients., 12 weeks
Progression-free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) defined as the median time from randomization to death from any cause or first observed disease progression., Performed at baseline, every 4 weeks until Week 12 following randomization and then every 8 weeks until objective disease progression.|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) defined as the median time from randomization to death from any cause., Every 12 weeks unless the patient withdraws consent|Disease of Response (DOR), Number of patients showing Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR) or Stable Disease (SD) based on RECIST for the best response.

Number of patients showing Complete Response (CR, disappearance of all target lesions), Partial Response (PR, at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter) or Stable Disease (SD, Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD taking as references the smallest sum longest diameter since the treatment started) based on RECIST Criteria Version 1.0 (assessed by CT and/or MRI) for the best response, Performed at baseline, every 4 weeks until Week 12 following randomization and then every 8 weeks until objective disease progression.|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Number of patients showing Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) based on RECIST for the best response.

Number of patients showing Complete Response (CR, disappearance of all target lesions) or Partial Response (PR, at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter) based on RECIST Criteria Version 1.0 (assessed by CT and/or MRI) for the best response., Performed at baseline, every 4 weeks until Week 12 following randomization and then every 8 weeks until objective disease progression.
