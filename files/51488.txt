A Clinical Study of BioTTT001 in Combination With Toripalimab and Regorafenib in Patients With Colorectal Cancer
This is a phase I, open-label clinical study of BioTTT001 in combination with Toraplizumab and Regorafenib in patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer.
Colorectal Cancer Metastatic
BIOLOGICAL: BioTTT001 hepatic artery infusion|DRUG: toripalimab|DRUG: regorafenib
Incidence of adverse events, The incidence and severity of all types of adverse events evaluated based on NCI-CTCAE V5.0 assessment., From the enrollment to 28 days after the end-of-trial visit (i.e. end of treatment or early termination visit)|MTD, Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), 28 days within BioTTT001 injection in the monotherapy phase and combination therapy phase
Overall survival(OS), The time from the start of treatment to death for any cause, Every 3 months until consent withdraw, death, withdrawal study, or loss of follow-up, up to 100 weeks|Progression-free survival (PFS), The time from the start of treatment to progress disease or death for any cause, Every 4 weeks in the first 4 cycles ,then every 8 weeks until disease progression, consent withdraw, death or end of study during the combination therapy phase, up to 100 weeks.|Objective response rate (ORR), Objective response rate (ORR) as assessed by the investigators, Imaging was performed after completion of the monotherapy phase, and tumour assessment was performed every 4 weeks in the first 4 cycles ,then every 8 weeks during the combination therapy phase|Plasma adenovirus (ADV) copies, Pharmacokinetic Study (PK): Copies of ADV in plasma at various sampling points., 28 days within the first BioTTT001 injection dose|ADV copies in various sites, Viral Shedding Analysis: Copies of ADV in swabs of injection sites, rectal swabs, throat swabs, and urine samples at various sampling points., 28 days within the first BioTTT001 injection dose|Serum IL-12 level, Expression levels of IL-12 at various sampling points in serum., 28 days within the first BioTTT001 injection dose|Serum neutralizing antibody level, Immunogenicity assessment through adenovirus neutralizing antibody detection., 28 days within the first BioTTT001 injection dose
This study includes a dose escalation phase and a dose expansion phase. The dose escalation phase will adopt a 3+3 design. Subjects were first treated with BioTTT001 monotherapy (hepatic artery infusion, administered every 2 weeks, D1 and D15 for a total of two doses) after enrollment. If the subject does not develop dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in the monotherapy stage and is judged to be safe and tolerable by the investigator, the subject will enter the treatment phase of BioTTT001 in combination with toripalimab and regorafenib( toripalimab 80mg iv. D1 and D15 , BioTTT001 5×10\^7 viral particle (VP)/5×10\^8 VP/5×10\^9 VP/1×10\^10 VP hepatic arterial infusion (HAI.) D2 and D16 , regorafenib 80 mg Po. D1-D21; 4 weeks per cycle), and the dose of BioTTT001 will be determined according to the safety observation results in the monotherapy phase. In the dose expansion phase, different dose groups can be expanded, and the total number of enrolled subjects is expected to be 30 for further safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy evaluation.
