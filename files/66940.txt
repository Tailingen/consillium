Rehabilitation With an Obturator in Maxillary Defects
During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a lot of reporting of COVID-19-associated mucormycosis cases. Managing this condition posed a new challenge to clinicians. Management includes therapeutic drugs and aggressive surgical debridement. Due to the unpredictability of disease prognosis and the possible recurrence of the disease, rehabilitation with delayed surgical obturators is beneficial for patients. Hence, the current study aimed to evaluate the impact of delayed surgical obturators on quality of life of COVID-19-associated mucormycosis patients post-maxillectomies

Oral healthy related quality of life (oral health impact profile-49)) (OHIP-49), The OHIP-14 is a self-filled questionnaire developed by Locker and Slade that focuses on 7 dimensions of impact: functional limitation (questions #1,2), physical pain (questions #3,4), psychological discomfort (questions #5,6), physical disability (questions #7,8), psychological disability(question #9,10), social disability (question #11,12), and handicap (question #13,14), with participants being asked to respond according to the frequency of impact on a 5-point Likert scale coded as never (score 0), hardly ever (score 1), occasionally (score2), fairly often (score 3), and very often (score 4). The OHIP-14 is a shorter version of the OHIP-49 but retains the original conceptual dimensions contained in the OHIP-49., 6 months
Globally, the prevalence of mucormycosis varied from 0.005 to 1.7 per million population, while its prevalence is nearly 80 times higher (0.14 per 1000) in India compared to developed countries, in a recent estimate of year 2019-2020.

Among the medical professionals involved in managing patients with mucormycosis, maxillofacial prosthodontists are responsible for prosthetic restoration of lost oral and maxillofacial structures, helping patients to socialize and have an acceptable quality of life after surgical treatment
