CR defined as disappearance of all target lesions (TL) since baseline. Any pathological lymph nodes selected as TLs must have a reduction in short axis to \<10mm. PR defined as \>= 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions (compared to baseline sum of diameters).

Assessed up to date of DCO (05Jan24) to a maximum of approximately 63 months|Disease Control Rate by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), Percentage of patients who have a best overall response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) as assessed by BICR, Every 8 weeks for first 48 weeks, then every 12 weeks until BICR-confirmed radiological disease progression. Assessed up to date of DCO (05Jan24) to a maximum of approximately 63 months|Tumour Shrinkage by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), Depth of response (or tumour shrinkage or change in tumour size) was assessed using BICR responses in target lesions. The best change in tumour size is the largest decrease from baseline or the smallest increase from baseline in the absence of a reduction, Every 8 weeks for first 48 weeks, then every 12 weeks until BICR-confirmed radiological disease progression. Assessed up to date of DCO (05Jan24) to a maximum of approximately 63 months|Proportion With Tumour Shrinkage by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), Proportion with depth of response (or tumour shrinkage or change in tumour size), Every 8 weeks for first 48 weeks, then every 12 weeks until BICR-confirmed radiological disease progression.

Distant metastasis is defined as any new lesion that is detected on a scan that is anywhere other than lung or regional lymph node according to RECIST v1.1 or proven by biopsy, Time from randomisation to the date of distant metastases or death. Assessed up to date of DCO (05Jan24) to a maximum of approximately 63 months|Time to Study Treatment Discontinuation, Time from randomisation to the earlier of the date of study treatment discontinuation (regardless of the reason for study treatment discontinuation) or death (i.e. date of study treatment discontinuation/death or censoring - date of randomisation + 1 day, expressed in months), Time from randomisation to the earlier of the date of study treatment discontinuation or death. Assessed up to date of DCO (05Jan24) to a maximum of approximately 63 months|Time to First Subsequent Treatment, Time from the date of randomisation to the earlier of the date of anti-cancer therapy start date following study drug discontinuation or death, Time from randomisation to the start of first subsequent anti-cancer therapy or death.

Assessed up to date of DCO (05Jan24) to a maximum of approximately 63 months|Second Progression-free Survival (PFS2), Time from randomisation to the earliest progression event following first objective disease progression, subsequent to the first subsequent therapy, or death., Every 8 weeks for first 48 weeks, then every 12 weeks.

This is a phase 3 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, study to assess the efficacy and safety of osimertinib following chemoradiation in patients with stage III unresectable EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC, including the most common EGFR sensitising mutations (Ex19Del and L858R), either alone or in combination with other EGFR mutations. Chemoradiation may have been given either given concurrently or sequentially. Patients whose disease has not progressed following chemoradiation will be randomised within 6 weeks of completion of chemoradiation to receive osimertinib or placebo in a 2:1 ratio, and treatment will be continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or other discontinuation criteria are met. After progression, patients can be unblinded and may receive open-label osimertinib. After the final OS analysis, the study blind will be broken and patients still receiving open-label osimertinib will be supplied with open-label osimertinib by AstraZeneca for as long as their treating physician considers they are deriving clinical benefit.
