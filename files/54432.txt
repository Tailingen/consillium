A Study of BA1202 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm phase I study in patients with advanced solid tumors which consists of a dose escalation part (Part A) and a dose extension part (Part B).

Part A aims to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BA1202, and determine the MTD. Part B will also evaluate the preliminary efficacy of BA1202.
