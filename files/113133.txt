Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma, Erbitux, and Particle Therapy
The ACCEPT (A(denoid) c(ystic) c(arcinoma), E(rbitux, and) p(article) t(herapy))-trial is a prospective, monocentric phase I/II feasibility trial evaluating toxicity and efficacy in the combined treatment of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and carbon ion (C12) boost with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibody cetuximab. The primary objective of the study is to explore the toxicity of the combined modality regimen consisting of heavy ion therapy / IMRT and EGFR antibody immunotherapy, by assessing the rate of patients with mucositis or any other toxicity of severity grade 3 or 4 according to NCI CTCAE V. 4. Secondary endpoints include local control, distant control, overall disease-free survival, overall survival

local relapse-free survival, Local relapse-free survival will be defined as the time from the initial dose of study therapy to the time of locoregional disease progression or relapse or death, or to the date of last assessment without any such event (censored observation), at 3 years post treatment|distant relapse-free survival, Distant relapse-free survival will be defined as the time from the initial dose of study therapy to the time of distant metastasis detection or death, or to the date of last assessment without any such event (censored observation), at 3 years post treatment|overall disease-free survival, Distant disease-free survival will be defined as the time from the initial dose of study therapy to the time of any detection of adenoid cystic carcinoma relapse or development of secondary cancer or death, or to the date of last assessment without any such event (censored observation), at 3 years post treatment|overall survival, The duration of survival will be determined by measuring the time interval from initial dose of study therapy to the date of death of any cause or last observation (censored), at 3 years post treatment
Treatment with novel radiotherapeutic technologies could increase local control in adenoid cystic carcinoma of the head and neck. Especially combined treatment with intensity-modulated radiation therapy and heavy ion (C12) boost to the primary tumor or previous tumor bed could be established as the treatment of choice in this disease.

Unfortunately, therapeutic results in the treatment of adenoid cystic carcinoma are still hampered by the occurrence of distant metastases (predominantly in the lungs) which, though progressing comparatively slowly, still limit the patient's life expectancy. Most adenoid cystic carcinomas (\> 80%) though, exhibit over-expression of EGFR receptors and hence provide an approach for systemic treatment. In this prospective phase II trial, the application of the EGFR antibody cetuximab will be evaluated in combination with the established treatment of intensity-modulated radiation therapy plus C12 heavy ion boost.

The trial aims at evaluation of toxicity and feasibility of the combined treatment, as primary endpoint, as well as local control and disease-free survival as secondary endpoints.
