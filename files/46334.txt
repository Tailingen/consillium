A First in Human Study to Evaluate the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics Effects of OC514
Oncocross is developing OC514, a drug-drug combination product containing 2 active pharmaceutical ingredients for cancer cachexia. This study is designed to assess the safety and tolerability of single and multiple oral doses of OC514 in healthy adult volunteers.

This is a single-center study in which a total of 24 subjects will be enrolled into 1 of 3 dose level cohorts in an ascending fashion. Each cohort will consist of 8 subjects randomized to receive OC514 or matching placebo at a ratio of 3:1. Eligible subjects will be admitted to the clinical research unit (CRU) from Day -1 to 5 and again from Day 15 to Day 17 and will be discharged upon completion of post-dose assessment. The subjects will attend the CRU for outpatients visits on Day 8 and Day 12. The subjects will return for a follow-up visit on Day 19 and End of Study visit on Day 21.

The total study duration is up to 9 weeks consisting of up to 6 weeks of screening, 2 weeks of blinded treatment, and 1 week of safety follow-up.

Safety oversight will be provided by a Safety Review Committee (SRC).
