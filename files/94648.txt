To Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Gefitinib in Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Lung Adenocarcinoma
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of targeted gefitinib versus oral vinorelbine and carboplatin in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of targeted gefitinib versus oral vinorelbine and carboplatin in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients. The purpose is to explore the role of TKI in neoadjuvant therapy, and to further improve disease-free survival (DFS) and pathologic complete remission (pCR) in EGFR-mutant populations; and reduce surgical complications and mortality.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of oral gefitinib versus neoadjuvant vinorelbine and carboplatin in operable stage II-IIIA EGFR-mutant non-squamous NSCLC patients, with a 2-year disease-free survival rate. 2yDFS).

Secondary objective: To evaluate pCR, 0RR, and other efficacy measures (safety, complete) for oral gefitinib vs. neoadjuvant vinorelbine and carboplatin in patients with operable stage II-IIIA EGFR-mutant non-squamous cell carcinoma NSCLC. Resection rate, tumor regression, mediastinal lymph node clearance, perioperative complications, and mortality rate).
