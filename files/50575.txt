Quantitative Assessment of Blood Supply in the Gastic Conduit With Fluorescence Angiography for Esophageal Reconstruction
A single-institution, randomize controlled trial is to be held to evaluate the correlation between blood supply in the gastic conduit and the incidence of anastomotic fistula during radical operation for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma by fluorescence angiography.
Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: Fluorescence angiography
The incidence of anastomotic fistula, Anastomotic fistula is defined as an anastomotic fistula or any anastomotic dehiscence or leakage of saliva from a neck wound, confirmed by gastroscopy or upper gastrointestinal angiography, or purulent discharge from the chest or mediastinal drainage catheter. In addition, in this study, occult fistula was not included in the anastomotic fistula group when invasive treatment was not required., 3 months
