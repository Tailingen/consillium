Volumetric Analysis of Hepatocellular Carcinoma After Transarterial Chemoembolization
The application of transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) with drug-eluting beads in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and its response to the treatment will be observed. The registry has the following objectives:

To assess the response to the treatment by standard methods and volumetric analysis as well as trying to determine any predictive response factors To determinate interobserver variability of the methods.

The patients with hepatocellular carcinoma in stage suitable for treatment by transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) with drug-eluting beads are included in the study. The investigators assess the response to the treatment by standard methods (RECIST, mRECIST) as well as by volumetric analysis. The size of tumor is evaluated on CT/MRI by two investigators prior to first TACE and then on all the check-ups (routinely every three months) until 31 December, 2019 or the patients' death.
