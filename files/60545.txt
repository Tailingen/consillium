Comparative Study on the Effects of Epidural Dexmedetomidine on Heart Rate Variability During General Anesthesia in Patients Undergoing Gastrectomy
The use of epidural dexmedetomidine decreases the anaesthetic requirements and improved postoperative pain. Dexmedetomidine is a potent and highly selective a2-adrenoceptor agonist and has sympatholytic effect. Power spectral analysis of heart rate variability(HRV) is a useful tool to assess cardiac autonomic activity. We investigated whether preemptive epidural dexmedetomidine can develop hemodynamic change and it could be identify patients by HRV.
Gastric Cancer
DRUG: preemptive dexmedetomidine epidural bolus injection(1.5 mcg/kg)|DRUG: normal saline
Heart rate variability analysis, Heart rate variability analysis was performed according to the Task Force recommendations.

Frequency domain analysis was based on fast Fourier transformation. Power spectrum densities were calculated for low frequencies (LF: 0.04-0.15 Hz) and high frequencies (HF: 0.15-0.4 Hz) informalized units, defined as the LF or HF proportional part of the total power.

Baseline and 30min after the injection of the study drug., 5min perioids after fluid resuscitation.
Epidural injection, And secondary data collection was done at 30 min after the epidural injection of the study drug.

All of the HRV analysis was done before anaesthesia induction., at 30 min after the epidural injection of the study drug
