Conversion Therapy of Sintilimab in Combination With Apatinib and Chemotherapy in Stage IV Gastric Cancer
This is a single-arm, phase II study aiming to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of sintilimab (PD-1 inhibitor) in combination of apatinib and two-drug chemotherapy (S-1 plus nab-paclitaxel) as conversion therapy in patients with stage IV gastric cancer in China.
Gastric Cancer Stage IV
DRUG: sintilimab|DRUG: apatinib|DRUG: S1|DRUG: Nab paclitaxel
R0-surgery conversion rate, The proportion of participants who underwent R0 surgery among all participants., up to one year
objective response rate (ORR), The proportion of participants who achieved complete response(CR) or partial response(PR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria (RECIST v1.1)., up to one year|disease control rate (DCR), The proportion of participants who achieved CR, PR or stable disease(SD) per RECIST v1.1., up to one year|conversion rate, The proportion of participants who underwent surgery among all participants., up to one year|overall survival (OS), The time from the first dose of the study treatment to death from any cause., up to two years|event-free survival (EFS), The time from the first dose of the study treatment to any of the following events: progression of disease, local or distant recurrence, or death due to any cause., up to two years|Treatment-Related Adverse Events (TRAEs), The grade and proportion of participants who experienced TRAEs per National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03, from the first day of treatment until 1 month after the end of treatment|surgery-related complications, Incidence and grade of surgery-related complications as assessed byper the Clavien-Dindo classification, from the day of surgery to 30 days postoperatively
pathological response, Pathological response of the primary tumor was graded according to tumor regression grade (TRG) as follows: 0. (CR), no viable cancer cells, including lymph nodes; 1. (near CR), single cells or rare small groups of cancer cells; 2. (PR), residual cancer cells with evident tumor regression but more than single cells or rare small groups of cancer cells; and 3. (poor or no response), extensive residual cancer with no evident tumor regression., up to one year after surgery
