Nimotuzumab Combined With TGP as First-line Therapy in Patients With Recurrent/Metastatic Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
The goal of this study is to learn the efficacy and safety of nimotuzumab combined with toripalimab and gemcitabine/cisplatin regimen treatment recurrent/distant-metastasis nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

The study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of combining nimotuzumab and toripalimab with the GP regimen for first line recurrent/distant metastasis nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

This clinical trial adopts a single-center, prospective, single-arm phase II trial design. Each treatment cycle will be three weeks long, the chemotherapy regimen contains no more than 6 circles, nimotuzumab and toripalimab were used until progression.

After screening, eligible patients will be enrolled in the study. Patients will receive up to 6 cycles of nimotuzumab and toripalimab, gemcitabine, cisplatin therapy. Patients will undergo regular follow-up visits, and researchers will collect data on efficacy and safety. Short-term outcomes will be assessed according to the RECIST 1.1 criteria/irRECIST, and adverse events will be evaluated using the CTCAE 5.0.
