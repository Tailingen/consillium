Use of Indocyanine Green in Robotic Prostate Surgeries
Imaging of the vascular nerve bundle using Indocyanine Green
Prostate Cancer Adenocarcinoma|Erectile Dysfunction Following Radical Prostatectomy
DRUG: using Indocyanine Green|PROCEDURE: Nerve-sparing robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy
Evaluation of erectile function., Evaluation of erectile function after Nerve Sparing Robot Assisted Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy with and without the application of Indocyanine Green.Evaluation of surgical margin positivity after Nerve Sparing Robot Assisted Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy with and without the application of Indocyanine Green.

Both groups will evaluate their erectile function by completing the preoperative International Index of Erectile Function Every groups of participants will fill the International Index of Erectile Function -5 again after surgery in 3. -6. -9. -12 months.

The possible scores for the International Index of Erectile Function- 5 range from 0 to 30, and Erectile disfonction is classified into five categories based on the scores: severe (0-10), moderate (11-16), mild to moderate (17-21), mild (22-25), and no erectile disfonction (26-30)., up to 12 months|Evaluation of surgical margin positivity, Postoperative surgical margin positivity will be compared in both groups according to the results of the postoperative pathology report. Surgical margin positivity in both groups will be evaluated as a percentage and it will be evaluated whether there is a significant difference between the two groups, Up to 12 months
Comparison of erectile function and surgical margin positivity after nerve-sparing robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy surgery performed by imaging the vascular nerve bundle using Indocyanine Green with the results after nerve-sparing robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy surgery without Indocyanine Green
