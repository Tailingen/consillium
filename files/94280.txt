FOLFOX + Panitumumab According to a "Stop and go" Strategy With a Reintroduction Loop After Progression on Fluoropyrimidine as Maintenance Treatment, as the First Line in Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Adenocarcinoma Without a RAS Mutation
Single-arm, multi-centre phase II study The primary objective is to evaluate the time to failure of the strategy.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
COMBINATION_PRODUCT: FOLFOX + panitumumab
Time to failure of the strategy, Time to strategy Failure is defined as the time from date of inclusion to strategy failure (Radiological progression under treatment or death or definitive treatment discontinuation or recurrence after curative surgery with or without adjuvant treatment), Up to 20 months
The purpose of the OPTIPRIME phase II non-randomised study is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of the combination of FOLFOX plus panitumumab according to a "stop and go" strategy. If disease control is achieved while on induction treatment, oxaliplatin and panitumumab will be stopped after the sixth cycle; a maintenance treatment of fluoropyrimidine alone will be continued. In case of progression during maintenance treatment, oxaliplatin and panitumumab reintroduction loops will take place according to the same regimen (maintenance treatment after six cycles of the reintroduced therapy if disease control is achieved).
