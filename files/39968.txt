PENS or TENS for Pain in Liver Cancer
This study evaluates the effect of percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (PENS) and transcutaneous nerve stimulation (TENS) for pain relieving in patients with liver cancer. Patients will randomly allocated into PENS group, Tens group and control group.
Pain|Cancer Pain|Liver Neoplasms
DEVICE: PENS|DEVICE: TENS
pain score, pain score assessed via visual analogue scale (VAS), day0 to day6
quantity of analgesic medication, decreasing in quantity of analgesic medication, day0 to Day6|times of breakthrough pain (BTP), times of BTP per day, day0 to day6
complications, any correlated complications happen during procedure, day1 to day3
PENS and TENS have been reported with analgesic effect in patients with pain, including cancer pain, lower back pain, neck pain, stomachache and so on. Effect and mechanism of PENS on pain relieving has been widely researched. With additional electrical stimulation in certain frequency and intensity to conventional acupuncture, pain controlling effect has been largely enhanced. However, invasive operation limits its application and acceptability, especially on pancreatic cancer. TENS is an advanced technique generated from PENS, which is much more welcome for its noninvasive character. Further more, its analgesic effect on cancer pain has been proved by several multi-central, randomized, clinical trials.
