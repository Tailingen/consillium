Safety Study of the Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor, CHR-3996, in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumours
CHR-3996 is one of a new class of anti-cancer agents - histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) - that has exhibited pleiotropic activity both in vitro and in vivo against a range of human cancer cells. Regulation of the acetylation of both histone and non-histone proteins by histone deacetylase enzymes is one of the key mechanisms involved in epigenetic control of gene expression. HDACi have demonstrated activity in both in vitro cytotoxicity, and in vivo tumour xenograft studies
