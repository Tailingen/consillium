Longitudinal Study on the Evolution Trend and Influencing Factors of Postoperative Reflux of Esophageal Cancer Based on PEPTEST Technique
The goal of this observational study intends to explore the evolution trend and related factors of postoperative reflux of esophageal cancer based on PEPTEST detection, in order to identify postoperative reflux

The main question it aims to answer are:

to provide evidence for high-risk groups, improvement of surgical methods for esophageal cancer, and development of health education programs to prevent postoperative reflux.

Using convenient sampling method, patients undergoing esophagectomy in thoracic surgery Department of Cancer Hospital of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences from January 1, 2023 were continuously enrolled. PEPTEST was performed once before surgery, before discharge, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after surgery.

The incidence of pathological reflux at 5 time points before and after surgery was observed and compared (that is, both T-line and C-line were shown). The trend of pepsin content in saliva before and after operation; The relationship between pathological reflux and surgical factors; The relationship between pathological reflux and life habits after operation; Relationship between pathological regurgitation and demographic characteristics.

The subjects of this study were selected from the patients who underwent esophagectomy in the Department of Thoracic Surgery of Cancer Hospital of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences from January 1, 2023 to December 1, 2023, and the patients who underwent esophagectomy in the Department of thoracic surgery of Cancer Hospital of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences from January 1, 2023. PEPTEST was performed once before surgery, before discharge, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after surgery. To describe the evolution trend of postoperative reflux in patients with esophageal cancer can be used for anticipatory sexual health education. To explore the relevant factors of reflux: to identify the inherent factors, such as gender, BMI, etc., to give preventive intervention to high-risk groups; The variable factors such as the length and width of the tube stomach can be improved.
