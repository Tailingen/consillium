A Study of SPX-303, a Bispecific Antibody Targeting LILRB2 and PD-L1 in Patients With Solid Tumors
Part 1 of this study is an open-label, dose-escalation, and safety expansion study of an anti-LILRB2 / anti-PD-L1 bispecific antibody SPX- 303 in patients with solid tumors. Part 2 of this study is an indication-specific dose expansion study of SPX-303.
Solid Tumor|HNSCC|RCC|CRC
BIOLOGICAL: SPX- 303 Injection, a bispecific anti-LILRB2 / anti-PD-L1 Antibody
Part 1: Number of participants with dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), A DLT is defined as the clinically significant TRAE(treatment-related adverse events) or abnormal laboratory values assessment during the first 21 days of Cycle 1 and excludes events that are deemed clearly related to underlying disease, progression, or intercurrent illness., First 21 days of Cycle 1|Part 1: Treatment-Related Adverse Events (TRAE), Treatment related adverse events (TRAEs) by seriousness per CTCAE v. 5.0. as well as tolerability (TRAEs leading to discontinuation, TRAEs leading to dose delays, duration of TRAEs, and semi-quantitative assessments of TRAE treatments), 3.5 years|Part 1: Potential Phase 2 dose (RP2D) to be further evaluated in Part 2, Up to 10 patients will be evaluated for safety and tolerability at maximum tolerated dose/maximum accpeted dose or a lower, already cleared dose level., 3-6 months|Part 2: Phase 2 dose (RP2D) determination, RP2D is determined evaluating two dose levels in each specific indications., 1-3 years
Part 1: Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST v 1.1., 1-3 years|Part 1: Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the participant's initial objective response (CR or PR) to disease progression per CTCAE v5.0 or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., 1-3 years|Part 1: Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as percentage of participants with complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) per CTCAE v5.0., 1-3 years|Part 1: Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the interval of time between the date of first treatment to the earliest date of disease progression per CTCAE v5.0 or death which occurs first., 1-3 years|Part 1: Pharmacokinetics (PK), PK is evaluated using serum concentration of SPX-303., 1-3 years|Part 1: Pharmacodynamics (PD), PD is evaluated using receptor occupancy of SPX-303., 1-3 years|Part 2: Preliminary anti-tumor activity at RP2D, Preliminary anti-tumor activity is evaluated in RP2D cohorts., 1-3 years
This study is an open-label, dose escalation study of SPX-303 monotherapy to evaluate safety and tolerability, and to identify the MTD or MAD as well as evaluate preliminary anti-tumor efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of various doses of SPX- 303 in patients with measurable disease who have progressed on or after prior therapy and who are not eligible or decline treatment options.
