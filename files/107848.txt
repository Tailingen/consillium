Evaluating the Effectiveness of an Early Exercise Program After Breast Reconstruction
Breast reconstruction is an important step and option after mastectomy and can help improve the quality of life of breast cancer patients. Therefore, the proportion of patients undergoing breast reconstruction in conjunction with mastectomy is steadily increasing. Despite recent advances in less invasive techniques, postoperative movement restrictions are unavoidable, and these postoperative pain or functional limitations can last for months to years. Patients most often experience a decrease in shoulder function, which negatively impacts their physical function and is an important factor in their ability to perform activities of daily living. Early postoperative exercise has been proven to have positive results in promoting the recovery of shoulder function in breast cancer patient. However, there is a lack of research on the effectiveness of early postoperative exercise in the context of breast reconstruction. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the effect of early postoperative exercise on patients' shoulder and trunk function after breast reconstruction.
