Safety Study of Adjuvant Docetaxel-Carboplatin Treatment for Resected Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine whether it is safe to treat lung cancer patients who have undergone an attempt at curative resection with the combination of docetaxel and carboplatin.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Docetaxel-Carboplatin
Febrile Neutropenia, The primary endpoint of the study was safety, as reflected by a febrile neutropenia rate of \<10%., 2 months
Patients with stage Ib - IIIa NSCLC participated in an open-label, single arm study to assess the safety and tolerability of docetaxel (75 mg/kg) and carboplatin (AUC 5.5) administered for 3 cycles after resection for curative intent. The primary endpoint of the study was safety, as reflected by a febrile neutropenia rate of \<10%. Other endpoints assessed protocol compliance and the impact of minimally invasive surgical technique.
