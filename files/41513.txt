Effectiveness of Intercostal Tube Drainage Vs Pigtail Catheter Drainage Vs Ultrasound-Guided Aspiration in Management of Massive Malignant Pleural Effusion
Pleural effusion is common in different diseases and especially malignant effusions can have fast onset symptoms such as chest pain, dyspnoea, and coughing. Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is an exudative effusion with malignant cells.

It is a common symptom and accompanying presentation of metastatic disease. It Impacts up to 15% of all patients with cancer and is the most common in breast, lung, cancer, lymphoma, and gynaecological malignancies . There are 150,000 new cases of MPE in the United States yearly and 100,000 in Europe . Patients have an overall survival (OS) rate of 3-12 months after the initial diagnosis . Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) poses significant challenges in management, impacting patient quality of life and overall prognosis. Almost all radiological procedures can help diagnose pleural effusions . Thoracentesis is used as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool. The procedure has been modified with the addition of ultrasound, that is very functional for targeting certain anatomical areas of the pleura and finding an appropriate entry point . Three primary strategies are commonly employed: intercostal tube drainage, big tail catheter drainage, and ultrasound-guided aspiration. This study aims to evaluate these methods' efficacy, safety, and outcomes. To compare intercostal tube drainage, big tail catheter drainage, and ultrasound-guided aspiration in managing massive malignant pleural effusion (MPE).
