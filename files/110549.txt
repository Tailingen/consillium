Investigating the Biological Effects of the Addition of Zoledronic Acid to Pre-operative Chemotherapy in Breast Cancer
There is clear preclinical in vitro and in vivo evidence of sequence dependent synergy between chemotherapy agents and zoledronic acid. The aim of the study is to investigate if the synergistic increase in tumour cell apoptosis observed in preclinical studies occurs in patients. The hypothesis for this study is that there may be anti-tumour benefits of the sequential application of chemotherapy agents followed by zoledronic acid in patients with invasive breast cancer.
