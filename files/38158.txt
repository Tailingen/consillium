A Pilot Study to Evaluate Radiotherapy-Induced Anti-Tumor Immunity in Metastatic Carcinoma of the Pancreas
Primary Objective: To estimate the rate at which radiotherapy to the primary or a metastatic lesion produces an immune response in patients with metastatic carcinoma of the pancreas.

Secondary Objectives: To characterize the kinetics of an immune response induced by radiotherapy. To characterize the dependency of the immune response on prior exposure to chemotherapy.
