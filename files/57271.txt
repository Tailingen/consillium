Determining the Lymphokine Activated Killer (LAK) Cytotoxicity Present in Patients Undergoing Interleukin-2 Therapy
Therapy with Interleukin-2 stimulates lymphocytes in humans to become Lymphokine-activated Killer cells (LAK). This study will determine if these killer cells are able to kill certain standard cell-lines in the laboratory.

LAK cytotoxicity, 4 months
Blood samples will be taken from patients undergoing outpatient Interleukin-2 therapy to measure the LAK cytotoxicity at baseline, after 1 cycle of therapy and 2 months later. The LAK cytotoxicity assay will be a standard colorimetric assay that measures lactic dehydrogenase release from lysed cells.
