Regorafenib in Combination With Metronomic Chemotherapies, and Low-dose Aspirin in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
The investigators propose a phase II clinical trial with the objective to investigate the potential clinical interest to associate regorafenib with a metronomic chemotherapy combining capecitabine, cyclophosphamide and low-dose aspirin, for the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. The main objective of the study will be to achieve 15% of objective response rate in patients treated with multimodal metronomic chemotherapy and regorafenib.
