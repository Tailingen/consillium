Adaptive Therapy for Resected Stage ⅠB-Ⅱ NSCLC Patients With Undetectable MRD
It is a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial to investigate the predictive value of MRD on adjuvant therapy. Stage IB-II resected EGFR/ALK negative NSCLC patients will undergo two-round MRD tests after surgery, first in 3-7 days and second in 1 month after surgery. And patients who confirm two-round landmark undetectable MRD will be enrolled and randomly assigned to the conventional treatment group or the adaptive therapy group . Patients in the the adaptive therapy group will undergo closely MRD and imaging monitoring without adjuvant therapy if the MRD was negative.
