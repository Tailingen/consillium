Concurrent Chemotherapy Based on Genetic Testing in Patients With High-Risk Salivary Gland Tumors
The role of postoperative concurrent chemotherapy (CCT) has not been established for salivary gland tumors (SGTs). This prospective study was conducted to evaluate the feasibility and safety of customized CCT regimens based on the gene targets of SGTs.
