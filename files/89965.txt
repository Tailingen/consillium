Application of Detecting Circulating Tumor Cells in the Accurate Treatment of Early Stage Lung Adenocarcinoma
In 2015-2016, 224,390 cases were newly diagnosed with lung cancer in USA. Of all the cases, 83% are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Currently, the 5-year survival rate of NSCLC patients is 21%, and more than 25% of early stage NSCLC patients, who have undergone surgical treatment, will have a relapse or progression.

Circulating tumor cells (CTCs), which shed from the primary tumor into the vasculature or lymphatics, can be regarded as a new prognostic factors of metastatic process. Thus far, CTCs-detection technologies can be divided into epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM)-based detection methods, e.g., the widely used CellSearch® and Adnatest®,and EpCAM-independent detection methods, e.g., ISET® and ScreenCell®. Herein, the investigators used a newly established approach, i.e., CanPatrolTM to detect CTCs in early stage lung Adenocarcinoma cases.

The investigator aim to explore whether CTCs detection prior to surgery can be contributive to the early diagnosis, or may help to predict the prognosis and guide the treatment strategy of early stage lung Adenocarcinoma.
