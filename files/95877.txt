Interleukin-2 and Stem Cell Factor in Treating Patients With AIDS or AIDS-Related Cancer
RATIONALE: Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill cancer cells. Stem cell factor may increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help a person's immune system recover from the side effects of cancer therapy.

PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining interleukin-2 with stem cell factor in treating patients who have AIDS or AIDS-related cancer.
Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: aldesleukin|BIOLOGICAL: recombinant human stem cell factor
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the safety and toxicity of low-dose interleukin-2 and stem cell factor in patients with AIDS or AIDS-related malignancies.
* Determine the immune status of patients treated with this regimen.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of stem cell factor.

Patients receive interleukin-2 (IL-2) subcutaneously (SC) six days a week and stem cell factor SC three times a week for 8 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of stem cell factor until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, an additional cohort of 3 patients receives treatment at the MTD.

Patients are followed every 2 weeks for 1 month.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-18 patients will be accrued for this study.
