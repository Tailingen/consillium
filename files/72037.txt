DRUG: PLX3397
Summary of Best Overall Response Following Twice Daily Administration of PL3397 at 1000 mg/Day In Participants With Unresectable or Advanced KIT-mutated Melanoma, For the assessment of best overall response, participants were classified by RECIST v1.1: complete response (CR), disappearance of all target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level; partial response (PR), at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters; stable disease (SD); neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study; progressive disease (PD), at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study and the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm; or not evaluable (NE) for analysis., within 18 months postdose|Objective Response Rate (ORR) Following Twice Daily Administration of PL3397 at 1000 mg/Day In Participants With Unresectable or Advanced KIT-mutated Melanoma, Objective response rate was defined as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)., within 18 months postdose
Duration of Response Following Twice Daily Administration of PL3397 at 1000 mg/Day In Participants With Unresectable or Advanced KIT-mutated Melanoma, Duration of Response (DoR) was defined as the time from the first documentation of objective tumor response (complete response \[CR\] or partial response \[PR\]) to the first documentation of disease progression or to death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. DoR was to only be calculated for the subgroup of participants with an objective tumor response., within 18 months postdose|Progression-free Survival Following Twice Daily Administration of PL3397 at 1000 mg/Day In Participants With Unresectable or Advanced KIT-mutated Melanoma, Progression-free survival (PFS) was to be calculated for each participant as the number of days from study enrollment to the date of the first documented disease progression or date of death from any cause, whichever occurred first., within 18 months postdose|Overall Survival Twice Daily Administration of PL3397 at 1000 mg/Day In Participants With Unresectable or Advanced KIT-mutated Melanoma, Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from study enrollment to death from any cause, censoring at the date of last contact or the end of the study., within 18 months postdose|Disease Control Rate Following Twice Daily Administration of PL3397 at 1000 mg/Day In Participants With Unresectable or Advanced KIT-mutated Melanoma, Disease control rate (DCR) was defined as the percentage of participants who had achieved complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD)., within 18 months postdose|Summary of Pharmacokinetic Parameter of Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of PL3397 at Days 1 and 15 Following Twice Daily Administration of PL3397 at 1000 mg/Day in Participants With Unresectable or Advanced KIT-mutated Melanoma, Cycle 1, Day 1 and Day 15 at predose, 0.5 h, 1h, 2h, 4h, and 6h postdose|Summary of Pharmacokinetic Parameter of Area Under the Curve From Zero to 6 Hours (AUC0-6) of PL3397 at Days 1 and 15 Following Twice Daily Administration of PL3397 at 1000 mg/Day in Participants With Unresectable or Advanced KIT-mutated Melanoma, Cycle 1, Day 1 and Day 15 at predose, 0.5 h, 1h, 2h, 4h, and 6h postdose|Summary of Pharmacokinetic Parameter of Time to Maximum Concentration and Last Measurable Time of PL3397 at Days 1 and 15 Following Twice Daily Administration of PL3397 at 1000 mg/Day in Participants With Unresectable or Advanced KIT-mutated Melanoma, Cycle 1, Day 1 and Day 15 at predose, 0.5 h, 1h, 2h, 4h, and 6h postdose|Summary of Pharmacokinetic Parameter of Accumulation Ratio of Day 15 to Day 1 for AUC0-6h (Robs) of PL3397 at Day 15 Following Twice Daily Administration of PL3397 at 1000 mg/Day in Participants With Unresectable or Advanced KIT-mutated Melanoma, Cycle 1, Day 1 and Day 15 at predose, 0.5 h, 1h, 2h, 4h, and 6h postdose|Summary of Pharmacokinetic Parameter of Accumulation Ratio of Day 15 to Day 1 for Cmax (Rcmax) of PL3397 at Day 15 Following Twice Daily Administration of PL3397 at 1000 mg/Day in Participants With Unresectable or Advanced KIT-mutated Melanoma, Cycle 1, Day 1 and Day 15 at predose, 0.5 h, 1h, 2h, 4h, and 6h postdose|Summary of Most Common (≥50% of Participants) Treatment-emergent Adverse Events Following Twice Daily Administration of PL3397 at 1000 mg/Day In Participants With Unresectable or Advanced KIT-mutated Melanoma, within 28 days after administration of the last dose of study drug, up to 18 months postdose|Summary of Treatment-emergent Adverse Events Grade ≥ 3 Following Twice Daily Administration of PL3397 at 1000 mg/Day In Participants With Unresectable or Advanced KIT-mutated Melanoma, Grade ≥ 3 was used to indicate moderate-to-severe treatment-emergent adverse events in which moderate was defined as discomfort enough to cause interference with normal daily activities and severe defined as the inability to perform normal daily activities., within 28 days after administration of the last dose of study drug, up to 18 months postdose|Summary of Most Common (≥50%) Drug-related Treatment-emergent Adverse Events Following Twice Daily Administration of PL3397 at 1000 mg/Day In Participants With Unresectable or Advanced KIT-mutated Melanoma, within 28 days after administration of the last dose of study drug, up to 18 months postdose|Summary of Drug-related Treatment-emergent Adverse Events Grade ≥ 3 Following Twice Daily Administration of PL3397 at 1000 mg/Day In Participants With Unresectable or Advanced KIT-mutated Melanoma, Grade ≥ 3 was used to indicate moderate-to-severe treatment-emergent adverse events in which moderate was defined as discomfort enough to cause interference with normal daily activities and severe defined as the inability to perform normal daily activities., within 28 days after administration of the last dose of study drug, up to 18 months postdose
