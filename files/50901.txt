Stem Cell Transplantation for Patients With Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of this study is to test whether regulatory T-cell reduction is possible and safe in myeloma subjects undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT).

Purity of ex vivo depleted regulatory T cells prior to autologous stem cell transplant (arm 3 only), Percentage of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells following ex vivo depletion in arm 3 will be analyzed by flow cytometry and compared to a pre-CD25-depletion sample. The depletion of CD25+ cells among the entire CD4+ population is expected to reach 80% efficiency., 1-3 days|Timing and duration of regulatory T cell depletion and recovery following autologous stem cell transplant, Timing and duration of regulatory T cell depletion and recovery following in vivo or ex vivo (arms 2 and 3) CD25+ T cell depletion will be performed at pre-defined timepoints prior to and following autologous stem cell transplant by flow cytometry on peripheral blood samples and directly compared to the percentages of regulatory T cells (CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ or CD4+CD25+CD127-) present at the same timepoints in patients enrolled onto arm 1 in which no regulatory T cell depletion is performed., 180 days|Incidence of autologous graft-versus-host disease following in vivo or ex vivo regulatory T cell depletion, The indicence of autologous graft-versus-host disease, as assessed by the development of skin rash, diarrhea and/or liver function test abnormalities consistent with autologous graft-versus-host disease following CD25+ T cell depletion and autologous stem cell transplant compared with the incidence of autologous graft-versus-host disease in patients enrolled onto arm 1 in which no regulatory T cell depletion is performed., 180 days
Kinetics of recovery of peripheral blood cellular elements, Time to recovery of neutrophils and platelets will be analyzed by daily complete blood counts following autologous stem cell transplant. Patients enrolled onto arms 2 and 3 (in vivo and ex vivo regulatory T cell depletion, respectively) will be directly compared to patients enrolled onto arm 1 in which no regulatory T cell depletion is performed., 180 days|Number of patients that experience a complete response following autologous stem cell transplant based upon the assigned study arm using International Myeloma Working Group definitions, The complete response rate following autologous stem cell transplant with or without regulatory T cell depletion will be analyzed and compared directly between study arms., 100 days
