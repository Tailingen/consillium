PReoperative Chemoradiation (Paclitaxel-carboplatin or FOLFOX) for Resectable Esophageal and Junctional Cancer
Resectable esophageal or junctional cancer requires medical treatment by radiotherapy and chemotherapy followed by surgery. Currently, one of the most commonly used chemotherapy treatment is the FOLFOX. It is a combination of three drugs administered intravenously: fluorouracil, oxaliplatin and folinic acid. This is the standard treatment.

Another protocol of chemotherapy is widely used by certain European and American teams, due to promising results : a combination of two drugs administered intravenously: Paclitaxel and Carboplatin (CarboP-pacliT). At present, no clinical study has shown the superiority of one treatment over the other.

The objective of this Phase II study is to clarify clinical practice by comparing these two chemotherapy treatments.

There is no standard preoperative (neoadjuvant) chemoradiation (NCRT) regimen for resectable esophageal cancer, because most if all trials failed to show any survival advantage favoring pCRT when compared to surgery only. This failure had been related to the lack of power of some trials, as well as the ability of chemoradiation to potentiate post-operative morbidity (including mortality), and therefore hampering the accrual of its own survival benefit. Hopefully, meta-analyses showed that NCRT increases survival when compared to surgery only. However, in the clinical practice, this does not make easier the choice of the best NCRT treatment. It appeared that the radiation regimen that were used in each randomized trials were heterogeneous with respect with dose, fraction, length of treatment, fields, dosimetry planning, and quality control. This applies also to chemotherapy with respect with the kind of cytotoxics that were used (including number of drugs), as well as dosage, and the number of cycles, although most of the time cytotoxics were fluorouracil and cisplatin.

Dutch colleagues recently showed that NCRT with weekly carboplatin and paclitaxel increase survival, without increasing postoperative mortality. Of note, most tumors in this trial arose from the lower third of the esophagus and esogastric junction and these habitually correlate with less postoperative morbidity compared to upper third tumors. Moreover, the lung volume spared from radiation was greater in junctional tumors than in upper third cancers - a critical point in the development of radiation-induced pneumonitis and subsequent postoperative mortality. It is difficult to understand how this taxane-based chemotherapy is active, as it did not make better that fluorouracil-based regimen in non-operable patients, and as NCRT with taxanes makes radiation-induced pneumonitis more likely. The favorable impact of this NCRT may lie on its radiation regimen. A moderate total dose of radiation, smaller radial margins than in other trials and modern dosimetry with 3D-planning all improve the safety of treatment and of subsequent surgery. Finally, the favorable impact of the Dutch NCRT regimen may lies on the fact that it does not include cisplatin, a compound which has been found related to the occurrence of more sudden deaths than a non cisplatin-based regimen such as the FOLFOX combination (fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, folinic acid) in the setting of definitive chemoradiotherapy.

Our aim is to evaluate the short-term benefit (complete resection rate) and safety (severe postoperative rate) of 2 preoperative regimen, (carboplatin-paclitaxel or fluorouracil-oxaliplatin-folinic acid), combined to the Dutch radiation backbone, in operable esophageal and junctional (Siewert I-II) cancer. The present trial offers the unique opportunity to compare two therapeutic strategies that have already been shown to be efficient in large randomized controlled trials offering level-1 evidence.
