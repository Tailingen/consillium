Cabazitaxel in Patients With Recurrent Ovarian Cancer After Failure of Standard Therapy.
Many ovarian cancer patients have been offered different standard cytostatics and gradually develop chemo-resistance. However, a considerable fraction of these patients are still in good general health and have a strong wish for further treatment.

Cabazitaxel (Jevtana®) is a new taxane with effect in breast and prostatic cancer. In both tumors it has shown effect in patients refractory to docetaxel. Therefore, it could be anticipated that cabazitaxel may also have an effect in chemo-resistant ovarian cancer.

The aim of the study is to investigate whether cabazitaxel could be a reasonable treatment option in patients with chemo-resistant and refractory ovarian cancer with regard to effect and toxicity.
