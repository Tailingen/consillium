Japanese Phase 1 Study of BMS-844203 (CT322)
The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of CT-322 monotherapy to determine the recommended dose for phase II and subsequent studies
Neoplasms
DRUG: BMS-844203 (CT-322)
Determine recommended dose for Phase 2 study of CT-322, Within the first 28 days
To assess the plasma pharmacokinetics of CT-322. Pharmacokinetics of CT-322 will be derived from plasma concentration versus time data. The pharmacokinetic parameters to be assessed include Cmax, Cmin, Tmax, AUC (INF), AUC (TAU), T-HALF, etc., Cycle 1: Day 1 to 5, 8, 15, 22 to 26 and 29|To assess the plasma pharmacokinetics of CT-322.
