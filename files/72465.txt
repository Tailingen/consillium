Abdominal Exploration Without Incisions
This study is being conducted to determine whether an endoscope, (a small, flexible tube with a camera mounted on the end) passed down through the throat, through the stomach, and into the abdomen can safely and accurately examine the organs and tissue of the abdomen and take biopsies if needed. We wish to determine if this endoscopic diagnostic route is as efficient as the laparoscopic diagnostic route, which is currently the standard of care.

PROCEDURE: Transgastric endoscopic peritoneoscopy.
1) That transgastric endoscopic peritoneoscopy is feasible., 4/12
That bacterial abdominal contamination is not clinically significant., 04/11
We propose to investigate the efficacy of transgastric endoscopic peritoneoscopy with endoscopic biopsy in patients undergoing diagnostic laparoscopy and who will require a concurrent gastrotomy for placement of a PEG, gastrojejunostomy or gastric resection.

We hypothesize that diagnostic endoscopic peritoneoscopy can be done safely with adequate visualization of the abdominal cavity to direct clinical treatment.
