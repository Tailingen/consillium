Does Recurrent Pancreatic Cancer Really Have Similar Outcome Compared With Primary Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer?
The recurrent pancreatic cancer (Rec-PC) after radical surgery is sometimes eligible to clinical trial of chemotherapy for unresectable pancreatic cancer. However, the difference between Rec-PC and primary metastatic pancreatic cancer (PM-PC) did not know well. Thus, whether Rec-PC and PM-PC should be included in the same category when conducting clinical trials evaluating chemotherapy remains controversial. The purpose of this study is to investigate the difference of overall survival (OS) between Rec-PC and PM-PC, and analyze their impact on prognosis.
Pancreatic Cancer Metastatic
DRUG: chemotherapy agents
Overall survival, From date of evaluation until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months
