Comparison of Different Methods of CAPTure of Circulating Tumour Cells (CTC) in Patients With Metastatic Breast or Prostate Cancer
This trial is a pilot, prospective, single-center study conducted in a population of patients with metastatic breast cancer (whatever the immunohistochemical subtype) or metastatic prostate cancer. The aim of this exploratory study is to compare the sensitivity of three different techniques (CellSearch®, Parsortix® and SmartCatch®) in detecting circulating tumor cells (CTCs). After the patient's agreement, and before starting anti-tumor treatment, a blood sample will be taken using the 3 different CTC detection techniques.

Each patient will participate in the study for one day.

A total of 36 evaluable patients (18 patients with metastatic breast cancer and 18 patients with metastatic prostate cancer) will be included in this interventional study.

OTHER: Taking blood samples before starting treatment
The rate of patients with at least one additional CTC detected by the SmartCatch® method compared with the standard approach (CellSearch®)., It is defined by the ratio of the number of patients with at least one additional CTC detected by the SmartCatch® method compared with the standard approach (CellSearch®) to the total number of patients., 9 months after the study start
The rate of patients with CTCs (CK+/CD45-) detected by each technique (CellSearch®, Parsortix® and SmartCatch®)., This is defined as the ratio of the number of patients with CTCs detected by the technique to the total number of patients., 9 months after the study start|The number of total CTCs (EpCAM+/CK+/CD45- and EpCAM-/CK+/CD45-) detected by the different techniques (CellSearch®, Parsortix® and SmartCatch®)., 9 months after the study start
