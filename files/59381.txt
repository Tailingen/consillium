Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation in Erlotinib/Gefitinib-responders With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) (RT1001)
RATIONALE: Radiation therapy to the brain may be effective in preventing brain metastases in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. It is not yet known whether radiation therapy is more effective than observation in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying radiation therapy to the brain to see how well it works compared with observation in preventing brain metastases in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
RADIATION: Prophylactic cranial irradiation|DRUG: Erlotinib /Gefitinib
The primary endpoint is the cumulative incidence of symptomatic brain metastases (BM), 2.5years
overall survival, baseline to date of death from any cause
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

Determine the effectiveness of prophylactic cranial radiotherapy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer that is responsive to gefitinib or erlotinib hydrochloride.

Secondary

Determine the progression-free survival in patients treated with this regimen. Determine the overall survival in patients treated with this regimen. Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients. Determine the psycho-neurological effects of this regimen in these patients. Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients with good response( CR/PR) to EGFR-TKI(Erlotinib or Gefitinib) are randomized to receive EGFR-TKI plus PCI or EGFR-TKI alone,stratified according to prior chemotherapy regimens (first line vs second line), and disease response status.

Group 1: Patients undergo prophylactic brain radiotherapy. Group 2: Patients undergo observation. Patients complete quality of life questionnaires periodically.

After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up periodically.
