Pilot hu14.18-IL2 in Resectable Recurrent Stage III or Stage IV Melanoma
Evaluate the antitumor activity of hu14.18-IL2 in the minimal residual disease setting. Evaluate the time to recurrence and overall survival of patients treated with hu14.18-IL2.
Melanoma
DRUG: hu14.18-IL2|DRUG: hu14.18-IL2
Ganglioside Expressed by Tumor Cells (GD2), Histological analysis of anti-tumor activity is a primary endpoint. This is measured after surgical resection via staining to indicate GD2 expression. The GD2 results were summarized in terms of positive (GD2 expression high or low/moderate) and negative (GD2 expression undetectable)., up to 1 week|Recurrence Free Survival (RFS), RFS was defined as the number of days from the day of evaluation following course 2 of immunocytokine treatment to the day the subject experienced an event of recurrence or death, whichever occurred first. Participants who did not experience an event of recurrence or death at the time of analysis were censored at the date of the last evaluation for recurrence., up to 24 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the number of days from randomization to the date of the participant's death. Participants who did not experience an event of death at the time of analysis were censored at the date of the last follow-up., up to 24 months
C-Reactive Protein (CRP), CRP measured at baseline, cycle 1 day 3, and cycle 2 day 1., up to 29 days|Lymphocyte Count, Lymphocyte count measured at baseline, cycle 1 day 3, cycle 1 day 8, and cycle 2 day 1, up to 29 days|Anti-Idiotypic Antibodies, Detection of anti-idiotypic will be performed on participants' serum obtained approximately 10 minutes prior to initiation of treatment, and serum samples on Days 3, 4, 8, and 29/1 of 3 cycles., up to 12 weeks|Anti-Fc-IL2 Antibodies, Detection of anti-FcIL2 will be performed on participants' serum obtained approximately 10 minutes prior to initiation of treatment, and serum samples on Days 3, 4, 8, and 29/1, for 3 cycles, up to 12 weeks|In Vitro Soluble Interleukin-2 (IL2) Receptor Alpha Levels, Soluble IL2 receptor Î± levels will be performed on participants approximately 10 minutes prior to initiation of treatment, and serum samples on Days 3, 4, 8, and 29/1., up to 12 weeks
Tumor Vascularity, Up to 1 week|Immunocytokine (IC) Binding, up to 1 week|Interferon Gamma (INF-y) Expression, Up to 1 week|T Cell Reactivity, Up to 1 week|Density of Cellular Infiltrate, Up to 1 week|Expression of GD2 Target Antigen, Up to 1 week|Natural Killer Cells (NK), NK and ADCC testing will be done on selected patients with freshly collected peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) at baseline (as a control), on day 8 of Courses 2 and 3, and on day 29/1 of Courses 2 and 3., up to 12 weeks|Antibody Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC), NK and ADCC testing will be done on selected patients with freshly collected peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) at baseline (as a control), on day 8 of Courses 2 and 3, and on day 29/1 of Courses 2 and 3., up to 12 weeks
