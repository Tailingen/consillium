The SAPPHO Study: Sequential Therapy With Curative Intent in de Novo HER2+ Metastatic Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to test the safety and effectiveness of a sequence of drugs (a Taxane plus Trastuzumab plus Pertuzumab followed by Trastuzumab Deruxtecan, followed by Tucatinib plus Ado-Trastuzumab Emtansine (T-DM1), followed by Trastuzumab plus Pertuzumab plus Tucatinib) in HER2+ Breast Cancer. The study will help investigators understand whether first intensifying therapy for a specific period and then stopping treatment is safe and effective for participants.

The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:

* Paclitaxel (a type of anti-microtubule agent)
* Docetaxel (a type of anti-microtubule agent)
* Nab-Paclitaxel (a type of anti-microtubule agent)
* Trastuzumab (a type of IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody)
* Pertuzumab (a type of monoclonal antibody)
* Trastuzumab Deruxtecan (a type of HER2-directed antibody drug conjugate)
* Tucatinib (Tyrosine Kinase HER2 Inhibitor)
* Ado-trastuzumab emtansine or T-DM1 (a type of HER2-targeted antibody-drug conjugate)

Disease Free Survival at 4 Years (DFS4), DFS4 is the probability estimate 4 years based on Kaplan-Meier Method. DFS is defined the time from registration to disease progression (including death from any cause) or resumption of anti-cancer therapy (not including endocrine therapy). Participants that are alive, progression free and off all anti-cancer therapy are censored at the date of their last disease evaluation., Up to 4 years
Median Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival based on the Kaplan-Meier method is defined as the time from randomization to death. Participants alive are censored at the last date of contact (including lost-to-follow-up) or at the date of withdrawal of consent, if relevant., Up to 5 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective response rate (ORR), defined as best overall response of either complete or partial response, will be assessed among participants who start protocol therapy and have measurable disease at screening. Radiographic response will be assessed using RECIST 1.1 criteria as defined in section 11.1. The objective response rate by RECIST 1.1 (CR + PR) will be reported with 95% exact confidence interval. ORR will be calculated as best cumulative response achieved with each Part of therapy, taking as baseline, the measurements taken prior to C1D1 of Part A of therapy, and as best cumulative response at the completion of Part D of therapy., Up to 54 months|Grade 3-5 Treatment-Related Toxicity Rate, The percentage of participants who experienced a maximum grade 3-5 treatment-related adverse event based on the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse events Version 5.0 (CTCAEv5) as reported on case report forms., Up to 54 months|Complete Rate of Each Treatment Part, Sequential therapy includes (A) taxane, trastuzumab, pertuzumab, (B) trastuzumab deruxtecan, (C) ado-trastuzumab emtansine, tucatinib, and (D) trastuzumab, pertuzumab, tucatinib. The proportion of participants who complete each part of therapy will be tabulated as the complete rate., Up to 54 months|Non-Completion reasons of each part of the sequential therapy, Sequential therapy includes (A) taxane, trastuzumab, pertuzumab, (B) trastuzumab deruxtecan, (C) ado-trastuzumab emtansine, tucatinib, and (D) trastuzumab, pertuzumab, tucatinib. The reasons of non-completion will be tabulated., Up to 54 months|DFS4 by Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) status, DFS4 is defined as primary outcome 1. Participants will be categorized by MRD status (detectable nv non-detectable)., Up to 4 years
This is an open-label phase II single-arm study to test the efficacy of a regimen of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeted study drugs in participants with HER2-Positive metastatic Breast Cancer (HER2+ MBC).

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved all the study drugs as a treatment option for metastatic, HER2+ breast cancer. In this study, investigators are planning to give a series of treatments in a row without waiting for disease worsening and then stopping HER2 treatment.

The research study procedures include screening for eligibility, study treatment visits, blood tests, tumor biopsies, questionnaires, Computed Tomography (CT) scans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans, echocardiograms, and electrocardiograms.

Participation in this research study is expected to last about 93 weeks (12 weeks for Part A, 18 weeks for Part B, 12 weeks for Part C, and 51 weeks for Part D) for study treatment and approximately three months to ten years for follow up.

It is expected that about 72 people will take part in this research study.
