Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) in Newly Diagnosed Advanced Staged Lung Adenocarcinoma (Sindas)
To tested if the adding of consolidative SBRT to TKI in EGFR mutated patients with less than or equal to 5 metastatic sites (primary + 5) will improve progression free survival (PFS) compared to TKI alone.
Stage IV EGFR Mutated Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
RADIATION: Radiation: SBRT|DRUG: TKI (Gefitinib or Tarceva )
Progression free survival, Evaluate the effect of TKI with or without SBRT on progression free survival,to describe local control and out-of-field disease progression, 4 years
Overall survival, To evaluate overall survival after SBRT followed by maintenance chemotherapy in comparison to maintenance chemotherapy alone., 4 years|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability]), Using CTCAE system to evaluate toxicity profile, 4 years
This protocol is a randomized phase III trial of TKI versus consolidative Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) plus TKI for patients with Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Prior to accrual on the trial, patients with Stage IV NSCLC will be tested with positive EGFR mutation. Patients who with fewer than or equal to 5 sites of oligometastatic disease will be randomized toTKI or consolidative SBRT to all sites of disease (followed by TKI at the medical oncologist's discretion). Choices of TKI will be determined by the medical oncologist based on clinical appropriateness.
