Study of the Effect on Non-small Cell Lung Cancer of the Investigational Drug Motexafin Gadolinium When Used in Combination With Docetaxel (Taxotere)
The purpose of this study is to determine if the addition of motexafin gadolinium (study drug) to standard treatment with docetaxel will improve the response rate in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.
Lung Cancer
DRUG: Motexafin Gadolinium
To assess the complete and partial response rate (CR and PR) in patients with advanced NSCLC when administered motexafin gadolinium (MGd) and docetaxel, The patient population for the primary endpoint is all patients who underwent at least 1 cycle of treatment and at 1 response evaluation., up to 12 cycles
To estimate the time of progression, The progression is defined as the time fromfirst does of MGd to first eviedence of progression, up to 12 cycles|To estimate overall survival, The patient population for this endpoint is all patients who received at least 1 dose of MGd and docetaxel, up to 12 cycles|To estimate progression-free survival, Progression-free survival is defined as the time from first does of MGd to the earlier of progression, up to 12 cycles|To estimate duration of response (CR + PR), Duration of response (CR +PR) is defined as the time from the fisrt response to the time of disease progression., Up to 12 cycles|To estimate clinical benefit rate (CR + PR + stable disease [SD]), The patient population for this endpoint is all patients who underwent at least 2 cycles of treatment and at least 1 response evaluation, up to 12 cycles|To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination of MGd and docetaxel in advanced NSCLC, All patients who receive at one dose of MGd will be included in the safety summaries and analyses, Up to 12 cycles
Preclinical and clinical data suggest that MGd has activity in NSCLC and that the combination of MGd and docetaxel may be more effective that docetaxel alone. In this trial, patients will receive 10 mg/kg MGd followed by 75 mg/m2 once every 3 weeks. This dosing regimen was well tolerated in the Phase I dose escalation trial. A Simon 2-stage trial design will be used; if at least 4 out of 39 evaluable patients in the first stage of the trial demonstrate objective clinical response, the study will proceed to Stage 2, where an additional 22 evaluable patients will be enrolled following the same treatment regimen and assessment schedule as in Stage 1. Patients with stable disease, CR, or PR will continue dosing up to 12 cycles and will be followed for response every 6 weeks until PD, death, or end of study.
