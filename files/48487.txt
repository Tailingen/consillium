Patient Outcomes from Second Film-readers and Test Threshold Relaxation in Breast Screening
Analysis of women's medical records to understand the impact of previous changes to breast cancer screening (increase from one to two clinicians examining each woman's mammograms, and what proportion of women they recall for further tests)

Number of women overdiagnosed (the cancer would not have become symptomatic within the woman's lifetime) using compensatory drop method, Overdiagnosis of breast cancer (measured as difference in total cancer incidence, screen and symptomatic). Will also report mechanism of action (number of screen detected cancers, number of symptomatically detected cancers at 3,13, and 30 years follow-up), 13 years, and up to 30 years|Cancers detected at screening, Biopsy proven cancers detected at screening, 1 day screening episode|False positive recalls, Recall of women for further tests after screening which did not result in detection of cancer, 1 day screening episode|Breast cancer mortality, Mortality due to breast cancer (dependent on securing follow-on funding), 13 years, and up to 30 years|All cause mortality, Mortality due to any cause (dependent on securing follow on funding), 13 years, and up to 30 years|Characteristics of cancer detected, Size, grade and stage (reported overall, screen detected, and symptomatic detected)., 1 day screening episode, 3year, 13 year and up to 30 year follow up
Breast cancer morbidity, Treatment received as a proxy for treatment associated morbidity (reported overall, screen detected and symptomatically detected, if follow on funding obtained), Up to 30 years|Breast cancer free survival, Survival without a diagnosis of breast cancer, Up to 30 years follow-up
Retrospective observational study examining the records and outcomes of women who attended breast cancer screening between 1988 and 2016. Linkage of records from the breast screening service, the cancer registry, and mortality. Analysis of whether changing the threshold for whether to recall women for further tests or the number of clinicians examining the mammograms for signs of cancer affects outcomes.
