MSC2015103B in Solid Tumors
The main purpose of this study is to test the experimental drug, MSC2015103B at different dose levels and on different treatment schedules, to see whether it is safe and can be tolerated when given to subjects once a day one day per week over a 21-day period or once a day three times per week over a 21-day period. The investigators would also like to find out how MSC2015103B is broken down by the body.

Additional purposes of the trial are to assess side effects of MSC2015103B and to find out whether MSC2015103B has anti-cancer effects. In addition, the investigators would like to explore pharmacokinetics.
