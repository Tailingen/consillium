Epidemiological Study on Malignancy Complicated With Renal Injury
The epidemiological study of tumor complicated with kidney disease can clarify the prevalence and risk factors of renal injury when malignant tumor is diagnosed, and understand the impact of malignant tumor complicated with renal injury on survival time. This study will bring enlightenment to clinicians, discover high-risk factors in time, and try to avoid renal damage factors in diagnosis and treatment. Early diagnosis and early treatment can partially terminate the progress of renal injury, avoid the suspension of treatment due to renal reasons, and avoid the occurrence of end-stage renal failure (ESRD).
Kidney Injury
survival, survival time, 3 years
1. To determine the prevalence of malignant tumor complicated with renal injury and analyze the related risk factors.
2. To compare the survival time of malignant tumor with or without renal injury
