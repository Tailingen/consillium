The aim of this study is to evaluate bendamustine, gemcitabine and vinorelbine (BeGEV) scheme efficacy as induction therapy to high dose chemotherapy with Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem-Cell Transplantation (AHSCT) for patients with relapsed/refractory Hodglin's Lymphoma (HL).

Four BeGEV courses repeated every 3 weeks in the absence of any reasons listed in the paragraph 7.5; whenever an objective response is observed at disease evaluation performed after IV cycle patients undergo to high dose chemotherapy with AHSCT (conditioning regimens based on preference of each Centre).
