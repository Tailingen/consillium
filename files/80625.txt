[90Y]Y-PTT Endoradiotherapy in CNS Lymphoma Patients
This will be an open-label, single-arm, national phase 1/2 therapeutic study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of \[90Y\]Y-PentixaTher (\[90Y\]Y-PTT) for the treatment of recurrent or refractory primary or isolated secondary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma.

The study will be performed in three cohorts with different dose levels according to the best-of-5 dose escalation design. A safety review committee (SRC) will evaluate dose-limiting toxicities and decide about escalation and de-escalation.

Eligible patients will receive one cycle of \[90Y\]Y-PTT, which will be administered intravenously. There will be no comparator in this study.

Safety, biodistribution, dosimetry and efficacy will be evaluated during the core study phase (Visit 1 until Visit 5). Thereafter three follow-up (FU) visits will take place, at three-months intervals to evaluate the extent of disease.

DRUG: [90Y]Y-PentixaTher
Incidence, severity and relationship of (S)AEs (graded in severity according to NCI CTCAE version 5.0), Incidence, severity and relationship of (/serious) adverse events (S)AEs will be analyzed by descriptive statistical methods. The analyses will be based on the safety analysis set (SAF).

AEs as well as SAEs will be tabulated. Verbatim terms will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), and tabulations will occur by System Organ Class and Preferred Term. Severity will be graded and tabulated according to NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. Treatment-emergent AEs will be the focus of the analyses. AEs and SAEs assessed as causality related to IMP by the investigator, and AEs leading to death will be tabulated separately., From screening until including the last follow-up visit. SAEs occuring after the end of the study should only be reported to Pentixapharm if the Investigator considers there is a causal relationship with the study drug.
