Docetaxel is and an effective cytotoxic agent in \> 1st line treatment of advanced or metastatic non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Recently, a phase III study of 1st line treatment in patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC showed that the addition of bevacizumab to a platinum-based regimen provided a survival benefit. There are patients with NSCLC who have not received bevacizumab and have relapsed after 1st and/or 2nd line therapy. The evaluation of bevacizumab plus chemotherapy in such patients is justified. This study will evaluate the combination of docetaxel and bevacizumab as 2nd or 3rd line treatment of NSCLC.
