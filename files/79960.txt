CD30 CAR for CD30+ NSGCT
This is a phase 2 research study that enrolls adult subjects with Nonseminomatous Germ Cell Tumors (NSGCT). The purpose of this study is to create a repository and explore the presence of modified T cells in the subject's plasma or tumors.

This study collects biospecimens (such as tumor tissue, blood, and modified T cells) that can be used in future research studies. The collected specimens can help to examine whether the modified T cells are present in the body and tumor. If the modified T cells are present in the body, and how long they last. They also will use the specimen to identify ways to improve treatment options for a future cancer patient.

Research with blood, tissue, or body fluids (specimens) can help researchers understand how the human body works. Sometimes researchers collect and store specimens and use them for different kinds of research or share them with other scientists; this is called a specimen repository or "biobank." Research with biospecimens might help to introduce new tests to find diseases or new ways to treat diseases.

The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way seems perfect for fighting cancer. This research study combines two different ways of fighting disease: antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are proteins that protect the body from disease caused by bacteria or toxic substances. Antibodies work by binding those bacteria or substances, which stops them from growing and causing bad effects. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including tumor cells or cells that are infected. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers. They both have shown promise, but neither alone has been sufficient to cure most patients. This study is designed to combine both T cells and antibodies to create a more effective treatment called autologous T lymphocyte chimeric antigen receptor cells targeted against the CD30 antigen (ATLCAR.CD30) administration.

Prior trials have shown the safety of ATLCAR.CD30 product was administered to subjects with lymphomas. This study was planned based on the safety and efficacy data from previous studies (NCT02690545 and NCT02917083).

The Overall response rate (ORR)- Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST), ORR - RECIST will be assessed per RECIST v1.1. criteria which define Complete Response (CR) as the disappearance of all target lesions, pathological lymph node (LN) \<10mm, and normalization of serum tumor markers; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions serum tumor markers (AFP and β-hCG) should be stable or decreasing. ; and Overall Response Rate (ORR) = CR + PR/total number of subjects., 6 weeks
The Overall response rate (ORR)- Per immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria (irRECIST), ORR -irRECIST will be assessed per irRECIST criteria which defines complete response (irCR), the disappearance of all lesions, no new lesions, lymph nodes \< 10 mm in short axis; partial response (irPR), ≥30% decrease in the sum of target lesions and non-target lesions are irNN; Stable response (irSD), not meeting criteria for irCR, irPR, or irPD; Progressive Disease (irPD), ≥20% increase in tumor burden and minimum 5 mm absolute increase in compared to nadir; for no new non-target or (irNN) and where irPR or irPD are confirmed by a repeat, consecutive assessment., Up to 6 weeks|The best overall response rate (BORR), BORR will be defined as the best response recorded after the administration of the cell therapy to the date of disease progression per modified RECIST 1.1, or death as a result of any cause., Up to 6 weeks|Progression free survival (PFS), PFS will be defined per modified RECIST 1.1 criteria. PFS is defined from the day of ATLCAR.CD30 infusion to relapse (in patients with a documented complete response at the time of cell infusion) or progression (in patients without a complete response at the time of cell infusion), or death as a result of any cause per modified RECIST 1.1 criteria classification., Up to12 weeks|Median Progression free survival (PFS), Median PFS is defined from the day of initial lymphodepletion administration of the first ATLCAR.CD30 product infusion to the date of disease progression per modified RECIST 1.1 criteria or death as a result of any cause., Up to12 weeks|Duration of response (DOR), DOR will be defined as the time from documentation of PR or better to PD as defined by modified RECIST 1.1 criteria. Progressive Disease (PD) - At least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of the target lesions, a relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5mm or the appearance of one or more new lesion or unequivocal progression of non-target or non-measurable lesions (e.g. worsening bone pain requiring radiation or significant increase in pain medications) or increase ≥ 50% in AFP or β-hCG., Up to12 weeks|The percentage of improvement, The percentage of subjects who have an improvement in their response per modified RECIST 1.1., Up to 12 weeks|Adverse Events CTCAE, Adverse Events CTCAE will be classified and graded according to the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0.

A grading (severity) scale is provided for each AE term. Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated. Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL). Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-care ADL. Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. Grade 5 Death related to AE., Up to 6 weeks|Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) will be graded according to the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) CRS Consensus Grading.
