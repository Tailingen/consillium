Anti-Angiogenesis Therapy Using Thalidomide in Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of this research is to study how helpful thalidomide is in controlling the myeloma disease and to study any side effect resulting from thalidomide.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Thalidomide
To determine tumor response, overall and progression free survival following thalidomide therapy in patients with multiple myeloma
To determine toxicities associated with thalidomide in patients with multiple myeloma
Patients will receive thalidomide in the oral form (by mouth). Then the dose of thalidomide will be increased each week until week 7 as long as there are no significant side effects. After week 7, patients will continue to receive thalidomide as long as there is no toxicity requiring the treatment to be stopped and as long as there is no evidence of rapid tumor growth during the treatment with thalidomide.

Routine physical examinations and blood tests will be done to monitor the effect of treatment and the toxicities encountered, if any, and provide the available treatments for side effects accordingly. Blood tests will be done once a month for the first six months of receiving thalidomide.
