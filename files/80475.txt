Doxorubicin HCI Liposome Injection Versus Weekly Docetaxel in Patients First Relapse Metastatic Breast Cancer
The efficacy of single agent liposomal doxorubicin as compared to single agent docetaxel will be evaluated as first line treatment in metastatic breast cancer patients, with subsequent crossover to the opposite arm at disease progression or patient intolerance. We will explore this as well as any possible cross resistance between these two agents.

DRUG: Liposomal Doxorubicin|DRUG: Docetaxel
Overall Response Rate (ORR), the Percentage of Patients Who Experience an Objective Benefit From Treatment, ORR is defined as the percentage of patients who exhibit a Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR). Complete Response is the total disappearance of clinically and radiologically detectable disease for at least 4 weeks. Partial Response is at least a 50% reduction of all measurable lesions as measured by the product of the perpendicular diameters of the greatest dimensions of tumor size, with no new lesions appearing for at least four weeks., 18 Months
Progression Free Survival (PFS), the Length of Time, in Months, That Patients Were Alive From Their First Date of Protocol Treatment Until Worsening of Their Disease., PFS was defined as the interval from first study treatment until the date that the first progression of breast cancer was documented, or death occurred., 18 Months
Upon determination of eligibility, patients will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms:

* Liposomal Doxorubicin
* Docetaxel

For ever 2 patients treated, 1 will receive treatment A (Liposomal Doxorubicin) and 1 will receive treatment B (Docetaxel). Patients demonstrating progression on either ARM will be eligible for cross over to treatment in the other ARM, provided patient still meets the eligibility laboratory and performance status criteria. The study is not blinded so both the patient and the doctor will know which treatment has been assigned.
