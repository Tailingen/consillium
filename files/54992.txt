Study Evaluating Neratinib Plus Paclitaxel VS Trastuzumab Plus Paclitaxel In ErbB-2 Positive Advanced Breast Cancer
This study is investigating the effects of an experimental drug (neratinib) in combination with paclitaxel versus trastuzumab in combination with paclitaxel for the treatment of women who have not received previous treatment for erbB-2-positive locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. The study will compare the effectiveness of each regimen in shrinking tumors and extending the lives of women with erbB-2 (HER2) positive breast cancer. The study will also compare the safety of the two regimens and as well as the quality of life of subjects receiving either regimen.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Neratinib|DRUG: Trastuzumab|DRUG: Paclitaxel
Progression-Free Survival, Defined as the interval from the date of randomization until the first date on which recurrence or progression, or death due to any cause, is documented, censored at the last assessable evaluation or at the initiation of new anticancer therapy., From randomization to disease progression or death, assessed up to 5.3 years
Objective Response Rate, Defined as the percentage of subjects who achieved confirmed tumor response (complete or partial response) per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST) v1.0: Complete Response (CR), disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; and Non-Progressive Disease for non-target lesions, and no new lesions., From randomization to disease progression or last tumor assessment, assessed up to 5.3 years|Duration of Response, Measured from the time at which measurement criteria were first met for CR or PR (whichever status was recorded first), until the date of first recurrence, disease progression (PD), or death was objectively documented, taking as a reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded since enrollment, per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST) v1.0: Complete Response (CR), disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; and Non-PD for non-target lesions, and no new lesions., From first response to first PD or death, assessed up to 5.3 years after first subject randomized|Clinical Benefit Rate, Defined as the proportion of patients who achieved overall tumor response (CR or PR) or SD for at least 24 weeks per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST) v1.0: Complete Response (CR), disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; and Non-PD for non-target lesions, and no new lesions; Stable Disease (SD), Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study., From randomization to disease progression or death, assessed up to 5.3 years|Symptomatic or Progressive Central Nervous System (CNS) Lesions, Defined as the time interval from the date of randomization until the first date of CNS symptoms, the imaging examination shows CNS progression or is censored at the last assessable evaluation on study or prior to new anti-cancer therapy, if applicable.

If median time to Symptomatic or Progressive CNS Lesions is not estimable, cumulative incidence will be reported instead., From randomization to disease progression PD or last tumor assessment, assessed up to 5.3 years
