Biobanking and New Biomolecular Metrics
The goal of this Interventional study aims to apply, in our Institutes, a 4p oncological model i.e. predictive, personalized, of precision and participated (Regina Elena and San Gallicano).
Melanoma (Skin)|Liquid Biopsy

Oncology target therapy, Integration between molecular diagnostic and melanoma histopathology: correlation between mutational miRNA/ncRNA profiles and pathological staging parameters., 12 months|Oncology target therapy, Correlation between molecular diagnostic and imaging non-invasive instrumental diagnostic, 12 months|Oncology target therapy, Correlation between molecular diagnostic and dermatologic clinical diagnostic; integration of liquid biopsy during oncologic ambulatorial follow-up; lead time of relapse., 12 months|Oncology target therapy, Complement to surgery, 12 months
Patients will be recruited with an innovative and systematic scheme: collection and biobanking of biological materials (tissue biopsy, re-biopsy and liquid biopsy) followed by a molecular monitoring thanks to genomic and epigenomic methods. It's an open-ended study. In particular we will try to identify new "actionable" signatures and we will try to insert the patients to innovative clinical trials, thanks to the evaluation of all cases with a Molecular Tumor Board.

The main objectives are:

* Introduce a new methodology to improve and integrate the already existent institutional PDTA
* Evaluate and measure the applicative value
* Establish a biostatistical platform
