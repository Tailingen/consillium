Prevalence and Impact of Fatigue in Myasthenic Patients Followed At Clermont-Ferrand University Hospital - "My" Asthenia
After identifying myasthenic patients meeting the inclusion criteria, telephone contact with patients to suggest that they participate in the study by responding to various questionnaires composed of validated scales used in current practice (MG-ADL, MG-QoL-15, MFIS, FSS, PASS, HADS, Godin-Leisure Exercise Time) which will be completed either digitally (REDCap link) or by paper form if necessary. Consultation of patients' medical records to collect information relating to factors associated with fatigue or intrinsic illness (demographic data, comorbidities, progression of the illness, treatments, etc.).

As part of their usual care, myasthenia patients answer questionnaires according to the following procedure :

1. Mailing of questionnaires to all eligible patients before their consultation The questionnaires are composed of scales validated and used in current practice (MG-ADL, MG-QoL-15, MFIS, FSS, PASS, HADS, Godin-Leisure Exercise Time).
2. Collection of questionnaires When patients come for consultation, the completed questionnaires are collected by the medical team.
3. Collection of questionnaires The responses to the questionnaires and the scores and results obtained from these questionnaires are integrated into the patients' medical records.

As part of our study and in parallel with the patient's clinical follow-up, data relating to factors associated with fatigue or intrinsic illness (demographic data, comorbidities, progression of the disease, treatments, etc.) as well as responses to questionnaires will be collected.
