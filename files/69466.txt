A Multicenter, Randomized, Open, Phase III Trial of ddEC-THPvs Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of TCHP Neoadjuvant Therapy for HER2-positive Breast Cancer
The study is being conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of anthracycline-containing ddEC-THP intensive regimen and an anthracycline-free TCbHP neoadjuvant therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer
HER-2 Positive Breast Cancer
DRUG: TCbHP VS ddEC-THP
pCR rate using the definition of ypT0/Tis ypN0 (i.e., no invasive residual in breast or nodes; noninvasive breast residuals allowed) at the time of definitive surgery, pCR rate (ypT0/is，ypN0) is defined as the percentage of participants without residual invasive tumor on hematoxylin and eosin evaluation of breast specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes following completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy by current AJCC staging criteria assessed by the local pathologist at the time of definitive surgery in all participants., Up to approximately 24 weeks
Event-Free Survival (EFS), EFS is defined as the time from start of study treatment to any of the following events: progression of disease that precludes surgery, local or distant recurrence, second primary malignancy (breast or other cancers) or death due to any cause., Up to approximately 3 years|Invasive Disease-Free Survival (iDFS), iDFS events are defined as follows: (1)Ipsilateral invasive breast tumor recurrence. (2) Ipsilateral local-regional invasive breast cancer recurrence. (3) Ipsilateral second primary invasive breast cancer. (4) Contralateral invasive breast cancer. (5) Distant recurrence. (6) Death attributable to any cause., Up to approximately 3 years|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. Participants without documented death at the time of the analysis will be censored at the date of the last follow-up., Up to approximately 3 years
A Multicenter, Randomized, Open, Phase III，The study is being conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of anthracycline-containing ddEC-THP intensive regimen and an anthracycline-free TCbHP neoadjuvant therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer,Subjects will be treated until disease progression, toxicity is intolerable, informed consent is withdrawn, and investigators determine that medication must be discontinued. Drug efficacy and safety data will be collected.
