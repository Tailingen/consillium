Clinical Trial of SIBP-03 in Patients With Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
This phase II study will be conducted in two parts (Ⅱa and Ⅱb), with a 21-day treatment cycle until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of informed consent, death, initiation of new anti-tumor treatment or loss of follow-up.
Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: HER3 Monoclonal antibodies-Dose A|DRUG: HER3 Monoclonal antibodies-Dose B|DRUG: HER3 Monoclonal antibodies-Dose C|OTHER: HER3 Monoclonal antibodies-Dose D|OTHER: Placebo|COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Cetuximab injection
The occurrence of any adverse events (AE), All subjects after receiving the investigational drug were observed during the trial for any AE that occurred during the clinical study.AE were manifested as symptoms, signs, diseases, or abnormal laboratory tests, but may not necessarily have a causal relationship with the investigational drug., 30 days after the last dose|SAE (Serious Adverse Events), That is serious adverse events, any serious adverse events that occurred to the subject during the study period., 30 days after the last dose|Cmax (Peak Plasma Concentration), It shows the highest plasma concentration of a drug that can be achieved after administration., 30 days after the last dose|Tmax(Peak Time), That is peak time of drug action, it shows the time required to reach the maximum concentration on the subject plasma concentration curve after administration., 30 days after the last dose|T ½(Terminal elimination half-life), It reflects how quickly the drug is eliminated from the body., 30 days after the last dose|CL(Clearance Rate), Apparent volume of drug distribution removed from the body per unit time., 30 days after the last dose|Difference of ORR, Differences in ORR between SIBP-03 and placebo evaluated by the Independent Evaluation Committee (IRC) according to RECIST 1.1. Only applicable to part two., The 1 day the test results reported after the last dose
ORR (Objective Response Rate), The proportion of subjects whose tumor volume shrinks to a predetermined value and maintains the minimum time limit, and is the sum of complete and partial responses., The 1 day the test results reported after the last dose|DCR (Disease control rate), In clinical trials, the percentage of subjects with advanced or metastatic cancer who responded fully to cancer treatment, partially responded, and had stable disease., The 1 day the test results reported after the last dose|PFS (Progression-free survival), The time between the onset of randomization and the onset (of any aspect) of tumor progression or death (from any cause)., The 1 day the test results reported after the last dose|ADA (Anti-drug Antibody), The incidence of anti-drug antibody., The 1 day the test results reported after the last dose|NAb (Neutralizing Antibody), The incidence of neutralizing antibody., The 1 day the test results reported after the last dose
This phase II study will be conducted in two parts (Ⅱa and Ⅱb), with a 21-day treatment cycle until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of informed consent, death, initiation of new anti-tumor treatment or loss of follow-up. The participants in both study parts are the same, both of whom were patients with recurrent/metastatic advanced HNSCC (non nasopharyngeal carcinoma).

* a is an open-label study. Part one, 12 subjects were randomly assigned 1:1 to two groups and treated with SIBP-03 dose A or dose B every 3 weeks (Q3W) combined with cetuximab every week (QW). Part two, 3 subjects were treated with SIBP-03 dose C Q3W combined with cetuximab QW. If 1/3 subjects (1 case) have DLT, 3 more subjects need to continue to observe the safety and tolerance; If DLT occurs in 3 cases or ≥ 2 cases in 6 cases, the sponsor and the researcher will discuss and decide whether to terminate this part of the study or change the dose. 12 subjects were added at most.
* b is a randomized, double-blind study. Including an experimental group (RP2D) and a placebo control group. The qualified subjects in this stage will be randomly assigned according to the ratio of 2: 1, including 38 cases in the experimental group and 19 cases in the control group, with a total of 57 subjects.
