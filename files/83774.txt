Sequential Treatment of Cabozantinib for Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn about the effects of a higher dose of ncabozantinib in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma who have progressed on or after receiving cabozantinib treatment.
RCC|Renal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Cabozantinib 80 MG
Progression free survival of cabozantinib, Progression free survival (PFS) will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v 1.1), From time of enrollment/treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, or discontinuation from the study treatment for any other reason up to 24 months
Objective Response Rate of cabozantinib, To determine the Objective Response Rate (including stable disease/partial response/complete response) of of cabozantinib or cabozantinib-nivolumab combination assessed by RECIST (version 1.1), Follow up until disease progression, up to 24 months.|Disease Control Rate of of cabozantinib, To determine the disease control rate (including stable disease/partial response/complete response) of of cabozantinib or cabozantinib-nivolumab combination assessed by RECIST (version 1.1), Follow up until disease progression, up to 24 months.|Duration of response of of cabozantinib, To determine the duration of response of of cabozantinib or cabozantinib-nivolumab combination compared to historical controls assessed by RECIST (version 1.1), Follow up until disease progression, up to 24 months.|Overall survival of of cabozantinib, To determine the overall survival rate of response of of cabozantinib or cabozantinib-nivolumab combination compared to historical controls assessed by RECIST (version 1.1), Follow up until death or withdrawal, up to 36 months.
This is a multi-center, open-label, single cohort, phase II study to assess the efficacy of cabozantinib dose escalation at the time of progression on/after cabozantinib monotherapy. The study will enroll subjects with advanced RCC (defined as locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic) who have disease progression on/after cabozantinib monotherapy in any line of treatment
