Trans-parenchymal Compressing Suture in Major Liver Resection
Non-anatomical liver resection with appropriate resection margin was regarded as a potential curative treatment for selected major hepatic carcinoma due to preserving maximal normal liver, especially in cirrhotic patients. But occurrence of cutting surface related complications become a main challenge.
Liver Carcinoma Resectable
PROCEDURE: TCS
Cutting surface related complications, After liver resection, some complication related cutting surface may occur, including surgery site infection, bile leakage, bleeding., 90 days
Interventions for cutting surface related complications, Once the cutting surface related complications occur, some interventions need to be performed to treat these complications, such as percutaneous abdominal paracentesis or reoperation., 90 days
In order to better manage the cutting surface after liver resection, we further applied trans-parenchymal compressing suture to "not good" cutting surface in hope of decreasing cutting surface related complication. A majority of studies investigating cutting surface management are limited to non-surgical treatments, such as the application of hemostasis agents including fibrin sealants, oxidized cellulose, and absorbable gelatin sponge13-15 . But there is no consensus regarding the necessity of the hemostatic agent application to the liver cutting surface. Up to date, few studies investigate surgical suture management of the cutting surface in liver resection.
