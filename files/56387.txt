A Study Comparing Ensatinib Versus Platinum-Based Chemotherapy as Adjuvant Treatment for Stage II-IIIA ALK -Positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This randomized, active-controlled, multicenter, open-label, Phase II study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ensatinib compared with Platinum-Based Chemotherapy as adjuvant treatment in ALK fusion positive II-IIIA stage non-small cell lung cancer after surgical resection
ALK Fusion Protein Expression|Adjuvant Therapy|Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Ensatinib|DRUG: chemotherapy
Disease free survival (DFS), From date of randomization until date of the first observation of tumor recurrence, metastasis (based on imaging ) or death, up to approximately 5 years.
DFS at 2 years, Assessed at 2 years|DFS at 3 years, Assessed at 3 years|Overall survival (OS), The time from the date of randomization to death from any cause, up to approximately 7 years|OS rate at 5 years, Assessed at 5 years
Participants in the experimental arm will receive Ensatinib at 225 mg orally once a day (QD) taken with food for 2 years. Participants in the control arm will receive one of the protocol specified platinum based chemotherapy regimens for 4 cycles. Treatments will continue until disease recurrence, meeting one of treatment discontinuation criteria (eg, patient decision, adverse event, pregnancy), or achieving a maximum treatment duration of 2 years. At the time of disease recurrence, participants will enter a survival follow-up until death, withdrawal of consent or study closure, whichever occurs earlier.
