Understanding the Burden of ACC Through the Eyes of Patients
This is a comprehensive, cross-sectional study conducted with approximately 40-60 individuals affected by ACC who may know the results of molecular profiling of their tumor.

Primary Objectives:

* To identify the specific burdens faced by patients with ACC
* To compare/contrast the burdens faced by patients with ACC at different disease stages (no evident disease, metastatic disease/watchful waiting, progressive disease)
Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma
Key burdens related to the disease or treatments, Q4-2021|Life impacts of those burdens for patient/family, Q4-2021
This is a comprehensive, cross-sectional study conducted with approximately 40-60 individuals affected by ACC who may know the results of molecular profiling of their tumor.

Primary Objectives:

* To identify the specific burdens faced by patients with ACC
* To compare/contrast the burdens faced by patients with ACC at different disease stages (no evident disease, metastatic disease/watchful waiting, progressive disease)

Secondary Objectives:

* To assess QoL implication in patients living with ACC (Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma)
* To compare the burdens and QoL impacts in people living with ACC, with their tumors bearing Notch mutations or Notch Wild Type due to:

  * Rate of disease progression
  * Location of Metastases
