Phase 3 Study of Zandelisib (ME-401) in Combination With Rituximab in Patients With iNHL - (COASTAL)
This is a Phase 3 study of the PI3KÎ´ inhibitor Zandelisib (ME-401) in combination with rituximab, in comparison to standard immunochemotherapy (Rituximab-Bendamustine or Rituximab-CHOP) in subjects with relapsed or refractory FL and MZL.

DRUG: Zandelisib|DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Bendamustine|DRUG: CHOP
Progression Free Survival, PFS is defined as the time from randomization date until the date of disease progression, or death from any cause, 1 year 7 months
Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects who have a best overall response of CR or PR according to the Lugano Classification over the entire duration of the study, including the efficacy follow-up period., 1 year 7 months|Complete Response Rate (CRR), CRR is defined as the proportion of subjects who have a best overall response of CR during the study (i.e., up to time of analysis of PFS)., 1 year 7 months|Overall Survival, OS is defined as the time (in days) from randomization until death from any cause. For subjects alive at the time of analysis, they will be censored at the last documented alive date., 1 year 7 months|Number of Treatment Emergent AEs (Zandelisib When Combined With Rituximab), Measured by the number of Treatment Emergent AEs, 1 year 7 months|Number of SAEs (Zandelisib When Combined With Rituximab), Measured by the number of SAEs, 1 year 7 months|Number of Lab Abnormalities (Zandelisib When Combined With Rituximab), Measured by the number of laboratory abnormalities, 1 year 7 months
This is an open label, randomized, two-arm Phase 3 study in subjects with relapsed or refractory FL and MZL to evaluate efficacy and safety of zandelisib in combination with rituximab in comparison to standard immunochemotherapy (Rituximab-Bendamustine or Rituximab-CHOP).

Subjects must have relapsed after at least one previous line of systemic immunochemotherapy. Previous treatments must have included an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) with chemotherapy such as Bendamustine (B), CHOP, CVP, FND, or similar regimens, or an anti-CD20 mAb with Lenalidomide (L).

Approximately 534 randomized subjects will be enrolled in this study.
