OTHER: Cryotherapy|OTHER: laser
cure rate, Warts was considered cured if they was no longer visible and could not be palpated anymore by hand. Assessment of whether or not cured was performed on site by a senior dermatologist, Cure rate will be calculated at 16 weeks and 6 months from the first treatment
effective rate, Effective assessment is performed by a senior dermatologist., Effective rate will be calculated at 16 weeks from the first treatment|recurrence rate, A wart was considered recurrence if there are abnormalities or palpated foreign body in the original place., Recurrence rate will be calculated at 12 months from the first treatment|average cure days, Cure days was defined as the period from the first treatment until the date of clearance., Average cure days will be calculated at 6 months from the first treatment|side effects, including pain, swelling, blisters, blood blisters, bruising, bleeding,scarring, hypopigmentation, hyperpigmentation., Side effects will be assessed within 3-4 weeks after each treatment|pain intensity, on a scale of 0-10, where 0 is no pain and 10 is extremely painful, Pain intensity will be assessed within 3-4 weeks after each treatment|patient satisfaction, on a five-point scale, from 'very satisfied' to 'very satisfied', Patient satisfactionwill be assessed within 3-4 weeks after each treatment|treatment costs, record the cost after each treatment, Treatment costs will be recorded within 10 minutes after each treatment|relationship between HPV type and curative effect, take a small amount of cutaneous warts lesions and extract HPV DNA before treatment, Relationship between HPV type and curative effect will be analyzed at 16 weeks and 6 months from the first treatment
Cutaneous warts were a common skin diseases caused by human papilloma virus (HPV) infection. Although warts may spontaneously resolve, many patients seek for treatment for various reasons. There are many kinds of treatments for cutaneous warts, including salicylic acid, cryotherapy, laser, etc. A recent high quality RCT confirmed that the cure rate of topical salicylic acid and frozen has no difference at six months, but the efficacy of laser versus cryotherapy on the treatment of warts remains unclear. Therefore, we designed a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of laser versus cryotherapy on the treatment of warts.
