This study is a prospective, double-blind, multicenter, randomized controlled phase II clinical trial of tislelizumab combined with chemotherapy and all trans retinoic acid in the treatment of locally advanced non-surgical or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. The aim is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tislelizumab combined with chemotherapy and all trans retinoic acid in the treatment of locally advanced non-surgical or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Patients with locally advanced inoperable or metastatic ESCC can only be enrolled after meeting the criteria. They will receive treatment with tislelizumab combined with chemotherapy+all trans retinoic acid or tislelizumab combined with chemotherapy+placebo, with a treatment cycle of every 3 weeks. The treatment will continue until disease progression or reaching the criteria for terminating the study drug treatment, for a maximum of two years.
