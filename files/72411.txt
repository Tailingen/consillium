Incidence of DLT (dose limiting toxicity) of BAY 94-9343, At the end of Cycle 1 Day21|Determination of the Pharmacokinetic profile of BAY94-9343 and its metabolites (ADC, Total Antibody, DM4 and DM4-Me), Q3W Arm: Cmax, AUC (0-504), AUC (0-tlast), tmax, t1/2 and AUC (Cycle 1 only) Q3W: Cycle 1 and Cycle 3: pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 5, 8, (24), 48, (96), 168, 336 and 504 hours after start of infusion QW Arm:Cmax, AUC(0-168) and tmax) QW: Cycle 1 and Cycle 3: pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 5, 8, 24, 48 and 168 hours after start of infusion, Cycle 1 and Cycle 3: pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 5, 8, (24), 48, (96), 168, 336 and 504 hours after start of infusion
Biomarker evaluation: Plasma concentrations of soluble mesothelin and Cytokeratin 18 (CK18), C1D1: pre-dose, 24, 48, and 168h after start of infusion; C2D1: pre-dose, 4 and 168h after start of infusion; C3D1: pre-dose, 24, 48, and 168h after start of infusion; C4 and every even cycle: pre-dose until Implementation of Am 6|Tumor response: assessment of best response and PFS (progression free survival) according to RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours) 1.1, 1 year/Screening; Within 5 days before the end of every even cycle until Cycle 8 (Cycle 2, Cycle 4, etc.); Within 5 days before the end of every 4th cycle after Cycle 8 (Cycle 12, 16, etc.); end of treatment|Immunogenicity assessment: assessment of Anti-drug antibody (ADA) formation and neutralizing antibodies (NAs) against anetumab ravtansine, 1 year / Cycle 1, 2 and 3 Day 1: pre-dose; Day 1 of every even cycle starting from Cycle 4 (Cycle 4, 6, 8 etc.): pre-dose until implementation of Am 6|Biomarker evaluation - Levels of mesothelin expression in tumor tissue, Anytime prior to general screening
