Genomic Analysis of Pediatric Bone Tumors
To determine whether gene expression analysis of primary tumor samples before and after chemotherapy are predictive of long-term survival in pediatric patients with bone sarcomas (Ewings sarcoma (ES) and Osteosarcoma(OS)).
Bone Cancer
% necrosis post chemotherapy, his is measured at the time of sample collection since we are looking for % necrosis in the sample we are collecting|overall survival and event free survival, This is measured at the time the patient dies, or at the time when patient relapses from their disease. There is no set time since this outcome is individually assessed.
