A Study to Assess Safety and Efficacy of Vilaprisan in Subjects With Uterine Fibroids
The primary objective of this study is to describe the efficacy of vilaprisan in subjects with uterine fibroids compared to ulipristal.

The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of different treatment regimens of vilaprisan in subjects with uterine fibroids.
Uterine Fibroids
DRUG: Vilaprisan (BAY1002670)
Amenorrhea (yes/no), Defined as menstrual blood loss (MBL) \< 2 mL based on the menstrual pictogram (MP) during last 28 days.

For the primary analysis of the primary variable, the amenorrhea rates after 12 weeks of treatment in Groups A1, A2 and A3 will be compared to the rate from Group B., At 3 months (at the end of treatment perid 1)
Total volume of menstrual blood loss, Assessed by menstrual pictogram (MP). Volume of menstrual blood loss will be normalized by 28 days., After approximately 1 year in subgroup 1 and after approximately 2 years in subgroup 2|Number of bleeding days, From day 1 of the first treatment period until the day before the next treatment period after the last treatment period would start again normalized to 28 days., After approximately 1 year in subgroup 1 and after approximately 2 years in subgroup 2|Amenorrhea (yes/no), Defined as menstrual blood loss (MBL) \< 2 mL based on the menstrual pictogram (MP) during last 28 days of the treatment period., At 6 months, at 12 months, at 15 months, at 18 months, at 21 months and at 24 months|Absence of bleeding (spotting allowed), Absence of bleeding defined as no bleeding (spotting allowed) during the last 28 days of the treatment; based on the UF-DBD (Uterine Fibroid Daily Symptom Diary)., Up to 24 months|Time to onset of controlled bleeding, Onset of controlled bleeding is defined by the first day, for which the menstrual blood loss (assessed by MP) for all subsequent 28-day periods up to the end of the treatment period is less than 80.00 mL., Quarterly up to 24 months|HMB (Heavy Menstrual Bleeding) responder rate, Percentage of subjects with blood loss \< 80.00 mL per 28 days and 50% reduction compared to baseline \[assessed by MP\], By treatment period up to 24 months|Percent change in volume of largest fibroid compared to baseline, Measured by MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)., At baseline, at 12 months and at 24 months|Endometrial histology, E.g., benign endometrium, presence or absence of hyperplasia or malignancy, Up to 24 months|Endometrial thickness, Up to 24 months
