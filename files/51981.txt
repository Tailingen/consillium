This study is a prospective, single-arm, single-center phase II trial. The purpose of the trial is evaluated Disitamab Vedotin (RC48) plus Cadonilimab (AK104) as first-line therapy for HER2-overexpressing advanced stomach carcinoma, and also check the adverse events (AEs) when participants are administered the combination treatment regimen. This study will include patients with HER2-overexpressing, locally advanced unresectable or metastatic gastric/gastroesophageal junction cancer who have not previously received systemic treatment including chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. Enrolled patients will be treated with disitamab vedotin (2.5mg/kg, D1, ivdrip, Q2W) combined with cadonilimab (6mg/kg, D1, ivdrip, Q2W) until progressive disease (PD) or intolerable toxicity.
