A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Study For Subjects With Locally-advanced Unresectable or Metastatic Synovial Sarcoma (V943-003, IMDZ-04-1702)
To assess if the CMB305 vaccine regimen may help the body's immune system to slow or stop the growth of synovial sarcoma tumor and improve survival.

Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the investigator-determined date of disease progression or death, whichever comes first, using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1)., From randomization to investigator-determined date of disease progression or death, assessed up to 24 months.|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization to the date of death., From randomization to date of death, assessed up to 66 months.
Time to Next Treatment (TTNT), TTNT is defined as the time from randomization to the start of post-study treatment subsequent intervention: \[TTNT = start date of subsequent intervention - randomization date + 1\]. Subsequent intervention includes anticancer therapy, cancer-related surgery and local regional therapy. Participants who do not start any post-study treatment intervention will be censored at their last known date of being alive., From last dose of CMB305 to initiation of new therapy, assessed up to 24 months.|Distant Metastasis Free Survival (DMFS), DMFS is defined as the time from randomization to evidence of a new distant metastasis not documented at time of randomization: \[DMFS = a new distant metastasis documented date - randomization date + 1\]. Participants who do not have any new distant metastasis will be censored at their last tumor assessment., From randomization to investigator-determined date of disease progression or death, assessed up to 24 months.|Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR defined by RECIST v1.1 will be summarized by the number and percent of subjects who achieve a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on the investigator's assessment. ORR will be compared between treatment arms using a logistic regression., From randomization to investigator-determined date of disease progression, assessed up to 24 months.|Number of Participants Who Experienced a Treatment-Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE), Safety will be assessed primarily based on reported adverse events (AEs), Medical Events of Interest (MEOIs), laboratory values, and concomitant medications reported from initiation of treatment with CMB305 or placebo., From randomization to investigator-determined date of disease progression or death, assessed up to approximately 2 months.|Quality of Life (QoL): EuroQol 5-Dimension 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) and EuroQol 5-Dimension Youth (EQ-5D-Y) Questionnaires, QoL evaluated using the EQ-5D-5L for participants â‰¥18 years of age or using the EQ-5D-Y for participants 12 to \<18 years of age. EQ-5D-5L descriptive system is comprised of 5 dimensions-mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort \& anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: not at all (level 1), mild (level 2), moderate (level 3), severe (level 4), extreme/leading to incapacity (level 5), with highest level corresponding to worst outcome. Participants indicated their health state by choosing the appropriate level from each dimension. The 5 digit health states thus obtained for each dimension were then converted into a single median index value using the EQ-5D-5L crosswalk index value calculator as recommended by EuroQol group. In the EQ-VAS, participants recorded their health state on a scale ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state)., From Day 1 up to 12 months|Number of Participants Who Discontinued Study Treatment Due to an AE, The number of all participants who discontinued study treatment due to an AE is presented., Up to approximately 2 months
The Synovate Study is a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study in patients with unresectable, locally-advanced or metastatic New York esophageal squamous cell carcinoma 1 (NY-ESO-1) positive synovial sarcoma following first-line systemic anti-cancer therapy.
