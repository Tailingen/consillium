DAHANCA 28A: Phase I/II Study on Accelerated, Hyperfractionated Radiotherapy With Concomitant Cisplatin and Nimorazole
P16 negative cancers continue to have a dismal prognosis despite advances in the treatment of head and neck cancer. Acceleration, dose-escalation, hyperfractionation, chemotherapy and nimorazole has been shown to improve local control. The purpose of the study i to investigate the level of co-morbidity and performance status (PS) that allows the combination of all of the above means of treatment intensification

RADIATION: 76 Gy/ 56 fx/ 10/W with cisplatin 40 mg/m2/W and nimorazole
Compliance, Proportion of patients that receive radiotherapy in accordance to prescribed dose and treatment time, End of radiotherapy (approximately 5.5 weeks after start of radiotherapy)
Acute toxicity, In accordance with the Danish Head and Neck Cancer Group (DAHANCA) toxicity scales, 2 months after end of radiotherapy|Response rate, Proportion of complete and partial responders, 2 months after end of radiotherapy
