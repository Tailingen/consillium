A Study of Mavrilimumab Versus Anti Tumor Necrosis Factor in Subjects With Rheumatoid Arthritis
The primary objectives of this study is to explore the efficacy of mavrilimumab compared with golimumab in the treatment of adult subjects 18-80 years of age with moderate-to-severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have an inadequate response to one or more conventional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and/or one or two anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents (excluding golimumab) for efficacy or safety reasons.

Each item was scored on 4-point scale from 0 to 3: 0=no difficulty; 1=some difficulty; 2=much difficulty; 3=unable to do. Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score range from 0 to 3; where 0 = least difficulty and 3 = extreme difficulty.

Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Treatment-Emergent Serious Adverse Events (TESAEs), An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and Day 169 that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state. TEAE and TESAE were reported as per relatedness and severity., Baseline up to Day 169|Number of Participants With Abnormal Clinical Laboratory Parameters Reported as Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Any medically significant change in laboratory evaluations were recorded as adverse events. Following parameters were analyzed for laboratory examination: hematology (leukocytosis, neutropenia, anaemia of chronic disease); serum chemistry (alanine aminotransferase, blood parathyroid hormone, gamma glutamyl transferase, hepatic enzyme, dyslipidaemia, hypercholesterolaemia, hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia); urinalysis., Baseline up to Day 169|Number of Participants With Abnormal Vital Signs Reported as Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Vital sign assessments included blood pressure, pulse rate, temperature, weight and respiration rate.

FEV1 was the maximal volume of air exhaled in the first second of a forced expiration from a position of full inspiration. FEV6 was the maximal volume of air exhaled in the six second of a forced expiration from a position of full inspiration. FVC was the volume of air which can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs after taking the deepest breath possible.

Total score range: 0-9.4, higher score = more disease activity. DAS28 (ESR) \<3.2 = low disease activity, \>=3.2 to 5.1 = moderate to high disease activity and \<2.6= remission. The percentage of participants were calculated by logistic regression model method., Day 169|Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) Remission at Day 169, The SDAI was the numerical sum of five outcome parameters: TJC and SJC based on a 28-joint assessment, patient global assessment and physician global assessment assessed on 0 - 10 centimetre (cm) VAS; and C-reactive protein (CRP) (milligram per deciliter \[mg/dL\]). The SDAI total score ranges from 0 to 86, where higher scores indicates greater affection due to disease activity. SDAI remission was defined as a score less than or equal to 3.3.

CDAI remission was defined as a score less than or equal to 2.8., Day 169|Percentage of Participants With American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) Remission at Day 169, The ACR/EULAR remission was defined as swollen joint count (0-66), tender joint count (0-68), CRP (mg/dL) and participant global assessment (0-10) all less than or equal to one., Day 169|Mean Change From Baseline in Swollen and Tender Joint Count at Day 169, Number of swollen joints was determined by examination of 66 joints and identifying when swelling was present. The number of swollen joints was recorded on the joint assessment form, no swelling = 0, swelling =1. Number of tender joints was determined by examining 68 joints and identified the joints that were painful under pressure or to passive motion. The number of tender joints was recorded on the joint assessment form, no tenderness = 0, tenderness = 1. Mean here indicates adjusted mean., Baseline and Day 169|Mean Change From Baseline in Patient Assessment of Pain at Day 169, Participants rated the severity of arthritis pain on a 0 to 100 millimeter (mm) Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), where 0 mm = no pain and 100 mm = most severe pain., Baseline and Day 169|Mean Change From Baseline in Patient Global Assessment (PGA) of Disease Activity at Day 169, Participants responded to a question, "Considering all the ways your arthritis affects you, how are you feeling today?" by using a 0 - 100 mm VAS, where 0 = very well and 100 = very poorly., Baseline and Day 169|Mean Change From Baseline in Physician Global Assessment of Disease Activity (MDGA) at Day 169, Physician Global Assessment of Arthritis was measured by asking the physician to assess the participant's current arthritis disease activity by placing a vertical line on a 0 to 10 cm VAS, where 0 cm = very good and 10 cm = very bad., Baseline and Day 169|Mean Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Score at Day 169, HAQ-DI: participant-reported assessment of ability to perform tasks in 8 categories of daily living activities: dress/groom; arise; eat; walk; reach; grip; hygiene; and common activities over past week. Each item was scored on 4-point scale from 0 to 3: 0=no difficulty; 1=some difficulty; 2=much difficulty; 3=unable to do. Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score range from 0 to 3; where 0 = least difficulty and 3 = extreme difficulty., Baseline and Day 169|Ratio of Change C-Reactive Protein (CRP) at Day 169 to Baseline, The ratio of change from baseline for CRP was analyzed and reported. The CRP is a substance produced by the liver that increases in the presence of inflammation in the body. The test for CRP is a laboratory measurement for evaluation of an acute phase reactant of inflammation through the use of an ultrasensitive assay. A decrease in the level of CRP indicates reduction in inflammation and therefore improvement in underlying disease., Baseline and Day 169|Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) at Day 169, ESR is a laboratory test that provides a non-specific measure of inflammation. The test assesses the rate at which red blood cells fall in a test tube. The farther the red blood cells have descended, the greater the inflammatory response., Day 169|Serum Concentrations of Mavrilimumab, Serum concentrations after subcutaneous dose of mavrilimumab were calculated, Baseline, Day 8, 15, 29, 85, 141, and 169|Number of Participants Exhibiting Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADAs) to Mavrilimumab, Immunogenicity assessment included determination of anti-drug (mavrilimumab) antibodies in serum samples. ADA detection measured by using electrochemiluminescence assays., Day 1 to Day 169
Despite the therapeutic improvements with recent biologic agents approved for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), there is still a significant unmet medical need for the treatment of subjects with this chronic disease to achieve a faster, more complete response, and higher rates of remission. The aim of the current study is to compare the efficacy and safety of a subcutaneous dose of mavrilimumab with a marketed treatment for RA (golimumab) in 120 adult subjects with moderate-to-severe active RA who have had an inadequate response to one or two anti-TNF agents with mavrilimumab. The design of the study was exploratory and not formerly statistically powered.
