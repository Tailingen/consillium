RAS Mutation Testing in the Circulating Blood of Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
This study will evaluate the concordance of RAS mutation detection between the results obtained from circulating tumor DNA and those obtained with the "standard" method (testing from tumor tissue).
Colorectal Cancer
Concordance regarding the mutation of RAS (yes vs no, dichotomous variable) between the two methods, RAS mutations will be compared between tumor tissue (standard testing methods) and results obtained from circulating tumor DNA, Baseline
Concordance regarding the mutation of RAS (yes vs no, dichotomous variable) between the two methods in patients for whom circulating tumor DNA has been identified in the avalaible plasma sample., RAS mutations will be compared between tumor tissue (standard testing methods) and results obtained from circulating tumor DNA. This subgroup of patients is defined as patients with at least one mutation identified in the panel of tested genes (Ion AmpliSeq Colon and Lung Cancer Panel) (RAS mutation or mutations on other genes TP53, PIK3CA, SMAD4 .... ) or with at least one methylated biomarker identified (for patients with no mutation identified in the panel of genes tested)., Baseline|Comparison of the timelines to obtain results between the two methods, Timelines to obtain RAS mutations will be compared between tumor tissue (standard testing methods) and circulating tumor DNA, Baseline|Comparisons of the costs between the two methods, Costs for the two methods will be compared between tumor tissue (standard testing methods) and circulating tumor DNA, Baseline
