The Comparison of TACE-Lenvatinib With TACE-Lenvatinib-ablation for Intermediate Recurrent Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Studies have shown that combination therapy of TACE with Lenvatinib could achieve better survival outcomes than TACE alone for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at BCLC B stage. However, whether patients could benefit from the ablation for intermediate recurrent HCC (RHCC) is still need high quality clinical evidence. This study is to evaluate the efficacy of ablation combined with TACE and Lenvatinib for the intermediate-stage RHCC.

PROCEDURE: TACE|PROCEDURE: Ablation|DRUG: Lenvatinb
Progression free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of inclusion to the date of the first objectively documented tumor progression or death due to any cause., 24 months
Overall survival (OS), OS is the length of time from the date of inclusion until death from any cause., 36 month|Objective response rate (ORR), ORR, as determined based on tumor response according to mRECIST, is defined as partial response and complete response., 12 months
The evidence of ablation combined transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) and Lenvatinib for intermediate-stage recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (RHCC) is limited. Patient responses to this treatment vary because of the heterogeneous nature of RHCC. Thus, it is important to identify patients who are most likely to benefit from this three regimes therapy. The aim of this study is to comparison of TACE-Lenvatinib with TACE-Lenvatinib-ablation for intermediate RHCC.
