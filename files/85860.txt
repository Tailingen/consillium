Blood-borne Assessment of Stromal Activation in Esophageal Adenocarcinoma to Guide Tocilizumab Therapy
The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that stroma-targeting by tocilizumab in patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction with highly activated stroma increases efficacy of chemoradiotherapy measured by pathological response according to the Mandard criteria. Patients will be grouped for ADAM12, a non-invasive blood-borne marker of stromal activation.

DRUG: Tocilizumab 20 Mg/mL Intravenous Solution|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin|RADIATION: External beam radiotherapy
Efficacy defined as pathological response to chemoradiotherapy according to the Mandard criteria, The primary outcome is efficacy of tocilizumab in patients with high and low stroma activation defined as pathological response according to the Mandard criteria, 34 months

Predictive biomarkers using oa RNA sequencing, Exploratory objectives are to identify additional predictive biomarkers based on tumor, fecal and blood samples. Among others we will use RNA sequencing., 54 months
Randomized phase II proof-of-concept study with tocilizumab and standard of care paclitaxel, carboplatin and radiation followed by surgical resection of the oesophagus for patients with surgically resectable adenocarcinomas of the oesophagus or oesophageal junction. Patients will be grouped for serum ADAM12 with a cutoff of 203 ng/mL. Patients in both groups will be randomized to receive tocilizumab 8mg/kg on day 1, 15 and 29 or not in addition to paclitaxel 50mg/m2, carboplatin dosed with area under the curve (AUC) 2 on day 1, 8, 15, 22 and 29 and radiation 41.4 Gy in 23 fractions. Surgery will be planned approximately in week 13-15, which is 8 to 10 weeks after the end of chemoradiation.
