A Study of Mental Health Care in People With Cancer
The purpose of this study is to look at mental health services for adults with depressed mood who were diagnosed with cancer at the age of 65 or older. This study will compare the usual approach for connecting older adults with depressed mood to mental health services with the Open Door for Cancer (OD-C) approach. We will find out if the OD-C approach is practical and useful for cancer patients who participate in the intervention and for providers who see or treat cancer patients.
