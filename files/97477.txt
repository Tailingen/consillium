Culturally Tailored Decision Aid for Hispanic Patients Diagnosed With Prostate Cancer
A pilot study testing the effect of an in-visit English and Spanish language decision aid for Hispanic-Latino men using best practices of cultural tailoring to be used in urology practice. Subjects will be followed for approximately 1 year during standard care in-clinic office visits. Study results and subject surveys will be analyzed to determine clinical utility of the tool.

The objective of this research is to determine the effect of a culturally tailored decision aid tool on the cancer treatment decisions of Hispanic-Latino patients.

The specific aims are:

i. To develop and pilot test in an uncontrolled fashion an in-visit English and Spanish language decision aid for Hispanic-Latino men using best practices of cultural tailoring to be used in urology practice ii. To pilot and test the impact of a culturally tailored, English and Spanish language version of the Prostate Choice in-visit decision aid on decision quality, knowledge, and quality of life in low-income Hispanic/Latino patients diagnosed with localized prostate cancer iii. To assess the barriers and facilitators of decision aid use including the relative contribution of language-concordance on 1-year practice implementation parameters.
