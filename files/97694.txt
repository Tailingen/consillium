Chidamide Combined With Azacitidine and Mitoxantrone Liposome in the Treatment of Relapsed/Refractory (nTFHL)
Intranodal follicular adjuvant T-cell lymphoma (nTFHL) is a type of peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) that is a new subtype in WHO 2022, which includes 3 categories corresponding to previous angioimmunoblast T-cell lymphoma (AITL), follicular T-cell lymphoma, and PTCL with TFH phenotype, named nTFHL-angioblast type ( nTFHL-AI), nTFHL-follicular (nTFHL-F), and nTFHL-non-specific (nTFH-NOS), respectively.1 nTFHL-AI has a relatively high incidence in PTCL, accounting for about 25-30% of cases, with an aggressive clinical presentation, often with multisystem involvement and with immune system abnormalities. nTFHL shares common immunophenotypic features, namely TFH cell phenotype: CD279/PD1, CD10, BCL6, CXCL13, ICOS, SAP, and CCR5, and at least 2 of the stated immune markers combined with CD4 positivity are required for the diagnosis of nTFHL.1, TFH cell and nTFHL cell also share similar reproducible genetic abnormalities, such as RHOA G17V, DNMT3A, IDH2, TET2, often involving epigenetic genetic abnormalities 2, especially abnormalities of DNMT3A, IDH2, and TET2 are more frequent in myeloid disorders.

Basic studies have shown that cidabenamide and anthracyclines have synergistic effects to promote apoptosis in PTCL cells; and the adverse events of the two do not completely overlap, suggesting that a mitoxantrone liposome-based regimen combined with cidabenamide for PTCL may have a better clinical benefit.

Based on the above findings, the investigators propose to further investigate the efficacy and safety of cidapenem combined with azacitidine and mitoxantrone liposome (CAM) regimen, i.e., cidapenem combined with azacitidine dual epigenetic modulation on the basis of mitoxantrone liposome, in the treatment of patients with R/R nTFHL using a randomized, prospective, multicenter phase II clinical trial, which is expected to further improve ORR, PFS and OS.
