This is a single arm, open-label, single-center study. This study is indicated for relapsed or refractory Relapsed and/or Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia and B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. The selections of dose levels and the number of subjects are based on clinical trials of similar foreign products. 72 patients will be enrolled. Primary objective is to explore the safety, main consideration is dose-related safety.
