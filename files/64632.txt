An Study of Patidegib Topical Gel, 2%, for the Reduction of Disease Burden of Persistently Developing Basal Cell Carcinomas in Patients With Non-Gorlin High Frequency BCC
This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, stratified, vehicle-controlled study of the efficacy and safety of Patidegib Topical Gel, 2%, applied topically twice daily to the face of adult participants with non-Gorlin HF-BCC (high-frequency basal cell carcinoma). Participants will be randomized (1:1) to receive either Patidegib Topical Gel, 2%, or Vehicle for 9 months. Randomization will be stratified by gender. The primary endpoint is the number of nSEB (surgically eligible basal cell carcinoma) that develop on the face over the 9 month period. The primary end point will be assessed by imaging and tracking of BCCs consistently throughout the study in order to identify nSEBs.
