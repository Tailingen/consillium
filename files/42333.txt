BIOLOGICAL: V930|BIOLOGICAL: V932
To determine the safety and tolerability of V930/V932 followed by EP in cancer patients, Week 22
To determine whether V930/V932 can elicit HER-2 specific and CEA specific immune responses measured using an ELISPOT assay, Week 22
The optional followup period for this study is 1 year after the last vaccination.
