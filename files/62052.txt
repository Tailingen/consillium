Feasibility Study on the Use of PET-MRI / 68Ga-PSMA Imaging for HIFU-focal Treatment in the Event of Recurrent Prostate Cancer After Radiotherapy - PSMA Study
A significant proportion of patients with localized prostate cancer, and treated for curative intent by radiotherapy, have a local recurrence. Among these patients with local recurrence, few receive curative remedial treatment but most of them are treated with palliative hormonal therapy without any chance of long-term recovery.

The use of Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) in focal treatment (only on recurrence) is an effective and not very morbid option, especially compared to surgery. The quality of this treatment is conditioned by both an early diagnosis of recurrence, a precise localization of recurrence in the prostate and a rigorous extension assessment for the detection of occult metastases.

Innovations in medical imaging have led to the development of a new generation of "hybrid" machines that combine PET (Positron Emission Tomodensitometry) and MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) technology. Associated with the use of 68Gallium-labeled PSMA (Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen), a new tracer specific for prostate cancer, the investigators believe that this PET-MRI imaging technique can:

1. To identify at an early stage the metastatic patients and to allow a more adapted therapeutic management.
2. A better evaluation of the limits of local recurrence and therefore a more precise definition than with MRI alone of the tumor zone to be destroyed.

Finally, the investigators believe that the PET-MRI / 68Ga-PSMA exam, used for the selection of patients eligible for focal HIFU treatment and used for the treatment itself, should allow obtaining an optimal control of the cancer recurrence with the least possible side effects.

PROCEDURE: Focal HIFU using PET-MRI/68Ga-PSMA imaging guidance
Feasibility to use the PET-MRI/68Ga-PSMA imaging for Focal-HIFU guidance, The feasibility to use the PET-MRI/68Ga-PSMA imaging for Focal-HIFU guidance will be evaluated by the possibility or not to use the target tumor contouring with the TEP-IRM au \[68Ga\]PSMA. This possibility will be determine for each patient with a systematic reviewing of TEP-IRM/\[68Ga\]PSMA and the target tumor contouring by 2 experts: a nuclear medicine specialist for TEP/\[68Ga\] PSMA and a radiologist, prostate MRI specialized., At the time of the HIFU-focal treatment
Interest of hybrid PET-MRI/[68Ga]PSMA imaging compared to PET-Choline for the metastasis detection during the initial assessment of first recurrence after radiotherapy., Interest of hybrid PET-MRI/\[68Ga\]PSMA imaging compared to PET-Choline for the metastasis detection during the initial assessment for first recurrence after radiotherapy will be evaluated by the proportion of patient who could not be treated by Focal-HIFU because of evidence of metastasis after the first PET-MRI/\[68Ga\]PSMA (screening failure rate)., Screening period.|Interest of hybrid PET-MRI/[68Ga]PSMA imaging compared to standard multiparametric MRI performed at the initial assessment AND 6 month after Focal-HIFU., Interest of hybrid PET-MRI/\[68Ga\]PSMA imaging compared to standard multiparametric MRI will be evaluated by tumor volume comparison between both imaging method at the initial assessment AND 6 months after Focal-HIFU, 6 months after focal HIFU therapy|Biological recurrence, Biological recurrence will be evaluated by the proportion of biological recurrence, defined by a PSA nadir increase of more than 2 ng/mL at 3 and 6 months after Focal-HIFU., 3 months and 6 months after focal HIFU therapy|Local control of tumor recurrence 6 months after Focal-HIFU guided by PET-MRI/[68Ga]PSMA imaging., Local control of tumor recurrence 6 months after Focal-HIFU guided by PET-MRI/\[68Ga\]PSMA imaging will be evaluated by a second imaging assessment by PET-MRI/\[68Ga\]PSMA à 6 months after Focal-HIFU. In case of PSMA fixation on this imaging assessment, prostate biopsies will be performed., 6 months after focal HIFU therapy|Proportion of positives prostate biopsies, Carcinologic evolution will be evaluated according to usual assessment performed for biological recurrence with proportion of positives prostate biopsies in the treated lobe and/or in the non-treated lobe., 3 months and 6 months after focal HIFU therapy|Gleason score, Carcinologic evolution will be evaluated according to usual assessment performed for biological recurrence with evolution of the Gleason score (4+3 = 7 or ≥ 8)., 3 months and 6 months after focal HIFU therapy|Extracapsular extension of prostate cancer., Carcinologic evolution will be evaluated according to usual assessment performed for biological recurrence with extracapsular extension of prostate cancer., 3 months and 6 months after focal HIFU therapy|Metastatic free survival, The metastatic free survival will be measured from the inclusion date to the date of first metastasis confirmation, Over the 6 months after focal HIFU therapy|QLQC30 score (Quality of life questionnaire), Quality of life will be assessed using the QLQC30 (Quality of Life questionnaire) questionnaire. It is a specific questionnaire to determine the quality of life a patient with cancer. It is composed of 30 questions with 4 potential answers going from: not at all, a little, enough or a lot, within 28 questions and with a visual scale going from 1 to 7 (7 being excellent and 1 being very bad) for the last 2 questions. The raw score is established by adding the score of each question and a linear transformation range it from 0 to 100. The higher the score, the better the quality of life., 3 months and 6 months after focal HIFU therapy|EPIC-26 score (Urinary function questionnaire), Urinary function will be assessed using the EPIC-26 (The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite) questionnaire. The EPIC-26 is a self-reported scale health-related quality of life questionnaire for prostate cancer patients. It is composed of 26 items in 4 different domains: urinary incontinence, urinary irritation/obstruction, bowel, sexual, and vitality/hormonal.

Response options for each EPIC item form a Likert scale, and multi-item scale scores are transformed linearly to a 0-100 scale. Each items as a standardized value from 0 to 100. Then the average of the standardized value is determined in each domain to crate the summary score. The higher the score, the better the quality of life., 3 months and 6 months after focal HIFU therapy|IPSS score (Urinary function questionnaire), Urinary function will be assessed using the IPSS (International Prostate Score Symptom) questionnaire. The IPSS questionnaire is based on the answers to seven questions concerning urinary symptoms and one question concerning quality of life. Each question concerning urinary symptoms allows the patient to choose one out of six answers indicating increasing severity of the particular symptom. The answers are assigned points from 0 to 5. The total score can therefore range from 0 to 35. The score is then categorized as follow: Mild (symptoms score less than or equal to 7), Moderate (symptom score range 8-19), Severe (symptom score range 20-35). The higher the score, the worse the symptoms., 3 months and 6 months after focal HIFU therapy|IIEF-5 score (Sexual function questionnaire), Sexual function will be assessed using will be assessed using the IIEF-5 (The International Index of Erectile Function) questionnaire.The IIEF-5 Questionnaire is composed of 5 items with 5 possible answers rating from 1 to 5 (very low, low, moderate, high, very high).

The score is the sum of the ordinal responses to the 56 items. It is then categorized as follow: 22-25: No erectile dysfunction, 17-21: Mild erectile dysfunction, 12-16: Mild to moderate erectile dysfunction, 8-11: Moderate erectile dysfunction, 5-7: Severe erectile dysfunction. The higher the score, the better the sexual function., 3 months and 6 months after focal HIFU therapy|Adverse event evaluation, Adverse events assessment between patient inclusion to the last study visit at 6 months (+/- 30 days) after Focal-HIFU treatment, During 6 months of follow-up after focal HIFU therapy|Ancillary study: Measure of anti-tumoral immunity induction, The consequences of HIFU treatment over immune anti-tumoral induction will be estimated by the description of Programmed death-ligand 1/ligand 2 (PDL1/L2) overexpression on immune cells and overexpression of Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) on T lymphocytes (T-cells)., Over the 6 months|Circulating Tumor Cells (CTC) number, The consequences of HIFU treatment over Messenger RNA (mRNA) will be estimated by measure of CTC number reduction (ancillary study)., Over the 6 months|ncRNA (non-coding RNA) PCA3 (Prostate cancer gene 3) level, The consequences of HIFU treatment over PCA3 will be estimated by measure of ncRNA PCA3 level reduction (ancillary study)., Over the 6 months
