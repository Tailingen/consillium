A Study of Anti-PD-1 AK105 in Patients With Metastatic Squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a phase III, randomized, double-blinded, multicenter clinical study to evaluate the efficiency and safety of AK105 (Anti-PD1 antibody) plus paclitaxel and carboplatin vs placebo plus paclitaxel and carboplatin as First-line Therapy in patients with metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer.

Progression-free survival (PFS) in intent-to-treat (ITT) population, assessed by Independent Radiologist Review Committee(IRRC) in accordance with RECIST v1.1, PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization till the first documentation of disease progression (per RECIST v1.1 criteria) assessed by IRRC or death due to any cause (whichever occurs first)., Up to approximately 2 years|PFS in PD-L1-selected population, assessed by IRRC in accordance with RECIST v1.1, PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization till the first documentation of disease progression (per RECIST v1.1 criteria) assessed by IRRC or death due to any cause (whichever occurs first)., Up to approximately 2 years
Overall survival (OS) in ITT population, OS is the time from the date of randomization to death due to any cause., Up to approximately 2 years|Overall survival (OS) in PD-L1-selected population, OS is the time from the date of randomization to death due to any cause., Up to approximately 2 years|PFS assessed by the investigator in accordance with RECIST v1.1, PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization till the first documentation of disease progression (per RECIST v1.1 criteria) assessed by the investigator or death due to any cause (whichever occurs first)., Up to approximately 2 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is the proportion of subjects with CR or PR , based on RECIST v1.1., Up to approximately 2 years|Duration of response (DoR), DoR is defined as the duration from the first documentation of objective response to the first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 2 years|Disease control rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the proportion of subjects with CR, PR, or SD, based on RECIST v1.1., Up to approximately 2 years|Incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence or the deterioration of existing medical event in a clinical study subject administered an investigational drug, which does not necessarily have an unequivocal causal relationship with the investigational product., From the time of informed consent signed through 90 days after last dose of AK105|Observed concentrations of AK105, The endpoints for assessment of PK of AK105 include serum concentrations of AK105 at different timepoints after AK105 administration., From first dose of AK105 through 90 days after last dose of AK105|Number of subjects who develop detectable anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), The immunogenicity of AK105 will be assessed by summarizing the number of subjects who develop detectable anti-drug antibodies (ADAs)., From first dose of AK105 through 90 days after last dose of AK105
