A Study to Evaluate the Effect of HER2 Activation on rhuMAb 2C4 (Pertuzumab) in Subjects With Advanced Ovarian Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine if the study drug pertuzumab is effective in treating patients with advanced ovarian cancer that is refractory to, or has recurred following, prior chemotherapy.
Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: Pertuzumab (rhuMAb 2C4)
Percentage of Participants With Best Overall Response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) Determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version (v) 1.1 or Cancer Antigen 125 (CA-125) Changes, Response by tumor measurement occurred if there was documented and confirmed CR or PR determined by 2 consecutive investigator assessments that were at least 28 days apart. Response was assessed by either the RECIST v 1.1 or by CA-125 changes, based on measurable or non-measurable disease at baseline. Per RECIST v 1.1 (for measurable disease), CR: disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level; PR: at least a 30 percent (%) decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter. Per CA-125 changes (for non-measurable disease), CR: decrease in the CA-125 to within the normal limits and less than (\<) 40 international units per milliliter (IU/mL) and no clinical or radiological evidence of disease, PR: a greater than (\>) 50 percent (%) decrease in CA-125 values from baseline, and no clinical or radiological evidence of new lesions., Screening and prior to infusion at Cycles 3, 5, 7, 9, 13, and 17 and at follow-up (30 days after the last dose of pertuzumab)
Percentage of Participants With Disease Progression or Death (Progression Free Survival [PFS]), PFS was defined as the time from the first day of study drug treatment to the time of documented disease progression or death, whichever came first. Participants who were lost to follow-up or who had not progressed at the time of study completion or early termination were censored at the date of last tumor assessment. The percentage of participants experiencing disease progression or death was calculated as the number of participants with event divided by the number of participants analyzed, multiplied by 100., Screening and prior to infusion at Cycles 3, 5, 7, 9, 13, and 17 and at follow-up (30 days after the last dose of pertuzumab)|Median Time of PFS, PFS was defined as the time from the first day of study drug treatment to the time of documented disease progression or death, whichever came first. Participants who were lost to follow-up or who had not progressed at the time of study completion or early termination were censored at the date of last tumor assessment., Screening and prior to infusion at Cycles 3, 5, 7, 9, 13, and 17 and at follow-up (30 days after the last dose of pertuzumab)|Duration of Response, Duration of response was defined as the time from the initial CR or PR to the time of disease progression., Screening and prior to infusion at Cycles 3, 5, 7, 9, 13, and 17 and at follow-up (30 days after the last dose of pertuzumab)|Percentage of Participants Who Died, The percentage of participants experiencing death was calculated as the number of participants with event divided by the number of participants analyzed, multiplied by 100., Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycles 1 and 2, Day 1 of Cycles 3-17, follow-up (30 days after the last dose of pertuzumab) and then every 3 months until death or loss to follow-up (up to 5 years)|Overall Survival, Survival was the interval of time from date of first dose of study medication to date of death at any time. Participants who had not died were censored at the date of last contact when they were known to be alive., Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycles 1 and 2, Day 1 of Cycles 3-17, follow-up (30 days after the last dose of pertuzumab) and then every 3 months until death or loss to follow-up (up to 5 years)|Kaplan Meier Estimate of Percentage of Participants Who Were Free of Disease Progression at 3, 6, and 12 Months, Per RECIST v 1.1, disease progression was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions, and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions., 3, 6, and 12 months
The purpose of this study is to determine if the study drug pertuzumab is effective in treating patients with advanced ovarian cancer that is refractory to, or has recurred following, prior chemotherapy.
