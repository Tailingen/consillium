NK Cells as Consolidation Therapy of Acute Myeloid Leukemia in Children/Adolescents
The main goal of this study is to evaluate the anti-relapse prophylactic activity of inoculating Natural Killer (NK) cells as consolidation therapy of acute myeloid leukemia in paediatric patients with cytologic remission. The patients included have intermediate risk of relapse and no indication for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

After the standard induction and consolidation chemotherapy treatment, patients will receive five days of fludarabine to try to kill any minimal residual disease and prevent NK cell rejection. Two different NK cells infusions will be performed within one week (day 0 and 7). Interleukin 2 (IL-2) will be administrated to increase the cytotoxic activity of NK cells.

Hypothesis:

NK cells are the natural defence against cancer cells. Thus, supplementing compatible NK cells from a related donor might increase the probability to eliminate any residual chemotherapy resistant cell in Acute myelogenous leukemia patients.

Description:

NK cells will be donated from a compatible family member who has a certain genetic code in their blood, called HLA, which partly matches patient genetic code, reducing any potential rejection. Interleukin-2 is co administrated during NK cell treatment to improve effectiveness.

Methodology:

The day that patient receive first NK cell infusion is called day 0. The days before are called minus days (-D). Conversely, the days after NK cell infusion are called plus days (+D).

Study administration

* After standard chemotherapy treatment against acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and restoration of haematologic normal levels, patients will receive a 60mg/kg of cyclophosphamide (day -6) and five daily intravenous cycles 25 mg/m2 of the chemotherapic fludarabine every day (day -5, -4, -3, -2, -1).
* Day 0 will be settled from 24h to 48h after fludarabine treatment completion. NK cells will be intravenous administered twice (day 0 and day 7). The first dose of NK cells (day 0) will contain up to 5x10\^7 cells/kg with immunophenotype NK (CD3-CD56+). The second dose might be higher (up to 5x10\^8 cells/kg) in case of no treatment related toxicity after first NK injection. In any case, no more than 1x10\^6 cells/kg with an immunophenotype T (CD56-CD3+) will be administrated.
* From day 0, IL-2 1x10\^6 UI/m2 subcutaneous will be administrated three times a week during two weeks.

Study visits

Before and after the treatment a bone marrow aspirate will be analyzed in order to evaluate minimal residue disease (cytology, cytometry and/or molecular studies) at least one month after NK injection. objective response rate will be reevaluated at least once a year.

Before treatment starts:

* Birthday, gender and personal medical history will be recorded
* physical examination, including measurement of the vital signs (temperature, heart and breathing rate, etc...)
* Blood and urine test
* Bone marrow aspirate in order to evaluate the basal disease

On every visit

* Physical examination and vital signs will be recorded
* Adverse event form
* Other concomitant drugs

After NK treatment

* It will be 11 visits on days +30, +60, +90, +180, +270, +360, +480, +600, +720, +900, +1080 which included a blood and urine test and Lansky/karnofsky scale.
* Additionally on days +30, +360, +720 and +1080 a bone marrow aspirate will be performed to evaluate relapse.

Length of the study:

Up to 35 AML patients will be included in the study during a 32 months recruitment period with a patient follow-up of thirty-six months. The maximum length of the study will be six years.
