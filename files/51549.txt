Biomarkers Identification of Anti-tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) Î± Agent's Efficacy in Ankylosing Spondylitis Patients
To identify new candidate genes and proteins that are differentially expressed in responders' vs non-responders to anti-TNF alpha therapy at the several time points the investigators will use the transcriptomic and proteomic analyses. Demonstrate a link between gene expression and protein markers regarding prediction to anti-TNF alpha therapy efficacy.
