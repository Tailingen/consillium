Celecoxib Window of Opportunity Trial to Assess Tumor and Stroma Responses
The overall purpose of this study is to assess whether celecoxib can reduce the change in collagen alignment and inflammatory response in the tumor tissue of primary breast cancer patients with invasive breast carcinoma after 2 weeks of oral intake.
Breast Carcinoma
DRUG: Celecoxib
Changes in collagen, To determine change of collagen structure and proliferation in response to celecoxib intake in the tumor microenvironment., Up to 6 weeks

Advances in early detection techniques and improvement in systemic treatment of early stage breast cancer have led to a small decline in overall breast cancer mortality in the last 20 years. New advances will require understanding of breast cancer biology at the molecular level. Inhibition of COX-2 and its analysis of effect in breast cancer tumor microenvironment provide one such fruitful therapeutic target. Tumor microenvironment is poorly understood in breast cancer research. Despite new drugs being developed to treat breast cancer and tested in clinical trials, it is rarely possible to assess how the drug is affecting the breast cancer cells at a molecular level. The use of collagen properties such as alignment and deposition will allow giving a faster diagnosis of breast cancer status and seeing how celecoxib with respect to collagen can change the tumor microenvironment in human tissue. This window trial provides a way to look at cancer and stromal cells before and after celecoxib intake to see if the drug is actively working. If we can do this before and after a patient has surgery, and see how the tumor microenvironment responds, then the physician could pick a better suited adjuvant treatment for this patient after surgical intervention that would improve their overall survival rate.
