LTX-315 and Adoptive T-cell Therapy in Advanced Soft Tissue Sarcoma (ATLAS-IT-04)
ATLAS-IT-04 is a two part, single arm study designed to determine the safety and effectiveness of LTX-315 to induce T-cell infiltration prior to TIL expansion in patients with soft tissue sarcoma. Following intratumoural injection of LTX-315 to a selected lesion, the lesion will be extracted for T-cell culture, expansion and infusion.

Change in Total T-cell Level in Tumour Tissues From Baseline (Step 1, Week 1, Day 1) to End of Step 1 (Step 1, Week 3-5), The total T-cell level was measured at baseline and end of Step 1. Change from baseline was listed as absolute change. Data cannot be presented on subject-level and are therefore presented as the arithmetic mean value for the factor increase (+) or decrease (-) in number of cells/mm2 from baseline to end of Step 1., 15 to 42 days|Adverse Events (AE) Related to LTX-315 or to the Combination of LTX-315 and Adoptive T-cell Therapy From Baseline (Step 1, Week 1, Day 1) to End of Treatment (EoT) (Step 2, Week 7), AEs were events occurring during or after administration of the IMP. AEs were coded using MedDRA version 21.1 and were classified by System Organ Class (SOC), Preferred Term (PT) and Lowest Level Term (LLT).

Adverse events related to LTX-315 were events where causality to LTX-315 was marked on the adverse events page.

Adverse events related to the combination of LTX-315 and adoptive T-cell therapy were events where both causality to LTX-315 and at least one of the other IMPs (TILs, Sendoxan®, Fludara® and Proleukin®) were marked on the adverse event page., Up to 133 days
Change in CD3+CD8+ T Cell Density in Non-injected Tumour Tissues From Baseline (Step 1, Week 1, Day 1) to EoT (Step 2, Week 7), The change is described as factor change in CD8+ cells/mm2., Up to 133 days|Total Number of CD3+CD8+ T-cells in TIL Infusion Product, The composition of the TIL infusion product was evaluated for the subjects for whom it was possible to grow TILs., 41 to 49 days between Step 1 and Step 2|% CD3+CD8+ T-cells of Total CD3+ in TIL Infusion Product, The composition of the TIL infusion product was evaluated for the subjects for whom it was possible to grow TILs., 41 to 49 days between Step 1 and Step 2|Objective Response Rate, Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by CT/MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., EoT (Step 2, Week 7) and up to 15 months after EoT.|Clinical Benefit Rate, The clinical benefit rate (CBR) was defined as proportion of subjects who according to RECIST 1.1 had achieved complete response, partial response or stable disease at EoT (Step 2, Week 7) and up to 15 months after EoT.

CBR was evaluated at Step 2, Week 7 and Week 13., Up to 15 months|Best Overall Tumour Response Rate, Best overall tumour response rate (BOR) was defined in the CSP as the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started)., Assessed at Visit 25 (Step 2, Week 7, Day 42)|Progression Free Survival, Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., Days from screening (Baseline) until date of progressive disease or up to 15 months after EoT.
Number of Participants With Tumour-antigen Specific T-cells in Tumour Tissue and Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells, Tumour-antigen Specific T-cells in Tumour Tissue and Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells antigen specificity assessed by enzyme-linked immuno-spot assay (ELISPOT) and flowcytometry analysis of cytokines including interferon gamma (IFNγ) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF⍺), Up to 15 months|Changes in Immunological Parameters From Baseline (Step 1, Week 1, Day 1) to 15 Months After EoT, Systemic immune effect of the treatment was assessed by sequencing the TCR repertoire in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), the TIL product and the biopsies. The outcome of this endpoint is described as the number of subjects for whom a systemic immune effect (in terms of expansion of a significant number of T-cell clones in the blood) was observed., Up to 15 months
Patients with advanced/metastatic tumours who have received at least one approved standard of care treatment will be recruited. All patients must have at least two lesions, one that can injected with LTX-315 and another that can used to assess response. In the first part of the study, LTX-315 will be administered intratumorally on 4-6 dosing days over a 2-4 week period to an index lesion which will be biopsied or removed after treatment for T-cell expansion. The second part will involve culturing and expanding T-cells for infusion of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) following an induction regimen. The safety and efficacy of the LTX-315 and TIL treatment will be assessed. Patients will be followed up for 15 months.
