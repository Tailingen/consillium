Multi-center MRD Registry for Inflammatory Breast Cancer
To collect data from participants with IBC who may have had MRD testing and may have surgery in the future.
Breast Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Quality-of-life Questionnaire
European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30)

Score scale: (1-30 questions to assess the impact of participants quality of life), Through study completion; an average of 1 year
Primary Objectives

-To determine the incidence of protocol specified pre-surgery MRD-positivity in IBC (assessment between completion of planned systemic therapy and surgery).

Secondary Objectives

* To establish the feasibility of multi-institutional MRD data collection using standard of care Signatera analysis in IBC participants.
* To evaluate the association of pre-surgery MRD to pathologic response.
* To evaluate participant reported QOL for worry about recurrence based in participants receiving MRD results
* To establish protocol-optional baseline and longitudinal MRD data collection in IBC participants and report the frequency of MRD longitudinally
* To determine the median lead time between the first MRD-positive result and clinical recurrence.
* To determine whether adjuvant therapies decrease the amount of MRD in participants, and the association with relapse.
