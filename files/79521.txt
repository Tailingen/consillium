Study of AU409 Capsule in Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma Patients Who Failed Standard Treatment
This study is a Phase I, dose-escalation study of AU409 in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma patients who failed standard treatment. A '3+3' dose-escalation design will be utilized to gradually increase the dose of AU409, aiming to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary antitumor efficacy of multi-dose AU409 in patients with advanced HCC.
Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: AU409 capsules
Dose Limiting Toxicity, To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase II dose (R2PD)., At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)
Maximum Tolerated Dose, If 2 or more out of 3 or 6 patients at a dose level develop DLTs, the dose will be considered as "intolerable dose", and the preceding dose level is defined as the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)., Through study completion, an average of 2 years|Recommended Phase 2 Dose, RP2D will be determined in accordance with occurrence of the DLTs and AEs., Through study completion, an average of 2 years|Objective Response Rate, The proportion of patients whose best efficacy is CR and PR observed throughout the study from enrollment to disease progression., Through study completion, an average of 2 years|Disease Control Rate, The proportion of patients whose best efficacy is CR, PR, and SD throughout the study from enrollment to disease progression., Through study completion, an average of 2 years|Duration of Response, The time from the first tumor evaluation as CR or PR to the first evaluation as PD or death from any cause during the study., Through study completion, an average of 2 years|Progression-free Survival, The time from enrollment until the disease progression or death from any cause., Through study completion, an average of 2 years|Overall Survival, The time from enrollment to death from any cause., Through study completion, an average of 2 years
