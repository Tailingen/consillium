First-in-Human Study of the SHP2 Inhibitor BBP-398 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
A first-in-human study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and establish the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of BBP-398, a SHP2 inhibitor, in patients with advanced solid tumors.
Tumor, Solid
DRUG: BBP-398 (Formerly known as IACS-15509)
Determination of Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and establish the RP2D of BBP-398., The MTD will be based on DLT., Completion of 1 Cycle ( 28 days)
Determination of anti-tumor activity of BBP-398, Anti-tumor activity will be defined by objective response rate (ORR2, complete response + partial response rate) and duration of response (DOR3), After 1 dose of BBP-398|Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) of BBP-398, Maximum plasma concentration of BBP-398 after single and multiple dose administration of BBP-398, Approximately 6 weeks|Time to reach Cmax (Tmax) of BBP-398, The amount of time to reach Cmax after single and multiple dose administration of BBP-398, Approximately 6 weeks|Terminal half-life (t1/2) of BBP-398, Terminal half-life (t1/2) after single and multiple dose administration of BBP-398, Approximately 6 weeks|Area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of BBP-398, Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve after single and multiple dose administration of BBP-398, Approximately 6 weeks
The first-in-human (FIH) study of BBP-398 will be an open-label, sequential-cohort, non-randomized, Phase 1/1B study utilizing BOIN dose escalation followed by an expansion phase in patients with MAPK pathway- or RTK-driven advanced solid tumors. The primary objective is to determine safety and tolerability of BBP-398, the MTD and RP2D. The secondary objectives are to assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profile, preliminary anti-tumor activity, objective response rate (ORR, complete response + partial response rate) and the duration of response (DoR) of BBP-398. The exploratory objective is to assess predictive biomarkers of response.
