Zevalin Plus BuCyE High-dose Therapy in B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
In order to improve the clinical result of high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation for B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Zevalin will be added to the conditioning regimen. Investigators expect this radioimmunotherapy of Zevalin plus busulfan, cyclophosphamide and etoposide regimen will improve survival of relapsed or poor-risk B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
DRUG: Zevalin-BuCyE
Event-free survival, Three year event-free survival rate would be reported., the time from stem cell infusion to failure or death from any cause
Overall survival, Three year overall survival would be reported., from stem cell infusion to death of any cause or last follow-up|Toxicity of the treatment combination, Adverse events would be assessed and graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), version 3.0. And the frequency of each grade would be reported as case number and proportion., any toxicity due to study treatment during study period
Title: Combining 90Y-Ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin) with high-dose chemotherapy of BuCyE and autologous stem cell transplantation in patients with relapsed, refractory, or high-risk B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma - an open-labeled phase II study.
