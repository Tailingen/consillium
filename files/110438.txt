A Clinical Study of the Value of Circulating Free Methylated EBV DNA in Extranodal NK/T Cell Lymphoma
This study is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, single-arm clinical study. This study plans to enroll 72 newly diagnosed ENKTCL patients. The enrollment was completed in 2 years, and the follow-up was terminated in 4 years. To observe the accuracy of circulating free methylated EBV DNA in predicting 2-year PFS rate, 2-year OS rate, and CR rate in newly diagnosed ENKTCL patients; and to clarify the prognostic stratification ability of PINK-cpgE compared with PINK-E
