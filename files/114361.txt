A Retrospective Analysis to Evaluate Long Term Outcomes of SCC Patients Previously Treated With Alpha DaRT
Evaluation of long-term efficacy outcomes of patients previously treated with the Alpha DaRT seeds for management of their malignancy following initial response.
Squamous Cell Carcinoma|DaRT Treated Patients
Progression Free Survival (PFS), Time from DaRT insertion to disease progression (according to RECIST V1.1) or death, whichever occurs first, Up to 60 months following DaRT insertion|Adverse Events (AE), Assessment of late onset of Alpha DaRT related AE, Up to 60 months following DaRT insertion
Duration of Response, Time from partial or complete response to the first disease progression according to RECIST V1.1, Up to 60 months following DaRT insertion|Overall Survival (OS), Time from DaRT insertion to death, Up to 60 months following DaRT insertion
Medical records of patients that previously underwent the Alpha DaRT treatment will be reviewed by an authorized staff member.

Evaluation of long-term outcomes of patients previously treated with the Alpha DaRT seeds for management of their malignancy following initial response. These outcomes include:

* Safety - assessment of late onset of Alpha DaRT related AE in patients treated with the Alpha DaRT seeds
* Efficacy -

  * assessment of local recurrence rates in patients who achieved initial complete response (CR) following the Alpha DaRT treatment
  * assessment of duration of response in patients who achieved initial CR following the Alpha DaRT treatment
  * assessment of survival status in patients treated with the Alpha DaRT seeds
