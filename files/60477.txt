Observational Study of Incidence Rates of Esophageal Cancer in Women Taking Medications for the Prevention or Treatment of Osteoporosis (MK-0217A-352)
This is a 2-phase retrospective database study, using both case-cohort and inception (intention-to-treat) cohort analyses to evaluate any association between oral treatments for osteoporosis and the risk of esophageal cancer in women.

Percentage of Participants With Exposure to Study Drugs (Case-Cohort Analysis), To determine the use of study drugs (alendronate, etidronate, ibandronate, risedronate, and raloxifene) among female participants with esophageal cancer (cases) and a comparison subcohort, a case-cohort analysis was performed using women meeting criteria from the General Practice Research Database (GPRD, United Kingdom). Exposure to osteoporosis drugs administered 720 days before cancer onset was determined in cases and compared to contemporaneous assessments in a comparison subcohort matched by year of birth and membership in the GPRD on the case's onset date. Cases were confirmed and case onset dates determined by electronic algorithm (based on electronic medical record data) or by medical record review., Exposure to study drug at least 720 days before disease onset|Number of Cases of Esophageal Cancer Per 100,000 Woman-Years (Intent-to-Treat Analysis), To assess the relative risk of esophageal cancer associated with osteoporosis study drugs (alendronate, etidronate, ibandronate, risedronate, and raloxifene), initiators of osteoporosis drugs and non-initiators (comparators, women sharing match criteria with the initiator) entered an inception cohort for every three-month period, beginning in the first quarter of 1996. Assignment to study drug exposure group remained fixed from the start of follow-up, analogous to an intent-to-treat analysis. The risk of esophageal cancer among initiators of study drug compared to non-initiators of study drug was estimated through calculation of a hazard ratio. For calculation of 721+ day hazard ratios, only esophageal cancer cases occurring at least 721 days from initiation of study drug were used. For calculation of 1441+ day hazard ratios, only esophageal cancer cases occurring at least 1441 days from initiation of study drug were used., Up to approximately 7.3 years of follow-up
