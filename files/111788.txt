An Open-Label, Single Arm Study of Obinutuzumab Short Duration Infusion in Patients With Previously Untreated Advanced Follicular Lymphoma
This open-label, single arm study will evaluate the safety of obinutuzumab administered as a short duration infusion (SDI; target 90-minute infusion) during cycle 2 and from cycle 2 onwards in combination with chemotherapy in participants with previously untreated advanced follicular lymphoma (FL). The study has two phases: in the first phase, participants will receive the first cycle of obinutuzumab-based chemotherapy (G-chemo) induction therapy as usual with the first three infusions of obinutuzumab (1000 mg) administered at the regular infusion rate on Day 1, 8, and 15 of cycle 1. Phase 2 starts when participants who do not experience any Grade ≥ 3 infusion related reactions during the first cycle receive their first obintuzumab infusion given at the faster infusion rate in Cycle 2. For Cycle 2, Day 1 and all other following infusions (including maintenance), obinutuzumab will be administered at a faster infusion of 90-minute SDI, as long as the participant does not experience any Grade ≥ 3 infusion related reactions. The investigator is free to choose the chemotherapy for each participant (bendamustine, CHOP \[cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone/prednisolone/methylprednisolone\], or CVP \[cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone/prednisolone/methylprednisolone\]). The total number of cycles of G-chemo induction therapy and the cycles length depends on the chemotherapy chosen for each participant.

Percentage of Grade >=3 Infusion-Related Reactions (IRRs) During Cycle 2 in Patients Who Had Previously Received Obinutuzumab at the Standard Infusion Rate During Cycle 1 Without Experiencing a Grade 3 or 4 IRR, IRRs were defined as all adverse events (AEs) that occurred during or within 24 hours from the end of study treatment infusion and were judged as related to infusion of study treatment components by the investigator., Within 24 hours from the end of study treatment infusion of Day 1 in Cycle 2 (1 cycle: 21 or 28 days depending on the chemotherapy selected)
Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant who was administered a pharmaceutical product, regardless of causal attribution. An AE was therefore any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Pre-existing conditions which worsened during the study, recurrence of an intermittent medical condition, deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test or were related to a protocol-mandated intervention were also considered AEs. Grading was completed according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 5.0., Baseline up to end of study (approximately 4 years)|Percentage of IRRs Regardless of Grade by Cycle, IRRs were defined as all adverse events (AEs) that occurred during or within 24 hours from the end of study treatment infusion and were judged as related to infusion of study treatment components by the investigator., Within 24 hours from the end of study treatment infusion in all cycles, including maintenance ((1 cycle: 21 or 28 days depending on the chemotherapy selected); up to approximately 2.5 years)|Time to IRR From Infusion to Onset of the IRR During Cycle 2, Time to IRR (of any grade) in Cycle 2 was defined as the time from the start of infusion (i.e., start date/time of infusion of the first component of study treatment) in Cycle 2 to the onset of the IRR (of any grade) during Cycle 2., From infusion to onset of IRR during Cycle 2 (1 cycle: 21 or 28 days depending on the chemotherapy selected)|Duration (In Minutes) of Obinutuzumab Administration by Cycle, The duration of obinutuzumab administration (in minutes) by cycle was defined as the difference between the end time and the start time of obinutuzumab administration., All cycles including maintenance (1 cycle: 21 or 28 days depending on the chemotherapy selected; up to approximately 2.5 years)|Type of Grade >=3 IRRs Associated With the Obinutuzumab Administered as an SDI by Cycle, All cycles including maintenance (1 cycle: 21 or 28 days depending on the chemotherapy selected; up to approximately 2.5 years)|Duration of Grade >=3 IRRs Associated With the Obinutuzumab Administered as an SDI by Cycle, The duration, in minutes, of IRRs during all cycles, where obinutuzumab was administered as an SDI., All cycles including maintenance (1 cycle: 21 or 28 days depending on the chemotherapy selected; up to approximately 2.5 years)|Objective Response Rate (ORR) at the End of Induction (EOI) Therapy, ORR at EOI therapy was defined as the percentage of particpants with either a CR, CR unconfirmed or PR at the EOI visit, as determined by the investigator and according to the guidelines used at the site., Baseline up to end of induction therapy (up to approximately 6 months)|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Rate at the End of the Study, PFS was defined as the time from start of treatment to the first occurrence of disease progression as assessed by the investigator according to the guidelines used at the site or death from any cause., Baseline up to end of study (up to approximately 4 years)|Overall Survival (OS) at the End of the Study, OS was defined as the time from start of treatment (date of first intake of any study treatment component) to death from any cause., Baseline up to end of study (up to approximately 4 years)|Complete Response (CR) Rate at 30 Months (CR30), as Assessed by the Investigator and According to the Guidelines Used at the Site, The CR30 rate was defined as the percentage of participants with a CR at 30 months from study treatment initiation (date of first intake of any study treatment component), as determined by the investigator according to the guidelines used at the site., Baseline up to 30 months
