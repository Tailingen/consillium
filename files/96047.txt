Minimally Invasive Molecular Approaches for the Diagnosis of Barrett's Esophagus and Esophageal Adenocarcinoma
This study will evaluate if the sponge capsule device can accurately detect the presence of Barrett's Esophagus and prevalent dysplasia/adenocarcinoma detection, in a screening population, with and without chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Barrett Esophagus|Esophageal Adenocarcinoma
DEVICE: Sponge Capsule
Aim 1 - Screening Population, To measure the positive and negative predictive value of the sponge capsule Barrett's esophagus test in a screening population., 5 years|Aim 2 - Case/Control Population BE Detection, Compare the sensitivity and specificity of a predetermined BE prediction algorithm for those with and without GERD and assess the influence of other covariates (age, sex, ever smoking, ethnicity and BMI) on this algorithm., 5 years|Aim 3 - Dysplasia Detection Sensitivity and Specificity, Measure the sensitivity and specificity of a predetermined MDM panel assayed on SOS specimens from BE patients identified in Aims 1 and 2, for the detection of HGD /EAC, using surveillance histology as the criterion standard., 5 years
Aim 1 - Screening Population Predictive Value, Compare positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the sponge capsule Barrett's Esophagus test between those with and without chronic GERD., 5 years|Aim 1 - Screening Population Safety and Tolerability of sponge capsule procedure, Safety and tolerability of the sponge capsule device in a screening population as measured by a Tolerability Questionnaire with sponge capsule procedure. Participants will rate their tolerability by rating questions using a scale of 0-10 (0 is none and 10 is severe or 0 is good and 10 is not good)., 5 years|Aim 2 - Case/Control Population Sensitivity and Specificity, Validate specificity and sensitivity cut offs of a BE prediction algorithm in an independent patient cohort, 5 years|Aim 3 - Dysplasia Detection Rate of Missed Dysplasia, Measure diagnostic uncertainty bias in the criterion standard, specifically, the rate of dysplasia missed by surveillance histology, 5 years
The SOS device will be safely administered by a non-physician such as a nurse. Novel discriminant methylated DNA markers will be assayed on esophageal cytology specimens obtained from a sponge on a string (SOS) device to enable detection in Barrett's Esophagus and prevalent dysplasia/adenocarcinoma detection.
