A Phase 2 Study of Isatuximab in Combination With Pomalidomide and Dexamethasone in MM Patients Who Received One Prior Line of Therapy Containing Lenalidomide and a Proteasome Inhibitor
This is an investigator-initiated (IIS), phase 2, prospective, open-label, multinational study, designed to be conducted in approximately 14 sites. Eligible patients will initially receive six 28-day cycles of isatuximab, pomalidomide, and low-dose dexamethasone.

Following this phase:

Patients who achieve ≥VGPR will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive isatuximab, given either Q2W or once monthly, plus pomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone.

Patients with \<VGPR will continue treatment with isatuximab Q2W, pomalidomide, and low-dose dexamethasone.

The study will last for 42 months (recruitment and follow-up period), starting from the date of the first patient in (FPI) to the date of the last patient last visit (LPLV).

Core study procedures consist of baseline and post-baseline safety and disease evaluations, including physical examination, hematologic/clinical chemistry tests, radiologic assessments, bone marrow evaluations, and blood/urine M-protein assessments.

Patients will be allowed to continue treatment until disease progression, death, unacceptable AEs, lost to follow-up, or consent withdrawal.

Overall Response Rate (ORR), The primary endpoint is the ORR after six months of treatment with isatuximab in combination with pomalidomide, and low-dose dexamethasone. ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with stringent complete response (sCR), complete response (CR), VGPR, and partial response (PR), as assessed by the Investigator using the IMWG response criteria., After six months of treatment with isatuximab plus pomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone
Progression-free Survival, Defined as the time from study treatment initiation (Cycle 1 Day 1) to the date of first documentation of progressive disease (PD), as assessed by the Investigator using the IMWG response criteria, or the date of death from any cause, or the initiation of further anti-myeloma treatment, or data cut-off, whichever occurs first., From study treatment initiation to progressive disease (PD), or initiation of further anti-myeloma treatment, or death, whichever occurs first. Maximum time period 42 months.|Overall Survival (OS), Defined as the time from study treatment initiation (Cycle 1 Day 1) to the date of death from any cause. OS will be assessed throughout the treatment period and post EOT during long term follow-up until the end of the study., From study treatment initiation to death. Maximum time period 42 months.|Minimal Residual Response (MRD), Defined as the proportion of patients achieving MRD-negative status, assessed at CR., Through study completion. Maximum time 42 months.|Time to Response (TTR), Defined as the time from study treatment initiation (Cycle 1, Day 1) to the date of the first objective response of PR or better., From study treatment initiation to partial response (PR), or better. Maximum time period 42 months.|Duration of Response (DoR), Defined as the time from the date of the first response, as determined by the Investigator, to the date of the first PD (based on the International Myeloma Working Group \[IMWG\] response criteria) or death, whichever occurs first. DoR will be determined only for patients who have achieved ≥PR., From time response is achieved to progressive disease (PD), or death, whichever comes first. Maximum time period 42 months.|Safety, i.e. Adverse Events (AEs), Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)., Study treatment initiation until 30 days after last study treatment. Maximum time period 42 months.
