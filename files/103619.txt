Dose Escalation Study of BIBW 2992 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
The primary objective was the assessment of safety of BIBW 2992 as assessed by the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Secondary objectives were collection of overall safety data, antitumor efficacy data, as well as the determination of pharmacokinetics and the pharmacodynamic modulation of biomarkers by BIBW 2992.
