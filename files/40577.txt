Safety and Efficacy of (PN-152,243)/PN-196,444 in the Prevention of Thrombocytopenia
Intensive chemotherapy is associated with significant thrombocytopenia, often requiring platelet transfusion to maintain platelet counts. This investigational drug has been demonstrated to increase platelet counts. This study will test the safety and efficacy of the investigational drug in the prevention of thrombocytopenia in patients with recurrent or refractory intermediate-grade or high-grade non-Burkitt's, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), or Hodgkin's disease receiving DHAP (Dexamethasone, high-dose Cytarabine, and Cisplatin) chemotherapy.

DRUG: (PN-152,243)/ PN-196,444
To evaluate the effectiveness of primary prophylaxis with intravenous rhTPO versus placebo in reducing the cumulative proportion of patients who experience severe chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia.
Identify the effect of rhTPO on the number of platelet transfusions|Evaluate the severity and duration of thrombocytopenia and neutropenia associated with rhTPO prophylaxis|Quantify the effect of rhTPO on the occurrence of any bleeding events associated with thrombocytopenia|Assess the likelihood that patients were to have adequate hematologic recovery to allow on-time chemotherapy administration in the subsequent cycles|Assess the safety of multiple IV doses of rhTPO|Determine the occurrence and clinical implications of any anti-TPO antibodies|Assess the antitumor activity of DHAP chemotherapy|Evaluate the impact of rhTPO prophylaxis on health economics/cost effectiveness|Evaluate the impact of rhTPO prophylaxis on patient quality of life
