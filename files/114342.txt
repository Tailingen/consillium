Diagnosis and Survival Prediction of Pancreatic Cancer by Machine Learning of Image Data
This prospective cohort study is designed to investigate the diagnostic ability and prediction accuracy of pancreatic cancer by radiomics data and clinical data.
Pancreatic Cancer
Patient overall survival, Patient overall survival, from the time of diagnosis of pancreatic tumor to the death of the patient., up to 3 years
Pathology diagnosis, Pathology diagnosis of the patient, such as adenocarcinoma, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasm, et al., intraoperative
Progression-free Survival, Patient progression-free survival, the length of time during and after the treatment of the tumor, that a patient lives with the disease but it does not get worse., up to 3 years
In this study, investigators aimed to investigate the diagnostic performance and prediction accuracy of pancreatic cancer by radiomics data and clinical data, which include CT scan, MRI, PET-CT, PET-MR, ultrasound, and clinical data.
