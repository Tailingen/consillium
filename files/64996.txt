Clinical and Immunohisochemical Evaluation of Chemopreventive Effect of Thymoquinone on Oral Potentially Malignant Lesions.
The present randomized, controlled, parallel-grouped trial includes 48 patients (aged 18 to 75 years) suffering from oral potential premalignant lesions. Patients will be randomly assigned into 3 equal groups: Group A: Nigella Sativa buccal tablets group 10mg Group B: Nigella Sativa buccal tablets 5 mg Group C:Control group (placebo)
