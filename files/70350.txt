Study of Imatinib Mesylate in Combination With Hydroxyurea Versus Hydroxyurea Alone as an Oral Therapy in Patients With Temozolomide Resistant Progressive Glioblastoma
This is a Phase III study comparing Imatinib mesylate and hydroxyurea combination therapy with hydroxyurea monotherapy in patients with temozolomide resistant progressive glioblastoma.
Glioblastoma Multiforme|Astrocytoma
DRUG: Imatinib mesylate|DRUG: Hydroxyurea
Percentage of Participants With Progression Free Survival (PFS) During the Study Duration, PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first documented progression according to the MacDonald criteria, or death due to any cause. MacDonald criteria are standard criteria in neurooncology. Tumor assessment was made according to the adapted MacDonald criteria based on the combined evaluation of 1) assessment of the MRI scan for measurable, evaluable, and new lesions (made by the independent external expert too), 2) overall assessment of neurological performance (made by the investigator), 3) concomitant steroid use (as reported by the investigator)., 6 months -1 year
Number of Participants With Death, Other Serious or Clinically Significant Adverse Events (AEs) or Related Discontinuations, National Cancer Institute (NCI)/ National Institute of Health (NIH) provides a grading (severity) scale for each AE term. Grade 3 refers to severe AE and Grade 4 refers to life-threatening or disabling AE. According to FDA 21CFR 314.80, a serious adverse event (SAE) is described as any adverse event that leads to death, is life threatening ( NIH criteria Grade 4), causes or prolongs hospitalization, results in a congenital anomaly, or any other important medical event not described above., 6 months - 1 year
