Molecular Mechanisms of Clinical Resistance to Targeted Therapy Among Patients With Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to learn why certain drugs stop working in patients.In lab studies, tumors become resistant in several ways. Specific molecules seem to change and this may be why therapy stops working. However, we do not know if the same molecules change in patients. This study is being done to see if they do change. If we learn more about how patients become resistant, we may be able to offer better treatment in the future.
