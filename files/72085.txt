MEP and Neuromuscular Blocker
It is important to predict the influence of the neuromuscular blocking agents on the motor evoked potential. Investigator will investigate the dose-response relationship between the degree of the neuromuscular blockade and the motor evoked potential in patients undergoing brain tumor surgery using the population approach. Investigator will investigate the influence of the other factors such as the impedence, reactance, muscel amount, and age on the motor evoked potential.
Brain Tumor
DRUG: Arm I (MEP)
Amplitude of the motor evoked potential, Amplitude of the motor evoked potential will be evaluated at intraoperative 0 h from the start of the anesthetic induction., At intraoperative 0 hr from the start of the anesthetic induction
Amplitude of the motor evoked potential, Amplitude of the motor evoked potential will be evaluated at intraoperative 0 h from the opening of the dura., At intraoperative 0 h from the opening of the dura
