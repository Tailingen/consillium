A Study of Azacitidine and Venetoclax in People With Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
The purpose of this study is to find out if azacitidine and venetoclax are an effective treatment approach to get rid of or lower measurable residual disease (MRD) in people with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who have received standard chemotherapy and are planning to have an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Allogeneic HSCT, sometimes called a bone marrow transplant, involves receiving healthy blood-forming cells (stem cells) from a donor in order to replace the patient's immune system and lower the chances of the disease returning (relapse).
Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
DRUG: Azacitidine (AZC)|DRUG: Venetoclax
rate of MRD conversion, MRD status will be assessed from end-of-cycle bone marrow aspirate, in all patients. MRD will be assessed by flow cytometry (MFC) or by RT-qPCR in molecular patients. This is a dichotomous variable of positive versus negative MRD, with a pre-defined threshold as described above, of 0.1% for MFC or 0.01% in molecular patients ., 1 year
degree of MRD decrease, will be summarized as median and interquartile range., 1 year
