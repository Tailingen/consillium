Specific objectives of this study are the evaluation of:

1. The social, cultural and behavioral factors that impact the uptake of the NCD control services among rural women using the Rapid Assessment, Response and Evaluation (RARE) approach;
2. The feasibility and acceptability of the strategy to deliver the following NCD control services to the rural women at their homes by the trained CHWs:

   * Counselling of the tobacco habitu√©s to give up the practice
   * Early detection of hypertension and diabetes to ensure prompt and regular treatment
   * Creating breast awareness and ensuring access to prompt diagnosis and treatment of the women with symptoms suggestive of breast cancer
   * Screening for cervical cancer by self-collected HPV test and ensuring prompt treatment of screen detected precancers and cancers
   * Screening of the habitual tobacco/alcohol users for oral cancer by OVE and ensuring prompt treatment of screen detected precancers and cancers
