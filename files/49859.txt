A Study of MK-5684 in People With Certain Solid Tumors (MK-5684-015/OMAHA-015)
Researchers want to learn if MK-5684 (the study medicine) can treat breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and endometrial cancer. MK-5684, the study medicine, is designed to treat cancer by blocking the body from making steroid hormones.

Researchers will compare MK-5684 to the standard treatments for each cancer type in this study.

The goal of this study is to learn if people who receive MK-5684 live longer without the cancer growing or spreading compared to people who receive a standard treatment.
Malignant Neoplasm
DRUG: MK-5684|DRUG: Fludrocortisone/ Fludrocortisone acetate|DRUG: Dexamethasone/Dexamethasone acetate|DRUG: Rescue Medications|DRUG: Fulvestrant|DRUG: Exemestane|DRUG: Megestrol acetate/Medroxyprogesterone acetate|DRUG: Tamoxifen|DRUG: Letrozole
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) - All Cohorts, For all cohorts, PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first as assessed by Response Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1). PD is defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD. PFS as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) will be presented., Up to approximately 5 years
Overall Survival (OS) - All Cohorts, For all cohorts, OS is defined the time from randomization to death due to any cause., Up to approximately 5 years|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) - Cohort A, For cohort A (participants with breast cancer), CBR is defined as the percentage of participants who have complete response (CR): disappearance of all target lesions; partial response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions; or stable disease (SD): Neither sufficient decrease to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD), with reference to the smallest sum diameters while on study) for ≥24 weeks per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR., Up to approximately 5 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR) - All Cohorts, For all cohorts, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who have achieved confirmed Complete Response (CR: disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR., Up to approximately 5 years|Duration of Response (DOR) - All Cohorts, For all cohorts, for participants who demonstrate CR or PR, DOR is defined as the time from the first documented evidence of CR or PR until disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 5 years|Number of Participants who Discontinue Study Intervention Due to an Adverse Event (AE) - All Cohorts, An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. An AE could therefore have been any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study intervention., Up to approximately 8 months|Number of Participants who Experience One or More Adverse Events (AEs) - All Cohorts, An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. An AE could therefore have been any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study intervention., Up to approximately 11 months
