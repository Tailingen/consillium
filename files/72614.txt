Necessity of Post-mastectomy Radiotherapy After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy and Mastectomy
Postoperative radiotherapy is generally recommended for patients with breast cancer who have undergone breast-conserving surgery, regardless of prior chemotherapy. However, the criteria for postoperative radiation therapy (PMRT) in patients with breast cancer who have received upfront chemotherapy and mastectomy remain controversial. PMRT is recommended for patients with suspected axillary lymph node metastases before chemotherapy or residual cancer in the axillary lymph nodes after surgery, but this varies by institution and physician. In particular, breast cancer patients with a very good treatment response (pCR or RCB 0-I after prior chemotherapy) have a very good prognosis, and the question of whether PMRT is necessary for these patients continues to be raised. With the addition of new targeted therapies and immuno-oncology agents to conventional chemotherapy, the number of patients with good response is increasing, but there are no prospective studies to date.

The studies that have evaluated the need for PMRT in breast cancer patients with a very good treatment response after upfront chemotherapy and mastectomy are all retrospective studies, lacking evidence to apply to standard of care, and have different definitions of a good treatment response group. Therefore, in this study, the investigators aim to reduce unnecessary overtreatment by comparing survival between PMRT and no PMRT in breast cancer patients with a good response to prior chemotherapy and mastectomy, demonstrating non-inferiority of PMRT to no PMRT. By doing so, the investigators hope to reduce patients' side effects and discomfort, improve their satisfaction and quality of life, and contribute to a new standard of care.

The purpose of this study is to confirm that in patients with breast cancer who have undergone mastectomy after prior neoadjuvant chemotherapy, omitting radiotherapy is non-inferior to post-mastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) in terms of 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with pathologic complete remission and a good response to treatment corresponding to RCB class 0-I, compared to patients treated with PMRT.
Breast Cancer
RADIATION: Arm I (No PMRT)|RADIATION: Arm II (PMRT)
5 year invasive disease free survival (iDFS), Invasive disease-free survival is defined as first invasive recurrence (local, regional, or distant), second invasive cancer (contralateral breast or other cancer), or death from any cause from the date of enrollment., 5 year
Overall survival, 5-year overall survival (OS): Overall survival is defined as the time from subject enrollment to death from any cause., 5 year|Locoregional recurrense free survival, 5-year locoregional recurrence-free interval (LRFI): LRFI is defined as the time of first local recurrence of invasive breast cancer from date of enrollment., 5 year|Distant metastasis free surviva, 5-year distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS): Distant metastasis-free survival is defined as the time from enrollment to the i) first distant metastasis of breast cancer confirmed by imaging (biopsy is performed at the discretion of the investigator). ii) death from breast cancer. iii) death from unknown or non-breast cancer causes., 5 year|Complications of radiotherapy, Information on radiotherapy complications including but not restricted to the following items will be collected and any examinations can be ordered at the discretion of the investigator if a patient presents symptoms:

* Neutropenia
* Cardiac disease: pericarditis, sinus tachycardia, angina, pericardial effusion, tamponade, cardiac enlargement, heart failure etc.
* Pulmonary disease: dry cough, dyspnea, pneumonitis etc.
* Lymphedema of the arm
* Skin symptoms: erythema, edema, ulceration, hemorrhage, necrosis etc.
* Esophageal disease: dysphagia, odynophagia, obstruction, ulceration, perforation, fistula etc., 5 year
