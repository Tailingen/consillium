The Association of MicroRNA21-155 Levels With Acute Side Effects In Patients With Stage III NSCLC With Definitive CRT
The present investigation constitutes a prospective cohort study. The objectives encompass the assessment of miRNA expression levels in total exosomes derived from peripheral circulation tissues of stage III definite KRT NSCLC patients both at the beginning and conclusion of their treatment. Furthermore, an exploration is conducted into the potential correlation existing between alterations in miRNA levels and the incidence of acute treatment-related side effects.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Stage III
To determine the relationship of miRNA levels with acute side effects of chemoradiotherapy, miRNA Expression Measurement: Peripheral blood samples were collected from patients in pre-treatment and post-treatment periods to gauge miRNA expression. Samples were stored under suitable conditions. miRNA-21 and miRNA-155 expression levels were quantified through qRT-PCR. Livak formula-based fold change calculations identified expression shifts from treatment start to end.

Acute Side Effects Assessment:

Acute effects were evaluated as per Cooperative Group Common Toxicity Criteria Acute Side Effects (CTCAE) v5.0. Patients were assessed weekly during treatment and at 1 and 3 months post-treatment, comprehensively analyzing acute effects during treatment., The participants will be followed for an average of six months, including the period from the beginning of the treatment until three months after the completion of the treatment.
Categorical variables were illustrated using both percentage distributions and numerical counts, while continuous variables were characterized using the mean accompanied by the standard deviation, and the median accompanied by the minimum and maximum values. The assessment of the normality of continuous variables encompassed a combination of visual methods such as histograms and probability plots, along with analytical tests like the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests.

In instances where data exhibited a normal distribution, Student's t-test was utilized for comparing two groups. For non-normally distributed data, the Mann-Whitney U test was applied. The comparison of categorical variables between independent groups involved Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests. Changes within dependent groups were evaluated using the Wilcoxon test. When performing pairwise comparisons among three or more groups, p-values were calculated while employing Bonferroni correction.

For the statistical analysis of the research data, the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc. Chicago, USA) was utilized. The significance level was set at p\<0.05. Additionally, it is important to note that p-values falling within the range of 0.1 to 0.05 were considered indicative of a statistical trend in this study.
