Phase I Study of KN044 in Locally Advanced/Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation phase I study to assess the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of KN044 in participants with all advanced solid tumors who are not able to have current standard anti-tumor therapies. The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) , to characterise the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, pharmacodynamics (PD) and anti-tumor activity of KN044 as a single agent in adult participants with advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumors
BIOLOGICAL: KN044
Dose-limiting toxicity for The maximum tolerated dose, Dose-limiting toxicity observation period 6 weeks after the first dose, up to 6 weeks|KN044 of adverse event, the adverse events are recorded according to the actual occurrence, through study completion, an average of 210 days|KN044 of abnormalities of physical findings and laboratory tests,, The data of the clinical research center is collected and analyzed according to the time point of the test flow chart, through study completion, an average of 210 days
PK parameters: Area under curve (AUC), According to the test schedule, the blood volume of each subject's PK was analyzed and PK analysis was performed., an average of 126 days|PK parameters: Cmax, According to the test schedule, the blood volume of each subject's PK was analyzed and PK analysis was performed., an average of 126 days|PK parameters: Clearance rate (CL), According to the test schedule, the blood volume of each subject's PK was analyzed and PK analysis was performed., an average of 126 days|PK parameters: t1/2, According to the test schedule, the blood volume of each subject's PK was analyzed and PK analysis was performed., an average of 126 days|PK parameters: Vss, According to the test schedule, the blood volume of each subject's PK was analyzed and PK analysis was performed., an average of 126 days|PK parameters: dose proportionality, According to the test schedule, the blood volume of each subject's PK was analyzed and PK analysis was performed., an average of 126 days|Incidence of the positive anti-drug antibodies and titers of anti-drug antibodies, According to the test schedule, the blood volume of each subject's anti-drug antibodies was analyzed and anti-drug antibodies analysis was performed., an average of 147 days|Anti-tumor activity as measured by ResponseEvaluationCriteriainSolidTumors Version1.1(RESISTv1.1), Evaluation of tumor response according to RESISTv1.1 criteria, complete relief（CR), Partial relief(PR), Stable disease(SD), PD、ORR\[CR＋PR\]）、Disease control rate(DCR\[CR＋PR＋SD\]）、PFS、DOR, During the treatment period , the tumor was evaluated every 6 weeks, then every 9 weeks.
This study will involve patients and follow the standard "3 + 3"design. KN044 will be antimedical intravenously over 30 minutes with planned doses of 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 6,10 mg/kg Once every 3 weeks for first 4 doses, then every 3, or 6, or 12 weeks for up to 1 year if no intolerable toxicities occur and per agreement with investigator antimedical monitor based on emerging data.
