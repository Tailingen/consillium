Endoscopic Subsurface Optical Imaging for Cancer Detection
The purpose of this pilot study is to develop the methodology for an innovative subsurface imaging technology that was designed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. It will allow the non-invasive analysis and imaging of tissues and chemical distributions in the body at an imaging depth of up to 1 centimeter with spatial resolution on the order of 1 mm.
Bladder Cancer
Accuracy of the subsurface laser to determine cancer cells versus normal cells when viewed endoscopically during a surgical procedure., Does the subsurface laser allow enough light to visually assess the cells. Logical metric of either "Yes" or "No"., 1 year
This is a pilot, feasibility study to determine if the subsurface imaging technology warrants advancement to a larger clinical trial.
