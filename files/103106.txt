A Phase II Clinical Trial of Docetaxel, Oxaliplatin Combination Chemotherapy in Patients With Stage IIIB/IV Non-adenocarcinoma, Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) as Second-line Treatment
1. Goals

   The primary goal of this phase II trial is to:

   evaluate the response rate of combination chemotherapy with docetaxel and oxaliplatin in patients with stage IIIB/IV non-adenocarcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as second-line treatment

   Secondary goals are to:

   evaluate the treatment-related toxicities of this combination, investigate progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in this population
2. Design The proposed clinical trial is an open label, non-comparative, multicenter phase II trial according to the two stage testing design by Simon two-stage testing procedure
