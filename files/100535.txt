Ultrasound Elastography in Patients With Rectal Cancer
The aim of this study is to recruit 50 rectal cancer patients planned to receive standard radiochemotherapy. A baseline ultrasonic elastography is performed prior to radiochemotherapy and followed by re-scans two and six weeks after initiation of treatment. The objective quantitative elastography findings are compared with the TRG score.

The purpose is to elucidate ultrasonic elastography's ability to predict treatment response at an early stage by comparing quantitative ultrasound parameters before, during and after treatment with MR scan results and histopathological Tumor Regression Grade (TRG score) after operation.
