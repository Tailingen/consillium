Exploring Disease Immunogenicity and the Immunological Effects of Hypomethylating Agents in Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This is a multicenter, prospective, translational study, to evaluate the immunogenic profile of AML cases according to immune checkpoint molecule expression.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
GENETIC: Immunogenic profile
Evaluation of the Immunogenic profile of primary or secondary AML patients in according to the variations in expression of molecules involved in immune checkpoint, The immunogenic profile of AML cases obtained by NeoAgprediction will be related with established biological and clinical parameters (including karyotype, percentage of blasts, clinical outcome) performing RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and whole exome sequencing (WES) analysis, up to 30 months
Investigation of the relationship between leukemia immunogenicity and immune checkpoint activation, the relationship between leukemia immunogenicity and immune checkpoint activation through transcriptome analysis of downstream pathways by flow cytometric analysis, up to 30 months|Investigation of the activation of immune checkpoint molecules, Investigation of the activation of immune checkpoint molecules under the selective pressure of hypomethylating agents treatment by gene expression profilling, up to 30 months|The investigation of the association of the immune checkpoint status with clinical outcomes, Investigation of the association of the immune checkpoint status with clinical outcomes (OS, PFS) estimated according to Kaplan-Meier., up to 30 months|The investigation of the association of the immunogenic profile with clinical outcomes, Investigation of the association of the immunogenic profile with clinical outcomes (OS, PFS) estimated according to Kaplan-Meier., up to 30 months
This is a multicenter, prospective, translational study. Pharmacological treatments will not be object of the present study. Patients will follow the prescribed therapeutic indications according to regular clinical practice. Biological samples and clinical data will be collected at fixed timepoints.

Aim of the study is to evaluate the immunogenic profile of AML cases according to immune checkpoint molecule expression.

A total of 75 AML patients affected by primary or secondary AML, at diagnosis ( 45 patients) or relapse (30 patients) will be enrolled in the protocol (18 months for patient enrolment). Blood,BM and saliva samples will be collected from each patients; for patients enrolled at diagnosis, samples will be collected before and after treatment with hypomethylating agents.
