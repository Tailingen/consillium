Bronchoscopic Microwave Ablation of Lung Tissue
The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of the Creo Medical MicroBlate™ Flex AB1 instrument used with the AB1 electrosurgical system in patients undergoing bronchoscopic microwave ablation of peripheral lung nodules.
Lung Cancer
DEVICE: Ablation
Primary Performance (Efficacy) Endpoint, Initial technical success, defined as successful bronchoscopic access by the AB1 instrument of the target tissue, delivery of the scheduled microwave energy to the target tissue and confirmed ablation as evidenced by assessment of CT.

The criterion for meeting the Performance (efficacy) endpoint excludes study system malfunctions., Up to day 30 patient visit.|Primary Safety Endpoint, Identification of serious device-related adverse events related to the use of the AB1 system up to 30 days after the ablation procedure (number and nature of serious adverse events, both device- and procedure- related, will be identified) including, but not limited to:

* Moderate bleeding (intervention required such as use of balloon tamponade or Surgicel) or severe bleeding (prolonged monitoring necessary or fatal bleeding)
* Pneumothorax
* Failure of extubation
* ICU admission for respiratory failure within 30 days
* Death within 30 days., Up to 30 days after the ablation procedure.
Secondary Safety Endpoint, Identification of all device-related, procedure related and other adverse events related to bronchoscopic microwave ablation interventions using the AB1 system., Up to 12 months post ablation.|Secondary Effectiveness Outcomes - Rate of tumor recurrence, Rate of recurrence at all time points as determined by the multidisciplinary team (MDT) or tumour board., Up to 12 months|Secondary Effectiveness Outcomes - European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of life questionnaire - Cancer (EORTC QLQ-C), Patients will rate their responses from 1 to 4 on a Likert Scale (1 being "not at all" and 4 being "very much")., Up to 12 months|Secondary Effectiveness Outcomes - EQ-5D-5L health-related quality of life questionnaire, Patients complete the 5 level descriptive system relating to 5 dimensions of health and the EQ visual analogue scale from 0 to 100 (where 0 means the worst health you can imagine and 100 means the best health you can imagine)., Up to 12 months|Secondary Effectiveness Outcomes - Patient-reported pain rating on a visual analogue scale, Patients will rate their pain on a visual analogue scale from 0 to 10 (where 0 is no pain and 10 is the most severe pain)., Up to 45 days post-ablation|Secondary Effectiveness Outcomes - Assessment/visualization/quantification of the dimensions of the ablated tissue, Dimensions of the ablated tissue to confirm, correct or add to the IFU-reported relationship between AB1 ablation time and dimensions and volume of the ablated tissue, per pre-specified target., Up to 12 months|Secondary Effectiveness Outcomes - Procedural Time, Procedural time to be captured in the electronic case report form (eCRF)., Up to 1 day post ablation procedure.|Secondary Effectiveness Outcomes - Assessment of ease of system use (clinician questionnaires), Questionnaires to be completed by clinicians, rating their responses on a Likert scale of 1 to 7, with 1 being "extremely easy" and 7 being "extremely difficult"., Up to 1 day post ablation procedure.
This is a post-market, prospective, single-arm, multicentre, non-randomized, observational study which will enrol up to 32 subjects in total (plus replacements) at up to 6 clinical investigation sites in Europe and potentially 1 site in the US.

Prospective patients must have a suitable soft tissue lung lesion and be candidates for an elective endobronchial navigation and microwave ablation procedure performed bronchoscopically. After being informed about the study and potential risks, all patients giving their written informed consent will undergo a screening visit to determine eligibility for study entry. Patients who meet the eligibility requirements will undergo a pre-procedural assessment, a bronchoscopy procedure that includes ablation treatment with MicroBlate™ Flex AB1, a post-procedural assessment and 6 follow-up visits at, 7 days (by phone call or in person), 31-45 days, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months.
