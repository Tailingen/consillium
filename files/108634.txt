A Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of Multiple Immunotherapy-Based Treatment Combinations in Patients With Advanced Liver Cancers (Morpheus-Liver)
This is a Phase Ib/II, open-label, multicenter, randomized umbrella study in participants with advanced liver cancers. The study is designed with the flexibility to open new treatment arms as new treatments become available, close existing treatment arms that demonstrate minimal clinical activity or unacceptable toxicity, modify the participant population, or introduce additional cohorts of participants with other types of advanced primary liver cancer.

Cohort 1 will enroll participants with locally advanced or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have not received prior systemic therapy for their disease. Eligible participants will initially be randomly assigned to one of several treatment arms (Stage 1). Participants who experience loss of clinical benefit or unacceptable toxicity during Stage 1 may be eligible to receive treatment with a different treatment combination (Stage 2). When a Stage 2 treatment combination is available, this will be introduced by amending the protocol.

Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR, defined as the proportion of participants with a complete response or partial response on two consecutive occasions \>=4 weeks apart during Stage 1, as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1., From randomization until disease progression or loss of clinical benefit (up to approximately 7-9 years)
Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS after randomization, defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause (whichever occurs first) in Stage 1, as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1., Randomization to first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause in Stage 1 (up to approximately 7-9 years)|Overall Survival (OS), OS after randomization, defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause., Randomization to death from any cause (up to approximately 7-9 years)|OS at Specific Timepoints, OS at a specific timepoint, such as Month 6, Randomization to a specific timepoint, such as Month 6|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR, defined as the time from the first occurrence of a documented objective response to disease progression or death from any cause (whichever occurs first) in Stage 1, as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1., First occurrence of a documented objective response to disease progression or death (up to approximately 7-9 years)|Disease Control, Disease control, defined as stable disease for \>=12 weeks or a complete or partial response, as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1., Randomization to end of study (approximately 7-9 years)|Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events During Stage 1, Baseline through the end of the study (approximately 7-9 years)|Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events During Stage 2, Baseline through the end of the study (approximately 7-9 years)
