About This PDQ Summary
Incidence
Go to Patient Version
Uveal melanoma (iris, ciliary body, choroid) is the most common primary intraocular malignancy. About 2,000 cases of uveal melanoma are diagnosed each year in the United States. It accounts for 5% of all cases of melanoma.[
1
]  This tumor is most commonly diagnosed in older patients, and the incidence peaks at age 70 years.[
2
]
Pediatric uveal melanoma is extremely rare and accounts for 0.8% to 1.1% of all cases of uveal melanoma.[
3
] A retrospective, 24-center, observational study  conducted by the European Ophthalmic Oncology Group from 1968 to 2014 identified 114 children (aged 1–17 years) and 185 young adults (aged 18–25 years) with ocular melanoma.[
3
] The median age at diagnosis for children was 15.1 years. The incidence of disease increased by 0.8% per year between the  ages of 5 and 10 years and 8.8% per year between the ages of 17 and 24 years. Other series have also documented the higher incidence of the disease in adolescents.[

Risk Factors
Risk factors for developing uveal melanoma include the following:[
1
-
3
]
Light eye color.
Fair skin color.
Inability to tan.
Oculodermal melanocytosis.
Presence of cutaneous nevi.
In a European Oncology Group study, 57% of the pediatric patients were female. Four patients had a preexisting condition that included oculodermal melanocytosis (n = 2) and neurofibromatosis (n = 2).[
4
] In a review of 13 cases of uveal melanoma in the first 2 years of life, four patients had familial atypical melanoma mole syndrome, one patient had dysplastic nevus syndrome, and one patient had café au lait spots.[

Molecular Features
Uveal melanoma is characterized by activating variants of
GNAQ
and
GNA11
, which lead to activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathway. In addition, variants in
BAP1
are seen in 84% of metastasizing tumors. Variants in
SF3B1
and
EIF1AX
are associated with a good prognosis.[

Prognostic Factors
Prognostic factors for uveal melanoma include the following:[
1
,
2
]
Tumor size.
Age. In one series, children experienced a lower overall metastatic rate than adults (at both 10 and 20 years).[
1
]
Ciliary body involvement.
Tumor outside the sclera.
Metastasis.
Genetic changes. For more information, see the
Molecular Features
section.
The survival of children appears to be more favorable than that of young adults and adults, suggesting that the biology of ocular melanoma might be different in children.[

A retrospective, multicenter, cohort study identified 133 young children aged 1 to 12 years with choroidal or ciliary body (n = 66; 50%), iris (n = 33; 25%), conjunctival (n = 26; 19%), and eyelid (n = 8; 6%) melanomas.[
3
]
Metastasis was seen in the following:
12% of patients with choroid/ciliary body melanomas (mean follow-up, 74 months).
9% of patients with iris melanomas (mean follow-up, 85 months).
19% of patients with conjunctival melanomas (mean follow-up, 50 months).
13% of patients with eyelid melanomas (mean follow-up, 105 months) (
P
= .65).
Death was reported in the following:
5% of patients with choroid/ciliary body melanomas.
3% of patients with iris melanomas.
8% of patients with conjunctival melanomas.
0% of patients with eyelid melanomas.

Special Considerations for the Treatment of Children With Cancer
Cancer in children and adolescents is rare, although the overall incidence has slowly increased since 1975.[
1
]    Children and adolescents with cancer should be referred to medical centers that have a multidisciplinary team of cancer specialists with experience treating the cancers that occur during childhood and adolescence.  This multidisciplinary team approach incorporates the skills
of the following pediatric specialists and others to ensure that children receive treatment, supportive care, and rehabilitation
to achieve optimal survival and quality of life:
Primary care physicians.
Pediatric surgeons.
Pathologists.
Pediatric radiation
oncologists.
Pediatric medical oncologists and hematologists.
Ophthalmologists.
Rehabilitation
specialists.
Pediatric oncology nurses.
Social workers.
Child-life professionals.
Psychologists.
Nutritionists.
For specific information about supportive care for children and adolescents with cancer, see the summaries on
Supportive and Palliative Care
.
The American Academy of Pediatrics has outlined guidelines for
pediatric cancer centers and their role in the treatment of children and adolescents
with cancer.[
2
]  At
these centers, clinical trials are available for most  types of cancer that occur in children and adolescents, and the opportunity
to participate is offered to most patients and their families.  Clinical
trials for children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer are generally
designed to compare potentially better therapy with current standard therapy. Other types of clinical trials test novel therapies when there is no standard therapy for a cancer diagnosis.  Most of the progress in identifying curative
therapies for childhood cancers has been achieved through clinical trials. 
Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the
NCI website
.
Dramatic improvements in survival have been achieved for children and adolescents with cancer. Between 1975 and 2020, childhood cancer mortality decreased by more than 50%.[

5
]  Childhood and adolescent cancer survivors require close monitoring because side effects of cancer therapy may persist or develop months or years after treatment.  For information about the incidence, type, and monitoring of late effects in childhood and adolescent cancer survivors, see
Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer
.
Childhood cancer is a rare disease, with about 15,000 cases diagnosed annually in the United States in individuals younger than 20 years.[
6
] The U.S.
Rare Diseases Act of 2002
defines a rare disease as one that affects populations smaller than 200,000 people in the United States. Therefore, all pediatric cancers are considered rare.
The designation of a rare tumor is not uniform among pediatric and adult groups. In adults, rare cancers are defined as those with an annual incidence of fewer than six cases per 100,000 people. They account for up to 24% of all cancers diagnosed in the European Union and about 20% of all cancers diagnosed in the United States.[
7
,
8
] In children and adolescents, the designation of a rare tumor is not uniform among international groups, as follows:
A consensus effort between the European Union Joint Action on Rare Cancers and the European Cooperative Study Group for Rare Pediatric Cancers estimated that 11% of all cancers in patients younger than 20 years could be categorized as very rare. This consensus group defined very rare cancers as those with annual incidences of fewer than two cases per 1 million people. However, three additional histologies (thyroid carcinoma, melanoma, and testicular cancer) with incidences of more than two cases per 1 million people were also included  in the very rare group due to a lack of knowledge and expertise in the management of these tumors.[
9
]
The Children's Oncology Group defines rare pediatric cancers as those listed in the International Classification of Childhood Cancer subgroup XI, which includes thyroid cancers, melanomas and nonmelanoma skin cancers, and multiple types of carcinomas (e.g., adrenocortical carcinomas, nasopharyngeal carcinomas, and most adult-type carcinomas such as breast cancers and colorectal cancers).[
10
]  These diagnoses account for about 5% of the cancers diagnosed in children aged 0 to 14 years and about 27% of the cancers diagnosed in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years.[
4
]
Most cancers in subgroup XI are either melanomas or thyroid cancers, with other cancer types accounting for only 2% of the cancers diagnosed in children aged 0 to 14 years and 9.3% of the cancers diagnosed in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years.
These rare cancers are extremely challenging to study because of the relatively few patients with any individual diagnosis, the predominance of rare cancers in the adolescent population, and the small number of clinical trials for adolescents with rare cancers.
Information about these tumors may also be found in sources relevant to
adults with cancer, such as
Intraocular (Uveal) Melanoma Treatment

Treatment and Outcome of Childhood Intraocular (Uveal) Melanoma
Treatment options for childhood intraocular (uveal) melanoma include the following:
Surgery.
Radiation therapy.
Laser surgery.[
1
,
2
]
Bispecific fusion proteins (tebentafusp).
A retrospective single-institution review identified 18 patients younger than 21 years with uveal melanoma.[
3
][
Level of evidence C1
]  Patients were treated with enucleation (n = 9), transscleral en bloc resection (n = 3), plaque radiation therapy (n = 5), or proton-beam radiation therapy (n = 1).
Eight of these patients (44%) developed metastatic disease, all of whom died of their disease. The median survival time after detection of metastasis was 2.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.0–5.2 months).
The median overall survival (OS) of the 18 patients after treatment of the primary intraocular tumors was 11.9 years (95% CI, 7.3–16.5 years).
Laser surgery has been used to treat childhood intraocular melanoma.[

,
2
]
An open-label, randomized, phase III trial  of adult patients with previously untreated HLA-A*02:01–positive metastatic uveal melanoma investigated treatment with  tebentafusp.  Tebentafusp is a bispecific restricted T-cell receptor for the glycoprotein 100 peptide; it is fused to a CD3 single-chain variable fragment. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either tebentafusp or treatment according to the investigator's choice.[
4
]
Patients who received tebentafusp had an OS rate of 73%, compared with 50% for patients in the control group (hazard ratio [HR] for death, 0.51;
P
< .001).
The progression-free survival rate was also significantly higher for the tebentafusp group (31% vs. 16% at 6 months; HR for progression or death, 0.71;
P
= .01).
The most common toxicities for patients who received tebentafusp were cytokine release syndrome, mostly grades 1 and 2, and rash.
