PROSPECT-C: A Study of Biomarkers of Response or Resistance to Anti-EGFR Therapies in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
PROSPECT-C is a phase II study investigating the molecular markers of response or resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Cetuximab
Track and validate specific known mechanisms of resistance/response to anti-EGFR therapies through, digital droplet polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) and ultra deep next generation sequencing (NGS) analyses of circulating tumour deoxyribonucleic acid (ct-DNA) obtained every 4 weeks during the course of treatment. Mutations found in ctDNA will also be analysed in the archival and fresh tissue specimens, used for diagnostic testing and obtained during the study respectively, 3-4 years
Identify novel biomarkers of resistance to anti-EGFR therapies through whole exome sequencing, DNA extracted from pre- and post-treatment metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) biopsies; Ultra deep targeted sequencing of tumour samples and of ctDNA will be used to assess whether the identified resistance biomarkers are detectable in some patients before treatment initiation and whether this correlates with short progression free survival (PFS) and poor radiological response, 3-4 years
Cetuximab or panitumumab are two monoclonal antibodies that are routinely offered to patients with metastatic colorectal cancer when they have no mutation in RAS genes. In Royal Marsden Hospital patients, who are refractory to all standard therapies and have metastatic colorectal cancer are offered one of these agents in third line metastatic setting. Whilst the mechanisms of response/resistance to these therapies are well studies, they are still incompletely understood. The main hypothesis of this study is that finding mechanisms of response and/or resistance by using novel techniques such as next generation sequencing (NGS) and/or digital droplet polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) to these therapies will allow better patient selection and application of precision medicine in such patients.
