Detection and Quant of Differences in Hodgkin Lymphoma and Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma Using Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT)
RATIONALE: Imaging procedures, such as positron emission tomography or computed tomography, may help in detecting differences between Hodgkin lymphoma or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cancer cells. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying positron emission tomogaphy and computed tomography in determining differences in Hodgkin lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
Lymphoma
RADIATION: Fludeoxyglucose F18|PROCEDURE: Computed Tomography|PROCEDURE: Positron emission tomography
Percentage Change in Maximum Lesional FDG Uptake From 60 to 180 Minutes After FDG Administration, Lesional fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake is measured by standardized uptake value (SUV). The study compared the percentage of change in maximum SUV over 2 hours (first measure was 60 minutes post-administration and second timepoint was 180 minutes post-administration)., 2 hours (between 60 minutes post-administration and 180 minutes post-administration)
OBJECTIVES:

I. Assess the feasibility of detection and quantification of differences in the temporal and spatial distribution of FDG uptake between lesions of HL and DLBCL.

OUTLINE:

Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F18 (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography scans 60 and 180 minutes after FDG administration.

After completion of study, patients are followed for 24 hours.
