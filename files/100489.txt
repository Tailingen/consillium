QUILT-2.017: Phase 1b/2 Study of AMG 479 in Combination With Paclitaxel and Carboplatin for 1st Line Treatment of Advanced Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a global, multicenter, 2-part, open-label phase 1b and single-arm phase 2 study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AMG 479 in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin for the first-line treatment of advanced squamous non-small cell lung carcinoma.
Advanced Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: AMG 479|BIOLOGICAL: AMG 479|DRUG: Carboplatin|BIOLOGICAL: AMG 479|DRUG: Paclitaxel
Part 1: Number of Dose Limiting Toxicities, DLTs were defined as grade 3 or higher hematological or nonhematological toxicities that, in the opinion of the investigator, were related to ganitumab or the combination of ganitumab and paclitaxel or carboplatin during this period. These did not include fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, hyperglycemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, lymphopenia, alopecia, increased ALT or AST, or pulmonary embolism unless they met certain criteria., Part 1 only up to 21 days|Part 2: Objective Response Rate, Part 2: Objective Response Rate as per modified RECIST criteria by investigator review Objective response was defined as a tumor response assessment of either complete response or partial response per modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors \[RECIST\] and was determined only for subjects with measurable disease at baseline. Per RECIST: a complete response is the disappearance of all target lesions; a partial response is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., From start of treatment up to approximately 16 months
Number of Participants With Adverse Events, Adverse events were assessed using CTCAE v 3.0, 30 days after last dose, up to 5 months|Number of Participants With Anti-AMG 479 Antibody Formation, From start of treatment up to approximately 16 months|Progression Free Survival, PFS was defined as the time from study day 1 to the first observation of disease progression per investigator review (as classified by modified RECIST or death due to any cause, or censoring. Disease progression per RECIST is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions in reference to the smallest sum on study and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm; the appearance of any new lesions is also considered progression., From start of treatment up to approximately 16 months|Time to Progression and Duration of Response, Time to Progression (TTP) is defined as the time from Day 1 to the first observation of disease progression (per modified RECIST). Disease progression per RECIST is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions in reference to the smallest sum on study and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm; the appearance of any new lesions is also considered progression. DOR was the time from the first observation of an objective response to the subsequent time of disease progression (per modified RECIST or clinical progression, whichever came first) or death due to any cause. Objective response = a tumor response assessment of either complete response or partial response per modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors \[RECIST\]. Per RECIST: a complete response is the disappearance of all target lesions; a partial response is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., From start of treatment up to approximately 16 months
