Immunotherapy With CD19 CART-cells for B Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
This study aims to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of CD19 Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) redirected autologous T-cells in treating patients with recurrent or refractory CD19 positive B cell ccute lymphoblastic leukemia,and dynamically observe the changes of CAR-T in patients and the residual tumor.
Leukemia, B-Cell
BIOLOGICAL: CD19-targeted CART cells
overall response rate(ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of partial responses plus complete responses., Participants will be followed for the duration of the treatment, with an expected average of 3 months.
Progression free survival(PFS), Progression-free survival is defined as the time from enrollment to first observation of progression or date of death (from any cause)., 15 years|Overall survival(OS), Overall survival, defined as the time from enrollment until death due to any cause. For patients who do not die, time to death will be censored at the time of last contact., 15 years
In this single-center, open-label, single-arm, prospective clinical trial, a total of 20 recurrent or refractory CD19+ B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients will be enrolled.After recruiting eligible patients,autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMCs) will be purified from whole blood.The CD3+ T cells were subsequently selected and re-stimulated by anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 monoclonal antibodies.T cells will be transduced with lentiviral vector for the generation of the CD19 CART cell and administered by i.v. injection.The purpose of current study is to determine the safety and clinical efficacy of CD19 CAR T cells therapy in patients with recurrent or refractory CD19+ ALL.
