Thermal Spread Into the Interstitial Portion of the Fallopian Tubes Using the Ligasure Device at Time of Hysterectomy
Some patients, specifically those with a diagnosed genetic mutation, will have their ovaries and fallopian tubes removed without removal of the uterus in an attempt to prevent ovarian and fallopian tube cancer from developing.

Anatomically the fallopian tubes are attached to the uterus and extend towards the ovaries. The fallopian tube tissue arises within the corner area of the uterus and occupies about 1cm of the uterine muscle wall.

The purpose of this study is to determine if the technique used to remove fallopian tubes only (without removal of the uterus) adequately removes or destroys all the fallopian tube cells that remain in the uterine muscle wall.

Currently, during the operation an instrument is used that burns the fallopian tube and allows it to be cut away from the uterus. The investigators do not know if this procedure successfully destroys all the fallopian tube cells within the uterus. Therefore, we will compare this single step procedure to a two step procedure. The two step procedure is to burn and cut the fallopian tube followed by an additional burning step, called cauterization at the top of the uterus. The investigators will assess if either or both of these procedures destroy the fallopian tube cells that may remain inside the uterine wall. This is important to determine since the goal is to remove the ovaries and all of the fallopian tubes in order to prevent future development of ovarian or fallopian tube cancer.

DEVICE: LigaSure vessel sealing system
To Determine if the LigaSure Device, Which we Routinely Used for Removal of Tubes and Ovaries, is Effective at Destroying All Tubal Cells Comprising the Fallopian Tube Including Those Cells Within the Cornua of the Uterus., conclusion of the study
