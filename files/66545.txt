Dose Escalation Study to Evaluate Safety and Tolerability of an Allogeneic Tumor Vaccine BIWB 2 in Patients With Advanced Malignant Melanoma
Evaluation of safety and tolerability of four intradermal injections given at two week intervals. In addition the efficacy of transferrinfection was determined by quantifying Interleukin 2 (IL-2), which was locally produced by the implanted, transfected allogenic melanoma cells at the injection sites. Further determination of tumor specific and clinical host responses induced or augmented by the treatment were determined.
