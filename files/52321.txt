Brain Neoplasm|Brain Metastases|Glioma|Meningioma
PROCEDURE: Cryoablation of brain neoplasm
Safety: Incidence and Severity of Complications and Morbidity During the Study Period, Complications \& morbidity during the entire study period as decided by the treating physician. Severity and frequency of the following complications:

* Postoperative intracranial bleeding
* Wound infection
* Epilepsy
* Brain edema
* Neurological deficit (paresis/plegia)
* Aphasia
* Death, From enrollment to the end of the study, with a minimum follow-up of 3 months. Complications such as bleeding, infection, epilepsy, brain edema, neurological deficit, and death will be evaluated, with safety assessed up to 12 months post-surgery.|Feasibility Evaluation in Operation Time, Descriptive:

Operation time (in minutes), From start to end of the procedure, measured in minutes.|Feasibility Evaluation in Blood Loss, Descriptive:

Blood loss during intervention (in milliliters), From start to end of the cryoablation procedure, measured in milliliters.
Assessment of Tumor Cell Ablation: percentage of patients with total resections, The percentage of patients with total resections (percentage of patients who undergo a complete tumor resection)., For progression-free survival and overall survival, the time frame is defined as the period from the date of enrollment to 3 months after enrollment, with a minimum follow-up of 3 months.|Assessment of Progression-Free Survival, Progression-free survival (PFS) per patient, measured from the date of enrollment to 3 months after enrollment, assessed for disease progression or death., From enrollment to 3 months after enrollment, with a minimum follow-up of 3 months.|Assessment of Overall Survival, Overall Survival (OS) per patient type at 3 months, measured from the date of enrollment to 3 months after enrollment, assessed for survival (alive or deceased), From enrollment to 3 months after enrollment, with a minimum follow-up of 3 months.
Cryoablation is a therapeutic modality that employs extreme cold to induce cell necrosis in tumor tissue. While the application of cryoablation for the treatment of brain tumors remains under investigation, it has been extensively utilized in other organ systems with outcomes often surpassing those of conventional therapies.

The primary objective of this research is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of cryoablation as a treatment option for patients diagnosed with various brain tumors, including gliomas, meningiomas, and metastatic lesions. Participants enrolled in this study will first undergo standard surgical resection of the brain tumor. Prior to resection, a biopsy of the tumor will be performed to obtain a histopathological diagnosis, ensuring accurate characterization of the tumor type.

Subsequently, the tumor will undergo cryoablation utilizing cryoprobes, with a maximum of two cycles of up to 10 minutes each. The specific number and diameter of cryoprobes used will be determined by the tumor's size, aiming to achieve optimal ablation coverage. Following the removal of the cryoprobes, the tumor will be resected, and standard craniotomy closure procedures will be implemented. Patients will receive standardized postoperative care tailored to their clinical needs.

The follow-up period for this study will extend up to three months following the completion of treatment for the last enrolled participant, allowing for comprehensive assessment of treatment outcomes and safety profiles.
