Comparison of HBV Reactivation Between Patients With High HBV-DNA and Low HBV-DNA Loads Undergoing ICI and Concurrent Antiviral Prophylaxis: a Prospective Observational Study
Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI), including programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) inhibitor or programmed cell death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor , is recommended to treat advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the safety of ICI in patients with a high HBV-DNA load is unknown because of the potential risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation. This study was to compare the HBV reactivation between patients with low HBV-DNA loads and high HBV-DNA loads undergoing antiviral prophylaxis and ICI.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: ICI|DRUG: Antiviral Prophylaxis
HBV Reactivation rate, HBV Reactivation rate was defined as one of the following according to the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) 2018 hepatitis B guidelines: (i) a ≥2 log (100-fold) increase in HBV DNA compared to the baseline level, (ii) HBV DNA ≥3 log (1,000) IU/mL in a patient with previously undetectable level (since HBV DNA levels fluctuate), 2 months
HBV-associated hepatitis, HBV-associated hepatitis was defined as HBV Reactivation plus an ALT increase to ≥3 times the baseline level and \>100 U/L according to the AASLD 2018 Hepatitis B Guidance, 2 months|PD-1 inhibitor disruption due to hepatitis, PD-1 inhibitor disruption due to hepatitis was defined as either premature termination or a delay of at least 7 days between PD-1 inhibitor cycles because of hepatitis., 2 months|overall survival, 12 months|adverse event, 30 Days after ICI
