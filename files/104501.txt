Study of Proteins in Tumor Samples From Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This research studies protein in tumor samples from patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Finding specific proteins in tumor tissue samples from patients with cancer may help doctors tell what type of lung cancer a patient has and plan better treatment.
Lung Cancer
OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis
Validation of a novel 4-protein signature's ability to subtype NSCLC, 1 month
NSCLC misclassification rate, 1 month
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To validate a novel 4-protein signature's ability to subtype non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in a treatment-naive, multi-institutional cohort, Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 9761.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To estimate the NSCLC misclassification rate in a multi-institutional clinical-trial setting for stage 1 NSCLC (adenocarcinoma versus squamous cell).

OUTLINE:

Previously collected tissue samples are analyzed via hematoxylin and eosin (H\&E) staining and immunohistochemistry (IHC).
