Combination of Regorafenib and Nivolumab in Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Regorafenib and nivolumab are proven effective agents for the management of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma patients. As preclinical studies have suggested potential synergism between antiangiogenic agents and immune checkpoint inhibitors, regorafenib and nivolumab may have synergism in terms of efficacy. Herein, this study investigates the combination of regorafenib and nivolumab as first-line therapy in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.
