A Phase I Clinical Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of Anti-PD-1 Antibody (HLX10) in Combination With Avastin Biosimilar (HLX04) in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a single-center, open-label, dose-escalation Phase I clinical trial to evaluate the safety and the tolerability of HLX10-HLX04 combination therapy in patients with advanced solid tumors after failure of standard of care.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: HLX04|DRUG: HLX10
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of HLX04 plus HLX10 in patients with advanced solid tumors, The MTD is the dose with toxicity rate (estimated by isotonic regression) most approximate to the target one (30%)., 28 days|Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) of HLX04 plus HLX10 in patients with advanced solid tumors, DLT is defined as the occurrence of the following adverse events (unless judged by the investigator to be definitely unrelated to HLX04 or HLX10) within Cycle 1 (i.e., from Cycle 1 Day 1 to Cycle 1 Day 28), 28 days
PK parameters of the HLX04 plus HLX10 therapy in patients with advanced solid tumors, Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax) for single dose and multiple doses, Day 1 of treatment up to 2 years|PK parameters of the HLX04 plus HLX10 therapy in patients with advanced solid tumors, Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) for single dose and multiple doses, Day 1 of treatment up to 2 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR) of HLX04 plus HLX10 in patients with advanced solid tumors, ORR determined by RECIST criteria, Day 1 of treatment up to 2 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR) of HLX04 plus HLX10 in patients with advanced solid tumors, DCR determined by RECIST criteria, Day 1 of treatment up to 2 years|Duration of Response (DOR) of HLX04 plus HLX10 in patients with advanced solid tumors, DOR determined by RECIST criteria, Day 1 of treatment up to 2 years|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) of HLX04 plus HLX10 in patients with advanced solid tumors, PFS determined by RECIST criteria, Day 1 of treatment up to 2 years|Overall Survival (OS) of HLX04 plus HLX10 in patients with advanced solid tumors, OS determined by RECIST criteria, Day 1 of treatment up to 2 years|Immunogenicity, Anti-drug Antibody (ADA) Testing, Day 1 of treatment up to 2 years
