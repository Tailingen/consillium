Tislelizumab Combined Treatment in Refractory Extranodal NK/T-cell Lymphoma
Natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (NKTCL) patients with relapsed/refractory disease had very poor outcome. Anti-PD-1 antibody showed promising results in response, but but the complete remission rate of was low. Some anti-PD-1 antibody based regimen showed higher and deeper response in NKTCL patients.
Natural Killer/T-Cell Lymphoma, Nasal and Nasal-Type
DRUG: tislelizumab, azacytidine, lenalidomide|DRUG: tislelizumab, etoposide, pegaspargase
Overall response rate, The overall response rate will be assessed on Week 12, Week 12 +/-7 days
Complete response rate, The complete response rate will be assessed on Week 12, Week 12 +/-7 days|Progression free survival, Progression free survival is the time from entry onto the treatment until lymphoma progression or death of any reason., 1-year|Overall survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from entry onto the treatment until death of any reason, 1-year|Treatment-Related Adverse Events as Assessed by CTCAE v5.0, From day 1 of each course of chemotherapy to the 3 months after the last dose of therapy, Treatment-Related Adverse Events will be assessed and graded by NCI CTCAE v5.0.
About 20-30% of early-stage patients and 40-60% of late-stage NKTCL patients will experience disease relapse and refractory disease, and the median survival time of relapsed patients is about 6 months. PD-1 antibody is an effective drug for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory NKTCL, but the response rate and complete remission rate of monotherapy are low. How to improve the prognosis of patients is an important way to try combination therapy. In this study, we aim to explore the effectiveness and safety of a novel anti-PD-1 antibody, tislelizumab, in combination with different drugs (tislelizumab plus azacytidine and lenalidomide, or tislelizumab plus etoposide and pegaspargase) to treat refractory NK/T.
