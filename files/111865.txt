A Study of Durvalumab in Patients With BR PDA Following Neoadjuvant Therapy and Successful Surgical Resection
This is a two-arm, open-label, phase II study of in adult patients who have successfully undergone R0/R1 resection of PDAs following neoadjuvant chemotherapy and completion of adjuvant chemotherapy. Within 1-3 months of treatment completion, patients will be enrolled and randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive durvalumab versus observation.
Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: Durvalumab
The number of subjects with disease free survival (DFS), Disease free survival (DFS) is defined as the time from randomization to the first of either disease recurrence or death from any cause., 26 Months
Overall survival (OS) of all patients, OS is defined as the time from study enrollment to death from any cause., 26 months|The number of patients who experience adverse events, Adverse events are measured by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.03)., 26 months
Borderline resectable pancreatic cancer (BRPC) patients who have successfully underwent R0/R1 resection of PDAs following neoadjuvant chemotherapy, between 1-3 months after the completion of planned adjuvant chemotherapy will be enrolled and randomized at a 1:1 ratio into two arms (56 per arm). Patients in Arm A will be given anti-PD-L1 antibody, durvalumab, every 2 weeks for a maximum of 26 doses if there is no radiographic evidence of disease recurrence. Patients in Arm B will be observed. Blood draws for immune monitoring and serum banking will be collected at the following time points:

Arm A - before Cycles 1, 2, 4, 7 and End of Treatment (EOT) visit; Arm B - before Cycles 1, 4, 7, and End of Treatment (EOT) visit
