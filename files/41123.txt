Recurrent High Grade Glioma Treated by LITT
This clinical trial aims to investigate the efficiency and safety of laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) in recurrent high-grade glioma (rHGG) patients.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

* The LITT would increase the progression-free survival and overall survival of rHGG patients compared to other treatments.
* The LITT is safe and applicable to rHGG patients Participants will be randomized to the intervention group (LITT) or control group at a ratio of 2:1. The intervention group patients will receive LITT. The control group will be treated with any other treatment.

The primary outcome of this trial is progression-free survival. The estimated sample size is 135, 90 in the LITT group and 45 in the control group.
Recurrent High Grade Glioma
DEVICE: LITT|OTHER: Control
Progression-free survival, The progression was defined by RANO 2.0 criteria and assessed by the third-party clinical events committees which are blinded to the allocation., estimate 6 months
Lesion ablation rate, LITT group only, measured on enhanced MRI within 2 days post LITT, within 2 days Post LITT|Lesion remaining volume, LITT group only, measured on enhanced MRI within 2 days post LITT, within 2 days Post LITT|Overall survival, up to 2 years|Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) shift, The difference between baseline KPS and follow-up KPS, Day 30,Day 90, Day 180
specific AE rate, Specific AE and complication including intracerebral hemorrhage, severe edema, newly seizure, local incision wound and all SAEs, through study completion, an average of 6 month|bleeding volume, LITT group only during surgery, post LITT immmediatly
