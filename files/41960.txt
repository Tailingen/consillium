Drug Screening of Pancreatic Cancer Organoids Developed From EUS-FNA Guided Biopsy Tissues
We are going to establish "organoid" models from pancreatic cancer biopsies achieved via EUS-FNA. Then the sensitivity of the selected FDA-approved anti-cancer drugs will be tested in these organoids.
Pancreatic Cancer|Pancreas Adenocarcinoma
PROCEDURE: Biopsy
Number of organoids successfully generated from pancreatic cancer biopsies, Successful isolation of pancreatic cancer organoids within 2 weeks of EUS-FNA operation will be defined as successful establishment of an organoid. We will calculate the total number of organoids generated in our center., 09/01/2018-06/01/2019
Response of the pancreatic cancer organoids to the selected anti-cancer drugs, We will treat the established organoids with the selected FDA-approved drugs. Then the anti-cancer activity of these drugs will be tested using CellTiter-Glo 3D Cell Viability Assay (Promega)., 06/01/2019-06/01/2020
The survival rate of pancreatic cancer, a kind of malignant tumor, remains poor due to lack of effective treatments. Recently, a new model called "organoid" has been generated from human and murine pancreatic cancer tissues. These organoids are developed from large pieces of surgical tissues or small biopsies taken from EUS-FNA guided samples. Here in our study we are going to establish "organoid" models from pancreatic cancer biopsies achieved via EUS-FNA. After successful generation of these organoids, we will treat them with the selected FDA-approved anti-cancer drugs, and assess the responses to these anti-cancer agents in our established organoids.
