Myelodysplasia|Leukemia
DRUG: chemotherapy
Response Rate, Complete Response/Complete Remission:

Complete remission (CR) is defined as the presence of all of the following:

* Peripheral blood - No leukemic blasts present.
* No extramedullary findings of leukemia or disappearance of such (i.e. CNS or soft tissue involvement)
* Bone marrow
* No Auer rods
* Less than 5% blast cells.
* CBC and bone marrow criteria must be met within one week of each other.
* Hemoglobin 9g/dl or greater
* Neutrophil count \>1000 and platelet count \>100,000.
* RBC Transfusion free for 2 weeks., within 30 days of last treatment
The primary objective of this study is to determine the feasibility and toxicity of decitabine, ARA-C and G-CSF for patients with myelodysplasia, refractory acute leukemia and poor performance status acute leukemia.
