Pilot Study of Cabozantinib for Recurrent or Progressive Central Nervous System Tumors in Children
This pilot will study the feasibility and exploratory efficacy of using Cabozantinib for recurrent or refractory central nervous system tumors for which there are no curative options. Patients will also be followed for safety, time to progression, event free survival and overall survival
Glioblastoma Multiforme|Anaplastic Astrocytoma|Malignant Brain Tumor|High Grade Glioma
DRUG: Cabozantinib
Number of Participants With Disease Response, To assess the number of participants with best response of CR, PR, SD or PD. Response criteria are assessed based on the product of the longest diameter and its longest perpendicular diameter.

Complete response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions Partial response (PR): â‰¥50% decrease in the sum of the products of the two perpendicular diameters of all target lesions (up to 5), taking as reference the initial baseline measurements Stable disease (SD): Neither sufficient decrease in the sum of the products of the two perpendicular diameters of all target lesions to qualify for PR, nor sufficient increase in a single target lesion to qualify for PD.

Progressive Disease (PD): The appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions., 6 months
Overall Survival, To assess the number of participants who survived at 6 months., 6 months|Number of Participants With Progression Free Survival, To assess the number of participants who had progression free survival at 6 months., 6 months
