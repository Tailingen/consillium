Evaluation and Comparison of the Growth Rate of Pancreatic Cancer Patient-derived Organoids
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most aggressive forms of cancer. Despite advances in the understanding of the mechanisms underlying PDAC pathogenesis, the impact on patient benefit is lagging. As a result, new model systems are being developed and used to fill this gap with the hope of translation into improved diagnostics and therapeutics.

Organoids represent a powerful tool for research with the capacity to be applied to many key aspects of pancreatic tissue pathology.

3D organoids can be generated from endoscopic fine-needle aspiration or fine needle biopsy samples. In this study, we will evaluate and compare the growth rate of pancreatic cancer patient-derived organoids generated from matched fine needle Aspirations (FNA) and fine needle biopsies (FNB).
Pancreas Cancer
PROCEDURE: FNA, FNB
Growth rate, Organoid growth will be determined using bi-weekly measurements by phase-contrast microscopy calculating the total organoid area as well as individual organoid size. In addition, growth rates will be determined using the cell glow assay (Promega) over a time-course of 4 days. Furthermore, the mean passaging time will be calculated after 5 passages., 4 days
