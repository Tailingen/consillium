Re-treatment Safety of Radium-223 Dichloride in Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer With Bone Metastases
Eligible subjects must have completed 6 doses of treatment of radium-223 dichloride and experienced no radium-223 dichloride-related SAEs (serious adverse events) or CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) Grade 3 or 4 adverse event during or after the initial course of radium-223 dichloride that led to the discontinuation of treatment. 40 Subjects will be enrolled and will receive up to 6 doses of radium-223 dichloride 50 kBq/kg IV every 4 weeks.

The subject will be evaluated for AEs (adverse events) and laboratory tests at each visit every 4 weeks, prior to receiving radium-223 dichloride.

After the end of treatment visit the subjects will enter the active follow up period. Related AEs and SAEs and Lab tests will be evaluated at each visit every 4 weeks for the first 12 weeks, then every 12 weeks for up to 2 years after the last dose of radium-223 dichloride.

After the 2 years of active follow-up, subjects will enter the long-term follow-up period and will be followed via telephone follow-up at 6-month intervals for late toxicities and survival up to 7 years after the last dose of radium-223 dichloride or until death.

Joint safety reviews will regularly take place to oversee safety of the subjects conducted at regular intervals.

An interim analysis of the safety data will be conducted during the study.

A treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) is defined as any event arising or worsening after the start of study drug administration until 30 days after the last administration of radium-223 dichloride., Up to 2.5 years
Radiological Progression Free Survival (rPFS), Radiological progression-free survival (rPFS) was defined as the time from the treatment start date to the date of radiological disease progression or death from any cause (if death occurred before such progression), as documented by the investigator. Participants not experiencing death or radiological disease progression at the database cutoff for primary completion were censored at the last radiological disease progression assessment., Up to 2 years after last treatment|Time to Radiological Bone Progression, Time to radiological bone progression was defined as the time (days) from the treatment start date to the date of radiological bone progression (according to the adapted PCWG2 \[Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2\] criteria), as documented by the investigator. Participants not experiencing radiological bone progression at the database cutoff for primary completion were censored at the last radiological bone progression assessment., Up to 2 years after last treatment|Percentage of Participants With Total Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) Response, Total alkaline phosphatase (ALP) response was defined as ≥ 30% reduction of the blood total ALP level compared with the baseline values. Total ALP response rate was defined as the number of participants with total ALP response divided by the total number of participants evaluable for total ALP response., Up to 2.5 years|Time to Total ALP Progression, Total ALP progression was defined as a ≥ 25% increase above the nadir (lowest baseline or post-baseline) value to at least 1.5 x ULN (upper limit of normal). The time to total ALP progression was defined as the time (days) from the treatment start date to the date of first total ALP progression. Participants not experiencing ALP progression at the database cutoff date, whether or not surviving, were censored at the last ALP laboratory assessment., Up to 2 years after last treatment|Percent Change in Total ALP, Baseline and Week 12, Week 24|Percentage of Participants With Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Response, Prostate specific antigen (PSA) response was defined as a ≥ 30% reduction of blood PSA level compared with the baseline value, confirmed by a second subsequent PSA value with a ≥ 30% reduction from baseline approximately 4 or more weeks later. Prostate specific antigen response rate was defined as the number of participants with PSA response divided by the total number of participants evaluable for PSA response., Up to 2.5 years|Time to PSA Progression, Prostate specific antigen progression was defined as a ≥ 25% increase above the nadir (lowest baseline or post-baseline) value, and an increase in absolute value of ≥ 2 ng/mL above nadir.

Pain improvement rate was the number of participants with pain improvement, divided by the total number of evaluable participants WPS was the mean of the WPS in the last 24 hours from the preceding 7 days., Up to 2.5 years|Time to Pain Progression, Pain progression was defined in participants evaluable for pain progression at baseline, i.e., participants with a WPS of ≤ 7 at the baseline assessment. Pain assessment occurred daily for 1 week, beginning 1 week prior to each visit and including the day of the visit. An evaluable pain assessment interval required completion of a minimum of 4 out of 7 daily questions. Pain progression was defined as the occurrence of either a pain increase or an increase in pain management with respect to baseline, whichever occurred first., Up to 2.5 years|Time to First Symptomatic Skeletal Event (SSE), Time to first symptomatic skeletal event (SSE) is the time (days) from the treatment start date to the first SSE on or following the start date.
