Contrast-enhanced CT-based Deep Learning Model for Preoperative Prediction of Disease-free Survival (DFS) in Localized Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC)
This study aims to preoperatively predict DFS of patients with localised ccRCC using a deep learning prognostic model based on enhanced contrast CT images, validate it's predictive ability in multicentre data and compare it's predictive ability with traditional models.
