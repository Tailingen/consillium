Study of 1cm Versus 2cm Margins for the Surgical Treatment of cT2N0M0 Melanoma
This is a randomized non-blinded pilot study for patients with melanoma staging cT2N0M0 who are candidates for surgical resection. The primary objective is to determine the feasibility of randomizing participants with cT2N0M0 malignant melanoma to surgical treatment with 1cm versus 2cm margins. Study will try to determine overall survival for cT2N0M0 malignant melanoma after surgical treatment with 1cm versus 2cm margins.
Malignant Melanoma
PROCEDURE: Wide Local Excision
Number of participants who agree to blinded randomization to a surgical margin trial for the treatment of early stage melanoma., Number of patients who agree to participate, 2 years
Recurrence (disease free survival), Subjects will be evaluated at 4 month intervals for 2 years and then at 4-6 month intervals for an additional 3 years to evaluate for evidence of disease recurrence., Every 4 months post-surgery for 2 years and then every 4-6 months for an additional 3 years|Quality of life following surgery, Measured by FACT-Melanoma Surgery Subscale, One month post-surgery
After randomization, participants will undergo surgery with wide local excision with either 1cm or 2cm margins. The margin will be based upon the previous biopsy site or area of pigmentation. The skin and subcutaneous tissue (down to fascia) will be resected. Closure considerations may require removal of additional tissue for non-oncologic purposes. As per standard of care, sentinel lymph node biopsy will be performed using a dual tracer technique (technetium radiolabeled sulfur colloid and isosulfan blue) with or without lymphoscintigraphy.
