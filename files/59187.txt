Assessment of the Efficacy and Safety of Pembrolizumab for Ovarian Squamous Cell Carcinoma
This is a phase II, non-randomized, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MK-3475 in patients with ovarian squamous cell carcinoma.
Ovarian Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: MK-3475 (pembrolizumab)
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with the best overall response to complete response) or partial response (PR) as judged by the blinded independent central review (BICR) according to RECIST 1.1, 2 years
Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from enrollment to the first recorded point of disease progression (PD) (as assessed by BICR according to RECIST 1.1) or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., 2 years|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from enrollment to death from any cause., 2 years|Duration of response (DOR), DOR is be defined as the time from the date a response was first documented until the date of disease progression (as assessed by BICR according to RECIST 1.1) or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., 2 years
Exploratory objective: molecular biomarkers for MK-3475 therapy for ovarian squamous cell carcinoma., ORR, PFS, OS, and DOR are assessed in the subgroups divided into high/low XCL1 expression population in tumor tissues, high/low PD-L1 expression population, or high/low tumor infiltration population of CD8 positive lymphocytes., 2 years
This study includes female patients 18 years of age or older with advanced or recurrent unresectable squamous cell carcinoma of the ovary.

Pembrolizumab will be given for a maximum of 2 years i.e. a total of 35 cycles of pembrolizumab with the q3 week dosing.
