National Longitudinal Cohort of Hematological Diseases
Background Hematological diseases are disorders of the blood and hematopoietic organs. The current hematological cohorts are mostly based on single-center or multi-center cases, or cohorts with limited sample size in China. There is a lack of comprehensive and large-scale prospective cohort studies in hematology. The purpose of this study is to analyze the incidence and risk factors of major blood diseases, the treatment methods, prognosis and medical expenses of these patients in China.

Method The study will include patients diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia, multiple myeloma, hemophilia, aplastic anemia, leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, lymphoma, bleeding disorders, blood infection or received bone marrow transplantation in the investigating hospitals from January 1, 2020, and collect basic information, diagnostic and treatment information, prognosis information, as well as medical expense information from medical records. In its current form, the NICHE registry incorporates historical data (collected from 2000) and is systematically collecting prospective data in two phases with broadening reach, and prospectively follow-up to collect the prognosis information.
