Study of the RNR Inhibitor BBI-825 in Subjects with Tumors with Resistance Gene Amplifications
BBI-825 is a potent, selective, oral, small molecule inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR). This is a first-in-human, open-label, non-randomized, 3-part, Phase 1/2 study to determine the safety profile and identify the maximum tolerated dose and recommended Phase 2 dose of BBI-825 administered as a single agent and in combination with select targeted therapies.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: BBI-825
Frequency and severity of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) of BBI-825, TEAEs will be assessed and severity assigned by using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), version 5.0., Start of Cycle 1 until 30 days following last dose (each cycle is 28 days)|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and/or Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of BBI-825, The MTD and/or RP2D of BBI-825 will be determined., Start of Cycle 1 until 30 days following last dose (each cycle is 28 days)
Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) of BBI-825, Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) of BBI-825 will be determined., Start of Cycle 1 until Day 1 of last treatment cycle (each cycle is 28 days)|Trough observed plasma concentration (Ctrough) of BBI-825, Trough observed plasma concentration (Ctrough) of BBI-825 will be determined., Start of Cycle 1 until Day 1 of last treatment cycle (each cycle is 28 days)|Time to Cmax (Tmax) of BBI-825, Time to Cmax (Tmax) of BBI-825 will be determined., Start of Cycle 1 until Day 1 of last treatment cycle (each cycle is 28 days)|Area under the concentration time curve (AUC) of BBI-825, Area under the concentration time curve (AUC) of BBI-825 will be determined., Start of Cycle 1 until Day 1 of last treatment cycle (each cycle is 28 days)|Anti-tumor activity of BBI-825 as determined by RECISTv1.1, Number of participants achieving a best response of progressive disease, stable disease, partial response, or complete response., Start of Cycle 1 until Day 1 of last treatment cycle (each cycle is 28 days)
BBI-825 will be administered orally (PO) twice daily (BID) to subjects with locally advanced or metastatic non-resectable solid tumors, whose disease has progressed despite all standard therapies or for whom no further standard or clinically acceptable therapy exists.
