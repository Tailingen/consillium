Patritumab With Cetuximab and a Platinum Containing Therapy for Patients With Head and Neck Cancer
The purpose of this study is to test a study drug called patritumab. Patritumab may work when combined with other medications that are approved in the UK for treating Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck (SCCHN), called cetuximab, cisplatin or carboplatin. It is hoped that patritumab may have some benefit in treating patients with cancer. This study will help identify how much patritumab can be given in combination with cetuximab, and cisplatin or carboplatin. This study will show how safe and how well tolerated patritumab is when these medications are given together.
Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck
DRUG: Patritumab|DRUG: Cetuximab|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Carboplatin
Percentage of participants experiencing dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), DLTs are used to determine the maximum tolerated dose., 6 months
Pharmacokinetic profile of serum patritumab, Cmax and AUC, 6 months|Pharmacokinetic profile of serum cetuximab, Cmax and AUC, 6 months|Percentage of participants with human anti-human antibody (HAHA) formation (anti-patritumab antibodies), 6 months|Titer of HAHA formation (anti-patritumab antibodies), A titer is a way of expressing concentration. Titer testing employs serial dilution to obtain approximate quantitative information from an analytical procedure that inherently only evaluates as positive or negative. The titer corresponds to the highest dilution factor that still yields a positive reading., 6 months
The trial will be performed in two "phases" (Periods):

Period 1: Initial phase in which the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) is determined

Period 2: Extension phase in which participants who are deriving benefit (stable disease or better) will have the opportunity to continue treatment at the discretion of the Investigator
