linear regression of pediatric quality of life (PedsQL), TIPI, and coded themes from video narratives on coherence, subjectivity and redemption, Participants' composite scores of the 10 items that make up the emotional and social domains from the PedsQL, 15 items from the PedsQL cancer module, and the two items on the TIPI that measure Extroversion will positively covary with the resilient qualities of their narrative as measured by levels of narrative coherence, subjectivity, and redemption, at end of intervention - Approximately 60 minutes after enrolling on study
linear regression of coded resilient qualities of narrative with Post Video Impression Questionnaire, Resilient qualities of the narrative, as measured by levels of narrative coherence, subjectivity, and redemption, will predict the sum of 16 select items on the Post Video Impressions Questionnaire identifying positive impact associated with producing the narrative, at end of intervention - Approximately 60 minutes after enrolling on study|linear regression of impact experienced from making the video narrative with summed scores of participants willingness to post online, The sum of the 16 item composite scale measuring impact experienced from making the testimonial video, on the Post Video Impressions Questionnaire, will positively predict the summed scores of two items measuring participants' willingness to post the video online, at end of intervention - Approximately 60 minutes after enrolling on study|linear regression of perceived impact with summed scores of participants willingness to post the video online, The sum of the 7 item composite scale measuring the perceived impact on others who watch the video, on the Post Video Impressions Questionnaire, will positively predict the summed scores of two items measuring participants' willingness to post the video online, at end of intervention - Approximately 60 minutes after enrolling on study
The current research aims to:

A. enlist teens with cancer to produce video narratives about their experiences with their illness B. explicitly characterize and investigate the videos' content and C. determine what aspects of the production were helpful to the teen making them and predicted to be helpful to those watching them.
