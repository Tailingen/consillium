Study of PIT565 in Relapsed and/or Refractory B-cell Malignancies
This is an open-label, multicenter, phase I study, which primary objective is to characterize the safety and tolerability of PIT565 and to identify maximal tolerated doses (MTDs) and/or recommended doses (RDs), schedule and route of administration in relapsed and/or refractory B-cell Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (R/R B-NHL) and relapsed and/or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (R/R B-ALL).

Incidence and severity of Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), Assessment of safety of study drug. A dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as an adverse event or abnormal laboratory value of CTCAE grade 3 or higher that occurs within the DLT evaluation period (28 days or 35 days depending on the schedule) and that is not primarily related to disease, disease progression, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medications with exceptions provided in the clinical protocol., 28 days or 35 days, depending on the dosing schedule|Incidence and severity of Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Assessment of safety of study drug., 21 months|Frequency of dose interruptions, Assessment of tolerability of study drug, 21 months|Frequency of dose reductions, Assessment of tolerability of study drug, 21 months|Dose intensities, Assessment of tolerability of study drug Dose intensity is defined as the ratio of actual cumulative dose received and actual duration of exposure., 21 months

This is an open-label, multicenter, phase I study of PIT565 in patients with R/R B-NHL and R/R B-ALL.

The study comprises a dose escalation part of PIT565 in two independent groups (group A: R/R B-NHL and B: R/R B-ALL) and a dose expansion part in three independent groups (R/R large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) randomized in 1:1 ratio to two RDs (A1 and A2), and R/R B-ALL (B1)).

During the dose escalation, the safety (including the dose-dose limiting toxicity (DLT) relationship) and tolerability of PIT565 will be assessed, and schedule(s), route(s) of administration and dose(s) will be identified for use in the expansion part based on the review of these data. The RD will also be guided by the available information on pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary anti-tumor activity. The dose escalation will be guided by an adaptive Bayesian logistic regression model (BLRM) following the Escalation with Overdose Control (EWOC) principle.

Different schedules and routes of administrations will be explored in the dose escalation groups.

The dose expansion will further explore the MTD(s) and/or RD(s) and the selected schedule(s) and route of administration(s) in the three patients' groups.
