Comparison of Microwave and Radiofrequency Ablation for Liver
According to randomized controlled trial requirement, the therapeutic effectiveness of cooled-probe microwave ablation and radiofrequency ablation on early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma is compared to find a better approach for minimally invasive thermal ablation.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DEVICE: microwave ablation|DEVICE: radiofrequency ablation
Cumulative survival rates were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and comparison between MWA and RFA was done by the log-rank test., up to 79 months
disease free survival rates were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and comparison between MWA and RFA was done by the log-rank test., up to 79 months|Local tumor progress rates were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and comparison between MWA and RFA was done by the log-rank test., up to 79 months|An independent Student's t-test was used for comparing treatment parameters(power, time, session,etc)between MWA and RFA., up to 79 months|Wilcoxon test was used for comparing liver function between MWA and RFA., up to 79 months
According to following enrollment standard, about \>400 cases of biopsy-proved hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) patients will be involved in the study. They will be treated with percutaneously microwave ablation (MWA) and radiofrequency ablation(RFA). The indications of patients enrolled in the study were as follows: tumor size ≤5cm in diameter, tumor number ≤3, Child-Pugh class A or B classification, no evidence of extrahepatic metastasis, vein or bile duct tumor embolus, and no any other anti-cancer treatment was accepted. MWA or RFA is selected for the patient according to the sequence of their visit to the hospital based on randomization number arrangement produced by SPSS 16.0 statistical software. The therapeutic effectiveness will be compared between two modalities.
