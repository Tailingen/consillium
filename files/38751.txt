Efficacy Study Comparing ZD6474 in Combination With Pemetrexed and Pemetrexed Alone in 2nd Line NSCLC Patients
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) can be treated with drugs that kill tumour cells, stop them from dividing, or stop the growth of the blood supply that cancers need to grow and spread. Clinical research has shown that drugs that inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling can increase overall survival in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Preclinical studies have shown that vandetanib (ZD6474) is an inhibitor of both VEGFR and EGFR signalling. Giving vandetanib may therefore inhibit the growth of cancer cells by blocking their blood supply and by stopping them from dividing. This lung cancer study is to investigate if adding vandetanib to Alimta (pemetrexed) is more effective than Alimta (pemetrexed) alone.

Progression-Free Survival (PFS) in the Overall Population, Median time (in weeks) from randomization until objective disease progression or death (by any cause in the absence of objective progression) provided death is within 3 months from the last evaluable Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) assessment., RECIST tumour assessments carried out every 6 weeks (+/- 3 days) from randomization until objective progression|Progression-Free Survival in the Female Population, Median time (in weeks) from randomization until objective disease progression or death (by any cause in the absence of objective progression) provided death is within 3 months from the last evaluable RECIST assessment., RECIST tumour assessments carried out every 6 weeks (+/- 3 days) from randomization until objective progression
Overall Survival (OS), The OS is defined as the time from date of randomization until death. Any participant not known to have died at the time of analysis was censored based on the last recorded date on which the participant was known to be alive (i.e, their status must be known at the censored date and should not be lost to follow up or unknown)., Time to death in months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), The ORR is the number of participants that are responders i.e, those participants with a confirmed best objective response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as defined by RECIST criteria. The categories for best objective response are CR, PR, stable disease (SD)\>= 6 weeks, progressive disease (PD) or NE., Each participant was assessed for objective response from the sequence of RECIST scan data up to data cut off. RECIST tumour assessments carried out every 6 weeks (+/- 3 days) from randomization until objective progression|Disease Control Rate (DCR), The DCR is defined as the number of patients who achieved disease control at 6 weeks following randomization. Disease control at 6 weeks is defined as a best objective response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) \>= 6 weeks., RECIST tumour assessments carried out every 6 weeks (+/- 3 days) from randomization until objective progression|Duration of Response (DoR), Response is defined as a confirmed best objective response of CR or PR. Duration of response is defined as time from the date of first documented response until date of documented progression or death in the absence of disease progression (provided death is within 3 months of last RECIST assessment)., RECIST tumour assessments carried out every 6 weeks (+/- 3 days) from randomization until objective progression|Time to Deterioration of Disease-Related Symptoms (TDS) by Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS) Total Score, TDS is the interval from the date of randomization to the first assessment of worsened without an improvement in the next 21 days. A deterioration in symptoms is defined as a single visit assessment of 'worsened' with no visit assessment of 'improved' within the next 21 days. The LCSS scale measures changes in symptoms associated with lung cancer., LCSS questionnaires are to be administered every 3 weeks after randomization|Time to Deterioration of Disease-Related Symptoms by Average Symptom Burden Index (ASBI) Score, Time to deterioration is defined as the interval from the date of randomization to the first assessment of worsened without an improvement in the next 21 days. A deterioration in symptoms is defined as a single visit assessment of 'worsened' with no visit assessment of 'improved' within the next 21 days. The ASBI is derived from 6 of LCSS's 9 items., ASBI is a score taken from the LCSS questionnaires which are to be administered every 3 weeks after randomization|Longitudinal Analysis of Lung Cancer Symptom Scale Total Score, The longitudinal data analysis will include all non-missing visit scores and the model will include only the first 12 weeks of data. LCSS total score is an average of all 9 visual analogue participant scales from "none" \[0 millimeter (mm)\] to "as much as it could be" (100 mm)., LCSS questionnaires are to be administered every 3 weeks after randomization|Longitudinal Analysis of Average Symptom Burden Index Score, The longitudinal data analysis will include all non-missing visit scores and the model will include only the first 12 weeks of data. ASBI is an average of the 6 symptom visual analogue patient scales from "none" (0 mm) to "as much as it could be" (100 mm)., ASBI is a score taken from the LCSS questionnaires administered every 3 weeks after randomization
This randomized phase III non-small cell lung cancer clinical trial is studying the effect of Alimta (pemetrexed) plus vandetanib to see how well the combination works compared to Alimta (pemetrexed) alone in patients who have previously been treated for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
