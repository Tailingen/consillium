Ipilimumab + Nivolumab w/Thoracic Radiotherapy for Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of the safety run in Phase I portion of this study is to confirm the recommended Phase II dose of ipilimumab and nivolumab among participants treated with combined thoracic radiation therapy (30 Gy in 10 fractions) and nivolumab/ipilimumab following standard treatment with 4-6 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy.

The purpose of the Phase II portion of this study is to estimate the 6-month Progression Free Survival (PFS) rate among participants treated with ipilimumab and nivolumab with thoracic radiation therapy (30 Gy in 10 fractions) after standard treatment with 4 to 6 cycles of platinum based chemotherapy.

Phase I: Confirmation of Recommended Phase II Dose, Recommended Phase II dose of ipilimumab and nivolumab among participants treated with combined thoracic radiation therapy (30 Gy in 10 fractions) and nivolumab/ipilimumab following standard treatment with 4-6 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy. Investigators will initially enroll 6 patients and wait until completion of the 13-week safety observation period following initiation of ipilimumab + nivolumab combination treatment., 13 weeks|Phase II: Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the duration from date of registration to date of first documentation of progression assessed by local investigator or symptomatic deterioration (as defined above) or death due to any cause., 6 months
Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the duration from date of registration to date of death due to any cause. Participants last known to be alive are censored at date of last contact., 1 year
This study is a nonrandomized, phase II, single arm, multicenter trial evaluating safety and efficacy of thoracic radiation therapy followed by nivolumab and ipilimumab in participants with Extensive-Stage Disease Small Cell Lung Cancer (ED-SCLC) who have completed a first-line platinum-based chemotherapy regimen and achieved ongoing complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD). This study will determine whether nivolumab and ipilimumab delivered 2 weeks following consolidative thoracic radiation therapy demonstrates acceptable toxicity and whether the treatment regimen will improve 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) compared with a similar historical control cohort in this participant population. Additional objectives include further characterization of overall survival, adverse event profile, patterns of failure analysis, and potential predictive biomarkers of response to nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab and thoracic radiation therapy in patients with ED-SCLC.
