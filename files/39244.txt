A Phase II Clinical Trial of Reduced Port Totally Laparoscopic Distal Gastrectomy With D2 Lymph Node Dissection
The purpose of this study is to determine if reduced port totally laparoscopic distal gastrectomy with complete D2 lymph node dissection for gastric cancer is safe and oncological feasible.

67 patients with gastric cancer with preoperative staging from T1 to T3 will undergo reduced port totally laparoscopic distal gastrectomy.

The primary end point of this study is to measure compliance rate with pathology report and compare with previous compliance rate data.
