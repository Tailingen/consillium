Dalteparin and Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Supratentorial Glioblastoma Multiforme
RATIONALE: Dalteparin may stop the growth of cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor and by blocking the enzymes necessary for tumor cell growth. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining dalteparin with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining dalteparin with radiation therapy in treating patients who have newly diagnosed supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme.
Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors
DRUG: dalteparin|RADIATION: radiation therapy
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine whether dalteparin, initiated at the time of conventional radiotherapy, improves the median survival of patients with newly diagnosed supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme.
* Determine the time to progression in patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the incidence of thromboembolic events in patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the feasibility and toxicity of dalteparin in this patient population.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients undergo cranial irradiation 5 days a week for 7 weeks. Beginning concurrently with initiation of radiotherapy, patients receive dalteparin subcutaneously once daily for up to 2 years in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients may continue receiving dalteparin after year 2 at the discretion of the investigator.

Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for up to 5 years after study entry.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 72 patients will be accrued for this study.
