Perioperative Outcomes of Simultaneous Colorectal and Liver Resections
The use of a simultaneous resection in patients with synchronous colorectal liver metastases has increased over the past decades. However, it remains unclear when a simultaneous resection is beneficial and when it should be avoided. The objective of this retrospective study is therefore to compare the outcomes of a simultaneous resection for synchronous colorectal liver metastases in different settings, and to assess which factors are independently associated with unfavorable outcomes.
