Diagnostic Accuracy of lncRNA DQ786243 and miRNA146a in Saliva of Oral Potentially Malignant Lesions
The aim of this study is to evaluate salivary expression of lncRNA DQ786243 as a potential marker for diagnosis of oral potentially malignant lesions compared to normal controls and its effect on salivary expression of miRNA146a.
