Safety Study of Oral Azacitidine (CC-486) as Maintenance Therapy After Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) in Participants With Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) or Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS).
The purpose of the study is to determine the maximal tolerated dose and schedule of CC-486, known as oral azacitidine, in patients with AML or MDS after allogeneic hematopoetic stem cell transplant (HSCT). HSCT is more frequently used in AML or MDS as a potential curative therapy. However, disease recurrence/relapse and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remain the principal causes of fatal complications after transplantation. Oral azacitidine has significant activity in MDS and AML. Oral azacitidine has also demonstrated immunomodulatory activity in AML patients after allogeneic HSCT. An oral formulation of oral azacitidine provides a convenient route of administration and an opportunity to deliver the drug over a prolonged schedule.
Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute|Myelodysplastic Syndromes
DRUG: CC-486
The Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT), A DLT included events that started within 28 days of the first dose of CC-486 in a 28-day cycle, constituted a change from baseline irrespective of outcome, as decided by the investigator to be related to CC-486 including:

* ≥ Grade (GR) 3 nausea, diarrhea, or vomiting despite the use of medical support
* Other significant nonhematologic toxicity of ≥ GR 3 considered not related to the disease or intercurrent illness • Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \< 0.5 x 10\^9/L for \> 1 week despite growth factor support
* Platelets \< 25 x 10\^9/L for \> 1 week despite transfusion support
* Failure of recovery to an ANC ≥ 1.0 x 10\^9/L and/or platelets ≥ 50 x 10\^9/L with a hypocellular marrow by 56 days after the start of a cycle of CC-486 not due to relapse or progressive disease.

The maximum tolerated dose is defined as the cohort delivering the highest dose in which no more than 33% of the evaluable subjects had a DLT The safety population included subjects who received ≥ 1 dose of CC-486, 2 months (Cycles 1 and 2)|Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE), A TEAE was defined as any AE with an onset date on or after the first dose of IP or any event already present that worsened in severity or increased in frequency after exposure to IP up to 28 days after the last dose. In addition, an AE that occurred beyond the timeframe and was assessed by the doctor as possibly related to IP was considered to be treatment-emergent. Severity was assessed using National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Terminology Criteria for AEs (NCI CTCAE) version 4.0, where 1= Mild; 2= Moderate; 3= Severe; 4= Life-threatening; 5= Death related to AE. Serious AEs resulted in death, were life-threatening, required or prolonged inpatient hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly, or resulted in a medical event that may have jeopardized the patient or required medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes above., From the first dose of investigational product (IP) up to 28 days after the last dose of IP.

This is an open-label, multicenter study of oral azacitidine in MDS or AML patients who have undergone allogeneic HSCT. The study consists of three phases: Screening, Treatment and Follow-up. During the Screening phase, the study doctor will do tests to see if the patient is suitable for this study. The patients meeting protocol-specified entry criteria will enter the treatment phase and be assigned to receive one of the oral azacitidine cohorts. The dosing group of 200 mg QD on Days 1 to 7 will be evaluated first (ie, Cohort 1). In the event that unacceptable toxicity occurs in Cohort 1, then oral azacitidine may be evaluated at lower dose levels (eg, 150 mg). If the dosing regimen is confirmed to be safe in Cohort 1, other cohorts will be evaluated sequentially. During the treatment phase, patients will be monitored closely for safety and tolerability. Dosing interruption or delay, dose or schedule reduction, intra-subject dose/schedule escalation or re-escalation may occur on the basis of protocol-specified dosing adjustment guidelines. Safety will be monitored throughout the study at predetermined intervals and as clinically indicated by vital signs, physical examination, performance status, laboratory tests and evaluation of adverse events. The patient can continue to receive the study treatment for up to 12 months provided that they benefit from the study treatment and all protocol-specified criteria are met. However, the patient may receive the study treatment for less than 12 months due to adverse event, disease recurrence or progression. When the study treatment is discontinued, all patients who have received at least one dose of oral azacitidine will be asked to see the study doctor for the treatment discontinuation visit. Thereafter, all patients discontinued from the study treatment will enter the Follow-up phase for safety and survival follow up.
