Prostate Cancer Parameters for Patients Receiving Proton Treatment
To prospectively collect data from patients treated with proton therapy for prostate cancer using the IUHPTC technique for the evaluation of toxicity and efficacy of this treatment technique.
Prostate Cancer
RADIATION: Proton
To prospectively collect a composite of toxicity events on patients who treated with proton therapy for prostate cancer using the IUHPTC technique for the evaluation of toxicity and efficacy of this treatment technique., A collection of toxicity events of proton therapy, evaluate the long-term side effects of hormone suppression vs. non-hormone suppression and documents the clinical benefits this therapy in regards to urinary, sexual and gastrointestinal issues.

To do this the investigators will use the following standard of care data collection forms that include; the International Index of Erectile Function (Attachment 1), the American Urological Association Symptom Index (Attachment 2) and the Radiation Therapy Initial Nursing Assessment (Attachment 3), The prostate preexisting conditions review (attachment 4) and the prostate side effects review (attachment 5). Other clinical data such us demographics, vitals, previous treatments, PSA(prostate specific antigen/Hormone results, follow up data, as described in the protocol schedule of events, will be collected as per routine standard of care., 12 months
The major purpose of this study is to analyze side effects experienced and self-reported by prostate cancer patients undergoing proton radiation therapy at IUHPTC. With the information collected, the investigators will establish pre-existing conditions before proton treatment and measure side effects after treatments that are not related to the pre-existing conditions. Also, to compare long-term side effects for patients who are treated with hormone suppression therapy along with their proton therapy to those patients who do not get treated with hormone suppression therapy. This information will help doctors better understand the side effects experienced and may help provide valuable information for future patients making decisions regarding their treatment options.

Finally, to develop a database of information regarding the treatment and outcomes for patients with prostate cancer in order to improve care of patients with this type of cancer.
