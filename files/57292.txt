Extramedullary Acute Myeloid Leukemia (eAML): Retrospective Single Center Cohort Study, Clinicopathological, Molecular Analysis and Survival Outcomes
Patients with extramedullary leukemia were identified over 10 years (January 2003 to September 2019). Clinicopathological,genetic-molecular features were identified and survival outcomes were studied and analyzed.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
OTHER: retrospective data analysis
Overall survival (OS),, To calculate the median and estimated 4-year overall survival, "4 year, year 4"
Progression-Free Survival, To calculate the median and estimated 4-year PFS, "4 year, year 4"
We retrospectively collected patients demographics ,including clinicopathological and genetic-molecular parameters in patients with extramedullary leukemia between January 2003 till September 2019 from King Hussein cancer center(KHCC) electronic medical records. All potential prognostic factors were identified and compared with worldwide data published previously. Treatment and survival outcomes were studies and analyzed.

Primary endpoint : Overall survival (OS).

Secondary endpoint :

* Progression Free Survival (PFS).
* incidence of extramedullary leukemia.
