A Study to Determine Dose, Safety, and Efficacy of Durvalumab as Monotherapy and in Combination Therapy in Subjects With Lymphoma or Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
This study is designed to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), and the safety, and efficacy of durvalumab as monotherapy and when given in combination with lenalidomide and rituximab; ibrutinib; or bendamustine and rituximab at the RP2D in adults with lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).

Part 1: Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), Dose limiting toxicities were evaluated during the DLT evaluation period for participants in the dose finding cohorts. The severity grading was determined according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 4.03. A DLT is defined as below: Hematologic DLT • Grade 4 neutropenia observed for greater than 5 days duration • Grade 3 neutropenia associated with fever (≥ 38.5 °C) of any duration • Grade 4 thrombocytopenia or Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding, or any requirement for platelets transfusion • Grade 4 anemia, unexplained by underlying disease • Any other grade 4 hematologic toxicity that does not resolve to participant's pretreatment baseline level within 72 hours. Non-Hematologic DLT • Any non-hematological toxicity ≥ Grade 3 except for alopecia and nausea controlled by medical management • Any treatment interruption greater than 2 weeks due to adverse event., Cycle 1 (28 days)|Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events, Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are defined as adverse events (AEs) occurring or worsening on or after the first dose of any study treatment (durvalumab, lenalidomide, ibrutinib, bendamustine or rituximab) and within 90 days after last dose of durvalumab or 28 days after the last dose of other study drugs, whichever was later, as well as those serious adverse events made known to the investigator at any time thereafter that were suspected of being related to study treatment. The intensity of AEs was graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.03. For all other AEs not described in the CTCAE criteria, the intensity was assessed by the investigator as mild (Grade 1), moderate (Grade 2), severe (Grade 3), life-threatening (Grade 4), or death (Grade 5)., From first dose of any study drug to 90 days after last dose of durvalumab or 28 days after last dose of other study drugs, up to the data cut-off date of 6 March 2019. Maximum time on treatment was 55.4 weeks for DUR and 130 weeks for other study drugs.
Overall Response Rate (ORR) During Durvalumab Treatment, For lymphoma participants, response evaluation was based on International Working Group (IWG) response criteria for malignant lymphoma (the Lugano Classification). Overall response rate is defined as the percent of participants with best response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). For chronic lymphocytic leukemia participants, response evaluation was based on International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of CLL. The ORR is defined as the percent of participants with best response of CR, complete response with incomplete marrow recovery (CRi), nodular partial response (nPR), PR, or partial response with lymphocytosis (PRL)., Up to 13 cycles (12 months)|Overall Response Rate During the Entire Study, For lymphoma participants, response evaluation was based on International Working Group (IWG) response criteria for malignant lymphoma (the Lugano Classification) (Cheson, 2014). Overall response rate is defined as the percent of participants with best response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). For chronic lymphocytic leukemia participants, response evaluation was based on International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of CLL.

The study was to consist of 3 parts: dose-finding, dose-confirmation, and dose-expansion. In this study, 4 treatment arms were to be investigated:

* Arm A: durvalumab and lenalidomide ± rituximab
* Arm B: durvalumab and ibrutinib
* Arm C: durvalumab and rituximab ± bendamustine
* Arm D: durvalumab (monotherapy)

The study was to start with 3 dose-finding cohorts (Arms A, B, and C) and 1 dose-confirmation cohort (Arm D) in parallel. All treatment arms were to be open for enrollment at study start except in the US, where Arm D was to enroll depending on the availability of treatment slots and following the completion of assessment of responses from the combination therapy arms. For Arms A and C, prior to enrolling participants to receive all 3 drugs, the doublet combinations were to be evaluated. Once the doublet combinations were deemed tolerable, the eventual triplet combinations were to be tested.

On 05 September 2017, the US FDA issued a Partial Clinical Hold on the study Arm A. Following this Partial Clinical Hold no more participants were enrolled into study Arm A. Participants already enrolled and treated in Arm A who were receiving clinical benefit, based on the discretion of the investigator, could continue study treatment after being reconsented. Arm B and C completed dose confirmation. The dose expansion part of the study was not opened.
