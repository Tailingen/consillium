Persistent Pain After Breast Cancer Treatment (PPBCT) - Risk Factors and Pathophysiological Mechanisms
The study is a prospective cohort study following breast cancer patients from before surgery to one year after. The aims of the study are to determine risk factors that predispose to the development of persistent pain.

The aim of the study is 1) to determine pre-, intra and post surgical risk factors for persistent pain after breast cancer treatment 2) to examine the prevalence of persistent pain 6 and 12 months after surgery 3) provide a quantitative sensory testing (QST) profile of the patient population, measured pre surgery, 1 week and 12 months after surgery.
