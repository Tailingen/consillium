HE4 as a Relapse Biomarker in Ovarian Cancers
HE4 is a more sensitive marker than CA-125 in patients with ovarian cancers. The interest of serum HE4 before surgery has been demonstrated to predict overall survival and its interest has also been shown in combination with CA-125 (ROMA algorithm) to identify high risk patients. To date, no study shows clearly the predictive potential of serum HE4 as an early relapse biomarker in ovarian cancers.
Ovarian Carcinoma
OTHER: Experimental arm
To evaluate the predictive and prognostic value of HE4 marker, Serum concentration of HE4 (pMol) will be analysed at each visit, 24 months
Compare the evolution of HE4 and CA-125 serum concentration, Serum concentration of HE4 and CA-125 (pMol) will be analysed and compared at the time of diagnosis, at each neoadjuvant chemotherapy cycle, before the surgery, and at each chemotherapy cycle, 24 months|Evaluate the progression-free survival at 18 months, HE4 and CA125 will be compared with the rate of progression-free survival, 24 months|Evaluate the quality of surgery, HE4 and CA125 will be compared with completeness of cancer resection score (CCR score)., 24 months
