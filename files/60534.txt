A Phase IIa Study of Sotatercept on Bone Mass and Turnover in Patients With Multiple Myeloma
Lytic bone disease continues to be one of the most devastating complications of multiple myeloma (MM) despite recent and dramatic advancements in MM management, and bone lesions persist and can continue to significantly impact a patient's morbidity, even when an individual's myeloma is otherwise under good control. To date, no agent has been shown to have a prolonged bone anabolic response in myeloma.

Preliminary studies treating healthy postmenopausal women with a single dose of sotatercept demonstrated a rapid and sustained increase in serum biochemical markers of bone formation and a decrease in markers of bone resorption. Similarly, the murine analog to sotatercept, RAP-011, increases bone mineral density and strength in murine studies of both normal animals and models of bone loss. We hypothesize that sotatercept will provide an anabolic response for bone in myeloma patients with bone disease.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Sotatercept|DRUG: Placebo
Presence of biochemical bone turnover, The presence of change in biochemical markers of bone turnover during treatment with sotatercept will be examined., Average of 3 months
Number of Adverse Events related to sotatercept, Average of 21 days|Bone marrow density, Change in bone mineral density of the femoral neck, forearm and spine., Average of 12 months|Change in biochemical myeloma markers, The change in myeloma markers will be determined by quantifying immunoglobulins, SPEP, UPEP and free light chains., Average of 3 months|Size of target bone lesions, Measure the change in size of target bone lesions using x-ray of target skeletal lesions., Average of 6 months
