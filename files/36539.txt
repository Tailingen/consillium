Chemotherapy and Biological Therapy in Treating Patients With Chronic Phase Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining biological therapy with chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy with cytarabine and homoharringtonine and biological therapy with interferon alfa in treating patients with chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia.
Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: Recombinant Interferon Alfa|DRUG: Cytarabine|DRUG: Omacetaxine Mepesuccinate
Number of Patients with Complete Cytogenic Response, Every 3 months
OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the effectiveness of low dose cytarabine, homoharringtonine, and interferon alfa in stimulating a complete cytogenic response in patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive early chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia. II. Evaluate the duration of the cytogenic response in these patients after this treatment. III. Determine differential success rates and analyze results by prognostic subsets (e.g., risk group, splenomegaly, thrombocytosis, age, etc.) in this patient population.

OUTLINE: Patients receive debulking therapy consisting of hydroxyurea until blood count is at proper level. Patients then receive interferon alfa and cytarabine daily by subcutaneous injection. Homoharringtonine is administered by continuous infusion on days 1-5. Treatment continues for 5-7 years in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression (accelerated or blastic phase CML). If complete remission is achieved, peripheral blood stem cells are collected. Patients are followed every 3 months for the first year and every 6 months thereafter.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
