Safety and Efficacy of CEA-Targeted CAR-T Therapy for Relapsed/Refractory CEA+ Cancer
This is a single arm study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CEA-targeted CAR-T cells therapy for patients with relapsed/refractory CEA+ Cancer,and obtain the recommended dose and infusion plan.

Adverse events that related to treatment, Therapy-related adverse events will be recorded and assessed according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, Version 5.0), 2 years
The response rate of CEA CAR-T treatment in patients with relapse/refractory CEA+ Cancer that treatment by CEA CAR-T cells therapy, The response rate of CEA CAR-T treatment will be recorded and assessed according to the irRECIST Version 1.1, 6 months|Duration of Response (DOR) of CEA CAR-T treatment in patients with refractory/relapsed CEA+ Cancer, DOR will be assessed from the first assessment of CR/PR/SD to the first assessment of recurrence or progression of the disease or death from any cause, 2 years|Progress-free survival(PFS) of CEA CAR-T treatment in patients with refractory/relapsed CEA+ Cancer, PFS will be assessed from the first CAR-T cell infusion to death from any cause or the first assessment of progression, 2 years|Overall survival(OS) of CEA CAR-T treatment in patients with refractory/relapsed CEA+ Cancer, OS will be assessed from the first CAR-T cell infusion to death from any cause, 2 years|Levels of CEA in Serum, In vivo (Serum) quantity of CEA, 2 years|Rate of CEA CAR-T cells in peripheral blood, In vivo (peripheral blood) rate of CEA CAR-T cells were determined by means of flow cytometry, 2 years|Quantity of CEA CAR copies in peripheral blood, In vivo (peripheral blood) quantity of CEA CAR copies were determined by means of qPCR, 2 years|Levels of IL-6 in Serum, In vivo (Serum) quantity of IL-6, 3 months|Levels of CRP in Serum, In vivo (Serum) quantity of CRP, 3 months
CEA is a classic tumor marker, especially in more than 80% of colorectal cancer patients. In normal tissue cells, only a small amount of CEA is expressed in the cell membrane of the digestive tract cells, and the CEA is expressed toward the cell cavity under physiological conditions to avoid recognition by CAR-T cells targeting CEA. This is a study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CEA-targeted CAR-T cells therapy,and obtain the recommended dose and infusion plan.
