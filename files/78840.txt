Surgery Versus Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Stage up to IA2 (T1a or T1b) Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
The primary objective of this study is disease free survival rate at 5 years in stage IA2 (T1aN0M0 or T1bN0M0 only) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated either by surgery or stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT).

Today, the best medical literature available confirms that surgery is superior to radiation therapy in the treatment of the early stage lung cancer. However, good emerging data demonstrates potential equality between these two treatments. Two major international studies have tried to compare both treatments but have failed to complete the study because of the lack of patients accrual. We chose to design a trial in which patients will be part of a shared decision making process in selecting the treatment modality.

Patients with early stage lung cancer, that can undergo surgical treatment will be offered SBRT, and in conjunction with the pulmonologist will decide which treatment they prefer. We intend to complete the recruitment of patients within 02 years, then follow-up for 5 more years to collect data.
