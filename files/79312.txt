A Study of PM1015 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
PM1015 is a specific antibody targeting CD73. This is a phase I study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PM1015 in patients with advanced solid tumor.

Objective response rate (ORR), Defined as the number of patients with best overall response of confirmed CR or PR per RECIST 1.1 divided by the patients with at least one tumour imaging evaluation, Up to 24 months|Disease control rate (DCR), Defined as the percentage of patients who have achieved CR, PR, Non-CR/Non-PD, or SD in the study., Up to 24 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), Defined as the time from the date of first dose of study drug to the first observation of documented disease progression per RECIST 1.1 as determined by the Investigators or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 24 months|Overall survival (OS), Defined as the time from the date of first dose of study drug to the date of documented death due to any cause., Up to 24 months|Anti-drug antibody (ADA), PM1015 anti-drug antibody, Up to 30 days after last treatment|Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D), To determine the RP2D of PM1015 injection, Up to 30 days after last treatment|Maximum observed concentration (Cmax), To evaluate the Cmax of PM1015 monotherapy, Up to 30 days after last treatment|Time to Cmax (Tmax), To evaluate the Tmax of PM1015 monotherapy, Up to 30 days after last treatment|Minimum observed concentration (Cmin), To evaluate the Cmin of PM1015 monotherapy, Up to 30 days after last treatment|Trough concentrations (Ctrough), To evaluate the Ctrough of PM1015 monotherapy, Up to 30 days after last treatment|Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0-last), To evaluate the AUC0-tau of PM1015 monotherapy, Up to 30 days after last treatment|Apparent terminal elimination half-life (t1/2), To evaluate the t1/2 of PM1015 monotherapy, Up to 30 days after last treatment
This is a single-arm, open-label, Phase I study contains dose escalation stage and dose expansion stage. The dose escalation stage will be following the accelerated titration design and the classic 3+3 design, with a planned enrollment of 13 to 24 patients with advanced tumors. The dose expansion stage will be used safe and tolerable doses, with a planned enrollment of 24 patients with advanced tumors.
