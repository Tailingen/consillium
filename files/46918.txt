The aim of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility, surgical, and oncologic outcomes of laparoscopic right hemicolectomy with CME and CVL compared to open surgery.

Enrolled patients in the study were randomized to either laparoscopic or open right hemicolectomy with CME and central vascular ligation. The randomization process was performed using a closed envelope method which was withdrawn in the outpatient clinic by a nurse.

The primary outcome was the number of lymph nodes (LNs) harvested among both groups. Secondary outcomes included operative time, blood loss, postoperative complications, and hospital stay.
