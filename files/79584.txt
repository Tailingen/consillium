A Phase III Study Comparing Total and Partial Omentectomy for Patients With Advanced Gastric Cancer
This is a phase III, multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial to evaluate the impact of omentectomy for advanced gastric cancer on patient survival.
Gastric Cancer
PROCEDURE: Type of omentectomy
Disease Free Survival(DFS), Disease Free Survivalof the Participants, 3 years
Overall Survival(OS), Overall Survival of the Participants, 5 years
The volume of intraoperative blood loss, The volume of intraoperative blood loss (IBL) was defined as the total from suction and the weight of gauze sponges at the conclusion of the operation. The Blood loss volume is recorded in milliliters., 1 week|Postoperative morbidity, Postoperative morbidity was defined as the incidence rate of the postoperative complication. The postoperative morbidity were examined within 30 days after surgery. Postoperative morbidity was graded with use of the modified Clavien-Dindo classification of surgical complications., 1 month
In order to evaluate the impact of omentectomy for advanced gastric cancer on patient survival, we designed this trial. Patients who received curative gastrectomy were divided into two groups based on whether they underwent omentectomy. The purpose of this study is to prove the non-inferiority of omentum preservation compared with omentectomy in patients with T3-T4a gastric cancer.
