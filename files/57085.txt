Also, to explore the effect of ART6043 on the Cmax of Olaparib and Niraparib., Pre-dose Cycle 0 Days -2, -1 , Cycle 1 Days 1, 8, 15, 16, Cycle 2 Days 1, 8, 15, Cycle 3 Day 1 Upto 3.7 Years (Each Cycle is 21-Days)|Half life (t1/2), To determine the t1/2 of ART6043 and its potential active metabolite ART7276 following both single and multiple oral dosing of ART6043 monotherapy and following multiple oral dosing of ART6043 in combination with Olaparib and in combination with Niraparib. Also, to explore the effect of ART6043 on the t1/2 of Olaparib and Niraparib., Pre-dose Cycle 0 Days -2, -1 , Cycle 1 Days 1, 8, 15, 16, Cycle 2 Days 1, 8, 15, Cycle 3 Day 1 Upto 3.7 Years (Each Cycle is 21-Days)|Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero to infinity (AUC0-inf), To determine the AUC0-inf of ART6043 and its potential active metabolite ART7276 following both single and multiple oral dosing of ART6043 monotherapy and following multiple oral dosing of ART6043 in combination with Olaparib and in combination with Niraparib.

ART6043 is being developed as an oral anti-cancer agent in combination with a poly (adenosine diphosphate ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor (PARPi) in patients with cancers that harbor defects in DNA repair.

The study will consist of two parts:

1. Part A (Dose-escalation phase):

   Part A will evaluate ART6043 as monotherapy (Part A1) in patients with advanced or metastatic cancer and in combination with either Olaparib (Part A2) or Niraparib (Part A3), in patients with advanced or metastatic cancer with genetic lesions that cause loss of function of known DNA Damage Response (DDR) genes. Olaparib or Niraparib are collectively referred to as PARPi.
2. Part B (dose-expansion phase):

Part B: To further confirm the safety of ART6043 in combination with PARPi (Part B1) and to assess initial effectiveness of ART6043 in combination compared to PARPi alone (Part B2) in patients with certain types of breast cancer.

Patients may continue to receive ART6043 and/or PARPi as long as they may be continuing to derive clinical benefit as assessed by the investigator and/or until disease progression, withdrawal of consent or until they experience unacceptable drug-related toxicity.
