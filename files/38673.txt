Single Center Experience Over a Decade in Living Donor Liver Transplantation for Egyptian Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Stretching the Limits

Recurrence of HCC After LDLT
Recurrence of Hepatocellular carcinoma after LDLT, at least 6 months
590 Egyptian patients underwent LDLT; of them, 172 (32%) patients were transplanted for HCC. Twenty six cases (15.1%) were excluded due to early postoperative mortality (n=22) or due to non HCC related mortality (n=4). One hundred forty six patients were retrospectively reviewed to determine prognostic factors for recurrence.
