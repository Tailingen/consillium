Clinical Outcomes of Endoscopic Resection for Treating WHYX Lesion
Endoscopically, WHYX cancers demonstrated a vague extent of tumor spread due to pale color changes in both the background atrophic and metaplastic gastric mucosa. However, the clinical outcomes of WHYX cancers after endoscopic resection are unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate clinical outcomes of WHYX cancers after endoscopic resection.

complete resection rate, Complete resection was defined to have all of the following features: 1. grossly en bloc resection, 2. Tumor-free lateral and vertical resection margins, 3. No lymphovascular invasion, and 5. A depth of submucosal tumor invasion of less than 500 micrometers., 6 months after endoscopical resection
