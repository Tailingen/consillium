An Observational Study Based on Endometrial Cancer Risk Screening Model
The goal of this observational study is to test the efficiency of our endometrial cancer risk screening calculator, and improve the endometrial cancer risk screening model to form a stable and reliable non-invasive auxiliary diagnostic tool with high sensitivity and specificity in healthy women.The main question it aims to answer is:

·the efficiency of our endometrial cancer risk screening calculator Participants will be collected demographic information, as well as ultrasound, blood routine test and other test results, which will be entered into the endometrial cancer risk screening calculator to obtain high-risk or low-risk prediction results.
