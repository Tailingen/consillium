Incidence and Mortality
Estimated new cases and deaths from gastric cancer in the United States in 2025:[
1
]
New cases: 30,300.
Deaths: 10,780.
Epidemiology
This summary discusses the management of gastric adenocarcinoma, which accounts for 90% to 95% of all gastric malignancies.  Changing epidemiological patterns in the United States regarding the anatomical location of esophagogastric cancers show a trend of decreased occurrence of distal or noncardia gastric cancers.[
2
]  However, in people aged 25 to 39 years, there has been an increase in the incidence of noncardia gastric cancers,  from 0.27 cases per 100,000 individuals (1977–1981) to 0.45 cases per 100,000 individuals (2002–2006).[
2
] Additional studies are needed to confirm the observed increases in noncardia gastric cancers in this specific age group.
In contrast to the overall stable trend for noncardia gastric cancers, earlier studies demonstrated an increased incidence of adenocarcinomas of the gastric cardia of 4% to 10% per year from the mid-1970s to the late 1980s.[
3
]  Similarly, the incidence of gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinomas increased sharply, from 1.22 cases per 100,000 individuals (1973–1978) to 2.00 cases per 100,000 individuals (1985–1990).[
4
]  Since that time, the incidence has remained steady at 1.94 cases per 100,000 individuals  (2003–2008).[
4
]  More recent data demonstrate that the incidence of gastric cardia cancers has been relatively stable, although an increase  has been observed, from 2.4 cases per 100,000 individuals (1977–1981) to 2.9 cases per 100,000 individuals (2001–2006) in the White population.[
2
]  The reasons for these temporal changes in incidence are unclear.
Risk Factors
In the United States, gastric cancer ranks 15th in incidence among the major
types of cancer.  While the precise etiology is unknown,
acknowledged risk factors for gastric cancer include:[
5
-
8
]
Helicobacter pylori
gastric infection.
Advanced age.
Male sex.
Diet low in fruits and vegetables.
Diet high in salted, smoked, or preserved foods.
Chronic atrophic gastritis.
Intestinal metaplasia.
Pernicious anemia.
Gastric adenomatous polyps.
Family history of gastric cancer.
Cigarette smoking.
Ménétrier disease (giant hypertrophic gastritis).
Epstein-Barr virus infection.
Familial syndromes (including familial adenomatous polyposis).
Prognosis and Survival
The prognosis of patients with gastric cancer is related to tumor extent and
includes both nodal involvement and direct tumor extension beyond the gastric
wall.[
9
,
10
]  Tumor grade may also provide some prognostic information.[
11
]
In localized distal gastric cancer, more than 50% of patients can be cured. 
However, early-stage disease accounts for only 10% to 20% of all cases
diagnosed in the United States.  The remaining patients present with metastatic
disease in either regional or distant sites.  The 5-year overall survival rate in
these patients ranges from almost no survival for patients with
disseminated disease to almost 50% survival for patients with localized distal
gastric cancers confined to resectable regional disease.  Even with apparent
localized disease, the 5-year survival rate of patients with proximal gastric
cancer is only 10% to 15%.  Although the treatment of patients with
disseminated gastric cancer may result in palliation of symptoms and some
prolongation of survival, long remissions are uncommon.
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors occur most commonly in the stomach.  For more information, see

Cellular Classification of Gastric Cancer
There are two major types of gastric adenocarcinoma:
Intestinal.
Diffuse.
Intestinal adenocarcinomas are well differentiated, and the cells tend to arrange themselves in tubular or glandular structures.  The terms tubular, papillary, and mucinous are assigned to the various types of intestinal adenocarcinomas.   Rarely, adenosquamous cancers can occur.
Diffuse adenocarcinomas are undifferentiated or poorly differentiated, and they lack a gland formation.  Clinically, diffuse adenocarcinomas can give rise to infiltration of the gastric wall (i.e., linitis plastica).
Some tumors can have mixed features of intestinal and diffuse types.

Treatment Option Overview for Gastric Cancer
In This Section
Capecitabine and Fluorouracil Dosing
The standard form of curative therapy for gastric cancer is radical surgery. 
However, the incidences of local failure in the tumor bed and regional lymph
nodes, and distant failures via hematogenous or peritoneal routes, remain
high.[
1
]  As such, comprehensive staging and evaluation with a multidisciplinary team to determine roles of neoadjuvant, perioperative, and adjuvant combination chemotherapy, surgery, and external-beam radiation therapies should be considered.
Investigators in Europe evaluated the role of perioperative chemotherapy without radiation therapy.[
2
] Initially, in a randomized phase III trial (
MRC-ST02
[NCT00002615]), patients with stage II or higher adenocarcinoma of the stomach or of the lower third of the esophagus were assigned to receive three cycles of epirubicin, cisplatin, and continuous infusion fluorouracil (5-FU) (ECF) before and after surgery or to receive surgery alone. Compared with the surgery group, the perioperative chemotherapy group had a significantly higher overall survival (OS)  (hazard ratio [HR]
death
, 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60–0.93;
P
= .009).[
2
][
Level of evidence A1
]
In addition, in the randomized phase III
AIO-FLOT4
trial (NCT01216644), patients with resectable disease that was stage T2 or higher and/or node positive received either perioperative epirubicin, cisplatin, and 5-FU or capecitabine (ECF/ECX) (three cycles before and after surgery) or perioperative docetaxel, oxaliplatin, and 5-FU/leucovorin (FLOT) (four 2-week cycles before and after surgery). OS was significantly prolonged from 35 months with ECF/ECX to 50 months with FLOT (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.63–0.94;
P
= .012).[
3
]
In a phase III Intergroup trial (
SWOG-9008
[NCT01197118]), 
559 patients with completely resected stage IB to stage IV (M0) adenocarcinoma of
the stomach and gastroesophageal junction were randomly assigned to receive either surgery
alone or surgery plus postoperative chemotherapy (5-FU and leucovorin) and
concurrent radiation therapy (45 Gy).  With a median follow-up of more than 10 years, a
significant survival benefit was reported for patients who received adjuvant combined modality
therapy.[
4
][
Level of evidence A1
]  Median OS was 35 months for the adjuvant chemoradiation
therapy group and  27 months for the surgery-alone arm (
P
= .0046).  Median relapse-free survival was 27 months in the chemoradiation arm compared with 19 months in the surgery-alone arm (
P
< .001).
Gastroesophageal junction cancers may be treated like esophageal cancers and are best managed under the care of a multidisciplinary team.  For more information, see
Esophageal Cancer Treatment
.
Capecitabine and Fluorouracil Dosing
The
DPYD
gene encodes an enzyme that catabolizes pyrimidines and fluoropyrimidines, like capecitabine and fluorouracil. An estimated 1% to 2% of the population has germline pathogenic variants in
DPYD
, which lead to reduced DPD protein function and an accumulation of pyrimidines and fluoropyrimidines in the body.[
5
,
6
] Patients with the
DPYD*2A
variant who receive fluoropyrimidines may experience severe, life-threatening toxicities that are sometimes fatal. Many other
DPYD
variants have been identified,  with a range of clinical effects.[
5
-
7
] Fluoropyrimidine avoidance or a dose reduction of 50% may be recommended based on  the patient's
DPYD
genotype and number of functioning
DPYD
alleles.[
8
-
10
]
DPYD
genetic testing costs less than $200, but insurance coverage varies due to  a lack of national guidelines.[
11
] In addition, testing may delay therapy by 2 weeks, which would not be advisable in urgent situations. This controversial issue requires further evaluation.[

Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR)
.
Surgery
Stage 0 is gastric cancer confined to mucosa.  Experience in Japan, where stage
0 is diagnosed frequently, indicates that more than 90% of patients treated
by gastrectomy with lymphadenectomy survive beyond 5 years.  An American
series confirmed these results.[
1
]
Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR)
EMR has been studied in Japan and throughout Asia in patients with early-stage tumors with good-risk features (Tis or T1a, diameter ≤2 cm, predominantly differentiated type, without ulcerative findings) that have a lower risk of nodal metastasis.  Intramucosal tumors have a lower risk of nodal metastasis than submucosal tumors.[
2
]   Careful patient selection according to risk criteria, treatment with an experienced endoscopist, and close surveillance should be considered.
Evidence (EMR):
A prospective trial of EMR included 445 patients with intramucosal carcinoma (a total of 479 tumors) treated in Tokyo between 1987 and 1998. Complete resection was recommended for patients with evidence of submucosal invasion, blood vessel involvement, and/or positive margins.[
3
][
Level of evidence C2
]
Of the 405 patients with intramucosal disease, 278 underwent complete resection, with 2% local recurrence treated with curative intent and 100% disease-free survival at a median follow-up of 38 months.
In those with resections that were incomplete or not evaluable, 18 of 127 patients had a local recurrence and underwent curative surgery.

Surgical resection
with one of the following procedures:
Distal subtotal gastrectomy (if the lesion is not in the fundus or at the
cardioesophageal junction).
Proximal subtotal gastrectomy or total gastrectomy, both with distal
esophagectomy (if the lesion involves the cardia).  These tumors often
involve the submucosal lymphatics of the esophagus.
Total gastrectomy (if the tumor involves the stomach diffusely or arises
in the body of the stomach and extends to within 6 cm of the
cardia or distal antrum).
Regional lymphadenectomy is recommended with all of the above procedures. 
Splenectomy is not routinely performed.[

Surgical resection
Surgical resection including regional lymphadenectomy is the treatment of
choice for patients with stage I gastric cancer.[
1
]  If the lesion is not in
the cardioesophageal junction and does not diffusely involve the stomach,
subtotal gastrectomy is the procedure of choice, because it has demonstrated
equivalent survival when compared with total gastrectomy and is
associated with decreased morbidity.[
5
][
Level of evidence A1
]  When the
lesion involves the cardia, proximal subtotal gastrectomy or total gastrectomy
(including a sufficient length of esophagus) may be performed with curative
intent.  If the lesion diffusely involves the stomach, total gastrectomy is
required.  At a minimum, surgical resection includes greater and lesser
curvature perigastric regional lymph nodes.  In patients with stage I
gastric cancer, perigastric lymph nodes may contain cancer.
Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR)
EMR has been studied in Japan and throughout Asia in patients with early-stage tumors with good-risk features (Tis or T1a, diameter ≤2 cm, predominantly differentiated type, without ulcerative findings) that have a lower risk of nodal metastasis.  Intramucosal tumors have a lower risk of nodal metastasis than submucosal tumors.[
6
]   Careful patient selection according to risk criteria, treatment with an experienced endoscopist, and close surveillance should be considered.
Evidence (EMR):
A prospective trial of EMR included 445 patients with intramucosal carcinoma (a total of 479 tumors) treated in Tokyo between 1987 and 1998. Complete resection was recommended for patients with evidence of submucosal invasion, blood vessel involvement, and/or positive margins.[
7
][
Level of evidence C2
]
Of the 405 patients with intramucosal disease, 278 underwent complete resection, with 2% local recurrence treated with curative intent and 100% disease-free survival at a median follow-up of 38 months.
In those with resections that were incomplete or not evaluable, 18 of 127 patients had a local recurrence and underwent curative surgery.
Postoperative chemoradiation therapy
Patients with node-positive (T1 N1) and muscle-invasive (T2 N0) disease may consider
postoperative chemoradiation therapy.
Evidence (postoperative chemoradiation therapy):
A prospective,
multi-institution, phase III trial (
SWOG-9008
[NCT01197118]) evaluated postoperative combined
chemoradiation therapy versus surgery alone in 559 patients with completely resected
stage IB to stage IV (M0) adenocarcinoma of the stomach and gastroesophageal
junction. There was a significant survival benefit with adjuvant combined
modality therapy.[
2
][
Level of evidence A1
]
With more than 10 years of follow-up, median survival was 35 months for the adjuvant chemoradiation therapy group  and 27 months for the surgery-alone arm (
P
= .0046).
Median relapse-free survival was 27 months in the chemoradiation arm compared with 19 months in the surgery-alone arm (
P
< .001). Improvement was primarily seen for locoregional recurrence risk (improvement from 47% for surgery vs. 29% for chemoradiation).[
2
]     However, only
36 patients in the trial had stage IB tumors (18 patients in each arm).[
8
]
Because the
prognosis is relatively favorable for patients with completely resected stage
IB disease, the effectiveness of adjuvant chemoradiation therapy for this group is
less clear.
Perioperative chemotherapy
Investigators in Europe evaluated the role of perioperative chemotherapy without radiation therapy.[
9
]
Evidence (perioperative chemotherapy):
In the randomized phase III
AIO-FLOT4
trial (NCT01216644), 716 patients with stage IB to stage III resectable gastric or gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma were randomly assigned to receive either perioperative chemotherapy with docetaxel, oxaliplatin, and fluorouracil (5-FU)/leucovorin (FLOT); or epirubicin, cisplatin, and 5-FU or capecitabine (ECF/ECX).[
3
][
Level of evidence A1
]
Median overall survival was 50 months with FLOT and 35 months with ECF/ECX (hazard ratio, 0.77; 95% confidence interval, 0.63–0.94;
P
= .012).
Margin-free resection in the FLOT group was 85% versus 78% in the ECF/ECX group (
P
= .0162).
Toxicity rates were similar between groups (26% required hospitalizations in the ECF/ECX group and 25% in the FLOT group).  However, types of side effects differed, with increased nausea, thromboembolic events, and anemia in the ECF/ECX group versus higher rates of grade 3/4 infections, neutropenia, diarrhea, and neuropathy in the FLOT group.

Perioperative chemotherapy and immunotherapy regimens (under clinical evaluation).
No randomized trials of adjuvant chemoradiation versus perioperative chemotherapy have been undertaken.
All newly diagnosed patients with stages II and III gastric cancer should consider clinical trials.
Surgical resection
Because of the high risk of locoregional and distant recurrence, perioperative and postoperative therapy should be considered in addition to surgery.
Surgical resection with regional lymphadenectomy is the treatment of choice for
patients with stages II and III gastric cancer; all eligible patients undergo surgery.[
1
]  If the lesion is not in the
cardioesophageal junction and does not diffusely involve the stomach, subtotal
gastrectomy is the procedure of choice.  When the lesion involves the cardia,
proximal subtotal gastrectomy or total gastrectomy may be performed with
curative intent.  If the lesion diffusely involves the stomach, total
gastrectomy and appropriate lymph node resection may be required.  The role of
extended lymph node (D2) dissection is uncertain [
5
] and in some series is
associated with increased morbidity.[
6
,
7
] As many as
15% of selected stage III patients can be cured by surgery alone, particularly
if lymph node involvement is minimal (<7 lymph nodes).
Perioperative chemotherapy
Investigators in Europe evaluated the role of perioperative chemotherapy without radiation therapy.[

Evidence (perioperative chemotherapy):
In the randomized phase III
AIO-FLOT4
trial (NCT01216644), 716 patients with stage IB to stage III resectable gastric or gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma were randomly assigned to receive either perioperative chemotherapy with docetaxel, oxaliplatin, and fluorouracil (5-FU)/leucovorin (FLOT) or epirubicin, cisplatin, and 5-FU or capecitabine (ECF/ECX).[

In the randomized phase III
MAGIC
trial (NCT00002615), patients with stage II or higher adenocarcinoma of the stomach or of the lower third of the esophagus were assigned to  receive three  cycles of epirubicin, cisplatin, and continuous infusion 5-FU (ECF) before and after surgery or to receive surgery alone.[

Compared with the surgery group, the perioperative chemotherapy group had a significantly higher likelihood of progression-free survival (HR

Postoperative (adjuvant) chemoradiation therapy
Patients with stages II

Evidence (postoperative [adjuvant] chemoradiation therapy):
A prospective,
multi-institution, phase III trial (
SWOG-9008
[NCT01197118])  evaluated postoperative combined chemoradiation therapy compared with  surgery alone in
559 patients with completely resected stage IB to stage IV (M0) adenocarcinoma of
the stomach and gastroesophageal junction. Investigators reported a significant survival

Attempts to evaluate the role of more intensive chemotherapy regimens in combination with radiation in the Cancer and Leukemia Group B study (
CALGB-80101
[NCT00052910]) demonstrated no survival benefit.  The 546 patients who had undergone curative resection of stage IB to stage IV (M0) gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma received postoperative 5-FU with leucovorin before and after radiation or postoperative ECF before and after combined radiation therapy.[

The 5-year OS rate was 44% in both arms.
In a phase III Dutch trial (
CRITICS
[NCT00407186]), 788 patients with stage IB to stage IVA gastric/gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma received preoperative chemotherapy and surgery, and then were randomly assigned to receive postoperative chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy.[
11
]  Adjuvant chemoradiation did not improve survival in those who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Median OS was 43 months in the chemotherapy arm and 37 months in the chemoradiotherapy group (95% CI, 0.84–1.22;
P

Postoperative (adjuvant) chemotherapy
Investigators in Europe evaluated the role of postoperative chemotherapy without radiation therapy.[

][
Level of evidence A1
]    During the last 20 years, multiple randomized studies evaluating different treatment regimens (monotherapy vs. combination [doublet and triplet] chemotherapy) have been performed in patients with metastatic gastric cancer with no clear consensus as to the best management approach.  A meta-analysis of these studies demonstrated a hazard ratio  (HR) of 0.83  for overall survival (OS) (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74–0.93) in favor of combination chemotherapy.[
17
] The addition of immune checkpoint inhibitors to oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy has shown further OS benefit.
Evidence (palliative chemotherapy):
Of all the combination regimens, epirubicin, cisplatin, and 5-FU (ECF) is often considered the reference standard in the United States and Europe.  In one European trial, 274 patients with metastatic esophagogastric cancer were randomly assigned to receive either ECF or 5-FU, doxorubicin, and methotrexate (FAMTX).[

The group who received ECF had a significantly longer median survival (8.9 vs. 5.7 months,
P
= .0009) than the FAMTX group.[

In a second trial that compared ECF with mitomycin, cisplatin, and 5-FU (MCF), there was no statistically significant difference in median survival (9.4 vs. 8.7 months,
P

Oxaliplatin or capecitabine are often substituted for cisplatin and 5-FU within the ECF regimen on the basis of results from the REAL-2 trial (
ISRCTN51678883
).[
10
] This randomized trial of 1,002 patients with advanced esophageal, gastroesophageal junction, or gastric cancer utilized a 2 × 2 design.
The trial demonstrated noninferior median OS in patients treated with capecitabine rather than 5-FU (HR
death
,  0.86; 95% CI, 0.82–0.99) and in patients treated with oxaliplatin in place of cisplatin (HR
death
, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.80–1.10)
An international collaboration of investigators randomly assigned 445 patients with metastatic gastric cancer to receive docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-FU (DCF) or cisplatin and 5-FU.[
19
] Time-to-treatment progression (TTP) was the primary end point.
Patients who received DCF experienced a significantly longer TTP (5.6 months; 95% CI, 4.9–5.9; vs. 3.7 months; 95% CI, 3.4–4.5; HR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.19–1.82; log-rank

Febrile neutropenia was more common in patients who received DCF (29% vs. 12%). The death rate was 10.4% in patients who received DCF and 9.4% in patients who received cisplatin and 5-FU.
It is unclear if cisplatin and 5-FU should be considered as an index regimen for the treatment of patients with metastatic gastric cancer.[
20
]  The results of a study that randomly assigned 245 patients with metastatic gastric cancer to receive cisplatin and 5-FU, FAMTX, or etoposide, leucovorin, and 5-FU (ELF) demonstrated no significant difference in response rate, progression-free survival (PFS), or OS between the arms.[
5
]
Grades 3 and 4 neutropenia occurred in 35% to 43% of patients on all arms, but severe nausea and vomiting was more common in patients in the cisplatin-and-5-FU arm and occurred in 26% of those patients.[

The phase III
SPOTLIGHT
trial (NCT03504397) included 565 patients with CLDN18.2-positive, HER2-negative metastatic gastroesophageal or gastric adenocarcinoma. Patients were randomly assigned to receive mFOLFOX6  and either zolbetuximab or placebo.[

]
The median PFS was 10.61 months (95% CI, 8.90–12.48) in the zolbetuximab arm and 8.67 months (95% CI, 8.21–10.28) in the placebo arm (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.60–0.94;
P
= .0066). Patients who received zolbetuximab had a reduced risk of death (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.60–0.94;

Immunotherapy with chemotherapy
Nivolumab with chemotherapy
Nivolumab may be considered in combination with chemotherapy for patients with advanced or metastatic gastric cancer regardless of PD-L1 CPS status.[
28
]
Evidence (nivolumab with chemotherapy):
In a randomized, open-label, international, phase III study (
CheckMate-649
[NCT02872116]), patients with HER2-negative gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinomas were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to receive either nivolumab with chemotherapy (nivolumab 360 mg with CAPOX every 3 weeks or nivolumab 240 mg with leucovorin, 5-FU, and oxaliplatin [FOLFOX] every 2 weeks), chemotherapy alone (CAPOX every 3 weeks or FOLFOX every 2 weeks), or nivolumab 1 mg/kg and ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks × 4 (followed by maintenance nivolumab).   The trial randomly assigned 1,581 patients (including 955 with PD-L1 CPS ≥5) to the chemotherapy-plus-nivolumab arm (n = 789; n = 473 with PD-L1 CPS ≥5) or the chemotherapy-alone arm (n = 792; n = 482 with PD-L1 CPS ≥5).[
28
]
For all patients (regardless of PD-L1 status), the median OS was 14.0 months (95% CI, 12.6–15.0) in the nivolumab-plus-chemotherapy arm compared with 11.3 months (95 % CI, 10.6–12.3) in the chemotherapy-alone arm (HR, 0.77; 99.3% CI, 0.64–0.92;
P
< .0001).
Patients with tumors with PD-L1 CPS greater than 5 had a median OS of 14.4 months (95% CI, 13.1–16.2) in the nivolumab-plus-chemotherapy arm compared with 11.1 months (95% CI, 10.0−12.1) in the chemotherapy-alone arm  (HR, 0.71;  98.4% CI, 0.59–0.86;
P
= .0001).
Grades 3 and 4 adverse events occurred in 462 patients in the combination arm and in 341 patients in the chemotherapy-alone arm.[

Level of evidence A1
]
Trastuzumab with chemotherapy
Trastuzumab may be combined with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy (either 5-FU and cisplatin or CAPOX) as treatment for patients with HER2-positive metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma.  For patients who do not tolerate pembrolizumab, trastuzumab may be combined with cisplatin and 5-FU or capecitabine.  HER2 testing is recommended for patients with metastatic disease.[
29
]
Evidence (trastuzumab and pembrolizumab with chemotherapy):
The double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III, international
KEYNOTE-811
trial (NCT03615326) studied dual pembrolizumab, trastuzumab, and chemotherapy (either 5-FU with cisplatin or CAPOX). A total of 434 patients with metastatic HER2-positive gastric adenocarcinoma were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either chemotherapy and trastuzumab (6 mg/kg every 3 weeks) with or without pembrolizumab (200 mg intravenously [IV] every 3 weeks).
The objective response rate at the first interim analysis was 74.4% (95% CI, 66.2%–81.6%) for patients in the pembrolizumab arm and 51.9% (95% CI, 43.0%–60.7%) for patients in the placebo arm.[
29
][
Level of evidence B3
]
Adverse events grade 3 or higher were observed in 57.1% of patients in the pembrolizumab arm (including 33.6% of patients with immune-related reactions) and 57.4% of patients in the placebo arm.
Evidence (trastuzumab):
In the open-label, international, phase III  Trastuzumab for Gastric Cancer trial (
ToGA
[NCT01041404]),  patients with HER2-positive metastatic, inoperable locally advanced, or recurrent gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer were randomly assigned to receive chemotherapy with or without the anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab.[
30
] HER2 positivity was defined as either 3+ by IHC or a HER2 to CEP17 ratio of 2 or more using FISH. Tumors from 3,665 patients were tested for HER2; of the patients, 810 were positive (22%) and 594 met eligibility criteria for randomization. Chemotherapy consisted of cisplatin plus 5-FU or capecitabine chosen at the investigator’s discretion. The study treatment was administered every 3 weeks for six cycles, and trastuzumab was continued every 3 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. Crossover to trastuzumab at disease progression was not permitted.
The median OS was 13.8 months (95% CI, 12–16) in patients assigned to trastuzumab and 11.1 months (95% CI, 10–13) in patients assigned to chemotherapy alone (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.60–0.91;
P
= .0046).[
30
][
Level of evidence A1
]
There was no significant difference in rates of any adverse event, and cardiotoxic effects  were equally rare in both arms.
Pembrolizumab with chemotherapy
The combination of pembrolizumab and chemotherapy has not shown superiority over chemotherapy alone.
Evidence (pembrolizumab with chemotherapy):
A phase III, partially blinded, randomized, international study (
KEYNOTE-062
[NCT02494583]) of 763 patients with previously untreated advanced gastric cancer with a PD-L1 CPS of one or greater randomly assigned patients 1:1:1 to receive either pembrolizumab 200 mg IV every 3 weeks, pembrolizumab with chemotherapy (cisplatin with 5-FU or capecitabine), or chemotherapy alone.[
31
]
The final results did not show superiority of pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab with chemotherapy over chemotherapy alone.
However, when selected for a PD-L1 CPS of ten or greater, median OS was 17.4 months (95% CI, 9.1−23.1) in the pembrolizumab-alone arm compared with 10.8 months (95% CI, 8.5−13.8) in the chemotherapy-alone arm (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.49−0.97). The prespecified statistical analysis plan did not test this difference further.
Second-line palliative systemic therapy
There is no standard treatment option for patients who develop disease progression after first-line palliative chemotherapy. Accepted regimens include paclitaxel with or without ramucirumab, docetaxel, and irinotecan with or without 5-FU/leucovorin.  Pembrolizumab is approved for the treatment of patients with dMMR or MSI-H tumors, and trastuzumab deruxtecan is approved for patients with HER2-positive gastric cancer.
Palliative chemotherapy
Evidence (palliative chemotherapy):
Investigators in Korea randomly assigned patients with advanced gastric cancer who had previously received one or two  chemotherapy regimens that involved both a fluoropyrimidine and a platinum agent to receive either salvage chemotherapy or best supportive care in a 2:1 fashion.[
32
]  Salvage chemotherapy consisted of either docetaxel (60 mg/m
2
every 3 weeks) or irinotecan (150 mg/m
2
every 2 weeks) and was left to the discretion of the treating physicians.  Of the 202 patients enrolled, 133 received salvage chemotherapy and 69 received best supportive care.
The median OS was 5.3 months in the group that received salvage chemotherapy and 3.8 months in the group that received best supportive care (HR, 0.657;
P
= .007).
There was no difference in median OS between 
docetaxel and irinotecan (5.2 months vs. 6.5 months,
P
= .116).[

Ramucirumab with or without chemotherapy
Ramucirumab is a fully humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2.
Evidence (ramucirumab):
The international,  phase III, placebo-controlled,
REGARD
trial (NCT00917384) included 355 patients with stage IV gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer who had progressed on a first-line 5-FU‒ or platinum-containing regimen. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 fashion to receive either ramucirumab or placebo.[
33
]
Patients who were assigned to ramucirumab had a significantly improved median OS of 5.2 months compared with a median OS of 3.8 months in patients who were assigned to the placebo (HR, 0.776;
P
= .047).
Rates of hypertension were higher in the ramucirumab group than in the placebo group.[
33
][
Level of evidence A1
]
Ramucirumab is an acceptable treatment in patients with cisplatin- or 5-FU‒refractory, stage IV, gastric cancer.
In the international, double-blinded, phase III
RAINBOW
trial (NCT01170663), 665 patients were randomly assigned to receive paclitaxel (80 mg/m
2
) on days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days with either ramucirumab (8 mg/kg) added on days 1 and 15 or a placebo added  on days 1 and 15.[
34
]
Patients who were assigned to ramucirumab had a significant improvement in median OS of 9.6 months compared with a median OS of 7.4 months in patients who were assigned to a placebo (HR, 0.807;
P
= .017).
Grade 3 or higher neutropenia, fatigue, hypertension, and abdominal pain were more common in the ramucirumab group.[
34
][
Level of evidence A1
]
The combination of paclitaxel and ramucirumab is an acceptable second-line chemotherapy regimen in patients with stage IV gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer.
Pembrolizumab for patients with dMMR or MSI-H tumors
Evidence (pembrolizumab for patients with dMMR or MSI-H tumors):
In a phase II study of pembrolizumab 200 mg IV every 3 weeks in patients with colon cancer with or without dMMR, and noncolorectal cancer with dMMR, the immune-related objective response rate was 71% (5 of 7 patients). Based on these data, pembrolizumab was approved for patients with dMMR solid tumors that have progressed after previous treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options.[
35
]
Trastuzumab deruxtecan for patients with HER2-positive tumors (3+ on IHC or 2+ on IHC with a positive FISH)
Trastuzumab deruxtecan is an antibody-drug conjugate combining an anti-HER2 antibody with a topoisomerase I inhibitor via a cleavable tetrapeptide-based linker.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved trastuzumab deruxtecan for patients with locally advanced or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer that is HER2-positive who have previously received a trastuzumab-based regimen.
Evidence (trastuzumab deruxtecan for patients with HER2-positive tumors):
The international, open-label, randomized, phase II
DESTINY-Gastric01
trial (NCT03329690) included 187 patients from Japan and South Korea with HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer that had progressed after at least two previous therapies (including trastuzumab). Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either trastuzumab deruxtecan (6.4 mg/kg every 3 weeks) or the physician’s choice of chemotherapy. The primary study end point was objective response.[
36
]
The objective response rate was 51% for patients who received trastuzumab deruxtecan and 14% for patients who received chemotherapy (
P
< .001).
The OS was 12.5 months for patients who received trastuzumab deruxtecan and  8.4 months for patients who received chemotherapy (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.39–0.88,
P
= .02).[
36
][
Level of evidence A1
]
Common side effects of trastuzumab deruxtecan included neutropenia (grade 3–4 in 51% of patients, with six patients developing neutropenic fever) and anemia (grade 3–4 in 38% of patients).  Twelve patients (10%) developed drug-related interstitial lung disease.
Third-line palliative systemic therapy
Trifluridine and tipiracil
Trifluridine and tipiracil is an oral cytotoxic therapy approved by the FDA for third-line treatment of patients with metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer.
Evidence (trifluridine and tipiracil):
A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, international, phase III trial (
TAGS
[NCT02500043]) included 507 patients with metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who had progressive disease after receiving two previous regimens, including a fluoropyrimidine, a platinum agent, and a taxane and/or irinotecan. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either trifluridine and tipiracil (35 mg/m
2
twice a day on days 1−5 and 8−12 every 28 days) or placebo.[
37
]
The median OS was 5.7 months (95% CI, 4.8−6.2) in patients who received trifluridine and tipiracil, compared with 3.6 months (95% CI, 3.1−4.1) in patients who received placebo (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.57−0.85;
P
= .00058).
The objective response rate was 4% (disease control rate, 44%) in the trifluridine and tipiracil arm, compared with 2% (disease control rate, 14%) in the placebo arm.
Grade 3 or higher adverse events occurred in 80% of patients treated with trifluridine and tipiracil, compared with 58% of patients who received placebo.
Immunotherapy
Pembrolizumab
While pembrolizumab was previously evaluated as third-line treatment for patients with gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancers and a PD-L1 CPS of one or greater, this approval was withdrawn after updates to first-line therapy using combination chemotherapy and programmed death 1 (PD-1) inhibitors.
Nivolumab
Nivolumab has been approved by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare for treatment of advanced gastric cancer, regardless of PD-L1 CPS status.
Evidence (nivolumab):
A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase III  trial (
ONO-4538-12
[ATTRACTION-2] [NCT02267343]) enrolled 493 patients with refractory gastroesophageal/gastric cancer from Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan.[
38
]  Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive either nivolumab (3 mg/kg every 2 weeks) or placebo.
The median OS was 5.26 months (95% CI, 4.60–6.37) in the nivolumab group  compared with 4.14 months (95% CI, 3.42–4.86) in the placebo group.
Serious treatment-related adverse events occurred in 10% of the patients.[

PDQ Adult Treatment Editorial Board
, which is editorially independent of the National Cancer Institute (NCI).  The summary reflects an independent review of the literature and does not represent a policy statement of NCI or the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
Board members review recently published articles each month to determine whether an article should:
be discussed at a meeting,
be cited with text, or
replace or update an existing article that is already cited.
Changes to the summaries are made through a consensus process in which Board members evaluate the strength of the evidence in  the published articles and determine how the article should be included in the summary.
The lead reviewers for Gastric Cancer Treatment are:
Amit Chowdhry, MD, PhD (University of Rochester Medical Center)
Leon Pappas, MD, PhD (Massachusetts General Hospital)
Any comments or questions about the summary content should be submitted to Cancer.gov through the NCI website's
Email Us
. Do not contact the individual Board Members with questions or comments about the summaries. Board members will not respond to individual inquiries.
Levels of Evidence
Some of the reference citations in this summary are accompanied by a level-of-evidence designation. These designations are intended to help readers assess the strength of the evidence supporting the use of specific interventions or approaches. The PDQ Adult Treatment Editorial Board uses a
formal evidence ranking system
in developing its level-of-evidence designations.
