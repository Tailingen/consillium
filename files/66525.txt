An Exploration of Genetic Testing for Prostate Cancer Susceptibility
Study of the factors that affect interest in - and uptake of - genetic testing for variants that predispose to prostate cancer from the perspective of the patient.
Prostate Cancer
Whether cancer worry changes between the two time-points (measured using the Impact of Event Scale)
Why are men interested/ not interested in seeking genetic profiling for prostate cancer, and what might be the uptake of such testing?|What are the expectations of this testing from the perspective of the user, what are the perceived benefits and limitations of testing and how do these change through the testing process|Is there a relationship between a family history of cancer, cancer worry, and a persons intention to seek genetic testing?|How would the information provided by such a test be used by the individual and the family and how could this impact upon the healthcare system
This study will use a mixed methods approach to follow men as they move through the genetic testing process, from initial contact through to receiving their genetic testing results. A questionnaire will be used to measure variables at both baseline and after proceeding through the testing process. A small cohort of men will be invited to be interviewed to gather some in depth qualitative data about the issues that have arisen during the study process.
