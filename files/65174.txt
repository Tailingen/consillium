Feasibility of a Walking Program for Cancer Survivors Receiving Radiation Therapy
This pilot study will assess whether a supported pedometer-based walking program is helpful in maintaining physical activity for breast and head-and-neck cancer patients who are undergoing radiation therapy. Follow-up monitoring sessions will be scheduled to help provide support for physical activity during radiation therapy. We will also examine the relationship of physical activity and quality of life outcomes to help inform future research.
Physical Activity
BEHAVIORAL: Pedometer Walking Program
Accrual Rate and Completion Rate, Accrual: Number of participants agreeing to participate divided by the number of eligible participants Completion rate: number of participants completing the trial, Anticipated duration of radiation therapy of 6 weeks
Adherence, Adherence to the intervention protocol: number of days meeting target step count, Anticipated duration of radiation therapy of 6 weeks
6-Minute Walk Test, The six-minute walk test (6MWT) measures the distance an individual is able to walk over a six minutes time period on a hard, flat surface (e.g., 100 foot hallway)., Change from baseline to anticipated end of radiation therapy of 6 weeks|Physical Activity, An accelerometer armband will be used to provide a breakdown of an individual's daily activity., Change from baseline to anticipated duration of radiation therapy of 6 weeks|Self-esteem, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (10 item), Change from baseline to anticipated duration of radiation therapy of 6 weeks|Depression, Beck Depression Inventory II (21 item), Change from baseline to anticipated duration of radiation therapy of 6 weeks|Happiness, Oxford Happiness Questionnaire (29 items), Change from baseline to anticipated duration of radiation therapy of 6 weeks|Sleep, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (9 item), Change from baseline to anticipated duration of radiation therapy of 6 weeks|Fatigue, Visual analogue scale, recorded as part of daily diary, Recorded daily during study period of 6 weeks
Will the integration of a patient-centered exercise prescription and supportive counseling attenuate declines in physical activity during radiation therapy? To address this question, this study will assess the feasibility of a patient-centered walking program for breast and head-and-neck cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy. Follow-up monitoring sessions will be scheduled to help provide support and ongoing counseling to facilitate increased activity (through walking) during radiation therapy. We will also examine the effect of the walking program on other outcomes such as happiness, depression and sleep to determine point estimates and measures of variability to inform future research.
