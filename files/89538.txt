A Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Dosimetry, and Anti-tumor Activity of Ga-68-NGUL / Lu-177-DGUL in Patients With Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) Refractory to Standard Therapy
This clinical trial is an open-label, single-arm, multi-center, escalation (Phase 1 Part B only), rater-blind (Phase 2 only), phase 1/2 trial to evaluate the diagnostic validity/safety of Ga-68-NGUL and efficacy/safety of Lu-177-DGUL on the anti-tumor activity that aims to simultaneously evaluate diagnostic and therapeutic validity.
Prostate Cancer|mCRPC
DRUG: Lu-177-DGUL|DRUG: Ga-68-NGUL
Objective Response Rate(ORR) according to RECIST 1.1, ORR is defined as the proportion of participants with best overall response of complete response or partial response according to RECIST 1.1, From baseline until radiographic progression or death from any cause, whichever comes first. assessed up to 36 months
PSA response rate(> 50% reduction compared to PSA before treatment), defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved a PSA response, which is considered a reduction of \> 50% from baseline prior to treatment, baseline up to 24 weeks|PSA % change, defined as the % change of PSA level compared to baseline., baseline up to 24 weeks|PSA progression-free survival (PSA PFS), from baseline until the time point at which PSA progression is confirmed or the time point of death is collected, whichever comes first., From baseline until radiographic progression or death from any cause, whichever comes first. assessed up to 36 months|Objective Response Rate(ORR) according to mPERCIST, defined as the proportion of participants with best overall response of complete response or partial response according to RECIST 1.1, baseline up to 24 weeks|Best overall response(BOR) according to RECIST 1.1 and mPERCIST criteria, defined as the best response among all responses at each time point from the start date of Lu-177-DGUL administration., baseline up to 24 weeks|Waterfall plot according to best PSA response, % change in PSA with the highest percentage decrease in PSA values from baseline., baseline up to 24 weeks|Disease Control Rate(DCR) according to RECIST 1.1 and mPERCIST criteria, defined as the proportion of participants with Best Overall Response (BOR) of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) or Stable Disease (SD) according to RECIST v1.1., baseline up to 24 weeks|Duration of Response(DOR) according to RECIST 1.1 and mPERCIST criteria, defined as the duration between the date of first documented Best Overall Response (BOR) of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) and the date of first documented radiographic progression or death due to any cause., From baseline until radiographic progression or death from any cause, whichever comes first. assessed up to 36 months|PSA Doubling time, defined as the date of doubling time of PSA level from baseline., From baseline until radiographic progression or death from any cause, whichever comes first. assessed up to 36 months|Radiological progression-free survival (rPFS), defined the date of first radiological evaluation of disease progression from the first day of administration of Lu-177-DGUL or the time of death, whichever comes first., From baseline until radiographic progression or death from any cause, whichever comes first. assessed up to 36 months|Waterfall plot according to tumor change rate, The size of the target lesion (according to RECIST v1.1) and SUVpeak (according to mPERCIST) % change compared to the baseline are plotted as a waterfall plot, baseline up to 24 weeks|Overall survival (OS), defined as the date from the first day of administration of Lu-177-DGUL to death, From baseline until radiographic progression or death from any cause, whicheve. assessed up to 36 months.|Pain intensity (NRS) and opioid analgesic use, baseline up to 24 weeks|Quality of life (QOL): EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-PR25, EQ-5D-5L, baseline up to 24 weeks
