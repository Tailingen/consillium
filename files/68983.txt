Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women. With the increase of the survival rates, a growing attention is paid to the side effects of the treatments, particularly chemotherapy-induced infertility.

The FEERIC study will give insights into spontaneous fertility outcomes following breast cancer in comparison with a control cohort and will provide data to help patients counselling towards spontaneous fertility rates following breast cancer. It will also provide data on contraceptive prevalence and unintended pregnancy rates in French breast cancer survivors. Reasons for unmet need for family planning will be deciphered, in order to point out pitfalls (lack of patient's information or orientation/ignorance of contraception methods available/topic insufficiently or not discussed with the physician/ lack of family planning offer etc...); and target the appropriate actions to lead (oncologist and oncology nurses education/ dedicated consultations in breast cancer centers/etc...).
