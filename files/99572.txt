Percutaneous Nephroscopic Treatment of Parapelvic Cysts
Background of the project: The surgical treatment of parapelvic cysts is currently less researched and there is no gold standard for surgery. Previously, in percutaneous nephrolithotomy, we found that fenestration and fenestration drainage in the simultaneous treatment of pararenal pelvis cysts under nephroscopic nephroscopic surgery has clear curative effect, less trauma, and quicker recovery.

Objective: To clarify the safety, efficacy and long-term efficacy of percutaneous nephroscopy in the treatment of parapelvic cysts.

Nature: Retrospective case cohort study. Basic research process: Retrospective collection of cases in our hospital who underwent percutaneous nephroscopy for the treatment of parapelvic cysts, and comparison of preoperative and postoperative cyst size changes and long-term efficacy.
