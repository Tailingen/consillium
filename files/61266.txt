This is an open label, multi-center, phase 1b/2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of autologous chimeric antigen receptor-B-cell maturation antigen (CAR-BCMA T cell; zevor-cel/CT053) in patients with relapsed and or refractory multiple myeloma.

Phase 1b of the study will be dose escalation followed by an expansion cohort. After recommended Phase 2 dose is identified in Phase 1b, the enrollment of Phase 2 will start. Following consent, enrolled subjects will undergo a leukapheresis procedure to collect autologous mononuclear cells for manufacture of investigational drug product (zevor-cel). Following manufacture of the drug product, subjects will receive lymphodepletion prior to zevor-cel infusion. All subjects who complete the study, as well as those who withdraw from the study after receiving zevor-cel for reasons other than death or meeting the early termination criteria, will be asked to continue to undergo a 15-year long-term follow-up study.
