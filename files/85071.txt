Radiology Registry on Pancreatic Malignancies
The purpose of this study is to collect all radiological data which evaluated with clinical data may help assess malignancy and prognosis of pancreatic disease.This registry aims to collect retrospective data from 2014 and prospective data until 2027 with a maximum follow-up of 3 years per patient.

OTHER: Radiology evaluations and interventions
Progression- free survival, Time from start of observation to disease progression, From date of intervention until the date of first documented progression, up to a maximum of 3 years|Local progression free survival, Time between (start of) a locoregional treatment and local disease progression, From date of intervention until the date of first documented local progression assessed up to a maximum of 3 years
Overall Survival, The length of time from either the date of diagnosis or the start of treatment for a disease, in which the patients are still alive, From date of treatment until the date of death from any cause assessed up to 3 years
Single center, observational (retrospective and prospective) will collect all available parameters to assess the clinical outcome of the patients (progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), local progression free survival LTPFS), response to treatment) with pancreatic neoplasms presenting to San Raffaele. Patient assignment to a given diagnostic and/or therapeutic procedure is not related to random assignment methods but is part of the ordinary therapeutic strategy planned for each patient on an individual basis and after multidisciplinary discussion.
