TS-1 in Combination With Calcium Folinate in Patients With Heavily Pre-treated mCRC
Primary Objective:

To determine disease control rate (DCR) of TS-1® in patients with heavily pre-treated metastatic colorectal cancer

Secondary Objectives:

* To determine objective response rate (ORR)
* To determine time to progression (TTP)
* To determine overall survival (OS)
* To assess incidence of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) \[Safety and Tolerability\]
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: S-1+leucovorin
Disease Control Rate (DCR), Documented objective response (OR) (defined as partial response \[PR\] or complete response \[CR\]), assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 at any time during trial participation by Investigator assessment, 6 months(an expected average)
Objective Response Rate (ORR), the rate of completely response \[CR\] and partial response \[PR\] patients according to RECIST version 1.1. criteria, 6 months(an expected average)|Time to Progression (TTP), Participants follow-up for disease progression occur. Maximum follow-up time is 12 months after the initial administration of the last subject, until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, 12 months(an expected average)|Overall survival (OS), median time between the start date of study treatment and the date of the death, at death or at the end of study, 24 months(an expected average)|Incidence of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) [Safety and Tolerability], assessed by the NCI-CTCAE (Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects) v4.0 and within some subgroups of patients, From the date of study entry until 30 days after the last dose of study treatment
Simon's optimal two-stage design will be used to determine the sample size for this study.

• Stage I: \>1/9: The first 9 evaluable patients enrolled, \>1 (or ≥2) responders are required in order to enter the second stage, otherwise the trial will be terminated at the first stage due to futility.

• Stage II: Total \>8/34: For the total 34 evaluable patients, \>8 (or ≥9) responders are required to conclude the effectiveness of the study regimen.

The primary endpoint will be disease control rate which will be presented in frequency tabulation with two-sided 95% confidence interval (using binomial estimation).

The secondary endpoints are described as follows:

* ORR will be presented in frequency tabulation with two-sided 95% confidence interval;
* TTP will be estimated by Kaplan-Meier method with two-sided 95% confidence interval;
* OS will be estimated by Kaplan-Meier method with two-sided 95% confidence interval;
* Incidence of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) \[Safety and Tolerability\] : assessed by CTCAE v4.0. Safety parameters will only be analyzed on the safety analysis set and be presented in frequency tabulation.
