Intrathecal Pemetrexed for SCLC Patients With Refractory Brain Metastases or Leptomeninges Metastatic
This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intrathecal pemetrexed for SCLC patients with refractory brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastasis.
Small-cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Intrathecal Pemetrexed
Overall Survival, OS was defined as the duration from the start of intrathecal pemetrexed to patient death, Time from first subject dose to study completion, or up to last follow up
Intracranial progression-free survival (I-PFS), Intracranial progression-free survival was defined as the duration from the start of intrathecal pemetrexed to the worsening of neurological symptoms, radiological confirmation of brain progression, or patient death, Time from first subject dose to study completion, or up to 36 month|Intracranial Objective Response Rate (I-ORR), To assess Intracranial overall response rate according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 by investigator, define as the proportion of subjects who have a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR), Time from first subject dose to study completion, or up to 36 month|clinical remission rate, Clinical Response Rate was defined as the ratio of the patient whose neurological symptoms and KPS improved according to the criteria of clinical response, Time from first subject dose to study completion, or up to 36 month|Adverse events (AEs), Number of participants with adverse events (AEs) according to CTCAE 5.0, Time from first subject dose to study completion, or up to 36 month
This is a prospective interventional clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intrathecal pemetrexed for SCLC patients with refractory brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastasis. Approximately 80 small cell lung cancer patients with refractory brain and/or leptomeningeal metastasis were enrolled and treated with intrathecal pemetrexed, there were 40 cases in cohort 1 with refractory brain metastasis and 40 cases in cohort 2 with leptomeningeal metastasis.Cerebrospinal fluid samples will be collected before and after pemetrexed resistance to analyze molecular mechanisms. The study is expected to commence recruitment in mainland China in about September 2024. It is expected that the trial will end in April 2026.
