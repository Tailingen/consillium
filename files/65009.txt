Concomitant Intraperitoneal and Systemic Chemotherapy in Patients With Extensive Peritoneal Carcinomatosis of Gastric Origin
Gastric cancer with peritoneal carcinomatosis has a poor prognosis, with little treatment options available. The current treatment strategy consists of palliative systemic chemotherapy. However, previous research suggests that systemic chemotherapy is less effective against peritoneal carcinomatosis than against metastases that spread hematogenously.

Several studies suggested that in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis, intraperitoneal chemotherapy (IP) may be superior compared to intravenous chemotherapy. Intraperitoneal chemotherapy could lead to higher concentrations of chemotherapy in the peritoneal cavity for a longer period of time, resulting in an increased cumulative exposure to the peritoneal metastases. A few Asian studies have shown promising results with intraperitoneal chemotherapy in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis of gastric origin. However, intraperitoneal chemotherapy combined with systemic chemotherapy has not been investigated in Western patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis of gastric origin yet. The objective of this trial is to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of intraperitoneal administration of irinotecan, added to systemic capecitabine/oxaliplatin (CAPOX) in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis of gastric origin.
Gastric Cancer|Peritoneal Metastases
DRUG: Irinotecan|DRUG: CAPOX
Maximum-tolerated dose, The maximum tolerable dose and recommended phase II dose of intraperitoneal irinotecan added to systemic chemotherapy (capecitabine/oxaliplatin), 18 weeks
Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, Toxicity graded according to the CTCAE v.5.0 determined at every cycle by the medical oncologist. Toxicity will be summarized descriptively., 18 weeks|Area Under the Curve (AUC) ratio intraperitoneal/systemic irinotecan, During the first irinotecan intraperitoneal cycle, pharmacokinetic measurements wil be obtained. These will be withdrawn at specific time-points, namely prior to infusion, at the end of the intraperitoneal infusion, ass well as 30 minutes, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 24 hours post infusion. Blood samples from a peripheral venous catheter and peritoneal fluid will be drawn from the peritoneal access port. We assume that the AUC of irinotecan and SN-38 follow a log-normal distribution. Therefore, the analysis will be performed on log-transformed data. The antilog will be taken from the ratio and corresponding 95% confidence interval boundaries will be reported., 3 weeks
