Exercise for Improving Prostate Oxygenation in Prostate Tumors (Exipox)
Previous research into metabolic and hypoxic markers has found evidence of preclinical impact of exercise on prostate tumor blood flow and oxygenation in rodents . As radiotherapy is a frequently used and effective therapy for and that sufficient oxygenation is decisive to the effect of radiotherapy, an underlying hypothesis that aerobic exercise might improve treatment efficacy of radiotherapy in prostate cancer is put forward. This study has a potential challenging intervention, but a potential very high gain as it includes active patient participation to significantly improve outcome of radical radiotherapy.
Prostate Cancer|Physical Activity|Hypoxia
OTHER: Physical activity
Hypoxic fraction-gold standard, We will measure the hypoxic fraction in prostate cancer specimens by pimonidazole, through study completion, an average of 1 year
Side effects, We will use the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) designed to evaluate patient function and side effects after PC treatment in both groups, through study completion, an average of 1 year|Hypoxic fraction-MRI, We will try to explore the hypoxic fraction by use of magnetic resonance imaging, through study completion, an average of 1 year|Health related Quality of life, We will use EORTC-QLQ30 which is a validated instrument designed to measure quality of life in prostate cancer in both groups, through study completion, an average of 1 year
A randomized controlled trial with four to five weeks of moderate/high intensity aerobic exercise program compared with no intervention for 32 prostate cancer patients waiting for radical prostatectomy at the University Hospital of North Norway (UNN). 16 patients will undergo the intervention. The expression of the hypoxic marker pimonidazole in the prostate specimens of intervention groups and the control groups will be assessed. This method is considered a reliable tissue oxygenation measurement technique. These patients will also have their and blood flow and hypoxia measured in prostate cancers through magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs).
