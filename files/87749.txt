The Absorption, Metabolism and Excretion of [14C] HQP1351 in Humans
The objective of this study is to determine the mass balance and routes of excretion of total radioactivity after a single oral 30mg (100µCi) dose of \[14C\] HQP1351 given as a suspension. For further clinical development, human mass balance data are required to elucidate the absorption, metabolism, and excretion of HQP1351.
Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML)
DRUG: [14C] HQP1351
Radioactivity concentration of each blood and plasma sample, Use liquid scintillation counter to evaluate Radioactivity concentration of each blood and plasma sample, Day 1- Day 15|Radioactivity concentration of each urine samples, Use liquid scintillation counter to evaluate Radioactivity concentration of each urine sample, Day 1- Day 15|Radioactivity concentration of each feces samples, Use liquid scintillation counter to evaluate Radioactivity concentration of each feces sample, Day 1- Day 15|Total recovery of radioactivity in urine and feces, Calculate the total radioactivity in urine and feces based on the radioactivity concentration of each sample, Day 1- Day 15
Plasma drug concentrations, To determine the plasma concentrations of HQP1351 with validated LC-MS/MS method for obtaining its pharmacokinetics parameters, Day 1- Day 15|Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, According to CTCAE v5.0, the number and frequency of adverse events after a single dose of test drug were assessed., Day 1- Day 15
