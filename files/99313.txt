Concurrent Xeloda and Radiotherapy for Bone Metastases
Hypothesis: Radiosensitization using Xeloda should improve the rate of complete pain relief.

Primary Objective:

* To determine the frequency of pain relief for the proposed regimen.

Secondary Objective(s):

* To determine the duration of pain relief and narcotic relief for the proposed regimen.
* To determine the frequency of narcotic relief for the proposed regimen.
* To determine the toxicity of concurrent UFT and radiotherapy in patients with bone metastases.
