Weekly Nanoparticle Albumin-Bound Paclitaxel (Abraxane) + Weekly Cetuximab + Radiation Therapy (IMRT, Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy) in Patients With Stage III-IVB Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC)
For patients with this type of cancer, one standard treatment option is cetuximab (Erbitux®) + radiation. We wish to study the addition of albumin-bound paclitaxel (Abraxane®) to this standard regimen of cetuximab + radiation. Albumin-bound paclitaxel and cetuximab both are chemotherapy drugs which are administered by vein.

Previous studies have shown that albumin-bound paclitaxel can kill head and neck cancer cells when given alone or in combination with chemotherapy. The purpose of this study is to establish a safe dose range of albumin-bound paclitaxel given in combination with cetuximab and radiation therapy. The investigators want to find out what effects, good and/or bad, the albumin-bound paclitaxel has on you and your head and neck cancer.
