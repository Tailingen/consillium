Perioperative Chemotherapy With Bevacizumab for Colorectal Carcinomatosis
The Bev-IP trial is designed to assess the feasibility and efficacy of a combined treatment consisting of perioperative combination chemotherapy with the vascular endothelial growth factor A inhibitor bevacizumab and cytoreductive surgery with intraperitoneal oxaliplatin.
Colorectal Neoplasms
