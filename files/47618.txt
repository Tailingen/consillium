Pain VAS score, VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) scoring, namely visual analogue scoring, usually employs a straight line or ruler 10 centimeters long, with0 representing the "no pain end" and 10 representing the "most intense pain". The patient marks on the straight line according to the level of pain he or she, to indicate the intensity of pain and the degree of unpleasant psychological experience. The higher the VAS score, the more painful it is. 0 points: no pain; -3 points: mild pain; 4-6 points: moderate pain; 7-9 severe pain; 10 points: unbearable pain, namely severe pain, Evaluation time: 1) the subject returned to the ward after surgery; 2) immediately after electrical stimulation; 3) Postoperative 3 hours、Postoperative 9 hours、Postoperative 15 hours、Postoperative 24 hours|Pain-related measures, Pain-related indicators: Comparison of blood-related indicators between the control group and the intervention group of patients before and 3 hours after surgery, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and interleukin (ILs)., Preoperative and Postoperative 3 hours
PONV classification, The PONV score is a tool used to assess the severity of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). The higher the PONV score, the severe the condition (1-4 mild, 5-6 moderate, 7-10 severe)., Postoperative 3 hours、Postoperative 9 hours、Postoperative 15 hours、Postoperative 24 hours|40-item Quality of Recovery (QoR-40) score, The QoR-40 instrument is a tool used to assess a patient's quality of recovery after surgery. In this instrument, a higher score usually means better quality of recovery., Postoperative 24 hours

3. Explore Related Analgesic Mechanisms The mechanism of the wrist-ankle electrical stimulation analgesia device in post-thyroidectomy analgesia may involve the gate control theory, the release of endogenous analgesic substances, and neural regulation, among others. In the future, we will conduct a series of research works, using molecular biology and neurophysiology methods to deeply explore the possible analgesic mechanisms.

Project Research Contents：

1. Parameter Setting and Evaluation of the Wrist-Ankle Electrical Stimulation Analgesia Device

1. Parameter setting of the wrist-ankle electrical stimulation analgesia device: Adjust the device parameters most suitable for post-thyroidectomy analgesia management and determine the corresponding acupoints, intervention timing, and intervention duration, etc.
2. Safety and effectiveness evaluation: Evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the selected device to ensure that it does not cause additional harm or risk to patients during use and can achieve the expected analgesic effect.

2. Formulation and Optimization of Analgesic Schemes

1. Individualized analgesic schemes: Develop individualized analgesic schemes based on patients' age, gender, weight, surgical scope, pain degree, and other factors.
2. Analgesic effect monitoring: Evaluate the pain degree of patients at different time points after surgery using VAS scores and other scales for quantitative assessment to monitor the analgesic effect.
3. Scheme optimization and adjustment: Adjust the analgesic scheme in a timely manner based on the monitoring results of the analgesic effect, such as adjusting the intervention time and stimulation duration, to achieve the best analgesic effect.

3. Clinical Application of the Wrist-Ankle Electrical Stimulation Analgesia Device

1. Operation training: Provide operation training for medical staff to ensure they can master the usage methods and precautions of the device proficiently.
2. Patient education: Educate patients on postoperative analgesia management, including relevant precautions, possible side effects and countermeasures, etc., to improve patients' compliance and encourage them to actively participate in their own pain management.
3. Observation of clinical application effects: Observe and record the pain degree, comfort level, adverse reactions, etc. of patients during the postoperative analgesia management process using the device, and evaluate its clinical application effect.
4. Remote monitoring and operation: Develop artificial intelligence equipment or mobile application APPs to achieve remote monitoring and operation.

4. Data Analysis and Mechanism Exploration

1. Data collection: Collect patients' pain scores, analgesic drug usage, adverse reaction rates, and preoperative and postoperative psychological evaluation scales, etc.
2. Statistical analysis: Use statistical methods to process and analyze the collected data, compare the effects of different analgesic schemes, and evaluate the effect, safety, and patient satisfaction of the wrist-ankle electrical stimulation analgesia device in post-thyroidectomy analgesia management based on the analysis results.
3. Exploration of analgesic mechanisms: Further explore the possible analgesic mechanisms through molecular biology and neurophysiology methods. For example, use neuroelectrophysiological techniques (such as EEG, EMG, etc.) to study the effects of electrical stimulation on neuronal activity, including changes in excitability, inhibition, and synchronization of neurons. Observe whether the neural activity patterns in pain-related brain regions change under the effect of electrical stimulation and how these changes affect pain perception. It is also possible to study whether electrical stimulation alleviates pain by activating the endogenous analgesic system, such as by releasing endorphins and other analgesic substances.
