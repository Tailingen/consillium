Dose-Escalation and Dose-Expansion Study of IO-202 and IO-202+Pembrolizumab in Solid Tumors
To assess safety and tolerability of increasing doses of IO-202 either as monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors, and select the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D).
Solid Tumor, Adult
BIOLOGICAL: IO-202|BIOLOGICAL: IO-202 + pembrolizumab combination therapy|BIOLOGICAL: RP2D of IO-202 + pembrolizumab combination therapy in multiple solid tumor types
Incidence of treatment-emergent and serious adverse events in patients treated with IO-202 and IO-202 + pembrolizumab, safety and tolerability as measured by the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events., From first dose of IO-202 until the end of treatment which is up to 2 years from the first treatment date|Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) with IO-202 and IO-202 + pembrolizumab, DLTs as measured by the incidence during Cycle 1., From the first dose of IO-202 and IO-202 + pembrolizumab until 21 days after 1st treatment|Study discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs), The number of study discontinuations due to AEs, From the first dose of IO-202 IO-202 and IO-202 + pembrolizumab up to 2 years from the first treatment.
Maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of IO-202, Characterize the Cmax of IO-202 by successive sampling of blood at pre-specified times, From the first dose of IO-202 until Cycle 5, Day 1|Minimum concentration of IO-202, Characterize minimum concentration of IO-202 by successive sampling of blood at pre-specified time points, From the first dose of IO-202 until the last treatment which is up to 2 years from the first treatment date|Immunogenicity of IO-202 and IO-202 + pembrolizumab, Determine the incidence/titer of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) against IO-202 and pembrolizumab (in combination treatment), From the first dose until 24 months after the last treatment|Anti-tumor activity of IO-202 and IO-202 + pembrolizumab, Determine preliminary rates of response after treatment with IO-202, From the date of first treatment until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever comes first, assessed up to an estimated period of 24 months
Receptor occupancy in IO-202 monotherapy and IO-202 + pembrolizumab, To assess target engagement via determining Leukocyte Immunoglobulin-Like Receptor subfamily B4 (LILRB4) occupancy by IO-202 in peripheral blood myeloid cells, as expressed by % of target receptor engagement., From the first dose of IO-202 till 21 days after
This is a Phase 1, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation and dose-expansion study of IO-202 in adult subjects with advanced relapsed or refractory solid tumors to study safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamics and clinical activity of IO-202 as monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab and to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD), and to select the RP2D.
