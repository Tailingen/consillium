Study to Evaluate the Safety, Preliminary Efficacy and Pharmacokinetics of 3810
This project intends to make a study of personalized medicine evaluation system establishment for liver cancer, gastric cancer and nasopharynx cancer to provide strong support for the development of Precision Medicine and personalized medicine for the patients of high-incidence-rates cancer in China.

AE, the number of patients with grade 3 and 4 AE according to CTC AE 4.03, through study completion, an average of 1 year
ORR, The proportion of patients who have observed overall remission (CR) or partial remission (PR) as the overall optimal remission based on the RECIST 1.1., through study completion, an average of 1 year|AUC, Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve, up to 3 cycles(28 days/cycle)|Cmax, Peak Plasma Concentration, up to 3 cycles(28 days/cycle)|DoR, All patients with the best overall response to CR or PR were required to calculate the duration of the response. This time is the duration (progression or death, whichever occurs first) from the first decision to CR or PR to tumor progression or death (death for any cause), through study completion, an average of 1 year|DCR, DCR refers to the percentage of patients who have achieved confirmation during the treatment of CR, confirmed PR and / or SD, through study completion, an average of 1 year|PFS, To the date of randomization to the date of the onset of the disease or the date of death (regardless of the cause of the death) (whichever is the earlier)., through study completion, an average of 1 year
