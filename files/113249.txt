Regorafenib as Single Agent in Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (mCRC) With Any RAS or BRAF Mutation Previously Treated With FOLFOXIRI Plus Bevacizumab
The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of single-agent regorafenib in the second-line treatment in metastatic colorectal cancer with any RAS or BRAF mutation previously treated with FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab in terms of progression-free survival at 6 months.
