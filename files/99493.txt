Study to Assess Safety, Tolerability and Clinical Activity of BGB-290 in Combination With Temozolomide (TMZ) in Participants With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
The primary objective of this study was to determine the safety and tolerability of pamiparib, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) for pamiparib combined with TMZ, to select the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and schedule of pamiparib in combination with TMZ, and to determine the antitumor activity of pamiparib in combination with TMZ.

Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of Pamiparib, Pamiparib pharmakokinetic (PK) parameters were assessed in the first 20 participants enrolled in the dose escalation phase after a single dose on Day -2 and at steady state in combination with TMZ on Day 15., 2 days before Cycle 1 Day 1 (Day -2) at predose, 30 min, 1, 2, 4, 6, 24, and 48 hours after dosing, and on Cycle 1 Day 15 at predose, 1, 2, and 4 hours postdose (each cycle is 28 days)|Plasma Trough Concentrations of Pamiparib (Ctrough), Cycle 1 Day 15 predose|Time to Reach Cmax (Tmax) of Pamiparib, 2 days before Cycle 1 Day 1 (Day -2) at predose, 30 min, 1, 2, 4, 6, 24, and 48 hours after dosing, and on Cycle 1 Day 15 at predose, 1, 2, and 4 hours postdose.|Area Under the Curve From Time 0 to 4 Hours (AUC0-4h) of Pamiparib, 2 days before Cycle 1 Day 1 (Day -2) at predose, 30 min, 1, 2, and 4 hours after dosing, and on Cycle 1 Day 15 at predose, 1, 2, and 4 hours postdose.|Area Under the Curve From Time 0 to Infinity (AUC0-inf) of Pamiparib, 2 days before Cycle 1 Day 1 (Day -2) at predose, 30 min, 1, 2, 4, 6, 24, and 48 hours after dosing|Terminal Elimination Half-life (t1/2) of Pamiparib, 2 days before Cycle 1 Day 1 (Day -2) at predose, 30 min, 1, 2, 4, 6, 24, and 48 hours after dosing (each cycle is 28 days)|Apparent Clearance (CL/F) of Pamiparib, 2 days before Cycle 1 Day 1 (Day -2) at predose, 30 min, 1, 2, 4, 6, 24, and 48 hours after dosing (each cycle is 28 days)|Apparent Volume of Distribution During Terminal Phase (Vz/F) of Pamiparib, 2 days before Cycle 1 Day 1 (Day -2) at predose, 30 min, 1, 2, 4, 6, 24, and 48 hours after dosing (each cycle is 28 days)|Plasma Concentration of Temozolomide (TMZ), Predose (within 30 min prior to dose) and 1 hour post dose on Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 1 Day 7|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of participants with BOR of CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) based on investigator assessment using RECIST v1.1., Up to approximately 5 years and 10 months|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the date of the earliest documented CR or PR (that is subsequently confirmed) to disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs earlier, based on investigator assessment using RECIST v1.1. Only responders will be included in the assessment., Up to approximately 5 years and 10 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time (months) from the date of the first dose of combination treatment to disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, based on investigator assessment using RECIST v1.1, Up to approximately 5 years and 10 months)|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of the first dose of combination treatment to death due to any cause., Up to approximately 5 years and 10 months
