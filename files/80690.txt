Alflutinib Versus Alflutinib Plus Chemotherapy for NSCLC
Aim: the aim of this study is to investigated whether the combination of alflutinib with cytotoxic chemotherapy might hold additive efficacy, as well as tolerability .

alflutinib is a third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that is active in the central nervous system (CNS) and which potently and selectively inhibits mutant forms of EGFR with both TKI-sensitising (activating) mutations and the T790M resistance-conferring mutation. However, resistance to alflutinib inevitably emerges. One promising strategy to further improve patient prognosis and to approach a cure is combination therapy with alflutinib and other agents such as cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs.
