YASU Research Registry: for Young Adults with Cancer
The goal of this observational research registry is to learn about health, wellbeing, and needs of survivors of young adult cancer (diagnosed between the ages of 18 and 39). The main question\[s\] it aims to understand are:

* What are the levels of depression, anxiety, social support, and financial distress
* Determine effectiveness of YASU programming by measuring changes over time

With this registry, the investigators also plan to identify survivors who may be eligible for participation in future research studies pertaining to young adult cancer.

Participants will be asked to complete electronic surveys every 6 to 12 months during participation in the registry.
