Study of Tremelimumab in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
A Phase II, Multi-Center, Open-Label Study of Tremelimumab Monotherapy in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors
Urothelial Bladder Cancer|Triple-negative Breast Cancer|Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: Tremelimumab monotherapy|BIOLOGICAL: MEDI4736 monotherapy|BIOLOGICAL: MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy
Percentage of Patients With Confirmed Overall Response During Tremelimumab Monotherapy Phase, Objective response rate (ORR) during the initial tremelimumab monotherapy phase was assessed by the site Investigator using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) and was defined as the percentage of patients with a confirmed overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) and was based on all treated patients who had measurable disease at baseline (Day 1). 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the Clopper Pearson method., From baseline to 12 months in the tremelimumab monotherapy phase
Median Duration of Response (DoR) During Tremelimumab Monotherapy Phase, DoR during the initial tremelimumab monotherapy phase was assessed by the site Investigator using RECIST 1.1 and was defined as the time from the date of first documented response until the first date of documented progression or death in the absence of disease progression. The time of the initial response was defined as the latest of the dates contributing toward the first visit response of CR or PR. If a patient did not progress following a response, then their DoR was censored at the progression-free survival (PFS) censoring time. DoR was not defined for those patients who did not have documented response. Median DoR was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier technique., From baseline to 12 months in the tremelimumab monotherapy phase|Disease Control Rate (DCR) During Tremelimumab Monotherapy Phase, DCR during the initial tremelimumab monotherapy phase was defined as the percentage of patients who had a best objective response (BoR) of CR or PR in the first 3 months (PDAC patients) or 4 months (UBC and TNBC patients) and 12 months (all patients), or who had demonstrated stable disease (SD) for a minimum interval of 3, 4 or 12 months following the start of study treatment. DCR was determined programmatically based on RECIST 1.1 using site Investigator data and all data up until the first progression event. 95% CIs were calculated using the Clopper Pearson method., From baseline to 12 months in the tremelimumab monotherapy phase|Median PFS During Tremelimumab Monotherapy Phase, PFS during the initial tremelimumab monotherapy phase was assessed by the site Investigator using RECIST 1.1 and was defined as the time from the date of enrollment until the date of objective disease progression or death (by any cause in the absence of progression), regardless of whether the patient withdrew from therapy or received another anticancer therapy prior to progression. Progression events that did not occur within 3 months (PDAC patients) or 4 months (UBC/TNBC patients) of the last evaluable assessment (or first dose) were censored. Median PFS was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier technique., From baseline to 12 months in the tremelimumab monotherapy phase|Best Objective Response (BoR) During Tremelimumab Monotherapy Phase, BoR during the initial tremelimumab monotherapy phase was calculated based on the overall visit responses from each RECIST 1.1 assessment and was defined as the best response a patient had during their time in the study (from CR, PR, SD, PD or not evaluable \[NE\]) obtained among all tumor assessment visits from baseline until end of treatment or determination of PD. The BoR was summarized by percentage of patients for each category (CR, PR, SD, PD, and NE)., From baseline to 12 months in the tremelimumab monotherapy phase|Median Overall Survival (OS) During Tremelimumab Monotherapy Phase, OS was defined as the time from the date of first dose until death due to any cause. Any patient not known to have died at the time of analysis was censored based on the last recorded date on which the patient was known to be alive. OS is presented from start of tremelimumab monotherapy phase and includes the retreatment phase if the patient entered the corresponding treatment phase.

Median OS was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier technique., From baseline to final data cut-off date|Percentage of Patients With Confirmed Overall Response During Retreatment Phase, ORR was assessed by the site Investigator using RECIST 1.1 and was defined as the percentage of patients with a confirmed overall response of CR or PR and was based on all treated patients who had measurable disease at baseline (Day 1) and who sequenced to durvalumab monotherapy (MEDI treatment phase) or durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy (COMBO treatment phase). 95% CIs were calculated using the Clopper Pearson method., From baseline to 12 months in retreatment phase|Median DoR During Retreatment Phase, DoR during the retreatment phase was assessed by the site Investigator using RECIST 1.1 and was defined as the time from the date of first documented response until the first date of documented progression or death in the absence of disease progression. The time of the initial response was defined as the latest of the dates contributing toward the first visit response of CR or PR. If a patient did not progress following a response, then their DoR was censored at the PFS censoring time. DoR was not defined for those patients who did not have documented response. Median DoR was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier technique., From baseline to 12 months in retreatment phase|DCR During Retreatment Phase, DCR during the retreatment phase was defined as the percentage of patients who had a BoR of CR or PR in the first 3 months (PDAC patients) or 4 months (UBC and TNBC patients) or who had demonstrated SD for a minimum interval of 3 or 4 months following the start of study treatment. DCR was determined programmatically based on RECIST 1.1 using site Investigator data and all data up until the first progression event. 95% CIs were calculated using the Clopper Pearson method., From baseline to 4 months in retreatment phase|Median PFS During Retreatment Phase, PFS during the retreatment phase was assessed by the site Investigator using RECIST 1.1 and defined as the time from the date of enrollment until the date of objective disease progression or death (by any cause in the absence of progression), regardless of whether the patient withdrew from therapy or received another anticancer therapy prior to progression.

Progression events that did not occur within 3 months (PDAC patients) or 4 months (UBC/TNBC patients) of the last evaluable assessment (or first dose) were censored. Median PFS was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier technique., From baseline to 12 months in retreatment phase|BoR During Retreatment Phase, BoR during the retreatment phase was calculated based on the overall visit responses from each RECIST 1.1 assessment and was defined as the best response a patient had during their time in the study (from CR, PR, SD, PD or NE) obtained among all tumor assessment visits from baseline until end of treatment or determination of PD. The BoR was summarized by percentage of patients for each category (CR, PR, SD, PD, and NE)., From baseline to 12 months in retreatment phase|Median OS During Retreatment Phase, OS during the retreatment phase was defined as the time from the date of first dose until death due to any cause. Any patient not known to have died at the time of analysis was censored based on the last recorded date on which the patient was known to be alive. Median OS was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier technique., From baseline in retreatment phase to final data cut-off date
This is an open-label, multi-center study to determine the efficacy and safety of tremelimumab in the treatment of different cohorts of patients with selected advanced solid tumors. If eligible and at the discretion of the Investigator, after confirmed disease progression on tremelimumab monotherapy or during follow-up, patients will have the option of being sequenced to MEDI4736 (MedImmune 4736) monotherapy or MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy, for up to 12 months or until disease progression, whichever comes sooner.
