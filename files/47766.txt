TIPOPS (Telemedicine vs In Person Oncology Patient Surveillance)
This research study is comparing telemedicine and face-to-face visits to understand patients' experiences with telemedicine versus face to face visits and to understand when it is and is not appropriate to conduct visits remotely

This study is a prospective randomized trial of telemedicine (TM) versus face-to-face (F2F) visits for follow up care of patients with either early-stage breast or prostate cancer.

This study does not involve investigational drugs or devices but does involve survey data collection from participants about their experiences of care.

After an initial in-person routine visit, participants will be randomly assigned to either telemedicine or face-to-face care delivery for their next routine visit.

It is anticipated participants will be in the study for about 6 months depending on the timing of their routine care appointments.

It is expected that 360 people will take part in this research study
