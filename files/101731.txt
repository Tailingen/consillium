Efficacy and Safety of Organoid-Based Drug Sensitivity Screening to Guide the Treatment of mCRPC Patients Progressed After First-line Treatment
This observational study aims to learn about the effects and safety of organoid-based drug sensitivity screening in mCRPC patients with bone metastases that progressed after first-line treatment. The main question it seeks to answer is:

Do doctors choose treatment agents based on organoid-based drug sensitivity screening results for mCRPC patients, resulting in a better response?

Participants already took bone metastasis biopsies for genetic testing based on current clinical guidelines. This study only takes residual tissue from biopsies for organoid culture.
