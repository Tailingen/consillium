The Role of Cyberchondria Severity in the Relationship Between HPV Awareness and Vaccination Attitudes in Adult Women
Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a prevalent sexually transmitted infection linked to nearly all cases (99%) of cervical cancer. Prophylactic HPV vaccination is effective in preventing these cancers, complemented by HPV screening and treatment of precancerous lesions. The World Health Organization (WHO) aims to eliminate cervical cancer by 2030 through focused efforts on vaccination, diagnosis, and treatment.

Primary prevention strategies include reducing sexual risk factors and administering prophylactic vaccines. Despite awareness of HPV testing, many women lack understanding of its importance and fail to follow through with screenings and necessary treatments. Overall societal awareness of HPV remains inadequate.

Studies reveal disparities in HPV vaccine awareness: while 60.7% of women have heard of the vaccine, only 1% have received it. Awareness varies widely across regions, with Turkey reporting rates from 3.8% to 57%, and vaccine awareness ranging from 2.2% to 74.7% (Özdemir et al., 2020). In the UK, concerns over potential negative results lead many women to defer HPV testing.

Health anxiety, defined as interpreting minor symptoms as serious health issues, drives individuals to seek excessive online health information, a phenomenon known as cyberchondria. Studies link cyberchondria with heightened health anxiety, exacerbated by prolonged internet searches.

Barriers to HPV screening and vaccination include fear of side effects, lack of information, cost concerns, and anxiety over potential outcomes. While women testing positive for HPV show higher levels of cyberchondria, no direct correlation has been established between cyberchondria severity and HPV awareness or vaccination attitudes in adult women.

This summary encapsulates the key findings and insights from the referenced studies on HPV, vaccination, and health anxiety.

Introduction Information Forum, This form, prepared by researchers in accordance with the literature, includes general questions about women's sociodemographic characteristics, reproductive health, and health-seeking behaviors. The form consists of a total of 32 questions, Upon presentation to the clinic|Human Papilloma Virus Awareness and Concern Scale for Women (Women HPV-ACS), Developed by Esencan et al. (2023), this scale aims to measure awareness and concern levels related to Human Papilloma Virus (HPV). The scale comprises 19 items organized into three subscales. Scores range from 0 to 76, with higher scores indicating greater awareness of HPV. The subscales include: Concerns about health (items 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14), Concerns about social exclusion (items 15, 16, 17, 18, 19), and Awareness (items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). Responses are rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (Definitely disagree) to 4 (Definitely agree). The Cronbach's Alpha reliability coefficient for the scale is 0.905 (Esencan et al., 2023), Upon presentation to the clinic|Cyberchondria Severity Scale Short Form (CSS-SF), Developed by McElroy and Shevlin in 2019 and validated by Yam et al. (2023), the CSS-SF consists of 12 items assessing the severity of online symptom searching behaviors related to health concerns. The scale includes four subscales: Excessiveness, Distress, Reassurance-seeking, and Compulsion. Responses are rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (Never) to 5 (Always). Total scores range from 5 to 60, with higher scores indicating greater severity of cyberchondria. The total Cronbach's Alpha coefficient for the scale is 0.89, with subscale Cronbach's Alpha values ranging as follows: 0.83, 0.79, 0.70, 0.80 (Yam et al., 2023).

These descriptions outline the key measures used in the study to assess awareness and concern levels regarding HPV and severity of cyberchondria among women., Upon presentation to the clinic
