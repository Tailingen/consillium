Allo - Cancer - Thrombosis
Management of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with cancer is complex and require the intervention of many specialized health professionals, in hospital but also at home and during follow-up.

The AlloTC project aims to integrate the management of VTE within the multidisciplinary care pathway of the patient with cancer, in order to improve the management of VTE in patients with cancer: optimize treatments and follow-up with appropriate anticoagulants, monitor the implementation of good clinical practice, promote patient involvement and adherence.

The objective of this monocentric study is to evaluate the efficiency of the integration of the therapeutic management of VTE into a specific management of patient with cancer and to set up a specialized "AlloTC" team that coordinates this course of care.

For that purpose, the management of VTE and outcome of patients with cancer and VTE will be compared between two periods : traditional management and management with the "AlloTC" team.
