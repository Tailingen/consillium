Clinical and Pathologic Studies in Neuroendocrine Tumors
This research involves the study of neuroendocrine tumors in order to better understand how the disease grows and spreads. This study requires will use tissue collected from from biopsies performed during your regular medical care (i.e. tissue leftover after your diagnosis has been made) and/or blood and urine samples. This study may lead to the development of special materials that could be used, in the future, to treat neuroendocrine tumors or to follow the response of neuroendocrine tumors to treatment
