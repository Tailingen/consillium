Concurrent Helical Tomotherapy With Chemotherapy in Unresectable Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
This non-randomized Phase I/II study is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of thoracic radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy with cisplatin and docetaxel in patients with LA-NSCLC. All patients will receive weekly administrations of docetaxel 20 mg/mÂ² and cisplatin 20 mg/m2 concurrently with radiotherapy. Radiotherapy will be delivered using helical tomotherapy in 30 daily fractions over six weeks. Patients should have recovered fully from induction concurrent chemoradiotherapy before they continue with the consolidation chemotherapy phase. Patients will be entered in cohorts of at least 5 subjects.

The first cohort of patients will receive 30 fractions of 2Gy in six weeks up to a total dose of 60Gy. The concurrent chemotherapy starts at day 1 of the radiotherapy and will be administered 2-4 hours before the radiotherapy.

The radiotherapy fraction size will be escalated to 2.36Gy in three steps.
Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma
DRUG: Cisplatinum|DRUG: Docetaxel|DEVICE: Tomotherapy
To evaluate the feasibility and toxicity of radiation dose escalation using helical tomotherapy concurrently with chemotherapy (docetaxel-cisplatin combination) in stage III locally advanced non small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC).
To estimate efficacy parameters in terms of overall response rate, progression free survival and overall survival. To monitor quality of life (QOL) before, during and after treatment.
Dose escalation steps are:

30\*2.00Gy = 60.0Gy (BED= 70.8Gy10 NID2= 60.0Gy) 30\*2.12Gy = 63.6Gy (BED= 75.9Gy10 NID2= 64.2Gy) 30\*2.24Gy = 67.2Gy (BED= 81.5Gy10 NID2= 68.5Gy) 30\*2.36Gy = 70.8Gy (BED= 86.3Gy10 NID2= 72.9Gy) If MTD is not reached, protocol modification allowing further escalation can be considered.
