Mini-flap BABA (Bilateral Axillo-breast Approach) Robotic Thyroidectomy is Safe
In this study, a randomized controlled study was conducted between two groups of 40 recipients of conventional flap during BABA robotic-thyroidectomy and 40 recipients of Mini-flap method during BABA robotic-thyroidectomy. In this study, we tried to determine whether the use of Mini-flap can reduce sensory loss and pain after BABA robotic-thyroidectomy.
Thyroid Nodule
PROCEDURE: Mini-flap|PROCEDURE: Conventional flap
Change from baseline in pain, as measured by the Visual Analog Score(VAS), Visual Analog Score for pain, range from 0 to 10, Higher the values represents more pains, 2, 24, 48, 72 hours after surgery|change from baseline in pain, as measured by the number of analgesics uses, number of analgesics(additional ketorolac uses), 2, 24, 48, 72 hours after surgery|change from baseline in Sensory change, as measured by the monofilaments, Six monofilaments were used to measure the pressure threshold of the 2 chest zones and 2 neck zones, 1 day before surgery, 1, 3 months after surgery
Incidence of vocal cord palsy, Check vocal cord palsy that means injury of the recurrent laryngeal nerve with a direct laryngoscope, before surgery, 1 day after surgery, 2, 6 weeks after surgery, 6 month, 1year after surgery|change from baseline in Hypoparathyroidism, as measured by parathyroid hormone level, check PTH (parathyroid hormone) level, before surgery, 1 day after surgery, 2, 6 weeks after surgery, 6 month, 1year after surgery
