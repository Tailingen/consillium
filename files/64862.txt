A Study to Compare Subcutaneous Versus Intravenous MabThera (Rituximab) in Combination With Chemotherapy in Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
This randomized, parallel-group, multi-center study will compare the pharmacokinetics and safety of subcutaneous administration of MabThera (rituximab) versus intravenous MabThera in combination with chemotherapy in previously untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The study consists of 2 parts. In part 1, patients who have previously received 4 cycles of intravenous MabThera will receive in Cycle 5 intravenous MabThera and in Cycle 6 subcutaneous MabThera. In part 2, patients will be randomized to receive either 6 cycles of intravenous MabThera, or 1 cycle of intravenous MabThera and 5 cycles of subcutaneous MabThera. Additionally, all patients will receive chemotherapy (fludarabine and cyclophosphamide) on Days 1-3 or Days 1-5 of every cycle. The anticipated time on study drug is 24 weeks.

Part 1: Subcutaneous Rituximab Dose Resulting in Trough Concentration (Ctrough) Levels Non-Inferior to Intravenous Rituximab, Ctrough is defined as the trough or minimum serum concentration. Pharmacokinetic parameters for rituximab were assessed during Cycles 5 (IV rituximab) and 6 (SC rituximab). Rituximab pharmacokinetic (PK) data from Part 1 were integrated into a population PK model using parametric, nonlinear, mixed-effects modelling. Rituximab IV 500 mg/m\^2 administered once every 4 weeks was compared to fixed doses of rituximab SC between 1400 mg and 1870 mg. The dose selection was performed on Ctrough concentrations at Cycle 5 (pre-dose Cycle 6). A test of the probability of success was applied to each of the 100 replicates, and the percentage of replicates with a positive test corresponded to the probability of success of the trial., Pre-dose and post-dose (15 minutes to end of infusion) on Day 1 and on Days 2, 5, 11 and 15 of Cycle 5 and Pre-dose, Post-dose on Days 2, 3, 5,11, 15 and 29 of Cycle 6; Pre-dose was taken 2 hours prior rituximab dose|Part 2: Rituximab C Trough Levels at Cycle 5, Ctrough is defined as the trough or minimum serum concentration in a given cycle of treatment. The objective of Part 2 was to demonstrate the comparability of the observed Ctrough of rituximab SC 1600 mg and rituximab IV 500 mg/m2 at Cycle 5, as assessed by a non-inferiority test with a lower boundary of at least 0.8 for the 90% CI., +/- 25hours around the 28th day post the 5th Cycle of Rituximab administration
Part 2: Observed Area Under the Serum Concentration-Curve (AUC) of Rituximab at Cycle 6, AUC values were calculated by numerical integration using the linear trapezoidal rule. AUC levels were analyzed using the model below: Ln(AUC) = μ + τi + BlTLij + εij wherein, Ln is the natural log, μ denotes the overall mean effect, τi the effect in each treatment group, BlTLij the tumor load at baseline for each patient and εij a random error variable with normal distribution and mean 0. The treatment effect therein was based on a contrast statement in the model to calculate 90 % confidence intervals for ln(AUC SC)- ln(AUC IV)., Rituximab IV arm: pre-dose, post-dose and on Days 2, 3, 8 ,15, 29 of Cycle 6; Rituximab SC arm: pre-dose, and on Days 2, 3, 8 ,15, 29 of Cycle 6|Part 2: Maximum Observed Concentration (Cmax) of Rituximab at Cycle 6, Cmax was obtained directly from the measured concentration-time curves. The concentration-time curve is the result of time points of blood sampling and its measured concentration of rituximab in the blood samplings., Rituximab IV arm: pre-dose, post-dose and on Days 2, 3, 8 ,15, 29 of Cycle 6; Rituximab SC arm: pre-dose, and on Days 2, 3, 8 ,15, 29 of Cycle 6|Part 2: Time to Cmax (Tmax) of Rituximab at Cycle 6, Multiple blood samples were obtained at pre-dose, post-dose and on Days 2, 3, 8 ,15, 29 of Cycle 6 in Rituximab IV arm, and at pre-dose, and on Days 2, 3, 8 ,15, 29 of Cycle 6 in Rituximab SC arm and time to peak plasma concentration of rituximab was determined., Rituximab IV arm: pre-dose, post-dose and on Days 2, 3, 8 ,15, 29 of Cycle 6; Rituximab SC arm: pre-dose, and on Days 2, 3, 8 ,15, 29 of Cycle 6|Part 2: Terminal Half-Life of Rituximab at Cycle 6, The terminal half-life (t1/2) of rituximab is defined as the time required for the plasma concentration of rituximab to reach half of its original concentration., Rituximab IV arm: pre-dose, post-dose and on Days 2, 3, 8 ,15, 29 of Cycle 6; Rituximab SC arm: pre-dose, and on Days 2, 3, 8 ,15, 29 of Cycle 6|Part 1: Percentage of Participants and Nurses Recording a Preference For Either SC or IV Administration, In part 1 of the trial, upon completion of dosing in cycle 6, participants and their treating nurses were asked whether they have a preference of dosing route, IV vs SC, Days 4 to 5 in Cycle 6|Part 2: Physician/Nurse Opinion on Time Savings With Rituximab SC Compared With Rituximab IV, Physicians and nurses who administered rituximab were asked to answer the following question: " If used in routine practice, on average, how much staff time could be saved with each administration of rituximab SC as compared to rituximab IV?
