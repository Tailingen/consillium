Laparoscopy-Assisted Surgery for Carcinoma of the Low Rectum
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and oncological feasibility of laparoscopy-assisted surgery for low rectal carcinoma compared with open surgery.
Rectal Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: laparoscopic-assisted rectal resection|PROCEDURE: conventional open rectal resection
3 years disease-free survival, Disease-free survival is defined as the time from date of surgery to the date of rectal cancer recurrence or metastasis or cancer-related death (locoregional or distant recurrence) ., 3 years
Pathologic outcomes, Pathologic outcomes are defined as TME quality, negative CRM and negative DRM, length of proximal resection margin (PRM), length of DRM, and the number of retrieved lymph nodes.The TME quality was graded based on the criteria proposed by Nagtegaal et al. as complete, nearly complete, or incomplete.Positive resection margin, including circumferential resection margin (CRM) and distal resection margin (DRM), was defined as the presence of cancer cells within 1 mm from the cut edge., 1 week post operatively|30-day postoperative complications, Thirty-day postoperative complications included any complications occurring within 30 days after surgery. Postoperative complications were graded according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. Severe complications were defined as Clavien-Dindo III-V., 1 month within operatively|30-day postoperative mortality, Thirty-day operative mortality is defined as deaths occurring from any cause during the first 30 postoperative days., 30 days post operatively|Overall survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from date of surgery to date of death from any cause., 3 and 5 years post operatively|Locoregional recurrence rate, Locoregional recurrence was defined as the presence of any anastomotic, pelvic or perineal tumour documented by clinical and/or pathological examination., 3 and 5 years post operatively
Operative time, Operative time is defined as the time from skin incision to the completion of skin suture., Day 1|Conversion to Open Surgery, The conversion is defined as any part of the mesorectal dissection using the traditional open surgery. The surgeon decided the conversion after considering patient safety, technical difficulties, and relevant conditions influencing the completion of TME., Day 1|Estimated blood loss, Estimated blood loss will be measured according to the suction and the weight of wet gauze, and then minus the irrigation., Day 1|Length of hospital stay, Duration of hospital stay measured from the day of surgery until the day of discharge from hospital., from the completion of the surgery till discharge from hospital|Patient self-reported bladder and sexual function, Patient self-reported bladder and sexual function as assessed by the International Prostatic Symptom Score(I-PSS©) for male and female bladder function and the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) Female Sexual Function Index(FSFI©) for sexual function., at postoperative 3,6 and 12 months|Health related quality of life, Health related quality of life assessed by EORTC CR29 score, EORTC CR30 score, at postoperative 3,6 and 12 months
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and oncological feasibility of laparoscopy-assisted surgery for low rectal carcinoma compared with open surgery.
