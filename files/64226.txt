Preoperative Patient Education for Enhanced Recovery After Colon and Rectal Surgery
The aim of this experimental study is to evaluate whether \*\*preoperative patient education can improve outcomes for individuals undergoing colorectal surgery. This study will focus on adult male and female patients with colon cancer scheduled for colorectal surgery through colonoscopy, excluding those undergoing open surgery.

The primary questions this study seeks to answer are:

* Do patients who receive preoperative education experience significantly lower levels of preoperative anxiety compared to those receiving routine hospital care?
* Do patients receiving nursing instructions report significantly lower levels of oral pain postoperatively compared to those who do not?
* Does preoperative education lead to higher levels of patient satisfaction compared to standard care?

Researchers will compare a study group that receives preoperative education to a control group receiving routine hospital care to determine the effectiveness of the intervention.

Participants will be asked to:

* Complete a demographic and medical history questionnaire.
* Utilize the Pain Numeric Rating Scale (NRS-11) to self-report pain levels.
* Participate in assessments using the Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and Information Scale (APAIS)\*\*.
* Complete a satisfaction survey using the Colorectal Surgical Patient's Satisfaction Tool after surgery.

The study aims to assess the impact of preoperative education on anxiety, pain management, and overall patient satisfaction.

Pain Rating Scale, pain Numeric Rating Scale (NRS-11) is 10-point scale for patient self-reporting of pain. It is for adults as 0 indicates no pain, 1-3 mild pain, 4-6 moderate pain, 7-10 severe pain., 1 week
Amsterdam preoperative anxiety and information scale (APAIS), is scale consists of four items (questions 1, 2, 4, 5), each of which could be scored from 1 to 5. The score of the anxiety scale is the sum of these four questions, with a scoring range from 4 to 20.it is developed by Moerman, van Dam, Muller \& Oosting. (1996). Reliability was 0.74., 1 week
Colorectal Surgical Patient's Satisfaction tool, Likert scale ranging from 1 to 3; a score(1) dissatisfied, (2) neutral, (3) satisfied. The total score value ranged between 15 - 45. The higher the score the higher the patient's satisfaction level. This tool was adopted from Salisbury et al., (2005). It was translated to Arabic language and tested for validity and reliability by Abd El-Aziz, (2011). Its internal consistency reliability was (r = 0.840)., 1 week
Patient education and engagement are fundamental components of modern integrated colorectal care pathways. Surgeons and nurses play a crucial role in providing comprehensive education about what patients can expect during both the preoperative and postoperative phases of surgery. Setting clear expectations early-especially regarding the anticipated discharge date-significantly influences the postoperative recovery journey.

Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) is an evidence-based, patient-focused strategy aimed at optimizing surgical outcomes by streamlining the recovery process. Initially designed for colorectal procedures, ERAS protocols have now been adapted for various surgical disciplines, with many of its principles safely applicable to most perioperative patients. The primary objective of ERAS is to minimize the physical and emotional strain of surgery, facilitating quicker recovery, reducing complications, and decreasing the length of hospital stays.

While much of the research on the ERAS program has traditionally centered on the surgeon's role, the multidisciplinary nature of patient care has brought increased recognition to the nurse's contribution. Nursing professionals are now acknowledged as vital components of the ERAS framework, playing a key role in ensuring the program's success.
