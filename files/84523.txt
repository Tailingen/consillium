Pembrolizumab in Patients With Advanced Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma
Pembrolizumab is a new type of drug for mesothelioma (immunotherapy). Laboratory tests show that this drug works by helping improve the body's immune response to help fight cancer. Pembrolizumab may help the immune system to recognize cancer cells and slow down the growth and/or spreading of cancer.
Mesothelioma
DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Pemetrexed|DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Phase II: Progression Free Survival Measured as Time From Randomization to First Observation of Objective Disease Relapse or Progression, PFS was calculated for all randomized patients from the day of randomization until the first observation of disease progression (date of objective relapse or progression of Relapse/Progression Report) or death due to any cause (recorded in Date/Cause of Death Section of Death Report)., PFS was monitored continuously, with assessments every 6 weeks for 3 visits, then every 12 weeks, 4 weeks post-discontinuation, every 12 weeks until progression, and every 24 weeks until death, over an average of 16.2 months.|Phase III: Overall Survival Defined as Time From Randomization to the Date of Death From Any Cause, Overall survival was defined as time from the day of randomization to death for patients died. For patients still alive at time of data-cutoff for analysis, it was censored at the last day the patients were known alive as the last of all dates ., Survival was monitored continuously throughout the study and during follow-up. Patients were evaluated for each cycle, 4 weeks after discontinuation, every 12 weeks until progression, and then every 24 weeks until death, an average of 16.2 months.
Phase III: Progression Free Survival Measured as Time From Randomization to First Observation of Objective Disease Relapse or Progression, PFS was calculated for all randomized patients from the day of randomization until the first observation of disease progression (date of objective relapse or progression of Relapse/Progression Report) or death due to any cause (recorded in Date/Cause of Death Section of Death Report). The primary analysis for PFS was based on the progression evaluated in this study using mesothelioma-modified RECIST (mRECIST) conducted by blinded independent review (BICR)., PFS was monitored continuously, with assessments every 6 weeks for 3 visits, then every 12 weeks, 4 weeks post-discontinuation, every 12 weeks until progression, and every 24 weeks until death, over an average of 16.2 months.|Phase III: Objective Response Rate, Objective response rate was defined as the proportion of patients with best objective response being complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)., Response was monitored continuously, with assessments every 6 weeks for 3 visits, then every 12 weeks, 4 weeks post-discontinuation, every 12 weeks until progression, and every 24 weeks until death, over an average of 16.2 months.
The purpose of this study is to find out what effects a new drug, pembrolizumab has on this type of cancer and if it can offer better results than standard pemetrexed and platinum-based chemotherapy alone. This study will also look at side effects and how the treatments impact quality of life
