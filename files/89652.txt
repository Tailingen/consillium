NKG2D-based CAR T-cells Immunotherapy for Patient With r/r NKG2DL+ Solid Tumors
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of NKG2D-based CAR-T cells infusion in the treatment of relapsed/refractory NKG2DL+ solid tumors.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma|Glioblastoma|Medulloblastoma|Colon Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: NKG2D-based CAR T-cells
Number of Participants with severe cytokine release syndrome(CRS) as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability., The severe CRS post KD-025 CAR-T cells treatment will be evaluated and the maximum tolerated dose will be determined., 0 to 28 days post infusion|Copies numbers of CAR, Copies numbers of CAR in peripheral blood (PB), 1 year post infusion
overall survival (OS), For all subjects, overall survival refers to the period from being included in the test group to death caused by any reason, 2 years post infusion|Progress Free Survival (PFS), Progress Free Survival after administration, 2 years post infusion|Duration of response, (DoR), 2 years post infusion
The preclinical study clarified that NKG2D-based CAR-T cells showed strong cytotoxicity against NKG2DL+ cell lines in vitro as well as a therapeutic effect against NKG2DL+ cell xenografts in vivo. In addition, the data also demonstrated the safety of NKG2D-based CAR-T therapy. NKG2D-based CAR-T represent a potentially effective and safety therapeutic approach for patient with relapsed/refractory NKG2DL+ solid tumors. In this trial, the investigators researched the safety of administering NKG2D-based CAR-T which generated with CD8 hinge region and transmembrane region, 4-1BB costimulatory region and CD3 zeta region. The investigators also assessed that disease response was determined within the context of a phase I trial.
