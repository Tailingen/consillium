68Ga-NI-FAPI PET/CT: First-in-human Study
68Ga-NI-FAPI is a novel radiotracer incorporating a hypoxia sensitive nitroimidazole (NI)-moiety and a FAP-targeting. In this study, we observed the safety, biodistribution, radiation dosimetry and diagnostic value of 68Ga-NI-FAPI PET/CT in patients with different types of cancer.
Malignant Neoplasm
DRUG: 68Ga-NI-FAPI
safety and tolerability, Hematologic status, liver function, renal function and General vital signs were recorded before and 1 week after administration of radiopharmaceutical. Adverse events were categorized using the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events 5.0., up to 1 week
Dosimetry of normal organs and tumors, The semiquantitative dosimetry will be performed based on PET/CT acquisitions after the first administration of 68Ga-NI-FAPI. The dose delivered to normal organs and tumors will be recorded., From right after tracer injection to 150 minutes at post-injection
Diagnostic value, Sensitivity and Specificity of 68Ga-NI-FAPI for patients with various cancers., through study completion, an average of 3 months
Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are an integral part of the tumor microenvironment, and fibroblast activation protein (FAP), as a specific marker of CAFs, is overexpressed in more than 90% of epithelial malignant tumors' CAFs, with limited expression in normal tissues, making it an appropriate target for various tumors. Currently, several tracers targeting FAP for diagnostic purposes have been developed, such as 68Ga-FAPI-04, 68Ga-FAPI-02, and showed high efficacy in tumor staging and restaging. 68Ga-NI-FAPI is a novel agent incorporating a hypoxia sensitive nitroimidazole (NI)-moiety and a FAP-targeting. This pilot study was prospectively designed to evaluate the safety, biodistribution, radiation dosimetry and diagnostic value of 68Ga-NI-FAPI in patients with different types of cancer.
