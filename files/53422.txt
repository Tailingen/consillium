Folfoxiri Plus Bev Followed by Reintroduction of Folfoxiri Plus Bev at Progression Versus Folfox Plus Bev Followed by Folfiri Plus Bev in mCRC
Bev improves the efficacy of first-line chemotherapy in unresectable mCRC. In the phase III TRIBE trial upfront FOLFOXIRI plus bev provided a significant advantage in terms of PFS and RR compared to FOLFIRI plus bev. A trend toward better OS was also evidenced. The second-line treatment was at investigator's choice. A manageable increase in diarrhea, mucositis and neutropenia was reported, while no differences in febrile neutropenia, serious adverse events and toxic deaths were evidenced.

A growing amount of data support the clinical relevance of achieving an early and deep tumor shrinkage.

Phase III TML and BEBYP trials demonstrated that the continuation of bev beyond disease progression combined with a switched chemotherapy regimen provided a significant advantage in terms of OS and PFS.

Based on recent evidences, the partial interruption of the upfront "induction" chemotherapy before disease progression and the prosecution of bev until disease progression as maintenance treatment is a valid strategy in the treatment of mCRC.

On the basis of these considerations, a first-line doublet plus bev followed by a second-line switched doublet (from oxaliplatin to irinotecan and viceversa) plus bev should be considered a standard option for mCRC patients. Only retrospectively collected data are currently available about the efficacy of first-line FOLFOXIRI plus bev followed by second-line rechallenge with FOLFOXIRI plus bev. We therefore designed the present phase III randomized trial of first-line FOLFOXIRI plus bev followed by reintroduction of FOLFOXIRI plus bev at progression versus FOLFOX plus bev followed by FOLFIRI plus bev at progression in first- and second-line treatment of unresectable mCRC patients.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: fluoruracil|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Irinotecan|DRUG: Bevacizumab
Progression Free Survival 2 (PFS2), PFS2 will be defined as beginning with randomization and ending with the first of the following events: a) death; b) disease progression on any treatment given after 1st progression. For patients that will not receive any treatment within 3 months after 1st progression, PFS2 will be equal to PFS. The determination of disease progression will be based on investigator-reported measurements. Disease status will be evaluated according to RECIST 1.1 criteria.

Censoring rules for PFS2 will be: end of study without PD, loss at follow-up. Curative surgery for metastasis will not result in censoring for PFS2., from randomization to the first of the following events: a) death; b) disease progression on any treatment given after 1st progression, up to 18 months after last patient last visit
Progression free survival (PFS), Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from randomization to the first documentation of objective disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. PFS will be censored on the date of the last evaluable on study tumor assessment documenting absence of progressive disease for patients who are alive, on study and progression free at the time of the analysis. Alive patients having no tumor assessments after baseline will have time to event censored on the date of randomization, from randomization to to the first documentation of objective disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, up to 18 months after last patient last visit|2nd-Progression free survival (2nd-PFS), 2nd-Progression free survival (2nd-PFS) is defined as the time from the beginning of the second-line treatment to the documentation of objective disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. 2nd-PFS will be censored on the date of the last evaluable on study tumor assessment documenting absence of progressive disease for patients who are alive, on study and 2nd-progression free at the time of the analysis., from the beginning of the second-line treatment to the documentation of objective disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, up to 18 months after last patient last visit|Time to failure of strategy (TFS), Time to failure of strategy (TFS) is defined as the time time from randomization to the first of the following events: death; patient requires the addition of a new therapeutic agent (i.e. an agent not included in the original strategy); patient experiences disease progression while being treated with all agents that are components of the initial treatment strategy (except for agents which cannot be used because of persistent toxicity or contraindications); or patient experiences disease progression during a partial or complete treatment holiday from initial treatment strategy and receives no further therapy within 3 months. Subjects who did not have an event as stated above while on study will be censored at the last evaluable radiographic assessment date., from randomization to: death; patient requires a new therapeutic agent; PD on treatment with all agents of the initial strategy; PD during a partial or complete treatment holiday and receives no further therapy within 3 months, up to 18 months after LPLV|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from randomization to the date of death due to any cause. For patients still alive at the time of analysis, the OS time will be censored on the last date the patients were known to be alive., from randomization to the date of death due to any cause up to 18 months after last patient last visit|Objective Response Rate, percentage of patients, relative to the total of enrolled subjects, achieving a complete (CR) or partial (PR) response, according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, during the induction and the maintenance phases of treatment., Every 8 weeks, up to 18 months after last patient last visit|Toxicity Rate, Toxicity Rate is defined as the percentage of patients, relative to the total of enrolled subjects, experiencing a specific adverse event of grade 3/4, according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (version 4.0), during the induction and the maintenance phases of treatment., At every cycle of treatment up to the second evidence of PD or up to 18 months after LPLV
