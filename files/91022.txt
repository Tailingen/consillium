Clinical Study on SyB L-0501 in Patients With Indolent B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma or Mantle Cell Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to assess the antitumor effects and safety of bendamustine hydrochloride (SyB L-0501) in patients with indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or mantle cell lymphoma.
Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma|Mantle Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: bendamustine hydrochloride
Overall response rate based on [Report of an International Workshop to Standardize Response Criteria for Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas], [Treatment period]
CR rate of overall results based on [Report of an International Workshop to Standardize Response Criteria for Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas], [Treatment Period]
Indolent B-cell Non-hodgkin's lymphoma is treated mainly with radiation and chemotherapy using a combination of chemotherapies, such as purine-analogues and CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone). After the approval of an antibody therapy agent RituximabÂ®, it alone or combination with CHOP has been introduced. Bendamustine hydrochloride has a unique structure compared with the marketed agents, and has an innovative mechanism of action. Thus, it is expected that Bendamustine hydrochloride will provide new alternatives for patients with refractory/recurrent indolent B-cell Non-hodgkin's lymphoma.
