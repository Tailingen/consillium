Study of NOVOTTF-200A in Bevacizumab-Naive Subjects with Recurrent Grade III Malignant Astrocytoma
This is a Phase 2 study in subjects with WHO Grade III Anaplastic Astrocytoma (G3 astrocytoma) who had progressive disease during first or second line treatment and who have not previously received any BEV or any experimental agents.
Astrocytoma, Grade III
DEVICE: NOVOTTF-200A
Number of participants showing no evidence of disease progression six months after initiating treatment with the device., The primary objective is to estimate the proportion of participants showing no evidence of disease progression six months after initiating treatment with the device. Assessment is per RANO (2010) criteria., 6 months
Evaluation of the safety of NOVOTTF-200A in this subject population., All subjects will be evaluated for safety analysis if they receive NOVOTTF-200A. Safety and tolerability of NOVOTTF-200A treatment will be based on the incidence and severity of adverse events and toxicities. Toxicities will be assessed according to the "Common toxicity criteria (CTC), version 4.03"., 1 year|Does the treatment significantly modify the patient's quality of life?, To determine if the treatment significantly modifies the patient's quality of life we will be using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) questionnaires that include the FACT-Brain (FACT-Br), and the FACT-Cognitive Function (FACT-Cog) questionnaires. These will be completed at baseline then every two cycles., Will be assessed at baseline and every two cycles (at the end of each even-numbered cycle of therapy) until treatment termination, an average of 24 months|Correlations with established molecular markers (ATRX, TERT promoter and/or IDH1 mutation and MGMT promoter methylation, To see if the presence of ATRX, TERT promoter, IDH1 mutations and/or MGMT promoter methylation, confers a better response to NOVOTTF-200A., Will be assessed at screening and at end of treatment visit, an average of 24 months
Primary Objective:

The primary objective will be to determine the efficacy of NOVOTTF-200A in recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma patients (6-month progression-free survival)

Secondary Objectives:

* To evaluate the safety of NOVOTTF-200A in the subject population.
* To evaluate efficacy of NOVOTTF-200A in the subject population.
* To see if the presence of ATRX, TERT promoter, IDH1 mutations and/or MGMT promoter methylation, confers a better response to NOVOTTF-200A.
* To determine if the treatment significantly modifies the patient's quality of life. Sponsor will use the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) questionnaires:

  * FACT-Brain (FACT-Br)
  * FACT-Cognitive Function (FACT-Cog)

Exploratory Objectives:

* To determine if the presence of proneural or mesenchymal phenotype (Cytoscan analysis) confers a better response to NovoTTF.
* To determine if the in vitro sensitivity of the glioma cells derived from patient specimens before and after the NOVOTTF-200A treatment correlates with the patient's response to treatment.
