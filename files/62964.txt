Prevention of Skin Cancer in High Risk Patients After Conversion to a Sirolimus-based Immunosuppressive Protocol
Transplant recipients have a high risk to develop skin malignancies. This effect depends on the one hand on the immunosuppressive drugs themselves (i.e., azathioprine) and relates on the other hand on the dosage (i.e., calcineurin-inhibitors). Based on the encouraging results of previous, retrospective studies on patients treated with Sirolimus (SRL), these patients should be switched to an immunosuppressive regime including SRL, decreasing the dosage of calcineurin-inhibitors or converting from former immunosuppression. A conversion to a SRL-based therapy is effective in immunosuppression and safe regarding graft and patient survival.

This study was designed to assess whether a switch to a SRL-immunosuppressive therapy decreases the incidence/reoccurrence of skin neoplasm.
Skin Cancer
DRUG: Sirolimus|DRUG: Azathioprine|DRUG: Mycophenolate|DRUG: Ciclosporin|DRUG: Tacrolimus
Number of Events of Reoccurrence of Skin Cancer, Progression of actinic keratosis I and II to III or invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) or incidence/reoccurrence of neoplastic skin tumors (namely SCC, basal cell carcinoma, keratoacanthoma, Bowen's disease, precancerous keratoses, actinic keratoses III), 24 month
Patients who meet all inclusion criteria will be included into the study and randomised. If converted to SRL, patients will take SRL according to the investigator's instructions and medication label, once daily preferably 4 hours after calcineurin-inhibitor medication or in case without calcineurin-inhibitor co-medication in the morning. The dose of SRL will be correlated to the former immunosuppressive therapy according to the study's conversion protocol.
