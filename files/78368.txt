Feasibility Study of LUM Imaging System for Pancreatic Cancer
This single-site, non-randomized, open-label study to assess the initial safety and efficacy of the LUM Imaging System for detection of primary pancreatic cancer and peritoneal invasion from primary pancreatic cancer during surgery. In this feasibility study, the tumor detection algorithm will be developed for this indication.
Pancreatic Cancer
COMBINATION_PRODUCT: LUM Imaging System
Assess the initial safety and efficacy of the LUM Imaging System for detection of primary pancreatic cancer and peritoneal invasion from primary pancreatic cancer during surgery, Reported adverse events will be assessed and aggregated according to event type, relation to device or drug, and severity., 10-14 days
Correlate resected tissue with LUM Imaging System to identify imaging threshold, Findings from imaging results with the LUM System will be correlated with pathology assessment of the resected tissue., 10-14 days
This study is being conducted to see if LUM015 can be safely given to human patients before surgery at a dose that allows the removed tumor tissue to be identified when imaged by the LUM imaging device.

Up to 30 subjects will be enrolled in this study. Subjects will be administered with LUM015 at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg. Due to the expected duration of these surgeries (up to 14 hours), all subjects will require LUM015 administration intraoperatively.

The sequence of events during the surgical procedure will vary based on the standard of care used by the surgeon. Study treatment ends when the surgery is completed. All patients will continue their enrollment in the study until their first follow-up visit and they will continue to be followed until the medical team determines no further surgical intervention is required. Patients with adverse events that are determined to be possibly related to the LUM Imaging System will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.
