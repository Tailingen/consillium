Durvalumab and Ablative Radiation in Small Cell Lung Cancer (DARES)
This this study is for individuals who have treatment-naïve extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (small cell lung cancer that wont respond to treatment). Doctors leading this study hope to learn if combining durvalumab, carboplatin and etoposide with hyofractionated ablative radiation therapy (radiation focused on certain parts of the body) will help treat your cancer and improve how long you can live with extensive-stage small cell cancer without it getting worse (progression-free survival). Your participation in this research will last about 48 months.

Durvalumab along with chemotherapy has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of small cell lung cancer along with chemotherapy. This study is testing the addition of radiation to durvalumab and chemotherapy.

Progression-Free Survival of Participant Until Disease Progression or Death, The progression-free survival (PFS) of subjects with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer treated with durvalumab, carboplatin and etoposide with hypofractionated ablative radiation therapy. Progression-free survival will be defined as the time from start of treatment until disease progression per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECISTv1.1) or death from any cause., 48 months
Rate of Participants with Grade 3/4 Adverse Events After 3 Months According to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, The rate of participants with serious adverse events by organ system that occur within three months of starting radiation, according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5., 3 months|Overall Survival Rate of Participants After Treatment with Chemotherapy, Durvalumab and Ablative Radiation, The overall survival rate of participants after treatment with chemotherapy, durvalumab, and hypofractionated ablative radiotherapy., 48 months|Time to Second-Line Therapy, Time to second-line therapy (from start of treatment until second-line therapy is needed) as assessed by clinical records., 48 months|Time to New, Distant Lesions, Time to development of new distant lesions as assessed clinical records., 48 months|Progression Free Survival at 12 Months, The progression-free survival (PFS) of subjects with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer treated with durvalumab, carboplatin and etoposide with hypofractionated ablative radiation therapy at 12 months. Progression-free survival will be defined as the time from start of treatment to 12 months per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1)., 12 months
