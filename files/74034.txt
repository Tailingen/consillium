Analyzing Clinical Outcomes and Genomic Data of American Indian Patient Population
The aim of this study is to describe the outcomes in American Indian patients receiving immunotherapy in a multi-institution retrospective study at several other high-volume centers that care for this patient population and to identify any healthcare disparities that can lead to future interventional studies.

BIOLOGICAL: Immunotherapy
Progression Free Survival, Evaluating progression free survival of American Indian population vs. White population who were treated with immunotherapy, 1 year|Overall Survival Benefit, Evaluating the overall survival benefit of American Indian population vs. white population who were treated with immunotherapy, 1 year|Treatment related Adverse Events, Evaluating treatment related adverse events of American Indian population vs. white population who were treated with immunotherapy, 1 year
Difference in cancer related mortality, Evaluate the difference in cancer related mortality in American Indian populations vs white, 1 year
Tumor mutational burden, Describe the differences in tumor mutational burden (TMB) between the American Indian population vs Whites or Black Americans, 1 year|Somatic genetic variants, Describe the somatic genetic variants differences between the American Indian population vs Whites or Black Americans, 1 year|Demographic differences, Describe the demographics differences between the American Indian population vs Whites or Black Americans, 1 year
Immune checkpoint inhibitors have been shown to increase survival in metastatic solid tumor patients when compared to the previously standard of care chemotherapy. Epidemiologic studies of American Indian cancer patients demonstrated having significantly worse survival when compared with Caucasians when controlled for age, sex, alcohol abuse, smoking, insurance, and disease stage.

There are no current studies specifically examining the American Indian population receiving treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors. The aim is to describe the outcomes in American Indian patients receiving immunotherapy in a multi-institution retrospective study at several other high-volume centers that care for this patient population and to identify any healthcare disparities that can lead to future interventional studies.
