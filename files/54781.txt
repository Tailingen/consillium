This is a first-in-human, open-label, phase 1, sequential dose escalation study. Emerfetamab will be evaluated as a short term intravenous (IV) infusion in adults with relapsed/refractory AML The study will consist of a dose escalation phase and a dose expansion phase. The study was terminated prior to the start of the expansion phase.
