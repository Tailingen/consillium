A Study of APS03118 in Advanced Solid Tumors Harboring RET Mutations or Fusions
This is a Phase 1, open-label, first-in-human (FIH) study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and preliminary antineoplastic activity of APS03118 administered orally in participants with RET-altered solid tumors.
RET-altered Solid Tumors
DRUG: APS03118
Incidence of DLTs during Cycle 1 in dose-escalation cohorts, Within the 28 days of the first APS03118 dose for each patient|The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and / or recommended Phase II dose (RP2D), The MTD is defined as the maximum dose at which the incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) during Cycle 1 is below 30%(\<2/6), Approximately 15 months
Adverse events(AE), Approximately 24 months|Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Up to approximately 1 month|Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), Up to approximately 1 month|Time to Maximum Concentration (Tmax), Up to approximately 1 month|Degree of accumulation, Up to approximately 1 month|Overall Response Rate (ORR), As assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), Up to approximately 24 months|Duration of response (DOR), Up to approximately 24 months|Best of response (BOR), Up to approximately 24 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Up to approximately 24 months|Progress Free Survival (PFS), Up to approximately 24 months
After being informed about the study procedure and potential risks and benefits, all patients giving written informed consent will undergo a 4-week screening period to determine eligibility for study entry. The eligible participants will be enrolled using a rolling 6 dose escalation scheme to identify MTD and/or RP2D.
