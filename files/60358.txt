Evolution of the Physical Condition in Treated Cancer Patients
Adaptated Physical Activity (APA) during treatment of cancer is one of the actual global health recommendation because of the benefits observed in several parameters evaluated in many clinical studies. A best knowledge of the physical and medical characteristics of patients, including type of cancer and type of treatment, is primordial to optimize the patient care and the effectiveness of APA programs.

Descriptive, explorative and prospective study of 3 different populations:

One population with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer treated with multiple therapeutic lines. Two different populations of early cancer patients and treated with a platinum-based regimen for colon cancer and a taxane-based chemotherapy for breast cancer.
