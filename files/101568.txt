Fluorescence Molecular Endoscopy and Molecular Fluorescence-guided Surgery in Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer
Treatment of patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) is multidisciplinary and consists of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) followed by surgical removal of the rectal tumor and potentially tumor positive lymph nodes.

1. After surgery, in 15 to 27% of patients that received nCRT no tumor cells can be detected during histopathological examination. In today's clinical practice, all of these patients with a pathological complete response (pCR) are operated upon, with substantial morbidity and mortality. The 5-year survival is 83.3% for patients with a pCR, and 65.6% for those without pCR. Response after nCRT is currently evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, as MRI cannot differentiate between molecular characteristics of tissue, prediction of treatment response can be inaccurate. In patients with a potential cCR on MRI, additionally a high-definition white-light (HD-WL) endoscopy is performed with biopsies of the previous tumor location. If both MRI and HD-WL endoscopy confirm a potential cCR, patients can also be treated with a watch-and-wait approach, including frequent follow-up with HD-WL endoscopy and MRI. This potentially prevents extensive surgical procedures for patients in which this is not required. However, MRI and HD-WL endoscopy often remain insufficient for identification of cCR. Therefore, novel imaging methods are needed for accurate prediction of treatment response in order to select patients. The investigators believe fluorescence molecular endoscopy (FME) could be a promising technique for evaluation of treatment response.
2. During surgery, tumor-negative resection margins are of great prognostic value. Currently, surgeons rely on visual and tactile inspection for differentiation between malignant and healthy tissue. When in doubt, a frozen section can be obtained, which is time consuming and poses a high risk of sampling error. However, 14.7% of patients still have tumor-positive resection margins, increasing the risk of local recurrence and worsening outcome. Therefore, there is a need for novel imaging techniques that can be used intraoperatively to improve margin assessment. The investigators believe molecular fluorescence-guided surgery (MFGS) could be a promising technique for evaluation of resection margins.
