Study of Dasatinib (BMS-354825) in Patients With Accelerated Phase Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
The purpose of this clinical research study is to learn if BMS-354825 will have activity, defined by hematologic response, in subjects who have accelerated phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who are resistant to or intolerant to imatinib mesylate.
