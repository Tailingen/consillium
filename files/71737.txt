Medical and Economic Evaluation for Intermediate-risk Prostate Cancer
The aim of the present phase III study is two-folded: 1) to show a superiority of external beam radiotherapy combined with a brachytherapy boost versus exclusive external beam radiotherapy and 2) to evaluate the economic impact of each treatment.

The study includes 33 cancer centres, the inclusion time is of 2 years and the follow-up is of 5 years.
Prostate Cancer
RADIATION: Brachytherapy boost with external beam radiotherapy|RADIATION: Exclusive external beam radiotherapy
Comparison of the biochemical relapse free survival of the patients in two groups at 5 years for an external beam radiotherapy with a brachytherapy boost versus an exclusive external beam radiotherapy, Biochemical relapse is defined using the Phoenix definition of nadir of Prostate Specific Antigen + 2 ng/ml. This will be studied for both arms, 5 years
The evaluation of the overall survival at 5 years., All cause mortality, 5 years|The evaluation of the specific survival at 5 years, Mortality due to prostate cancer, 5 years|The evaluation of the survival without any metastatic evolution at 5 years, 5 years|The study of all toxicities, The toxicities include: acute and late toxicities, sexual toxicities, the quality of life of the patients (CTCAE version 4.0), 5 years|Medical and economical evaluation., The complete medical and economical evaluation of the strategies, 5 years
