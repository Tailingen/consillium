A Trial of HTI-1090 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors
IDO1 is expressed in a wide variety of human tumors (eg. bladder, breast, colon, DLBCL, HNSCC, lung, ovarian, uterine, renal...), and contributes to tumoral resistance. HTI-1090 (also referred as SHR9146 in nonclinical study reports) is an orally bioavailable, highly potent, novel small-molecule IDO1/TDO dual inhibitor, with favorable preclinical oral bioavailability and safety profiles.

This is an open-label, dose escalation, phase I, study of HTI-1090 (also known as SHR9146), a small molecule that inhibits both indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) - two enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of L-tryptophan (Trp) into kynurenine (Kyn), thereby interrupting the immune escape and the attainment of immunologic tolerance. Dose escalation will use a modified "3+3" design and continue until a MTD or RP2D is identified. This study will also characterize the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of HTI-1090 in subjects with advanced solid tumors.
