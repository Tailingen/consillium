Clinical Trial Comparing Carnoy's and GEWF Solutions for Lymph Node Clearing Technique in Colorectal Cancer
Regional lymph node metastasis is a major determinant of local recurrence and overall survival rates in patients with colorectal cancer. Because of the poor prognosis associated with the presence of lymph node metastasis, stage III colorectal cancer patients should receive adjuvant treatment with chemo and / or radiation therapy according to the site of tumor. Several authors have investigated the use of revealing solutions for lymph node clearance in colorectal cancer. Most studies comparing conventional histopathological specimen examination to any lymph node clearing technique showed that the use of revealing solutions increases the mean number of lymph nodes harvested, usually in a statistically significant manner. It is still controversial the impact of the use of revealing solutions for upstaging of lymph node status and consequently for the indication for adjuvant therapy. Therefore will be conducted a randomized clinical trial to compares the performance of GEWF and Carnoy solutions for the histopathological examination of patients with colorectal cancer. The aim of this study is to determine the lymph node revealing solution with the best performance (increase in the mean number of lymph node harvested and lymph node upstaging) in patients with colorectal cancer.
Colorectal Neoplasms|Neoplasm Metastasis
OTHER: Lymph node clearing technique with Carnoy solution|OTHER: Lymph node clearing technique with GEWF solution
Lymph nodes harvested, Number of additional lymph nodes harvested with the clearing technique, One week
Lymph node metastasis, Presence of metastasis in the additional lymph nodes harvested, One week|Upstage of lymph nodes, Diagnosis of lymph node metastasis in a patient initially classified as having no lymph node metastasis or increase in the number of metastatic lymph nodes in a patient already staged as having lymph node metastasis., One week|Adjuvant therapy, Indication of adjuvant therapy as consequence of the upstaging after the lymph nodes clearing technique., One month
Patients with histologically proven colorectal adenocarcinoma submitted to curative resection and conventional histopathological examination of the surgical specimen are randomized to undergo further investigation by lymph node clearing technique with Carnoy or GEWF solution.
