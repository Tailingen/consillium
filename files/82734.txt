Surgery is the main treatment for localized prostate cancer. The most common technique is a "radical prostatectomy," which involves removing the prostate gland, seminal vesicles and nearby lymph nodes. Radical prostatectomy is a major operation, most suitable for otherwise healthy men whose cancer does not appear to have spread.One of the most technically challenging aspects of this surgery is reconstruction of the interrupted urinary tract by hand suturing the bladder neck anastomosis, in which the bladder neck is sewn to the urethra after the prostate has been removed.

CONTINUUM™ (study Device) is a surgical device intended to be used as part of the radical prostatectomy procedure. The Device facilitates approximation of the bladder neck and urethral stump by bringing together and holding the tissue in place until adequate natural healing of the vesico-urethral anastomosis occurs. CONTINUUM™ also approximates the bladder and urethral stump to minimize extravasation, while simultaneously providing a conduit for drainage of urine from the bladder while the anastomotic site heals.

The concept of the CONTINUUM™ device and the feasibility of its operation have been tested in animal and human studies. Pilot clinical studies in the United States (G060095) found that the majority of Subjects who received and were discharged with the Device demonstrated a water-tight vesico-urethral anastomosis at the first Device removal visit. Additionally, no unanticipated adverse device effects (UADEs) were reported. The intent of this study is to verify CONTINUUM™ device performance across a variety of US sites and physicians using updated CONTINUUM™ device design modifications and physician training methodology on Device implant and removal techniques prior to initiation of a randomized US Pivotal study.
