A Randomized Controlled Trial of Routine Shave Margins Versus Standard Partial Mastectomy in Breast Cancer Patients
This research study is designed to look at whether the routine use of shave margins (by taking extra tissue at the time of partial mastectomy surgery) will reduce the chances of having positive surgical margins requiring another surgical procedure, and whether this affects the long-term chances of getting cancer back in your breast.

PROCEDURE: Shave margins|PROCEDURE: No Shave Margins
Optimal surgical treatment, To determine whether routine shave margins in breast cancer patients undergoing partial mastectomy will result in more optimal surgical treatment of breast cancer patients, as defined by reduced positive margin rates, 12 months
