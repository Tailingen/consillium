Doxorubicin-loaded Anti-EGFR-immunoliposomes (C225-ILs-dox) in High-grade Gliomas
Anti-EGFR-immunoliposomes loaded with doxorubicin (C225-ILs-dox) are given intravenously in patients with relapsed or refractory high-grade gliomas.

The pharmacokinetics of C225-ILs-dox in peripheral blood (PB), cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) and resected tumour tissue will be assessed.
