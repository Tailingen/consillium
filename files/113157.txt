Frequency and Risk Factors of Acute Myeloid Leukemia
1. to assess the frequency of acute myeloid leukemia at clinical Haematology unit of Assiute university hospital
2. to study correlations of known risk factors and if there are new risk factors participate in increasing frequency of acute myeloid leukemia
Myeloid Leukemia
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Bone marrow aspirite for diagnosis
Frequency of acute myeloid leukemia at clinical Haemtology unit of Assiute university hospital, Two years
Risk factors of acute myeloid leukemia at clinical Haemtology unit of Assiute university hospital, Two years
Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a rare heterogeneous disease comprising a group of hematopoietic neoplasms originating from the excessive clonal proliferation of myeloid pre- cursor cells \[1\]. Diagnosis of AML is based on morphological diagnosis with proliferation of blast cells â‰¥ 20% of bone marrow cells, flow cytometric analysis and cytogenetic abnormalities, including the t(8;21)(q22;q22), t(15;17) (q22;q12) and inv (16)(p13.1;q22) which are associated with longer remission and survival, while alterations of chromosomes 5, 7, complex karyotype and 11q23 are associated with poor response to therapy and shorter overall survival \[2\] The etiological agent and pathogenesis of AML are not entirely clear, only few AML cases can be accurately classified through traditional cellular morphological classification \[3\]It is the most common acute leukaemia in adults. It accounts for 1.3% of new cancer patients in the United States, in 2018\[ 4\] Some factors are well documented to increase the risk of some types of leukemia such as benzene exposure and ionizing radiation \[5\] increased frequency of acute myeloid leukemia has been noticed at Haematology unit so the aim of the study to assess the the frequency of acute myeloid leukemia and to evaluate the risk factors for it .
