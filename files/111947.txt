A Phase I Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of JS004 in Advanced Solid Tumors
An open-label, dose-escalation, phase I clinical study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of JS004 injection in the patients with advanced solid tumors who have failure in standard of care and are unable to tolerate standard of care and/or have no available standard of care. The study is divided into screening period, treatment period, and follow-up period.

1. Screening period: Subjects will be included in the screening period after signing the informed consent form (ICF). The screening period is up to 28 days, subjects will enter the study treatment period if they meet all the inclusion criteria and none of exclusion criterion.
2. Treatment period: Subjects will be allocated to the designated dose group to receive corresponding treatment in accordance with the progress of study. Subjects in dose escalation phase will receive DLT observation at first, and upon completion of DLT observation, the subjects will continue their administration at the original dose if they are tolerated as judged by investigator, until progression of disease, intolerable toxicity or other reasons specified in the protocol. Subjects in the dose extension phase receive appropriate study treatment until disease progression, intolerance of toxicity, or other causes specified in the protocol occur. Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST v1.1) will be used for efficacy evaluation every 9 weeks (±7 days) in the first year and every 12 weeks (±7 days) in the 2nd year and thereafter.
3. Follow-up period: A safety follow-up visit is required 30 days (±7 days) after the last dose of study drug or before the initiation of new antitumor therapy. If the new antitumor therapy has not been initiated, additional safety follow-up should be completed 90 days (±7 days) after the last dose as far as possible.
