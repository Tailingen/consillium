64Cu-LLP2A for Imaging Multiple Myeloma
The investigators are performing a trial with goals to demonstrate the feasibility of imaging multiple myeloma (MM) patients with 64Cu-LLP2A-positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance (MR). The investigators suggest that 64Cu-LLP2A will allow for an accurate molecular imaging of MM lesions, which will have an important impact on early stage disease detection and in the long term on the initiation and choice of therapy in these patients.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: 64Cu-LLP2A|DEVICE: PET/MR|PROCEDURE: Blood samples for serum stability|PROCEDURE: Blood samples for metabolite analysis|PROCEDURE: Urine sample|PROCEDURE: Tumor biopsy|PROCEDURE: Electrocardiogram|DEVICE: PET/CT
Feasibility of imaging MM patients with 64Cu-LLP2A-PET/MR as measured by average organ activity concentration of 64Cu-LLP2A, -Average organ activity concentration will be measured and decay corrected by utilizing regions of interest (ROIs) drawn around all organs visible on 64Cu-LLP2A images. Activity organ residence times will be calculated by numerical or analytical integration of the time-activity curves. Uptake/clearance functional fits of mono or bi-exponential functions will be performed and analytical integration, accounted for physical delay, will be performed. The calculated residence times will be used with the program OLINDA/EXM for 64Cu and using the adult human (male/femal) model to calculate the individual organ radiation dose, the whole-body dose, and the effective dose, Up to 30 hours after imaging|Feasibility of imaging MM patients with 64Cu-LLP2A-PET/MR as measured by the number of participants who experience an adverse event related to 64Cu-LLP2A, -The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for all toxicity reporting., Through 48 hours after last administration of 64Cu-LLP2A (estimated to be at most 4 days)|Feasibility of imaging MM patients with 64Cu-LLP2A-PET/MR as measured by the optimal image time after injection of 64Cu-LLP2A, -The optimal imaging time after injection yields the best image quality and tumor-to-non-tumor ratio for visual and quantitative analysis of the lesions, Up to 30 hours after imaging|Feasibility of imaging MM patients with 64Cu-LLP2A-PET/MR as measured by image quality of 64Cu-LLP2A-PET/MR images, * Overall PET image quality will be graded visually (using 4-point scale with 1 being the worst and poor quality, not acceptable for diagnostic interpretation and 4 being good image quality, similar to routine clinical studies).
* The images will be assessed by independent observers (a nuclear medicine expert in evaluating PET images using novel radiotracers, and a MR radiologist expert in evaluating MR images
* The images will then be correlated to MRI (and biopsy if available) to assess whether the lesions identified on 64Cu-LLP2A correspond to myeloma lesions, Up to 30 hours after imaging|Feasibility of imaging MM patients with 64Cu-LLP2A-PET/MR as measured by lesion detection of 64Cu-LLP2A-PET/MR images, -Lesion detection is measured by lesion uptake in comparison with the surrounding tissue, Up to 30 hours after imaging
Comparison of tumor burden (SUVmax) of 64Cu-LLP2A to clinical stage, -SUVmax is a mathematical measurement of tumor burden seen on images and calculated by the following equation SUVmax= r / (a'/w) where r= radioactivity concentration in tumor (kBq/ml) as measured by the PET scanner within a defined region of interest, a'=the decay corrected amount of injected 64Cu-LLP2A and w= weight of the patient in grams When PET imaging shows uptake of 64Cyu-LLP2A in site(s) of known tumor the SUVmax will be compared to overall clinical stage as a way to compare accuracy of imaging to known clinical stage, Up to 30 hours after imaging|Comparison of tumor burden (SUVmax) of 64Cu-LLP2A to clinical tumor measurement of tumor burden as measured by M-protein of myeloma, SUVmax is a mathematical measurement of tumor burden seen on images and calculated by the following equation SUVmax= r / (a'/w) where r= radioactivity concentration in tumor (kBq/ml) as measured by the PET scanner within a defined region of interest, a'=the decay corrected amount of injected 64Cu-LLP2A and w= weight of the patient in grams When PET imaging shows uptake of 64Cyu-LLP2A in site(s) of known tumor the SUVmax will be compared to clinical measurement of tumor burden as seen by the laboratory values for M-protein (lab measurement for myeloma gamma globulin which is increased in multiple myleom due to an abnormal monoclonal proliferation of plasma cells), Up to 30 hours after imaging|Comparision of tumor burden (SUVmax) of 64Cu-LLP2A to clinical measurement of tumor burden as measured by the plasma cell fraction within the bone marrow, * Hierarchical models will be used to estimate the correlation of SUVmax with M-protein expression
