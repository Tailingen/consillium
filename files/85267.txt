An Analysis of Treatment Patterns and Outcomes for Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) Cancer Participants
This multi-center, observational study involves reviewing the medical records of approximately 100 adult participants diagnosed with advanced BCC from 01 January 2005 until 31 December 2010. Participant records will be analyzed to identify participant characteristics, treatment patterns and clinical outcomes.
