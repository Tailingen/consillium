A Phase 1 Study of SHR2554 in Subjects With Relapsed or Refractory Mature Lymphoid Neoplasms
This is a Phase 1 multicenter, single-arm, open-label, dose escalation and dose expansion study of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2 ) inhibitor SHR2554.

This study will assess the tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of SHR2554 in participants with relapsed or refractory mature lymphoid neoplasms in part I, and the the efficacy in PTCL patients will be studied in Part II.
