This study is a single-arm, open label, multicenter phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SG001 in combination with nab-paclitaxel in patients with unresectable locally advanced, or recurrent, or metastatic TNBC. Eligible patients will receive SG001 intravenous infusion at a dose of 240 mg on Days 1 and 15 of every 4-week cycle and nab-paclitaxel intravenous infusion at a dose of 100 mg/m\^2 on Days 1, 8, and 15 of every 4-week cycle until disease progression, or intolerable toxicity, or other discontinuation or termination criteria are met, for a maximum of 2 years.
