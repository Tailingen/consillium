Serplulimab for Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) With TPS ≥ 50%: a Prospective, Single-center, Single-arm Phase 2 Study.
The goal of this clinical trial is to observe the efficacy and safety of Serplulimab monotherapy as a neoadjuvant treatment for TPS ≥ 50% non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer|PDL1 Gene Mutation
DRUG: Serplulimab
Pathologic Complete Response Rate, pCR, Assessed 1 month after surgery|Major Pahological Response, MPR, Assessed 1 month after surgery|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Proportion of patients with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) to preoperative multimodal therapy. ORR will be evaluated using RESIST1.1 by CT of the chest., From the time of enrollment, assessed up to 5 years follow-up.
Overall survival (OS), The time from enrollment to death due to any reason. The time from enrollment to death due to any reason. The time from enrollment to death due to any reason., From the time of enrollment, assessed up to 5 years follow-up.|Event-Free Survival(EFS), The time from enrollment to disease progression or death from any cause., From the time of enrollment, assessed up to 5 years follow-up.
The study aims to explore new strategies for neoadjuvant treatment of resectable NSCLC patients with TPS ≥ 50%, and to identify potential prognostic biomarkers.

Participants with stage ⅠB-ⅢA and TPS ≥ 50% non-small cell lung cancer, excluding EGFR and ALK gene mutations will receive 4 cycles of Serplulimab monotherapy at 4.5mg/kg as neoadjuvant treatment before surgery. Subsequently, they will undergo surgical resection and evaluation of the effect of neoadjuvant therapy. 14 cycles of Serplulimab as adjuvant treatment. Participants will provide blood samples before neoadjuvant treatment, before the third cycle of neoadjuvant treatment, before surgery, and 4-7 days after surgery for Minimal Residual Disease（MRD） detection to assist in evaluating the treatment effect.
