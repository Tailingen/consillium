A Phase 1 Study to Evaluate the Potential Drug Interactions Between Repotrectinib and Metformin, Digoxin, and Rosuvastatin in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1 study to evaluate the potential drug-drug interaction (DDI) effect of repotrectinib on certain drug transporters in patients with advanced cancer.
Advanced Solid Tumor|Metastatic Solid Tumor
DRUG: TPX-0005|DRUG: Metformin Hydrochloride|DRUG: Digoxin|DRUG: Rosuvastatin Calcium
Area under plasma-concentration time curve, AUC0-t: area under the plasma-concentration time curve from time 0 to time of the last measurable concentration. AUC0-inf: area under the plasma-concentration time curve from time 0 to infinity (if data permit)., Within 28 days of first cocktail dose|Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration, Cmax: maximum observed plasma concentration, Within 28 days of first cocktail dose
Evaluate safety and tolerability, To evaluate the safety and tolerability of repotrectinib in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment and patients with normal hepatic function following single and multiple dose administration of repotrectinib assessed by CTCAE v5.0, Within 28 days of first cocktail dose
This is a Phase 1, open-label, fixed-sequence study to evaluate the potential drug-drug interaction (DDI) effect of repotrectinib on drug transporters (metformin, digoxin and rosuvastatin) following multiple dose administration of repotrectinib in patients with advanced cancer harboring ROS1 and NTRK1 Rearrangements.
