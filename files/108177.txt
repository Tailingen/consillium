A Study of the Safety and Tolerability of the Addition of CHR-2797 to Paclitaxel in Patients With Advanced or Refractory Tumours
The treatment of cancer often involves the use of more than one drug at the same time. In this study, patients are treated with the already marketed drug paclitaxel (administered every 3 weeks by infusion)and with the investigational drug CHR-2797 (given orally, once daily). The purpose of this study is to evaluate if it is safe to administer these two drugs together, and how well the combination is tolerated by patients. The first patients will receive a 90mg dose of CHR-2797; doses will be increased in subsequent patients, as long as they are adequately tolerated.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: CHR-2797
To determine the safety, tolerability, dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CHR-2797 when administered in combination with paclitaxel., 18 weeks
To evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of the combination of CHR-2797 and paclitaxel and identify any pharmacokinetic interaction between the 2 agents., After 1st and 2nd infusion of paclitaxel|To determine response and response duration, time to progressive disease or treatment failure during combination therapy and in those patients who continued beyond 18 weeks on monotherapy with CHR-2797., Maximum duration of patient treatment ( combination followed by monotherapy) was 9 months
