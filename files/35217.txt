Relatlimab With Nivolumab and 5-Azacytidine for the Treatment of AML
The clinical trial will test the safety and tolerability of a combination therapy (azacitidine in combination with two checkpoint inhibitors, nivolumab \[Anti-PD1\] and relatlimab \[Anti-LAG3\]) in patients with relapsed/refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and patients ≥ 65 years with initial diagnosis of AML.

Primary objectives are:

* maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of the combination therapy during the lead-in phase of the clinical trial (6-12 patients) and
* objective response rate (ORR) of the combination therapy in the phase II part of the study (up to 24 patients).
