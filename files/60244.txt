DEVICE: Location of the suspected lesions|PROCEDURE: Biopsy|PROCEDURE: Lesion excision/Surgery
Reliability for detection of subclinical lesions, Concordance between the histological data and the lesions detected by the NBI technique, baseline
Excision limits quality criteria, percentage of detection / percentage of false-negative, baseline|Detection of suspect lesions, Identify the detection of suspect lesions, aloof from the primitive lesion (percentage of detection / percentage of true-positive), baseline
