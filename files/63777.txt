Noninterventional Examination of Subcutaneous (sc) Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) Inhibitors
This prospective, post marketing, observational, Noninterventional Study (NIS) is designed to compare drug persistence in patients treated with Certolizumab Pegol (CZP) and patients treated with any other subcutaneously (sc) administered Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) inhibitor.
Rheumatoid Arthritis
Proportion of patients demonstrating persistence to the initially prescribed Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) inhibitor after 24 months of treatment, For a patient to be classified as persistent he or she must be classified as an early responder up to Week 12 and be continuously treated up to Week 104 with the initially prescribed Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) inhibitor at a dose not greater than that initially prescribed according to the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC).

For the definition of persistence rate for the primary variable, patients will be classified as early responders if their Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) shows a reduction of \>=1.2 from Baseline or decreases to \<=3.2 (Low Disease Activity (LDA) or remission) up to Week 12.

Non responders up to Week 12 will be counted as non persistent to the initially prescribed TNF inhibitor treatment.

Patients who stop the initially prescribed TNF inhibitor treatment will not be counted as persistent, except if treatment with TNF inhibitor is stopped because the patient is in clinical remission., up to Week 104
Proportion of patients achieving early clinical response to treatment based on Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) reduction of ≥ 1.2 or DAS28 decrease to ≤ 3.2 up to Week 12, From Baseline up to Week 12|Proportion of patients achieving early clinical response to treatment based on DAS28 reduction of ≥ 1.2 or DAS28 decrease to ≤ 3.2, and being in DAS28 remission (DAS28<2.6) or ([LDA] DAS28<=3.2) at Week 104, * LDA is defined as DAS28 ≤ 3.2
* DAS28 is defined as Disease Activity Score 28, From Baseline up to Week 12 and to Week 104|Proportion of patients not achieving early clinical response to treatment based on DAS28 reduction of >=1.2 or DAS28 decrease to <=3.2, and being in DAS28 remission (DAS28<2.6) or LDA (DAS28<=3.2) at Week 104, * LDA is defined as DAS28 ≤ 3.2
