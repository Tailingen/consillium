A Clinical Study of Transaxillary Endoscopic and Open Thyroidectomy for PTC
To evaluate the feasibility and safety of gasless transaxillary posterior endoscopic thyroidectomy (Resection of thyroid lobe and isthmus, lymph node dissection in the central area of the affected side) and open radical thyroidectomy (Resection of thyroid lobe and isthmus, lymph node dissection in the central area of the affected side) as the current standard surgical treatment mode in terms of feasibility and safety of radical thyroidectomy.
Papillary Thyroid Cancer
PROCEDURE: GTPET(Gasless Transaxillary Posterial Endoscopic Thyroidectomy)|PROCEDURE: COT(Conventional Open Thyroidectomy)
Early complication rate, Early complications include hemorrhage, surgical site infection, recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, hypoparathyroidism (PTH\<15pg/ml, or showing hypocalcification symptoms), chyle leakage, trachea injury, esophageal injury, etc., 30 days after surgery|Life quality score (3 days after surgery), Use a modified Thyroid Cancer-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (THYCA-QOL) to measure the quality of life 3 days after surgery., 3 days after surgery|Life quality score (1 month after surgery), Use a modified Thyroid Cancer-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (THYCA-QOL) to measure the quality of life 1 month after surgery., 1 month after surgery|Life quality score (3 months after surgery), Use a modified Thyroid Cancer-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (THYCA-QOL) to measure the quality of life 3 months after surgery., 3 months after surgery|Life quality score (6 months after surgery), Use a modified Thyroid Cancer-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (THYCA-QOL) to measure the quality of life 6 months after surgery., 6 months after surgery|Life quality score (1 year after surgery), Use a modified Thyroid Cancer-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (THYCA-QOL) to measure the quality of life 1 year after surgery., 1 year after surgery
The number of dissected lymph nodes, Record the number of harvest and metastatic lymph nodes., 3 days after surgery|The volume of residual gland, Measure the volume of residual gland with ultrasound tests., 6 month after surgery|3-year recurrence rate, The rate will be calculated from the day of randomization to the present of evidence of recurrence., 3 years after surgery|Operation duration, Record the time from skin discission to incision close., Intraoperative|Hospital stays, Record the days from the day of surgery to the day of discharge., 3 days after surgery|Hospitalization expense, The total hospitalization expense., 3 days after surgery|Inflammatory response, Examine the white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophil count (NEU) and c-reactive protein (CRP) 1 day after surgery., 1 day after surgery
Subjects that suffering from papillary thyroid carcinoma will be randomized into Study Group (gasless transaxillary posterior endoscopic thyroidectomy ) or Control Group (conventional open thyroidectomy). Measure the outcomes as following, early complication rate, life quality score, the number of dissected lymph nodes, the volume of residual gland, 3-year recurrence rate, operation duration, hospital stays, hospitalization expense, and inflammatory and immune response.
