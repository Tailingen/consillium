Intrathecal Azacitidine and Nivolumab in Patients With Recurrent High-grade Glioma
This is a single-arm open-label phase 1 dose escalation/expansion trial assessing the safety and efficacy of concurrent intrathecal azacitidine and intrathecal nivolumab in recurrent high-grade glioma.
Glioblastoma (GBM)|Diffuse Midline Glioma (DMG)|Astrocytoma, IDH-Mutant, Grade 4|Diffuse Hemispheric Glioma, H3 G34-Mutant|Gliosarcoma of Brain
DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: Azacitidine (AZA)|PROCEDURE: lumbar puncture|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: MRI Contrast
Incidence of adverse events, Adverse events will be graded by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0., 24 months|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of intrathecal azacitidine in combination with intrathecal nivolumab, The MTD will be established using a 3+3 design., 24 months|Overall Response Rate (Expansion Cohort), The primary objective of the expansion cohort is to obtain a preliminary estimate of the overall response rate (ORR). ORR will be defined as the proportion of patients with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) 2.0 criteria, 24 months
To estiamte the duration of response (DOR), DOR will be defined as the time from first documented complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) to progressive disease (PD) according to RANO 2.0 criteria, 24 months|To estimate progression-free survival, PFS will be defined as the time from trial treatment initiation to first documented progression or death due to any cause., 24 months|To estimate overall survival, OS will be defined as the time from trial treatment initiation to death due to any cause., 24 months|To assess biomarkers for immunologic and epigenetic effects of therapy, Changes in CSF and blood immunological profiling by flow cytometry, cytokine/chemokine analysis. Changes in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis in CSF, 24 months
PRIMARY OUTCOME Phase I To determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of intrathecal (IT) azacitidine in combination with IT nivolumab in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma

Expansion Cohort To estimate the overall response rate (ORR)

SECONDARY OUTCOMES

To estimate:

1. Duration of response (DOR)
2. Progression-free survival (PFS)
3. Overall survival (OS)

EXPLORATORY OUTCOMES Changes in immune profiling (flow cytometry, cytokine/chemokine analysis) and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) biomarkers (quantification, DNA methylation)
