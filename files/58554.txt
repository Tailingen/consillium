Study Combining SAR245409 With Rituximab or Bendamustine Plus Rituximab in Patients With Indolent Lymphoma, Mantle Cell Lymphoma and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
Primary Objective:

- To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for SAR245409 when administered in combination with rituximab or bendamustine plus rituximab

Secondary Objectives:

* To determine the safety and tolerability of SAR245409 in combination with rituximab or bendamustine plus rituximab in subjects with indolent Hon-Hodgkin Lymphoma (iNHL) Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) or Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)
* To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of SAR245409, bendamustine and rituximab when used in combination in subjects with iNHL, MCL or CLL
* To determine the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of SAR245409 in combination with rituximab or bendamustine plus rituximab in subjects with iNHL, MCL or CLL
* To determine the antitumor activity of SAR245409 in combination with rituximab or bendamustine plus rituximab in subjects with iNHL, MCL or CLL

All subjects will take SAR245409 twice daily. All subjects will receive SAR245409 as long as there is clinical benefit.

Combination therapy with SAR245409, bendamustine and rituximab , will be administered over a 28 day cycle for up to 6 to 8 cycles.

Subjects receiving the doublet combination , SAR245409 plus rituximab will receive weekly rituximab for 4 - 8 weeks. Monthly Rituximab may be continued beyond 8 weeks.
