Pancreatic Cancer Molecular Sub-classification Using Endoscopic Ultrasound Tissue Core Biopsy Samples
This study evaluated the feasibility and reliability of PDAC molecular subtyping on tissue core biopsies samples acquired under EUS guidance. Moreover, this study will assess the impact of molecular subtypes assessed on EUS-FNB samples in patients with resectable and unresectable (locally advanced, advanced, and metastatic) PDAC undergoing chemotherapy on treatment response and survival and the utility in monitoring disease response to therapy and early occurrence of disease relapse using the TaqMan RNA assay in serum
Pancreas Cancer
Feasibility of PDAC molecular subtyping on biopsy samples, Number of patients in whom molecular subtyping on biopsy samples is obtained, At 6 months|Reliability of PDAC molecular subtyping on biopsy samples, concordance between molecular subtyping on biopsy samples and surgery specimens, At 1 year
Progression-free-survival (PFS), To assess the impact of molecular subtypes assessed on EUS-FNB samples PFS defined as the time from the date of trial entry until disease progression or relapse., From date of enrollment assessed until death or up to 3 years|Overall survival, Overall survival defined as the length of time (in days) between the treatment date and the date of death., From date of enrollment assessed until death or up to 3 years
PDAC patients are categorised as resectable, borderline resectable, locally advanced, metastatic and recurrent. Substantial neoplastic tissue is only available for the resectable group. This is unfortunate as the other groups are those that would benefit the most from molecular characterization and identification of markers, which may be predictive and/or provide therapeutic stratification. For these categories of patients, only fine needle aspiration or small biopsies could be obtained until now. However, the introduction of new needles, specifically designed to acquire larger high quality biopsy samples under endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), has now made it possible to test prognostic, predictive and therapeutic stratification markers. However, the applicability of EUS-fine needle biopsy (EUS-FNB) samples for this purpose has yet to be clinically validated. The working hypothesis of this proposal is that the molecular sub-classification of PDAC on EUS-FNB tissue samples could be applied for prognostic stratification and therapeutic decision strategies in both resectable and unresectable patients using DNA and RNA biomarkers.
