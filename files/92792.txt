Patient-tailored Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) for Colorectal Peritoneal Metastases (OrganoHIPEC)
The objective of this clinical trial is to demonstrate that cytoreductive surgery and patient-tailored hyperthermic intra-peritoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) will increase efficacy in controlling peritoneal disease. Tridimensional cell cultures (organoids) derived from colorectal cancer peritoneal metastases are used to select the most active drugs in an in vitro HIPEC model on individual-patient level, based on the hypothesis that resistance to drug(s) routinely used for intraperitoneal delivery can explain peritoneal relapse after combined treatment, depending on the individual tumor biology;
Peritoneal Metastases From Colorectal Cancer
PROCEDURE: Patient-tailored hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC)
One-year peritoneal metastasis-free survival, Proportion of patients who remain free of peritoneal metastasis at a time interval of one year from the date of the combined procedure of cytoreductive surgery and patient-tailored hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC), 12 months
Feasibility of patient-tailored hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC), Feasibility will be determined as the number of patients who have cytoreductive surgery and patient-tailored hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) among the total number of patients selected to be included in the study who sign the informed consent form, 48 months|Overall survival, Overall survival will be measured from the date of cytoreductive surgery and patient-tailored hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) to the date of death for any cause or, for patients still alive at the date of the last available follow-up, 60 months|Disease-free survival, Disease-free survival will be measured from the date of cytoreductive surgery and patient-tailored hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) to the date of peritoneal metastasis diagnosis, systemic metastases or death., 60 months|Safety of cytoreductive surgery and patient-tailored hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC), Proportion of patients who will suffer from postoperative complications after cytoreductive surgery and patient-tailored hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC), 48 months
This single-arm, single-center, open-label trial enrolls patients with limited and surgically resectable peritoneal metastases from colorectal cancer, no distant metastases, and no contraindication to major surgery. After signature of informed consent, patients undergo a preliminary laparoscopy to confirm diagnosis of peritoneal metastases, stage the disease, and obtain representative samples of peritoneal metastases. The investigators will use patient-derived organoids to select tailored hyperthermic intra-peritoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) regimens in an in vitro model HIPEC. A set of candidate drugs suitable for intraperitoneal administration are tested on tumor-derived organoids under the same conditions as in the clinical practice (same drug combinations, concentration, exposure time, temperature). Different concentrations are tested to generate reproducible dose-response curves. Patients receive 3-6 month preoperative systemic chemotherapy with targeted agents, according to current guidelines. Those not experiencing disease progression during preoperative systemic chemotherapy will have cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC with drugs selected on the organoid-based preclinical model. Patients will undergo postoperative follow-up.
