Study of the Safety and Contraceptive Efficacy of Relugolix Combination Therapy in Women With Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis Who Are at Risk for Pregnancy
The purpose of this study is to assess the contraceptive efficacy of relugolix combination therapy.
Contraception
DRUG: Relugolix Combination Therapy
Contraceptive Efficacy of Relugolix Combination Therapy as Assessed by the At-Risk Pearl Index (PI), The At-Risk PI is defined as the number of on treatment pregnancies per 100 women-years of treatment. The At-Risk PI will be calculated on the basis of cycles considered at-risk of pregnancy, that is, consecutive 28-day periods without use of any other contraceptive methods and with affirmed occurrence of vaginal intercourse. On-treatment pregnancies are pregnancies with an estimated conception date between the first day of study intervention intake up to and including 7 days after the last intake of study medication., 13 consecutive 28-day treatment cycles
Contraceptive Efficacy of Relugolix Combination Therapy as Assessed by the Modified At-Risk PI, The Modified At-Risk PI is based on the number of on-treatment pregnancies occurring during cycles without any other contraceptive methods, regardless of occurrence of vaginal intercourse. On-treatment pregnancies are pregnancies with an estimated conception date between the first day of study intervention intake up to and including 7 days after the last intake of study medication., 13 consecutive 28-day treatment cycles|Contraceptive Efficacy of Relugolix Combination Therapy as Assessed by the Gross PI, The "typical use" contraceptive efficacy will be assessed using the Gross PI, based on the number of on-treatment pregnancies occurring during all cycles regardless of the use of other contraceptive methods, confirmed vaginal intercourse, or protocol compliance. On-treatment pregnancies are pregnancies with an estimated conception date between the first day of study intervention intake up to and including 7 days after the last intake of study medication., 13 consecutive 28-day treatment cycles|Contraceptive Efficacy of Relugolix Combination Therapy as Assessed by the Method Failure PI, The "perfect use" contraceptive efficacy will be assessed using the Method Failure PI, based on the number of on-treatment pregnancies occurring during cycles that are at risk and without major protocol deviations. On-treatment pregnancies are pregnancies with an estimated conception date between the first day of study intervention intake up to and including 7 days after the last intake of study medication., 13 consecutive 28-day treatment cycles|Contraceptive Efficacy of Relugolix Combination Therapy as Assessed by the Cumulative 1-Year Pregnancy Rates, 13 consecutive 28-day treatment cycles|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, 54 Weeks|Number of Participants Who Do Not Complete 13 Treatment Cycles, 13 consecutive 28-day treatment cycles|Percent Change in Bone Mineral Density from Baseline to 6 and 12 Months On-Treatment, The percent change in bone mineral density will be measured from baseline to 6- and 12-months on treatment at the lumbar spine (L1-L4), total hip, and femoral neck., 12 Months On-Treatment or EOT|Percent Change in Bone Mineral Density from Baseline an 12 Months On-Treatment (or EOT) to 6 and 12 Months Post-Treatment, The percent change in bone mineral density will be measured from baseline and 12-months on-treatment (or End-of-Treatment) to 6- and 12-months post-treatment at the lumbar spine (L1-L4), total hip, and femoral neck., 12 Months Post-Treatment Follow-Up
This is a single-arm, open-label, phase 3 study to assess the contraceptive efficacy of relugolix combination therapy (relugolix 40 milligrams \[mg\], estradiol \[E2\] 1 mg, and norethindrone acetate \[NETA\] 0.5 mg).
