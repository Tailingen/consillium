Because of this severe limitation, nearly 50% of patients treated with BCG fail therapy and will a) require additional intravesical therapy or b) require cystectomy. A urine-based diagnostic that possesses the potential to accurately identify patients who will respond favorably to intravesical BCG is desperately needed.
