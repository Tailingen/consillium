A Study to Evaluate the Effect of Cyclosporine, a P-Glycoprotein, Breast Cancer Resistance Protein, and Organic-Anion-Transporting Polypeptide Inhibitor, on Pimodivir in Healthy Adults
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of a single oral dose of cyclosporine on the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of pimodivir when coadministered to healthy adult participants under fasted conditions.
Healthy
DRUG: Pimodivir|DRUG: Cyclosporine
Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Cmax is defined as maximum observed plasma concentration., Predose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 , 8, 12, 16, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168 hours postdose on Day 8|Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve From Time Zero to Last Quantifiable Concentration Time (AUC [0-Last]), AUC(0-Last) is area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to time of the last measurable (non-below quantification limit) concentration, calculated by linear-linear trapezoidal summation., Predose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 , 8, 12, 16, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168 hours postdose on Day 8|Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve From Time Zero to Infinite Time (AUC [0-infinity]), AUC (0-infinity) is the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinite time, calculated as the sum of AUC(last) and C(last)/lambda(z); where C(last) is the last observed measurable (non-below quantification limit) concentration., Predose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 , 8, 12, 16, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168 hours postdose on Day 8
Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a medicinal (investigational or non investigational) product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment., Approximately 65 days
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of a single oral dose of cyclosporine on the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of pimodivir when coadministered to healthy adult participants under fasted conditions.
