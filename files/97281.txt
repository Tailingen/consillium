Single Dose of Intravenous rhTNF-α and Liposomal Doxorubicin in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors or Lymphomas
Assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-α (rhTNF-α) when given as a single dose intravenously and in combination with liposomal doxorubicin in human subjects
Solid Tumors|Lymphomas
DRUG: Recombinant human TNF-α|DRUG: Liposomal doxorubicin|DRUG: Caelyx|DRUG: Recombinant human TNF-α
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of a single dose of intravenous recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-α plus liposomal doxorubicin, MTD is the dose level below the one that produces 2 or more Dose-Limiting Toxicities, Up to 22 days|Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) of a single dose of intravenous recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-α plus liposomal doxorubicin, Toxicity Criteria will be those listed in NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.

Any grade 3 cytokine release syndrome/acute infusion reaction or allergic and toxicity Grade 3 and above will be considered a DLT except:

* Grade 3 toxicities that recover to grade 1 or less within 48 hours after standard supportive treatment.
* Grade 4 neutropenia that recovers within 14 days.
* Grade 4 thrombocytopenia that recovers within 14 days.
* Grade 4 anemia that recovers within 14 days., up to 22 days
Overall tumor response using the international criteria proposed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1), 4 weeks|Caelyx/doxorubicin plasma levels, Caelyx/doxorubicin plasma levels will be measured at 0, 24, 48 and 192 hours post-dose by fluorimetry (excitation at 470nm, emission 590 nm) after liposomes have been disrupted in 70% ethanol, 0.3 N HCl, 0, 24, 48 and 192 hours post-dose
