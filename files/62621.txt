Radiation Therapy in Treating Older Women Who Are Undergoing Surgery for Stage I or Stage II Breast Cancer
RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x rays to kill tumor cells. Giving radiation therapy after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well radiation therapy works in treating older women who are undergoing surgery for stage I or stage II breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: adjuvant therapy|PROCEDURE: conventional surgery|RADIATION: radiation therapy
Reproducibility, 1 month
Impact of localized and concentrated radiotherapy on Katz's Activity of Daily Living score and Lawton's Instrumental Activity of Daily Living score, 3 weeks|Relapse-free survival, 1 year|Overall and specific survival, 1 year|Cosmetic result, 1 year|Direct and indirect costs, 1 month
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine reproducibility of localized and concentrated adjuvant radiotherapy, in terms of isodose curve and dose heterogeneity, in older women with stage I or II breast cancer.

Secondary

* Determine the impact of this regimen on Katz's Activity of Daily Living score and Lawton's Instrumental Activity of Daily Living score in these patients.
* Determine relapse-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine overall and specific survival of patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the cosmetic result, as assessed by the patient, surgeon, and radiologist, of this regimen in these patients.
* Determine the direct and indirect costs of this regimen in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open-label, nonrandomized study.

Patients undergo surgery. After surgery, patients undergo radiotherapy twice daily for 5 days.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 42 patients will be accrued for this study.
