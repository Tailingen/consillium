A Study of PRT2527 as Monotherapy and in Combination With Zanubrutinib or Venetoclax in Participants With R/R Hematologic Malignancies
This is a Phase 1 dose-escalation study of PRT2527, a potent and highly selective cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 9 inhibitor, in participants with select relapsed or refractory (R/R) hematologic malignancies. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, recommended phase 2 dose (PR2D), and preliminary efficacy of PRT2527 as a monotherapy and in combination with zanubrutinib or venetoclax.

This is an open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation, Phase 1 study of PRT2527, a CDK9 inhibitor, as monotherapy for participants with relapsed and refractory lymphoid and myeloid malignancies, in combination with zanubrutinib, a Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi) for participants with lymphoid malignancies, or in combination with venetoclax, a B-cell lymphoma 2 inhibitor (BCL-2i) in participants with myeloid malignancies. The study will be conducted in two parts, the dose escalation phase and the dose confirmation phase for both monotherapy and combination therapy. The dose escalation phase will evaluate escalating doses of PRT2527 as a monotherapy and in combination with zanubrutinib or venetoclax until MTD is identified or when the RP2D is determined. The dose confirmation phase will evaluate indication-specific cohorts at the RP2D to confirm the dose.

Approximately 274 participants will be enrolled in the dose escalation and indication-specific, dose confirmation cohorts.
