RW Effectiveness of Lurbinectedin in Extensive Stage SCLC
LURBICLIN cohort will describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients who received at least one dose of lurbinectedin as part of ATU program. LURBICLIN will evaluate effectiveness and safety of lurbinectedin in real-world conditions.

Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the first dose of treatment with lurbinectedin to death from any cause, 8 months|Real-world progression-free survival, time from first dose of treatment with lurbinectedin to first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause during the study, 8 months|Best response, best response recorded from the start of treatment with lurbinectedin until disease progression or start of further anti-cancer treatment, 8 months|Duration of treatment, time from first dose of treatment to discontinuation of treatment (interruption of more than 2 months) with lurbinectedin, 8 months|Pattern of tumor progression, site of disease progression after treatment with lurbinectedin, 8 months|Duration of treatment with lurbinectedin beyond progression, time between first occurrence of disease progression and treatment discontinuation, 8 months|Adverse Drug Reaction, maximal grade 3-4-5 treatment-related adverse events (SAEs, TRAEs), and immune-related events will be recorded for each patient, 8 months
LURBICLIN cohort will describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients who received at least one dose of lurbinectedin as part of ATU program. LURBICLIN will evaluate overall survival, real world progression-free survival, best response and duration of treatment in patients with advanced, metastatic Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) who received lurbinectedin as part of the French Early Access Program (ATU). Previous and subsequent treatments (treatment delivered immediately after treatment with lurbinectedin) will be recorded. Those outcomes will be correlated to clinical, pathological, and radiological characteristics of patients.
