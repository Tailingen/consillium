Intranasal Dexmedetomidine Premedication
Most patients with preoperative varying degrees of stress, anxiety, which makes the stress response in patients and affect the normal conduct of anesthesia and surgery.The sympathetic system hyperexcitability prone to cause adverse cardiovascular events and affect postoperative recovery. However, phenobarbital, as the traditional premedication, has less sedative, weak anxiolytic and other shortcomings. Midazolam accompanied by inhibition of respiration,excessive sedation, easily induced delirium,prolonged recovery time and so on. Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective α2-adrenergic receptor agonist, it has sedative, anxiolytic, no inhibition of respiration, and also colorless, odorless, non-mucosal stimulation, nasal drip ease of administration, patient acceptance, comfortable. Therefore, dexmedetomidine as premedication has certain advantages. The purpose of this research is to study sedative effect, safety and the impact of anesthesia recovery period of intranasal dexmedetomidine premedication for suspension laryngoscopy.
