This is an open-label, randomized, controlled phase II study evaluating induction immuno-chemotherapy and concurrent chemoradiotherapy with or without apatinib in unresectable, locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. In this study, patients are 1:1 randomized to either the study group or the control group. Patients in the study group will receive apatinib during induction immuno-chemotherapy and concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Patients in the control group will receive induction immuno-chemotherapy and concurrent chemoradiotherapy alone.
