A Clinical Trial of TQB3909 Tablets Combined With TQB3702 Tablets in Patients With Hematologic Malignancy
This is an open, multi-cohort clinical study. The first phase is a dose escalation study and the second phase is a dose expansion study based on the Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) / Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) obtained in the first phase. The purpose is to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of TQB3909 tablets combined with TQB3702 tablets in hematologic malignancy subjects.
