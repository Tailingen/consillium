Development of a New Immunochemistry Method Using Antibodies of Proteins Related Pancreatic Cancer
Identifying the malignancy of pancreatic mass using endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is important for treatment decision-making and prognosis prediction. The sensitivity of EUS-FNA cytology specimens based on Papanicolaou (Pap) staining is low, which hampers accurate diagnosis of pancreatic mass. We assessed the diagnostic value of immunohistochemical (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF) staining for methionyl-tRNA synthetase 1 (MARS1).
Pancreatic Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Cytology staining
The comparison of sensitivity between conventional staining method and new staining method, The sensitivity of new staining method will be compared with the conventional Pap staining of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology, 1 year
The evaluation of correlation index of staining at three type slides, The correlation index of the new staining method will be evaluated at three type slides such as Thinprep, Surepath, and Direct smear., 1 year
BACKGROUND / AIMS: The sensitivity of endoscopic ultrasound-guided aspiration cytology used to distinguish the pancreatic mass is low and clinical usefulness is not secured. The aim of this study was to evaluate clinical efficacy of a new differential staining method for cytology which is difficult to differentiate by the conventional staining method using pancreatic cancer related protein expressed only in pancreatic cancer.

Hypothesis: The statistical significance between conventional staining method and MARS1 staining in the pancreatic cancer cells collected by endoscopic ultrasound-guided aspiration will be compared to prove the usefulness of the new staining method.

Clinical study design: The expression of MARS1 in the pancreatic cancer cell line obtained by endoscopic ultrasound in patients suspected of having pancreatic cancer using Immunofluorescence or immunohistochemistry staining will be performed to differentiate the presence of the tumor. The sensitivity and specificity of the new staining method will be compared with the conventional staining method and its usefulness be confirmed.
