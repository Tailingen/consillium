Hemostatic Procedure After Biopsy of the Cervix
Cytological abnormalities of the Cervix uteri need to be clarified by colposcopy biopsy. To avoid bleeding after biopsy, monsel´s paste is a common used Agent. In a randomized clinical Trial the use of monsel´s paste after biopsy will be compared to no Intervention. The Primary outcome of the study is blood loss, secondary outcomes are pain, satisfaction of the patient and influence of Independent factors such as Age and Body mass index.
Uterine Cervical Dysplasia
PROCEDURE: Monsel´s Paste|OTHER: Wait and see
Blood loss after 15 minutes (5-step visual analogue scale), blood loss 15 minutes after biopsy will be measured judging the amount of blood on the sanitary napkin (5-step visual analogue scale), 15 minutes
Blood loss after 3 hours (5-step visual analogue scale), blood loss 3 hours after biopsy will be measured judging the amount of blood on the sanitary napkin (5-step visual analogue scale), 3 hours|Blood loss after 6 hours (5-step visual analogue scale), blood loss 6 hours after biopsy will be measured judging the amount of blood on the sanitary napkin (5-step visual analogue scale), 6 hours|Blood loss after 24 hours (5-step visual analogue scale), blood loss 24 hours after biopsy will be measured judging the amount of blood on the sanitary napkin (5-step visual analogue scale), 24 hours|Sensation of pain after 15 minutes (10-step visual analogue scale), patients will score their pain Level using a 10-step visual analogue scale (VAS) 15 minutes after biopsy, 15 minutes|Overall Sensation of pain after 24 hours (10-step visual analogue scale), patients will score their pain Level using a 10-step visual analogue scale (VAS) 24 hours after biopsy, 24 hours|Overall Satisfaction of the Patient after 24 hours (10-step visual analogue scale), patients will score their satisfaction Level using a 10-step visual analogue scale (VAS), 24 hours
