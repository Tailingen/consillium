Phase II Study of Preoperative FOLFIRINOX Versus Gemcitabine/Nab-Paclitaxel in Patients With Resectable Pancreatic Cancer
This research study is a Phase II clinical trial, which evaluates a combination of drugs, FOLFIRINOX and Gemcitabine/Nab-Paclitaxel, in the management of participants with resectable pancreatic cancer prior to surgery.
Resectable Pancreatic Cancer|Pancreatic Ductal Carcinoma
DRUG: FOLFIRINOX|DRUG: Gemcitabine/nab-Paclitaxel|RADIATION: Radiation therapy|DRUG: Capecitabine
Survival Rate at 18 Month, Number of participants surviving after 18 months of study follow-up, 18 Month
Pathologic Complete Response Rate (pCR)., Number of patients achieving pathologic complete response at 18 months. Pathologic complete response is defined as the absence of residual invasive disease in the panaceas and in the regional lymph nodes., 18 Months|Overall Survival Rate, Overall survival rate at five years using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, Baseline, 5 Years|Number of Participants With Serious and Non-Serious Adverse Events, Number of Participants with Serious and Non-Serious Adverse Events from baseline to 28 days, Baseline, 28 Days|Surgical Morbidity Rate, Number of patients experiencing a specific surgery related morbidity, within 30 days of surgery|30-day Post-operative Mortality Rate, Number of patients who died following surgery., 30 Days|Correlation of Biomarkers With PFS, Analysis of the correlation between selected bio-markers and progression free survival., 2 Years|Rate of Pathologic Downstaging, The number of participants achieving a reduction in the pathological staging of the primary cancer., 2 Years|Local Control Rate, The number of participants achieving local control. The local control rate is defined as the number of participants achieving stable disease, partial response, or a complete response., 2 Years
Patients who fulfill eligibility criteria will be randomized to Arm A or Arm B

* Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis.
* Upon registration participants will be randomized to Arm A (FOLFIRINOX) or Arm B (Gemcitabine/nab-Paclitaxel).
* After completion of FOLFIRINOX or Gemcitabine/Nab-paclitaxel, all participants without progressive disease will proceed to radiation therapy with capecitabine .
* Between 2 and 4 weeks after radiation is complete, participants will proceed for surgical resection of pancreatic cancer
