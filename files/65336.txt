Expanded Access to Nivolumab (Opdivo)
At BMS, we work with physicians/investigators to make investigational products available to patients with life-threatening diseases that have exhausted other treatment options and where there is a reasonable expectation of benefit over risk.

When contacted by a treating physician, BMS will consider requests for providing early patient access to Nivolumab in pediatric patients exhibiting a high mutational load.
