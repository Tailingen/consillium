Simultaneous Gemcitabine and Irreversible Electroporation for Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
The aim of this study was to compare the therapeutic efficacy between simultaneous gemcitabine administration and IRE and IRE alone for locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC)
Pancreatic Cancer
PROCEDURE: simultaneous gemcitabine and irreversible electroporation|PROCEDURE: irreversible electroporation
Safety (number of adverse effects), Adverse events, 3 month
Tumor response, Imaging evaluation, 12 months|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) was defined using time of death., 36 months|Carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) levels were measured., 1 month|Technical success of ablation, The technical success addressed whether the tumor was treated according to protocol and was covered completely by the ablation zone., 3 months
in the GEM- IRE group, before the IRE ablation started, patients received 1000 mg/m2 gemcitabine hydrochloride \[Qilu pharmaceutical (Hainan) Co., Ltd. Haikou, China\] intravenously (over approximately 30 min).

In the IRE group, the IRE ablation was performed without gemcitabine intravenous infusion before IRE.

The aim of this study was to evslusted the overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR) and adverse events after simultaneous therapy.
