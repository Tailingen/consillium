Effectiveness and Safety of Zilucoplan Treatment for French Patients with Myasthenia Gravis Over 3 Months
This study called "Multicenter Retrospective Study on the Short- and Medium-Term Efficacy and Tolerance of Zilucoplan Therapy in a Cohort of French Patients with Anti-AChR Myasthenia Gravis", is investigating the effects of a new treatment called Zilucoplan (generic name: ZILBRYSQ) on patients in France with a condition known as myasthenia gravis. Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease that causes muscle weakness that worsens throughout the day with activity and impacts the ability to work and perform daily activities. The study aims to see if Zilucoplan can improve muscle strength and quality of life over three months, while also assessing its tolerance and safety by monitoring side effects. Researchers hope this treatment will offer significant benefits for people with this challenging condition.
