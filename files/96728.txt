Camrelizumab Combined With Apatinib ,Carboplatin and Etoposide in Participants With ES-SCLC
This single-arm, Phase II, multicenter study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Camrelizumab (anti-programmed death-receptor 1 \[PD-1\] antibody) in combination with Apatinib+carboplatin plus (+) etoposide in chemotherapy-naive participants with ES-SCLC. Participants will be receive camrelizumab +apatinib+ carboplatin + etoposide on 21-day cycles for four -six cycles in the induction phase followed by maintenance with camrelizuab +apatinib until progressive disease (PD) as assessed by the investigator using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). Treatment can be continued until persistent radiographic PD or symptomatic deterioration.

Progression-Free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by the Investigator Using RECIST v1.1, Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as at least 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions compared to baseline, or unequivocal progression in non-target lesion(s), or the appearance of new lesion(s)., Baseline until PD or death, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 13 months)
Overall survival (OS), Baseline until death from any cause, up to approximately 20 months|Overall response rate (ORR), Percentage of Participants Achieving Complete Response (CR) and Partial Response (PR) ., up to 12 months|Disease control rate (DCR), Percentage of Participants Achieving Complete Response (CR) and Partial Response (PR) and Stable Disease (SD)., up to 12 months|Duration of response（DOR）, For participants who demonstrate CR or PR, DOR is defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, up to 12 months|PFS rate of 6 months progression-free survival, PFS rate of progression-free survival at 6 months: the percentage of subjects who did not develop disease progression or die of any cause at 6 months after beganing., up to 6 months
