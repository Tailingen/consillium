Effects of Chemotherapy on the Concentration of Minerals in Hair
The purpose of the investigator's graduate student research study is to investigate if there are significant changes in hair mineral levels in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.
Cancer
PROCEDURE: Hair cut
hair mineral levels(ug/g), Mineral levels such as calcium, magnesium, manganese, lead, iron, copper, cobalt, and chromium will be tested. All mineral levels are in ug/g., change between visit 1(baseline/start of chemotherapy) and visit 2 (about 2 months after visit 1)
Visit 1 - Before the start of chemotherapy

* Complete a questionnaire about demographics, health, and diet.
* Weight and height will be measured.
* A small sample of the participant's hair will be collected from the back side of the head near the base of the neck. Only the hair in the first inch closest to the scalp will be included in the sample. This hair sample will weigh 0.25g to 1g, which is about the same weight as one to two regular paper clips.
* The participant will be given a food frequency questionnaire

Visit 2- Approximately 2 months after start of chemotherapy

* The participant will complete a questionnaire about their health and diet.
* weight and height will be measured
* A small sample of the participant's hair will be collected from the back side of the head near the base of the neck. Only the hair in the first inch closest to the scalp will be included in the sample. This hair sample will weigh 0.25g to 1g, which is about the same weight as one to two regular paper clips.
