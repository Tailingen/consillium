Phase 2a Study to Evaluate Suppression of Methotrexate-induced Mucositis by TK112690
Patients will receive methotrexate at a dose of 45 mg/m2 administered weekly for 4 consecutive weeks as an iv infusion along with a nutritional supplement administered two hours before the methotrexate. One hour before the methotrexate treatment the patients will be administered the first infusion of the day of either TK112690 or placebo depending on randomization. Five hours after the methotrexate treatment the patients will be administered the second treatment of either TK112690 or placebo depending on randomization. The TK112690 dose will be 45 mg/kg.
Mucositis
DRUG: TK-112690|DRUG: Placebo TK-112690
Mucositis, Mucositis Evaluation Using Established Scoring Systems: NCI/CTCAE at 4 WKs (Primary) and WHO at 4 WKs (Primary).

NCI/CTCAE=National Cancer Institute/Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events and WHO=World Health Organization

NCI Grades- 0= No mucositis, 1=Mild mucositis (Painless ulcers, erythema, or mild soreness in the absence of lesions), 2=Moderate mucositis (Painful erythema, edema, or ulcers but eating or swallowing possible), 3= Severe mucositis (Painful erythema, edema, or ulcers requiring IV hydration), 4=Life threatening, 5=Death WHO Grades- 0=No mucositis, 1= Mild (Oral soreness, erythema), 2=Moderate (Oral erythema, ulcers, solid diet tolerated), 3=Severe (Oral ulcers, liquid diet only), 4=Life-threatening (Oral alimentation impossible).

For both the scales above, a higher score implies greater mucositis.

Scale specific mean values for patients in each group (placebo or treated) are calculated and compared by Student's t-test., up to 4 Weeks
Incidence Adverse Events That Are Related to Treatment, Tolerance, Measured Weekly Over 4 Weeks of Study
Patients will receive methotrexate at a dose of 45 mg/m2 administered weekly for 4 consecutive weeks as an iv infusion along with a nutritional supplement administered two hours before the methotrexate. One hour before the methotrexate treatment the patients will be administered the first infusion of the day of either TK112690 or placebo depending on randomization infusion. Five hours after the methotrexate treatment the patients will be administered the second treatment of either TK112690 or placebo depending on randomization. The TK112690 dose will be 45 mg/kg.

* A total of 22 patients will be enrolled into one of 2 different dose groups: TK-112690 treated or placebo treated.
* Screening must be within 15 days of subject enrollment.
* Patients will remain for observation at the clinical site for a minimum of 25 hours post initial TK112690 or placebo dose.
* Study follow-up will occur on Week 6, two weeks after the last dosing of methotrexate.
* Blinding: The study will be partially blinded. The patient and investigator will be blinded as to whether TK112690 or placebo is administered. The CRO, sponsor, and site pharmacist will know whether the patient was administered active drug or placebo.
