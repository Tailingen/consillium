Evaluation of the Patient's Experience in Medical Studies for Cholangiocarcinoma
The main reason for conducting this research is to gain a better understanding of why some people with cholangiocarcinoma are not able to participate in or complete clinical trials. Historically, certain groups of people have been more likely to participate in clinical trials, but there hasn't been much research to understand why this is the case.

The goal is to find out which aspects of a clinical trial may make it more difficult for patients to take part or see it through. The data will be evaluated through different demographic lenses and identify trends that could help improve the experience of future cholangiocarcinoma patients during clinical trials.
