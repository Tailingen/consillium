Biomarkers in Tissue Samples From Young Patients With Liver Cancer
This research trial is studying biomarkers in tissue samples from young patients with liver cancer. Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

Biomarkers associated with hepatoblastoma subtypes and cancer stages, Baseline
Genes involved in embryonic development and/or stem cell signaling pathways for which preliminary data suggests involvement in the pathogenesis of hepatoblastoma, Baseline|Exome sequencing, Baseline
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To identify biomarker signatures associated with hepatoblastoma subtypes (by microRNA array profiling), and their potential correlation with liver developmental stages as well as outcome.

II. To correlate expression array data with copy number array data.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To carry out a focused sequencing interrogation of amplified or deleted genomic regions as well as genes in key cell pathways involved in embryonic development and/or stem cell signaling pathways for which preliminary data suggests involvement in the pathogenesis of hepatoblastoma.

II. To perform whole exome sequencing in a subset of tumors.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Archived tumor tissue samples are analyzed for hepatoblastoma and other liver tumor biomarkers by microRNA array profiling and exome sequencing. Results are then compared with patients' clinical data.
