A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Tolerability of SX-682 in Combination With Nivolumab as a Maintenance Therapy in Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma
The main purpose of this research study is to determine the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) of SX-682 in combination with nivolumab in patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma who have completed at least 16 weeks of first line chemotherapy treatment without evidence of disease progression.
Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma|Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: SX-682|DRUG: Nivolumab Injectable Product
Maximum tolerable dose [Safety and Tolerability], Maximum tolerable dose is defined by less than or equal to 30% dose limiting toxicity (DLT) event rate within a given dose combination,, through study completion, an average of 6 months
Progression Free Survival, Measure of time from study enrollment until progression., From date of enrollment until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months|Overall Survival, Measure of time from study enrollment until death from any cause., From date of enrollment until date of death from any cause up to 24 months
In this study the investigator would like to better understand the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) of SX-682 in combination with nivolumab in patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma who have completed at least 16 weeks of first line chemotherapy treatment without evidence of disease progression. In addition, the investigator would like to measure the SX-682 pharmacokinetic data in humans. The investigator would also like to assess the immunophenotypic and stromal changes to the tumor microenvironment after treatment.
