PCI Treatment/Gemcitabine & Chemotherapy vs Chemotherapy Alone in Patients With Inoperable Extrahepatic Bile Duct Cancer
This study will assess the safety and effectiveness of fimaporfin-induced photochemical internalisation (PCI) of gemcitabine complemented by systemic gemcitabine/cisplatin chemotherapy compared to gemcitabine/cisplatin alone, in patients with inoperable cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the treatment groups and will receive study treatment for 6 months, followed by assessments every 3 months, as applicable.
Cholangiocarcinoma
DRUG: Fimaporfin and Gemcitabine|DRUG: Gemcitabine/Cisplatin chemotherapy
Progression-free Survival (PFS), From date of randomisation to date of objective disease progression or death, whichever comes first (in months), Up to 18 months
Overall Survival (OS), From date of randomisation to date of death from any cause (in months), Up to 24 months|Best Overall Response (BOR), Best response recorded from start of treatment until disease progression/recurrence (according to RECIST 1.1), Up to 18 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Proportion of patients with measurable disease at baseline who have at least one visit response with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) noted (according to RECIST 1.1), Up to 18 months|Duration of Response (DoR), From first documented tumour response until first documented disease progression, or death in the absence of disease progression (in months), Up to 24 months|Overall Disease Control Rate (DCR), Proportion of patients with BOR of CR, PR or stable disease (SD) (according to RECIST 1.1) at or after the first follow-up scan, partial response or complete response, 6 months and 12 months|Change in Tumor Size, Best overall percentage change in tumour size from baseline, Up to 18 months|Loco-regional Tumour-related Events and Biliary Complications, Frequency and severity of loco-regional tumour related events and biliary complications, Up to 12 months|Adverse Events (AEs)/Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Number and proportion of patients with AEs/SAEs, Up to 12 months|Area Under the Plasma Concentration Curve (AUC) Was Performed for Patients in Arm A., A non-compartmental analysis (NCA) was applied on the data. AUC from time zero to the last measured concentration (AUC 0-t) was initially estimated by the linear trapezoidal method., Time Frame AUC calculated from time zero to C5-D8 (3 months from the first PCI treatment)|Maximum Observed Concentration (Cmax) Was Performed for Patients in Arm A., A non-compartmental analysis (NCA) was applied on the data., Timepoints for pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling: Day -4 (before, 30m and 4hrs after Amphinex), C1-D1, C1-D8, C2-D8, C3-D8, C4-D8, C4-D18 (before, 30m and 4hrs after Amphinex), C5-D1, and C5-D8|Time to Cmax (Tmax) Was Performed for Patients in Arm A., A non-compartmental analysis (NCA) was applied on the data as described by Gabrielsson \& Weiner (Methods in molecular biology, 929:161-180, 2012)., Timepoints for PK sampling: Day -4 (before, 30 min and 4 hours after Amphinex), C1-D1, C1-D8, C2-D8, C3-D8, C4-D8, C4-D18 (before, 30 min and 4 hours after Amphinex) , C5-D1, and C5-D8|Health-related Quality of Life (QoL), QoL assessment. Patients select one of four answers to 22 questions ranging from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Lower total scores indicate a more favorable QoL perception than a higher score., Up to 18 months
Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is an uncommon adenocarcinoma arising from cells lining the bile ducts. Standard treatment options for CCA include surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, dependent upon if the CCA is intra- or extra-hepatic. Surgical removal of the tumor is the only potential cure, and CCA is very resistant to standard pharmaceutical drug treatment, though chemotherapy has some effect. Current chemotherapy uses cisplatin plus gemcitabine. Photochemical internalisation (PCI) is a novel technology, where photochemical reactions are used to enhance the effect of drugs by increasing their ability cross cell membranes to interact with their intended target. This study will assess the safety and effectiveness of fimaporfin-induced PCI of gemcitabine complemented by systemic gemcitabine/cisplatin chemotherapy compared to gemcitabine/cisplatin alone, in patients with inoperable CCA.
