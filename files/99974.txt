Neoadjuvant Pemetrexed, Carboplatin and Bevacizumab in Unresectable, Locally Advanced Lung Adenocarcinoma
The prognosis of patients with unresectable, locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is poor. Chemoradiotherapy is the main treatment modality for this disease. The newer drug regimens can be expected to improve survival in this subset of NSCLC patients. Modern targeted therapies have enhanced the outcomes of lung cancer treatment, especially for advanced NSCLC. Among the targeted approaches for the inhibition of angiogenesis is bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody that represses vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Bevacizumab in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy used as neoadjuvant chemotherapy may change the previous treatment modality. It allows some lung cancer patients to be downstaged to surgery rather than radiotherapy. Thus, survival of these patients may be improved.
