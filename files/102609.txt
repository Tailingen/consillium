A Study to Investigate the Regional Brain Kinetics of Brain Drug Transporters Using P-glycoprotein and Breast Cancer Resistance Protein Substrates and by Using the Positron Emission Tomography Ligand 11C-JNJ-63779586 in the Human Brain
The purpose of this study is to investigate the total body biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of 11C-JNJ-63779586 by Positron Emission Tomography (PET) in healthy young adult males (Part A); to estimate and compare the uptake, distribution, and clearance of 11C-JNJ-63779586 in the brain by PET between mild Alzheimer Disease (AD) participants (males/females) and age- and gender-matched control participants (Part B), corrected for regional cerebral blood flow differences; and to model the tissue specific kinetics of 11C-JNJ-63779586 in human brain with the appropriate input function (IF) (Part B).
Alzheimer Disease
DRUG: 11C-JNJ-63779586
Effective Radiation Dose Following Injection of 11C-JNJ-63779586 (Part A), Whole body and organ specific dosimetry for the tracer will be estimated using specific software for calculation of the absorbed radiation dose. Afterwards, dosimetry will be compared with other carbon-11 labeled radiotracers. According to these results, the same or lower dose might be used for Part B, to prevent high radiation doses to certain organs., Day 1|Total and Regional Brain Compartmental Kinetics for Volume of Distribution of 11C-JNJ-63779586 (Part B), Regional brain uptake will be determined using a Volume of interest (VOI) based analysis. Differences in regional brain uptake between Alzheimer Disease (AD) and control participants will be determined using statistical parametric mapping. Regional uptake of 11C-JNJ-63779586 into brain (K1) will be assessed and compared between participants with AD and control participants, corrected for regional blood flow., Day 1|Percent Intact Tracer of 11C-JNJ-63779586 in Blood Samples (Part B), Sequential arterial blood samples will be taken post tracer injection to model an arterial input function (IF) of the tracer and allow analysis of radio metabolites (percent intact tracer)., Day 1|Radiometabolite Fraction of 11C-JNJ-63779586 in Blood Samples (Part B), Sequential arterial blood samples will be taken post tracer injection to model an arterial input function (IF) of the tracer and allow analysis of radio metabolites (percent intact tracer)., Day 1
Number of Participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability (Part A and Part B), An adverse event is any untoward medical event that occurs in a participant administered an investigational product, and it does not necessarily indicate only events with clear causal relationship with the relevant investigational product., Up to 29 days (Part A) and Up to 105 days (Part B)
The purpose of this study is to investigate the total body biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of 11C-JNJ-63779586 by Positron Emission Tomography (PET) in healthy young adult males (Part A); to estimate and compare the uptake, distribution, and clearance of 11C-JNJ-63779586 in the brain by PET between mild Alzheimer Disease (AD) participants (males/females) and age- and gender-matched control participants (Part B), corrected for regional cerebral blood flow differences; and to model the tissue specific kinetics of 11C-JNJ-63779586 in human brain with the appropriate input function (IF) (Part B).
