PEComas: Natural History and Prognostic Factors
Perivascular epithelioid cell tumors are rare and characterized by the expression of myomelanocytic markers. They belong to a complex tumor family that includes angiomyolipomas, lymphangioleiomyomatosis and other soft-tissue tumors. Given their rarity, the natural history of pecomas is not yet understood, and a comprehensive classification that integrates clinical, pathological and molecular features has not been achieved as of today.

This study is a national multicenter retrospective study to better understand the natural history of PEComas, excluding lymphangioleiomyomatosis and classic triphasic angiomyolipomas.

The primary purpose is the identification of prognostic markers impacting the relapse. Secondaries purposes are to identify prognostic markers impacting the overall survival and to have a better understanding of natural history
PEComas
Study of the prognostic factors associated with the risk of relapse, The period from January 1st, 1990 to December 31, 2018 will be examined
