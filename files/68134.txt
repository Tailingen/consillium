Research on the Role of SLC1A5 in the Development of Esophageal Cancer
To explore the significance of Solute Carrier Family 1 Member 5 (SLC1A5) in the occurrence of esophageal cancer, by comparing the expression of SLC1A5 between esophageal cancer tissues and adjacent tissues.
Esophageal Cancer|Amino Acid Transport Disorder
OTHER: SLC1A5 expression
optical density (ODs) of each slice by immunohistochemistry assay, For immunohistochemistry assayï¼š Briefly, the samples will be cut into slices, which will be stained with standard steps. Finally, three high power fields will be randomly selected from each slice and the average optical density (OD) will be measured in each field., within one year (plus or minus 1 month) after surgery
SLC1A5 expression detected by WesternBlot, Western blot assay will be done by comparing the intensity of bands. To start with, xray film will be scanned on a flat-bed scanner. Then the grayscale image will be analyzed with software. Finally the Gray Value of each band will be obtained for analysis., within one year (plus or minus 1 month) after surgery
This will be an observational study. The investigators will aim to enroll 100 male and female adult patients (aged 18 years and over) of all ethnicities/races, who have been referred to the Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University for esophageal cancer.

The investigators will be using a standardized data collection form. This is an observational study in which standard of care will be practiced and the patients are not placed at additional risk from participating in this study. However, as the investigators are collecting data prospectively, all participants will sign consent. An attempt will be made to see if there is a correlation between the expression of SLC1A5 with esophageal cancer.
