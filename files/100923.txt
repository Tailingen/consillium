177Lu-EB-PSMA617 in Patients With Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer
This is an open-label, non-controlled, non-randomized study to assess the safety and measure image-based absorbed dose of 177Lu-EB-PSMA-617 in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who will undergo radioliagnd therapy using 177Lu-EB-PSMA-617. All patients underwent whole-body 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT for selection and accepted intravenous injection with single dose 0.80-1.1 GBq (21.5-30 mCi) of 177Lu-EB-PSMA-617 within one week, then monitored at 2, 24, 72, 120 and 168 h after 177Lu-EB-PSMA617 administration with serial whole body planar and SPECT/CT imaging.
Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer
DRUG: 177Lu-EB-PSMA-617
Standardized uptake value of 177Lu-EB-PSMA617 in normal organs and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer., The semiquantitative analysis will be performed by the same person for all the cases, and the standardized uptake value at each time point in normal organs and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer will be measured, 1 year
Adverse events collection, Adverse events within 2 months after the injection and scanning of patients will be followed and assessed, 2 months
Prostate cancer is the most frequent malignant tumor in men worldwide. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), is a surface molecule specifically expressed by prostate tumors which was shown to be a valid target for radiotherapy. 177Lu-PSMA-617, a urea-based compound, provide an effective target for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. However, a major problem in the therapeutic use of 177Lu-PSMA-617 has been its short half-life and fast rate of clearance. This study was designed to investigate the safety, dosimetry and preliminary effects of 177Lu-EB-PSMA-617 in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.
