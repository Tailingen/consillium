Utility of XCL1 as a Prognostic Marker in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
The purpose of the study is to determine the utility of XCL1 in the prognosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
Number of patients with poor prognosis and high levels of XCL1, Number of patients with high levels of XCL1, expression of its receptor and other cytokines., 3 months|Number of patients with poor prognosis and high levels of cytokines, Measurements obtained will be evaluated to assess the prognosis of patients and made correlations with the concentration of IL-1β, IL-2 and XCL1 as well as the relationship XCR1 XCL1 and in leukemic cells., 3 months
Each year approximately 256,000 children and adults around the world develop a form of leukemia, and 209,000 died from it. Recently, some studies have evaluated the relationship between the concentration of some cytokines and prognosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. XCL1 is a lymphotactin that belongs to a cytokine subfamily called C or γ with only one cysteine in the N-terminal residue. It has been found with significant expression of receptor mRNA XCL1 (XCR1) in T and B lymphocytes and related to hematological neoplasms. For these reasons, XCL1 could be a efficient marker of prognosis in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
