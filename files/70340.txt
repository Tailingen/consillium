An Observational Study for Gastric Cancer in Asymptomatic Carriers of High Risk Helicobacter Pylori
This study is intended to be a prospective observational cohort study. The incidence of gastric cancer and progression of gastric precancerous lesions will be compared between groups through prospective follow-up of a population of asymptomatic carriers harboring high-risk Hp SNP subtypes and non-high-risk subtypes.
Gastric (Stomach) Cancer|Helicobacter Infection
OTHER: observational study
Difference in incidence of gastric cancer (pathologically or imaging-confirmed gastric cancer) between high-risk and non-high-risk groups., From enrollment to the end of the study in 10 years
Primary study objective: to assess the difference in the incidence of gastric cancer between asymptomatic carriers of high-risk SNP subtypes of H. pylori and the non-high-risk population during the follow-up period.

Secondary research objectives: 1. To observe and compare the cumulative incidence and progression of gastric precancerous lesions (e.g., atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, etc.) in each population group during the follow-up period.2. To explore the interaction of high-risk SNPs on the risk of gastric cancer in the context of different age, gender or other risk factors (e.g. diet, smoking, alcohol abuse, family history, etc.).
