Efficacy of Chemotherapy, Associated to Either Cetuximab or Bevacizumab, in KRAS Wild-type Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Patients With Progressive Disease After Receiving First-line Treatment With Bevacizumab
The main objective is to evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) at 4 months.

The secondary objectives are to evaluate the objective response rate (OR) (= complete responses (CR) and partial responses (PR)) according to the RECIST v1.1 criteria, the progression-free survival (PFS), the overall survival (OS), the overall survival from the date of the first-line chemotherapy used on the metastatic disease, the treatment tolerance (NCI CTC AE V4 criteria, except for peripheral neurological toxicity (Lévi Scale)), the quality of life according to the EORTC QLQ-C30 criteria.

The objectives of the biological study are to evaluate potentially predictive anti-EGFR and anti-VEGF response factors and CEC rates as predictive biomarkers for the efficacy of bevacizumab associated with chemotherapy in mCRC treatment.

Progression-free survival (PFS) at 4 months, Progression-free survival is defined as the time from randomization to progression (RECIST v1.1 criteria) or death. Patients alive without progression will be censored at the last follow-up., 4 months
Objective response rate (OR), The objective response rate is defined as the occurence of a complete response \[CR\] or a partial responses \[PR\] according to RECIST V1.1 between date of randomization and date of end of treatment. It will be evaluated by the investigator with RECIST v1.1 criteria every 6 weeks up to disease progression., 12 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival is defined as the time from randomization to progression (RECIST v1.1 criteria) or death. Patients alive without progression will be censored at the last follow-up., 4 months|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization to death any cause or last follow-up (censored data)., until death or progression (24 months)|Overall survival from the date of the first-line chemotherapy used on the metastatic disease, Overall survival from the date of the first-line chemotherapy used on the metastatic disease is defined as the time from the first day of the first-line chemotherapy used on the metastatic disease to death any cause or last follow-up news (censored data)., until death or progression (24 months)|Treatment tolerance, Tolerance of the treatment will be based on toxicities of evaluated products by clinical and biological measurements (NCIC/CTC (CTCAE V4) criteria, except for peripheral neuropathy toxicity (Lévi scale))., Every 2 weeks, during the treatment.|Quality of life, Quality of life will be evaluated with the EORTC QLQ - C30., every 6 weeks
