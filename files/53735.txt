Investigation of the Safety and Tolerability of BSCT (Anti-nf-P2X7) 10% Ointment
This is a Phase 1, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study to assess the safety and tolerability of BSCT (anti-nf-P2X7) 10% Ointment in subjects with BCC.
Carcinoma, Basal Cell (BCC)
DRUG: Treatment with BSCT
Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (Safety and Tolerability), Adverse events and any changes in physical examinations will be monitored, as described in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 21 Part 312. In particular local cutaneous irritation including erythema, peeling, dryness, itching, and burning/ stinging that first occur during the study or represent a worsening from Baseline will be recorded as AEs., 8 weeks|Pharmacokinetics - Measure Serum Concentration of Total Sheep IgG Using an ELISA., To determine PK, blood levels of sheep IgG were measured in samples collected at Visit 2 (Baseline), Visit 5, predose at Visit 6 (EOT), and then at 1 h, 2 h, and 4 h after the last dose of study medication., 28 days|Pharmacokinetics - Measure Subject Antibody Response to the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient Using an Indirect Fluorescent Immuno Assay., The active ingredient of BSCT is sheep IgG which may causes an immunogenic response if it enters the systemic circulation. To monitor this response patient blood samples collected at Screening, Visit 2 (Baseline), Visit 6 (EOT), and at Visit 8 (EOS) was tested for anti-sheep IgG antibodies (indicative of immune response against API)., 8 weeks
The purpose of the trial was to determine the safety and tolerability of BSCT (anti-nf-P2X7) 10% Ointment topically applied twice daily for 28 consecutive days in male and female patients with BCC; and to determine the steady-state pharmacokinetics (PK) of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (total sheep Immunoglobulin G \[IgG\]) when BSCT (anti-nf-P2X7) 10% Ointment is applied twice daily to BCC lesions. This was an open-label, single-arm, multicenter Phase 1 study that enrolled 21 BCC patients.
