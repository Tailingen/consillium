Anti-CD19 U-CAR-T Cell Therapy for B Cell Hematologic Malignancies
The stunning response rate of anti-CD19(cluster of differentiation antigen 19) auto-CAR(chimeric antigen receptor)-T cell therapy brings hope to patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell hematologic malignancies. However, based on open clinical trials, using patients' T cells might encounter the failure of apheresis available T cells, even if successful, the time needed for the manufacture could also cause the irreversible disease progress. Furthermore, the cost of auto-CAR-T cells is not affordable for most patients. So to provide an accessible and affordable anti-CD19 CAR-T cell therapy for patients with B-cell hematologic malignancies, we launch such a trial that using the edited T cells from healthy donors to manufacture universal CAR-T cells and adapt it in patients with CD19+ B-cell leukemia or lymphoma.
