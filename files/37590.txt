Phase II Randomized Study on Locally Advanced NSCLC Escalated Dose on Individual Basis Treatment With Radiochemotherapy
The purpose of this study is to examine the valu of individually dose escalated radiotherapy compared with a standard dose of radiotherapy combined with standard concomitant chemotherapy for patients with locally advanced non small cell lung cancer (stage III) with good performance status.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer|Locally Advanced Disease
RADIATION: Standard radiochemotherapy to 68 Gy|RADIATION: Dose escalated radiochemotherapy up to 84 Gy
Progression free survival, 36 monts after randomization
Numbers of patients without progression of locoregional disease, Measured with CT-scan according to the RECIST criteria for response, 36 months after randomization
Overall survival, 36 months after randomization|Numbers of patients with adverse events, According to CTC version 4.0, Up to 36 months after randomization|Quality of life, Measured by questionaires, EORTC QLQ 30 + LC 14, Up to 36 months after randomization
This is an open label, multicentre phase II trial of individually escalated radiotherapy up to 84 Gy due to normal tissue dose constraints combined with standard concurrent chemotherapy (cisplatin-vinorelbine) compared to standard dose radiotherapy (68 Gy) combined with the same chemotherapy. There are restrictions due to lung function, performance status and pre-treatment weight loss. The main endpoint is progression free survival and additional endpoints are local control, overall survival, toxicity quality of life and relapse pattern.
