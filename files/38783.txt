DRP-104 (Glutamine Antagonist) in Combination With Durvalumab in Patients With Advanced Stage Fibrolamellar Carcinoma (FLC)
The purpose of this study is to determine whether the combination of subcutaneous DRP-104 in combination with intravenous Durvalumab is safe and yields a clinically compelling antitumor activity measured as based on objective response rate (ORR, assessed by RECIST 1.1). Secondary objectives include progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).
Fibrolamellar Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: Durvalumab|DRUG: DRP-104
Number of participants experiencing drug-related adverse events (AEs) requiring treatment discontinuation, When calculating the incidence of AEs, each AE (as defined by NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events \[CTCAE\] v5.0) will be counted only once for a given subject., 4 years|Objective response rate (ORR) using immune Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1), ORR is defined as the percentage of patients achieving a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) to DRP-104 (glutamine antagonist) in combination with duvalumab, based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) at any time during the study. CR = disappearance of all target lesions, PR is =\>30percent decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, progressive disease (PD) is \>20percent increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, stable disease (SD) is \<30percent decrease or \<20percent increase in sum of diameters of target lesions., 4 years
Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the number of months from the date of first treatment to disease progression (progressive disease \[PD\] or relapse from complete response \[CR\] as assessed using RECIST 1.1 criteria) or death due to any cause. Progression will be censored at the date of the last scan for subjects without documentation of disease progression at the time of analysis. Per RECIST 1.1 criteria, CR = disappearance of all target lesions, Partial Response (PR) is =\>30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, Progressive Disease (PD) is \>20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, Stable Disease (SD) is \<30% decrease or \<20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions. Estimation based on the Kaplan-Meier curve., 4 years|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the number of months from the first dose of study treatment to death from any cause or end of follow-up. OS will be censored on the date the subject was last known to be alive for subjects without documentation of death at the time of analysis. Estimation based on the Kaplan-Meier curve., 4 years
