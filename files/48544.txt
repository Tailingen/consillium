Phase IB Metformin, Digoxin, Simvastatin in Solid Tumors
This is a single-center trial in subjects with pancreatic cancer and other advanced solid tumors. It is an open-label, single arm dose escalation Phase IB trial with subjects accrued in a 3 subject dose escalation cohort. Subjects with treated advanced solid tumors, and showing disease progression on established standard therapy, will be enrolled in this trial.
