Lung Cancer ID (Identity) Study
The distribution of demographic, clinical, radiological, pathological and molecular characteristics of lung cancer at the time of diagnosis, as well as preferential association between elements of those domains, have not been specifically studied in Italy. The aim of the present project is to assess, in a systematic fashion, the demographic, clinical, radiological, pathological and molecular characteristics of advanced lung cancer at the time of diagnosis in a large Italian cohort of consecutive patients referred to two tertiary referral centers.
Lung Cancer Stage IV
OTHER: Advanced lung cancer patients' group
Distribution of histologic subtypes, The investigators will assess the prevalence of histologic subtypes in patients with advanced lung cancer, 24 months
Distribution of histologic subtypes according to clinical and radiological characteristics, The investigators will assess the prevalence of different histologic subtypes according to clinical and imaging characteristics, 24 months|Molecular profiling, Prevalence of individual molecular markers in patients with advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer histology, 24 months|Time to diagnosis, Time lag between onset of symptoms (if any) and invasive testing, 24 months
