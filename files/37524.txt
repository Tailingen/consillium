Combination Intraventricular Chemotherapy Pilot Study: 5-Azacytidine (5-AZA) and Trastuzumab Infusions Into the Fourth Ventricle or Resection Cavity in Children and Adults with Recurrent or Residual Posterior Fossa Ependymoma
The purpose of this study is to establish the safety and tolerability of simultaneous infusions of 5-Azacytidine and trastuzumab into the fourth ventricle of the brain or resection cavity in patients with recurrent posterior fossa ependymoma and to assess the antitumor activity of simultaneous infusions of 5-Azacytidine and trastuzumab into the fourth ventricle of the brain or resection cavity in patients based upon imaging studies and lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology.
Fossa Ependymoma
DRUG: 5-Azacytidine and trastuzumab infusion
Number of patients with new neurological deficits, A new neurological deficit will be defined as new cranial neuropathy, change in level of consciousness, motor weakness, gait change or cerebellar finding (ataxia, dysmetria, dysdiadochokinesis) that is attributed by treating physicians to infusions. New neurological deficits graded as Grade 3 or higher after infusions will be defined as serious adverse events (SAE's), 7 days after treatment
Change in disease progression as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Baseline(before start of treatment),end of treatment (7 days after treatment)|Change in disease progression as assessed by lumbar CSF cytology, Baseline(before start of treatment),end of treatment (7 days after treatment)
