ToGA Study - A Study of Herceptin (Trastuzumab) in Combination With Chemotherapy Compared With Chemotherapy Alone in Patients With HER2-Positive Advanced Gastric Cancer
This parallel, randomized, open-label, multi-centre study will evaluate the effect on overall survival of trastuzumab (Herceptin) in combination with a chemotherapy compared to the chemotherapy alone in patients with HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer. Trastuzumab (Herceptin) will be administered as intravenous infusion of 6 mg/kg (loading dose 8 mg/kg) every 3 weeks. The chemotherapy consists of a combination of 6 cycles of fluorouracil (800 mg/m2/day intravenous infusion every 3 weeks) and cisplatin (80 mg/m2 intravenous infusion every 3 weeks), or capecitabine (Xeloda, 1000 mg/m2 po twice daily for 14 days every 3 weeks) and cisplatin (80 mg/m2 intravenous infusion every 3 weeks). Treatment with trastuzumab (Herceptin) will continue until disease progression. The target sample size is 300-600 patients.

For TLs, SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR, nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as a reference the smallest SLD recorded since treatment had started. For NTLs, SD was defined as a persistence of one or more NTLs and/or maintenance of tumor marker levels above the normal limits., BL, Days 43, 85, and 127, and every 21 days thereafter until disease progression or the end of study, 1 year after the cut-off date for the 2nd interim efficacy analysis|European Organisation For the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (QLQ C-30) Questionnaire Scores, EORTC QLQ-C30: included functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), global health status, symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting) and single items (dyspnoea, appetite loss, insomnia, constipation/diarrhea and financial difficulties). Most questions used 4 point scale (1 'Not at all' to 4 'Very much'; 2 questions used 7-point scale (1 'very poor' to 7 'Excellent').
