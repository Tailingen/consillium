Efficacy Evaluation of Propranolol Treatment of Hepatic Hemangioma
Hepatic hemangioma is one of the most common benign tumor of the liver. Although the overall prognosis is good, active interventions are still needed in high-risk patients. Without specific drugs, the main treatment methods include surgical treatments, interventional therapies and radiotherapies. Effective medical treatments are needed urgently. Propranolol has achieved good results in infantile Facial/hepatic hemangioma, and shows some effectiveness in adult hemangioma. Here, investigators intend to evaluate the therapeutic effect of propranolol in adult hepatic hemangioma.

Tumor size, Evaluating maximum diameter obtained by contrast-enhanced CT scanning, 6 months after treatment
Objective response rate, Percentage of patients whose cancer shrinks or disappears after treatment, 6 months after treatment
Disease control rate, Percentage of patients whose cancer doesn't progress after treatment, 6 months after treatment|Vascular endothelial growth factor, Level of serum Vascular endothelial growth factor, 6 months after treatment|Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects, According to Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects version 4, 6 months after treatment
In view of the lack of medical treatment for hepatic hemangioma, investigators chose hemangioma patients with a diameter of 5-10 cm and no significant risk of rupture, or those with surgical indications but rejected of surgical, interventional/radiological interventions. After confirmation of no high risk for drugs, oral propranolol was given. The tumor size, objective remission rate, disease control rate, drugs related side effects and other endpoints events were recorded and analyzed, to assess the propranolol could or couldn't effectively control the progress of hepatic hemangioma.
