Microplastics in the Human Respiratory System
Environmental pollution from plastics has become a significant global issue, with microplastics-tiny particles resulting from plastic degradation-being increasingly detected in various environments, including aquatic ecosystems, soil, and air. These particles can enter the human body through ingestion or inhalation. Despite growing concerns, little is known about the prevalence and types of microplastics in human lungs. Some studies suggest that microplastics may negatively impact respiratory function and lead to lung diseases. Hypothetically, they could cause inflammation, metabolic disorders, and contribute to lung cancer development. However, research is still in its early stages, and conclusive evidence about the mechanisms linking microplastics to negative health effects is lacking. This study aims to quantify and characterize microplastics in the lung parenchyma and lymph nodes of patients with lung cancer and other respiratory diseases. Tissue samples will be collected during surgeries, and microplastic particles will be detected using FTIR microspectroscopy. The research may contribute to a better understanding of the role of microplastics in the development of respiratory diseases.

Environmental pollution from plastics has become one of the key global challenges, with microplastics-tiny particles resulting from plastic degradation-being increasingly detected in water, soil, and the atmosphere. Microplastics can enter the human body through ingestion or inhalation. According to studies (Prata et al., 2020), there is a risk of microplastics being present in the human respiratory system, raising public health concerns. Although research on microplastics in human lungs is still in its infancy, some preliminary studies suggest a potential link between their presence and decreased respiratory function or lung diseases (Chen et al., 2022). Hypothetically, microplastics could cause inflammatory reactions, disrupt metabolism, and contribute to lung cancer development. Additionally, it is speculated that inhaled microplastics could settle in lung tissue and spread to other organs through lymphatic and blood vessels, but this hypothesis remains unproven.

Given the limited data and the rising prevalence of respiratory disorders, this study aims to quantify and characterize microplastics present in the lung parenchyma and lymph nodes of patients with lung cancer and other respiratory diseases, such as emphysema or interstitial lung diseases. The study also seeks to clarify the role of microplastics in the development of these conditions. In future stages, the research will focus on uncovering the mechanisms through which microplastics affect lung tissues.

The study model involves analyzing lung tissue and lymph node samples from patients undergoing surgeries for lung cancer, emphysema, and interstitial lung diseases. Microplastic particles will be detected using infrared microspectroscopy (μFTIR). Lung parenchyma, lymph nodes, and blood samples will be collected with patient consent during surgery, and tissues will be stored at -80°C for further analysis.

Following established protocols (Jenner et al., 2022), microplastics will be identified using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. In addition to microplastic analysis, data on patients' medical history, occupational exposure, respiratory function, smoking habits, and COVID-19 history will be collected alongside surgical and histopathological findings.

The study anticipates detecting microplastics in the respiratory tract and identifying their types. It is possible that this research will establish a correlation between the presence of microplastics and the severity of lung diseases, potentially identifying a new risk factor for respiratory illnesses. Future research will delve deeper into the mechanisms through which microplastics may cause harmful health effects.
