Molecular Imaging of HER2 Expression in Breast Cancer Using [123I] I-(HE)3-G3
The study should evaluate distribution of \[123I\] I-(HE)3-G3 in patients with primary HER2-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer

DRUG: SPECT
Gamma camera-based whole-body [123I] I-(HE)3-G3 uptake value (%), Whole-body \[123I\] I-(HE)3-G3 uptake coinciding with normal organs and tissues will be assessed using gamma camera and calculated as percentage (%) of the injected dose of the radiopharmaceutical, 6 hours|SPECT-based [99mTc]Tc-G3-(G3S)3C uptake value in tumor lesions (counts) [123I] I-(HE)3-G3 uptake coinciding with tumor lesions will be assessed using single-photon emission computed tomography and measured in counts, SPECT-based \[99mTc\]Tc-G3-(G3S)3C uptake value in tumor lesions (counts) \[123I\] I-(HE)3-G3 uptake coinciding with tumor lesions will be assessed using single-photon emission computed tomography and measured in counts, 6 hours|SPECT-based [123I] I-(HE)3-G3 background uptake value (counts), Focal uptake of \[123I\] I-(HE)3-G3 in the regions without pathological findings will be assessed with SPECT and measured in counts, 6 hours|Tumor-to-background ratio (SPECT), The SPECT-based tumor-to-background ratio will be calculated as follows: the value of \[123I\] I-(HE)3-G3 uptake coinciding with tumor lesions (counts) will be divided by the value of \[123I\] I-(HE)3-G3 uptake coinciding with the regions without pathological findings (counts), 6 hours
Safety attributable to [123I] I-(HE)3-G3 injections (physical examination) (% of cases with abnormal findings relative to baseline), The safety attributable to \[123I\] I-(HE)3-G3 injections will be evaluated based on the assessments of physical examination (% of cases with abnormal findings relative to baseline), 48 hours|Safety attributable to [123I] I-(HE)3-G3 injections (vital signs) (% of cases with abnormal findings relative to baseline), The safety attributable to \[123I\] I-(HE)3-G3 injections will be evaluated based on the assessments of vital signs (% of cases with abnormal findings relative to baseline), 48 hours|Safety attributable to [123I] I-(HE)3-G3 injections (ECG) (% of cases with abnormal findings relative to baseline), The safety attributable to \[123I\] I-(HE)3-G3 injections will be evaluated based on the assessments of ECG (% of cases with abnormal findings relative to baseline), 48 hours|Safety attributable to [123I] I-(HE)3-G3 injections (laboratory tests) (% of cases with abnormal findings relative to baseline), The safety attributable to \[123I\] I-(HE)3-G3 injections will be evaluated based on the blood and urine laboratory tests (% of cases with abnormal findings relative to baseline), 48 hours|Safety attributable to [123I] I-(HE)3-G3 injections (% of incidence and severity of adverse events), The safety attributable to \[123I\] I-(HE)3-G3 injections will be evaluated based on the rate of adverse events (%), 48 hours
Overall goal of the project: To determine HER2 expression level in primary breast cancer before neoadjuvant system therapy.

Phase I. Distribution of HE3-G3 (\[123I\] I-(HE)3-G3) in patients with primary breast cancer. The study should evaluate distribution of HE3-G3 (\[123I\] I-(HE)3-G3) in patients with primary HER2-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer.
