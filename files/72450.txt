Assessing the Efficacy of Paclitaxel and Olaparib in Comparison to Paclitaxel / Carboplatin Followed by Epirubicin/Cyclophosphamide as Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Patients With HER2-negative Early Breast Cancer and Homologous Recombination Deficiency
This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label phase II study evaluating the efficacy and safety of PO→EC as neoadjuvant treatment of operable and locally advanced breast cancer in patients with HR deficiency. Patients will be randomized to receive

* paclitaxel 80 mg/m² iv weekly in combination with olaparib tablets 100 mg (4X25mg) twice daily for 12 weeks (65 patients) or
* paclitaxel 80 mg/m² iv weekly in combination with carboplatin AUC 2 iv weekly for 12 weeks (37 patients) both followed by 4 cycles of epirubicin 90 mg/m² and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m² (EC) either every 3 or every 2 weeks followed by surgery.

The control arm was chosen to allow direct comparison with one of the currently considered standard of care regimen.

response by pCR =ypT0/is ypN0, Assess the efficacy of olaparib in HER2-negative early Breast Cancer and HRD (BRCA 1/2 mutations and/or HRD positive). Pathological complete response of breast and lymph nodes (ypT0/is ypN0) defined as no microscopic evidence of residual invasive viable tumor cells in all resected specimens of the breast and axilla.

Pathological response will be assessed considering all removed breast and lymphatic tissues from all surgeries., 24 weeks
response by pCR =ypT0/is ypN0, To assess the pCR rates of patients receiving PO→EC and the pCR rates of patients receiving paclitaxel and carboplatin followed by EC (PCb→EC), 12 weeks|response by pCR =ypT0/is ypN0 in stratified subgroups, To assess the pCR rates (ypT0/is, ypN0) in the stratified subgroups, 24 weeks|response by pCR according to other definitions, To determine other pCR rates (ypT0 ypN0; ypT0 ypN0/+; ypT0/is ypN0/+; ypT(any) ypN0) of patients receiving PO→EC and to compare them with the pCR rates of patients receiving PCb→EC., 24 weeks|response by pCR in HRD high versus tBRCA, To assess the pCR rate in HRD high with vs without tBRCA mutation, 24 weeks|Response rate by sono and/or mammo, To determine the response rates of the breast tumor and axillary nodes based on physical examination and imaging tests (sonography, mammography, or MRI) with PO→EC and to compare it with PCb→EC. Clinical (c) and imaging (i) response will be assessed after EC and before surgery by physical examination and imaging tests. Sonography is the preferred examination, however, if sonography appears not to provide valid results or is not performed, other imaging tests will be considered., 12 weeks|Response rate by sono and/or mammo, To determine the response rates of the breast tumor and axillary nodes based on physical examination and imaging tests (sonography, mammography, or MRI) with PO→EC and to compare it with PCb→EC. Clinical (c) and imaging (i) response will be assessed after EC and before surgery by physical examination and imaging tests. Sonography is the preferred examination, however, if sonography appears not to provide valid results or is not performed, other imaging tests will be considered., 24 weeks|Breast Conservation rate, To determine the breast conservation rate with PO→EC and to compare it with PCb→EC. Breast conservation is defined as tumorectomy, segmentectomy or quadrantectomy as a most radical surgery., 24 weeks|Toxicity of treatment, To assess the toxicity and compliance of PO→EC and to compare it with PCb→EC. Tolerability and safety will be assessed on the basis of adverse events, serious adverse events, adverse events of special interest and treatment discontinuations. Safety by toxicity grades is defined by the NCI-CTCAE version 4.0., 24 weeks
Potential biomarkers predicting safety and compliance, like SNPs, TILs, PARP, 53BP1, REV7 and other biomarkers considered for breast cancer, To correlate co-occurring mutations detected by next generation sequencing in lymphocytes or in tumors cells with pCR (exploratory). Blood ampling before start of Treatment, after 12 and after 24 weeks, 24 weeks
The efficacy of olaparib in germline HRD score high with or without BRCA 1/2 mutation carriers with breast cancer is not well described

* The efficacy and safety of olaparib included in a standard of care regimen like paclitaxel weekly followed by epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (Pw--\>EC) is unknown
* Carboplatin increased the pCR rate in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) in two randomized phase II neoadjuvant studies when added to an anthracycline, cyclophosphamide and paclitaxel (GeparSixto, CALBG 40603). pCR rates were even higher in patients with germline BRCA 1 or 2 mutations (ypT0/is ypN0 65%) and with HRD score high (ypT0/is ypN0 63%).
* The TNT study showed a doubling in response rate for patients receiving carboplatin vs docetaxel in patients with germline BRCA 1 or 2 mutations.
* There is a high correlation between tumor and germline BRCA 1/2 mutations.
* Data from Geparsixto study showed that triple negative breast patients have an HR deficiency in about 70% (67% have a high HRD and 30% have a tBRCA mutation)
* About 5% of tBRCA patients have a low HRD score
* gBRCA2 patients are older when diagnosed and are more likely to have an HRpos tumor.
* The GeparOLA study aims to support the decision for a phase III study exploring the addition of olaparib to a Pw--\>EC schedule by providing an estimate on the pCR rate in the targeted population but also by providing estimate comparison to paclitaxel and carboplatin followed by epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (PCb--\>EC) as carboplatin is more and more considered a standard option of care in HR deficient patients (tBRCA 1/2 mutations and/or HRD score high).
