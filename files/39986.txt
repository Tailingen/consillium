89Zr-Trastuzumab PET/CT in Subjects With Previously Treated HER2-Positive Solid Tumors Scheduled to Receive Treatment With MT-5111
This is an open-label, single center, pilot study to assess the feasibility of baseline 89Zr-trastuzumab PET/CT to predict response to treatment with monotherapy MT-5111
