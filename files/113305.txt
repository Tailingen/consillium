Study on Application of Suturing Parathyroid Markers in Thyroid Cancer Surgery
To study the protective effect of suture parathyroid marker method on the function of parathyroid gland in thyroid cancer surgery
Thyroid Cancer|Hypoparathyroidism|Marker; Structural|Complication of Surgical Procedure|Parathyroid Function Low Adverse Event
PROCEDURE: The suture marks the location of the parathyroid gland
The stitch marking operation time, The time required for making a parathyroid marker by a suture method, During surgery|Specimen inspection time, The time required for finding parathyroid glands in surgical specimens, During surgery|The number of transplanted parathyroid glands, The number of parathyroid glands required for autotransplantation of parathyroid glands, When the surgery is completed|Parathyroid hormone level testing, Parathyroid hormone levels before and after surgery, 0 days, 1 day, 2 weeks after surgery|Calcium levels, Calcium level before and after surgery to detect, 0 days, 1 day, 2 weeks after surgery
This is a prospective randomized controlled study.In the experimental group, the suture parathyroid marker method was used to mark the parathyroid gland at the first time when it shows, and this marker was further used to identify and locating the inferior parathyroid marker in subsequent central region dissection. In the control group, the central area was routinely cleaned without suture parathyroid marker .
