Effect of Erythromycin Before Endoscopy of Patients With Subtotal Gastrectomy (STG), High Risk of Gastric Stasis
Erythromycin has a prokinetic effect through Motilin receptor. It evokes migrating motor complex with longer and stronger contraction.

In patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, It has been shown that erythromycin could clear the stomach of blood, so visual examination could be improved.

Frequent food stasis is encounted when we examine patients with subtotal gastrectomy. It is postulated that erythromycin reduce food stasis and help to improve endoscopy in these cases.
