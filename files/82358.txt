Identification of Predictive Factors for Survival of Patients With Recurrent Prostate Cancer From Clinical Features, Tissue Image Features and Molecular Biomarker Data
We seek to improve the predictive accuracy of the nomogram to predict survival for patients with castrate mets disease through the addition of pathological data, the results of automated machine vision based image analysis of H\&E stained tumor tissue developed at Aureon Biosciences,and molecular biomarker studies (25 markers) determined by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays prepared from paraffin-embedded tumor.
Prostate Cancer
The analysis for the progressive castrate mets disease population consists of two analytical steps. The first step involved the development of a predictive model of pt survival using supervised multivariate analytical (SMA)techniques, 2 years
