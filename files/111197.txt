Study design A Phase I, single-center, open-label, fixed-sequence study is designed to evaluate the effect of multiple-dose Itraconazole or Rifampicin Capsules on the single-dose PK profiles of IMP4297 Capsules in healthy Chinese subjects.

32 subjects are planned to be enrolled (at least 12 subjects complete the study on one side).

Two parallel groups will be planned in this study with 16 subjects enrolled in each group. Two cycles are set for each group. The first group will be given IMP4297 and Itraconazole in a fixed sequence (two dosing regimens); The second group will receive IMP4297 and Rifampicin in a fixed sequence (two dosing regimens).
