Individualized Molecular Profiling for Allocation to Clinical Trials (IMPACT) Project
This study aims to screen tumor molecular profile for better selection of anticancer treatment, in particular, allocation to clinical trials if available.
Solid Tumor
The molecular and clinical epidemiology for cancer patients being considered for novel therapeutics, 5 years
The proportion of patients who have actionable alterations and enrol into clinical trials, 5 years|The correlation of molecular profiles with clinical outcomes, 5 years
Molecular profiling will be performed on archival tumor tissue or freshly collected tumor tissue from re-biopsy. Blood, pleural fluid, FNA, and/or saliva may be collected to study the genetic makeup and also to compare the tumor molecular profile. Personalized therapy will be given based on molecular profile.
