Atypical MOLes and Melanoma Early Detection Study (MoleMed)
This is a multicenter, ambispective, low-interventional clinical study evaluating molecular genetic markers for non-invasive differential diagnosis of benign and malignant pigmented skin and mucosal neoplasms. In retrospective cohorts genetics markers will be identified. In prospective cohort non-invasive adhesive system will be tested to identify malignant or benign lesions with prespecified sensitivity and specificity compared to other non-invasive techniques (i.e. dermoscopy) and using histopathological examination as a "golden standard".

Sensitivity and specificity on the investigated non-invasive genetic method for diffrential diagnosis of benign and malignant melanocytic lesions compared to histopathological examination, â€¢Assessment of the sensitivity and specificity of a complex of molecular genetic studies applicable for non-invasive differential diagnosis of benign and malignant melanocytic neoplasms of the skin and mucous membranes in comparison with a standard histological examination, April 2020 - Nov 2022
Sensitivity and specificity on the investigated non-invasive genetic method for diffrential diagnosis of benign and malignant melanocytic lesions compared to other non-invasive diagnostic tools (i.e. dermoscopy), Assessment of the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative prognostic significance of the developed molecular genetic method for non-invasive differential diagnosis of benign and malignant pigmented neoplasms of the skin and mucous membranes in comparison with clinical diagnosis with an naked eye by an oncologist or dermatologist, up to 12 months|Describe some parameters of the identified malignant tumors, up to 12 months|Describe the frequency of relapse (local, regional and systemic) within the observation period, up to 3 years
