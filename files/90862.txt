Hycamtin Plus Carboplatin Versus Established Regimens for the Treatment of Ovarian Cancer Relapse
Determination of progression free survival after 12 months of FU

Determination of total survival, response and quality of life
Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: Topotecan
progression-free survival, after 1 year-follow-up
overall survival, efficacy and tolerability of the regimes and quality of life, during study and follow-up
In Germany there are two established therapy regimes for platin sensitive ovarian cancer: the combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel as well as the combination of carboplatin with gemcitabine. Choice of therapy is individual due to missing randomized comparisons between the regimes. Topotecan has shown good efficacy in second-line therapy of ovarian cancer as well as a good, especially, non-hematoxic toxicity profile. Several phase II-studies have demonstrated a synergistic effect of topotecan in combination with carboplatin exhibiting good efficacy and tolerability.

It shall be tested in this randomized phase III-study if the combination of topotecan and carboplatin shows improvement of progression-free survival in comparison to the standard regimes.
