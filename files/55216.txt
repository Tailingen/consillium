Pneumococcal Vaccine in Untreated CLL Patients
The purpose of the study is to determine whether patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) will benefit from vaccination with a 13-valent conjugated pneumococcal vaccine, Prevenar13, compared with a conventional 23-valent capsular polysaccharide vaccine in terms of immune response.
