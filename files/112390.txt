Zoledronic Acid in the Management of Patients With Asymptomatic/Early Stage Multiple Myeloma
Evidence for the beneficial effects of bisphosphonates on bone resorption in multiple myeloma has been reported extensively, showing reductions in skeletal events and improvement of several biochemical variables in bone resorption. Zoledronic acid (Zometa®, CGP42446) is the most potent clinically available bisphosphonates, with the largest therapeutic ratio between the desired inhibition of calcium resorption and the unwanted inhibition of mineralization in vitro of all the bisphosphonates.

This trial will investigate the efficacy of zoledronic acid in preventing skeletal events in patients with asymptomatic/early stage Multiple Myeloma
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Zoledronic Acid
· To examine the effect of intravenous zoledronic acid at the dose of 4 mg given every three months compared with observation, on percent change in bone mineral density of the spine at one year in patients with asymptomatic, smoldering and stage I MM., 18 months
· To examine the effect of intravenous zoledronic acid at the above schedule on percent change in bone mineral density of the total hip and femur., 18 months
