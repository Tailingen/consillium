The Predictive Scores for Gastric Cancer in Gastric Intestinal Metaplasia (GIM) Patient: a Recommendation for Thai Population
The predictive scores for gastric cancer in gastric intestinal metaplasia(GIM) patient: a recommendation for Thai population.

Objective:

To evaluate major risk factors for gastric cancer in gastric intestinal metaplasia(GIM) patient in order to propose the appropriate recommendation for Thai people.

Research Design:

Single center, retrospective-cohort study.
Gastric Intestinal Metaplasia
The prevalence of early gastric cancer in gastric intestinal metaplasia(GIM) patient from 5 year-follow-up in Thai population, In Thailand, gastric cancer patients usually presented with advance stage and carried the dismal prognosis. GIM is a well known precancerous lesion. The appropriate follow-up period in high risk GIM patient can increase the prevalence of early gastric cancer and reduce the mortality rate of gastric cancer, Up to 5 years
Study population and Sample size at Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University The patients who were diagnosed gastric intestinal metaplasia from 1997 to 2012 and then follow up for 5 years. Estimate sample size =280
