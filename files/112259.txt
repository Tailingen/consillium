Chemotherapy Plus Reduced Radiotherapy in Intracranial Germinoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the outcome of intracranial germinoma treated with chemotherapy plus reduced radiotherapy.
Intracranial Germinoma
DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Etoposide|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Bleomycin|RADIATION: Reduced dose of radiotherapy
Rate of late sequelae, Up to 5 years
Rate of event free survival, Up to 5 years
Treatment outcome of intracranial germinoma is excellent with radiotherapy/chemotherapy. However, late sequelae are unavoidable especially with craniospinal irradiation, and various efforts have been done to reduce the dose and extent of radiotherapy. In this study, chemotherapy and further reduced dose of radiotherapy will be used to minimize the late sequelae in the patients with intracranial germinoma.
