mHealth Physical Activity Intervention for Young Cancer Survivors
In this randomized controlled trial the investigators will determine whether a mobile health intervention can increase physical activity levels in AYA cancer survivors over a one year period. The investigators will recruit 320 cancer survivors in Alberta who were diagnosed with a first cancer between the ages of 15 to 39 years and are within one year of treatment completion. Participants will be randomized into either the control group (educational information) or the intervention group (educational information; personalized physical activity plan; activity tracker watch; access to a private, online survivor community; motivational text messages and check-in calls/e-mails). All participants will complete fitness testing and questionnaires at baseline, 6 months and 12 months. A final measurement at 24 months will test long-term effectiveness.

Background:

There is a need for adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer research because the number of new cancers in young people is increasing and the survivor population is growing. Interventions that try to reduce problems that affect people after cancer are particularly important since its treatments can have negative effects on survivors' physical and mental health even decades after diagnosis.

Aim:

Given the many positive effects of physical activity (e.g. improved fitness and quality of life), the study aims to encourage AYA cancer survivors to be more physically active as they shift from treatment to survivorship care. The main goal of this study is to see if a home-based, mobile health (mHealth) physical activity intervention can increase physical activity levels by at least 90 minutes/week compared to baseline in AYA cancer survivors.

Methods:

The investigators will conduct a two-center randomized controlled trial of 320 AYA cancer survivors. Participants (N=320) will be Albertan residents, diagnosed with a first cancer between the ages of 15 and 39 years, and within one year of cancer treatment completion. At the start of the study, participants will complete fitness testing and questionnaires. Participants will then be randomly put into either a control or intervention group. The control group will receive educational information only. The intervention group will also receive a personalized physical activity plan, an activity tracker watch, access to a private, online survivor community, motivational text messages and check-in calls/e-mails. Fitness testing and questionnaires will be repeated at 6 and 12 months to see if the intervention increased physical activity levels and improved health outcomes among the participants in the intervention group compared to controls. A final measurement at 24 months will test long-term use.
