QL1706 (PD-1/CTLA-4 Bi-specific Antibody) and Chemoradiotherapy in Locoregionally-advanced Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.
The trial aimed to compare QL1706 combined with induction chemotherapy plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy (IC+CCRT) versus IC+CCRT alone in High-risk Locoregionally-Advanced Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (LANPC).

DRUG: QL1706|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Cisplatin|RADIATION: Intensity-modulated radiotherapy
Failure-free survival (FFS) in intention-to-treat population, Multiple endpoint 1: calculated from randomization to the date of locoregional recurrence, distant metastasis, or death from any cause, whichever occurred first., 3 years|Overall survival (OS) in intention-to-treat population, Multiple endpoint 2: calculated from randomization to the date of death from any cause., 5 years
Failure-free survival (FFS) in per-protocol population, calculated from randomization to the date of locoregional recurrence, distant metastasis, or death from any cause, whichever occurred first., 3 years|Overall survival (OS) in per-protocol population, calculated from randomization to the date of death from any cause., 3 years|Locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRRFS), calculated from randomization to the date of locoregional persistence or 1st locoregional recurrence., 3 years|Distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), calculated from randomization to the date of first distant metastasis., 3 years|Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), Graded according to CTCAE V5.0., 3 years|Quality of life (QoL), The change of QoL from randomization to the start of radiotherapy, the end of radiotherapy, 13-16 weeks after radiotherapy, 2 years and 3 years after randomization. The EORTC QoL questionnaire-C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30）version 3.0 will be used. This questionnaire comprises 30 questions, 24 of which are aggregated into nine multi-question scales, that is, five functioning scales (e.g., physical), three symptom scales (e.g., fatigue) and one global health status scale. The remaining six single-question (e.g., dyspnoea) scales assess symptoms. These 15 scales will be scored according to the official Scoring Manual., week 1, 20, 40, 64|Failure-free survival (FFS) within different subgroups, analyses for FFS will be performed within the following subgroups: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA (≤4000copies/ml vs. \>4000copies/ml), different PD-L1 expression levels, age, gender, performance status, T category, N category, and stage (III vs. IVA)., 3 years|Tumor response, Evaluation of tumor response as CR, PR, SD, PD, NA by clinicians, Every 6 weeks（the time of completion of induction chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and adjuvnt immunotherapy; from the date of enrollment until the date of the last time that tumorimaging and assessment of disease has been done, assessed up to 74 weeks)
Correlation between pre-treatment PD-L1 expression level and FFS, Pre-treatment PD-L1 expression level of tumor cell is evaluated centrally by means of immunohistochemical testing., 3 years|Evaluate failure-free survival in the subgroup of plasma Epstein-Barr virus DNA level, Subgroup analysis, 3 years|Evaluate failure-free survival in the subgroup of clinical stage, Subgroup analysis, 3 years
The trial plans to enroll patients with stage T4N1and T1-4N2-3 (AJCC 9th) locoregionally-advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (LANPC). Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive 3 cycles of induction chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin and concurrent cisplatin-radiation or the same regimen plus QL1706 in induction chemotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy. All patients will receive intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). QL1706 will begin on day 1 of induction chemotherapy and continue every 3 weeks for 3 cycles in induction therapy and for 9 cycles in adjuvant therapy.
