Patient Controlled Epidural Analgesia Versus Intravenous Patient Controlled Analgesia for Post-Operative Pain Control in Patients Undergoing Elective Liver Resection
The purpose of this study is to learn whether patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) is a better method for managing pain after liver resection compared to patient-controlled analgesia (IV PCA). Currently, the standard pain control method for liver resection patients is IV PCA. There is not enough data on how epidural (PCEA) relieves pain and movement on a day to day basis after liver resection.
