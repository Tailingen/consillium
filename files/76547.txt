A Clinical Trial Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of Intravenous CD-801 in Treating Advanced HCC Patients
The goal of this investigator-initiated, a single-arm, open-label, pilot study is to investigate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of Intravenous CD-801 treatment in subjects with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC).

Condition of disease: advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.

Intervention： CD-801 will be administered intravenously for the treatment of HCC. The dosing regimen is planned for a second dose 14 ± 3 days post-initial treatment, followed by subsequent treatments every 28 ± 7 days, with adjustments made based on patient tolerance and therapeutic response. The trial is structured in two phases: dose escalation and dose expansion.

Dose Escalation Phase:

The study employs a i3+3 design to assess escalating CD-801 dosages: 25 μg, 50 μg, and 100 μg. Post-initial dose, a 14-day DLT observation will evaluate tolerability and safety, guiding dose adjustments or selection of the Recommended Dose (RD) for the expansion phase. Cohorts may include up to 9 participants, adjusted for safety.

Dose Expansion Phase:

The expansion phase will use the safe dosage and regimen from the escalation phase, with treatments starting 14 ± 3 days after the initial dose, then every 28 ± 7 days, adjusted as needed. It ends upon complete response, disease progression, toxicity, withdrawal, loss to follow-up, new oncological treatments, or investigator termination, with a final assessment 14 days post-last dose. The phase plans to enroll about 10 participants to further assess CD-801's safety, tolerability, and antitumor effects using mRECIST.

Drug: CD-801, a drug specifically designed to target liver cancer cells and facilitate the expression of HNF4α.

According to Amendment 1, in these two phases, patients who have received at least 4 cycles of HNF4α srRNA (CD-801 or CD-GA-102) therapy and have a tumor assessment of SD (stable disease) or PD (progressive disease) per mRECIST criteria may, after a comprehensive evaluation by the investigator considering the patient's treatment history and the current safety and efficacy data of HNF4α srRNA, continue HNF4α srRNA at the same dose, or have their dose adjusted, in combination with immunotherapy, targeted therapy, or chemotherapy.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common form of liver cancer. Recent advancements in understanding tumor biology and the tumor microenvironment, along with the approval of systemic therapeutic agents, including immunotherapy and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted agents, have dramatically transformed the treatment landscape for advanced stage HCC. However, the survival for advanced HCC patients still remains unsatisfactory.

Differentiation therapy in oncology is defined as a therapeutic strategy that reactivates endogenous differentiation programs and reverts malignant phenotypes. Its hallmark success is the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) by the combination of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic. Unfortunately, this approach has achieved limited success in solid tumors.

Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) is a transcription factor (TF) belonging to the nuclear receptor family. HNF4α is highly enriched in mature hepatocytes and serves as a master regulator of hepatocyte differentiation and hepatic metabolism. Previous studies, including our own and others, have demonstrated that the reduced expression of HNF4α plays a critical role in hepatocarcinogenesis. Restoring HNF4α expression induces the differentiation of HCC cells into mature hepatocytes and has shown significant therapeutic effects in various animal models of HCC.

In this study, the investigators developed CD-801, a drug specifically designed to target liver cancer cells and facilitate the expression of HNF4α, for the treatment of HCC patients. Preclinical studies have shown that CD-801 effectively inhibits the growth of subcutaneous and orthotopic liver tumors in mice. Acute toxicity tests in Sprague-Dawley rats have demonstrated that a single intravenous injection of CD-801 injection at a dose of 150 μg/animal is well-tolerated, with no significant toxicity, indicating good safety profiles.

This trial, structured in two phases: dose escalation and dose expansion, is a single-arm, open-label, exploratory clinical study aimed at evaluating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of CD-801 administered intravenously through a peripheral vein in the treatment of advanced-stage HCC. The treatment schedule is planned for a second dose 14 ± 3 days post-initial treatment, followed by subsequent treatments every 28 ± 7 days, with adjustments made based on patient tolerance and therapeutic response.
