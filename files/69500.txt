Follicular Lymphoma IV/SC Rituximab Therapy (FLIRT)
Patient will receive either one infusion of rituximab IV and seven administrations of rituximab SC (experimental arm) or four infusions of rituximab IV (standard arm).

The hypothesis is that the use of rituximab by sub cutaneous route and the scheme of administration could:

* optimize rituximab exposure leading to improve response rate
* increase adaptative response and then improve long-term control disease.
Follicular Lymphoma
DRUG: Rituximab IV|DRUG: Rituximab SC
Progression Free Survival (PFS), Time from randomization into the study to the first observation of documented disease progression or death due to any cause. If a subject has not progressed or died, PFS will be censored at the time of last visit with adequate assessment, 5.5 years
Overall Survival (OS), time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause. Alive patients will be censored at their last follow-up date., 5.5 years|Response Rates, Disease response evaluation, assessment will be based on the International Workshop to Standardize Response criteria for NHL (Criteria for evaluation of response in Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) according to Cheson 1999 (M3 and M12) and according to Cheson 2014 (M12 only).

The response rates will be described for each modality (CR, CRu, PR, SD and PD) and the Overall response rates (CR+CRu+PR) will also be described at the two time points (M3 \& M12)., M3 and M12|Best Response Rate during the study, Best disease response, assessment of response will be based on the International Workshop to Standardize Response criteria for NHL (Criteria for evaluation of response in Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (Cheson, 1999)).

The response rates will be described for each modality (CR, CRu, PR, SD and PD) and the Overall response rates (CR+CRu+PR) will also be described, M3 and M12|Time to Next Anti-Lymphoma Treatment (TTNLT), time from randomization to the date of first documented administration of any new anti-lymphoma treatment (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, radio-immunotherapy, immunotherapy...). Patients continuing in response or who are lost to follow-up will be censored on their last visit date. Patients who died (due to any cause) before having received a new anti-lymphoma treatment will be included in the statistical analysis with death being counted as an event., 5.5 years|Molecular Response, Bcl-2-IgH rearrangement, M3 and M12
Pharmacokinetic parameters of rituximab will be used to estimate individual area under the concentration curves of rituximab (AUC)., The AUC will be used to describe the relationship between rituximab pharmacokinetics and clinical response (objective response, survival)., 5.5 years|Causes of death, classification by cause of death, 5.5 years|Secondary cancers, classification by type of cancer, 5.5 years|Number of SAE from the first administration, for Rituximab SC as of C1 cohort, 1 year
