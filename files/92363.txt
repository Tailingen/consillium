Applying Artificial Intelligence to Optimize Early-stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma Treatment Based on Multi-modal Image
This study intends to establish two prognostic models based on contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and dynamic enhanced magnetic resonance (DE-MRI) multimodal images: prognostic model of liver cancer patients after hepatectomy and prognostic model of liver cancer patients after radiofrequency ablation. Combined with artificial intelligence imaging omics, traditional imaging omics and clinical information, to predict and compare the prognosis of two different treatment methods for early liver cancer, so as to realize the individual selection of treatment methods for early liver cancer patients
