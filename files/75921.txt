Study Evaluating Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin in Acute Myelogenous Leukemia After Stem Cell Transplant
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of gemtuzumab ozogamicin in relapsed CD33-positive AML patients who received HSCT. If the MTD dose is not reached, 9 mg/m2 will be the maximum tested dose. A secondary objective is to assess efficacy in terms of the number of patients attaining a complete (CR) or morphological (CRp) remission.
