Local and Peripheral Immune Responsive Landscape Induced by Local Cryoablation in Patients With Lung Adenocarcinoma
The goal of this observational study is to learn about local and peripheral immune and metabolic changes in patients with lung adenocarcinoma undergoing cryoablation. The main question it aims to answer are:

* local and peripheral immune changes in patients with lung adenocarcinoma undergoing cryoablation.
* local and peripheral metabolic changes in patients with lung adenocarcinoma undergoing cryoablation.

Peripheral blood, biopsy tissues of patients will be collected at the baseline and after cryoablation. Single-cell sequencing, single-cell immune bank, metabolomics and spatial metabolomics will be used to explore the local and peripheral immune changes and metabolites changes in patients with lung adenocarcinoma before and after cryoablation.
