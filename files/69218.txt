Collection of Biological Specimens and Associated Health Information
The purpose of this study is to collect blood samples from a large number of individuals with cancer to create a database for researchers to use in future studies. Researchers may use this database to discover new ways to detect and treat cancer and other diseases. Future studies may use stored blood samples to discover how genes affect health and disease.
