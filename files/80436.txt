Study of Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors and Carcinomas in Alsace Region
Pancreatic Neuroendocrine tumors and carcinomas (pNET) see the last year their incidence and prevalence going up. On the basis of their grade of differentiation and proliferation ratio measured Ki67 staining, there are divided into 3 grade groups : Grade 1 with Ki67 between 1 and 3%, Grade 2 between 3 and 20% and well-differentiated neuroendocrine grade tumors 3 with KI67 greater than 20%, so undifferentiated carcinomas.

pNET is a heterogenous group of tumors with variable prognosis. The aim of this study is to identify the prognostic factors in this population, as well the place of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio as a prognostic marker. The primary endpoint is the description of clinic and pathological parameters of patients from Alsace. The secondary endpoints are the identification of prognostic factors in this population
Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumor
The survival will be evaluated by Kaplan Meier Method. The prognostic factors will be evaluated with univariate and multivariate analysis by Cox regression model., The participant will be followed-up for a maximum of 11 years, and 1 year at least.
