A Study to Investigate Use of Off-the-shelf Natural Killer (NK) Cells (SAR445419) in Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This is a single group, Phase 1, single-arm, dose escalation study to determine the candidate dose(s), and evaluate safety, tolerability, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of SAR445419 administered after fludarabine and cytarabine conditioning for the treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (R/R AML). Adult participants with R/R AML will be eligible for treatment.

The study is intended to assess the candidate dose(s) by the occurrence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) from start of chemotherapy until 28 days after the first administration of SAR445419.

The duration of the study for a participant will include:

* Screening period up to 21 days prior to initiating chemotherapy,
* Treatment period of 5 days chemotherapy followed by SAR445419 administered for 2 weeks and end of treatment visit 56 days after first SAR445419 administration,
* Survival follow-up period up to 1 year after the last participant has started treatment with SAR445419.

Participants will be followed for 28 days (for DLT evaluations) after administration of the first SAR445419 dose (Day 1) for the primary endpoint and for 1 year after the first SAR445419 dose for selected secondary endpoints.
