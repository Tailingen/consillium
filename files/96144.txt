Study on the Role of Hormonal Treatment for Two Dosage Levels of Prostate Radiation Therapy Versus Prostate Radiation Therapy Alone
The hypothesis of the proposed study would be that, due to the six months of total androgen blockade, which would include neoadjuvant hormonal therapy for four months and concomitant hormonal therapy for two months with irradiation, the investigators could reduce local failure rates for these two dosage levels, namely 70 Gy and 76 Gy. Since increasing the dose to the prostate also seems to reduce local relapse rates, the results of the two hormonal therapy groups would be compared with the results of prostate irradiation at doses of 76 Gy. This study would verify the possibility of compensating a six Gy dosage increase of radiation therapy with six months of hormonal therapy between the 70 Gy and 76 Gy groups who received hormonal therapy, and also match these results with a dose escalation to the prostate of 76 Gy. In the future, this could result in more therapeutic choices, such as reducing the doses of radiation therapy and, consequently, its related complications, if hormonal therapy proves to be beneficial; or rather, to continue in the direction of dose escalation for this intermediate-risk patient group, everything being correlated to the side effects of hormonal therapy and irradiation.
