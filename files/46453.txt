CAR T Cells in Patients With MMP2+ Recurrent or Progressive Glioblastoma
This is a phase 1b study to evaluate the safety of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells with a chlorotoxin tumor-targeting domain (ie, CHM-1101, the study treatment) to determine the best dose of CHM-1101, and to assess the effectiveness of CHM-1101 in treating MMP2+ glioblastoma that has come back (recurrent) or that is growing, spreading, or getting worse (progressive).

This is a phase 1b, multicenter, feasibility/safety study of the dual delivery (administered through both intracavitary/intratumoral \[ICT\] and intraventricular \[ICV\] catheters) of CHM-1101, an autologous chlorotoxin-chimeric antigen receptor (CLTX-CAR) cell product, in participants with recurrent or progressive GBM. The investigational product is identified as CHM-1101 (CLTX(EQ)28ζ/CD19t+ CAR T cells).

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE

• To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for dual ICT and ICV delivery of CHM-1101 in participants with MMP2+ recurrent or progressive GBM.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

* To assess the feasibility and safety of dual delivery of CHM-1101.
* To describe the persistence, expansion, immunogenicity, and phenotype of CHM-1101 and endogenous cells tumor cyst fluid (TCF), peripheral blood (PB), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
* In participants who receive at least 2 of the 3 planned doses of CHM-1101 in Cycle 1:

  * Estimate the progression-free survival (PFS) rates
  * Estimate the overall survival (OS) rates
* To evaluate the disease response rate.
