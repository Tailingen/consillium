Effect of Preoperative Chemoradiotherapy on Exercise Capacity as Measured by Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing
This study will investigate the effect of preoperative chemoradiotherapy on exercise capacity as measured by cardiopulmonary exercise testing in patients with colorectal cancer.
Colorectal Cancer
OTHER: Cardiopulmonary exercise testing
Change of Anaerobic threshold of 1.5ml/min/kg or more, 6 weeks
Operative outcome, 6-10 weeks
Chemoradiotherapy is associated with adverse effects. Patients with certain colorectal cancers undergo chemoradiotherapy prior to surgical resection. We intend to assess patient exercise capacity before and after chemoradiotherapy to assess whether this deteriorates. If there is a deleterious effect, this may affect operative outcome.
