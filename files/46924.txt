Nivolumab Plus Ramucirumab in Patients With Recurrent, Advanced, Metastatic NSCLC
The study will enroll patients with prior IO therapy (alone or in combination with chemotherapy or in combination with other IO agents) regardless of the PD-L1 level, into a non-randomized combination trial, with primary endpoint of disease control rate.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: Ramucirumab
Disease control rate (DCR) in IO experienced patients.treated with nivolumab and ramucirumab combination therapy, DCR is defined as number of patients with stable disease, complete or partial response as determined by RECIST 1.1 criteria, 12 months
Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the number of patients with partial response or complete response as determined by RECIST 1.1 criteria, 12 months|Progression free survival (PFS) at 6 months, Number of patients with progression free survival (PFS). 1. PFS is defined as the length of time from the start of treatment to time of disease progression or death, whichever occurs first, as determined by RECIST 1.1 criteria, 12 months|Number of patients with treatment related toxicities in IO naive patients treated with nivolumab and ramucirumab combination therapy, Toxicity is determined by NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03, 12 months|Overall survival in IO experienced patients treated with nivolumab and ramucirumab combination., Defined by the number of patients alive at the end of the study, 60 months
Immunotherapeutic treatment with check-point inhibitors has increased survival in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that does not have any mutation to be targeted. However, the concept that tumors evade immune surveillance through a variety of mechanisms, and that activating the immune system can lead to tumor regression in a variety of tumor types has been known for decades. Thus, this study combines the effects to blocking 2 different pathways- inhibition of PD-1 pathway and angiogenic pathway via inhibition of VEGR signaling to improve survival as blocking each pathway individually has demonstrated a modest increment. There has been no study using nivolumab in combination with a VEGFR2 inhibitor, a drug which has both anti-angiogenic and pleotropic immunomodulatory effects and may synergize with the effect of an anti-PD-1 agent, in solid tumors. Activating the anti-tumor effects of T cells by utilizing multiple pathways of both nivolumab and ramucirumab is an endeavor which merits investigation.

Thus, the study investigates the synergistic effect of targeted anti-antitumor activity of immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab and immune-suppressive activity of VEGF-inhibitor ramicirumab expecting a favorable overall survival in NSCLC patients, with the additional benefit of tolerable toxicities.
