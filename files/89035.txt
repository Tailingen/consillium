Stoma Closure and Reinforcement Trial
Hernia formation at sites of ostomy closure is a common complication. The investigator believes that using evidence based hernia repair techniques as a preventive measure during closure of ostomies will reduce the incidence of hernia formation. In this trial, the investigator will pilot a novel technique of large pore monofilament polypropylene mesh reinforcement of the abdominal wall defects that remain after closure of an ileostomy to evaluate for safety and begin to evaluate the effectiveness compared to standard techniques.
Colon Cancer|Rectal Cancer|Ileostomy - Stoma
DEVICE: Mesh Implantation
Number of Participants With Wound Occurrences, Incidence of wound occurrences (defined as superficial surgical site infection \[s-SSI\], deep surgical site infection \[d-SSI\], organ space surgical site infection \[O-SSI\], dehiscence, and seroma formation) at 30 days, with particular attention to wound occurrences requiring procedural intervention, including but not limited to, operative debridement, radiographically guided drain placement, or excision of the mesh will be assessed., 30 days|Number of Participants With Wound Occurrences in Current Study Compared to Historical Controls, The incidence of wound occurrences (defined as superficial surgical site infection \[s-SSI\], deep surgical site infection \[d-SSI\], organ space surgical site infection \[O-SSI\], dehiscence, and seroma formation) at 30days, with particular attention to wound occurrences requiring procedural intervention, including but not limited to, operative debridement, radiographically guided drain placement, or excision of the mesh will be compared to historical controls., 30 days
Preliminary Efficacy Based on Number of Participants With Hernia Formation, Evaluation of the incidence of hernia formation at the ileostomy site on a prospective basis at 30 days and 6 month intervals thereafter until two years from the date of ileostomy closure using computed tomography and clinical examination., 30 days, and then 6 months post procedure|Bowel Function After Mesh Implantation, Patient will be evaluated with regards to their bowel function outcomes utilizing the Colorectal Function Outcome (COREFO) instrument to evaluate bowel function. Score range is 0-100, Higher score indicates worse bowel function., 2 years|Quality of Life After Mesh Implantation, Patient will be evaluated with regards to their quality of life outcomes utilizing the Promis SF 2.0 8a Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities instrument. Score range is 0-40, Higher scores represents better quality of life, 2 years
