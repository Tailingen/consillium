MC1R-targeted Alpha-particle Monotherapy and Combination Therapy Trial With Nivolumab in Adults With Advanced Melanoma
In this first-in human, phase I/IIa study, the safety and efficacy of \[212Pb\]VMT01, an alpha-particle emitting therapeutic agent targeted to melanocortin sub-type 1 receptor (MC1R) is being evaluated as a monotherapy and in combination with Nivolumab in subjects with unresectable and metastatic melanoma.

This is a prospective, multi-center open-label dose-escalation, dose-expansion study of \[212Pb\]VMT01 as a monotherapy or in combination with Nivolumab in up to 264 subjects with histologically confirmed melanoma and a positive MC1R imaging scan with imaging agents \[203Pb\]VMT01 or \[68Ga\]VMT02.

MC1R is a receptor that is expressed on the surface of melanoma cells and therefore is an attractive therapeutic target for melanoma treatment. Lead-212 (\[212Pb\]-) based peptide-radiopharmaceuticals are an emerging class of targeted alpha-particle cancer therapies that have potential to improve delivery of a highly effective form of radiation.

This study will be conducted in 3 parts:

Part 1: Monotherapy Dose-Escalation: \[212Pb\]VMT01 is administered alone in escalating doses to determine the Maximum Tolerated radioactivity Dose (MTD), Maximum Feasible radioactivity Dose (MFD), and potential recommended Phase 2 doses (RP2Ds)

Part 2: Combination-Therapy Dose-Escalation: \[212Pb\]VMT01 and Nivolumab are administered in escalating doses to determine MTD, MFD, and RP2Ds.

Part 3: Dose Expansion: This part will enroll subjects in monotherapy and combination-therapy expansion cohorts based on the identified MTD, MFD, and RP2D for the selection of \[212Pb\]VMT01 alone and \[212Pb\]VMT01-Nivolumab combination doses for further clinical development.

Enrolled subjects in Monotherapy part may receive up to 3 doses of \[212Pb\]VMT01 approximately 8 weeks apart and subjects in combination therapy may receive nivolumab every 4 weeks for up to 24 months.

A Dosimetry sub-study utilizing an imaging surrogate, \[203Pb\]VMT01, has been incorporated into the study in order to assess organ biodistribution and tumor uptake of the investigational products. This study will also estimate radiation dosimetry and correlate uptake of the investigation products with observed toxicities and efficacy.
