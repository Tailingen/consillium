A Study of Ado-trastuzumab Emtansine (T-DM1)-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy in HER2-positive Breast Cancer Patients
Researchers plan to study the natural history of ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1)-induced neuropathy both in patients without any history of neuropathy or previous neurotoxic agent use and in patients who have such a history.
Breast Neoplasm
Change in chronic neuropathy symptoms, Measured using the European Organisation of Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) twenty-item scale (EORTC QLQCIPN20), a validated instrument designed to elicit cancer patients' experience of symptoms and functional limitations related to chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. The total score of CIPN20, each of the three subscale scores (sensory, motor, autonomic), and each individual item of the CIPN20 tool will be computed following standard scoring algorithm and converted into a 0-100 scale; higher scores indicate greater severity of neuropathy symptoms., Baseline, approximately 22 months
