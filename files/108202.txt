Laser Ablation in Stereotactic Neurosurgery (LAISE): NeuroBlate速 Retrospective Registry
The NeuroBlate速 System (NBS), is a minimally invasive robotic laser thermotherapy tool. It employs a pulsed surgical laser to deliver targeted energy to abnormal brain tissue caused by tumors and lesions. Since receiving FDA clearance in April 2013, the NBS has been used in nearly 300 procedures conducted at approximately 20 leading institutions across the United States. This post-market, multi-center retrospective study is designed to collect long-term follow-up data on patients who were treated previously with NBS.
