Cost-effectiveness Study of miRview™ Mets in Patients With Cancer of Unknown Primary (CUP)
The aim of the study is in cancer of unknown primary (CUP) patients, to compare the cost-effectiveness of miRview™ mets test with conventional work-up in identifying the primary tumor site.
Neoplasms, Unknown Primary
cost-effectiveness, To compare the cost-effectiveness of miRview™ mets test with conventional work-up in cancer of unknown primary (CUP) patients, by comparing total cost and time of the diagnostic process (including hospitalization time) from day 1 of the study to the decision on treatment program, 18 months
compare the diagnostic performance, 1. Evaluating the miRview™ mets results based on the clinical and pathological work-up in all patients (retrospectively).
2. Evaluating the concordance between miRview™ mets result and the diagnosis obtained by the standard work-up process.
3. Comparing the response to treatment between study groups.
4. Comparing overall survival between study groups, 18 months
Thousands of patients are diagnosed each year with metastatic cancer; however, about 3-5% of them are diagnosed with Cancer of Unknown Primary (CUP). In order to identify the optimal treatment plan for individual patients with CUP, the primary tumor site must be identified. Patients undergo a wide range of costly, time-consuming, and inefficient tests to identify the primary site of origin, often to no avail.

In this era of targeted therapies, the accurate diagnosis of the primary tumor can be crucial. miRview™ mets is a new molecular diagnostic tool that identifies the tissue-of-origin of metastatic tumors, with 90% sensitivity.
