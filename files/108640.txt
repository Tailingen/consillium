A Personal Cancer Vaccine (NEO-PV-01) With Pembrolizumab and Chemotherapy for Patients With Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to find out if treatment with NEO-PV-01 in combination with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy (pembrolizumab/chemotherapy) is safe and useful for patients with lung cancer. The study also will assess if the NEO-PV-01 vaccine, when given together with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy, can improve your response compared with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy treatment alone. All eligible patients will receive NEO-PV-01 + Adjuvant, pembrolizumab and chemotherapy while on this trial.

This clinical trial will enroll patients with advanced or metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung carcinoma not having received treatment for metastatic disease. The five agents being used in this study are:

* A new, investigational, personalized cancer vaccine called "NEO-PV-01"
* Poly-ICLC (Hiltonol), an investigational adjuvant that is used to help stimulate the immune system
* A cancer drug called pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®)
* A chemotherapy called pemetrexed (ALIMPTA®)
* A chemotherapy called carboplatin

Both NEO-PV-01 and pembrolizumab are considered immunotherapies and work using the immune system to fight cancer. NEO-PV-01 is a custom made vaccine for you that is based on the specific targets on your cancer. Poly-ICLC is an adjuvant that helps stimulate the immune system and make the vaccine, NEO-PV-01, more effective.

Pembrolizumab helps T-cells, a certain type of immune cell, that recognize these targets to reach and attack your cancer. Pembrolizumab, which is approved in the USA and some other countries, is available by prescription to treat several different cancers, including the type of cancer that you have. Recently, the FDA also approved the combination of Pembrolizumab with chemotherapy for the treatment of your type of lung cancer. This combination works better than each of the drugs on their own.

The purpose of this study is to find out if treatment with NEO-PV-01 in combination with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy is safe and useful for patients with lung cancer. The study also will assess if the NEO-PV-01 vaccine, when given together with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy, can improve your immune response compared with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy treatment alone. The side effects of NEO-PV-01, pembrolizumab, and chemotherapy will be monitored and additional research tests will be done to assess your immune response to your cancer.
