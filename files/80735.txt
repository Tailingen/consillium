A Study Comparing Rituximab/Bendamustin(RB) Alternating With Rituximab/Bendamustin/Cytarabin(RBAC) With RB Therapy in Elderly Patients With Mentle Cell Lymphoma
This is a phase 2, multicenter, open-label, active-controlled randomized trial to determine efficacy and safety of rituximab/bendamustine (RB) alternating with rituximab/bendamustine/cytarabine (RBAC) compared with standard RB alone in the first-line treatment of elderly patients with mantle cell lymphoma, who are not eligible for high-dose therapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation.
Mantle Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: RB/RBAC alternating|DRUG: RB
Progression-freesurvival, Up to 84 months
Overall Survival, Up to 84 months|Duration of Response, Up to 84 months|Event Free Survival, Up to 84 months|Overall response rate, Up to 84 months|Adverse events, From the day 1 of the clinical trial to 28 days after last drug administration
Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to either the investigational treatment arm (RB alternating with RBAC) or the standard treatment arm (RB) in a 1:1 ratio. Patients will be stratified by age (â‰¥70 years vs. 60-69), histologic morphology (blastoid/pleomorphic vs. non-blastoid/non-pleomorphic), and MIPI-C risk score (0/1 vs. 2/3).
