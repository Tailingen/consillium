VMAT Concurrent Cisplatin Plus Nab-paclitaxel for Local Advanced Cervical Cancer
This is a single arm, open-lable Phase I clinical trial. Eligible patients will have Histologically proven stage IB2-IVA cervical cancer. We hypothesize that Nab-paclitaxel in combination with cisplatin and radiotherapy may have anti-tumor activity in patients with cervical cancer. Nab-paclitaxel has not previously been combined with conventional RT-CT to treat cervical cancer.
Cervical Cancer
DRUG: Drug: Cisplatin; nab-paclitaxel
Maximum Tolerated Dose(MTD)/Recommended Dose(RD), Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) will be defined during the Dose Escalation Stage based on evaluation of the number of patients with Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLT). The MTD will be used to determine the Recommended Dose (RD)., Up to 5 weeks
Number of patients with Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), Dose-limiting toxicity is defined as an adverse event that is considered to be drug-related and meets one of the Protocol definitions., Up to 5 weeks|Objective response rate (ORR), ORR was assessed by the site Investigator using RECIST 1.1 and was defined as the percentage of patients with a confirmed overall response of CR or PR., Up to 5 weeks
During the phase I study, patients will receive radiation therapy to pelvis (50.4 Gy in 28fractions), and followed by HDR intracavitary (30Gy in 5 fractions) brachytherapy. Concurrent chemotherapy was administered with weekly cisplatin (40 mg/m\^2) and an escalating dose of weekly Nab-paclitaxel starting at 10 mg/m\^2 up to 70 mg/m\^2. Chemotherapy agents were administered in escalating doses to cohorts of three patients at each dose level.
