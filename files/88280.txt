Phase II Trial Evaluating OS With TherasphereÂ® + 2nd-Line FOLFOX in Pancreatic Liver Mets
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and impact on survival with treatment with 90-Y glass microspheres in conjunction with leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) as second-line treatment with in patients gemcitabine-refractory metastatic pancreatic cancer with predominantly liver metastases.

Median Overall Survival (OS), OS, defined as the time from study enrollment to death from any cause, will be analyzed and summarized with the survival probabilities over time using Kaplan-Meier method. Confidence intervals for the median OS rates at different time points will be constructed when appropriate., Up to 29 months
Rate of Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS defined as the time from study enrollment to progression in the liver by modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) or death, whichever occurs first will be analyzed and summarized with the survival probabilities over time using Kaplan-Meier method. Confidence intervals for the median PFS rates at different time points will be constructed when appropriate., Up to 29 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR), The overall response: ORR = complete response (CR) + partial response (PR). Rate will be summarized using both point estimates and exact confidence intervals based on the binomial distribution by groups., Up to 29 months
