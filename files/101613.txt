Clinical Study of Ixabepilone Administered as a 24 Hour Infusion in Patients With Solid Malignancies.
The purpose of this study is to determine the dose limiting toxicities, minimum tolerated dose and recommended dose for Phase II studies.
Solid Malignancies
DRUG: Ixabepilone
Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities at Dose Level, Dose limiting toxicities=any of the following events attributed to Ixabepilone occuring during the first cycle: grade 3/4 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea despite medical intervention and/or prophylaxis; other Grade ≥3 nonhematological toxicity; any toxicity requiring study therapy discontinuation; delayed recovery from study therapy-related toxicity which delays scheduled re-treatment for \>14 days; Grade 4 neutropenia for ≥5 consecutive days; grade 3/4 neutropenia with sepsis or a fever ≥38.5 C; thrombocytopenia \<25,000 cells/mm3 or bleeding requiring a platelet transfusion., Measures taken at Cycle 01 (21-day cycle)
Treatment Related Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Deaths, and AEs Leading to Discontinuation, Adverse events (AEs) and Serious AEs (SAEs) considered possibly, probably, or certainly related to study treatment, graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 3.0 (Grade 1=Mild, Grade 2=Moderate, Grade 3=Severe, Grade 4=Life-threatening or disabling, Grade 5=Death)., From time of screening through post study follow-up at a maximum of 21 9-day cycles. Toxicity assessments occured at least every 4 weeks until all study drug related toxicities.|Hematology Results - Worst On-Study Grade, Worst on-study grade based on laboratory values graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 3.0. (Grade 1=Mild, Grade 2=Moderate, Grade 3=Severe, Grade 4=Life-threatening or disabling, Grade 5=Death)., Baseline (within 2 weeks of dosing), weekly, and within 72 hours prior to each subsequent 21-day cycle. If CTC Grade 4 hematologic toxicity is observed, complete blood count plus differential and platelets repeated every 3 days until resolution.|Mean Plasma Concentration of Ixabepilone at 40 mg/m2 Dose Level, Mean concentrations over full time period for the 40 mg/mg2 dose level, established as the Maximum Tolerated Dose. (The Maximum Tolerated Dose was established as 40 mg/m2, based on an investiagtion of Dose Limiting Toxicities, which consisted of Febrile Neutropenia (at 40 mg/m2) in 1 participant and Grade 4 neutropenia lasting ≥5 days (at 45 mg/m2)in 2 participants.), through 72 hours after start of infusion|Best Tumor Response, According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), RECIST criteria, wherein complete response = disappearance of all target lesions; partial response = 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; progressive disease = 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, and stable disease = small changes that do not meet above criteria., At Baseline (up to 2 weeks prior to starting therapy), after every 2nd cycle, and at post study follow-upn after a maximum of 9 cycles.
The purpose of this study is to determine the dose limiting toxicities, minimum tolerated dose and recommended dose for Phase II studies.
