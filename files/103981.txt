Study to Assess Efficacy and Safety of NS-018 Compared to BAT in Patients With Myelofibrosis
This study will enroll male and female subjects who are 18 years of age or older with Primary Myelofibrosis, post-polycythemia Vera Myelofibrosis, or post-essential Thrombocythemia Myelofibrosis with severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count \<50,000/µL) including subjects with intermediate-2 or high-risk MF according to the Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System (DIPSS).

DRUG: NS-018|DRUG: Best Available Therapy
Change in Spleen Volume, Proportion of subjects who achieve ≥35% reduction in spleen volume from baseline compared to Week 24 as measured by MRI (or by CT for applicable subjects), baseline and week 24|Change in Total Symptom Score (TSS), Proportion of subjects who achieve ≥50% reduction in total symptom score from baseline compared to Week 24 as measured by the MF-SAF v4.0, baseline and week 24
Change in Spleen Volume, Proportion of subjects in NS-018 vs BAT arm who achieve ≥35% reduction in spleen volume from baseline at any time up to Week 24 as measured by MRI (or by CT for applicable subjects), from baseline to anytime before or at week 24|Comparison of Treatment-emergent AEs Between NS-018 and BAT, Laboratory events graded by the NCI CTCAE v5.0 will be assessed in both arms, to compare the safety profile of NS-018 versus BAT., from baseline to week 24
NS-018 will be self-administered orally at a dose of 300 mg BID. The BAT will be administered according to manufacturer's instructions and Investigator discretion. Subjects will complete study visits at Screening, Day 1 and Day 15 of Cycle 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and Day 1 of every cycle thereafter. At these visits, blood/urine sampling, spleen measurements, bone marrow assessments, patient-reported outcome (PRO) assessments, and safety assessments may be performed.
