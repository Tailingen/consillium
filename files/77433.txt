PRF Membrane and Recovery After Periapical Surgery: A 3D Imaging Study
The goal of this clinical trial is to determine whether a PRF (platelet-rich fibrin) membrane helps improve recovery after periapical surgery in adults. The main questions it seeks to answer are:

Does the use of a PRF membrane reduce swelling and pain after surgery? Does the use of a PRF membrane improve healing as observed on 3D imaging? Researchers will compare the outcomes of participants who receive a PRF membrane during surgery with those who do not, to assess whether the PRF membrane improves recovery.

Participants will:

Undergo periapical surgery with or without the use of a PRF membrane. Have swelling and pain assessed at specific time points after surgery. Participate in 3D imaging scans to evaluate healing.

Participants will:

Undergo periapical surgery with or without the use of a PRF membrane. Have swelling and pain measured at specific time points after surgery. Take part in 3D imaging scans to evaluate healing.

PROCEDURE: Platelet-Rich Fibrin (PRF) Membrane
Change in Quality of Life (QoL) Using the PROMIS-29+2 Profile v2.1, Quality of life (QoL) was evaluated using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 29+2 Profile v2.1 questionnaire, a validated tool assessing health-related QoL across multiple domains, including physical function, emotional stress, sleep disturbance, and social tasks. Each domain is scored using a standardized T-score scale, ranging from 20 (lowest) to 80 (highest), where higher scores indicate better quality of life.

Time Points: Preoperative and Day 7 postoperative.

Unit of Measure: PROMIS T-score (range: 20-80)., Preoperative and Day 7 postoperative.|Change in Pain Intensity Using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Pain intensity was measured daily using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), a validated tool for assessing patient-reported pain. The VAS scale ranges from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain), where higher scores indicate worse pain outcomes. Measurements were taken daily for seven days following surgery.

Time Points: Daily from Day 0 (day of surgery) to Day 7 postoperative.

Unit of Measure: Scale Points (range: 0-10)., Daily assessments from Day 0 (day of surgery) to Day 7 postoperative.|Change in Postoperative Swelling Using 3D Optical Scans, Postoperative swelling was measured volumetrically using 3D optical scans performed with the Einstar 3D scanner (Shining 3D, Hangzhou, China). Measurements were taken preoperatively (T0) and on Day 3 postoperative (T1). Swelling volume is expressed in cubic centimeters (cm³), where a higher volume indicates greater swelling.

Time Points: Preoperative (T0) and Day 3 postoperative (T1).

Unit of Measure: Cubic centimeters (cm³)., Measurements were taken at T0 (preoperative) and T1 (Day 3 postoperative).
