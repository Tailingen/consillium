Phase II Trial of Lapatinib & Capecitabine for Patients With Refractory Advanced Colorectal Adenocarcinoma
The purpose of this study is to find out how effective this combination is as a second line treatment for colorectal cancer that has spread from one part of the body to another (metastasized) or has not metastasized but is considered inoperable (unable to be removed by surgery). The side effects and survival experienced by subjects receiving these drugs will also be evaluated. This is a phase II research study.
