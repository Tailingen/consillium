Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of a Thoracic and Abdominal Endoscopic Surgical System
Evaluation of the efficacy and safety of thoracic and abdominal endoscopic surgical systems manufactured by Shenzhen Cornerstone Robotics Technology Co., Ltd. for use in general, gynaecological and thoracic surgical procedures.
Pathologic Stage I Gastric Cancer AJCC v8|Colorectal Cancer|Esophageal Cancer|Hepatectomy|Radical Hysterectomy
PROCEDURE: Robot-assisted surgery
Surgical non-referral rate, Surgical untransferred is defined as not converted from an experimental medical device assisted method to another surgical device control system assisted, laparoscopic surgery or open surgery., during the surgery
The surgeon's operating time, Operative time（minutes）, during the surgery|Length of postoperative stay, Total number of days the patient was in hospital from the day of surgery to discharge., up to 12 weeks|Intraoperative blood loss, Estimated blood loss（milliliters，ml）, during the surgery|Length of stay, The postoperative day when patients complied with the predefined discharge criteria, The patient's total number of days from the day of surgery to discharge was recorded 30 days postoperatively.
The trial was designed using a prospective, multi-centre, single-group target value approach.

For subjects who intend to undergo general surgery, gynaecological surgery and thoracic surgery assisted by the Thoracic and Abdominal Endoscopic Surgical System.

To use the Thoracic and Abdominal Endoscopic Surgical System developed by Shenzhen Cornerstone Robotics Technology Co., Ltd. to perform surgery in the above three disciplines, and to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the experimental medical device in the surgical treatment of the above three disciplines.
