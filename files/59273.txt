DRUG: ixabepilone
The proportion of patients with clinical response measured using RECIST criteria, Up to 3 years
Toxicity graded using the NCI CTC version 2.0, Up to 30 days after completion of study treatment
OBJECTIVES:

I. Determine the response rate of patients with advanced carcinoma of the urothelium treated with ixabepilone.

II. Assess the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to prior treatment with taxanes (yes vs no).

Patients receive ixabepilone IV over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 1 year.
