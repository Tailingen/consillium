Treatment Combination of Durvalumab, Tremelimumab and Enfortumab Vedotin or Durvalumab and Enfortumab Vedotin in Patients With Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer Ineligible to Cisplatin or Who Refuse Cisplatin
A global phase 3, multicenter, randomized, trial, to Determine the Efficacy and Safety of Durvalumab in combination with Tremelimumab and Enfortumab Vedotin or Durvalumab in combination with Enfortumab Vedotin for Perioperative Treatment in Patients Ineligible for Cisplatin or who refuse Cisplantin Undergoing Radical Cystectomy for Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer.

The goal of the study is to explore the triplet combination of Durvalumab, Tremelimumab and Enfortumab Vedotin or the duplet combination of Durvalumab and Enfortumab vedotin in terms of efficacy and safety compared to the current Standard Of Care (SOC).

Volga trial consists of two parts: Safety Run-In and Main Study. In total the study aims to enroll approximately 677 patients, who will receive triplet combination, duplet combination or currently approved SOC in the main trial. In the main part of the trial there is two out of three chances of being on a treatment arm and the treatment is assigned at random by a computer system.

In this trial patients in the two treatment arms will receive either 3 cycles of neoadjuvant Durvalumab + Tremelimumab + Enfortumab Vedotin or Durvalumab + Enfortumab vedotin and after surgery both treatment arms will continue with adjuvant Durvalumab.
