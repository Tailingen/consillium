A Study of Nab-Paclitaxel and Carboplatin Plus Necitumumab (LY3012211) in Participants With Stage IV Squamous NSCLC
The purpose of the study is to determine if nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin chemotherapy plus necitumumab is effective and safe in participants with stage IV squamous non-small cell lung cancer.
Carcinoma, Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
DRUG: Necitumumab|DRUG: Nab-Paclitaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin
Percentage of Participants Who Achieve Best Overall Tumor Response of Complete Response or Partial Response (Objective Tumor Response Rate [ORR]), ORR was the percentage of participants achieving a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. CR defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no appearance of new lesions. PR defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters (LD) of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline sum LD), no progression of nontarget lesions, and no appearance of new lesions. Progressive disease (PD) was at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, with reference being the smallest sum on study and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm, or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, or 1 or more new lesions., From Date of Randomization to Objective Disease Progression (Up to 18 Months)
Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS defined as time from date of randomization until first radiographic documentation of measured PD defined by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) v1.1 or death from any cause. PD was at least 20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions with reference being smallest sum on study and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm,or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions,or 1 or more new lesions.If participant does not have complete baseline disease assessment,PFS time censored at date of randomization,regardless of whether or not objectively determined disease progression or death observed for participant.If participant was not known to have died or have objective progression as of data inclusion cutoff date for analysis,the PFS time censored at last adequate tumor assessment date.The use of new anticancer therapy prior to occurrence of PD resulted in censoring at the date of last radiographic assessment prior to initiation of new therapy., From Date of Randomization to Measured Progressive Disease or Death Due to Any Cause (Up to 18 Months)|Overall Survival (OS), OS defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause. Participants who are alive at the time of study completion or are lost to follow-up will be censored at the time they were last known to be alive., From Date of Randomization until Death Due to Any Cause (Up to 18 Months)|Percentage of Participants Who Achieve Best Overall Disease Response of Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR) or Stable Disease (SD) (Disease Control Rate [DCR]), Disease Control Rate (DCR) was the percentage of participants with a best overall response of CR, PR, or Stable Disease (SD) as per Response using RECIST v1.1 criteria. CR defined as the disappearance of all target and nontarget lesions and no appearance of new lesions. PR defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline sum LD), no progression of non-target lesions, and no appearance of new lesions. SD was neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD for target lesions, no progression of non-target lesions, and no appearance of new lesions. PD was at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, with reference being the smallest sum on study and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm, or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, or 1 or more new lesions., From Date of Randomization to Objective Disease Progression or Start of New Anticancer Therapy (Up to 18 Months)|Pharmacokinetics (PK): Minimum Concentration (Cmin) of Necitumumab, Nab-Paclitaxel, and Carboplatin, The Cmin is the minimum observed serum/plasma concentration of Necitumumab, Nab-Paclitaxel, and Carboplatin., Cycle 3 and cycle 4: predose|PK: Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of Necitumumab, Nab-Paclitaxel, and Carboplatin, The Cmax is the maximum observed serum/plasma concentration of Necitumumab, Nab-Paclitaxel, and Carboplatin., Cycle 1, 3 and 4: predose and <15minutes (min) post end-of-infusion|Immunogenicity: Number of Participants Developing Anti-drug Antibodies to Necitumumab, A participant was considered to have an anti-drug antibody response if anti-drug antibodies (ADA) were detected at any time point., Predose Cycle 1 Through Short Term Follow Up (Up To 18 Months)
