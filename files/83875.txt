Optimization of Treatment Strategy for Unresectable cN3 Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
This study aims to investigate a comprehensive therapeutic approach for patients with unresectable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, clinically staged as Tany, N3, M0, and who are not candidate for concurrent chemoradiotherapy combined with immunotherapy. The approach entails combining chemotherapy with immune therapy, followed by synchronized radiotherapy during the immune maintenance phase. The primary goal is to mitigate treatment-related side effects and enhance the overall prognosis through the integration of these treatment modalities.
Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Tirelizumab|DRUG: Nab paclitaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin|RADIATION: Radiotherapy
1-year progression-free survival, From the initial administration of the study drug to the first identification of disease progression or mortality, whichever happens first. In the case of patients who had not encountered local control failure or death, specifically in terms of progression-free survival, the time of the last tumor assessment was considered as the endpoint. Tumor response was evaluated by investigators following RECIST v1.1 criteria., 1 year
Acute toxicity, Monitor the occurrence of acute toxic reactions (based on CTCAE4.03) and subacute toxic reactions (RTOG) in the treatment of cN3 ESCC with the combination of chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and ongoing radiotherapy, both during the treatment course and within three months after its completion., 3 months|Quality of Life (QoL), Collect QoL data on cN3 ESCC patients. The data is measured by EORTC QLQ-C30 (Version 3.0) according to investigator collection at the starting and ending time of the treatment. EORTC QLQ-C30 is a questionnaire developed to assess the quality of life of cancer patients. The core and disease-specific for ESCC modules are selected to estimate treatment related influence on patients' life. The final score of the questionnaire is collected and analyzed according to detailed scoring procedures from manuals., 1 years|Objective response rate, Defined as the proportion of patients with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), 1 year|Duration of response, Defined as the period from the recognition of an objective response to the first identification of either progression or death, whichever event transpired first., 1 year|Disease control rate, Defined as the proportion of patients with complete response (CR), partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD), 1 year|Immune Progression Free Survival, defined as the duration from the initial dose of tislelizumab to the first identification of either disease progression or death, whichever happens first. Tumor response was evaluated by investigators following iRECIST criteria., 1 year|Overall survival, defined as the period from the initial drug administration to the subject's demise from various causes. In cases where patients were lost to follow-up prior to their passing, the date of their last documented contact was documented. For patients still alive at the last analyzed time point, the time of their last contact was considered as their survival duration. In the analysis of survival and subsequent treatment, all patients were monitored until their death, loss to follow-up, or the conclusion of the study., 1 year
Eligible ESCC patients receive a four-cycle regimen of combined chemotherapy plus immunotherapy. Those without disease progression then get definitive radiotherapy with immune maintenance therapy for up to 12 months.
