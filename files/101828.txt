SOTO: Treatment Sensitivity of Organoids to Predict Treatment Outcome
In this study, we aim to assess whether Patient Derived Organoids can be used to predict treatment sensitivity in HNSCC patients.
Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma|Head and Neck Cancer
Successful Organoids, To assess the percentage of successful generated organoids from tissues in head and neck cancer patients, 1 Year
Sensitivity, To assess the sensitivity of radiotherapy, platinum (cisplatin and/or carboplatin) chemotherapy or cetuximab or their combination in PDOs, 1 Year|Treatment Outcome, To correlate the treatment sensitivities of PDOs with the treatment outcome of patients, 1 Year
Treatment Sensitivities, To correlate the treatment sensitivities of PDOs with the detection rates of plasma ctDNA (all cohorts), 1 Year|Patients Features, To assess and correlate the histopathological, genomic and transcriptomic features of patients' samples with PDOs, 1 Year|PDOs Sensitivities, To assess the sensitivities of PDOs to various targeted therapies based on their genomic profiles, 1 Year|Translational Research, Collection of archival tissues, blood samples (for ctDNA and PBMC), saliva (for ctDNA), urine or stool samples for other translational research, 1 Year
This is a prospective observation study to generate patient-derived organoids from patients' samples to assess treatment response and to correlate with patients' treatment outcomes and to collect preliminary data on the ability of PDOs to predict patients' treatment response and whether their radiosensitivity and chemosensitivity can be correlated with their survival outcome.
