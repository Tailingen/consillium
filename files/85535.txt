An Efficacy and Safety Study for Yondelis (Trabectedin) in Patients With Advanced Relapsed Ovarian Cancer
The purpose of the study is to compare the progression-free survival (PFS) of the combination of trabectedin + DOXIL with DOXIL monotherapy in patients with ovarian cancer.
Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: Trabectedin|DRUG: DOXIL|DRUG: Dexamethasone
Progression-Free Survival (PFS): Independent Radiologist Review, PFS is defined as the time between randomization and disease progression or death., From the date of randomization until the date of disease progression or death, as assessed for approximately 3 years
Overall Survival, Overall survival was defined as the time between the randomization and death, From the date of randomization until the date of death, as assessed for approximately 3 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR) - Independent Radiologist Review, Percentage of participants who achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as best overall response. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR) = Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR)= greater than or equal to 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions and Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., From the date of randomization until the date of disease progression or death, as assessed for approximately 3 years|Duration of Response: Independent Radiologist Review, Duration of response was defined only for participants who had complete response or partial response as best overall response. Duration of response was calculated from the date of first documentation of response (not the confirmation) to the date of disease progression or death due to progressive disease., From the date of first documentation of response to the date of disease progression or death due to progressive disease, as assessed for approximately 3 years|Median Area Under Curve (AUC) of Trabectedin., Median simulated area under the curve (AUC) of a 21 day trabectedin profile of participants (of this study) administering trabectedin and doxil, calculated using the trapezoidal rule method. Simulations were based on a dataset created of 1000 participants using the posthoc parameter estimations, derived from the population pharmacokinetic analysis dataset of Trabectedin (Participants=831, with resampling). Plasma concentration-time profiles were simulated up to 504 hour post-dosing using a rich sampling., Day 1 (Predose; 1.5 hour after start of infusion; 5 minutes, 2 hour and 6 to 20 hour after end of infusion); Day 8 (168 hour after end of infusion); and Day 15 (336 hour after end of infusion) at Cycles 1 and 2|Median Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of Trabectedin., Median simulated maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) at 3 hour of a 21 day trabectedin profile of participants (of this study) administering trabectedin and doxil. The assessment of Cmax was based on a dataset created of 1000 participants using the posthoc parameter estimations, derived from the population pharmacokinetic analysis dataset of Trabectedin (participants=831, with resampling). Plasma concentration-time profiles were simulated up to 504 hour post-dosing using a rich sampling., Day 1 (Predose; 1.5 hour after start of infusion; 5 minutes, 2 hour and 6 to 20 hour after end of infusion); Day 8 (168 hour after end of infusion); and Day 15 (336 hour after end of infusion) at Cycles 1 and 2
This is a multicenter, open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), randomized (study medication is assigned by chance), Phase 3 study comparing the combination of trabectedin + DOXIL with DOXIL monotherapy in patients with advanced ovarian cancer (who were previously treated and for whom first-line platinum-based chemotherapy regimen has failed). Approximately 650 patients will be randomly assigned to 1 of the treatment arms (DOXIL and DOXIL + trabectedin) over 2 years. At the time of randomization, patients will be stratified on the basis of platinum sensitivity of disease (sensitive or resistant) and baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score (0 to 1 or 2. Safety will be evaluated on the basis of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, physical examination, vital signs assessment and cardiovascular safety assessment. An interim analysis of overall survival will be performed in conjunction with progression-free survival analysis during the study. Treatment will be continued until disease progression occurred or until patients experienced a confirmed complete response for at least 2 cycles. Continuation of treatment in select individual patients beyond this study end date will be allowed if the investigator determined that the patient is benefiting from treatment, is eligible to receive further therapy, and consents to treatment. If disease progression has not occurred at treatment termination, then disease assessment will continue every 8 weeks until there is evidence of disease progression or death, or until the clinical data cutoff date, or until the start of first subsequent anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier.
