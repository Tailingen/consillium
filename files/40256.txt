RALPPS Venus ALPPS for Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Currently，the "ALPPS" (associating liver partition with portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy) procedure which enables the rapid growth of the future liver remnant and extends surgical indication to patients with mid-advanced stage hepatocellular carcinoma becomes a research hot spot. However, the procedure has a high morbidity and mortality rate.Using radio-frequency ablation instead of in-situ split of liver to avoid forming a coagulation band in stage I will reduce the incidence of complications（bile leakage, abdominal infection,hemorrhage e.t.) The investigators named this technique as Radio-frequency Assisted Liver Partition with Portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy （RALPPS）.Investigators hypothesized that the RALPPS might result in lower morbidity and mortality rate than ALPPS in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma . This Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial is on the Safety and Efficacy of radio-frequency assisted liver partition with portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma.
