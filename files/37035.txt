Molecularly Tailored Therapy for Patients With Metastatic Cancer of the Esophagus and Stomach
The purpose of this study is to determine whether molecular profile-directed therapy (otherwise known as personalized treatment) can improve the effectiveness of standard chemotherapy combinations for patients with esophagogastric adenocarcinoma. A series of tests will be performed on a sample of tumor; based on the results of these tests, a patient will be assigned to a chemotherapy treatment.

The Number of Patients With Tumor Size Reduction (Objective Response Rate), Objective response rate is the sum of partial responses plus complete responses and will be assessed per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by CT: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions., 1 year
