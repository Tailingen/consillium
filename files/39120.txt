The PhOCus Trial: Implementation of Pharmacogenomic Testing in Oncology Care
Doctors leading this study hope to find out if giving study participants' genetic information to cancer care providers will help personalize chemotherapy dosing decisions and decrease common chemotherapy side effects. Doctors leading the study will collect genetic information from study participants using pharmacogenomics/genotyping. Pharmacogenomics is the study of how the differences in our genes can affect our unique response to medications.

This is a randomized study, which means that participants in this study will be randomly assigned (as if "by flip of a coin") to one of two different groups: a "pharmacogenomics group" or "control group".
Gastrointestinal Cancer|Head and Neck Cancer|Dihydropyrimidine Dehydrogenase Deficiency|UGT1A1 Gene Mutation|Breast Cancer
OTHER: Availability of clinical decision support based on pharmacogenomic results.
Dose Deviation Rate (Co-Primary Endpoint), To assess the impact of prospective pharmacogenomic testing on dose intensity deviation rate of chemotherapy during the 1st treatment cycle, comparing control vs. pharmacogenomics-guided arms., 15 months|Grade 3 or Higher Toxicity (Co-Primary Endpoint), To determine the degree to which providing oncologists with comprehensive pharmacogenomic information impacts the incidence of Grade 3 or worse toxicities in subjects receiving chemotherapy. Toxicities will be assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5., 5 years
Cumulative Chemotherapy Dose Intensity, Cumulative drug dose intensity received (function of dose and frequency of drug administration)., 5 years.|Response Rate, Anti-cancer tumor response based on radiographic assessment (complete response, partial response, stable disease, progressive disease), by tumor type and disease setting., 5 years.|Progression free survival (PFS), Progression free survival (PFS) by tumor type and disease setting., 5 years|Overall Survival, Overall survival (OS) by tumor type and disease setting., 5 years
