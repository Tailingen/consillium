Human Papillomavirus and Rate of Pregnancy Achieved Via Medically Assisted Procreation
The main objective of this study is to investigate the association between the presence of HPV infection in one or both members of infertile/sub-infertile couples and the outcome of pregnancies obtained by assisted reproduction.

The success of assisted medical procreation is defined as achieving a pregnancy resulting in the birth of a living, viable child.
Infertility|Sub-fertility|Papillomavirus Infections
HPV test for participating women (cervicovaginal sample): positive/negative, baseline (day 0)|HPV test for participating men (sperm sample): positive/negative, baseline (day 0)|Birth of a living, viable child (yes/no), end of pregnancy (expected maximum of 9 months)|type of medically assisted procreation used, baseline (day 0)
HPV genotypes found, baseline (day 0)|Description of spermogram anomalies, baseline (day 0)|Embryo score according to Giorgetti et al 1995, Embryo transfer (baseline, day 0)|Blastocyte score according to Gardner & Schoolcraft 1999, Embryo transfer (baseline, day 0)|Percentage of implantable embryos, Baseline (day 0)|BHCG test, Beta HCG - Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (pregnancy test), Days 13 to 15 after embryo transfer|Pregnancy confirmed via ultrasound, yes/no, 5 weeks|Pregnancy confirmed via ultrasound, yes/no, 12 weeks|Spontaneous miscarriage before 3 months, yes/no, 3 months|Spontaneous miscarriage after 3 months, yes/no, end of pregnancy (expected maximum of 9 months)|Spontaneous miscarriage, yes/no, end of pregnancy (expected maximum of 9 months)|Histological and HPV testing on miscarriage samplings, end of pregnancy (expected maximum of 9 months)|Days of gestation, end of pregnancy (expected maximum of 9 months)|Appearance of fetal malformations (yes/no), end of pregnancy (expected maximum of 9 months)|HPV testing on placenta (positive/negative + genotype), end of pregnancy (expected maximum of 9 months)|Schieve classification according to weeks of gestation and weight of baby, end of pregnancy (expected maximum of 9 months)|weight of baby at birth / days of gestation (g/day), end of pregnancy (expected maximum of 9 months)
The secondary objectives of this study are:

A. To study the alterations of sperm present in infertile men according to the presence of HPV in semen.

B. Identify the specific HPV genotypes involved.

C. To study a potential link between HPV and embryonic characteristics (as classified by Giorgetti)

D. To study a potential link between HPV and survival of the conceptus: products of miscarriage or stillbirth, duration of pregnancy, birth weight.

E. To study a potential link between HPV and fetal malformations.
