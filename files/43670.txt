Phase I/IIa Dose Finding Study of Triplet Regimen of Relatlimab Ipilimumab and NIvolumab in First Line Therapy of Metastatic Melanoma (TRINITY)
To determine the recommended Phase IIa dose (RP2D) of the triplet combination.

To determine the safety and efficacy of the combination at the RP2D.
Melanoma
DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: Relatlimab|DRUG: Ipilimumab
Safety and Adverse Events (AEs), Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, Through study completion; an average of 1 year
Primary Objectives:

Phase I:

Primary Objective of the Phase I portion is to determine the recommended Phase IIa dose (RP2D) of ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab and relatlimab in the first line treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma.

Phase IIa:

Primary Objective of the Phase IIa portion is to determine the preliminary clinical efficacy of ipilimumab at the RP2D in combination with nivolumab and relatlimab in the first line treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma as determined by overall response rate (ORR) according to RECIST 1.1.

Secondary Objectives:

1. Phase I: To assess the overall response rates by RECIST 1.1 (as assessed by Investigator/site designated radiologist).
2. Phase IIa: To determine the safety and tolerability of the triplet combination.
3. To assess the progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival for patients treated with the triplet combination
4. Assess the PFS and ORR to subsequent therapies in the second and third line setting.
5. Evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects of the combination in tumor tissues obtained at baseline (archival and/or fresh tissue), on treatment, and at time of progression.
6. Peripheral blood assays to assess for immunologic changes and immune cell subsets
