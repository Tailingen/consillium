Proton Therapy for Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer
The purpose of this protocol is to determine toxicity and efficacy of proton therapy in combination with standard concomitant platinum-based chemotherapy and standard image-guided adaptive brachytherapy (IGABT) in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC). The over-all aim is to maintain a high disease control and at the same time reduce acute morbidity as well as late side effects after treatment.
