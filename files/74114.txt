Understanding the Implementation of Cued Exercise Using Wearable Devices and a Custom Smartphone Application Following Bone Marrow Transplant.
The purpose of this study is to pilot test the feasibility of providing patients diagnosed with a hematologic malignancy, undergoing an allogeneic bone marrow transplant, a wearable device and smartphone app (similar to a Fitbit), that would send personalized reminders to move during their post-transplant inpatient hospital stay to promote physical recovery and well-being.
Blood Cancer|Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT)
BEHAVIORAL: exercise intervention
Pilot evaluation of intervention efficacy, Efficacy will be evaluated by examining the percentage of time participants responded to the cued exercise prompts., cumulative percent from day 1 through discharge from hospital, on average day 30|Patient feedback from participation in the study, Patient experience will be evaluated by looking at the central tendencies of the ratings from the post-participation evaluation survey., day 10
Enrolled patients who have been diagnosed with a hematologic malignancy and are scheduled to undergo an allogeneic bone marrow transplant will use a custom-designed wearable device and smartphone application as a behavioral intervention to cue exercise. Participants will be asked to wear the wearable device for the duration of their post-transplant inpatient hospital stay.

Aim 1. To examine the potential efficacy of the wearable device + smartphone application to prompt alloBMT patients to move.

Aim 2. To receive participant feedback on their experience participating in the study.
