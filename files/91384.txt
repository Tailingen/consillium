Low-Dose Azacitidine, Lenalidomide, and Low-Dose Dexamethasone in Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as azacitidine and dexamethasone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Biological therapies, such as lenalidomide, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Giving azacitidine together with lenalidomide and dexamethasone may kill more cancer cells.

PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of azacitidine when given together with lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone in treating patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.
Refractory Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: azacitidine|DRUG: lenalidomide|DRUG: dexamethasone|OTHER: DNA methylation analysis|OTHER: gene expression analysis|OTHER: bone marrow aspiration|OTHER: immunohistochemistry staining method|OTHER: reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction|OTHER: flow cytometry
Phase I: Highest Tolerated Low Dose (HTLD), Azacitidine given at low but increasing doses up to 50mg/m2 twice a week. Maximum tolerated dose reported., During the first 28-day cycle
Percent of Participants With Clinical Benefit and Response According to International Response Criteria, Percent of participants with response according to international response criteria (\>= PR) and percent of participants with clinical benefit response (\>= minor response according to adapted EBMT criteria). Determined with serum and 24 hour urine protein electrophoresis, and as appropriate, supplemented by immunofixation, serum free light chain assay, and bone marrow examination. Response before high dose melphalan and autologous stem cell transplant will also be confirmed by two separate blood and 24 hour urine tests between the last dose of combination therapy and the first dose of the mobilizing agent., at 6 months|Percent of Participants With Clinical Benefit and Response According to International Response Criteria, Percent of participants with response according to international response criteria (\>= PR) and percent of participants with clinical benefit response (\>= minor response according to adapted EBMT criteria). Determined with serum and 24 hour urine protein electrophoresis, and as appropriate, supplemented by immunofixation, serum free light chain assay, and bone marrow examination. Response before high dose melphalan and autologous stem cell transplant will also be confirmed by two separate blood and 24 hour urine tests between the last dose of combination therapy and the first dose of the mobilizing agent., at 12 months|Median Progression-free Survival (PFS), Median PFS, measured in months from study entry to progression as defined by international response criteria or death of any cause, whichever comes first, Up to 3 years|Overall Survival, Overall survival will be measured from study entry to death from any cause - median months survival will be reported, up to 3 years
Changes in Global Gene Expression, The RNA harvested from myeloma cells before and after the first cycle of therapy at the HTLD level will furthermore be used to identify changes in global gene expression using the Illumina® HT12 array., before and after the first cycle of therapy|Quantify the Activity of Azacitidine Inactivating Enzyme Cytidine Deaminase (CDA), Plasma from peripheral blood draws will be used to quantify the activity of CDA using an HPLC method.The enzymatic activity is determined by comparison of cytidine deamination achieved by plasma samples with deamination achieved by incubation of cytidine with dilutions of pure CDA enzyme standards., at 6 months|Promoter Demethylation and Gene Reactivation, Promoter demethylation and gene reactivation will be measured at least at the HTLD level using the Illumina® HumanMethylation27 BeadChip array on CD138 purified and CD34 purified cells obtained from bone marrow aspirates, within 7 days before treatment start and at the end of cycle #1|CD34+ Cell Yield and Time to Neutrophil and Platelet Recovery, CD34+ cell yield will be calculated based on flow cytometry of mononuclear cells harvested following stem cell mobilization. Time to neutrophil (\> 1,000/mm3) and platelet (\> 100,000/mm3) recovery will be counted from the day of stem cell infusion (=day 0), after cycle 1 (28 days)
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

Define the highest tolerated low dose (HTLD) and safety of azacitidine given at low but increasing doses up to 50mg/m2 twice a week concurrently with Glomerular filtration rate (GFR)-adjusted lenalidomide and low dose dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

* Response according to international response criteria (≥PR) and clinical benefit response (≥minor response according to adapted EBMT criteria)
* Correlate response with plasma activity of the azacitidine inactivating enzyme cytidine deaminase (CDA)
* Progression-free survival and overall survival
* Peripheral blood hematopoietic progenitor (CD34+) yield and time to neutrophil and platelet recovery in patients undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation
* Promoter demethylation and gene reactivation in myeloma cells and hematopoietic progenitors treated at the HTLD / HTLD-CKD level after cycle 1
* Changes in global gene expression in myeloma cells treated at the HTLD / HTLD-CKD level after cycle 1

OUTLINE:

This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of azacitidine followed by a phase II study.

Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously once or twice weekly and oral dexamethasone once weekly starting on day 1. Patients also receive oral lenalidomide once daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses. Patients then continue to receive lenalidomide as maintenance therapy. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 3 years.
