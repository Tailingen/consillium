Pilot Study of Anti-oxidant Supplementation With N-Acetyl Cysteine in Stage 0/I Breast Cancer
NAC is the N-acetyl derivative of the naturally occurring amino acid, L-cysteine. It is a common over-the-counter supplement and also is available as an injectable pharmaceutical that protects the liver in cases of acetaminophen overdose. In the exercise physiology literature, both oral and injectable NAC have been shown to reduce fatigue and improve recovery from exertion which has interesting implications for exploring cancer-related fatigue.

In terms of cancer cell biology, reactive oxygen species (ROS) may play an important role in the development and progression of breast cancer
Stage 0/1 Breast Cancer|Post Biopsy|Pre-surgery
DRUG: IV/oral n-acetylcysteine
Efficacy, To assess the feasibility of evaluating the effect of n-acetylcysteine on tumor cell metabolism by assessing the changes in expression of caveolin -1 and MCT4 in cancer associated fibroblasts in pre and post therapy breast tissue treated with NAC., 2-4 weeks
Safety, To confirm the safety of combined oral and IV NAC in patients with breast cancer. This will be evaluated by the number of participants with adeverse events and Grade 3/4 toxicities according to CTCAE v3.0, 2-4 weeks|2. To access the changes in HIF-1 alpha and p65 subunit of NFB in tumor stroma in pre and post therapy breast tissue treated with NAC, To access the changes in HIF-1 alpha and p65 subunit of NFB in tumor stroma in pre and post therapy breast tissue treated with NAC, 2-4 weeks|To evaluate potential effects of NAC on quality of life and fatigue, To evaluate potential effects of NAC on quality of life and fatigue using the FACT-G, Brief Fatigue Inventory, and PROMIS quality assessment instruments., 2-4 weeks
