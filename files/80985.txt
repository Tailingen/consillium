Deep Learning Using Chest X-Rays to Identify High Risk Patients for Lung Cancer Screening CT
The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate whether an AI tool that alerts providers to patients at high 6-year risk of lung cancer based on their chest x-ray images will improve lung cancer screening CT participation. The main question it aims to answer is: Does the AI tool improve lung cancer screening CT participation at 6 months after the baseline outpatient visit

The intervention is an alert to the provider to discuss lung cancer screening CT eligibility, for patients considered at high risk of lung cancer based on CXR-LC AI tool.

If there is a comparison group: Researchers will compare intervention and non-intervention arms to determine if lung cancer screen CT participation increases.
