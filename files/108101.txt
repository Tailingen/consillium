Irreversible Electroporation Ablation for Colorectal Metastases to the Lung
The investigators are investigating the use of a new cancer treatment called Irreversible Electroporation (IRE). This treatment delivers electrical energy between two needles placed in a cancer. The electrical energy causes cells to die. While this has been used in patients for different applications, the investigators are trying to understand how safe and well it works in colon cancer that has spread to the lung. Once the irreversible electroporation procedure is completed during the operation, the surgeon will then remove the cancer according to standard procedure. As part of the study, they will be measuring safety of the electrical energy delivered and will be reviewing the resected specimen under the microscope.
Colorectal Metastases to the Lung
DEVICE: Irreversible Electroporation Ablation
The Frequency of Adverse Events, Safety will be measured by using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.0). The goal of this study is to establish safety.

If there are 3 or more grade 3 or higher device related AEs, then we will stop the study., 2 years
