A Study of ZEN003694 in People With Squamous Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to find out whether ZEN003694 is an effective treatment for people with advanced squamous cell lung cancer with a mutation in the NSD3 gene.

ZEN003694 is a type of drug called a BET inhibitor. Researchers think ZEN003694 may help here because the drug works by blocking a group of proteins called bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) proteins, which may counteract the effect of NSD3 on tumor growth. Blocking these proteins may slow or stop the growth of the cancer.
Squamous Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: ZEN003694
overall response rate (ORR), Response to ZEN003694 will be determined using the sum unidimensional measurements of the target lesions present on the scan. Unidimensional measurement rules will adhere to RECIST 1.1 guidelines.(6) Classification of response will be categorized by RECIST 1.1 (CR, PR, SD, PD)., 2 years
