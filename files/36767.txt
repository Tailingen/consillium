A Study to Find a Safe Dose of Volasertib Given in Addition to Standard Salvage Chemotherapy in Children (Age 3 Months to Less Than 18 Years) With Acute Myeloid Leukaemia, in Whom Front-line Chemotherapy Failed
This is an open-label, dose-escalating trial to evaluate the MTD and/or dose to be used for further development by evaluation of DLT in course 1 and the safety of volasertib when added to standard intensive salvage chemotherapy with DNX-FLA in paediatric patients with AML after failure of first-line therapy. Furthermore, data on efficacy and PK/PD of volasertib in paediatric patients with AML when added to standard intensive salvage chemotherapy will be collected.
