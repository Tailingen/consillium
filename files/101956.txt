KN046 (a Humanized PD-L1/CTLA4 Bispecific Single Domain Fc Fusion Protein Antibody) in Subjects With Thymic Carcinoma
This is a Phase 2, open-label, multi-center, single arm study in subjects with advanced thymic carcinoma after failure of platinum-based combination chemotherapy. Subjects should have documented progressive disease while on platinum-based combination chemotherapy. If subjects discontinued platinum-based therapy due to reasons other than progressive disease, subjects should have completed at least 2 cycles of platinum-based combination chemotherapy before the commencement of documented progressive disease. Subjects will be treated with KN046 5 milligram per kilogram every 2 weeks.
