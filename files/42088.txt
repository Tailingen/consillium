A Study of Amivantamab and Capmatinib Combination Therapy in Unresectable Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to identify the recommended Phase 2 combination dose (RP2CD\[s\]) of the amivantamab and capmatinib combination therapy in participants with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in Phase 1 (combination dose selection), and to evaluate the antitumor effect of the amivantamab and capmatinib combination therapy in mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) exon 14 skipping mutation and MET amplified NSCLC, when administered at the selected RP2CD(s) in Phase 2 (expansion).
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
DRUG: Capmatinib|DRUG: Amivantamab
Phase 1: Number of Participants with Adverse events (AEs) by Severity, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a pharmaceutical (investigational or non-investigational) product. An adverse event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the intervention. Severity will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 5.0. Severity scale ranges from Grade 1 (Mild) to Grade 5 (Death). Grade 1= Mild, Grade 2= Moderate, Grade 3= Severe, Grade 4= Life-threatening and Grade 5= Death related to adverse event., Up to 2 years 1 month|Phase 1: Number of Participants with Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), The DLTs are specific adverse events and are defined as any of the following: high grade non-hematologic toxicity, hematologic toxicity, pulmonary toxicity, liver enzyme elevation, or treatment delay greater than (\>) 28 days due to unresolved toxicity., Cycle 1 (Day 1 through Day 28)|Phase 2: Objective Response Rate, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve either a confirmed partial response (PR) or complete response (CR), using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1., Up to 2 years 1 month

Grade 1= Mild, Grade 2= Moderate, Grade 3= Severe, Grade 4= Life-threatening and Grade 5= Death related to adverse event., Up to 2 years 1 month|Phase 1: Number of Participants with Abnormalities in Clinical Laboratory Parameters, Number of participants with abnormalities in clinical laboratory parameters (serum chemistry, hematology, coagulation, serology, and urinalysis) will be reported., Up to 2 years 1 month|Phase 2: Duration of Response (DoR), DoR is defined as the time from the date of first documented response (PR or CR) until the date of documented progression or death from any case, whichever comes first, for participants who have PR or CR., Up to 2 years 1 month|Phase 2: Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve a PR, CR, or stable disease using RECIST version 1.1., Up to 2 years 1 month|Phase 2: Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from first dose date until the date of disease progression or death, whichever comes first, based on investigator assessment using RECIST version 1.1, Up to 2 years 1 month|Phase 2: Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of administration of the first study treatment until the date of death due to any cause., Up to 2 years 1 month|Phase 2: Time to Subsequent Therapy (TTST), TTST is defined as the time from the date of administration of the first study treatment to the start date of the subsequent anticancer therapy following study treatment discontinuation, or death, whichever comes first., Up to 2 years 1 month|Phase 2 (Cohort 1A): Change from Baseline in Health-related Quality of Life in (HRQoL) as Assessed by European Organization of Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC-QLQ-C30) Scale Score, EORTC-QLQ-C30 is a self-administered, 30-item questionnaire developed to assess the HRQoL of cancer participants., Baseline up to 2 years 1 month|Phase 2 (Cohort 1A): HRQoL as Assessed by Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer - Symptom Assessment Questionnaire (NSCLC-SAQ) Scale Score, NSCLC-SAQ assesses patient-reported symptom severity associated with NSCLC., Up to 2 years 1 month|Phase 2 (Cohort 1A): HRQoL as Assessed by EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L) Scale Score, EQ-5D-5L is a self-administered, standardized measure of health status., Up to 2 years 1 month|Phase 2 (Cohort 1A): HRQoL as Assessed by Patient-reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Short Form Version 2.0 - Physical Function 8c (PROMIS PF 8c) Scale Score, PROMIS PF 8c is an 8-item fixed length short form derived from the PROMIS Physical Function item bank. It assesses activities of daily living, mobility, and global impact of physical functioning., Up to 2 years 1 month
