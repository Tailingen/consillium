A Study In Patients With Advanced Solid Tumor
This study designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of AG-013736 at single doses and multiple doses
Neoplasms
DRUG: Axitinib (AG-013736)
Single Dose: Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Predose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 24, and 32-hour postdose|Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve From Time Zero to Time Infinity (AUCinf), AUCinf is obtained from AUC (0 - t) plus AUC (t - infinity)., Predose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 24, and 32-hour postdose|Single Dose: Time to Reach Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Tmax), Predose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 24, and 32-hour postdose|Single Dose: Plasma Decay Half-Life (t1/2), Plasma decay half-life is the time measured for the plasma concentration to decrease by one half., Predose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 24, and 32-hour postdose
Multiple Dose: Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Cmax at multiple dosing, Cycle 1 Day 15 predose in the morning, and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 hour postdose|Multiple Dose: Area Under the Curve From Time Zero to End of Dosing Interval (AUCtau), The dosing interval was 12 hours in this study., Cycle 1 Day 15 predose in the morning, and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 hour postdose|Multiple Dose: Time to Reach Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Tmax), Tmax at multiple dosing, Cycle 1 Day 15 predose in the morning, and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 hour postdose|Multiple Dose: Accumulation Ratio for Cmax (Rac Cmax) and Accumulation Ratio for AUCtau (Rac AUCtau), Rac Cmax is obtained from Cmax (Cycle 1, Day 15) divided by Cmax (Cycle 1, Day 1) Rac AUCtau is obtained from AUCtau (Cycle 1, Day 15) divided by AUCtau (Cycle 1, Day 1), Cycle 1 Day 15 predose in the morning, and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 hour postdose|Percent Change From Baseline in Soluble Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 1, 2, and 3 (s-VEGFR1, s-VEGFR2 and s-VEGFR3), Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), Soluble Stem Cell Factor Receptor (s-KIT ), Percent change from baseline is obtained from (observed value minus baseline value) divided by baseline value multiplied by 100 in each parameter, i.e., s-VEGFR1, VEGFR2, s-VEGFR3, s-KIT, and VEGF, Prior to the initial dose (baseline) and Day 1 of Cycle 2|Number of Participants With Best Overall Response of Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), Stable Disease (SD), and Progression of Disease (PD) According to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST Version 1.0), CR was defined as the disappearance of all target and nontarget lesions and no appearance of new lesions. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters (SLD) of the targeted lesions. CR and PR had to be documented on 2 occasions separated by at least 4 weeks. SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify as PD being demonstrated during the first 8 weeks. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the SLD of target lesions compared to the smallest SLD since the study treatment started., Up to 470 days|Number of Participants With Adverse Events, Number of participants with any adverse events, adverse events graded as Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 3.0 Grade 3 or higher , serious adverse events, and adverse events resulted in discontinuation., Up to 470 days of treatment plus 28-days follow-up
