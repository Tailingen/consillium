Frameless Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Brain Metastases
The investigators plan to study high dose, single treatment radiation, using a plastic mask instead of a head frame that pins into a patient's skull. The investigators need to (1) quantify set-up accuracy and patient motion during radiation treatment and (2) ensure that without the head frame the tumour control rate and risk of complications are similar to our previous experience using the head frame.
