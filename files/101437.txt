Objective Response Rate, Tumor assessments were evaluated at baseline by computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The primary objective of this study was to determine the overall objective response rate (ORR) per investigator assessment, defined as confirmed complete response (CR; disappearance of all target lesions) + partial response (PR; at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions) by RECIST v1.1, for seribantumab monotherapy (3,000 mg QW) in patients with centrally confirmed NRG1 fusion., Up to 12 months
