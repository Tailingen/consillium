Treatment of Relapsed and/or Chemotherapy Refractory Advanced Malignancies by CART-meso
RATIONALE: Placing a tumor antigen chimeric receptor that has been created in the laboratory into patient autologous or donor-derived T cells may make the body build immune response to kill cancer cells.

PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying genetically engineered lymphocyte therapy in treating patients with Relapsed and/or Chemotherapy Refractory Advanced Malignancies.
Malignant Mesothelioma|Pancreatic Cancer|Ovarian Tumor|Triple Negative Breast Cancer|Endometrial Cancer|Other Mesothelin Positive Tumors
BIOLOGICAL: anti-meso-CAR vector transduced T cells
Occurrence of Study related adverse events, defined as \>= Grade 3 signs/symptoms, laboratory toxicities, and clinical, Until week 24
Anti-tumor responses to CART-meso cell infusions, up to 24 weeks
In vivo existence of CART-meso, 1 year
I. Determine the safety and feasibility of the chimeric antigen receptor T cells transduced with the anti-meso vector (referred to as CART-meso cells).

II. Determine duration of in vivo survival of CART-meso cells. RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) analysis of whole blood will be used to detect and quantify survival of CART-meso TCR (T-cell receptor) zeta:CD137 over time.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. For patients with detectable disease, measure anti-tumor response due to CART-meso cell infusions.

II. Estimate relative trafficking of CART-meso cells to tumor in bone marrow and lymph nodes.

III. For patients with stored or accessible tumor cells determine tumor cell killing by CART-meso cells in vitro.

IV. Determine if cellular or humoral host immunity develops against the murine anti-meso, and assess correlation with loss of detectable CART-meso (loss of engraftment).

V. Determine the relative subsets of CART-meso T cells (Tcm, Tem, and Treg).
