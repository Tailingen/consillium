Salvage HIFU for Local Recurrence in the Prostatic Bed After Prostatectomy and External Beam Radiation Therapy : Preliminary Results
Retrospective monocentric analysis performed on patients treated with salvage HIFU for isolated macroscopic recurrence in the prostatic bed after radical prostatectomy and salvage or adjuvant EBRT. The oncological outcomes (treatment failure-free survival, progression-free survival), the adverse events and urinary incontinence will be evaluated.

OTHER: Retrospectively review of medical data in patients treated by Salvage HIFU for isolated macroscopic recurrence in the prostatic bed after radical prostatectomy and salvage or adjuvant EBRT
Oncological outcomes in the prostatic bed after S-HIFU for a local recurrence after RP and salvage or adjuvant EBRT., Oncological outcomes:

* Treatment failure-free survival: absence of:

  * recurrent prostate cancer in the prostatic bed and/or
  * metastasis and/or
  * introduction of systemic treatment
* Progression-free survival: absence of:

  * metastasis and/or
  * introduction of systemic treatment
* decrease in PSA value: any drop in PSA after S-HIFU, regardless of whether there was subsequent PSA progression
* BCR-free survival following S-HIFU defined as an absence of two rises in PSA â‰¥0.2 ng/mL above nadir

Functional outcomes:

* complications (Clavien classification)
* Urinary incontinence (Ingelman-Sundberg score), December 31, 2019
