Study of an Experimental New Drug, PPARÎ³ Agonist Taken by Mouth by Participants With Advanced or Metastatic Cancer
An open-label, Phase I, dose escalation study of CS-7017 administered by mouth in sequential cohorts of 3 to 6 participants with advanced or metastatic malignancies.
Neoplasm
DRUG: CS-7017
Best Overall Tumor Response Following Administration of CS-7017 in Participants With Advanced or Metastatic Malignancies, Complete response (CR) was defined as a disappearance of all target lesions, partial response (PR) was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, and stable disease (SD) was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD; at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions). Objective response rate was defined as the sum of all CRs and PRs., Baseline up to at least 2 cycles (each cycle was 3 weeks), up to 2 years 5 months
Summary of Pharmacokinetic Parameter Area Under the Concentration Versus Time Curve of Means of Serum Free Form of CS-7017 (R-150033) Following Administration of CS-7017 in Participants With Advanced or Metastatic Malignancies, Area under the plasma/serum drug concentration-time curve for dosing interval (AUC\[0-tau\]), computed using the linear trapezoidal rule and area under the plasma/serum drug concentration-time curve from 0 to last time point above the quantification limit (AUC\[0-t\]) calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule were assessed., Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 2: predose, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 10 hours postdose; and predose on Day 8 and 15 of Cycle 1.|Summary of Pharmacokinetic Parameter Observed Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of Means of Serum Free Form of CS-7017 (R-150033) Following Administration of CS-7017 in Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Malignancies, Cmax was defined as observed maximum plasma concentration., Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 2: predose, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 10 hours postdose; and predose on Day 8 and 15 of Cycle 1.|Summary of Pharmacokinetic Parameter Terminal Elimination Half-life (t1/2) of Means of Serum Free Form of CS-7017 (R-150033) Following Administration of CS-7017 in Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Malignancies, Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 2: predose, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 10 hours postdose; and predose on Day 8 and 15 of Cycle 1.|Summary of Pharmacokinetic Parameter Time of Maximum Plasma Concentration (Tmax) of Means of Serum Free Form of CS-7017 (R-150033) Following Administration of CS-7017 in Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Malignancies, Tmax was defined as time of maximum plasma concentration., Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 2: predose, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 10 hours postdose; and predose on Day 8 and 15 of Cycle 1.
