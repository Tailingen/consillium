COGNITION: Genomics-Guided Precision Oncology in Early High-Risk Breast Cancer
The COGNITION diagnostic platform elucidates the biomarker profile of neoadjuvant chemotherapy-resistant residual bulk tumors in high risk early breast cancer patients. The major goal is to provide a framework for genomic profiling, which serves as infrastructure for systematic biomarker-screening and -stratification for concise therapy-arm allocation in the interventional clinical phase II trial COGNITION-GUIDE (NCT05332561).

In patients, who display a poor response to standard-of-care neoadjuvant chemotherapy, tissue samples before and after neoadjuvant therapy are subjected together with blood samples to comprehensive genomic profiling to identify patients potentially benefiting from biomarker-guided interventions in COGNITION-GUIDE.

Samples not required for standard-of-care clinical procedures or genomic profiling are systematically collected in a dedicated bio-repository to fuel translational scientific companion programs. The continuously growing comprehensive database serves as an integrative resource for systematic, prospective multidimensional data collection (clinical records, biomaterial, genomic data).

In summary, the overarching goal is to generate a precision oncology platform i) to identify clinically-actionable biomarkers and drug targets that drive genomics-guided therapies and ii) to couple the observational, diagnostic registry platform to the independent, biomarker-stratified clinical therapy trial COGNITION-GUIDE.

* Patient registration and enrolment: pts with histologically confirmed early breast cancer and indication for neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT, any subtype) who give their consent for the integrative genomic profiling study as pre-requisite for molecular stratification in the coupled phase II COGNITION-GUIDE (NCT05332561) therapy trial.
* Collection of biomaterial: Fresh-frozen tumor tissue from primary breast tumors is collected during routine procedures at study entry (T1: baseline-treatment naive) and from residual bulk tumors (T2: w/o pCR after NACT). To account for germline alterations (genomic control) and to fuel companion programs, consecutive blood samples are taken at baseline (V1) and after NACT (V2).
* Processing and analyses of patient samples: Biomaterials are centrally processed (standard histology/IHC and pathology review for tumor content; analyte extraction, QC according to standardized, quality-controlled, accredited workflows. Molecular profiling \& clinical bioinformatics: Genomic profiling encompasses Whole-Genome on fresh-frozen tissue biopsies or Whole-Exome on FFPE surgical specimens (if fresh-frozen tissue has insufficient tumor cell content \>20%). Both options are complemented by RNA-Seq facilitating an unbiased integrated view on the expression of multiple biomarkers.
* Clinical curation and data interpretation: Based on the curative intent, a rigorous, pre-defined biomarker algorithm (strong and soft biomarkers) is applied. This strategy allows assessment whether the tumor profile qualifies for one of the molecular-guided treatment arms.
* Molecular Tumor Board (MTB): Molecular data are interpreted by clinicians, bioinformaticians, molecular biologists, human geneticists and pathologists in a weekly interdisciplinary MTB established at NCT. Treatment-relevant biomarkers and actionable drug targets are validated independently. Disease-relevant germline alterations will lead to genetic counselling.
* Treatment recommendations and therapy implementation: Conclusive biomarker profiles from clinical, histopathological and genomic data drive assignment to one treatment arm. Therapeutic options are prioritized within a molecular report.
* Patient Monitoring / Follow-Up: Comprehensive documentation will be conducted at study entry and every 6 mths for 10 years.
* Pre-Clinical Companion Programs: The valuable pre- and post neoadjuvant biomaterial will be exploited to fuel collaborative studies around therapy failure, biomarker development and tracking of residual cancer burden in liquid biopsies (ctDNA).
