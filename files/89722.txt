Irinotecan and Temozolomide for Ewing Sarcoma
The investigators explored the activity of vincristine and irinotecan combined with temozolomide (VIT) in patients with relapsed and metastatic Ewing Sarcoma.

After standard multimodal therapy, the prognosis of relapsed and metastatic Ewing Sarcoma is dismal and unchanged over the last decades. The anti-tumor activity of VIT was demonstrated by several studies in the past. However, the detailed schedule of VIT was not decided. Thus, the investigators explored the activity of 5-d shorter schedule of VIT and 5-d x2w longer schedule of VIT in patients with relapsed and metastatic Ewing Sarcoma after the failure of first-line chemotherapy with doxorubicin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, ifosphamide and etoposide.
