Effect of Sleep Disorder on the Development of Lung Tumors
The goal of this observational study is to observe the lung tumor development in lung tumor patients with long-term sleep disorder. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* will long-term sleep disorder promote the malignancy of lung tumor
* if so, how exactly will the microenvironment of lung tumor change Participants will receive PSQI scale and MRI functional brain imaging before surgery, blood and tumor tissue will be collected during the surgery.

Researchers will set non-sleep disorder group as control group to see if lung tumor microenvironment change when long-term sleep disorder exists in lung tumor patiens.
