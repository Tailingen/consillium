Observational Study With Metronomic Oral Vinorelbine in Elderly Patients With Locally Advanced / Metastatic Non-small-cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
Vinorelbine is the first line reference drug in the elderly patient with locally advanced / metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The introduction of the oral formulation of vinorelbine has determined a further impulse to its use in 1st line and above all to its use as "metronomic" therapy. Metronomic chemotherapy offers the advantage of increasing the overall dosage of the drug administered, but reducing the side effects or making them more easily manageable; it is practically a question of administering fractionated doses of the drug continuously for long periods (generally up to the progression of unacceptable disease or toxicity). This study collects data on the efficacy and tolerability of oral metronomic vinorelbine in elderly patients with NSCLC, performed as per normal clinical practice.
