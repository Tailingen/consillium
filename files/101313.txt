Mobile Health Application (PACT) to Improve Engagement in Advance Care Planning
This clinical trial tests a new mobile health application (app) called Planning Advance Care Together (PACT) to help people with cancer talk about and plan for advance care planning (the care they would want if they were unable to communicate) with their loved ones and doctors. The development of the PACT mobile app may help future patients incorporate their social network (typically, but not exclusively, family) into the advance care planning process.
