Safety and Efficacy of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) Plus Binimetinib Alone or Pembrolizumab Plus Chemotherapy With or Without Binimetinib in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (mCRC) Participants (MK-3475-651/KEYNOTE-651)
The purpose of this study is to determine safety and tolerability and to establish a preliminary recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for the following combinations: pembrolizumab plus binimetinib (Cohort A), pembrolizumab plus mFOLFOX7 (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m\^2; leucovorin \[calcium folinate\] 400 mg/m\^2; fluorouracil \[5-FU\] 2400 mg/m\^2) (Cohort B), pembrolizumab plus mFOLFOX7 and binimetinib (Cohort C), pembrolizumab plus FOLFIRI (irinotecan 180 mg/m\^2; leucovorin \[calcium folinate\]400 mg/m\^2; 5-FU 2400 mg/m\^2 over 46-48 hours) (Cohort D), and pembrolizumab plus FOLFIRI and binimetinib (Cohort E).

Percentage of Participants Who Experienced Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT), The occurrence of any of the following toxicities during Part 1 of the study (the first 21 days for Cohort A, first 28 days for Cohorts B,C, D, \& E), if possibly, probably or definitely related to study treatment, was considered a DLT:

Grade (Gr) 4 non hematologic toxicity, Gr 4 hematologic toxicity lasting \>7 days, Gr 3 thrombocytopenia, Any non-hematologic AE ≥Gr 3 in severity, Any Gr 3 or Gr 4 non-hematologic laboratory value, Febrile neutropenia Gr 3 or Gr 4, Any prolonged delay in initiating study therapy due to a treatment-related AE that started during the DLT period, Any treatment-related toxicity that causes the participant to discontinue treatment during the DLT period, Missing \>25% of binimetinib doses as a result of drug-related AE(s), Gr 5 toxicity, Cardiac disorders and vascular disorders, Eye disorders (Retinopathy or retinal detachment Gr ≥ 3)., Up to approximately first 28 days of treatment
Objective Response Rate (ORR) Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), ORR was determined in all participants and was defined as the percentage of participants who had a confirmed Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR). The percentage of participants who experienced CR or PR is presented. Per Protocol, analysis was per cohort., Up to Approximately 64 months
The purpose of this study is to determine safety and tolerability and to establish a preliminary recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for the following combinations: pembrolizumab plus binimetinib (Cohort A), pembrolizumab plus mFOLFOX7 (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m\^2; leucovorin \[calcium folinate\] 400 mg/m\^2; fluorouracil \[5-FU\] 2400 mg/m\^2) (Cohort B), pembrolizumab plus mFOLFOX7 and binimetinib (Cohort C), pembrolizumab plus FOLFIRI (irinotecan 180 mg/m\^2; leucovorin \[calcium folinate\]400 mg/m\^2; 5-FU 2400 mg/m\^2 over 46-48 hours) (Cohort D), and pembrolizumab plus FOLFIRI and binimetinib (Cohort E).
