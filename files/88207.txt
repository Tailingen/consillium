To Assess the Safety of Continuous IV Administration of Plerixafor and Assess Impact on the Immune Microenvironment in Patients With Pancreatic, Ovarian and Colorectal Adenocarcinomas
A dose escalation trial to assess the safety of plerixafor in patients with advanced pancreatic, high grade serous ovarian and colorectal cancer. To identify the proof of mechanism, by demonstrating alterations in T-cell tumour distribution, ideally associated with loss of tumour cells, measured by immunostaining, and changes in FDG uptake.
Pancreas Cancer
DRUG: Plerixafor
Causality of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) and grading according to NCI CTCAE v.4.03., Assess safety of continuous IV administration of plerixafor in doses needed to achieve and maintain circulating levels similar to those active in a murine model of PDAC (2 Î¼g/ml), From baseline through Day 56
Assessment of metabolic changes in tumour using non-invasive imaging (18FDG-PET), To explore objective anticancer clinical impact of this strategy., From baseline through Day 56
Change in T cell distribution within tumour regions within primary or metastatic lesions (e.g. CD3+ T cell accumulation in cancer cell "nests"), To explore relationships between intratumoural T-cell distribution, CXCR4 and CXCL12 immunostaining and other potential biomarkers of immune activation in tissue and blood, such as circulating CD34+ cell counts and diurnal cortisol variation., From baseline through Day 56|Changes in circulating tumour ctDNA levels within plasma, during and after treatment., From baseline through Day 56|Changes in proliferation and apoptosis markers (e.g. Ki67/Mib1), changes in tumour cell populations in samples., To assess modulation of the immune tumour microenvironment following CXCR4 inhibition by plerixafor administration., From baseline through Day 56|Changes in immune cytokine serum levels., From baseline through Day 56|T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing in tumour tissue., From baseline through Day 56|DNA and RNA sequencing in tumour tissue., From baseline through Day 56|Evidence of systemic pharmacodynamic response to CXCR4i, such as increase in CD34+ cell numbers in blood., From baseline through Day 56|Correlation between changes in T cell distribution and diurnal cortisol variation., From baseline through Day 56
This is a prospective, non-randomised, open label, Phase I, dose escalation trial of plerixafor in patients with histological documentation of advanced pancreatic, high grade serous ovarian or colorectal adenocarcinoma. We will investigate the feasibility of administering plerixafor in terms of safety, and will try to identify the proof of mechanism in patients. This trial will follow the standard 3+3, Phase I trial design, leading to a treatment expansion phase to confirm the RP2D.
