A Study to Evaluate the Benefit of Adding Durvalumab After Chemotherapy, Durvalumab and Surgery in Patients With Early-stage, Operable, Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.
ADOPT-LUNG is an international, multicentre, open-label randomised phase III trial. Protocol treatment consists of 3-4 cycles of neoadjuvant durvalumab in combination with platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, followed by surgery. Patients with R0 and R1 only resection will be randomised to receive either adjuvant durvalumab for 12 cycles (experimental arm) or observation (control arm). The primary objective of the study is to determine whether additional adjuvant immunotherapy with durvalumab after neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy has an effect on disease-free survival (DFS) in patients who do not achieve complete pathological response (pCR) as per local assessment according to the IASLC recommendations.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Adjuvant durvalumab
Disease-free survival (DFS), Assessed in the adjuvant treatment phase.

DFS is defined as the time from the date of randomisation until disease recurrence (including loco-regional recurrence, a distant (metastatic) recurrence or a second primary) or death from any cause. Censoring (for patients without recurrence/death) will occur at the date of last tumour assessment. Patients without a post-randomisation tumour assessment will be censored at the date of randomisation (plus 1 day). DFS will be assessed in patients without pCR (primary endpoint), as well as in patients with pCR (secondary endpoint) and in patients with/without ctDNA clearance (secondary endpoints)., From the date of randomisation until last patient last visit (approximately 60 months after randomisation of the first patient)
DFS in patients with pCR, Assessed in the adjuvant treatment phase (after randomisation).

DFS is defined as the time from the date of randomisation until disease recurrence (including loco-regional recurrence, a distant (metastatic) recurrence or a second primary) or death from any cause. Censoring (for patients without recurrence/death) will occur at the date of last tumour assessment. Patients without a post-randomisation tumour assessment will be censored at the date of randomisation (plus 1 day). DFS will be assessed in patients without pCR (primary endpoint), as well as in patients with pCR (secondary endpoint) and in patients with/without ctDNA clearance (secondary endpoints)., From the date of randomisation until last patient last visit (approximately 60 months after randomisation of the first patient)|Overall survival (OS) in patients with/without pCR, Assessed in the adjuvant treatment phase (after randomisation).

OS is defined as the time from the date of randomisation until death from any cause. Censoring (for patients who are not reported as having died) will occur at the date when they were last known to be alive. Patients without post-randomisation information will be censored at the date of randomisation (plus 1 day). OS will be assessed in patients with/without pCR., From the date of randomisation until last patient last visit (approximately 60 months after randomisation of the first patient)|DFS in patients with/without ctDNA clearance, Assessed in the adjuvant treatment phase (after randomisation)., From the date of randomisation until last patient last visit (approximately 60 months after randomisation of the first patient)|Time to recurrence (TTR) in patients with/without pCR, Assessed in the adjuvant treatment phase (after randomisation).

TTR is defined as the time from the date of randomisation until disease recurrence. Censoring (for patients without recurrence) will occur at the date of the last tumour assessment. Patients without a post-randomisation tumour assessment will be censored at the date of randomisation (plus 1 day). TTR will be assessed in patients with/without pCR., From the date of randomisation until last patient last visit (approximately 60 months after randomisation of the first patient)|Time to treatment discontinuation (TTD) in patients with/without pCR, Assessed in the adjuvant treatment phase (after randomisation)., From the date of randomisation until last patient last visit (approximately 60 months after randomisation of the first patient)|Toxicity according to CTCAE v5.0, Assessed in the adjuvant treatment phase (after randomisation).

All safety parameters will be summarised in tables to evaluate the toxicity/safety profile of the protocol treatment based on:

* Adverse events according to CTCAE v5.0 (any-cause as well as treatment-related) including adverse events leading to dose interruptions, withdrawal of protocol treatment, and death.
* Severe, serious, and selected adverse events.
* Deaths.
* Laboratory parameters and abnormalities, and vital signs., From the date of randomisation until last patient last visit (approximately 60 months after randomisation of the first patient)
