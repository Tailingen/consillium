Axitinib and Pembrolizumab in Subjects With Advanced Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma and Other Soft Tissue Sarcomas
The purpose of this research study is to test if Axitinib together with Pembrolizumab can slow tumor growth and know the side effects of the combination treatment.
Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma|Soft Tissue Sarcomas
DRUG: Axitinib|DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Percentage of Evaluable Participants Achieving Progression-Free Survival (PFS) at 3 Months, Percentage of participants who are disease progression free 3 months after initiation of therapy. Disease progression will be evaluated from imaging measures using the Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1., 3 Months
Percentage of Evaluable Participants Achieving Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective Response Rate (ORR) is defined as achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) from imaging measures using (RECIST) 1.1., Up to 2 Years|Percentage of Evaluable Participants Achieving Clinical Benefit Response (CBR), CBR is defined as achieving complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) from imaging measures using (RECIST) 1.1., Up to 2 Years|Time to Progression (TTP), Time to progression (TTP) is defined as time from treatment initiation until documented disease progression according to Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) or death (by any cause, in the absence of progression). In progression-free patients, PFS will be censored at the last evaluable tumor assessment., Up to 2 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS is (OS) is defined as the time from treatment initiation to death from any cause, whichever is earlier. Participants alive or those lost to follow-up will be censored at the last date of contact (or last date known to be alive)., Up to 5 years|Number of Participants Experiencing Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Dose-Limiting Toxicities, and Grade 3 or Higher Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, The number of participants experiencing serious adverse events (SAEs), dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), and grade 3 or higher treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs). AEs, SAEs and DLTs will be evaluated by treating physician using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), version 4.03. Treatment-emergent adverse events are those found to be definitely, probably and possibly related to study therapy., Up to 25 months
