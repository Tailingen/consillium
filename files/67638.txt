Captopril in Treating Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer or Limited-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer That Has Been Previously Treated With Radiation Therapy With or Without Chemotherapy
RATIONALE: Captopril is a drug that may be able to decrease side effects caused by radiation therapy, and may improve the quality of life of patients with non-small cell lung cancer or limited-stage small cell lung cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well captopril works in decreasing side effects and improving the quality of life in patients who have received radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy for stage I, stage II, or stage IIIB non-small cell lung cancer or limited-stage small cell lung cancer.

DRUG: captopril
Incidence of Therapy-induced Lung Toxicity, Incidence of Grade 2+ radiation-induced pulmonary toxicity within 1 year after completion of radiation. Assuming that the incidence of pulmonary toxicity would be 50%, based on Fisher's exact test with a one-sided significance level of 0.05,168 randomized patients would be required to have 80% statistical power to detect a 40% relative reduction (from 50% to 30%) in the incidence of pulmonary toxicity while receiving captopril. Assuming that 15% of cases would not continue to the randomization stage and 5% of patients would be found ineligible, the target sample size was 205 patients. Given the actual sample size, power would be 25% and therefore p-values were not reported., Once all patients have been followed for at least 12 months
Correlation of Lung Toxicities With Biochemical Markers, Biomarker data will not be generated from these tissue specimens, therefore this analysis will not take place., Once all patients have been followed for at least 12 months|Correlation of Quality of Life With Late Effects as Measured by European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) C-30 or EORTC Lung Cancer Module (LC-13), Only 2 patients have the required data- only 1.2% of the planned enrollment and 2.5% of the actual enrollment- which is extremely problematic as this data cannot be generalized, leads to selection bias, and is not representative of the patient population. Therefore the analysis was not conducted., Baseline to 18 months post treatment|Persistence of Pulmonary Toxicity at 2 Years After Completion of Study Treatment, Patients who experienced a Grade 2+ radiation-induced pulmonary toxicity within 1 year after completion of radiation were assessed to determine if the toxicity persisted for 2 years., 2 years from completion of study treatment
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the effect of captopril on the incidence of pulmonary damage at 12 months after radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy in patients with stage II-IIIB non-small cell lung cancer, stage I central non-small cell lung cancer, or limited stage small cell lung cancer.
* Compare the quality of life of patients treated with captopril vs patients who undergo post-radiotherapy observation only.
* Determine the persistence of captopril's effect on pulmonary toxicity in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to participating center, total lung irradiated (\< 25% vs 25-37% vs more than 37%), prior surgery (yes vs no), and prior chemotherapy (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

* Arm I: Patients receive oral captopril 3 times daily for 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
* Arm II: Patients undergo observation only for 1 year. Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at months 3, 6, 12, and 18.

Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 205 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.
