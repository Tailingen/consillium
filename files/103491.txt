MRD negative rate is defined as the percentage of participants who have negative MRD by bone marrow aspirate at any timepoint., Up to 2 years and 6 months|Number of Participants with Adverse Events by Severity, An assessment of severity grade will be made according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), with the exception of cytokine release syndrome (CRS), and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). CRS and ICANS will be evaluated according to the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) consensus grading., Up to 2 years and 6 months|Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AE) as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, An AE is any untoward medical event that occurs in a participant administered an investigational product, and it does not necessarily indicate only events with clear causal relationship with the relevant investigational product., Up to 2 years and 6 months|Number of Participants with Laboratory Abnormalities, Number of participants with laboratory abnormalities will be reported., Up to 2 years and 6 months|Number of Participants with Vital Signs Abnormalities, Number of participants with vital signs abnormalities will be reported., Up to 2 years and 6 months|Cohorts A, B, C, D, E, and F: Levels of B-Cell Maturation Antigen (BCMA) Expressing Cells and Soluble BCMA, Levels of expression of BCMA-expressing plasma cells in the bone marrow as well as the level of soluble BCMA in blood will be reported., Up to 1 year|Cohorts A, B, C, D, E, and F: Systemic Inflammatory Cytokine Concentrations, Blood cytokine concentrations (Interleukin \[IL\]-6, IL-15, IL-10, and Interferon \[IFN-gamma\]) will be measured for biomarker assessment., Up to 1 year|Cohorts A, B, C, D, E, and F: Levels of JNJ-68284528 T Cell Expansion (proliferation), and Persistence, Levels of JNJ-68284528 T cell expansion (proliferation), and persistence via monitoring CAR-T positive cell counts and CAR transgene level will be reported., Up to 1 year|Cohorts A, B, C, D, E, and F: Number of Participants with Anti-JNJ-68284528 Antibodies, Number of participants exhibiting anti-drug antibodies for JNJ-68284528 will be reported., Up to 1 year|Cohorts G and H: Percentage of Participants with Complete Response (CR) or Better, CR or better is defined as the percentage of participants achieving CR or sCR prior to subsequent antimyeloma therapy in accordance with the IMWG criteria during or after the study treatment., Up to 2 years 6 months|Cohorts G and H: Percentage of Participants with MRD-negative CR or sCR, MRD-negative CR/sCR is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve MRD-negative status, as determined by NGS/NGF with sensitivity of 10\^-5, at any time after enrollment and prior to progressive disease or subsequent antimyeloma therapy and who achieve CR/sCR or better., Up to 2 years 6 months|Cohorts G and H: Progression-free Survival on Next-line Therapy (PFS2), PFS2 is defined as the time interval between the start of study treatment and date of event, which is defined as death from any cause or PD as assessed by investigator that starts after the next line of therapy, whichever occurs first., Up to 2 years and 6 months|Cohorts G and H: Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the start of study treatment to the date of the participant's death., Up to 2 years and 6 months|Cohorts G and H: Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the start of study treatment to the date of first documented disease progression, as defined in the IMWG criteria, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 2 years and 6 months|Cohorts G and H: Number of Participants with Measurable Replication Competent Lentivirus (RCL) in Whole Blood, Number of participants with measurable RCL in whole blood will be reported., Up to 2 years and 6 months
