Study of Orally Administered MOMA-341 in Participants With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This Phase 1, multi-center, open-label, dose escalation and dose optimization study is designed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PDx), and preliminary clinical activity of MOMA-341 administered orally as a single agent or combination therapy in patients with microsatellite instability high (MSI-H) or DNA mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) solid tumors.

MOMA-341 is a novel therapeutic agent designed to target microsatellite instability high (MSI-H) or DNA mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) cancers by inhibiting Werner helicase. MOMA-341 is being developed as a single agent and in combination with either chemotherapy or immunotherapy in patients with certain advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

This phase 1, first-in-human, open-label study of MOMA-341 is primarily intended to evaluate the safety and tolerability of MOMA-341 when administered orally as a single agent (Treatment Arm 1), in combination with irinotecan (Treatment Arm 2), or in combination with immunotherapy (Treatment Arm 3). Each treatment arm of the study includes a dose-escalation phase, which means successive cohorts of patients will receive increasing oral doses of MOMA-341 as a single agent or in combination with irinotecan or immunotherapy to determine the presumptive optimal biologic dose(s) (OBD) in this population. The study also includes a dose-optimization phase that will enroll additional patients to support the confirmation of the OBD.

The data from this study conducted in patients with MSI-H or dMMR advanced or metastatic solid tumors, including safety, tolerability, PK/PDx findings, and antitumor activity, will form the basis for subsequent clinical development of MOMA-341 as a single-agent and in combination with irinotecan or immunotherapy.
