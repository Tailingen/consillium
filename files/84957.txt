The responses are reported using a verbal rating scale. The item and scale scores are transformed to a 0 to 100 scale. A higher score represents greater HRQoL, better functioning, and more (worse) symptoms., Baseline up to 12 years and 5 months|Change from Baseline in Health-Related Quality of Life as Assessed by MySIm-Q Scale Score, The MySIm-Q is a disease-specific PRO assessment complementary to the EORTC-QLQ-C30. It includes 17 items with recall period of "7 days" and responses are reported on a 5-point verbal rating scale. Item responses are scored from 0 to 4. Higher scores indicate greater severity/impact., Baseline up to 12 years and 5 months|Change from Baseline in Health-Related Quality of Life as Assessed by European Quality of Life - 5 Dimensions-5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L) Scale Score, The EQ-5D-5L is a generic measure of health status. The EQ-5D-5L is a 5-item questionnaire that assesses 5 domains including mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each of the 5 dimensions is divided into 5 levels of perceived problems, where Level 1: no problem, Level 2: slight problems, Level 3: moderate problems, Level 4: severe problems and Level 5: extreme problems, plus a visual analog scale rating "health today" with anchors ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state)., Baseline up to 12 years and 5 months|Change from Baseline in Health-Related Quality of Life as Assessed by Patient Global Impression of Symptom Severity (PGIS) Scale Score, The PGIS uses 2 items to assess the participant's perception of the severity of their disease symptoms and impact using a 5-point verbal rating scale.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant plasma cell disorder characterized by the production of monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) proteins or protein fragments (M proteins) that have lost their function. JNJ-68284528 (ciltacabtagene autoleucel \[cilta-cel\]) is an autologous chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy that targets B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), a molecule expressed on the surface of mature B lymphocytes and malignant plasma cells. The primary hypothesis of this study is that in participants with newly diagnosed MM, treatment with VRd induction followed by a single administration of cilta-cel will significantly improve progression free survival compared to Bortezomib, Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone (VRd) induction followed by Rd maintenance. The study will screen participants with newly diagnosed MM who are not planned to receive autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) as initial therapy. This study will be conducted in 4 phases: Screening (up to 28 days), Pre-randomization Treatment, Treatment, and Follow-up. Assessments like patient-reported outcome(s) (PROs), electrocardiogram (ECG), vital signs and pharmacokinetics will be performed during the study. Safety evaluations will include review of adverse events, laboratory test results, vital sign measurements, physical examination findings, assessment of cardiac function, Immune-Effector Cell-Associated Encephalopathy (ICE) and handwriting assessments (only for Arm B) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status. Safety data will be periodically reviewed by an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC). The duration of the study is approximately 12 years 5 months.
