Artificial Intelligence Enables Precision Diagnosis of Cervical Cytology Grades and Cervical Cancer
Cervical cancer, the fourth most common cancer globally and the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths, can be effectively prevented through early screening. Detecting precancerous cervical lesions and halting their progression in a timely manner is crucial. However, accurate screening platforms for early detection of cervical cancer are needed. Therefore, it is urgent to develop an Artificial Intelligence Cervical Cancer Screening (AICS) system for diagnosing cervical cytology grades and cancer.

Area under ROC curve (AUC), Area under the curve, Diagnostic evaluation will be performed within 1 week when the smear pictures are obtained
Specificity, The true negative rate (TNR) of the diagnostic platform, which is the ratio between the number of negative individuals correctly categorized by platform and the total number of actual negative individuals (%)., Diagnostic evaluation will be performed within 1 week when the smear pictures are obtained|Sensitivity, The true positive rate (TPR) of the diagnostic platform, which is the ratio between the number of positive individuals correctly categorized by platform and the total number of actual positive individuals (%)., Diagnostic evaluation will be performed within 1 week when the smear pictures are obtained|Accuracy, The quantity of true positive (TP) plus true negative (TN) over the quantity of (TP) plus true negative (TN) plus false positive (FP) plus false negative (FN)., Diagnostic evaluation will be performed within 1 week when the smear pictures are obtained
