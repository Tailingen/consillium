Efficacy and Safety of Endoscopic Submucosal Tunnel Dissection for Superficial Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
To evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of endoscopic submucosal tunnel dissection for superficial esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
Esophageal Superficial Mucosal Lesion
PROCEDURE: ESTD|PROCEDURE: ESD
The procedure time, Procedure time was defined as the time from marking of the lesion until complete removal of the specimen,including hemostasis., day 1
The rate of bleeding during operation, The hemorrhage observed during the operation, day 1|The rate of injury to the muscular layer, The injury to the muscular layer observed during the operation, day 1
This multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the tunnel technique in ESD of superficial esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Specifically the tunnel technique would be compared to conventional method on the procedure time and the muscular layer injury rate in patients scheduled for ESD with indication of ESCC.
