An Investigational Immunotherapy Study of BMS-986299 Alone and in Combination With Nivolumab and Ipilimumab in Participants With Solid Cancers That Have Spread or Cannot be Removed
The purpose of this study is to determine whether BMS-986299 both by itself and in combination with Nivolumab and Ipilimumab is safe and tolerable in the treatment of advanced solid tumors. In addition, the ability of study drugs to stimulate an immune response against cancer will be investigated.
