A Study of Capecitabine Rapid Disintegrating Tablets (RDT) Versus Commercial Xeloda in Patients With Solid Tumours
This randomized, open-label, two-way crossover study will evaluate the relative bioavailabilty and safety of capecitabine rapid disintegrating tablets (RDT) versus commercial Xeloda tablets in patients with colorectal or breast cancer. Patients will be randomized to a sequence of single oral doses of capecitabine RDT or Xeloda on Days 1 and 2 of a 14-day treatment cycle with Xeloda. Follow-up will be 30 days.
