Relationship Between Serum Î²2-Microglobulin and Infiltration of CD8+ in the Tumor Tissue of Hodgkin's Lymphoma Patients
In newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma patients, pre-treatment Beta-2 Microglobulin (B2M) levels will be measured. A thorough baseline assessment will be performed using CT imaging, and tumor tissue samples will be collected for Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis to quantify CD8+ cell infiltration. Patients will be closely monitored throughout their treatment, with a follow-up CT scan at the end of therapy to evaluate therapeutic response. This study aims to investigate the correlation between pre-treatment B2M levels and CD8+ immune cell infiltration in tumor tissues, assessing their potential as predictive markers for chemotherapy response.
