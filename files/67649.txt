A Study Comparing Denosumab vs. Zoledronic Acid for the Treatment of Bone Metastases in Breast Cancer Subjects.
The purpose of this study is to determine if denosumab is non-inferior to zoledronic acid in the treatment of bone metastases in subjects with advanced breast cancer.
Bone Metastases
BIOLOGICAL: Denosumab|DRUG: Zoledronic Acid
Time to First On-Study Skeletal Related Event (SRE) (Non-inferiority), Time to first on-study skeletal-related event (SRE) using a non-inferiority analysis. The median time to first skeletal-related event could not be estimated in one treatment arm, so the subject incidence is presented., Up to 34 months
Time to First On-Study Skeletal-Related Event (Superiority), Time to first on-study skeletal-related event (SRE) using a superiority analysis. The median time to first skeletal-related event could not be estimated in one treatment arm, so the subject incidence is presented., Up to 34 months|Time to First and Subsequent On-Study Skeletal-Related Event, Time to first and subsequent on-study skeletal-related event (SRE) using a multiple event analysis. To be considered a subsequent SRE, the event must occur at least 21 days after the previous SRE. This outcome measure utilizes multiple event times, was analyzed based on a proportional mean model, and is therefore more appropriately summarized by the cumulative number of events., Up to 34 months
