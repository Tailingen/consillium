Study of Venetoclax in Combination With Azacytidine in AML Patients Selected Using Ex Vivo Drug Sensitivity Screening
This is a multi center two-stage, two-arm, open label phase II study of venetoclax in combination with azacytidine in acute myeloid leukemia patients selected for therapy with ex vivo venetoclax sensitivity screening. This study will characterize the usability of ex vivo drug sensitivity testing for patient selection for selecting the responsive patients for venetoclax therapy. The exploratory study will aim to find novel combinations for overcoming resistance as well as finding/validating biomarkers for both sensitivity and resistance.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Venetoclax
