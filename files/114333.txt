Dose Ranging Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of SCV-07 for the Delay to Onset of Severe Oral Mucositis in Patients Receiving Chemoradiation Therapy for Head and Neck Cancer
Oral Mucositis (OM) is a painful and debilitating side effect of many of the drug or radiation regiments used to treat cancer. This study examines the investigational drug SCV-07 and it's possible application in treating Oral Mucositis. Studies have shown that SCV-07 can possibly increase a broad immune system response, thus lowering the painful side effects experienced when treated for head and neck cancer.

The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of SCV-07 and it's ability to delay the onset of Oral Mucositis for patients receiving chemoradiation for head and neck cancer.
Oral Mucositis|Head and Neck Cancer
DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: SCV-07|DRUG: SCV-07
Safety will be assessed by collecting and recording AEs and laboratory assessments. Labs will be collected at screening,weekly throughout the subject's RT treatment and on the last day of radiotherapy., 7 Weeks|Efficacy of Oral Mucositis assessment will be completed by trained site personnel. The WHO score will be the primary measure and NCI CTCAE will be a secondary measure for assessing Oral Mucositis., 7 weeks
