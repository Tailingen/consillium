IMMULAB - Immunotherapy With Pembrolizumab in Combination With Local Ablation in Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)
This is a multicenter, single arm, prospective, open-label phase II trial investigating the clinical activity of peri-interventional treatment with the anti-PD1 antibody pembrolizumab in HCC patients who are candidates for local ablation via either radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or microwave ablation (MWA) or brachytherapy or combination of TACE with RFA, MWA or brachytherapy.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)
DRUG: Pembrolizumab|PROCEDURE: Radio Frequency Ablation (RFA)|PROCEDURE: Microwave Ablation (MWA)|RADIATION: Brachytherapy|DRUG: Transarterial Chemoembolisation (TACE)
Objective response rate (ORR) according to RECIST 1.1, Evaluation of ORR according to RECIST 1.1 after two cycles of pembrolizumab and before performing local ablation will allow testing of the hypothesis that pre-interventional treatment with pembrolizumab before local ablation will result in conversion / downstaging of borderline candidates for local ablation. Furthermore, ORR is generally accepted as a valid endpoint for efficacy evaluation in one-armed trials without control group., After 6 weeks (2 cycles) of treatment
Time to recurrence (TTR) according to RECIST 1.1, TTR and recurrence free survival, have meanwhile been accepted by medicinal agencies in drug approval processes as they allow for quicker efficacy assessment. This is most important in explorative clinical trials in early phases (like this phase II trial) as it allows for more rapid evaluation of the potential of new treatment approaches. Furthermore, many of these parameters are not influenced by follow-up therapies., 18 months of Follow Up|Recurrence free survival according to RECIST 1.1, TTR and recurrence free survival, have meanwhile been accepted by medicinal agencies in drug approval processes as they allow for quicker efficacy assessment. This is most important in explorative clinical trials in early phases (like this phase II trial) as it allows for more rapid evaluation of the potential of new treatment approaches. Furthermore, many of these parameters are not influenced by follow-up therapies., 18 months of Follow Up|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival will be evaluated and is still considered the gold standard for efficacy evaluation in clinical trials. Its major drawback is the potentially long observation period necessary for OS evaluation - especially in the curative setting as represented by the treatment approach in this trial., 18 months of Follow Up|Incidence and severity of adverse events, Incidence and severity of adverse events according to the current National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), 12 months of treatment + 18 months of Follow Up|Identification of molecular biomarkers in tumor tissue and blood samples by immunohistochemical and molecular analyses in a central lab, Correlation analyses between selected molecular parameters and clinical data to identify molecular biomarkers like PD-1, PD-L1 and PD-L2) and immune cell infiltrates (like e.g. IGHM, CD3, CD8, FOXP3, CD68, CD205) as well as chemokines (CXCL9. CXCL10, CXCL13) and invasion markers (MMP7, MMP9) in tumor tissue and blood samples predictive for ORR, TTR, recurrence free survival and OS. Analyses will be performed by immunohistochemical and molecular methods in a central lab., 9 weeks of treatment
The multimodal approach of combining peri-interventional administration of an immune checkpoint inhibitor and local ablation via RFA / MWA / brachytherapy or combination of TACE with RFA, MWA or brachytherapy harbors the potential to satisfy the unmet need for an improvement in the outcomes of HCC patients treated with RFA / MWA/ brachytherapy or combination of TACE with RFA, MWA or brachytherapy. Furthermore, early clinical data indicates that the combination of immune checkpoint inhibition with RFA, MWA or brachytherapy displays an acceptable safety profile, resulting in a positive benefit-risk ratio of this trial.
