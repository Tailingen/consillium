Effects of Pre-emptive Scalp Infiltration With Ketorolac and Ropivacaine for Post-craniotomy Pain
The PAINLESS study is a single-center, prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded-endpoint (PROBE) controlled clinical study to compare the efficacy and safety of pre-emptive scalp infiltration with ropivacaine plus ketorolac and ropivacaine alone for postoperative pain relief in adults undergoing elective supratentorial craniotomies.

The proposed study will be a single-center, prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded-endpoint clinical trial designed to test the hypothesis that the addition of ketorolac to pre-emptive scalp infiltration analgesia can significantly improve analgesia after craniotomies. One hundred participants will be randomized to the ketorolac group or the control group. Patients in the ketorolac group will receive pre-emptive scalp infiltration with opivacaine,ketorolac and epinephrine while patients in the control group will receive pre-emptive scalp infiltration with ropivacaine and epinephrine.The primary outcome measure will be cumulative doses of patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) butorphanol consumption from 0 to 48 h postoperatively.
