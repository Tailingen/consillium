Safety Study of Aminolevulinic Acid (ALA) to Enhance Visualization and Resection of Tumors of the Brain
The prodrug, 5-Aminolevulinic acid (ALA), has been shown to lead to intracellular accumulation of fluorescent porphyrins in high grade malignant gliomas in the brain. On imaging, this accumulation of fluorescent porphyrins helps delineate tumor borders, resulting in the surgeon being better able to visualize and thus able to make a complete, or near-complete resection of the tumor.

The drug, 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), which leads to intracellular accumulation of fluorescent porphyrins in gliomas will be used under investigation for identification and resection of high and low grade gliomas. Surgery will be done using a modified neurosurgical microscope, with a fluorescent kit that enables switching from the conventional white light to a violet-blue excitation light for visualization during tumor resection. If deemed safe by the neurosurgeon, any area of the resection bed determined to be fluorescence-positive for tumor will be removed with appropriate designation of tissue for histopathological evaluation. After this resection, additional fluorescence images will be obtained and the process repeated until the image is negative for tumor. At all times, the decision to resect will be limited by clinical judgment of safety.

The desire is that a more complete resection will occur due to the surgeon's ability to better visualize and distinguish between tumor and normal tissue, and thus be able to remove as much, or most of, the tumorous tissue, resulting in a better outcome for the patient, or for future patients.
