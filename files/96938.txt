Study of PF-05212384 (Also Known as PKI-587)Administered Intravenously To Subjects With Solid Tumors
This is a two-part study of a compound called PF-05212384 (also known as PKI-587). The purpose of part 1 is to identify the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of PF-05212384 using a Continual Reassessment Method (CRM). Part 1 will include subjects with any solid tumor. In Part 2 two cohorts will be enrolled. One cohort will assess safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy in 20 subjects at the MTD and will include subjects with breast cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, colorectal cancer renal cancer or glioblastoma (a type of brain tumor). The other cohort will include 5 to 15 subjects with any type of tumor who consent to provide tumor biopsies while participating in the study.

Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) or Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent were events between first dose of study drug and up to Cycle 14, that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state.
