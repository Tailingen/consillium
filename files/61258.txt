Targeting Pediatric Brain Tumors and Relapsed/Refractory Solid Tumors With Sodium Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitors (SGLT2i)
This is a pilot phase Ib study of the feasibility and safety of dapagliflozin (in addition to standard of care treatment) for the treatment of pediatric patients with recurrent brain tumors and relapsed/refractory solid tumors. The primary hypothesis is that dapagliflozin is well-tolerated and safe to use in this patient population. The investigators also hypothesize that dapagliflozin will be efficacious as an adjunct to front-line chemotherapy assessed by decreased tumor markers mediated by its pleiotropic metabolic effects.
Pediatric Brain Tumor|Pediatric Solid Tumor
DRUG: Dapagliflozin|DRUG: Carmustine|DRUG: Topotecan|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide
Number and type of adverse events experienced by participants, -Adverse events will be graded by CTCAE (version 5.0)., From start of treatment through 30 days after last day of dapagliflozin treatment (estimated to be 4 months)
Change in blood glucose, From baseline through end of treatment (estimated to be 3 months)|Feasibility of regimen, -Feasibility is defined as the successful enrollment of a total of 20 evaluable patients to the study within 3 years and the optimal dose of dapagliflozin is at least 5 mg., Through completion of treatment for all enrolled patients (estimated to be 39 months)|Change in ketones, From baseline through end of treatment (estimated to be 3 months)|Change in HbA1c, From baseline through end of treatment (estimated to be 3 months)|Changes in fructosamine, From baseline through end of treatment (estimated to be 3 months)|Changes in c-peptide, From baseline through end of treatment (estimated to be 3 months)|Changes in glucagon, From baseline through end of treatment (estimated to be 3 months)|Imaging-guided tumor response assessment, * Tumor response will be evaluated using the updated response assessment criteria for high-grade gliomas: Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) working group guideline for brain tumor patients.
* Tumor response will be evaluated using RECIST 1.1 for solid tumor patients., From pre-therapy to post-12 weeks of therapy|Tumor response rate as measured by number of participants with complete response or partial response, * Tumor response will be evaluated using the updated response assessment criteria for high-grade gliomas: Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) working group guideline for brain tumor patients.
