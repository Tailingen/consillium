Elranatamab Expanded Access Protocol in Adults With Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma
Elranatamab is a bispecific antibody: binding of elranatamab to CD3- expressing T-cell and BCMA- expressing multiple myeloma cells causes targeted T-cell mediated cytotoxicity.

This expanded access protocol will provide access to elranatamab until it becomes commercially accessible to patients who are refractory to at least one proteasome inhibitor, one immunomodulatory drug and one anti-CD38 antibody and have no access to other comparable/alternative therapy and for whom elranatamab could be a possible treatment option.
