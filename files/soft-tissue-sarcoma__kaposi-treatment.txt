Epidemiology
Kaposi sarcoma (KS) was first described in 1872 by the Hungarian
dermatologist, Moritz Kaposi.  From that time until the HIV and AIDS epidemic, KS remained a rare tumor.  Classic KS is most commonly seen in Europe and North America in older men of Italian
or Eastern European Jewish ancestry,[
1
]  and endemic KS is most commonly seen in sub-Saharan Africa. The disseminated, fulminant form of KS associated with HIV disease is
referred to as AIDS-associated KS to distinguish it from classic and
endemic KS. Transplant-related KS (also sometimes  called iatrogenic KS) is seen in patients receiving chronic immunosuppression therapy, such as after organ transplant.[
2
,
3

Histopathology
Although
the histopathology of the different types of KS is essentially
identical, the clinical manifestations and course of the
disease differ dramatically.[
2
]  Human herpesvirus 8
(HHV8), also known as Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, was identified
in KS tissue biopsies from almost all patients with classic,
endemic, AIDS-associated, and transplant-related KS but was absent from noninvolved
tissue.[
2
]
Classic Kaposi Sarcoma
Classic KS is considered a rare disease. It occurs more often in men, at a ratio
of approximately 10 to 15 men to 1 woman.  In North American and European populations,
the usual age at onset is between 50 and 70 years.  Classic KS tumors
usually present with one or more asymptomatic red, purple, or brown patches,
plaques, or nodular skin lesions.  The disease is often limited to single or
multiple lesions usually localized to one or both lower extremities, especially
involving the ankles and soles.
Classic KS most commonly runs a
relatively benign, indolent course for 10 to 15 years or more, with slow
enlargement of the original tumors and the gradual development of additional
lesions.  Venous stasis and lymphedema of the involved lower extremity are
frequent complications.  In long-standing cases, systemic lesions can develop
along the gastrointestinal tract, in lymph nodes, and in other organs.  The
visceral lesions are generally asymptomatic and are most often discovered only
at autopsy, though clinically, gastrointestinal bleeding can occur.  As many as 33% of patients with classic KS develop a second primary malignancy,
which is most often non-Hodgkin lymphoma.[
4
]
Endemic Kaposi Sarcoma
Endemic KS refers to KS diagnosed in patients, typically children and younger adults, living in sub-Saharan Africa. This classification was based on several reports from the 1950s of KS in this younger HIV-negative cohort in human herpesvirus–endemic African countries. Prior to the AIDS epidemic, the estimated incidence for endemic KS was highest (>6 per 1,000 person-years) in Uganda, Tanzania, Cameroon, and Congo. The etiology behind endemic KS is unclear but may possibly be related to saliva-sharing practices, chronic infection, and malnutrition.[
3
]
The clinical presentation of endemic KS varies and differs between children and adults. Whereas adults present with disease that resembles classic KS, children can have more aggressive disease, including diffuse lymphadenopathy, significant lymphedema, and visceral dissemination.[
3
]
AIDS-Associated Kaposi Sarcoma
The use of antiretroviral therapy for patients with AIDS-associated KS has been associated with a sustained and substantial decline in KS incidence in multiple large cohorts.[
5
-
7
] Antiretroviral therapy has delayed or
prevented the emergence of drug-resistant HIV strains, profoundly decreased viral
load, led to increased survival, and lessened the risk of opportunistic
infections.[
8
] KS can still appear during antiretroviral therapy with complete suppression of HIV; most cases in the United States occur in patients with  high CD4 counts receiving ongoing antiretroviral therapy.[
9
]
The disease often progresses in an orderly fashion from a few localized or widespread mucocutaneous lesions that may involve the skin, oral mucosa, and lymph
nodes to more numerous lesions and generalized skin disease that involves visceral organs, such as the gastrointestinal tract, lung, liver, and
spleen.  Most patients with HIV disease who present with mucocutaneous
KS lesions feel healthy and are usually free of systemic symptoms, as
compared with HIV   patients who first develop an opportunistic
infection.  AIDS-associated KS presents at sites that are much more
varied than those seen in other types of this neoplasm.  While most patients present with skin
disease, KS involvement of lymph nodes or the gastrointestinal tract may
occasionally precede the appearance of the cutaneous lesions.
Transplant-Related Kaposi Sarcoma
Transplant-related KS (also called iatrogenic KS) is diagnosed in patients who are therapeutically immunosuppressed, such as after an organ transplant. In fact, solid-organ transplant recipients are 200-fold more likely to develop KS than the general population. Risk factors include male sex, older age, higher levels of immune suppression, and living in HHV8-endemic areas.[
3
]
Transplant-related KS typically yields cutaneous lesions, though mucosal and visceral disease can occur. The lesions commonly occur within the first several months of immunosuppression therapy and regress with changes or reductions in immunosuppression.[

Stage Information and Response Evaluation for Kaposi Sarcoma
In This Section
Staging
Response Evaluation
Staging
The staging evaluation of patients with classic Kaposi sarcoma (KS) should be
individualized.  The advanced age of most patients, localized nature
of the tumor, rarity of visceral involvement, and usually indolent course of
the disease should temper the extent of the evaluation.  A careful examination
of the skin and lymph nodes is sufficient in most cases.
For the rare 
patient with a rapidly progressive tumor or signs or symptoms of visceral
involvement, appropriate evaluation is indicated. No universally
accepted classification is available for AIDS-associated KS.  Staging schemes that incorporate laboratory parameters as well as clinical features have been proposed.  Since
most patients with AIDS-associated KS do not die of the disease, factors besides tumor burden are apparently involved in survival.
The conventions used to stage KS and the methods used to evaluate the benefits
of KS treatment continue to evolve because of changes in
the treatment of HIV and in recognition of deficiencies in standard tumor
assessment.  The clinical course of KS, the selection of treatment, and
the response to treatment are heavily influenced by the degree of underlying immune
dysfunction and opportunistic infections.
The AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) Oncology Committee has published criteria
for the evaluation of AIDS-associated KS.[
1
]  The staging system incorporates
measures of extent of disease, severity of immunodeficiency, and presence of
systemic symptoms.  As shown in
Table 1
below, the ACTG criteria categorize the extent of
the tumor as localized or disseminated, the CD4 cell number as high or low, and
systemic illness as absent or present.
A subsequent prospective analysis of
294 patients entered on ACTG trials for KS between 1989 and 1995 showed that
each of the tumor (T), immune system (I), and systemic illness (S) variables was
independently associated with survival.[
2
]  Multivariate analysis showed that
immune system impairment was the most important single predictor of survival. 
In patients with relatively high CD4 counts, tumor stage was predictive.  A CD4
count of 150 cells/µL may be a better discriminator than the
published cutoff of 200 cells/µL.  A study is under way to
determine if quantifying viral load adds predictive value.  None of the previous studies were conducted at a time when antiretroviral therapy was readily available.  The impact of antiretroviral therapy on
survival in KS requires continued assessment.

Response Evaluation
The ACTG proposed a unified treatment response evaluation system for AIDS-related KS for clinical practice and research.[
1
]   After appropriate clinical examination and relevant interval imaging or endoscopy, patients are characterized as having complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD), based on the following criteria:
CR:
No detectable residual disease and no tumor-related edema for at least 4 weeks.
PR:
No new mucocutaneous lesions, visceral disease, or worsening tumor-related edema. Existing sites show a 50% reduction in (1) the number of lesions, (2) the form of lesions (i.e. flattening of raised lesions), and/or (3) the sum of the products of the largest perpendicular diameters of five measurable lesions. If residual tumor-related edema is present despite meeting CR criteria, the response is still characterized as a PR.
PD:
Increase of  more than 25% in (1) the size of existing lesions and/or (2) the number of existing lesions that have more nodular or plaque-like form, or the development of new sites of disease.
SD:
No PR, CR, or PD.

Chemotherapy
Biological and targeted therapy
Immunotherapy
Current Clinical Trials
Classic Kaposi sarcoma (KS), as well as endemic KS in adult patients, is usually limited to the skin and has an indolent
course.   Thus, management for both is typically similar. Patients are predisposed to develop a
second primary malignancy, and the treating physician should consider this
factor when arranging a schedule of follow-up treatment for the patient.
Treatment Options for Localized Classic and Endemic Kaposi Sarcoma
Treatment options for localized skin disease include (options are equivalent):
Radiation therapy
.
Surgery
.
Other options (cryo-laser, intralesional, and topical therapy)
.
Radiation therapy
For solitary lesions or lesions of limited extent,
modest doses of radiation applied with a limited
margin provide excellent control of disease in the treated area.  Usually,
superficial radiation beams, such as electron beams, are used.  Some authors believe disease
recurrence in adjacent untreated skin is common if
only involved-field radiation therapy is used and claim better cure
rates when extended-field radiation therapy is used.[
1
]
For low-voltage (100 kv) photon radiation therapy,  8 Gy to 10 Gy is given as a single dose
or 15 Gy to 20 Gy is given over 1 week because solitary lesions control nearly
100% of local disease, but recurrence in adjacent areas is common.
For electron-beam radiation therapy (EBRT),  4 Gy is given once weekly for 6 to 8 consecutive weeks
with a 4-MeV to 6-MeV electron beam.  Ports should include the entire skin
surface 15 cm above the lesion.
Surgery
Surgical excision may benefit patients with small superficial
lesions,  but local recurrence is likely to occur.  However, multiple
small excisions can continue to be performed  for good disease
control.
Other options
Based on extent and accessibility of lesions, alternate modalities such as cryo-, laser, intralesional, and topical therapy can be used. Use of these modalities is based on evidence extrapolated from treatment of AIDS-associated KS.[

Treatment Options for Advanced Classic and Endemic Kaposi Sarcoma
Treatment options for advanced skin disease include:
Radiation therapy
.
Chemotherapy
.
Biological and targeted therapy
.
Immunotherapy
.
Radiation therapy
Modest doses can be effective in controlling widespread skin disease.  The
type of radiation (i.e., photon vs. electron) and fields used must be
tailored to suit the distribution of disease in the individual patient.[
1
] Radiation therapy options include:
Extended-field EBRT.
For
disease limited to areas distal to the knee,  subtotal-skin EBRT directed to skin below the umbilicus.
For disease that extends above the knee, total-skin EBRT.
EBRT used in this manner gave long-term results that were superior to
those obtained with radiation therapy administered to successive individual lesions as they
appeared.[
4
]
For extensive disease, EBRT  4 Gy given once weekly for 6 to 8 consecutive weeks,
and subtotal- or total-skin radiation therapy.
Chemotherapy
Because classic KS is such a rare disease in
the United States, and is usually treated initially with radiation therapy, few
patients have been treated with chemotherapy. Its use in classic KS is based on data extrapolated from treatment of AIDS-associated KS, and no randomized prospective
trials have compared one agent with another in classic KS.  The agents listed below have potential benefit.
Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD)
PLD has shown activity in several case series and single-institution analyses.[
5
-
8
]
Evidence (PLD):
A multicenter trial included 55 patients with classic KS who were treated over a decade.[
5
]
A 71% overall response rate was seen using PLD, with a median response duration of 25 months.[
5
][
Level of evidence C3
]
Taxanes
Paclitaxel has shown activity in both AIDS-associated and classic KS in small case series.[
9
-
12
]
Evidence (taxanes):
A small trial included 73 patients with AIDS-associated KS (32% had an undetectable HIV viral load). Patients  were randomly assigned to receive either PLD or paclitaxel.[
9
]
Response rates were 46% for patients who received PLD and 56% for patients who received paclitaxel. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 12 months for patients who received PLD and 18 months for patients who received paclitaxel. The 2-year overall survival rates were 78% for patients who received PLD and 79% for patients who received paclitaxel.[
9
][
Level of evidence B3
]
Other chemotherapy agents
Single-agent vinblastine [
13
-
16
], oral etoposide [
17
-
19
], and gemcitabine [
20
-
22
] have all shown good activity in classic and AIDS-associated KS.
Evidence (other chemotherapy agents):
A phase III trial included 65 patients with classic KS. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either oral etoposide or vinblastine.[
18
]
Response rates were relatively high and did not significantly differ (58% for patients who received PLD and 74% for patients who received paclitaxel).[
18
][
Level of evidence B3
]
Biological and targeted therapy
Agents that modulate the immune system, such as imide drugs and interferon alfa-2b, have shown efficacy in both classic and AIDS-associated KS.
Pomalidomide
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved pomalidomide for the treatment of KS in patients with and without HIV.
Evidence (pomalidomide):
A phase I/II study of pomalidomide included 28 patients with KS. Ten patients were HIV-positive and 18 patients were  HIV-negative.[
23
]
The overall response rate was 71%, and  80% among patients without HIV. The median PFS was 10 months.[
23
]
Pomalidomide was generally well tolerated. Common adverse events included neutropenia, anemia, fatigue, constipation, and rash. There were few grade 3 events (neutropenia, infection, and edema).[
24
]
Pomalidomide is teratogenic, prescribed through a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program, and it should be given with aspirin to mitigate venous thromboembolism risk.
Interferon alfa-2b
The FDA approved interferon alfa-2b for the treatment of AIDS-associated KS. It is sometimes used off-label for classic KS.
Evidence (interferon alfa-2b):
A small case series included 16 patients without HIV.[
25
]
Treatment with interferon alfa-2b led to a response in ten patients (one complete response [CR], nine partial responses [PRs]).
Immunotherapy
Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy has been tested in classic KS and yielded promising results.
Pembrolizumab monotherapy
Evidence (pembrolizumab monotherapy):
Pembrolizumab monotherapy (given every 3 weeks for up to 6 months) was evaluated in a multicenter, single-arm, phase II study of 17 patients. Eight patients had classic KS and nine patients had endemic KS.[
26
][
Level of evidence C3
]
At a median follow-up of 20.4 months, with 88% of patients completing 6 months of treatment, the best overall response rate was 71% (12% with CR, 59% with PR). An additional 29% of patients had stable disease based on AIDS Clinical Trials Group response evaluation.
The median time to response was 5 months (interquartile range, 3.4–12), the estimated median duration of response was 23 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 21.2–not reached [NR]), and the median time to progression (TTP) was 24 months (95% CI, 15–NR).
Sixty-four percent (7 of 11) of pretreated patients and 83% (5 of 6) of chemotherapy-naïve patients had a CR or PR.
Pembrolizumab was generally well tolerated. Two patients (12%) had grade 3 events: acute cardiac decompensation and granulomatous reaction in the lung. Two patients discontinued treatment due to grade 2 pancreatitis and grade 3 acute cardiac decompensation, respectively.
Ipilimumab and nivolumab
Evidence (ipilimumab and nivolumab):
Ipilimumab and nivolumab combination therapy was evaluated in a phase II study of 18 patients with refractory classic KS. Patients received nivolumab 240 mg every 2 weeks and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks until disease progression, for up to 24 months.[
27
]
At a median follow-up of 24.4 months, the overall response rate was 87% by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. The 6- and 12-month PFS rates were 77% and 59%, respectively.[

Treatment of AIDS-associated  Kaposi sarcoma (KS) may result in the following:
The disappearance or reduction in size of specific skin
lesions, thereby alleviating the discomfort associated with the chronic edema
and ulcerations that often accompany multiple skin tumors seen on the lower
extremities.
Control of symptoms associated with mucosal or visceral
lesions.
No data are available to show that treatment improves
survival.[
1
] In addition to antitumor treatment, essential components of an
optimal KS treatment strategy in this population include antiretroviral
treatment, prophylaxis for opportunistic infections, and rapid recognition and
treatment of intercurrent infections. Therefore, close collaboration between oncologists and HIV specialists is vital.
Most patients with good-risk disease, defined by the AIDS Clinical Trials Group as T0, show tumor regression with antiretroviral therapy alone.[
2
-
4
] Patients with poor-risk disease, defined as T1, usually require a combination of antiretroviral therapy and chemotherapy with discontinuation of the chemotherapy after disappearance of the skin lesion.[

Treatment Options for AIDS-Associated Kaposi Sarcoma
Treatment options for AIDS-associated KS include:
Local modalities
.
Chemotherapy
.
Biological and targeted therapy
.
Local modalities
Small localized lesions of KS may be treated by electrodesiccation and
curettage, cryotherapy, or by surgical excision.  KS tumors are also generally
very responsive to local radiation therapy, and excellent palliation has been
obtained with doses at 20  Gy or slightly higher.[
5
,
6
] Radiation therapy is generally reserved to treat localized areas of the skin
and oral cavity.  It is used less often to control pulmonary, gastrointestinal
tract, or other sites of KS lesions.  Localized KS lesions have also
been effectively treated with intralesional injections of vinblastine.[
7
]
Alitretinoin 0.1% gel provided local control in a randomized, prospective, multicenter trial.[
8
][
Level of evidence B3
]
Chemotherapy
In AIDS-associated KS, the already profoundly depressed immunologic status of the patient
limits the therapeutic usefulness of systemic chemotherapy.  Systemic
chemotherapy studies in patients with AIDS-associated KS have used doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, vincristine, etoposide, paclitaxel, and docetaxel alone or in combination.[
9
-
13
][
Level of evidence C3
] The combination of antiretroviral therapy and liposomal doxorubicin resulted in a 5-year overall survival rate of 85% in 140 patients with T1 disease.[
3
][
Level of evidence C3
]
Randomized multicenter trials
showed an improvement in response rate (45%–60% vs. 20%–25%) and a more favorable toxic effects
profile for pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) or liposomal daunorubicin, compared with the combination of doxorubicin, bleomycin, and vincristine or bleomycin and vincristine.[
14
-
16
][
Level of evidence B3
]
During antiretroviral therapy, both PLD and paclitaxel are active single agents with response rates close to 50%.[
17
][
Level of evidence B3
]
Biological and targeted therapy
Interferon alfa
The interferon alfas have also been widely studied and show  a 40% objective
response rate in patients with AIDS-associated KS.[
18
,
19
]  In these reports, the
responses differed significantly according to the following prognostic factors:
Extent
of disease.
Prior or coexistent opportunistic infections.
Prior treatment with
chemotherapy.
CD4 lymphocyte counts lower than 200 cells/µL.
Presence of circulating acid-labile interferon alfa.
Increase in
beta-2-microglobulin.
Several treatment studies have combined interferon alfa
with other chemotherapeutic agents.  Overall, these trials have shown no
benefit with the interferon-chemotherapy combinations as compared with the
single-agent activities.
Recombinant interferon alfa-2a and recombinant interferon alfa-2b were the first agents
approved for the treatment of KS.  Approval was based on single-agent studies
performed in the 1980s before the advent of antiretroviral therapy.  The early
studies demonstrated improved efficacy at relatively high doses.
High-dose
monotherapy is rarely used today, and instead, interferon is given in
combination with other anti-HIV drugs in doses of 4 to 18 million units. 
Neutropenia is dose limiting, and trials of doses of 1 to 10 million units
combined with less myelosuppressive antiretroviral agents are in progress.  Response
to interferon is slow, and  the maximum effect is seen after 6 or more months.  
Interferon should probably not be used to treat patients with rapidly progressive,
symptomatic KS.
Imatinib
Imatinib is a c-kit/platelet-derived growth factor receptor inhibitor.
Evidence (imatinib):
A phase II trial included 30 patients with AIDS-associated KS.[
20
]
A partial response (PR) was seen in 10 of 30 previously treated patients . Previous treatment included antiretroviral therapy and chemotherapy.
Bevacizumab
Bevacizumab is a humanized, anti–vascular endothelial growth factor monoclonal antibody.
Evidence (bevacizumab):
A phase II study included 16 assessable patients with KS and HIV. Patients received bevacizumab intravenously (IV) on days 1 and 8 and then every 3 weeks.[
21
]
There was a response in 5 of 16 patients. These patients had not improved after prior antiretroviral therapy and chemotherapy.[

]
Interleukin-12
Evidence (interleukin-12):
A phase I and phase II trial included 24 evaluable patients. Patients received interleukin-12 subcutaneously twice weekly.[
22
]
Treatment resulted in a response rate of 71% (95% confidence interval, 48%–89%).[
22
][
Level of evidence C3
]
Pomalidomide
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved pomalidomide for patients with AIDS-associated KS.
Evidence (pomalidomide):
A phase I/II study of pomalidomide included 28 patients with KS. Ten patients were HIV-positive and 18 patients were HIV-negative.[
23
]
The overall response rate was 71%, and 80% among patients without HIV. The median progression-free survival was 10 months.[
23
]
Pomalidomide was generally well tolerated. Common adverse events included neutropenia, anemia, fatigue, constipation, and rash. There were few grade 3 events (neutropenia, infection, and edema).[
24
]
Pomalidomide is teratogenic, prescribed through a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program, and it should be given with aspirin to mitigate venous thromboembolism risk.
Bortezomib
Evidence (bortezomib):
Bortezomib was evaluated in a small phase I dose-escalation study of 17 patients with AIDS-associated KS. Patients received bortezomib IV on days 1, 8, and 15 of 28-day cycles.[
25
]
Bortezomib was relatively well tolerated and led to a PR in 60% of all evaluable patients. Among those receiving the highest bortezomib dose, 83% of patients had a PR and 17% had stable disease.
Management of Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome in AIDS-Associated Kaposi Sarcoma
Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) is a hyperimmune response in patients with HIV/AIDS within the first 6 months of starting antiretroviral therapy. Kaposi sarcoma (KS)-associated IRIS (KS-IRIS) is not well-defined, but is considered to be the sudden clinical worsening of previous KS ("paradoxical") or the new presentation of KS (“unmasked”) in close proximity to starting or modifying antiretroviral therapy.[
26
]
Estimates for KS-IRIS incidence vary from 2% to 39%, with the highest risk in patients with any of the following characteristics:[
26
,
27
]
High HIV viral loads (>10,000 copies/mL).
CD4 lymphocyte count less than 200 cells/µL.
Detectable plasma human herpesvirus  8 DNA.
Pulmonary KS involvement.
Recent steroid use.
KS-IRIS typically presents with increased swelling/tenderness of lesions, new or worsening edema, and visceral or pulmonary involvement.
Management of KS-IRIS typically includes continuing antiretroviral therapy and initiating systemic treatment, such as liposomal doxorubicin or paclitaxel, for KS. The evidence for use of chemotherapy to prevent KS-IRIS is mixed, but can be considered on an individual basis.[
26
]  Glucocorticoids are avoided due to the risk of dramatic worsening of KS.[
27
,
28
] Thalidomide has also been used for steroid-refractory IRIS.[

Treatment Options for Transplant-Related Kaposi Sarcoma
In general, transplant-related Kaposi sarcoma is effectively managed by reduction in immunosuppression and does not require systemic treatment. Transitioning immunosuppression therapy to an mTOR inhibitor, such as sirolimus, has demonstrated efficacy in small studies and can be considered.[
