An Exploratory Clinical Study of GC012F Injection for Refractory gMG
This study is a single-arm, open-label early exploratory clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of GC012F injection in subjects with refractory GMG. Additionally, the study aims to assess the pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD) characteristics, and immunogenicity of GC012F injection in subjects.

• Detection rate of CAR-T cell antibodies in peripheral blood within 24 weeks post-GC012F infusion;, Safety of GC012F, within 24 weeks post-GC012F infusion;|• Changes in serum immunoglobulin levels (including IgG, IgM, IgA, and IgE) in patients within 24 weeks post-GC012F infusion;, Safety of GC012F, within 24 weeks post-GC012F infusion|• Detection rate of replication-competent lentivirus (RCL)., Safety of GC012F, Within 15 years after GC012F injection infusion
This study is a single-arm, open-label early exploratory clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of GC012F injection in subjects with refractory GMG. Additionally, the study aims to assess the pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD) characteristics, and immunogenicity of GC012F injection in subjects.

The trial consists of several phases: screening period, apheresis day, baseline period, lymphodepletion period, pre-infusion assessment period, GC012F infusion period, safety and efficacy follow-up period, long-term follow-up period, and study discontinuation visit (if applicable).

Qualified subjects will undergo apheresis and receive the infusion after the production of CAR-T products. Subjects will undergo lymphodepletion before CAR-T cell infusion and assessment before infusion. Subjects meeting the cell infusion criteria will receive CAR-T cell infusion according to the dose specified in the protocol. Dose adjustments may occur based on safety and clinical efficacy for subjects in the same group or subsequent trial groups.
