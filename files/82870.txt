Fecal Microbiota Transplantation in Reversing Drug Resistance in Unresectable HCC (TALENP004)
This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in reversing drug resistance to the triple therapy regimen in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The triple therapy consists of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), lenvatinib, and Sintilimab. The study is a prospective, single-arm, multicenter clinical trial involving 15 participants with mid-to-late stage HCC that has progressed despite the triple therapy. FMT capsules will be prepared by matching the gut microbiome profiles of healthy donors to those of patients who achieved complete response (CR) with the triple therapy. The primary endpoints include objective response rate (ORR), treatment-related adverse events (AEs). Secondary endpoints will assess overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and disease control rate (DCR), changes in gut microbiome, metabolomics, and immune subsets before and after FMT.

OTHER: Fecal Microbiota Transplantation
Objective response rate, ORR, The Objective response rate (ORR) was defined as the complete response (CR) rate or the partial response (PR) rate according to RECIST1.1., Four weeks after the initiation of medication until the day before surgery|Adverse events, Grade 1-5 AEs according to NCI-CTCAE V5.0., From the initiation of medication, with recordings made whenever an adverse reaction occurs, assessed up to 12 months
Overall survival, OS, The Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time between receiving treatment and observing death or loss of follow-up for any reason., From date of enrollment until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 60 months|Progression free survival, PFS, The Progression free survival (PFS) was defined as the time between the start of treatment and the progression of intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic tumors, or the occurrence of death or loss of follow-up for any reason., From date of enrollment until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months|Disease control rate, DCR, The Disease control rate (DCR) was defined as the complete response (CR) rate or the partial response (PR) rate or stable disease (SD) rate according to RECIST1.1., Four weeks after the initiation of medication until the day before surgery|Gut Microbiome Composition after Fecal Microbiota Transplantation, The changes in the gut microbiome composition before and after FMT treatment, including diversity and similarity to the donor microbiome., Baseline and at the end of each treatment cycle (up to 6 cycles)|Gut Microbiome Metabolomic Changes after Fecal Microbiota Transplantation, The changes in serum and fecal metabolomics before and after FMT., Baseline and at the end of each treatment cycle (up to 6 cycles)|Gut Microbiome Immune Subset Variations after Fecal Microbiota Transplantation, The changes in immune cell subsets before and after FMT., Baseline and at the end of each treatment cycle (up to 6 cycles)
The study is designed to investigate the potential of FMT in overcoming resistance to a combined treatment approach for HCC. The triple therapy under investigation includes TACE, lenvatinib, and a PD-1 inhibitor, which has shown promise in treating HCC but has encountered issues with drug resistance.

This prospective, single-arm, multicenter trial will enroll 15 patients diagnosed with mid-to-late stage HCC that has progressed despite treatment with the triple therapy. The primary objective is to assess the safety and efficacy of FMT in this patient population, with the primary endpoints being ORR, AEs, OS, PFS, and DCR. Secondary endpoints will evaluate the changes in the gut microbiome composition, metabolomic profiles, and immune cell subsets before and after FMT.

Eligible participants must have HCC that has progressed following the triple therapy and meet specific inclusion criteria, including having at least one measurable lesion, an expected survival time greater than three months, and no prior FMT treatment. Exclusion criteria include a history of other malignancies within the past five years, autoimmune diseases, and the use of immunosuppressive agents.

FMT capsules will be made by analyzing the gut microbiome and metabolite profiles of patients who achieved a complete response to the triple therapy, and matching these with healthy donor profiles from a biobank. Patients will receive FMT capsules daily for three days, along with the continuation of the triple therapy. The study will also include procedures for dose adjustments based on adverse events and specific guidelines for managing toxicities related to the study treatments.

The study will conclude with a comprehensive analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints. This trial aims to provide valuable insights into the role of FMT in enhancing the efficacy of cancer treatments and overcoming drug resistance in HCC.
