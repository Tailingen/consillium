Searching for Predictive Biomarkers of Efficacy in Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients Treated With Chemotherapy-immunotherapy Combination Using Imaging Mass Cytometry (HYPE)
The goal of this retrospective study is to identify predictive biomarkers of efficacy in tumor samples of small cell lung cancer patients treated with chemotherapy-immunotherapy combination using imaging mass cytometry. The main question it aims to answer is: is there any feature in the tumour microenvironment that can discriminate responders from non responders before treatment? Participants will provide consent for the collection of their clinical data and the study of their tumor samples

Identification of predictive biomarkers of anti-PD-L1 efficacy in the tumor of small cell lung cancer patients, Features in the tumour microenvironment that can discriminate patients responding to anti-PD-L1 from non responders, 3 year
Progression-free survival, Time between treatment start and date of progression according to investigator, or death from any cause, 3 year|Overall survival, Time between treatment start and date of death from any cause, 3 year
Small cell lung cancer patients treated with first-line atezolizumab plus platinum-etoposide regimen with available formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) biopsies at baseline will be identified from Brest University Hospital medical records and their samples will be retrieved from Brest University Hospital Pathology Laboratory for imaging mass cytometry analyses.

Clinical data will be collected for each patient, including progression-free survival (defined as the time between treatment start and date of progression according to investigator, or death from any cause) and overall survival (defined as the time between treatment start and date of death from any cause).

For imaging mass cytometry analyses, a panel of 39 metal-tagged antibodies will be used to characterize the cell composition of lung tumors at baseline (inflammatory, tumor and stromal cells).

Statistical analyses will be performed to correlate the composition of the tumor microenvironment at baseline and the survival data.
