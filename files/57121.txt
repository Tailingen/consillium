Copper Cu 64 PSMA I&T PET Imaging in Men With Suspected Recurrence of Prostate Cancer
This is a prospective, open-label Phase 3 study to evaluate copper Cu 64 PSMA I\&T injection for PET/CT imaging in patients with recurrent prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy.

DRUG: Copper Cu 64 PSMA I&T
Patient-Level Correct Detection Rate (CDR), To determine the patient-level correct detection rate (CDR) of copper Cu 64 PSMA I\&T injection PET/CT imaging for the detection of recurrent metastatic prostate cancer between 60 minutes to 240 minutes post injection. The CDR is defined as the percentage of patients who have at least one true PET positive lesion, with exactly localized correspondence between PET imaging and the Composite Reference Standard, regardless of any co-existent false positive findings, out of all patients who are scanned., 4 hours|Region-Level Correct Localization Rate (CLR), To determine the region-level correct localization rate (CLR) of copper Cu 64 PSMA I\&T injection PET/CT imaging for the detection of recurrent metastatic prostate cancer between 60 and 240 minutes post injection. The CLR is defined as the percentage of regions containing at least one true PET positive lesion, with exactly localized correspondence between PET/CT imaging and the Composite Reference Standard regardless of any co-existent false positive findings, within the same region, out of all regions containing at least one PET positive finding., 4 hours
CDR and CLR by Prostate-Specific Antigen level, Comparison of patient level CDR and region level CLR of copper Cu 64 PSMA I\&T PET/CT stratified by Prostate-Specific Antigen level., 4 hours|CDR and CLR by histopathology available and histopathology unavailable, Comparison of patient-level CDR and region level CLR of copper Cu 64 PSMA I\&T PET/CT separated into subgroups of patients with histopathology available and unavailable., 4 hours|Inter-reader and intra-reader agreement of copper Cu 64 PSMA I&T PET/CT interpretation on a per-patient basis, Reader kappa statistics of copper Cu 64 PSMA I\&T PET/CT scan interpretation by the blinded independent readers., 4 hours|Incidence of adverse events of copper Cu 64 PSMA I&T injection, Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) will be assessed and graded using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0., At time of dose administration up to 72 hours
The study will include approximately 200 patients with suspected biochemically recurrant prostate cancer. Each patient will be administered an 8 mCi (± 10 percent) intravenous dose of copper Cu 64 PSMA I\&T injection. PET/CT imaging will be acquired for all patients at 1-4 hours ± 15 minutes post copper Cu 64 PSMA I\&T injection.

The PET/CT images will be interpreted independently by three readers blinded to all patient information. Each patient study will be assessed and scored for the detection of prostate cancer. Specifically, each reader will categorize images as "Disease" or "No Disease" based only on tumor uptake of copper Cu 64 PSMA-I\&T. Analysis of the reads will be used for determination of the patient-level correct detection rate and region-level correct localization rate of copper Cu 64 PSMA I\&T PET/CT by comparison to the Reference Standard.
