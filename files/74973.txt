Prospective Project to Identify Biomarkers of Morbidity and Mortality in Cardiovascular Interventional Patients
The objective of CAREBANK study is to establish definitive relationships with human cardiac samples and clinical phenotypes in patients undergoing cardiac procedures. Specifically, the investigators aim at comparing atrial phenotypes from atrial fibrillation patients and controls. The work consists of three broad categories: A) role of atrial cardiomyopathy in atrial fibrillation; B) genetic defects predisposing to atrial fibrillation; and C) the role of inflammation in atrial fibrillation.
Atrial Fibrillation|Coronary Artery Disease|Aortic Valve Stenosis|Aortic Valve Disease|Mitral Valve Disease|Cardiac Arrythmias|Cardiac Tumor|Cardiac Surgery
PROCEDURE: Cardiac surgery
Atrial fibrillation, Occurrence of atrial fibrillation, postoperatively until 5 years follow-up
Stroke, Occurrence of stroke, postoperatively until 5 years follow-up|Transient ischemic attack, Occurrence of Transient ischemic attack, postoperatively until 5 years follow-up|Myocardial infarction, Occurrence of Myocardial infarction, postoperatively until 5 years follow-up|Target vessel revascularization, Occurrence of Target vessel revascularization, postoperatively until 5 years follow-up|All-cause Mortality, All-cause Mortality, postoperatively until 5 years follow-up|Post-pericardiotomy syndrome, Occurrence of Post-pericardiotomy syndrome, postoperatively until 1 years follow-up
The investigators aim to A) compare atrial cardiomyopathy findings from the tissue samples to clinical phenotype and adverse events B) study the association of genetic defects predisposing to atrial fibrillation with atrial cardiomyopathy findings in the tissue samples C) assess the role of inflammation in atrial fibrillation by comparing circulating cytokine profiles, purinergic signaling and atrial cardiomyopathy findings in tissue samples.
