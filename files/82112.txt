An Open-Label Study of E7974 Administered on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-Day Cycle and Days 1 and 8 of a 21-Day Cycle in Patients With Solid Malignancies
The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of E7974 administered as an intravenous bolus dose on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle (Arm A) or on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle (Arm B) to patients with solid tumors that have progressed following effective therapy or for which no effective therapy exists.
Solid Tumor Malignancies, Cancer
DRUG: E7974|DRUG: E7974
Determine the maximum tolerated dose of E7974 in patients with solid malignancies., Duration of each cycle will be 28 or 21 days; patients will attend a follow-up visit 30 days after last study treatment. Follow-up for safety and efficacy will occur 6 months after the last patient is accrued to the study.
1) Assess E7974 for safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD); 2) Evaluate the correlation of AUC with clinical toxicity and efficacy in both arms., Duration of each cycle will be 28 or 21 days; patients will attend a follow-up visit 30 days after last study treatment. Follow-up for safety and efficacy will occur 6 months after the last patient is accrued to the study.
This is a two-arm, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation study to determine the MTD of E7974 administered as an intravenous bolus dose on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle (Arm A) or on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle (Arm B) to patients with solid tumors that have progressed following effective therapy or for which no effective therapy exists. Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.
