ABT-751 in Treating Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer That Did Not Respond to Hormone Therapy
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as ABT-751, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of ABT-751 and to see how well it works in treating patients with metastatic prostate cancer that did not respond to hormone therapy.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: ABT-751
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), MTD is determined by the 3+3 study design, in which patients are enrolled in cohorts of 3. In any dose cohort, if 1 patient of 3 experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), three additional patients will be enrolled at the same dose level. Whenever \>=2 of 6 subjects experience a DLT, then the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been exceeded. The MTD is generally one dose below that at which DLT occurs in \>= 2 of 6 subjects in any given cohort., up to four weeks|Number of Patients Who Demonstrated Treatment Effectiveness Based on Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Response in Non-measurable Disease, Patients with a minimum 50% decline in PSA from pre-treatment baseline, confirmed by a second PSA 4 or more weeks later, measured in nanograms per milliliter of blood., after four weeks

Likewise, one participant can potentially have more than one event in various grades 1-5 which accounts for the difference in number of patients analyzed and total number in the worst-grade toxicity tables. Tables represent the number of patients with worst-grade toxicity at each of five grades (grade 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe, 4 = life-threatening or disabling, grade 5 = death)following NCI Common Toxicity Criteria, at 30 days after final treatment dose
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Evaluate the safety and efficacy of ABT-751 in patients with androgen-independent, hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and optimal phase II dose of this drug in these patients.

Secondary

* Determine the objective response rate (partial and complete response) in patients with measurable disease treated with this drug.
* Evaluate the effect of this drug on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response in patients with nonmeasurable disease.
* Determine the time to tumor progression in patients treated with this drug.
* Determine survival of patients treated with this drug.
* Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.

* Phase I: Patients receive oral ABT-751 twice daily on days 1-7 and 15-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of ABT-751 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Up to 50 additional patients may be treated at the recommended phase II dose (RPTD) which is the dose level at the maximally administered dose.

* Phase II: Patients receive ABT-751 at the MTD determined in phase I. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 53 patients will be accrued for this study.
