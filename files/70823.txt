A Study to See if we Can Predict How Your Liver Tumor or Liver Metastases Will Respond to Trans-Arterial Embolization (TAE)
The purpose of this study is to see if certain genes the tumor can help predict how the tumor will respond to Trans-Arterial Embolization (TAE). A gene is the basic physical and functional unit of heredity. Genes are made up of DNA; DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is the hereditary material in humans. Identifying a gene that can predict how liver tumors will respond to TAE will also help to determine if adjuvant therapy will be needed after TAE.

response, Response will be categorized using standard mRECIST criteria. Tumor response will be catalogued as follows:

Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of any intratumoral arterial enhancement in all target lesions.

Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of viable (enhancement in the arterial phase) target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of the diameters of target lesions.

Stable Disease (SD): Any cases that do not qualify for either partial response or progressive disease. Progressive Disease (PD): An increase of at least 20% in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of the of viable (enhancing) target lesions recorded since treatment started., within 4 weeks
