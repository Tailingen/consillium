Adult patients (18 years or older) with the inclusion diagnosis, AML (ICD-10 C92.0), between 1.1.2013 - 30.6.2020 were followed from the index date (first ever record of the inclusion diagnosis) until the end of follow-up (30.6.2020), or death. This study did not involve any contacts to patients.

The study inclusion period was changed from 1.1.2013 - 30.6.2020 specified in the protocol to 1.1.2016 - 30.6.2020 due to lack of medication data from pre-2016.
