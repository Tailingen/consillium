A Trial to Compare the Efficacy, Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Immunogenicity of HD204 to Avastin® in Advanced Non-squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Patients
In the SAMSON-2 study, the proposed biosimilar HD204 will be compared to its reference product EU-licensed Avastin®. The aim of the study is to demonstrate equivalence of HD204 and EU-licensed Avastin® in terms of efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity.

This is a randomised, double-blind, parallel group, equivalence, multicentre Phase III study in patients with metastatic or recurrent non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Standard efficacy parameters, safety profiles, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity will be compared between HD204 and bevacizumab.
