PolyImmune {Durvalumab (MEDI4736) and Tremelimumab} & Vaccine Orchestrated Treatment for Patients With Advanced/Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma
Reported in the 2018 NEJM (378; 1277) article, the combination of checkpoint inhibitors ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4 antibody) and nivolumab (anti-PD-1 antibody) phase III trial Checkmate 214 demonstrated statistically significant (P\<0.0001) improvement of overall response rate (ORR) at 42% (95% confidence interval (CI), 37-47%) compared to standard of care (SOC) sunitinib at 27% (95% CI, 22-31%) in treatment naïve advanced or metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). This study also showed increased survival benefit of Ipi+Nivo over sunitinib in the IMDC intermediate-poor risk ccRCC patients. Accordingly, the Ipi+Nivo was just approved by U.S. FDA in April 2018 for treating metastatic ccRCC. Hence, the investigators hypothesized that the combination of durvalumab and tremelimumab is similarly efficacious in advanced or metastatic RCC. Furthermore, the investigators also hypothesize that the administration of personalized neoantigen DNA vaccine will further enhance anti-tumor immune response in RCC.
Renal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Durvalumab|DRUG: Tremelimumab|DEVICE: TDS-IM v1.0 System|BIOLOGICAL: Neoantigen DNA Vaccine|PROCEDURE: Research blood draw
Safety of the combination of durvalumab & tremelimumab with or without neoantigen DNA vaccine when given to patients with renal cell carcinoma as measured by the percentage of patients with adverse events of grade 3 or higher, * As graded by the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0
* Only adverse events that are possibly, likely, or probably related to the drug or drug combinations, Completion of cycle 1 (4 weeks)
Response rate in patients with renal cell carcinoma treated with durvalumab and tremelimumab with or without neoantigen DNA vaccine by RECIST 1.1 as measured by percentage of patients with radiographic complete response or partial response, * Complete response: Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level.
* Partial response: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters, Through completion of treatment (estimated to be 32-36 weeks)|Rate of progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with renal cell carcinoma treated with durvalumab and tremelimumab with or without neoantigen DNA vaccine, * PFS defined as from time of randomization to time of progression or death due to any cause, whichever earlier and if no progression or death, to time of last follow up
* Progressive disease: At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions)., Through 6 months after completion of treatment (estimated to be 15 months)|Rate of overall survival (OS) in patients with renal cell carcinoma treated with durvalumab and tremelimumab with or without neoantigen DNA vaccine, -OS) defined as from time of randomization to time of death due to any cause and if patients are still alive at end of the study, to the time of last follow up, Through 6 months after completion of treatment (estimated to be 15 months)
