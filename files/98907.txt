Phase 3 Study of Nimotuzumab and Irinotecan as Second Line With Advanced or Recurrect Gastric and Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer
This study will evaluate overall survival of nimotuzumab in combination with irinotecan compared to irinotecan alone in subjects with EGFR overexpressed advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer.
Gastric Cancer|Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer
DRUG: Irinotecan|DRUG: Nimotuzumab
Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the death from any cause., Around 4.5 years after first subject randomization
Progression Free Survival, Progression Free Survival is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of progression or death from any cause, whichever comes first., Around 4.5 years after first subject randomization|Overall Response Rate, Overall Response Rate is defined as the proportion of subjects with CR or PR in the best overall response., Around 4.5 years after first subject randomization|Disease Control Rate, Disease Control Rate is defined as the proportion of subjects with CR, PR or SD in the best overall response., Around 4.5 years after first subject randomization|Incidence of adverse events, Incidence of adverse events using latest CTCAE version 4 including minor version, Around 4.5 years after first subject randomization
This randomized, open-label, Japan, Korea and Taiwan collaborative, phase 3 study will evaluate overall survival of nimotuzumab in combination with irinotecan compared to irinotecan alone in subjects with EGFR overexpressed advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer. Approximately 400 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive irinotecan (control group) or nimotuzumab and irinotecan (combination group). Nimotuzumab and/or irinotecan should be continued until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Nimotuzumab is administered at 400 mg once weekly as an intravenous infusion and irinotecan is administered at 150 mg/m2 once every 2 weeks as an intravenous infusion.
