Endocrine Response in Women With Invasive Lobular Breast Cancer
RATIONALE: Currently, adjuvant endocrine therapy often follows a "one-size-fits- all" approach, with most premenopausal women receiving tamoxifen, and most postmenopausal receiving aromatase inhibitor therapy. In current clinical practice, patients with invasive lobular carcinoma are treated no differently than patients with invasive ductal carcinoma based on the void of information specific to patients with this tumor type. Identification of a biological signal of tamoxifen and/or AI-resistance and/or fulvestrant-sensitivity in ILC patients would have dramatic implications for the future management of this breast cancer subtype.

PURPOSE: To study whether fulvestrant is more effective than anastrozole or tamoxifen in reducing Ki67 in ILC and whether that Ki67 reduction will correlate with alterations in expression of ER and ER-regulated genes. Differential Ki67 effect in this study will serve as a surrogate for outcome of ILC patients on endocrine therapy.

Primary Objective:

To determine the change from baseline to post-treatment Ki67 values in ER-positive, HER2-negative ILC tissue derived from postmenopausal women awaiting definitive surgery or further neoadjuvant treatment who are randomized to 21-24 days of neoadjuvant endocrine treatments with fulvestrant (two 250 mg IM injections given on day 1), anastrozole (1mg given orally daily), or tamoxifen (20mg given orally daily).

As a proliferation marker to measure the growth fraction of cells in human tumors, the expression of Ki67 is strongly associated with cell proliferation and used in routine pathology. pKi67 is well characterized at the molecular level and extensively used as a prognostic and predictive marker in cancer.

OBJECTIVES

Primary

To determine the change from baseline to post-treatment Ki67 values in ER-positive, HER2-negative ILC tissue derived from postmenopausal women awaiting definitive surgery or further neoadjuvant treatment who are randomized to 21-24 days of neoadjuvant endocrine treatments with fulvestrant (two 250 mg IM injections given on day 1), anastrozole (1mg given orally daily), or tamoxifen (20mg given orally daily).

Secondary

* To evaluate ER protein expression in ILC tissues at baseline and following neoadjuvant endocrine therapy.
* To evaluate PR protein expression in ILC tissues at baseline and following neo-adjuvant endocrine therapy.
* To evaluate ER-related and ILC-specific candidate gene mRNA expression in ILC tissues at baseline and following neoadjuvant endocrine therapy in an effort to identify biomarkers of endocrine response and putative drivers of endocrine resistance in ILC.
* To evaluate associations between changes in Ki67 in ILC tissues following neoadjuvant endocrine therapy with ER and PR protein expression, or ER and candidate gene mRNA expression at baseline and post-treatment.

Exploratory

* To evaluate DNA methylation in ILC tissues at baseline and following neo-adjuvant endocrine therapy.
* To evaluate associations between germline and somatic DNA sequence variants with changes in Ki67 in ILC tissues following neo-adjuvant endocrine therapy.
* To evaluate the activity of signaling pathways in ILC tissues by immunohistochemical or other protein analyses, such as histone modifications, at baseline and following neo-adjuvant endocrine therapy.
