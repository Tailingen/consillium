Induction Chemotherapy Followed By Chrono-chemotherapy Concurrent With IMRT Of Locally Advanced NPC Clinical Study
Comparing induction chemotherapy followed by cisplatin chrono-chemotherapy concurrent combined with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (chrono-chemotherapy group) with induction chemotherapy followed by cisplatin routine-chemotherapy concurrent combined with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (routine-chemotherapy group) in the treatment of locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma, observing the adverse reaction and effects of two groups,expected chrono-chemotherapy group can achieve lower toxicity, improve the curative effect, for the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma provides a more reasonable way.
