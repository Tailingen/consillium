Gemcitabine and Cisplatin Plus Sorafenib in Patients With Advanced Biliary Tract Carcinomas Naive to Systemic Therapy
The purpose of this study is to test an investigational combination of drugs for bile duct or gallbladder cancers.

Gemcitabine and cisplatin are two forms of chemotherapy commonly used in combination to treat bile duct and gallbladder cancers. We are looking to improve treatment results. We will attempt to do so by adding sorafenib (a type of monoclonal antibody) to your treatment plan. Sorafenib acts by attaching to blocking specific targets on cells. These targets may help the cancer cells grow and divide. This study will help answer the question of whether sorafenib is a helpful drug in patients with bile duct or gallbladder cancers when given with gemcitabine and cisplatin.

This study is a phase 2 study. The purpose of a phase 2 study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad, sorafenib in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin has on advanced bile duct and gallbladder cancers.
