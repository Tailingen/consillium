Long-term Outcomes of Early-stage Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Patients Treated with Radiotherapy Alone
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a malignant tumor primarily originating in the nasopharynx, commonly found in populations in southern China, certain regions of Asia, and North Africa. The main treatment for NPC is primarily radiotherapy, with some patients receiving combined chemotherapy. Early-stage NPC patients can achieve adequate tumor control with radiation therapy alone. Various studies report that the 5-year survival rate for very early-stage NPC exceeds 90%. However, some stage I patients experience local recurrence or distant metastasis after treatment, indicating treatment failure. This study aims to retrospectively analyze the factors contributing to treatment failure and prognostic factors in this group of early-stage NPC patients.

Overall Survival, Overall survival is an important indicator for assessing treatment efficacy, reflecting the impact of treatment on extending patient life. It is typically calculated by measuring the time from the start of treatment until the patient's death or loss to follow-up., The 5-year survival rate after surgery|Disease-Free Survival, Disease-free survival (DFS) refers to the period during which a patient remains free of disease recurrence following treatment. This indicator helps evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment, particularly in early-stage cancer patients, as it reflects the durability of tumor control. DFS is typically calculated by measuring the time from the end of treatment to the first occurrence of disease recurrence., Within 5 years after surgery|Local Control Rate, Local control rate refers to the effectiveness of treatment in managing the tumor at its primary site, reflecting the ability to prevent local recurrence. A high local control rate indicates that the treatment has successfully eradicated the tumor or effectively suppressed its growth, which is crucial for the prognosis of tumors such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma., Within 5 years after surgery
Recurrence Rate, Recurrence rate refers to the proportion of patients who experience tumor recurrence after treatment, encompassing both local recurrence and distant metastasis. This indicator aids in evaluating the overall effectiveness of the treatment and identifying potential prognostic factors, while also revealing differences between various treatment methods., Within 5 years after surgery|Metastasis Rate, Metastasis rate refers to the proportion of tumors that spread to other sites in the body. This indicator provides information about disease progression. A high metastasis rate may suggest more aggressive biological characteristics of the tumor and can influence the choice of treatment strategies., Within 5 years after surgery|Treatment-Related Adverse Events, Treatment-related adverse events refer to the side effects or complications that patients experience during the course of treatment. These events can affect the patient's quality of life and the continuity of treatment, making it crucial to understand their incidence and nature in order to assess the overall safety of the treatment., Within 5 years after surgery
