Safety of Dabigatran Etexilate in Blood Clot Prevention in Children
This open-label, single arm prospective cohort study will assess the safety of dabigatran etexilate in secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism in paediatric patients. Children from 0 to less than 18 years of age will be eligible to participate.
Venous Thromboembolism|Secondary Prevention
DRUG: dabigatran etexilate
Event-free Probability of Recurrence of Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) at 6 and 12 Months, The event-free probability of first recurrence of VTE were provided by Kaplan-Meier estimation with its 95% confidence intervals (CIs) at 6 and 12 months.

Patients who did not experience recurrent VTE at the time of analysis, dropped out from the trial early, were lost to follow-up, or had died from non-VTE related cause were considered as non-events and censored. On treatment period was from first DE administration to 3 days of residual effect period after last DE administration., At month 6 (Week 26) and 12 (Week 52) of on treatment period|Event-free Probability of Major or Minor (Including Clinically Relevant Non-major (CRNM)) Bleeding Events at 6 and 12 Months, The event-free probability of major or minor (including CRNM) bleeding event were provided by Kaplan-Meier estimation with its 95% confidence intervals (CIs) at 6 and 12 months.

Patients who did not experience major or minor (including CRNM) bleeding event at the time of analysis, dropped out from the trial early, were lost to follow-up, or had died from non-bleeding related cause were considered as non-events and censored. On treatment period was from first DE administration to 3 days of residual effect period after last DE administration., At month 6 (Week 26) and month 12 (Week 52) of on treatment period|Event-free Probability of Mortality Overall and Related to Thrombotic or Thromboembolic Events at 6 and 12 Months, The event-free probability of mortality overall and related to thrombotic or thromboembolic events were provided by Kaplan-Meier estimation with its 95% confidence intervals (CIs) at 6 and 12 months.

Patients who did not experience mortality overall and related to thrombotic or thromboembolic events at the time of analysis, dropped out from the trial early, were lost to follow-up, were considered as non-events and censored. On treatment period was from first DE administration to 3 days of residual effect period after last DE administration., At month 6 (Week 26) and 12 (Week 52) of on treatment period
Event-free Probability of Occurrence of Post-thrombotic Syndrome (PTS) at 6 and 12 Months, The event-free probability of PTS were provided by Kaplan-Meier estimation with its 95% confidence intervals (CIs) at 6 and 12 months. Patients who did not experience PTS at the time of analysis, dropped out from the trial early, were lost to follow-up, or had died from non-PTS related cause were considered as non-events and censored. On treatment period was from first DE administration to 3 days of residual effect period after last DE administration., At month 6 (Week 26) and 12 (Week 52) of on treatment period|Percentage of Participants With Dabigatran Etexilate (DE) Dose Adjustments During on Treatment Period, Percentage of participants with dabigatran etexilate dose adjustments during on treatment period. On treatment period was from first DE administration to 3 days of residual effect period after last DE administration., From first DE administration to 3 days of residual effect period after last DE administration, up to 52 weeks+ 3 days|Central Measurement of Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) at Visit 3 (After at Least Six Consecutive Dabigatran Etexilate (DE) Doses), At Visit 3 (day 4 after first dose of trial medication)|Central Measurement of Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) at Post-titration (After at Least 3 Days Following Any Dabigatran Etexilate (DE) Dose Adjustment), Pharmacodynamics (PD) samples were collected from first dose of trial medication at day 1 and day 4, 22, 43, 85, 127, 183, 239 and 295 until last dose at day 365 and at post-titration (at least 3 days after dose adjustment) if needed, up to 365 days.|Central Measurement of Ecarin Clotting Time (ECT) at Visit 3 (After at Least Six Consecutive Dabigatran Etexilate (DE) Doses), At Visit 3 (day 4 after first dose of trial medication)|Central Measurement of Ecarin Clotting Time (ECT) at Post-titration (After at Least 3 Days Following Any Dabigatran Etexilate (DE) Dose Adjustment), Pharmacodynamics (PD) samples were collected from first dose of trial medication at day 1 and day 4, 22, 43, 85, 127, 183, 239 and 295 until last dose at day 365 and at post-titration (at least 3 days after dose adjustment) if needed, up to 365 days.|Central Measurement of Diluted Thrombin Time (dTT) at Visit 3 (After at Least Six Consecutive Dabigatran Etexilate (DE) Doses), At Visit 3 (day 4 after first dose of trial medication)|Central Measurement of Diluted Thrombin Time (dTT) at Post-titration (After at Least 3 Days Following Any Dabigatran Etexilate (DE) Dose Adjustment), dTT values were collected at day 4, 22, 43, 85, 127, 183, 239, and 295 until last dose at day 365 and at post-titration (at least 3 days after dose adjustment) if needed, up to 365 days.
