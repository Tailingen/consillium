Comparative Study of Sensitivity of Ga-DOTATOC PET vs Octreoscan SPECT + CT
This clinical trial studies gallium Ga 68-edotreotide positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) compared with indium In 111 pentetreotide plus contrast-enhanced CT (or MRI) in diagnosing patients with neuroendocrine tumors and other somatostatin receptor positive tumors. Diagnostic procedures, such as gallium Ga 68-edotreotide PET/CT, may help find and diagnose somatostatin receptor positive neuroendocrine tumors. It is not yet known whether Ga 68-edotreotide PET/CT is as effective as indium In 111 pentetreotide plus contrast-enhanced CT (or MRI) in diagnosis and staging of patients with neuroendocrine tumors.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To compare efficacy of \[68Ga\]-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide (68Ga-DOTATOC) (gallium Ga 68-edotreotide) PET/CT with Octreoscan (indium In 111 pentetreotide) + high-resolution, contrast-enhanced CT for diagnosis and staging in patients with somatostatin receptor expressing tumors.

OUTLINE:

Patients receive gallium Ga 68-edotreotide intravenously (IV) and undergo PET/CT scan. Within 120 days, patients undergo standard indium In 111 pentetreotide contrast-enhanced CT or MRI scan. Patients may also undergo a second gallium Ga 68-edotreotide PET/CT scan within 3-6 months if the lesions of the first scan cannot be confirmed.
