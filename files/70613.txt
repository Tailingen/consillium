A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Tolerability of BMS-986408 Alone and in Combination With Nivolumab or Nivolumab and Ipilimumab in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
The primary purpose of this study is to characterize the safety profile of BMS-986408 as monotherapy and in combination with nivolumab or nivolumab and ipilimumab to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) that optimizes the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship of BMS-986408 will also be determined.
