SRT for Residual Oligometastases of NSCLC After 3rd Generation EGFR-TKIs
This study is an open-label, single-arm phase 2 trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) for patients with oligo-residual NSCLC after 3rd generation EGFR-TKIs.
NSCLC Stage IV|EGFR Activating Mutation
DRUG: 3rd generation EGFR-TKI|RADIATION: Consolidative SRT
Progression Free Survival, PFS was measured from the date of enrollment to the date of disease progression as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) Version 1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. For patients whose disease did not progress, PFS was evaluated by censoring patients at their most recent imaging., Two years
Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events, Treatment-related adverse events were assessed and graded according to CTCAE v. 5.0., Two years|Overall Survival, OS was defined as the time from the date of enrollment until death by any cause. Participants still alive at the time of data analysis were censored at the date of last follow-up., Two years
