A Study of TQB2450 or Placebo Combined With Anlotinib, Etoposide and Carboplatin Versus Etoposide and Carboplatin in Subjects With Extensive Small Cell Lung Cancer (ETER701)
A randomized, double-blind, controlled, multicenter phase III study of TQB2450 or placebo combined with Anlotinib, etoposide and carboplatin versus Etoposide and Carboplatin in subjects with extensive small cell lung cancer. The primary outcome measures include PFS and OS. Extended stage Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) patients will be registered, after signing the informed consent, and then centrally randomized 1:1:1 to the experimental arms and the control arm.

Progression free survival (PFS), PFS defined as the time from randomization until the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause., up to 12 months|Overall survival (OS), OS defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause. Participants who do not die at the end of the extended follow-up period, or were lost to follow-up during the study, were censored at the last date they were known to be alive., up to 24 months
Overall response rate (ORR), Percentage of Participants Achieving Complete Response (CR) and Partial Response (PR) ., up to 12 months|Disease control rate (DCR), Percentage of Participants Achieving Complete Response (CR) and Partial Response (PR) and Stable Disease (SD)., up to 12 months|Duration of response（DOR）, For participants who demonstrate CR or PR, DOR is defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., up to 12 months|PFS rate of 6 and 12 months progression-free survival, PFS rate of progression-free survival at 6 and 12 months: the percentage of subjects who did not develop disease progression or die of any cause at 6 and 12 months after randomization., up to 12 months|OS rate of 12 and 18 months total survival, Total survival OS rate at 12 and 18 months: the proportion of subjects who died of any cause at 12 and 18 months after randomization., up to 12 months|Quality of life score, up to 12 months|Incidence and severity of adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE), Security Index, up to 24 months
