A Study to Evaluate Subjects Treated With rhuMab 2C4 (Pertuzumab) in a Previous Genentech Phase II Cancer Study
This is a multicenter, open label extension study. Subjects who have completed treatment in the parent study of pertuzumab, either alone or with a combination agent, and who received at least one dose of pertuzumab in the parent study are eligible for inclusion in this trial if they are continuing to receive clinical benefit.
Solid Cancers
DRUG: Pertuzumab
Percentage of Participants Who Experienced an Adverse Event, Baseline to the end of the study (up to 2 years, 5 months)
Percentage of Participants With a Best Overall Response of Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), Stable Disease (SD), or Progressive Disease (PD), A best overall response could occur at any time during the study and was determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). A CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions (TL) or the disappearance of all non-TLs and normalization of tumor marker level. A PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (SLD) of TLs, taking as reference the baseline SLD. SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for a PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest SLD since the treatment started for TLs and the persistence of 1 or more non-TL(s) and/or the maintenance of tumor marker level above normal limits. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the SLD of TLs, taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-TLs., Baseline to the end of the study (up to 2 years, 5 months)
