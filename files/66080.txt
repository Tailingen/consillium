Safety study of RC198 in Subjects with Solid Tumors.
Melanoma|Urothelial Carcinoma|Renal Cell Carcinoma|Non-small Cell Lung Cancer|Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma|Colorectal Carcinoma
DRUG: RC198 Injection
MTD based on number of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be assessed based on the number of patients experiencing DLTs, graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) v5.0., First 4 weeks (28 days) after first dose of study drug|Determine Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D), The RP2D may be selected based on the MTD following consultation with the safety monitoring committee with all available data., Informed consent through 28 days after the last dose of study drug|Incidence of Adverse Events [Safety and tolerability], The adverse events occurring or worsening on or after the first dose of the study drug will be recorded., Informed consent through 28 days after the last dose of study drug
Time to maximum serum concentration [Tmax], Tmax of RC198, Day 1- Day 5 of Week 1 and Week 4, Day 1 of Week 2, Week 3, Week 5 and Week 6 during cycle 1, and Day 1 of Week 1 and Week 4 during subsequent cycles, and EOT (7 days within subject discontinued study drug)|Area under the serum concentration verus time curve [AUC], AUC of RC198, Day 1- Day 5 of Week 1 and Week 4, Day 1 of Week 2, Week 3, Week 5 and Week 6 during cycle 1, and Day 1 of Week 1 and Week 4 during subsequent cycles, and EOT (7 days within subject discontinued study drug)|Maximum serum Concentration [Cmax], Cmax of RC198, Day 1- Day 5 of Week 1 and Week 4, Day 1 of Week 2, Week 3, Week 5 and Week 6 during cycle 1, and Day 1 of Week 1 and Week 4 during subsequent cycles, and EOT (7 days within subject discontinued study drug)|Immunogenicity of RC198, Incidence of anti-drug antibody (ADA) against RC198, D1 of W1 and W3 during cycle 1, and D1 of W1 during subsequent cycles, and EOT (7 days within subject discontinued study drug)|Object Response Rate (ORR), ORR will be determined according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) v1.1. The ORR is defined as the number of patients are either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), relative to the number of patients belonging to the study of interest, Screening, then every 6 weeks (±7 days) after Day 1 of Cycle 1 Week 1 until 14 days after the last dose of the study drug. Assessed up to 24 months.|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is the proportion of patients with disease control., Screening, then every 6 weeks (±7 days) after Day 1 of Cycle 1 Week 1 until 14 days after the last dose of the study drug. Assessed up to 24 months.|Duration of response (DoR), DoR is defined, for patients with response, as the time from first documentation of response (CR or PR) to the date of first documentation of progression of disease or death due to any causes whichever occurs first., From first partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) until disease progression or death, whichever occurs first. Assessed up to 24 months.|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of first administration to the date of the first documentation of progressive disease or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., From the first dose until documented disease progression or death, whichever occurs first. Assessed up to 24 months.
This is a Phase 1, first-in-human, open-label study to determine the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of RC198 in subjects with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic solid tumors for whom standard therapy does not exist, is no longer effective, or is not acceptable.
