A Safety Study of EPC2407, A Anti-Cancer Drug With Vascular Disrupting Activity: In Patients With Advanced Cancer
This study will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamic effects of a novel anti-cancer drug, EPC2407, administered to patients with advanced cancer which have not responded to or have recurred following treatment with available therapies
Advanced Cancer
DRUG: EPC2407 (crinobulin)
Safety, Duration of drug exposure
This is a Phase I, open label, multicenter, dose-escalation, safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic study of EPC2407 administered intravenously over 60 minutes on a QDx3 schedule repeated every 21 days. Patients are enrolled and dosed at the level defined by the escalation scheme. The primary goal of the study design is to assess toxicity at the fixed dose levels according to the modified Fibonacci schema.
