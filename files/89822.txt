Androgen Suppression Combined With Nodal Irradiation and Dose Escalated Prostate Treatment
This study is being done to answer the following question: Is the strategy to give higher doses of radiotherapy treatment over a shorter period of time using special equipment and fewer treatments (also known as Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy or SBRT) as effective as usual external radiation therapy given with a brachytherapy boost (which involves radiation sources inserted directly into the prostate)?

The usual approach for patients with unfavourable prostate cancer who are not in a study is treatment with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) to the pelvis and prostate in combination with hormone therapy (androgen deprivation therapy - ADT). To improve control of prostate cancer at risk of returning, additional treatment with a brachytherapy boost (insertion of radiation sources directly into the prostate) is recommended. For patients who get the usual approach for this cancer, about 89 out of 100 are free of cancer after 5 years.
