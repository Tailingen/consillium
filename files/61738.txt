Study of Nivolumab (BMS-936558) in Combination With Gemcitabine/Cisplatin, Pemetrexed/Cisplatin, Carboplatin/Paclitaxel, Bevacizumab Maintenance, Erlotinib, Ipilimumab or as Monotherapy in Subjects With Stage IIIB/IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) (CheckMate 012)
* The study is evaluating the safety and tolerability of Nivolumab (BMS-936558) when combined with three platinum-based doublet chemotherapy regimens (Cisplatin/Gemcitabine; Cisplatin/Pemetrexed; and Carboplatin/Paclitaxel) in subjects with NSCLC.
* The study is evaluating the safety and tolerability of Nivolumab as maintenance therapy in combination with Bevacizumab/Avastin that will be given after at least 4 cycles of platinum doublet chemotherapy.
* The study is evaluating the safety and tolerability of Nivolumab in combination with Erlotinib among epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation positive non-squamous NSCLC subjects and as monotherapy in subjects with NSCLC.
* The study is evaluating the safety and tolerability of Nivolumab in combination with Ipilimumab in subjects with squamous and non-squamous NSCLC.
* The study is evaluating the safety and tolerability of Nivolumab as switch maintenance therapy in subjects with squamous and non-squamous NSCLC.
* The study is evaluating the safety and tolerability of Nivolumab as monotherapy among subjects with untreated, asymptomatic brain metastases and no evidence of cerebral edema.

Number of Participants Who Experienced Serious Adverse Events (SAE), Adverse Events (AE) Leading to Discontinuation, or Death, AE=any new unfavorable symptom, sign, or disease or worsening of a preexisting condition that may not have a causal relationship with treatment. SAE=a medical event that at any dose results in death, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or drug dependency/abuse; is life-threatening, an important medical event, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or requires or prolongs hospitalization. Treatment-related=having certain, probable, possible, or missing relationship to study drug. Grade (Gr) 1=Mild, Gr 2=Moderate, Gr 3=Severe, Gr 4= Potentially Life-threatening or disabling., From first dose to 30 days after the last dose of study drug (assessed up to July 2016, approximately 55 months)|Number of Participants Who Experienced Selected Adverse Events, The number of participants who experienced an AE of interest due to any cause is presented. Endocrine, Gastrointestinal, Hepatic, Pulmonary, Renal, Skin, and

Hypersensitivity/Infusion select AEs were identified that are potentially associated with the use of nivolumab, based on the following 4 guiding principles:

* AEs that may differ in type, frequency, or severity from AEs caused by non-immunotherapies
* AEs that may require immunosuppression (eg, corticosteroids) as part of their management
* AEs whose early recognition and management may mitigate severe toxicity
* AEs for which multiple event terms may be used to describe a single type of AE, thereby necessitating the pooling of terms for full characterization., From first dose to 30 days after the last dose of study drug (assessed up to July 2016, approximately 55 months)|Number of Participants With Abnormalities in Selected Hepatic Clinical Laboratory Tests, The number of subjects with selected hepatic laboratory abnormalities is reported.

AST= aspartate aminotransferase; ALT= alanine aminotransferase; ULN= upper limit of normal., From first dose to 30 days following last dose of study drug (assessed up to July 2016, approximately 55 months)|Number of Participants With Abnormalities in Selected Thyroid Clinical Laboratory Tests, The number of subjects with selected thyroid laboratory abnormalities is reported. FT3 and FT4 test abnormalities were considered for a 2-week window after the abnormal TSH test date.

TSH= thyroid-stimulating hormone; FT3= Free T3; FT4= Free T4; LLN= lower limit of normal; ULN= upper limit of normal, From first dose to 30 days following last dose of study drug (assessed up to July 2016, approximately 55 months)
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the percentage of all treated participants who achieved a Best Overall Response (BOR) of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 criteria as per investigator assessment. This proportion was multiplied by 100 and expressed as a percentage. BOR was defined as the best response designation recorded between the date of randomization and the date of progression, or the date of subsequent anticancer therapy, whichever occurred first. CR or PR determinations included in the BOR assessment were confirmed by a second scan at least 4 weeks after the criteria for responses were first met. For participants without progression or subsequent therapy, all available response designations contributed to the BOR determination. For participants who continued treatment beyond progression, the BOR was determined based on response designations recorded up to the time of the initial progression., From first dose until date of progression or subsequent anti-cancer therapy (assessed up to July 2016, approximately 55 months)|Progression-Free Survival Rate (PFSR) at Week 24, Progression-Free Survival (PFS) was defined as the time from the date of first dose of study medication to the date of first disease progression or death, if death occurred within 100 days of the final dose of study drug. Among participants without previous RECIST-defined progression, participants who died beyond 100 days and those who remained alive were censored at the last tumor assessment date (before subsequent therapy).

PFSR at week 24 was defined as the proportion of subjects remaining progression free and surviving at 24 weeks. The proportion was calculated by the product-limit method (Kaplan-Meier estimate), which takes into account censored data, and expressed as a percentage., 24 weeks
