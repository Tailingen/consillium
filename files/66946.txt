Phase 2 Study to Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of Cretostimogene Grenadenorepvec in High-Risk NMIBC
This is a Phase 2, Multi-Arm, Multi-Cohort, Open-Label Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Cretostimogene Grenadenorepvec in Participants with High-Risk Non-Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer.
High-Risk Non-Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer
DRUG: Cretostimogene Grenadenorepvec
Cohort A (Arm 1 and 2): Complete response rate, Determine the complete response rate at any time following treatment with cretostimogene in participants with BCG-na誰ve CIS with or without concomitant high-grade Ta or T1 disease at baseline, At 11 and 24 weeks|Cohort A (Arm 3): High- Grade Event-Free Survival, Determine the High-Grade Event-Free Survival following treatment with cretostimogene in participants with BCG-na誰ve HG Ta/T1 disease without concomitant CIS at baseline., 48 months|Cohort B (Arm 1): Complete response rate, Determine the complete response rate at any time following treatment with cretostimogene in participants with BCG-exposed CIS with or without concomitant high-grade Ta or T1 disease at baseline., At 11 and 24 weeks|Cohort B (Arm 2): High-Grade Event-Free Survival, Determine the High-Grade Event-Free Survival following treatment with cretostimogene in participants with BCG-exposed high-grade Ta/T1 papillary disease without CIS at baseline., 48 months|Cohort CX (Arms 1 and 2): High-Grade Event-Free Survival, Determine the High-Grade Event-Free Survival following treatment with cretostimogene in participants with BCG-exposed or BCG-unresponsive high-grade NMIBC., 48 months|Cohort CX (Arms 1 and 2): Safety, Determine the safety of concurrent cretostimogene and gemcitabine and sequential cretostimogene and gemcitabine., 48 months
Cohort A (Arms 1 and 2): Evaluate cretostimogene instillation methods, Evaluate cretostimogene genome and GM-CSF levels, treatment efficacy, and safety by 2 different methods of cretostimogene instillation in participants with pathologically confirmed CIS-containing high-risk NMIBC who are na誰ve to BCG treatment., At 11 and 24 weeks|Cohort A (Arm 3): High-Grade Event-Free Survival at 12 months, Determine the proportion of participants with BCG-naive papillary-only high-grade NMIBC at baseline who are free from high-grade events at 12 months, At 12 months|Cohort A (Arms 1 and 2) and Cohort B (Arm 1) Duration of response, Assess duration of response in participants with CIS with or without concomitant HG Ta/T1 disease at baseline, 48 months|Cohort B (Arm 2) High-Grade Event-Free Survival at 12 months, Determine the proportion of participants with BCG-exposed papillary-only high-grade NMIBC at baseline who are free from high-grade events at 12 months, At 12 months|Cohort CX (Arm 1 and 2) Complete response rate, Determine the complete response rate at any time following treatment with cretostimogene and gemcitabine in participants with BCG-exposed or BCG-unresponsive CIS with or without concomitant high-grade Ta or T1 disease at baseline., At 11 and 24 weeks
In Cohort A, up to 125 participants will be enrolled with pathologically confirmed, high-risk high-grade non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) NMIBC (i.e., CIS with or without concomitant Ta or T1 disease OR HG Ta/T1 disease without CIS) which is na誰ve to Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) treatment. Participants with CIS with or without concomitant Ta/T1 NMIBC at baseline will be randomized 1:1 to receive cretostimogene via the current (Arm 1) or an alternative instillation procedure (Arm 2). Participants with papillary-only high-risk NMIBC (i.e., HG Ta/T1 without CIS) at baseline (Arm 3) will receive cretostimogene via the alternative instillation procedure.

In Cohort B, up to 150 participants will be enrolled with pathologically confirmed, high-risk high-grade NMIBC (i.e., CIS with or without concomitant Ta or T1 disease OR HG Ta/T1 disease without CIS) which has previously been exposed to BCG treatment. Participants with CIS-containing pathology at baseline will be recruited into Arm 1 and participants with papillary-only pathology at baseline will be recruited into Arm 2. Both Cohort B Arms 1 and 2 will receive cretostimogene via the alternative instillation procedure.

In Cohort CX, up to 50 participants will be enrolled with pathologically confirmed, high-risk high-grade NMIBC (i.e., CIS with or without concomitant Ta or T1 disease OR HG Ta/T1 disease without CIS) which has previously been exposed to or is unresponsive to BCG treatment. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive cretostimogene and gemcitabine either concurrently or sequentially.

In all cohorts, study treatment will be administered as a weekly induction course for the first 6 weeks with a reinduction course administered to patients who have CIS and/or high-grade Ta disease at the 3-month evaluation. Following induction, if no high-grade disease is detected, maintenance treatment will begin. This consists of a cycle of three weekly treatments every three months during the first year, and every six months during the second year, with an optional extension to the third year following the same six-month schedule.

Disease status will be assessed using urine cytology, complete bladder visualization (e.g., cystoscopy), upper tract assessment and directed resection/biopsy (if indicated) every 3 months for the first 2 years and then every 6 months for a further 2 years or until disease recurrence.
