DRUG: 18F-fluoro-dihydroxyphenylalanine|PROCEDURE: Positron emission tomography (PET)|PROCEDURE: Computed tomography (CT)|PROCEDURE: Magnetic resonance imaging
Number of Suspicious Lesions Identified by 18F FDOPA PET, The number of suspicious lesions will be identified by uptake of F18 FDOPA radiopharmaceutical using a positron emission tomography (PET) scan. Uptake of F-18 FDOPA is a measure of amino acid uptake and metabolism in tumors. Suspicious lesions will be visually identified by a board certified nuclear medicine physician., Up to 30 minutes after injection of F18 FDOPA|Percent Agreement of 18F FDOPA PET With Pathology, For the subset of lesions where pathology is available (mainly biopsied lesions), the accuracy of 18F FDOPA PET as percent agreement with pathology will be calculated. If the number of biopsy positive lesions is at least 10, an estimate of sensitivity will be calculate; if the number of biopsy negative lesions is at least 10 an estimate of specificity will be calculated., Up to 30 minutes post-injection (at time of scan)
This clinical trial compares fluorine F-18 fluoro-dihydroxyphenylalanine (18F-fluorodopa or 18F-FDOPA) positron emission tomography (PET) with standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in measuring tumors in patients with glioma that is newly diagnosed or recurrent (has returned). 18F-FDOPA is a radioactive drug that binds to tumor cells and is captured in images by PET. Computed tomography (CT) and MRI are used with PET to describe information regarding the function, location, and size of the tumor. PET/CT or PET/MRI may be more accurate than standard MRI in helping doctors find and measure brain tumors.
