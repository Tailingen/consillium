Immunological Response After Ablative Therapy in the Liver
Local ablative treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma is performed primary on patients not eligible for liver transplant or liver resection. At our Hospital two different methods are used: Microwave ablation, where the tumor cells are heated up and killed, and Irreversible electroporation, where the tumor cells are exposed to an electrical field and nano-pores are formed in the cell membranes and the cells go into apoptosis (programed cell death).

Previous studies have shown effects on the immune system after ablative therapies.

The purpose of this study is to compare the immunological response after the wo different methods of killing the tumor cells.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma|Immune Response
DEVICE: Microwave ablation|DEVICE: Irreversible electroporation
Immunological response, Change in immunological response, Change from baseline (morning of the procedure) measured at post operative day 1,7, 28 and 90
Number of participants with complete radiological response at follow up 3, 6, 9 and 12 months., Compare the effect of the two different ablative methods, Follow-up every three months for one year with CT scan.
