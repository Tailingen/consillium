LAG3 PET Imaging in Advanced Solid Tumors
This is an investigator-initiated, single-center, open-label clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and PK of the PET tracer 89Zr-DFO-REGN3767 in patients prior to and during treatment.
Metastatic Solid Tumor
OTHER: 89Zr-DFO-REGN3767|DRUG: Cemiplimab
Optimal 89Zr-DFO-REGN3767 dose and PET imaging timepoint, Determine the optimal 89Zr-DFO-REGN3767 dose and optimal PET imaging timepoint., 2 years|Pharmacokinetics (PK) of 89Zr-DFO-REGN3767, Description of PK of 89Zr-DFO-REGN3767 by measuring standardized uptake value (SUV) on PET scans performed 0, 2, 4 and/or 7 days after tracer injection., 2 years|Incidence of adverse events related to 89Zr-DFO-REGN3767 administration as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, Safety assessment through summaries of adverse events, changes in laboratory test results (if evaluation is indicated) and changes in vital signs. Adverse event data will be recorded and summarized according to NCI CTCAE v5.0, 2 years
Heterogeneity of 89Zr-DFO-REGN3767 antibody tumor uptake, Heterogeneity of 89Zr-DFO-REGN3767 uptake will be evaluated by measuring standardized uptake value (SUV) in defined volumes of interest (VOIs) of tumor lesions on the PET scan images., 2 years|Correlation of tumor tracer uptake with tumor and immune cell LAG3 expression, Results of immunohistochemical (IHC) scoring of immune cell LAG3 expression will be described as a semi-quantitative score using the percentage of positive cells (continuous variable), intensity and pattern of staining (discrete variable). These IHC results will be compared with imaging tracer standardized uptake value (SUV) in defined volumes of interest (VOIs) of tumor lesions on the PET scan images., 2 years|Correlation of tumor tracer uptake with response to cemiplimab, Response to therapy with cemiplimab (with or without chemotherapy) will be assessed according to the RECIST or iRECIST guidelines. These results will be compared with imaging tracer standardized uptake value (SUV) in defined volumes of interest (VOIs) of tumor lesions on the PET scan images., 2 years|Assessment of changes in tumor and normal organ uptake, Patients enrolled in part B will undergo a PET scan at baseline and another one after 2 treatment cycles. 89Zr-DFO-REGN3767 tracer uptake will be quantified and expressed as standardized uptake value (SUV) in defined volumes of interest (VOIs) for both scans. The results of both PET scans will be compared to assess changes in imaging tracer uptake over time., 2 years
