Analysis will be conducted in the subset of patients with any response., Baseline, up to 5 years|Clinical benefit rate (CBR), CBR is defined as proportion of patients with complete or partial remission for best response or with stable disease lasting for at least 24 weeks., Baseline, up to 5 years|Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) according to NCI CTCAE, Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) as characterized by type, frequency, severity and seriousness, Baseline, up to 30 days after end of tucatinib treatment|Safety laboratory value: Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), During tucatinib administration, safety laboratory will be performed according to routine clinical practice. Laboratory values of AST (Aspartate aminotransferase) measured will be documented continously during tucatinib treatment. Baseline levels of AST will be presented using descriptive statistics., Baseline, up to 30 days after end of tucatinib treatment|Safety laboratory value: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), During tucatinib administration, safety laboratory will be performed according to routine clinical practice. Laboratory values of ALT (Alanine aminotransferase) measured will be documented continously during tucatinib treatment. Baseline levels of ALT will be presented using descriptive statistics., Baseline, up to 30 days after end of tucatinib treatment|Safety laboratory value: bilirubin, During tucatinib administration, safety laboratory will be performed according to routine clinical practice. Laboratory values of bilirubin measured will be documented continously during tucatinib treatment. Baseline levels of bilirubin will be presented using descriptive statistics., Baseline, up to 30 days after end of tucatinib treatment|Therapy decision making, Frequencies and percentages of parameters affecting therapy choice., Baseline|Previous antineoplastic Therapies, Frequency/type of previous systemic antineoplastic treatments (neoadjuvant/adjuvant/palliative), Baseline|Previous anti-HER2 regimens, Frequency and type of previous anti-HER2 based regimens, Baseline|Subsequent antineoplastic therapies, Frequency and type of subsequent systemic antineoplastic therapies, End of treatment, up to 5 years|Local antineoplastic therapies, Frequency and type of local antineoplastic therapies (surgeries, radiotherapies) incl. local intracranial therapies, Baseline, up to 5 years|Details on line of treatment for both cohorts, Cohort 1: frequencies and percentages for line of treatment (1st-line or 2nd-line tucatinib treatment) Cohort 2: frequencies and percentages for line of treatment (3rd-line or 4th-line tucatinib treatment), Baseline|Treatment Duration, Treatment duration of study treatment in total and per substance, Baseline, up to 5 years|Dose intensity, Dose intensity (absolute and relative) for each substance as prescribed by the treating physician, Baseline, up to 5 years|Dose modifications, Frequency, type and reasons of dose modifications (dose reductions, skipped administrations/delays/interruption) compared to SmPC of tucatinib for each substance., Baseline, up to 5 years|Therapy management (use of relevant supportive medications), Frequency of usage of antidiarrheal drugs for prophylaxis and treatment of tucatinib-induced diarrhea, Baseline, up to 5 years
Number of planned hospitalizations, Number of planned hospitalizations will be measured using descriptive statistics., Baseline, up to 5 years|Duration of planned hospitalizations, Duration of planned hospitalizations will be measured using descriptive statistics., Baseline, up to 5 years|Duration of sick leaves, Duration of sick leaves will be measured using descriptive statistics., Baseline, up to 5 years
TRACE will collect real-world data on the treatment of tucatinib/trastuzumab/capecitabine in a broad patient population including older patients and patients with more comorbidities as compared to the pivotal trial HER2CLIMB. In contrast to HER2CLIMB, TRACE will also include patients receiving tucatinib/trastuzumab/capecitabine during 1st and 2nd palliative therapy line who were primarily diagnosed with early breast cancer and therefore already have received two prior anti-HER2 based treatment regimens before enrollment. Until today, no reliable data is available for these patient population. TRACE will primarily focus on HRQoL using the validated EORTC QLQ C30 + QLQ-BR23 + EQ-5D-5L questionnaires. Further aims are to evaluate effectiveness and safety in distinct subgroups focusing on effectiveness of tucatinib/trastuzumab/capecitabine in patients who have experienced prior therapies with trastuzumab and neratinib or capecitabine and HER2-targeted TKIs in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant or palliative setting, respectively.

Study sites may retrospectively include patients within 9 weeks (corresponds to 3 cycles) after start of study treatment up to 6 months after activation of respective site. Retrospectively included patients may have already completed study treatment or may have already deceased at the time of inclusion.
