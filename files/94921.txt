Immunization With a Pentavalent Vaccine Composed of KLH-conjugates of GD2L, GD3L, Globo H, Fucosyl GM1, and N-Propionylated Polysialic Acid
Even when small cell lung cancer responds well to treatment with chemotherapy, it has a tendency to grow back and to spread. The investigators are interested in testing new therapies aimed at decreasing this risk. This study tests a vaccine, which is a substance injected under the skin which can cause an immune response. The hope is that the body will make antibodies to the vaccine which will also react against the cancer. The vaccine is specific for small cell lung cancer. It combines several components (small cell lung cancer targets) that have been tested individually in patients with small cell lung cancer or other cancers (GD2, GD3, Globo H, Fucosyl GM1 and N-propionylated polysialic acid). Two other substances (KLH and OPT-821) are added which boost the immune system.

This study will have two groups of patients. The first group will receive the vaccines along with one cycle of chemotherapy. The second group will receive the vaccines without chemotherapy.
Lung Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: vaccine comprised of KLH conjugates of GD2L, GD3L, Globo H, fucosyl GM1, and N-propionylated polysialic acid plus OPT-821 adjuvant|BIOLOGICAL: Biological/Vaccine: vaccine comprised of KLH conjugates of GD2L, GD3L, Globo H, fucosyl GM1, and N-propionylated polysialic acid plus OPT-821 adjuvant
Confirm the safety of the pentavalent vaccine in this patient population, After immunization with a pentavalent vaccine, including KLH conjugates of GD2L, GD3L, Globo H, fucosyl GM1, and N-propionylated polysialic acid, with the adjuvant OPT-821. Toxicity will be graded in accordance with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0. The vaccination will be considered safe if no more than 1 patient has new grade 2 neurotoxicity, grade 3 hepatotoxicity, new autoimmunity or grade 4 local or grade 3 systemic toxicity requiring cessation of treatment., 1 year|Confirm the immunogenicity of the pentavalent vaccine in this patient population, an antibody titer of \> or = to 1:80 by ELISA against a given antigen or an ELISA titer \> or = to 8 fold increase over baseline for patients with a detectable baseline titer; ) confirmation by FACS against tumor cells expressing the four antigens. An increase in percent positive cells by FACS by 3-fold (over 30%) compared to pretreatment level, with the pretreatment level set at 10%, is a positive FACS response., 1 year
To measure the B-cell response at the cellular level, by generating and analyzing monoclonal antibodies against GD2L, GD3L, Globo H, Fucosyl GM1, and NPropionylated Polysialic Acid and to compare the avidity of the induced antigen specific IgG and IgM antibodies which is not possible with sera, 1 year|To evaluate the use of a circulating tumor cell (CTC) assay in this patient population., with minimal residual disease to determine if levels correlate with recurrence., 1 year
