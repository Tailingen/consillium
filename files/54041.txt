Biodistribution&Pharmacokinetic of Position Emission Tomography(PET) Radiopharmaceutical 18F C SNAT4
Primary Objectives

* Determine the biodistribution of \[18F\]-C-SNAT4 in 5 healthy volunteers. Secondary Objectives
* Determine the dosimetry of \[18F\]-C-SNAT4 PET in healthy volunteers and patients with lung cancer.
* Determine the acute toxicity of \[18F\]-C-SNAT4 PET in healthy volunteers and patients with lung cancer.
* Determine whether uptake in \[18F\]-C-SNAT4 PET imaging is significantly different in tumor and corresponding contralateral noncancer tissue in patients with lung cancer (tested by Wilcoxon test) before the therapy.
* Determine/verify the safety profile of the \[18F\]-C-SNAT4 radiotracer, as an imaging agent in patients with lung cancer.
* Determine the time of maximal \[18F\]-C-SNAT4 radiotracer uptake post injection.

DRUG: 18F-C-SNAT4|DEVICE: Positron emission tomography (PET)/Computed tomography (CT) Scan
Biodistribution of [18F]-C-SNAT4, Whole-body \[18F\]-C-SNAT4 PET scans will be performed at 60 min post intravenous injection of the PET tracer in Group 1 of 5 healthy volunteers, 1 day
Dosimetry of [18F]-C-SNAT4, Radiation dosimetry of the \[18F\]-C-SNAT4 radiotracer will be measured through careful monitoring of each participant's vital signs in Group 1 and group 2. Time-Activity curves will be graphed by measuring activity in various organs using multiple PET/CT scans (1 hour dynamic scan, 1 hour and 2 hours) after tracer injection. Absorbed radiation will be calculated., 1 day|Toxicity of [18F]-C-SNAT4, The acute \[18F\]-C-SNAT4 toxicity will be assessed as related adverse events, including laboratory abnormalities, that occur within 7 days of the infusion of \[18F\]-C-SNAT4., 7 days|18F]-C-SNAT4 Uptake, The tumor uptake of \[18F\]-C-SNAT4 PET will be compared with the corresponding contralateral non-cancer tissue in patients with lung cancer before the therapy in Group 2 and 3. SUVmax measurements will be taken from the pre-treatment scan., 1 day|The Maximal [18F]-C-SNAT4 Uptake as PET Radiotracer, The time of maximal \[18F\]-C-SNAT4 radiotracer uptake post-injection will be assessed in Group 2 and 3. Time-Activity Curves (TAC) will be graphed by measuring activity in tumor after tracer injection. The maximal of \[18F\]-C-SNAT4 radiotracer uptake post-injection in lung cancer patients will be determined from these time activity curves., 1 day|[18F]-C-SNAT4 PET Imaging Signal in Responders and Non-responders, The \[18F\]-C-SNAT4 PET scan signal from pre-therapy to one week after initiation of therapy in Group 3 will be compared both in treatment responders vs. non-responders. SUVmax will be measured in both the pre-treatment and one-week post-initiation of treatment scans., 7 days
