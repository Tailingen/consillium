Study of AZD5363 in Combination With Paclitaxel, in Advanced Gastric Adenocarcinoma Patients Harboring PIK3CA Mutation and/or PIK3CA Amplification as a Second-line Chemotherapy
This study is a single arm, single center phase II study of AZD5363 in combination with paclitaxel in patients with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma harboring PIK3CA mutation or amplification as a second line chemotherapy.

Patients will receive AZD 5363 plus weekly paclitaxel combination regimen. A arm is composed of 25 patients.

Tumour evaluation using RECIST 1.1 will be conducted at screening (within 28 days prior to first dose) and every 8 weeks relative to the date of enrollment, up to week 40, then every 16 weeks until objective disease progression (within a window of +/- 7 days of the scheduled date).

Study treatment will be continued until objective disease progression.

AZD5363 is a highly potent adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-competitive AKT inhibitor with IC50\<10nmol/l for all three AKT isoforms.

AZD5363 is well designed to inhibit the important main signal pathway in various human cancer. AZD5363 is a specific inhibitor of the AKT pathway which is activated in a wide spectrum of tumours.The combination of AZD5363 to standard chemotherapy, paclitaxel, might improve the outcomes of 2nd line therapy in advanced gastric cancer patients .
