Study of Allogeneic Double Negative T Cells (DNT-UHN-1) in Patients With High Risk Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This study aims to determine the safety and toxicity of incremental doses of Double Negative T (DNT) cells in human subjects with high risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML). DNT cells are mature T lymphocytes that comprise \~1% of white blood cells in humans. Injection of DNTs from healthy donors has been demonstrated to be effective against AML cells. DNT cells will be collected from healthy volunteers and injected into patients.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: DNT cells
Number of patients with adverse events and abnormal laboratory studies., Patients will be assessed for adverse events based upon, but not limited to, monitoring of vital signs and prescribed laboratory studies. Adverse events (AE) will use the descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). This study will utilize the CTCAE Version 4.03 for adverse event reporting., 2 years
Number of cells with disease specific mutations per patient, Quantitive real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis for disease specific mutations will be performed on the bone marrow aspirate., 2 years|Leukemia load, Peripheral blood will be obtained after DNT cell infusion to monitor leukemia load and residual disease by determining the frequency of leukemic cell markers on cells using flow cytometry., 2 years
