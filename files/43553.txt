Allogeneic CART-19 for Elderly Relapsed/Refractory CD19+ ALL
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficiency of allogeneic cluster of differentiation 19 (CD19)-directed chimeric antigen receptor modified T cells (CART-19) infusions in patients with relapsed / refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL)
Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: allogeneic CART-19
Occurrence of study related adverse events, defined as \>= Grade 3 signs/symptoms, laboratory toxicities, and clinical events) that are possibly, likely, or definitely related to study treatment Adverse events assessed according to NCI-CTCAE v4.0 criteria, 1 year
Overall response rate of allogeneic CART-19, An objective response is defined as: (1) a morphologic complete response (CR) or (2) a complete response with incomplete recovery of counts (CRi) (based on NCCN guidelines (National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), 2014) or (3) a negative minimal residual disease assessed by flow cytometry or qPCR, up to 24 weeks|Disease-free survival, up to 24 weeks|Overall survival, up to 24 weeks
The relapsed and/or refractory B-ALL patients will receive infusions of allogeneic CART-19 within 1 week after chemotherapy. The re-induction chemotherapy regimen was primarily vindesine, mitoxantrone, cyclophosphamide, pegaspargase and dexamethasone, and no graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prevention was conducted pre- and post- therapy.
