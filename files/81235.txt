Randomized Neoadjuvant Study of Epirubicin and Docetaxel With/Without Capecitabine in Early Breast Cancer
Primarily, this clinical investigation compares the rates (percentages) of pathological complete remissions attained at the time of final surgery following 6 cycles each of epirubicin + docetaxel + capecitabine-containing chemotherapy ± trastuzumab (in HER-2 positive disease) vs. epirubicin + docetaxel-containing chemotherapy ± trastuzumab (in HER-2 negative disease).
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Epirubicin|DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Capecitabine|DRUG: Trastuzumab
Rate of pathological complete remissions, at the time of final surgery after 6 cycles of Arm A (Epirubicin/ Docetaxel/ Capecitabine-containing chemotherapy ± Trastuzumab in HER-2 positive disease) vs. Arm B (Epirubicin/Docetaxel-containing chemotherapy ± Trastuzumab in HER-2 positive disease)., 20 weeks
Rates of axillary lymph node involvement and breast-conserving procedures, at the time of final surgery in Arm A (± trastuzumab in HER-2 positive disease) vs. Arm B (± trastuzumab in HER-2 positive disease)., 20 weeks
This study is a prospective, randomized, multicentre, phase III trial in the neoadjuvant treatment of patients with primary breast cancer and no distant metastases. Patients will be stratified at inclusion according to the centre, to the clinical tumour stage (T1, T2, T3, T4a-c), the axillary lymph node status (positive, negative), the menopausal status (pre-menopausal, post-menopausal), histology (invasive ductal, invasive lobular, mixed), the hormone-receptor status (positive \[ER+/PR+, ER+/PR-, ER-/PR+\], negative \[ER-/PR-\], not determinable\]), the HER-2 status (positive, negative, not determinable), the grading (G1/G2, G3, not determinable) and will be randomly assigned to receive either 6 cycles of neoadjuvant epirubicin, docetaxel and capecitabine ± trastuzumab in HER-2 positive disease or 6 cycles of neoadjuvant epirubicin and docetaxel ± trastuzumab in HER-2 positive disease.
