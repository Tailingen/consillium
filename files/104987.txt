Mycobiome Supporting Diet to Reduce GI Toxicity Associated With ASCT
The purpose of this study is to determine if this specific Mycobiome Supporting Diet (MSD diet) can help reduce gut inflammation during post-transplant period. The MSD is an special diet which will be explained in detail by a dietician that works by supporting the body's good gut bacteria and fungi.

BEHAVIORAL: Mycobiome Supporting Diet
Percent of participants with at least 2 out of 3 assessments marked "more than half the time" on compliance questionnaire, MSD adherence feasibility measured by percent of participants with at least 2 out of 3 assessments marked "more than half the time" on compliance questionnaire. The questionnaire includes a multiple choice questions about adherence to diet (4 levels, from 'not at all' to 'the whole time'), a multiple choice question identifying barriers to adherence, and 8 yes/no questions about medication use and symptom experience. The MSD diet will deem feasible if at least 80 percent of participants showed adherence defined by 2 out of 3 assessment marked "more than half the time"., 21 days prior to Transplant (an average of 1 month from start of study)|Percent of participants with at least 2 out of 3 assessments marked "more than half the time" on compliance questionnaire, MSD adherence feasibility measured by percent of participants with at least 2 out of 3 assessments marked "more than half the time" on compliance questionnaire.

This is a non-randomized cohort study. Participants will be on a specific diet for 4 weeks prior to transplant and 10 days after transplant, and will then be asked to fill out several questionnaires during this period to see if this diet is easy and simple to follow. The questionnaires will be weekly while participants are outpatient and once admitted to the hospital, participants will need to fill it on the last day (10 days after stem cell infusion). Participants will also be requested to provide fecal swab samples which we will test for bacteria and fungi. A total of 3 samples will be taken at different time points during this study.
