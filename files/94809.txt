The Role of Prophylactic Central Compartment Neck Dissection in the Management of 2 to 4 Cm Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma
This randomized prospective study aims to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages (both oncologic and surgical) of prophylactic central compartment neck dissection for clinically node-negative 2-4 cm papillary thyroid carcinoma patients who have been treated either with total thyroidectomy alone or with total thyroidectomy + prophylactic central compartment neck dissection .

PROCEDURE: Total Thyroidectomy + Central Compartment Neck Dissection
Number of Patients with Persistent or Recurrent Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma, Persistent or recurrent disease refers to the presence or reappearance of cancerous tissue despite initial treatment. It is assessed through a combination of biochemical and imaging studies. Biochemically, elevated serum thyroglobulin (Tg) or detectable anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb) after total thyroidectomy may suggest residual or recurrent disease. Moreover, they may represent a biochemical incomplete or indeterminate response to therapy. On the other hand, imaging techniques such as neck ultrasound or CT scan can identify structural disease., from enrollment to 1, 3, 5 and 10 years|Overall Survival, Overall survival is the most comprehensive indicator of treatment efficacy and patient prognosis. It is typically assessed through survival analysis methods, such as Kaplan-Meier curves, and is expressed as a percentage of patients alive at specific time points., from the enrollment to 1, 3, 5, and 10 years
Surgical Complications, Complications following thyroidectomy are mainly hypoparathyroidism, vocal cord palsy and bleeding. They are assessed through clinical evaluation, laboratory tests (e.g., calcium and PTH levels for hypoparathyroidism), and laryngoscopy and / or transcutaneous laryngeal ultrasound for vocal cord function., from enrollment to 1, 3, 5 and 10 years
