Evaluation of the Accuracy of Percutaneous Biopsy by Vacuum-assisted Biopsy (VAB) to Assess Pathological Complete Response in Patients With Clinical and Radiological Complete Response After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy (NeoVAB)
Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in females in the world. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is increasingly used in patients with operable breast cancer to enhance the likelihood of breast conservation. New generation of treatments or combinations lead to a high rate of pathological complete responses (pCR) in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive (HER2) and triple negative tumours. Safe omission of surgery in patients who receive NAC and achieve radiologic complete response depends on the ability to accurately estimate pCR preoperatively.

If pathological complete response after NAC could be accurately assessed by VAB, surgery could be avoided. In the context of new treatments or combinations with an increased pCR rate, this new strategy could induce major changes in clinical practice, leading to breast surgery de-escalation.
Vacuum-assisted Biopsy
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Vacuum-assisted biopsy
False negative rate of vacuum-assisted biopsy, Absence of invasive and in-situ carcinoma on vacuum-assisted biopsy but presence of invasive or in-situ carcinoma on the surgical specimen., During the surgery
A total of 66 patients will be submitted to percutaneous vacuum-assisted biopsy (VAB), followed by breast surgery. The primary endpoint of the study is the false negative rate of VAB procedure. This rate will be calculated by comparing the detection of invasive or in situ carcinoma on surgical specimen versus VAB samples. The secondary endpoints of the study are feasibility, VAB procedure technical complications and safety.
