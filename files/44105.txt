Disitamab Vedotin With Pembrolizumab vs Chemotherapy in Previously Untreated Urothelial Cancer Expressing HER2
This study will enroll participants with urothelial cancer (UC). UC can include cancer of the bladder, kidney, or the tubes that carry pee through the body (ureter, urethra). This study will try to find out if the drugs disitamab vedotin with pembrolizumab works better than platinum-containing chemotherapy to treat patients with UC. This study will also test what side effects happen when participants take these drugs together. A side effect is anything a drug does to the body besides treating the disease.

Participants in this study will have cancer that has spread through the body (metastatic) or spread near where it started (locally advanced).

In this study, there are 2 different groups. Participants will be assigned to a group randomly. Participants in the disitamab vedotin arm will get the study drug disitamab vedotin once every two weeks and pembrolizumab once every 6 weeks. Participants in the standard of care arm will get gemcitabine once a week for 2 weeks with either cisplatin or carboplatin once every 3 weeks.

Scores range from 0-100. For GHS/QoL and functional scales, higher scores represent higher QoL or functioning. For symptom scales, higher scores represent more symptoms/worse status., Approximately 2 years|Time to Deterioration in EORTC QLQ-C30 GHS/QoL Score, The time from the date of randomization to the date of first deterioration (change from baseline â‰¥10) in GHS/QoL score with no subsequent recovery. The EORTC QLQ-C30 is used to evaluate health-related quality of life, functioning, disease symptoms, and treatment-related side effects. Scores range from 0-100. For GHS/QoL and functional scales, higher scores represent higher QoL or functioning. For symptom scales, higher scores represent more symptoms/worse status., Approximately 2 years|Time to pain progression, The time from the date of randomization to whichever of the following occurs earlier:

* an increase in Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) for pain intensity of 2 points or more from baseline at 2 consecutive visits,
* an increase in number of opioid or analgesic use from baseline,
* or initiation of opioid or analgesic use. NRS for pain intensity asks participants to best describe their pain at its worst in the last 24 hours from 0 to 10. On the NRS, 0 means no pain and 10 means pain as bad as you can imagine., Approximately 2 years
