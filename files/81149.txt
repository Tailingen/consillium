Predictive Role of Microbiome in Patients With Urothelial Carcinoma
This study aims to establish the microbiota composition as a predictive tool for the response to the intravesical immunotherapy with Bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG) and 2 different chemotherapies schemes.

In this prospective cohort study patients with low/intermediate/high risk non muscle invasive bladder carcinoma (NMIBC) that undergo BCG/chemo treatment will be enrolled to collect urine stool and blood at different endpoints. Microbiota, short-chain fatty acids and immunophenotype will be quantified to develop a predictive screening platform, which might also integrate traditional urinary cytology and FISH data.
Urinary Bladder Cancer
OTHER: DNA extraction from urine, stool and biopsy. Isolation of serum and PBMC from peripheral blood.
Establish the change of microbial profile in high-grade NMIBC patients after BCG administration, Establish the change of urinary and fecal microbiome richness and diversity, and immunophenotype in bladder carcinoma patients after intravesical BCG treatment., 2 years
The predictive role of microbiome in BCG responsiveness, Categorize potential candidates for BCG therapy, based on the microbiota pre-therapy., 11 years
The purpose of this research is to understand the possible use of microbial profile from catheterized urine and feces of patients with NMIBC to categorize patients in two groups: those likely to respond positively and those unlikely to respond to the therapy. Goal of this study is to identify the predictive role of the microbiome to therapy response, thus allowing clinicians to deliver the most appropriate treatment based on the microbiome (microbiome-personalized therapy).
