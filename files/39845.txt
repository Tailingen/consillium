Endoscopic Full Thickness Resection With Laparoscopic Assistance
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of endoscopic full-thickness resection with laparoscopic assistance.
Gastric Subepithelial Tumor
PROCEDURE: EFTR with LA
En-bloc resection and successful closure, successful En-bloc resection of subepithelial tumor and successful closure of resection site by Endoscopic full-thickness resection with laparoscopic assistance., 3 months after surgery
number of troche, during surgery
The laparoscopic resection with a linear stapler for subepithelial tumors (SET) can lead to excessive resection of healthy tissue of the gastric wall resulting in deformity or stenosis. Attaining a positive surgical margin is also possible. Endoscopic full-thickness resection (EFTR) can be used for tumor resection by direct visualization of the tumor from inside the stomach lumen leading to a free surgical margin with little resection of healthy tissue. In order to overcome current endoscopic technical limitations, we will combine the conventional laparoscopic approach with EFTR.
