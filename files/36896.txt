An Exploratory Study of Tislelizumab in Combination with Chemotherapy in Immuno-experienced Patients with EGFR/ALK/ROS1-negative Advanced NSCLC in the Second-line Setting
The goal of this clinical trial is to explore the efficacy and safety of denosumab in combination with tislelizumab and chemotherapy in the second-line treatment of immuno-experienced patients with EGFR/ALK/ROS1-negative advanced NSCLC.

Primary endpoint:

progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by investigators according to RECIST 1.1;

Secondary endpoint:

1. Overall survival (OS) assessed by investigators according to RECIST 1.1;
2. Objective response rate (ORR) assessed by investigators according to RECIST 1.1;
3. Disease control rate (DCR) assessed by investigators according to RECIST 1.1;
4. Duration of response (DOR) assessed by investigators according to RECIST 1.1;

Exploratory endpoint:

bone metastasis-free survival.

Participants will receive denosumab combined with tislelizumab and docetaxel.

progress free survival, Progression-free survival refers to the time from the start of combined treatment to any objectively documented tumor progression or patient death (the last follow-up date for patients lost to follow-up; the end of follow-up date for patients still alive at the end of the study)., up to 24 months
overall survival, Overall survival (OS): the time from the first dose to death from any cause (the last follow-up date for patients who were lost to follow-up; the end of follow-up date for patients who were still alive at the end of the study), up to 24 months|objective response rate, Objective response rate (ORR) refers to the proportion of patients whose tumors shrink to a certain amount and remain so for a certain period of time, including cases of complete remission (CR) and partial remission (PR)., 12 months|Disease control rate, Disease control rate (DCR): refers to the proportion of patients whose tumors shrink to a certain amount and remain so for a certain period of time, including cases of complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR) and stable disease (SD)., 12 months|Duration of remission, Duration of response (DOR): refers to the duration from the first recorded confirmed response (CR or PR) to the first recorded disease progression (PD) or death due to any cause (whichever occurs first)., 12 months
