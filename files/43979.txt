Ultra-high Dose Radiation for Liver Metastasis Using MR-guided TReatment With Stereotactic Ablative Single-fraction
This international multi-centre phase 3 randomized control trial investigates whether giving a very high dose of radiation in a single treatment session (ultra-high dose: experimental) using advanced technology called MR-Linac is more effective than a high dose (control) for treating liver tumors that have spread from other parts of the body (liver metastases). This study also aims to identify predictors of treatment response and side effects by analyzing various factors such as imaging markers and genetic profiles.

Liver metastases are common in several cancers, but surgery is often not feasible for many patients. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), which delivers focused radiation to tumors, is an alternative treatment option. Previous studies have shown promising results with SBRT, but the optimal radiation dose for liver metastases is still uncertain.

This study will look at patients with specific types of primary cancers known to respond well to SBRT. Treatment effectiveness will be assessed by monitoring tumor control, overall survival, and quality of life.

By comparing ultra-high dose SBRT with standard high dose, the study aims to determine if the former can provide better tumor control with fewer side effects. If successful, this approach could offer a significant advancement in the treatment of liver metastases, potentially improving outcomes and quality of life for patients.
