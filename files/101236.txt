Efficacy and Safety of Panobinostat (LBH589) in Patients With Refractory de Novo or Secondary Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML)
This study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of single agent oral panobinostat in patients who have refractory de novo or refractory secondary AML.
Refractory Leukemia|Acute Myelogenous Leukemia
DRUG: Panobinostat/LBH589
Best Response as Per Investigator Assessment by Stratum (FAS), Response to treatment was defined as complete remission rate (CRR). CRR is complete remission (CR) and morphologic CR with incomplete blood count recovery (residual neutropenia or thrombocytopenia) (CRi). To stop or to proceed with Stage 2 of a given stratum of the Simon's optimal 2-stage design was based on the number of patients with CR/CRi and a safety evaluation of the patients from Stage 1 in that stratum. If early results clearly indicated that the drug was not active or worthy of further investigation, enrollment of that particular stratum would be terminated. CR and CRi were assessed by the Investigator according to IWG response Criteria for AML (Cheson et al 2003). As per protocol we would continue to stage II if â‰¥ 4 patients out of 26 patients enrolled to stage I had a CR or a CRi. As per response observed there was only 1 patient with CR/CRi in stratum A and 2 patients with CR/CRi in Stratum B., 6 cycles of treatment with a 28-day treatment cycle (Day 168)
Partial Response Measured in Stratum A and B, As predefined in the study's protocol, stage II was not pursued due to lack of activity (at end of stage I less than 4 patients in each stratum with CR/CRi), 6 treatment cycles (28-day/treatment cycle)|Time to Remission Measured in Stratum A and B, 6 treatment cycles (28-day/treatment cycle)|Duration of Remission Measured in Stratum A and B, 6 treatment cycles (28-day/treatment cycle)|Event-free Survival Measured in Stratum A and B, 6 treatment cycles (28-day/treatment cycle)|Overall Survival Measured in Stratum A and B, 6 treatment cycles (28-day/treatment cycle)
