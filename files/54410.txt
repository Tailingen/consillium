INCB000928 Administered as a Monotherapy or in Combination With Ruxolitinib in Participants With Anemia Due to Myeloproliferative Disorders
This Phase 1/2, open-label, dose-finding study is intended to evaluate the safety and tolerability, PK, PD, and efficacy of INCB000928 administered as monotherapy or in combination with ruxolitinib in participants with MF who are transfusion-dependent or presenting with symptomatic anemia. This study will consist of 2 parts: dose escalation and expansion.
