Fitness, Activity and Lung Cancer Study
The purpose of the study is to investigate the change in pulmonary function and exercise capacity in lung cancer patients after pulmonary resection. Furthermore, to study the effect of training on aerobic capacity, muscular strength, morbidity and survival. Physical activity level by accelerometers, body composition by DXA and quality of life will also be reported.
Lung Cancer
OTHER: Physical training|OTHER: As usual
Change in Maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) from baseline, Change in VO2max from before to after surgery to measure the effect of surgery, and after six months to measure the effect of high-intensity training intervention, and after five years to study long-term effects, An expected average of two weeks before surgery (baseline), four to six weeks after surgery, after six months and after 5 years
Change in Pulmonary function from baseline, Change in pulmonary function from before to after surgery and after the intervention, Pulmonary function is measured three times; an expected average of two weeks before surgery, four to six weeks after surgery, after after six months and after five years.
DXA scan, Change in body composition from before to after surgery and after the intervention, An expected average of two weeks before surgery, four to six weeks after surgery, after six months and after five years|Quality of life, Change in quality of life from before to after surgery and after the intervention, Measured three times: An expected average of two weeks before surgery, four to six weeks after surgery, after six months and after five years|Physical activity, Physical activity will be objectively measured by accelerometers for seven consecutive days to determine change in activity level after surgery, Measured three times: six weeks after surgery, after six months and after five years
Five year after surgery, all included patients will be reinvited to undergo a fourth health excame to study the long-term effects of exercise training on physical fitness, morbidity and survival.
