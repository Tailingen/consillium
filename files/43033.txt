Review of Molecular Profiling-Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (Rt-Pcr) in Unknown Primary Cancer
This will be a retrospective review of 30 patients with unknown primary cancer who have had commercially available RT-PCR assays performed on biopsied tumors, in order to determine if the assay results are consistent with clinical features and useful for planning initial therapy or changing therapy.
Unknown Primary Cancer
To correlate the tissue of origin predicted by the RT-PCR assay with clinical and pathologic features of patients with carcinoma of unknown primary site., 6 months
To correlate the tissue of origin predicted by the RT-PCR with actual primary sites found subsequently in a subset of patients., 6 months|To evaluate the utility of RT-PCR assay results in guiding treatment selection in patients with carcinoma of unknown primary site., 6 months
