Comparison of Technics for Determination of Epstein-Barr Virus Serological Diagnosis
This study compared the performance of three automated immunoassays, Architect (Abbott), Immulite (Siemens) and Liaison (Diasorin), for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) serology. Ninety-one serum samples collected in Amiens University Hospital were analyzed for the presence of Viral Capsid Antigen (VCA) IgG and IgM and Epstein-Barr Nuclear Antigen (EBNA) IgG. The agreement between the three assays was calculated for each marker individually and for determination of the EBV profile, based on interpretation of the combination of these three EBV markers.

Capacity of the three assays to detect VCA IgM, The aim of the present study is to evlaute the capacity of the three tests to detect VCA IgM. 91 samples was collected and tested for EBV VCA IgG, EBV VCA IgM and EBV EBNA IgG in order to determine infection status (primary EBV infection, past infection, absence of infection and indeterminate status)., 2years
This retrospective study was conducted on 91 samples collected between 2014 and 2015 for which EBV diagnosis was requested. The serological diagnosis of EBV infection was performed in the Amiens University Hospital virology laboratory (France). The median age of patients was 34 years (mean: 38 years, range: 3-82 year) with a sex ratio of 50%. Sixteen of the 91 samples concerned children (\<15 years).
