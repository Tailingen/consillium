Consolidative Radiotherapy for Metastatic Urothelial Bladder Cancer Patients Without Progression and With no More Than Three Residual Metastatic Lesions Following First Line Systemic Therapy
This is a Phase II, multicenter, randomized open-label and comparative study that has been designed to evaluate whether local consolidative radiotherapy in addition to standard of care improves overall survival as compared with standard of care in patients with regional and/or distant metastatic urothelial bladder cancer who have no disease progression and with no more than three residual distant metastatic lesions following the initial phase of first-line systemic therapy.

Each patient will be followed during 4 years from the date of randomization.

Overall Survival, 4 years for each patient
Progression Free Survival, 4 years for each patient|Safety will be assessed by the toxicity grading of the National Cancer Institute (NCI-CTCAE v5), 4 years for each patient|Quality of life will be evaluated by the EORTC QLQ-C-30 questionnaire, 4 years for each patient
