Dynamic Multiomics Evaluation of Anti-HER2 and Immunotherapy in HER2 Positive Gastric Cancer
Dynamic multiomics explore the efficacy and mechanism of anti-HER2 \& immunotherapy of HER2 Positive GC
HER2 Positive Advanced Gastric Cancer
PROCEDURE: Samples including blood and tissue collection|PROCEDURE: CTC detection|PROCEDURE: ctDNA detection|PROCEDURE: 10×genomics single cell RNA sequence|PROCEDURE: Whole exon sequence|PROCEDURE: Proteomics detection
Proportions of HER2 & PD-L1 positive CTC, Numbers of CTC and proportions of HER2 or PD-L1 positive CTC collected at treatment baseline and every time point response will be calculated and recorded. Proportions of HER2 and PD-L1 positive CTC will be compared between two groups., 2 months|Incidence rate of ctDNA deletion, amplification, insertion and other types of variation evaluated by next generation sequence(NGS)., NGS will be proceeded to detect the ctDNA variations features at treatment baseline and every time point response will be recorded and compared between two groups., 2 months|Proportions of lymphocytes, stromal cells, tumor cells in tumor tissue assessed by single cell transcriptome sequence., single cell digested from tumor tissue will be administrated to 10× genomics single cell transcriptome sequence. Proportions of lymphocytes, stromal cells, tumor cells assessed by single cell transcriptome sequence at treatment baseline, the second time point response and disease progression time point will be recorded and compared between two groups., Treatment baseline; Up to 2 months from the initial treatment; From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months|Incidence rate of gene deletion, amplification, insertion and other types of variation of tumor evaluated by whole exon sequence(WES)., DNA extracted from tumor tissue will be administrated to whole exon sequence.Variation features at treatment baseline, the second time point response and disease progression time point will be recorded and compared between two groups., Treatment baseline; Up to 2 months from the initial treatment; From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months|Tumor associated proteins expression level of tumor, 96 tumor associated proteins' expression level of tumor at treatment baseline, second time point response and disease progression time point will be recorded and compared between two groups., Treatment baseline; Up to 2 months from the initial treatment; From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months
The investigators will recruit 100 HER2 positive advanced gastric cancer patients.Blood and tumor tissue will be collected at treatment baseline, every time point response till disease progression. All samples will be processed by next-generation sequence , 10× genomics single-cell sequence ,whole exon sequence, proteome detection and CTC detection to explore the efficacy and mechanism of anti-HER2 \& immunotherapy of HER2 positive GC.
