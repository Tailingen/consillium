EPISPOT Detection of Circulating Prostate Cells Among Adenocarcinoma Patients
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the predictive value (in terms of remission) of a new technique for detecting circulating, functional, prostate cells among patients with localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate, and prior to any treatment.
