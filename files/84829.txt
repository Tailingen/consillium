Bisphenol and Phthalate Exposures in Triple Negative Breast Cancer
In this observational pilot study urine samples will be collected from women receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin for triple negative breast cancer to determine whether: 1) exposures bisphenol and phthalate levels change over the course of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and 2) levels differ between black women and those of other racial groups.

The hypothesis is that bisphenol and phthalate levels will be similar to those of the general US female population at the time of diagnosis, however levels will increase during treatment due to exposure to plastics in the medical setting. The investigators also hypothesize that because of differences in personal care product use, black women may have higher urinary levels of bisphenols and phthalates prior to starting chemotherapy.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive breast cancer subtype that does not express estrogen, progesterone, or the human epidermal growth factor (HER2/neu) receptors, and has a low overall survival rate compared to other types of breast cancer.

Unlike hormone and HER2/neu positive breast cancers, targeted therapies are not available for TNBC. Thus, the systemic chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin is widely used for the treatment of TNBC. However, doxorubicin resistance is common, and leads to poorer treatment outcomes.

Understanding factors that contribute to doxorubicin resistance is critical to improving cancer treatment outcomes among women with TNBC. Pre-clinical in vitro studies indicate that exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals, such as bisphenols and phthalates, contribute to doxorubicin resistance, but these findings have not been evaluated in humans.
