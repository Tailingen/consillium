This study aimed to comparatively investigate the effects of ESWT and LLLT added to conventional CDT (which is the standard treatment for breast cancer-related lymphedema) on patients' limb volume, pain intensity, functional status and quality of life.
Lymphedema, Breast Cancer
OTHER: Complete Decongestive Therapy|DEVICE: ESWT|DEVICE: LLLT
Extremity volumes, Upper limb Volume measured by perometer, Baseline, after three weeks
Lymphedema Quality of Life-arm (LYMQOL-arm ), quality of life questionnaire that is spesific for upper limb lymphedema, Baseline, after three weeks|Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) Questionnaire, questionnaire that shows functional status, Baseline, after three weeks|Visual Anologue Scale -Pain (VAS), a straight line with one end meaning no pain and the other end meaning the worst pain imaginable, Baseline, after three weeks
after being informed study and potential risks, all patient giving written informed consent will undergo screening period determine eligibility for study entry. The patients who meet the eligibility recruitments will get treatment into three groups in conventional complet decongestive therapy (CDT) program, electrocorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) combined with CDT program and low level laser therapy (LLLT) combined with CDT program
