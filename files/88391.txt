A Proof of Concept Trial Investigating Safety and Efficacy of APG-157 in Oral Dysplasia
The purpose of this study is to assess whether APG-157 can reduce the tumor size in participants with the study disease. Another purpose is to find out about the effects of APG-157 on certain tumor markers and oral rinses in participants with the study disease.
Oropharyngeal Dysplasia|Oral Cavity Dysplasia|Oral Carcinoma in Situ
DRUG: APG-157
Pathologic Response Rate, The pathologic response rate among participants receiving study treatment will be assessed. The pathologic response rate is defined as the percentage of participants with mild or no dysplasia after receiving study therapy. Response will be assessed on the basis of clinical, radiologic, molecular and pathologic criteria consistent with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v.1.1 criteria, per physician discretion., Up to 12 weeks
Clinical Response Rate, The clinical response rate among participants receiving study treatment will be assessed. The clinical response rate is defined as the percentage of participants with complete response (CR) and/or partial response (PR) after receiving study therapy. Response will be assessed on the basis of clinical, radiologic, molecular and pathologic criteria consistent with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v.1.1 criteria., Up to 12 weeks|Change in Lesion Appearance Before and After Protocol Therapy, Change in lesion appearance will be assessed using criteria consistent with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v.1.1 criteria, found at time of oral exam per physician discretion., Baseline, 12 weeks post-intervention, Up to 28 months|Number of Treatment-Related Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events, The number of treatment-related adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) in participants receiving protocol therapy will be assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) Version 5, per physician discretion., Up to 16 weeks
