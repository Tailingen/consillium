CAREMM-2306: Advanced Immunotherapy vs. Classical Immunotherapy
The goal of this retrospective study is to compare between the case cohort and control cohort.

The case cohort consists of lymphoma patients treated with novel immunotherapy regimen including Chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy, bispecfic antibody, and/or antibody-drug conjugate.

The control cohort consists of lymphoma patients who received conventional chemotherapy as standard-of-care

The main question\[s\] it aims to answer are:

* Survival times
* Response outcomes
Lymphoma
DRUG: Immunotherapy
Comparison of Survival Periods Among Groups Comparison of Survival Periods Among Groups, overall survival, Time Frame: Up to 2 years
Comparison of Progression-Free Survival Periods, progression-free survival, Time Frame: Up to 2 years
Comparison of Response Rates, response rate, Time Frame: Up to 2 years|Comparison of Healthcare Costs, costs, Time Frame: Up to 2 years
1. Primary endpoints Comparison of survival time by treatment between two groups
2. Secondary endpoints 2.1 Comparison of progression-free survival between two groups 2.2 Comparison of response rates between two groups 2.3 Comparison of input medical costs between two groups.

2. Study subjects: Patients treated for lymphoma at Yeouido St. Mary's Hospital and Seoul St. Mary's Hospital (Both are located on Seoul, Korea) between May 2009 and June 2023.

3. Selection criteria: 3.1 Patients diagnosed with malignant lymphoma at Catholic Yeouido St. Mary's Hospital and Seoul St. Mary's Hospital between May 2009 and June 2023.

3.2 Age 19 or older. 3.3 Patients who treated with salvage chemotherapy for the relapsed/refractory lymphoma.

4. Exclusion criteria: 4.1 Patients suffering from acute leukemia. 4.2 Patients additionally diagnosed with solid cancer (colon cancer, lung cancer, stomach cancer, etc.) during treatment.
