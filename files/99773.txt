PAPRIKA - Patients Empowerment for Major Surgery Preparation @Home
PAPRIKA establishes a technologically enabled and personalized prehabilitation and follow-up after surgical intervention program for patients undergoing elective major surgery Program creates close collaboration between the medical environment and the patients empowering them to co-create their own care.

It is at the first stage aimed to high-risk patients undergoing major surgery. Better condition before the surgery is proved to reduce the perioperative complications and to improve patients' health-related quality of life while cutting the associated costs. The concept integrates short-term (average 4 weeks) preoperative interventions including endurance training, promotion of physical activity and nutritional and psychological support. Interventions are planned both at community and at hospital reducing unnecessary interactions between patients and tertiary care.

PAPRIKA tackles three major drivers: i) human perspective ii) organizational challenges and iii) technical aspects. The project is based on previous experience on prehabilitation and the already refined service using design thinking methodologies. It will be also based on the proven reduction of associated costs for the healthcare system.
