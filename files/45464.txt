Educational Follow-up in a Cohort of Children at the Royal Marsden Hospital (RMH)
To document pre-diagnosis educational abilities, to document any change in educational achievements following treatment, to document educational support given within the statement process and to document the timing of support.
Brain Tumour
To compare educational achievements of children of different tumour types following treatment.|To document if there are any differences in educational achievements depending on the age at diagnosis of the brain tumour.
This will be a retrospective study. Cases will be identified by looking at the Royal Marsden Hospital (RMH) coding database. All the patients will have completed treatment for a brain tumour. The children all need to have started school before the diagnosis of their brain tumour so that we can look at easily defined educational assessments in this cohort. Children will be identified by looking at RMH coding of diagnosis and include children aged between 4 years and 18 years old (school age).
