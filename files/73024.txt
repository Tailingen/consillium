Natural Killer (NK) Cell Therapy Targeting CD33 in Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This is an open-label, Phase I study of QN-023a (allogeneic CAR-NK cells targeting CD33) in relapsed/refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML).

The clinical study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of QN-023a in patients with relapsed/refractory AML,where a "3+3" enrollment schema will be utilized at dose escalation stage. Up to 19 patients will be enrolled.
