Safety and Efficacy of CG0070 Oncolytic Virus Regimen for High Grade NMIBC After BCG Failure
To study the safety and efficacy of CG0070, an oncolytic virus expression GM-CSF in high grade non muscle invasive bladder cancer patients who failed BCG therapy and refused cystectomy.
Bladder Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: CG0070
Durable Complete Response Proportion (DCR), Defined as the proportion of patients who experience a durable complete response lasting 12 months or longer from the initial confirmed complete response date (first CR assessment to be at least 6 months after the first intravesical intervention) and at least 18 months from the date of the first intravesical intervention, 18 months time point from the date of the first intravesical intervention
Cystectomy Free Survival, Not available, not collected on study or not currently available, 18 months after the first intravesical treatment|Complete Response Survival, Not available, not collected on study or not currently available, 18 months after the first intravesical treatment|Progression Free Survival, Not available, not collected on study or not currently available, 18 months after the first intravesical treatment|Time to Progression to Muscle Invasive Disease, Not available, not collected on study or not currently available, 18 months after the first intravesical treatment|Overall Survival, Not available, not collected on study or not currently available, 18 months and 24 months after first intravesical treatment|PD-L1 Status Changes, PD-L1 status of cancer cells and immune cells at tumor site by IHC, changes between pre-intervention and post intervention at either cystectomy or at biopsy up to 24 months|Organ Confined Disease Proportions, Patient proportions with no cancer cells in regional lymph nodes at cystectomy, at cystectomy|Complete Response Proportions, Proportions of patients with a complete response of at least 12 months' duration, 24 months after the first intravesical treatment|PD-1 Status Changes, PD-1 status of immune cells at tumor site by IHC, changes between pre-intervention and post intervention at either cystectomy or at biopsy up to 24 months|Disease Regression Proportions, Proportions of patients with a partial response and/or a complete response of less than 12 months' duration, 24 months after the first intravesical treatment
The plan is to study the safety and efficacy of CG0070 in high-grade NMIBC (Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer) patients who failed BCG therapy. Most patients with NMIBCis (Cis, Cis with Ta and/or T1, high grade Ta or T1 with frequent or uncontrolled recurrences) who have failed BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guerin) intravesical therapy (standard of care) usually have no other choice but to proceed to cystectomy. Cystectomy is a surgery associated with major morbidity, mortality and quality of life issues. Morbidity and long term tedious medical care will be for the rest of the patient's life span. Most patients at this stage do not show signs of disease progression into the muscle layer or of metastasis, making surgery a very difficult decision. CG0070, if successful in this trial, will serve to provide a therapeutic alternative for this patient population in need.
