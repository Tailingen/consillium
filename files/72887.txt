Anti-Angiogenic Therapy Post Transplant (ASCR) for Pediatric Solid Tumors
The purpose of this research study is to determine whether taking either of two low dose drugs that would prevent new blood vessels from growing after stem cell transplant is feasible, and what the side effects of taking each of these drugs after autologous transplant might be. The reason the investigators are looking at these drugs is because one of the things that allows tumors to grow quickly is their ability to stimulate the growth of new blood vessels. By suppressing the growth of new blood vessels after stem cell transplant, the investigators hope to prevent the tumors from coming back or continuing to grow.
