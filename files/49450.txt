Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma
DRUG: Albumin-bound paclitaxel|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin
Percentage of Participants Who Achieved an Objective Confirmed Complete Response or Partial Response by Blinded Radiology Assessment, Antitumor response was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved an objective response (Confirmed Response \[CR\] or Partial Response \[PR\]), confirmed by repeat assessments performed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response were first met. Response was based on the blinded radiological review using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) response guidelines, Version 1.0.

A complete response was defined as a disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions.

Partial response was defined as ≥ 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters (SLD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline SLD, and the persistence of one or more non-target lesions not qualifying for CR or Progressive Disease (the "unequivocal progression" of existing non-target lesion(s) or appearance of one or more new lesions)., Objective response was evaluated every 6 weeks until progression or new anti-cancer therapy initiation, up to 22 months.
Progression-free Survival by Blinded Radiology Assessment, Progression free survival time was defined as the time from the day of randomization to the start of disease progression or death (any cause), whichever occurred first, based on the blinded radiological review response assessment. Progressive disease was defined as a ≥ 20% increase in the SLD of target lesions, taking as reference the nadir SLD recorded since the treatment started, or the presence of one or more new lesions, or the "unequivocal progression" of existing non-target lesion(s) or appearance of one or more new lesion(s).

Participants who did not have disease progression or had not died were censored at the last visit they were documented as progression free. If palliative radiotherapy or surgery at lesion sites occurred, the participant was censored at the last date without documented progression prior to radiotherapy or surgery. In follow-up, participants who began new therapy prior to progression were censored at the last documented date as progression-free., Assessed every 6 weeks until progression or death, up to 38 months|Overall Participant Survival, Overall survival was defined as the time from the day of randomization to participant death (due to any cause), as assessed by post study follow-up performed monthly for 6 months and every 3 months thereafter for 12 months. All participants who were lost to the follow-up prior to the end of the trial or who completed the 18 month follow up phase were censored at last known time the participant was alive., Up to 38 months|Percentage of Participants With Controlled Disease, Controlled disease was defined as the percentage of participants with stable disease for ≥ 16 weeks or confirmed complete or partial overall response, based on blinded radiological assessment. Stable disease was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage of target lesions to qualify for Partial Response, nor sufficient increase to qualify for Progressive Disease, or the persistence of one or more non-target lesions not qualifying for Complete Response or Progressive Disease., Assessed every 6 weeks, up to 22 months|Duration of Response in Responding Patients, Duration of response was assessed by progression free survival for participants who achieved a confirmed complete response or partial response based on blinded radiological assessment., Assessed every 6 weeks, up to 38 months|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), A Treatment-emergent AE was any AE that began or worsened in grade after the start of study drug through 30 days after the last dose of study drug or end of study whichever is later. Treatment related toxicity was one considered by the investigator to be possibly, probably or definitely related to study drug. AEs were graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v3.0 on the following scale: Grade 1 = mild, Grade 2 = moderate, Grade 3 = severe, Grade 4 = life-threatening, Grade 5 = death. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that: is fatal or life-threatening; results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity; requires or prolongs in-patient hospitalization; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a patient; and conditions not included in the above that may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above., Up to 38 months|Pharmacokinetic (PK) Parameters, Blood samples for PK analyses were taken during Cycle 1 at 0.25, 3.5 and 24 hours post-infusion.|SPARC Status and Correlation With Overall Survival, The expression and cellular distribution of Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in cysteine (SPARC) in biopsies of lung tumor was examined by immunohistochemistry using a 2 antibody system by an approved central laboratory and analyzed by 2 pathologists. The following tissue components were scored: tumor cells, fibroblasts, inflammatory cells, acellular stroma/matrix, and blood vessels.

To classify participants into "high-SPARC" and "low-SPARC" groups, an average z-score was calculated across variables and classified "high-SPARC" (average z-scores ≥0) and "low-SPARC" (average z-scores \<0) groups.

SPARC status was then correlated with overall survival (the time from the day of randomization to participant death due to any cause)., Archival tissue samples were used for SPARC analysis. Survival was assessed for up to 38 months.
Percentage of Participants Who Achieved an Objective Confirmed Complete Response or Partial Response by Blinded Radiology Assessment, by Histology, Antitumor response was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved an objective response (Confirmed Response \[CR\] or Partial Response \[PR\]), confirmed by repeat assessments performed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response were first met. Response was based on the blinded radiological review using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) response guidelines, Version 1.0.

A complete response was defined as a disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions.

Partial response was defined as ≥ 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters (SLD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline SLD, and the persistence of one or more non-target lesions not qualifying for CR or Progressive Disease (the "unequivocal progression" of existing non-target lesion(s) or appearance of one or more new lesions).

Histology was determined at the time of primary diagnosis., Objective response was evaluated every 6 weeks until progression or new anti-cancer therapy initiation, up to 22 months.|Maximal Degree of Anemia Based on Clinical Laboratory Values for Hemoglobin, The maximal degree of anemia (and myelosuppression) was assessed by the overall nadir of hemoglobin levels based on clinical laboratory measurements graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 3.0., 38 months|Maximal Degree of Neutropenia Based on Clinical Laboratory Values of Absolute Neutrophil Count, The maximal degree of neutropenia (and myelosuppression) was assessed by the overall nadir of absolute neutrophil count (ANC) based on clinical laboratory measurements graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 3.0., 38 months|Maximal Degree of Thrombocytopenia Based on Clinical Laboratory Values of Platelet Count, The maximal degree of thrombocytopenia (and myelosuppression) was assessed by the overall nadir of platelet count based on clinical laboratory measurements graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 3.0., 38 months|Time to Improvement of ≥ Grade 3 Treatment Related Peripheral Neuropathy, Peripheral neuropathy was graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0 on the following scale: Grade 1 = mild, Grade 2 = moderate, Grade 3 = severe, Grade 4 = life-threatening, Grade 5 = death.

Improvement in peripheral neuropathy was evaluated as:

* Time to improvement of grade 3 or higher peripheral neuropathy by at least one grade;
* Time to improvement of grade 3 or higher peripheral neuropathy to grade 1.

Time to improvement was defined as the time from the first occurrence of grade 3 or higher treatment related neuropathy to improvement, as defined. Participants not experiencing improvement were censored at the last time the participant was evaluated for adverse events., 38 months
