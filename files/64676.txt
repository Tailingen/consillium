Safety of GX-188E DNA Therapeutic Vaccine Administered by Electroporation to Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia Grade 3
This study is to determine maximum tolerable dose (MTD) of GX 188E by defining the safety profile the safety and maximum tolerated dose of GX-188E administered by electroporation in Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia grade 3 (CIN 3) patients.
Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia 3
GENETIC: GX-188E administered by electroporation
Determination of maximum MTD by defining the safety profile of GX-188E, It would be determined based on the rate and severity grade of events or abnormalities through evaluating systemic or local adverse events, clinical laboratory test results, vital signs and so on., From baseline to end of study
The expression levels of GX-188E in blood, At week -2, week 2, week 12 ,week 20 and week 36|Immunologic reactogenicity by measuring HPV E6 and E7 specific T cell response (IFN-Î³ ELISPOT), At week -2, week 2, week 12 ,week 20 and week 36|The changes of the involved lesions and HPV infection status, Baseline, week 12 ,week 20 and week 36
This study is an open-label, dose-escalation, single-center, phase I study to evaluate the safety of GX-188E, a DNA-based therapeutic vaccine, administered by electroporation (EP) in patients with HPV-16 or HPV-18 associated cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN 3).

Each subject eligible to participate in the trial is given a subject number, which is assigned sequentially in ascending order, then allocated to only a single dose level of the drug. Three subjects are allocated at each dose level starting with 1mg whereby the dose is escalated in sequential subjects in ascending numerical order of subject ID.

Each subject visit the site three times for administration during the study and is given an intramuscular injection of GX-188E at a dose of 1mg, 2mg or 4mg by electroporation at each visit

The subjects conduct the follow-up visits twice, which are 8 weeks and 24 weeks after the third injection of GX-188E respectively.
