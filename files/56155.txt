Calcitriol in Preventing Lung Cancer in Smokers and Former Smokers at High Risk of Lung Cancer
RATIONALE: Calcitriol may prevent lung cancer in patients with metaplasia or dysplasia of the lungs.

PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the side effects and best dose of calcitriol in preventing lung cancer in current smokers and former smokers at high risk of lung cancer.
Lung Cancer|Precancerous Condition|Tobacco Use Disorder
DRUG: calcitriol|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis|OTHER: pharmacological study
Grade III-IV Toxicities or Any Grade II Toxicities Lasting More Than 2 Weeks, Number of participants with Adverse Events, Grade II lasting more than two weeks or Grade III or higher, graded according to CTEP Version 4 of the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) will be utilized for AE reporting.

CTEP Version 4 of the CTCAE is identified and located at:

http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm., 3 months
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To establish the safety of calcitriol in patients at high risk of lung cancer.
* To determine the dose-limiting toxicities of calcitriol in these patients.

OUTLINE: Patients receive oral calcitriol on day 1. Courses repeat every 2 weeks for 3 months in absence of unacceptable toxicity.

Patients undergo blood collection periodically for pharmacokinetic and molecular analysis.

After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.
