A Safety and Tolerability Study of Clofarabine, Etoposide, Cyclophosphamide, PEG-asparaginase, and Vincristine in Pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)
This is an open-label study of Clofarabine, Etoposide, Cyclophosphamide, PEG-asparaginase, and Vincristine to assess this 5-drug treatment's safety and tolerability in pediatric patients with first relapse Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL).
Lymphoblastic Leukemia, Acute, Childhood
DRUG: Clofarabine incorporated into a 5-drug regimen
The incidence of DLTs (Dose Limiting Toxicities) experienced with 1 cycle of this 5-drug regimen in this patient population (in all patients who receive any doses of study drugs), 1 cycle
Overall toxicity profile documented by incidence of AEs, SAEs, and/or DLTs, 1 cycle|Efficacy as documented by complete remission (CR), time and duration of remission, event-free survival (EFS), 4-month EFS, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival, 2 cycles
The trial is a Phase 1, open-label study to assess the safety and tolerability of incorporating clofarabine into an intensive chemotherapy regimen of etoposide, cyclophosphamide, PEG-asparaginase, and vincristine. Patients enrolled in this study will receive a maximum of 2 cycles of the 5-drug regimen, then will be treated according to investigator discretion. After the study treatment period, all patients will be followed for a minimum of 4 months beyond the final study visit. This study will include a maximum of 12 evaluable patients.
