Gastrointestinal Microflora and Serum Metabolomics in Patients With Pancreatic Cancer and Chronic Pancreatitis
The investigators plan to collect throat swabs, saliva, feces and serum samples from pancreatic cancer patients, chronic pancreatitis patients and healthy people and clarify the characteristics of oral flora and serum metabolome of pancreatic cancer patients.
Pancreatic Cancer|Chronic Pancreatitis
serum metabolites, Perform Untargeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to analyse serum samples collected from pancreatic cancer patients, chronic pancreatitis patients and healthy people., Baseline|Gastrointestinal microbiota, Perform 16S RNA sequence and shotgun metagenomic analysis of fecal, throat swabs and salivary samples collected from pancreatic cancer patients, chronic pancreatitis patients and healthy people., Baseline|Overall Survival, The length of time (in days) from study enrollment that participants remain alive., up to 2 years|Predictive model, Combined with preoperative imaging and pathological information, a predictive model of pancreatic cancer would be established based on the metabolic and microbiota difference. Verify the stability and accuracy of our model in larger cohorts and promote clinical translation., up to 2 years
