Time to First On-study Skeletal Related Event, A skeletal-related event (SRE) is defined as one of the following: pathologic fracture (vertebral or non-vertebral), radiation therapy to bone (including the use of radioisotopes), surgery to bone, or spinal cord compression. Time to first on-study SRE is defined as the time interval (in days) from the randomization date to the date of first occurrence of on-study SRE. If there was no known event, and the participant was monitored for any one of the four SRE components, time to first on-study SRE was censored at the end of the treatment phase date or the primary analysis data cut-off date, whichever came first., From randomization until the primary analysis data cut-off date of 19 July 2016 (per protocol); median time on study was 17.6 and 17.3 months in each treatment group respectively.|Percentage of Participants With an On-study Skeletal Related Event, A skeletal-related event (SRE) is defined as one of the following: pathologic fracture (vertebral or non-vertebral), radiation therapy to bone (including the use of radioisotopes), surgery to bone, or spinal cord compression., From randomization until the primary analysis data cut-off date of 19 July 2016 (per protocol); median time on study was 17.6 and 17.3 months in each treatment group respectively.|Kaplan-Meier Estimate of Percentage of Participants With an On-study Skeletal Related Event, A skeletal-related event (SRE) is defined as one of the following: pathologic fracture (vertebral or non-vertebral), radiation therapy to bone (including the use of radioisotopes), surgery to bone, or spinal cord compression., From randomization until the primary analysis data cut-off date of 19 July 2016 (per protocol); median time on study was 17.6 and 17.3 months in each treatment group respectively. The Kaplan-Meier estimate at weeks 25, 49 and 109 is reported.
Time to First On-study Skeletal Related Event - Superiority Analysis, A skeletal-related event (SRE) is defined as one of the following: pathologic fracture (vertebral or non-vertebral), radiation therapy to bone (including the use of radioisotopes), surgery to bone, or spinal cord compression. Time to first on-study SRE is defined as the time interval (in days) from the randomization date to the date of first occurrence of on-study SRE. If there was no known event, and the participant was monitored for any one of the four SRE components, time to first on-study SRE was censored at the end of the treatment phase date or the primary analysis data cut-off date, whichever came first., From randomization until the primary analysis data cut-off date of 19 July 2016 (per protocol); median time on study was 17.6 and 17.3 months in each treatment group respectively.|Time to First and Subsequent On-Study Skeletal Related Event - Number of Events Per Patient, A skeletal-related event (SRE) is defined as one of the following: pathologic fracture (vertebral or non-vertebral), radiation therapy to bone (including the use of radioisotopes), surgery to bone, or spinal cord compression. Time to first on-study SRE is defined as the time interval (in days) from the randomization date to the date of first occurrence of on-study SRE. Time to a subsequent SRE is defined, similarly to the time to first on-study SRE, as the time interval from the randomization date to the date of a subsequent occurrence of on-study SRE, which had to be at least 21 days after the previous SRE.

A multiple event analysis was used, which accounts for both the absolute number of SREs and for the time between two consecutive events, and therefore, provides a more sensitive assessment of the risk of experiencing an SRE. The average number of events per patient is reported., From randomization until the primary analysis data cut-off date of 19 July 2016 (per protocol); median time on study was 17.6 and 17.3 months in each treatment group respectively.|Time to First and Subsequent On-Study Skeletal Related Event - Number of Events, A skeletal-related event (SRE) is defined as one of the following: pathologic fracture (vertebral or non-vertebral), radiation therapy to bone (including the use of radioisotopes), surgery to bone, or spinal cord compression. Time to first on-study SRE is defined as the time interval (in days) from the randomization date to the date of first occurrence of on-study SRE. Time to a subsequent SRE is defined, similarly to the time to first on-study SRE, as the time interval from the randomization date to the date of a subsequent occurrence of on-study SRE, which had to be at least 21 days after the previous SRE.

A multiple event analysis was used, which accounts for both the absolute number of SREs and for the time between two consecutive events, and therefore, provides a more sensitive assessment of the risk of experiencing an SRE. The total number of events is reported., From randomization until the primary analysis data cut-off date of 19 July 2016 (per protocol); median time on study was 17.6 and 17.3 months in each treatment group respectively.|Overall Survival, Overall survival was defined as the time interval (in days) from the randomization date to the date of death. If a participant was still alive at the primary analysis data cut-off date or was lost to follow-up by the primary analysis data cut-off date, survival time was censored at their last contact date or the primary analysis data cut-off date, whichever was first., From randomization until the primary analysis data cut-off date of 19 July 2016 (per protocol); median time on study was 17.6 and 17.3 months in each treatment group respectively.|Percentage of Participants Who Died, From randomization until the primary analysis data cut-off date of 19 July 2016 (per protocol); median time on study was 17.6 and 17.3 months in each treatment group respectively.
