A Clinical Study on the Efficacy and Safety of Paclitaxel Polymeric Micelles and Cisplatin Combined with Cadonilimab As a Neoadjuvant Therapy for Locally Advanced Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant treatment of locally advanced esophageal squamous carcinoma with a PD-1/CTLA-4 bispecific antibody (Cadonilimab) in combination with platinum-containing chemotherapy (Paclitaxel Polymeric Micelles for Injection combined with Cisplatin). Includes pathologic complete remission rates (pCR rates) after 2-4 cycles of Cadonilimab combination chemotherapy. The objective remission rate (ORR), major pathologic remission rate (MPR), R0 resection rate and 2-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (OS) rates, and safety of neoadjuvant treatment of locally advanced esophageal squamous carcinoma with Cadonilimab combined with chemotherapy.

DRUG: Paclitaxel Polymeric Micelles for Injection and Cisplatin combined with Cadonilimab
Pathological complete response (pCR) rates, evaluate pathological complete response rate of primary tumor and locally metastatic lymph nodes after 2-4 cycles of neoadjuvant therapy., From the initiation date of first cycle (each cycle is 21 days) to the date of operation, an average of 12 weeks.
Objective Rate of Effectiveness (ORR), the proportion of patients who achieve PR or CR, From the initiation date of first cycle (each cycle is 21 days) to the date of operation, an average of 12 weeks.|R0 Removal Rate, Rate of microscopically margin-negative resection, From the initiation date of first cycle (each cycle is 21 days) to the date of operation, an average of 12 weeks.|2-year overall survival rate, 2-year overall survival rate, 2 years|2-year disease free survival rate, 2-year disease free survival rate, 2 years|major pathological response (MPR), From the initiation date of first cycle (each cycle is 21 days) to the date of operation, an average of 12 weeks.
