Liver Transplantation for Unresectable Liver Limited Colorectal Metastases
This is a single-arm, single institution pilot registry of liver transplantation in patients with unresectable colorectal liver-only metastases at Weill Cornell Medical College. Patients with liver predominant colorectal liver metastases will be screened based on eligibility criteria in a specified clinical hepatobiliary and colorectal liver metastasis tumor board consisting of the principal and co-investigators, representing medical oncology, transplant surgery, radiology, and pathology. The registry aims to track basic demographic data as well as referral patterns, in addition to specific oncologic data such as tumor burden, extent of disease, extent of disease on explant, recurrence rates, patterns of recurrence and survival rates.
