Effect of Kinesiotaping Augmented By Resistive Exercise on Fatigue, Physical Strength, Quality of Life in Breast Cancer Survivors
The purpose of the study will be to investigate the effect of kinesotaping augmented by resistive exercise on fatigue, muscle strength, and QoL in breast cancer survivors.
Breast Cancer|Fatigue|Quality of Life
OTHER: resistive training|OTHER: kinesiotaping
Assessing the change in fatigue, The Fatigue Severity Scale is a 14-item will be used to measure the severity, frequency and diurnal variation of fatigue, as well as its perceived interference with quality of life., at baseline and after 12 weeks of intervention|Assessing the change in quality of life, By using 36-Item Short Form (SF-36) health survey will be used to assess QoL. The SF-36 questionnaire includes eight multiple-item subscales that evaluate physical function, social functioning, role limitations due to physical problems and role limitations due to emotional problems, mental health, vitality, pain and general health perception. Total score on each SF-36 subscale ranges between 0 and 100. Greater score indicates better QoL, at baseline and after 12 weeks of intervention|Assessing the change in muscle strength, Muscle strength will be assessed using dynamometer at starting and after 12 weeks of the treatment course., at baseline and after 12 weeks of intervention
The present study will provide an evidence base to women's health care providers about the effect of strength training augmented by kinesotaping on fatigue, QoL and muscle strength in breast cancer women compared to strength training alone
