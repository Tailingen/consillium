A Clinical Study of Apatinib in Patients With Local Progressive/Metastatic Refractory Thyroid Cancer
This is a single-center, open-label, single arm，exploratory clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of Apatinib in patients with local progressive/metastatic refractory thyroid cancer.
Refractory Cancer
DRUG: Apatinib
objective response rate, ORR is defined as the percentage of subjects having achieved confirmed Complete Response+Partial Response as best overall response according to Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors(RECIST 1.1)., 1 year
progression-free-survival(PFS), From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 12 months., 1 year|disease control rate(DCR), Investigators will assess treatment response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1（RECIST1.1）., 1 year|serum Tg、TgAb、calcitonin, Evaluating the change of serum level of Tg，TgAb or calcitonin,assessed up to 12 months., 1 year|Adverse Events(AEs), Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0., 1 year
This is a single-center, open-label, single arm，exploratory clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of Apatinib in patients with local progressive/metastatic refractory thyroid cancer.

The primary endpoint is objective response rate(ORR),the secondary endpoints include progression-free-survival(PFS)；disease control rate(DCR);serum Tg、TgAb、calcitonin；safety.

If any case happens as following,including withdrawing informed consent form(ICF)、unbearable toxicity or adverse reactions、other conditions which investigators think the patients are unsuitable to go on trail,the patient will not go on trial any longer,or every subject will obtain study treatment until tumor progress with CT/MRI proof.The indicators of efficacy and safety will be always observed during the trail process.
