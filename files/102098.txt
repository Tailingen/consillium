Masitinib Plus Docetaxel in Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer
Study of masitinib plus docetaxel as first-line chemotherapy in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.
Metastatic Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Masitinib|DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Prednisone|DRUG: Placebo
Progression Free Survival, Progression Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the randomization date until the date of earliest evidence of disease progression or death, for participants who progressed or died before subsequent cancer therapy. Disease progression will be assessed according to the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 (PCWG2) recommendations., From day of randomization to disease progression or death, assessed for a maximum of 60 months
Overall Survival, Overall survival (OS) is defined as time in months from the randomization date to the date of death due to any cause. If a patient is not known to have died, then OS will be censored at the date of last known date patient alive., From day of randomization to death, assessed for a maximum of 60 months
The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of masitinib in combination with docetaxel and prednisone with respect to placebo in combination with docetaxel and prednisone in the treatment of first line metastatic Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC). Approximately 580 patients will be randomized in 2 groups with a ratio 1:1. The primary outcome measure is progression free survival. Masitinib is a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is thought to promote survival via modulation of immunostimulation-mediated anticancer effects and modulation of the tumor microenvironment.
