Studying Tumor Tissue Samples From Patients With Soft Tissue Sarcoma
RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

PURPOSE: This research study is looking at tumor tissue samples from patients with soft tissue sarcoma.
Sarcoma
GENETIC: DNA analysis|GENETIC: gene expression analysis|GENETIC: protein expression analysis|GENETIC: reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction|GENETIC: western blotting|OTHER: immunohistochemistry staining method|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis
Identification of molecular targets that would improve the diagnosis, prognosis, and/or treatment of STS, 3 months
OBJECTIVES:

* To develop a pilot program for the collection, archiving, and experimental analyses of soft tissue sarcomas (STS).
* To obtain STS tumors from cancer patients undergoing tumor removal or core needle biopsies.
* To evaluate cellular and molecular factors involved in STS oncogenesis by studying samples derived from human tumor specimens.
* To develop an accompanying bioinformatics database of the demographics of STS patients from which tumor specimens are derived for experimental study.

OUTLINE: Tumor tissue samples are analyzed for gene and protein expression by cDNA microarray analysis, RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, in vitro transformation assays, RNA interference, and Western blot or immunoprecipitation.
