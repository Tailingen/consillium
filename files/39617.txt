A Phase 1 Dose-escalation Study of UGN-301 in Patients With Recurrent Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC)
This study is being conducted to evaluate the safety and determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of UGN-301 (zalifrelimab) administered intravesically as monotherapy and in combination with other agents in patients with recurrent NMIBC.

This master protocol will comprise multiple treatment arms designed to independently investigate intravesical delivery of UGN-301 either as monotherapy or in combination with other agents. Initial study treatment arms will include:

* UGN-301 monotherapy
* UGN-301 + UGN-201 (imiquimod) in combination
* UGN-301 + gemcitabine in combination

Additional study treatment arms investigating UGN-301 in combination with other agents may be added in the future.

The study will evaluate escalating doses of UGN-301 to determine the biologically effective dose (BED) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of UGN-301 either as monotherapy or in combination with other agents.

When evaluated in combination with other agents, the UGN-301 dose will begin at least 1 dose level lower than the highest dose level cleared in the monotherapy arm, or 1 dose level lower than the RP2D.

Eligible patients in each study treatment arm will enter a 12-week Induction Period.

Patients with noninvasive papillary carcinoma and/or tumor that invades the lamina propria (Ta and/or T1) who do not have disease recurrence and patients with carcinoma in situ (CIS) who have a complete response (CR) at 3 months after the start of treatment will return to the clinic for a Safety Follow-up Visit at 6 months after the start of treatment.

Ta/T1 patients without disease recurrence and CIS patients with CR at 6 months may enter an Optional Maintenance Period of up to 9 months.
