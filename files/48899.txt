Clinical Evaluation of Navigated 3D Ultrasound Multicentre Study
3D ultrasound is a new modality used in image guided neurosurgery. a multicentre study is started for the evaluation of this tool as a means for achieving total resection of brain tumors at greater safety.
Brain Neoplasms
DEVICE: use of navigated 3D ultrasound during surgery
The degree of resection as judged by the surgeon is recorded at the end of surgery for each patient, and then compared with the postoperative MRI. Neurological status before and after surgery, QOL before surgery and at follow-up as well as survival is recorded.
