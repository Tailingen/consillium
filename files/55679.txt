Feasibility Study to Treat Lung Cancer With the Permanently Implantable LDR CivaSheetÂ®
This is a feasibility study to determine the usefulness of a brachytherapy device that utilizes active components (palladium-103) of standard devices in a novel configuration, which may benefit lung cancer patients by reducing the radiation dose to critical structures, such as the heart wall, while giving a therapeutic dose to diseased tissue, such as at a surgical margin.
