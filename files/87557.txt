Hospice care for terminally ill patients with metastatic cancer improves quality of life, pain control, and potentially also survival when patients are enrolled early.1-3 However, hospice programs are often seen by patients and their caregivers as the last resort after exhaustion of all effective treatment options. The need to revoke active treatment (for all hospice patients with cancer outside of the VA system) discourages hospice enrollment.

This study aims to understand and analyze barriers to access specifically for short course palliative radiation therapy in cancer patients enrolled in hospice.
