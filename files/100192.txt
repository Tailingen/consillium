HemosprayTM for Gastrointestinal Bleeding From Cancer
Title: The efficacy of hemostatic powder TC-325 versus standard endoscopic treatment for gastrointestinal bleeding from malignancy; a multi-center randomized trial

Background: Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding arising from malignant tumors is increasingly recognized as a result of oncological advances and improved detection methods. However, conventional endoscopic hemostatic methods are not reliable to control bleeding. It has a trend to be an effective hemostasis method for active GI bleeding from tumor, however, in view of the lack of RCTs and large-scale studies, the efficacy of TC-325 is still inconclusive.

Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of TC325 in endoscopic hemostasis treatment for malignant gastrointestinal hemorrhage.The 24-hour, 72-hour, 30-day, 90-day and 180-day rebleeding rate were assessed as the outcomes of treatment as well as 6-month mortality.

Study design: Single-blinded, multi-center, randomized-control trial study The intervention (experimental) arm: TC-325 alone (define failure if continued bleeding despite application of 1 syringes) The control arm: Standard of (traditional) endoscopic treatments

\*\* Crossover is possible. Inclusion criteria: Patients with acute upper or lower GIB from a lesion that is actively bleeding at index endoscopy (spurting or oozing) and is suspected to be malignant or diagnosed as malignancy from previous tissue diagnosis.

Exclusion criteria: Patients less than 18 years old, previously included in the trial, ECOG score 3 or 4, pregnancy/lactation, and/or bleeding from GI sources suspected of not being malignant. If an endoscopist is unsure of the malignant likelihood of the lesion, he/she will not be enrolled.

Sample size: 112 in total

Duration of participation for each volunteer: 180 days
