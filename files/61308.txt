Men's Prostate Awareness Church Training
The objective of the Prostate Cancer Education in African American Churches project is to develop and evaluate a spiritually-based educational intervention for Informed Decision Making (IDM) for prostate cancer screening to be delivered to African American men in church settings.
Prostate Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Men's Workshops|BEHAVIORAL: Co-Educational Workshops
Informed Decision making for Prostate Cancer Screening, IDM for prostate cancer screening for African American men participating in a church-based group educational workshops will be measured at baseline and 12 months. Survey assessments items for informed decision making include: stage of decision making, preference for decision making, and self-efficacy for decision making., Baseline to 12 month follow-up
Theory-based measures, prostate cancer knowledge, and prostate cancer screening, Health Belief Model-based scales including perceived benefits of screening; perceived barriers to screening; self-efficacy for screening; and knowledge including prostate cancer knowledge; knowledge about the prostate cancer screening controversy; and prostate cancer screening through self-report receipt of prostate specific antigen test and digital rectal examination, Change from baseline to 12 month follow-up
The specific aims of the project are to 1) develop, and 2) test the efficacy of a spiritually-based cancer communication intervention to increase IDM for prostate cancer screening among African American men in church settings, and including women as supportive "health partners".

A randomized controlled trial is utilized, in which churches will be randomized to: 1) male-only educational groups; and 2) co-educational groups where women supportive "health partners" are invited to attend with the men in dyads, and then break out into men's and women's discussion groups. These two approaches are compared through use of cluster randomized design to determine whether the addition of the women health partner increases the intervention efficacy in the study outcome of informed decision making for prostate cancer screening.
