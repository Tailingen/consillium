An Observational Study to Evaluate the Real-World Clinical Management and Outcomes of ALK-Positive Advanced NSCLC Participants Treated With Alectinib
This study aims to characterize the clinical management and outcomes of participants diagnosed with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who are being treated with alectinib in real-world clinical practice.
