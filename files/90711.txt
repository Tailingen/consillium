FUSCC Refractory TNBC Platform Study (FUTURE2.0)
This is a Phase II, open-label, Single-center platform study research based on molecular subtypes to explore precision therapy in refractory triple-negative breast cancer.

Overall response rate (ORR), The proportion of participants whose best outcome is complete remission or partial remission (according to RECIST1.1), Randomization until the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, which ever occurs first, through the completion of study (approximately 3 years)
Progression Free Survival (PFS), Time to progressive disease (according to RECIST1.1), Randomization until the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, which ever occurs first, through the completion of study (approximately 3 years)|Duration of Response (DoR), Duration of whose best outcome is complete remission or partial remission (according to RECIST1.1), Randomization until the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, which ever occurs first, through the completion of study(approximately 3 years)|Disease Control Rate (DCR), The proportion of patients with the best overall response of CR, PR, or stable disease (SD), Randomization until the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, which ever occurs first, through the completion of study(approximately 3 years)|Overall Survival (OS), Time to death due to any cause, Randomization to death from any cause, through the end of study (approximately 3 years)|CTCAE scale (V5.0), To evaluate the rate of adverse effects of patient by the standard CTCAE scale (V5.0), Up to One Year during follow-up
This is a Phase II, open-label, Single-center platform studyï¼ŒBased on FUSCC four TNBC subtypes and the results of the previous FUTURE trial, the investigators designed this platform trial, which for combined the TNBC subtyping and genomic sequencing-guided precision targeted therapy for refractory metastatic TNBC patients. In this trial, refractory mTNBC patients eligible for inclusion can be divided into various precision treatment group according to molecular typing and subtyping to evaluate the efficacy and safety of multiple precision targeted treatment. The research therapy arm can be updated with the update of basic translational research in our center, especially the refinement of typing, the discovery of new targets and the development of novel targeted drugs.
