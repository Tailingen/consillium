This is an observational study evaluating the design, safety and efficacy of OralViome Cancer Testing system in the early detection of Oral and Throat Cancers using saliva metatranscriptomic.

A total of 475 participants will be recruited, including 4 different cohorts: 1) cancer free patients, 2) patients with Oral Potentially Malignant Disease (OPMD), 3) patients with Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC), and 4) patients with OroPharyngeal Cancer (OPC). OSCC and OPC participants will be recruited from secondary care facilities, OPMD and cancer free participants will be recruited from primary care facilities.

Participants will complete health questionnaires and collect saliva samples using at home/ in clinic kits provided by Viome. The duration of study participation will be 1 clinic visit for cancer free participants, and up to 1 year for those with OSCC/OPC/OPMD.
