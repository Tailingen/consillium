The Effectiveness of Diode Laser 980-nm in Iraqi Face Hemangioma: a Randomized Within Patients Trial
In an academic, government clinic, uni-center, randomized within patients trial study of the effects of 980-nm diode laser treatment included 15 cases of facial hemangiomas in patients with a history of discomfort due to lesions that were not suitable for removal using traditional methods. The study was carried out at the University of Baghdad/Institute of Laser for Postgraduate Studies/Laser Medicine Research Clinics from 15 October 2018 to 15 April 2019. Primary end-point is improvement of conditions at 6 months. Secondary end-points are quality of life, disappear lesions and safety administration of diode laser. Each patient received 12 sessions at two-week intervals. Lesions were photographed before and after laser treatment and digital image histograms were generated as a graphical representation of the tonal distribution.

Following treatment, the lesions were less elevated, smoother in texture, and the color changed from dark red to light pink.

There is a need to improve the treatment of face hemangiomas. Results from this randomized within patient trial will serve as preliminary evidence of the future role of diode laser in hemangioma treatment and a basis for design and power estimations of future studies. Based on the skin texture, color and elevation of the hemangioma as well as patient satisfaction, this type of laser is a safe and effective modality for the treatment of facial hemangioma in Iraqi patients.
Hemangioma
PROCEDURE: Diode laser 980-nm
Area of Hemangioma lesions, Measured area of lesions by tape measure by centimeters, 4th week|Color of lesion, By inspection color of lesion change from dark red to bright red or disappear, 4 weeks|Shape of lesion, Clinical exam by inspection, we look to ugly shape of lesion, may be change for better or disappear, 4 weeks
