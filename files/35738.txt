Surveillance For New Lung Primaries
The primary goal of this study is to determine the prevalence of tracheobronchial carcinomas in patients with a history of squamous cell cancer of the aerodigestive tract who have been treated with a curative intent and remain disease free. Detection of pre-invasive and invasive lesions (moderate to severe dysplasia, CIS) with fluorescence bronchoscopic surveillance may help to define the natural history of these lesions and allow earlier intervention should they progress to invasive lesions.
