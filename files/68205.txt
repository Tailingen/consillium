Bladder EpiCheck European Haematuria Study
The goal of this observational study is to further validate the sensitivity and specificity of Bladder EpiCheck in primary detection of urothelial carcinoma in participants aged 45 years or older presenting with haematuria, compared to cystoscopy and pathology, if performed.

Participants will provide a voided urine sample, and data from standard of care haematuria work-up will be collected.
