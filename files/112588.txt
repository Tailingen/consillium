Safety and Efficacy of RD133 in Subjects With Relapsed or Refractory MSLN-Positive Solid Tumors
This study is a single-center exploratory clinical trial. It is estimated that 9-24 subjects will be enrolled. The "3+3" dose escalation design is adopted. The main purpose is to evaluate the safety of RD133 in the treatment of subjects with relapsed or refractory MSLN-positive solid tumors and explore the Recommend phase II dose of RD133 in the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory MSLN-positive solid tumors.

Leukapheresis procedure will be performed to manufacture RD133 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) modified T cells. Bridging therapy is allowed between PBMC collection and lymphodepletion. Lymphodepletion with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide was performed for three consecutive days. After 1-day rest, subjects will receive a single dose infusion of RD133 at 1.0, 3.0, or 6.0x 10\^6 CAR+ T cells/Kg. Subjects will be followed in the study for a minimum of 2 years after RD133 infusion. Long-term follow-up for lentiviral vector safety will be followed for up to 15 years after RD133 infusion.
