New Serum Biomarkers for Monitoring Early Diagnosis of Ovarian Cancer Recurrence
In this study, mass spectrometry was used to analyze immune inflammation-related protein complexes, post-translational modified glycopeptide omics and tumor-related metabolomics in serum, respectively, in order to find potential metabolic small molecule biomarkers or marker profiles that can be used for early diagnosis of cancer recurrence.

Time cohort study: patients with confirmed ovarian epithelial cancer at different time cutoff points before treatment, after surgery, during chemotherapy, and after chemotherapy, until clinically confirmed patients relapse. At least 50 patients are expected to be enrolled.
