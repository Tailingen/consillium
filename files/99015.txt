Intra-Arterial Chemotherapy for Newly Diagnosed, Residual, or Recurrent Atypical Choroid Plexus Papilloma and Choroid Plexus Carcinoma Prior to Second-Look Surgery
This study will test the safety and efficacy of intra-arterial chemotherapy in subjects with newly diagnosed, residual, or recurrent atypical choroid plexus papilloma and choroid plexus carcinoma prior to a second surgery.

It is believed that intra-arterial chemotherapy will be safe and feasible for this population and will result in decreased tumor size, which may further improve the goals of a second-look surgery.

Safety of intra-arterial chemotherapy in subjects with ACPP and CPC, measured by the number of serious adverse events that are reported as at least possible related to the intervention that occur in subjects on the trial, Through study completion, a little over a year for each subject
The number of successful angiography procedures, determined by examination of vasculature and assessment of catheter placement, On Day 1 of the trial for each subject|The number of patients with a tumor volume reduction response, determined by MRI assessments, Between 4-6 weeks after intra-arterial chemotherapy|The proportion of patients with a tumor volume reduction response, determined by MRI assessments, Between 4-6 weeks after intra-arterial chemotherapy|The number of patients with a tumor vascularity reduction response, determined by MRI assessments, Between 4-6 weeks after intra-arterial chemotherapy|The proportion of patients with a tumor vascularity reduction response, determined by MRI assessments, Between 4-6 weeks after intra-arterial chemotherapy|The success of second look surgery determined by measuring the extent of tumor resection, Around 7 weeks after intra-arterial chemotherapy, during second look surgery|The success of second look surgery determined by amount of blood loss, Around 7 weeks after intra-arterial chemotherapy, during second look surgery|The success of second look surgery determined by percent of blood loss, Around 7 weeks after intra-arterial chemotherapy, during second look surgery
Extent of pathology correlation to tumor vascularity and tumor viability, Determined by comparison of pathology reports and surgical outcomes, Around 7 weeks after intra-arterial chemotherapy
The intent of this study is to determine if intra-arterial chemotherapy is a safe and effective option for subjects with atypical choroid plexus papilloma and choroid plexus carcinoma prior to receiving second-look surgery. Angiography occurs when a catheter is inserted through the subjects vasculature to the major vessels that supply cerebral circulation. Subjects on this trial will undergo a a cerebral angiogram to determine the ideal arteries to use for drug infusion. Once identified, chemotherapy will be delivered through the catheter directly to the site of tumor.
