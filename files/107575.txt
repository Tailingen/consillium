A Trial of Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Patients With Residual Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) DNA Following Radiotherapy
The purpose of this trial is to study the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy using gemcitabine and cisplatin in high risk NPC patients with residual EBV DNA following primary radiotherapy with or without concurrent cisplatin.
Nasopharyngeal Cancer
DRUG: Adjuvant chemotherapy (gemcitabine and cisplatin)
Relapse free survival, 5 years
Overall survival, Overall survival is defined as the duration from the date of randomization to the date of death due to all causes or censored at the date of last follow-up, 5 years|Loco-regional control, 5 years|Metastasis-free survival, 5 years|Toxicity of adjuvant chemotherapy, 6 months|Correlation of plasma EBV DNA and PET/CT scan with clinical course and outcome, 5 years
* The standard treatment for nasopharynx cancer is a course of radiotherapy with or without concurrent chemotherapy. This will cure about 80% of patients. For the 20% who developed recurrence or metastases, the prognosis is poor.
* Elevated EBV-DNA in plasma at end of radiotherapy has been shown to predict disease recurrence and may be a marker of subclinical residual disease.
* This study aims to test whether adjuvant treatment with 6 cycles of a modern chemotherapy regimen (gemcitabine and cisplatin combination) can improve the survival of these high risk patients of nasopharynx cancer who have elevated EBV-DNA after completion of their radiotherapy.
