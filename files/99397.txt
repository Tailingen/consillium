Developing a New MRI Technique to Understand Changes in Brain Tumors After Treatment
The purpose of this study is to develop and test a new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique to see if it can be used to tell the difference between tumor growth from worsening of cancer and growth from the effects of treatment in participants who have brain tumors treated with radiation therapy called stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: CEST-MRF
Change of Rapid chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) imaging with magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF)/CEST-MRF parameters with and without motion, Develop a rapid and robust 3D CEST-MRF pulse sequence for clinical scanners using our preclinical CEST-MRF pulse sequence as a basis by evaluating the changes of the 6 CEST-MRF parameters with and without motion. These parameters include the water T1 and T2 relaxation (T1w,T2w), amide exchange rate (ksw) and volume fraction (fs) and the semi-solid exchange rate (kssw) and volume fraction (fss)., Up to 3 years
Create CEST-MRF parameter maps, Develop an MRI physics-guided artificial intelligence approach to improve acquisition and reconstruction of multiparametric data, Up to 3 years|Measure longitudinal changes in CEST-MRF after SRS, Evaluate CEST-MRF changes before and after radiation therapy to assess potential role as predictive imaging biomarker for brain metastases, Up to 3 years
