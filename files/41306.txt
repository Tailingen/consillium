De-escalation Protocols in HPV-related Oropharyngeal Carcinoma in Chinese Populations
Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related oropharyngeal carcinoma are exquisitely radiosensitive. Several studies attempted to reduce the toxicities of treatments through reduced-dose radiation and showed promising results, but all data were collected from non-Chinese areas. Like nasopharyngeal carcinoma, oropharyngeal carcinoma may have different biological behavior and relationship with HPV infection. So the investigators studied whether toxicities reducing treatment with reduced radiation dose and omitted concurrent chemotherapy after good response to induction chemotherapy would maintain survival outcomes while improving tolerability for patients with HPV-positive oropharyngeal carcinoma.
