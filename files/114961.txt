Prospective Analysis of Effect of Collagen Wrap Conduit on Radial and Ulnar Nerve Function Following Radial/Ulnar Forearm Free Flap Harvest
The purpose of this study is to determine whether collagen nerve conduits placed on exposed radial and ulnar nerves during radial and ulnar forearm free flap harvests will reduce the occurrence and degree of sensory nerve deficit.
