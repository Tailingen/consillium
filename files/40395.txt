Home Based Tele-exercise for People With Chronic Neurological Impairments
To assess the impact of a 12-week virtual seated physical intervention on cardiovascular health and wellness in people with chronic neurological impairments (CNI).
Neurologic Disorder|Stroke|Spinal Cord Injuries|Cerebral Palsy|Hemiplegia|Hemiparesis|Multiple Sclerosis|Parkinson Disease|Trauma, Brain|Transverse Myelitis|Friedreich Ataxia
BEHAVIORAL: Seated exercise
Change in heart rate, Heart rate on last day of training compared to heart rate on first day of training, Within one week before the first intervention session to within one week after the end of intervention
Perceived Wellness Survey, a 36-item instrument used to measure an individual's perceived health status in physical, psychological, emotional, intellectual, spiritual, and social wellness constructs, Within one week before the first intervention session to within one week after the end of intervention|Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale, a self-assessment measure of enjoyment with their current physical activity, Within one week before the first intervention session to within one week after the end of intervention|Short Form-36 Health Survey, measures physical health and mental health, Within one week before the first intervention session to within one week after the end of intervention|Numerical pain rating, standardized instrument for pain assessment in clinical and research practice. It is an 11-point scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (the most intense pain) at rest and during movement, Within one week before the first intervention session to within one week after the end of intervention|Borg's Rating Scale of Perceived Exertion, standardized measure to evaluate perceived intensity of exertion, effort, and fatigue during physical exercise, Within one week before the first intervention session to within one week after the end of intervention|Reason for exercise inventory, is a 24-item scale to assess the reason that motivates a person to exercise, Within one week before the first intervention session to within one week after the end of intervention
This study aims to examine how effective seated Zoom exercise classes are for a person with CNI for addressing cardiovascular health, physical wellness and quality of life. If these classes prove to be effective, online platforms could be a viable avenue for those with CNI to exercise and increase/maintain wellness without having to leave their homes. The investigators are also attempting to determine if a class with a live instructor vs a pre-recorded class has an effect on motivation, compliance, exertion and modifications/safety.

The entire process, including screening and consenting, will be done via Zoom and Redcap, potentially providing a blueprint for the future studies. This process can enable participants to participate in studies with minimal inconvenience, expense and effort of traveling for the consent process.
