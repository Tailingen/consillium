Microbiota and Metabolomics of Intestinal Type of Gastric Cancer
Compare with the gastric cavity without cancerous transformation in atrophic gastritis, analyze the microbiota and metabolomics changes in intestinal type of gastric cancer under the background of atrophic gastritis, and explore the relevant mechanisms.
Gastric Cancer
Metabolomics results of lesions and atrophic gastritis., liquid chromatograph mass spectrometer metabolic profling, 1year
microbiomics of lesions and atrophic gastritis., 16SrRNA analysis, 1 year
degree of gastric atrophy,, According to the classification of Kimura-Takemoto Classification （C1-O3）, 1year|endoscopic observation, NBI observation of atrophic background color, surrounding color of the lesion, lesion color, presence or absence of boundary transition zones, scattered intact glands within the lesion,presence of incomplete mesh patterns, and presence or absence of other early gastric cancer endoscopic manifestations., 1year
This study adopts a prospective cohort study. The expected recruitment time for all participants is 6 months, and all cases are cases who would receive magnifying endoscopy examination. The extent of atrophy and the presence of early gastric cancer are determined under magnifying endoscopy. Cases are chose into the gastric cancer group and atrophic gastritis group in a 1:1 ratio. There are 16 cases of intestinal type of gastric cancer under the background of atrophic gastritis, and 16 cases of atrophic gastritis without gastric cancer matched according to gender, age, and degree of gastric atrophy, totaling 32 cases. Analyze the characteristics of early gastric cancer under endoscopy, investigate the changes in microbiota and metabolomics of intestinal type of gastric cancer under the background of atrophic gastritis, and explore the relevant mechanisms.
