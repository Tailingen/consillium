Anti-CD38 Antibody With KRAS Vaccine and Anti-PD-1 Antibody in Subjects With Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma and Refractory Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
The goal of this clinical trial is to test the safety and tolerability of anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody (mAb), daratumumab, in combination with KRAS vaccine (Targovax TG-01/Stimulon QS-21) when given with anti-PD-1 (programmed cell death protein 1) mAb (nivolumab) in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The main questions it aims to answer are:

* How well does daratumumab and nivolumab, when given with a vaccine, control or stop these types of cancer?
* How well does participants bodies handle these study drugs?
* Does this combination of study drugs help participants live longer? Participants will receive daratumumab, nivolumab with KRAS vaccine and have regular tests and procedures to follow how the participants are doing on these study drugs.
Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma|Refractory Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Daratumumab|BIOLOGICAL: KRAS vaccine|DRUG: Nivolumab
Objective Response Rate (ORR) (Efficacy), Evaluation of response by ORR by irRECIST criteria. Response classification will follow the irRECIST criteria and will be defined as PR or CR. Patients who are lost to follow-up without a valid response assessment will be classified as NR (non-responder, progression). The ORR will be computed for all patients with at least one cycle of the study drug., every 8 weeks, approximately 2 years
Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability], Incidence rate of Adverse Events, From start of intervention until 30 days following discontinuation of intervention, approximately 2 years|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS will be defined as the time in days from study entry until progression or death., at 6 months and 9 months|Duration of Response (DOR), DoR is defined as the length of time tumor continues to respond to the treatment., approximately 3 years|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), CBR classification will follow the irRECIST criteria and will be defined as the percentage of patients who achieved stable disease (SD) or better response., approximately 2 years|Overall Survival, OS will be defined as the time in days from study entry until death. All events of death will be included, regardless of whether the event occurred while the subject was still taking study drug, or after the subject discontinued study drug., approximately 3 years
