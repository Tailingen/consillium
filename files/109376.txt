Comparative Effectiveness of MRgFUS Versus CTgRFA for Osteoid Osteomas
Osteoid osteomas are painful, benign bone tumors that occur most frequently in young males between ages 10 and 20 years. The goal of the proposed study is based on the premise that MRgFUS is noninferior to CT-guided radiofrequency ablation (CTgRFA), in terms of pain reduction following treatment of osteoid osteomas, and offers possible improvements with regards to 1) post-procedural pain, 2) clinical resource utilization, 3) patient experience, and/or 4) adverse events. The data from the current study would provide clinicians important information in deciding between treatment options for ablation of osteoid osteomas.
