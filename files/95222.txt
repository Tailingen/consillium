Efficacy and Feasibility of Combining FOLFIRINOX and Stereotactic Radiotherapy for Patients With Irresectable Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer.
The purpose of this study is to investigate whether combining FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy and stereotactic radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer leads to an increase in survival.
