A Phase Ib Study of HS-10370 in Addition to Other Anti-cancer Therapies in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a Phase Ib study that will evaluate the Safety, Tolerability , Pharmacokinetics, Activity and Immunogenicity of HS-10370 in Combination With Other Anti-cancer Therapies in Chinese patients with KRAS G12C mutation advanced or metastatic solid tumors, especially in and Colorectal cancer(CRC) and non-Small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Number of Participants with Adverse Event(s) (AEs), An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. Severity is determined according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 5.0 (NCI CTCAE v5.0), From Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1) to disease progression or death, up to 2 years (each cycle is 14 days).
Overall Response Rate (ORR), Percentage of Participants who Achieve a Best Overall Response (BOR) of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR).ORR by the Investigator According to RECIST v1.1, From Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1) to disease progression or death, up to 2 years (each cycle is 14 days).|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Percentage of Participants who Achieve a BOR of CR, PR, or Stable Disease (SD).DCR by the Investigator According to RECIST v1.1, From Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1) to disease progression or death, up to 2 years (each cycle is 14 days).|Time to Response (TTR), TTR by the Investigator According to RECIST v1.1, Time from Cycle 1 Day 1 until the date that measurement criteria for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) are first met, up to 2 years (each cycle is 14 days).|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR by the Investigator According to RECIST v1.1, Date of first evidence of CR or PR to date of disease progression or death from any cause, approximately 2 years|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS by the Investigator According to RECIST v1.1, Date of first evidence of CR or PR to date of disease progression or death from any cause, approximately 2 years|Overall survival (OS), Defined as the time from C1D1 to death from any cause by the Investigator According to RECIST v1.1, Cycle 1 Day 1 to date of death from any cause, up to 5 years (each cycle is 14 days)|Plasma Concentrations of HS-10370, Defined as the time from C1D1 to death from any cause, Cycle 1 Day 1 to date of death from any cause. Various timepoints from Cycle 1 Day 1 through study treatment discontinuation, up to 2 years. (each cycle is 14 days)|Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), Cmax is defined as maximum observed serum concentration obtained directly from the observed concentration-time data., Cycle 1 Day 1 to date of death from any cause, up to 2 years. Various timepoints from Cycle 1 Day 1 through study treatment discontinuation (each cycle is 14 days)|Time of maximum concentration (Tmax), Tmax is defined as the time required for a drug to reach peak concentration in plasma., Cycle 1 Day 1 to date of death from any cause, up to 2 years. Various timepoints from Cycle 1 Day 1 through study treatment discontinuation (each cycle is 14 days)
