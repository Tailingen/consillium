Study of Hsp90 Inhibitor, STA-9090 for Relapsed or Refractory Small Cell Lung Cancer
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a chemotherapy and radiotherapy sensitive tumor, but with very high rates of relapse and metastasis, resulting in a very poor outcome. Among limited-stage patients, the relapse rate is at least 80% and among extensive-stage patients, the relapse rate is 95-98%. The impetus to develop more effective therapies against novel targets in SCLC is therefore high.

Hsp-90 inhibitors are a new class of drugs with important anti-malignant potential in a variety of tumor types because of the reliance of multiple oncoproteins on Hsp90 function. Although small cell neuroendocrine tumors generally carry many mutated oncoproteins, without clearly defined clients for Hsp90 mediating inhibitor effects in these cells, a recent study demonstrated that Hsp90 inhibition causes massive apoptosis by activating the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in a number of SCLC cell lines. SCLC is a particularly attractive target for apoptosis inducing drugs because of high growth rates and evidence of molecular alterations affecting apoptotic mechanisms.

STA-9090 is a novel, small-molecule inhibitor of Hsp90. Unlike earlier generations of Hsp90 inhibitors, STA-9090 has been shown to be a potent inducer of apoptosis in a variety of cell lines and has anti-tumor activity in multiple types of human xenografts. As was seen with other Hsp90 inhibitors, STA-9090 also induces apoptosis in a number of SCLC cell lines.

Based on the anti-tumor potential seen pre-clinically with Hsp90 inhibition, the potent effects of STA-9090 seen pre-clinically as compared with other inhibitors in the same class, as well as early data suggesting safety and tolerability of this drug in the Phase I setting, we propose to study the single-agent activity of STA-9090 in a Phase II trial of patients with relapsed or refractory small cell lung cancer.

DRUG: STA-9090
8-Week Progression-Free Rate, The 8-week progression free rate is defined as the percentage of participants achieving complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) based on RECIST 1.1 criteria by the time of the first disease assessment (8 weeks). Per RECIST 1.1 for target lesions: CR is complete disappearance of all target lesions; PR is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum LD; and SD is neither sufficient decrease to qualify as PR nor sufficient increase to qualify as progressive disease (PD). PD is at least a 20% increase in sum LD, taking as reference the smallest sum on study with at least 5 mm absolute increase. Response needed confirmation within 4 weeks. For non-target lesions, progression-free means no new lesions or unequivocal progression on existing non-target lesions or not evaluated., Disease was evaluated radiographically at baseline and every 8 weeks on treatment; Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Relevant for this endpoint was the first 8 week disease re-assessment.
Overall Response Rate, The objective response rate (ORR) was defined as the percentage of participants achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on RECIST 1.1 criteria on treatment. Per RECIST 1.1 for target lesions: CR is complete disappearance of all target lesions and PR is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum LD. PR or better overall response assumes at a minimum incomplete response/stable disease (SD) for the evaluation of non-target lesions and absence of new lesions., Disease was evaluated radiographically at baseline and every 8 weeks on treatment. Treatment duration was a median of 2 cycles (parallel to 2 months given the 4 week cycle length) and range of 1-2 cycles in this study cohort.|Progression-Free Survival, Progression-free survival (PFS) based on the Kaplan-Meier method is defined as the time from study entry to the earliest documentation of disease progression (PD) based on RECIST 1.1 criteria or death. Participants alive without evidence of PD were censored at the date of last adequate disease assessment. Per RECIST 1.1 for target lesions PD is at least a 20% increase in sum LD, taking as reference the smallest sum on study with at least 5 mm absolute increase. For non-target lesions, progression is appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression on existing non-target lesions., Disease was evaluated radiographically at baseline and every 8 weeks on treatment. Treatment duration was a median of 2 cycles (parallel to 2 months given the 4 week cycle length) and range of 1-2 cycles in this study cohort.|Overall Survival, Overall survival estimated using Kaplan-Meier (KM) methods is defined as the time from study entry to death due to any cause or date last known alive., Long-term follow-up for survival occurred every 4 weeks. As of this analysis, follow-up among survivors was a median (range) of 11.5 months (0.9-47.9).
OBJECTIVES:

Primary Objective

* To determine the progression-free rate at 8 weeks in participants with relapsed or refractory small cell lung cancer who have received \<3 prior regimens of systemic chemotherapy

Secondary Objectives

* To determine the response rate using radiologic assessment according to standard RECIST 1.1 criteria
* To determine median progression free survival and overall survival
* To characterize the toxicity profile of STA-9090 in this patient population

Exploratory Objectives

* To analyze levels of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from blood samples obtained serially throughout the study and assess the utility of measuring these cell subsets as a marker of disease burden as well as response to therapy
* To analyze the participant population by identification of gene expression profiles (measured in RNA from available tumor biopsies) associated with the efficacy and resistance to STA-9090
