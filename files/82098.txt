Detecting the Changes of Swallowing Function in Oral Cancer Patients
The evidence of swallowing changes in tongue cancer patients is still limited. This study aimed to investigated the swallowing changes in these patients by using the videofluoroscopy (VFSS) and high resolution impedance manometry (HRIM).
Swallowing Function
pharyngeal pressure, the contraction of pharyngeal muscle, 15 minutes during the examination postoperative 1 month
Objective: to investigated the swallowing changes in tongue cancer patients by using the videofluoroscopy (VFSS) and high resolution impedance manometry (HRIM).

Methods: 1. patients are fulfilled tongue cancer diagnosis; 2.they will undergo VFSS and HRIM examinations before or after surgery if they experience discomfort while swallowing.
