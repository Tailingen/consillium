The Relationship Between Adipokines, Obesity and Insulin Resistance in Women With Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome
To evaluate possible clinical effects of adipokines , ( ghrelin, resistin and adiponectin), in obese and non-obese patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome
serum ghrelin level, measuring ghrelin, and ) in the three groups, 24 hours|serum resistin level, serum resistin level in the three groups, 24 hours|serum adiponectin level, serum adiponectin level in the three groups, 24 hours
Glucose/Insulin ratio, fasting glucose and insulin in three groups, 24 hours|serum testosterone level, serum testosterone level in three groups, 24 hours after labor
Seventy selected PCOS patients will be recruited for this study, and will be divided into two groups based on their body mass index (BMI): 35 obese (BMIâ‰¥ 25 kg/m2, group A), 35 non-obese (BMI\<25 kg/m2, group B). In addition, 35 healthy non-obese women (BMI\<25 kg/m2) will bw enrolled as the control (group C). Serum levels of FSH (follicle stimulating hormone), LH (luteinizing hormone), T(testosterone), glucose, insulin, adiponectin, resistin and resistin will bw detected, and compared the differences of them among three groups
