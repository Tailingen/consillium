A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial for Feasibility of Administering an AR Game to Postoperative Pediatric Cancer Patients
This is a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of SpellBound's AR (augmented reality)-enabled scavenger hunt use among 20 pediatric cancer patients undergoing surgery.
Pediatric Cancer|Surgery
DEVICE: ARISE with AR|DEVICE: ARISE without AR
Percentage of patients who receive the AR game who are able to initiate the game and activate any targets with 1% error rate, Success defined as at least 80% of patients who receive the AR game being able to initiate the game and activate any targets with 1% error rate, The patient's postoperative inpatient hospital stay, average 7 days
Inpatient opioid use, The average daily inpatient MEDD (morphine equivalent dose) will be calculated from the electronic medical record as previously used in pediatric cancer surgical patients by the investigator, The patient's postoperative inpatient hospital stay, average 7 days|Outpatient opioid use, We will record whether the patient has any active opioid prescription 90-days (±10 Days) after surgery. This data will be confirmed by direct contact to patients' caregivers or via pharmacy registries on filled prescriptions., The patient's postoperative inpatient hospital stay, average 7 days|Average daily inpatient pain score, Age-appropriate pain-intensity scores will be determined using Visual and Colored Analogue Scales (VAS). This is a 10-point colored scaled validated for measuring pain intensity in pediatric populations and will be assessed twice daily at 9AM and 5PM., The patient's postoperative inpatient hospital stay, average 7 days|Number of opioid requests (rescue analgesia), We will record the total number of times opioids were required by patients to nurses and the patient-controlled analgesia infusion pumps during the inpatient period as recorded in the electronic medical record., The patient's postoperative inpatient hospital stay, average 7 days|Quality of life assessment, Age-appropriate Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) paper surveys will be administered to the patient (self-report) or guardian (proxy) when patients reach discharge-ready status., The patient's postoperative inpatient hospital stay, average 7 days|Ambulation/ "out of bed" movement, Distance (meters) achieved "out of bed" (ambulatory or non-ambulatory/wheelchair) during their inpatient stay while interacting with the app will be calculated by hand, based on how many times patient activated specific targets., The patient's postoperative inpatient hospital stay, average 7 days|Discharge-ready status, The number of days to discharge-ready status will be determined by the study physicians. This status will be assessed twice daily at 9AM and 5PM., The patient's postoperative inpatient hospital stay, average 7 days|Patient experience, In the patients who receive the AR game, responses to an electronic survey on the patient's experience designed by the MDACC Child Life team will be recorded when patients reach discharge-ready status., The patient's postoperative inpatient hospital stay, average 7 days|Outpatient pain scores, We will record average pain intensity experience by the patient during the 90-day (±10 Days) post surgery period. This data will be confirmed by direct contact to patient's guardian or as recorded in the electronic medical record during the patient's follow-up clinic visit, 90 days after the patient is discharged from the hospital|Outpatient quality of life, Age-appropriate Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) surveys will be administered to the patient (self-report) or guardian (proxy) by phone., 90 days after the patient is discharged from the hospital
Adverse events, Any adverse events clinically determined to be related to the use of AR (i.e., falls) will be recorded, Through study completion, average 4-month time period
