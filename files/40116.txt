Application and Clinical Effectiveness of Pelvic Reconstruction in Robot-assisted Radical Cystectomy-orthotopic Ileal Neobladder in the Male
To study the effect of pelvic reconstruction on early return of continence after robot-assisted radical cystectomy-orthotopic ileal neobladder in the male.
Bladder Cancer
PROCEDURE: pelvic reconstruction
day-time and night-time continence rate, Patients were considered continent when they required 0 or 1 safety pad during the day or at night., 6 months
perioperative complication rate, 3 months|operative time, 24 hours|estimated blood loss, 24 hours|overall survival, 1 year|recurrence-free survival, 1 year
This study will enroll male patients with bladder cancer who will undergo robot-assisted radical cystectomy-orthotopic ileal neobladder. The patients will be distributed into two comparable groups according to whether received pelvic reconstruction or not. Patient demographics and pathologic, perioperative, functional, and oncologic outcomes will be compared between the two groups.
