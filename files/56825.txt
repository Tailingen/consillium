A Study of LM-168 as a Single Agent or in Combination With Toripalimab in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumours
For phase I ,this study is to assess the safety and tolerability, obtain the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and/or Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) for LM-168 as a single agent or in combination with toripalimab in subjects with advanced solid tumours.

For phase II ,this study is to assess the preliminary anti-tumour activity of LM-168 as a single agent or in combination with toripalimab measured by objective response rate (ORR) in subjects with advanced solid tumours.
