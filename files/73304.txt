Evaluating the Implementation of a Comprehensive Multilevel Virtual Oncology Program Among Veterans Diagnosed With Lung, Colorectal, Prostate, and Breast Cancers in the US Department of Veterans Affairs
The purpose this pragmatic trial to test the effectiveness of an existing, ongoing clinical service, the VA National TeleOncology program (NTO), a multilevel telehealth population health management program. The primary aims are to study the intervention and determine its effectiveness on telehealth engagement, clinical quality, and healthcare cost outcomes across levels of Social Determinants of TeleHealth (SDTH) with the goal of promoting health equity.

Number of raw telehealth visits, Telehealth utilization among Veterans with cancer will be measured through raw telehealth visit counts., Post-NTO implementation (up to 3 months)|Fraction of patients engaging in at least one telehealth visit, Telehealth utilization among Veterans with cancer will be measured by fraction of patients engaging in at least one telehealth visit., Post-NTO implementation (up to 3 months)
Change in provider level Quality Oncology Practice Initiative (QOPI) score, The quality of care of the intervention will be evaluating utilizing the American Society of Clinical Oncology Practice Initiative (QOPI) performance measures. The scale consists of 26 performance measures assessed at the patient, provider, and facility levels. Each cancer care provider will have his or her patient QOPI measures aggregated together for a provider level QOPI score. Our primary interest is the difference in QOPI score by intervention condition, as estimated by the fixed-effect coefficient for the intervention indicator variable. Scores of 75% or more indicate the standard is met, scores less than 75% indicate the standards have not been met. An increase in the QOPI score indicates improvement., Pre-implementation, post-NTO implementation (up to 3 months)|Time of consultation to time of first appointment, Time to care will be measured through time of consultation to time of first appointment., Pre-implementation, post-NTO implementation (up to 3 months)|Time of consultation to time of first treatment, Time to care will be measured through time of consultation to time of first treatment., Pre-implementation, post-NTO implementation (up to 3 months)|Average total cost for cancer diagnosis, treatment and downstream HealthCare utilization, Post-NTO implementation (up to 3 months)
Study staff will use the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA), the VA health information technology system, to identify eligible patients at VA sites based on listed inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patient records will be observed of Veterans with a new cancer diagnosis of the lung, prostate, breast, or colon and a telehealth visit utilizing the VA National TeleOncology Service (NTO).
