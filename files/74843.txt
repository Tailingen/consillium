Phase 1/2 Study of ABI-009 in Nonmuscle Invasive Bladder Cancer
Purpose of this study is to determine appropriate dosing of ABI-009 and evaluate the safety and anti-tumor activity of ABI-009 in treatment of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer
Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC)
DRUG: ABI-009|DRUG: Gemcitabine
Phase 1: Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT) Following Intravesical Administration of ABI-009, The primary endpoint of the Phase 1 study is DLT following intravesical administration of ABI-009 in patients with BCG refractory or recurrent nonmuscle-invasive transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder to identify maximum deliverable dose (MDD). Systemic DLT will be defined as any grade systemic toxicity using the NCI CTCAE version 4.0. Local dose limiting toxicity was defined as grade 3 or 4 bladder toxicity (hematuria, dysuria, urinary retention, urinary frequency/urgency, or bladder spasms) using the NCI CTCAE version 4.0., Duration of treatment (6 weeks) plus 30 days follow up (up to 2.5 months)|Phase 2: Number of Participants Achieving a Complete Response Following Intravesical Administration of ABI-009 and Gemcitabine, The primary objective of the Phase 2 study is to evaluate the utility (potential for clinical efficacy) of ABI-009 in combination with gemcitabine in the treatment of BCG refractory or recurrent nonmuscle-invasive TCC of the bladder. Response rate will be measured and documented at the 6-week post-treatment assessment, including cystoscopy with biopsy. A complete response is defined as a cancer-negative biopsy at the 6-week post-treatment cystoscopy. No response will be defined as positive cystoscopic biopsy., End of Study [EOS, 3 months]
