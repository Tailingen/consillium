Study to Determine Treatment Effects of Denosumab in Patients With Breast Cancer Receiving Aromatase Inhibitor Therapy
The purpose of this study is to determine whether denosumab compared to placebo, will reduce the rate of first clinical fracture in women with non-metastatic breast cancer receiving (non-steroidal) aromatase inhibitor therapy.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Placebo|BIOLOGICAL: Denosumab|DRUG: Non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor therapy|DRUG: Zoledronic Acid|OTHER: Standard of Care
Time to First Clinical Fracture, The time to first on-study clinical fracture was defined as the number of days from randomization to the date of the x-ray confirming the clinical fracture. A clinical fracture is any clinically evident fracture with associated symptoms and confirmed by x-ray. Participants who died or withdrew without experiencing a clinical fracture were censored at the date of last contact or study termination whichever was earlier., From randomization until the primary analysis cut-off date of 26 March 2014; maximum time on main study at the cut-off was 87 months
Percent Change From Baseline in Total Lumbar Spine Bone Mineral Density (BMD) at Month 36 at Pre-selected Sites, Bone mineral density was assessed by dual x-ray absorptiometry., Baseline and Month 36|Percent Change From Baseline in Total Hip BMD at Month 36 at Pre-selected Sites, Bone mineral density was assessed by dual x-ray absorptiometry., Baseline and Month 36|Percent Change From Baseline in Femoral Neck BMD at Month 36 at Pre-selected Sites, Bone mineral density was assessed by dual x-ray absorptiometry., Baseline and Month 36|Number of Participants With New Vertebral Fractures, Assessment of vertebral fractures was performed by an expert radiologist at the central imaging center using a semiquantitative grading scale: Grade 1, 20% to 25% reduction in vertebral height (anterior, middle, or posterior); Grade 2, 25% to 40% reduction in height; Grade 3, greater than 40% reduction in height.

A new vertebral fracture was defined as a fracture in a previously undeformed vertebrae including new compression fractures, defined as those compression fractures having a decrease in total anterior or posterior height of at least 25% from baseline. New vertebral fractures includes morphometric vertebral fractures identified from on study x-rays and clinical vertebral fractures confirmed by x-rays., 36 months|Number of Participants With New or Worsening Vertebral Fractures, Assessment of vertebral fractures was performed by an expert radiologist at the central imaging center using a semiquantitative grading scale: Grade 1, 20% to 25% reduction in vertebral height (anterior, middle, or posterior); Grade 2, 25% to 40% reduction in height; Grade 3, greater than 40% reduction in height.

A new vertebral fracture was defined as a fracture in a previously undeformed vertebrae including new compression fractures, defined as those compression fractures having a decrease in total anterior or posterior height of at least 25% from baseline. New vertebral fractures includes morphometric vertebral fractures identified from on study x-rays and clinical vertebral fractures confirmed by x-rays. Worsening of pre-existing fractures was defined as an increase in fracture severity of at least 1 grade on the semiquantitative scale., 36 months|Disease-free Survival (DFS), DFS was defined as the time interval from the randomization date to the date of first evidence of local or distant metastases, contra-lateral breast cancer, secondary carcinoma, or death from any cause (whichever occurred first). Participants last known to be alive, who did not experience recurrence of disease, were censored at their last contact date or at the data cut-off date whichever came first., From randomization until the DFS data cut-off date of 15 September 2015; maximum time on main study at the cut-off was 102 months|Bone Metastases-free Survival (BMFS), BMFS was defined as the time interval from randomization to first occurrence of bone metastasis or death from any cause, whichever comes first. Participants last known to be alive, who did not experience bone metastasis, were censored at their last assessment (i.e., bone scan) date or at the last contact date, whichever comes first., From randomization until end of main study, maximum time on main study was 152 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause., Randomization until end of main study, maximum duration of main study was 152 months
Participants will remain on treatment until the required number of events (where an event is defined as first clinical fracture) is reached and all participants have had the opportunity to receive a minimum of at least 2 doses of study drug, whichever occurs later. The primary analysis data cut-off date (PADCD) is defined as the time at which the required number of events is reached and all participants have had the opportunity to receive at least 2 doses of study drug. When the PADCD is reached, all participants will discontinue study drug.

Following the study PADCD, participants will be followed every 12 months starting from their last study visit until a maximum of 66 months after PADCD.

After approval of Amendment 4, willing and eligible participants randomized to placebo during the double-blind phase may participate in an open-label phase (OLP) and receive denosumab 60 mg Q6M for up to 36 months (maximum of 7 doses).

After approval of Amendment 6 in 2019 a zoledronic acid (ZA) substudy was added to the protocol. Willing and eligible participants who participated in the OLP of the study and completed open-label denosumab may opt in to this ZA substudy and either receive a single dose of ZA (Therapy Arm), or be managed according to the current standard of care for this patient population (Control Arm).
