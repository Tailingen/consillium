NGS Screening Protocol to Detect Mutation of KEAP1 or NRF2/NFE2L2 Genes for the KEAPSAKE (CX-839-014) Trial
This is a multicenter screening protocol designed to identify patients with NSCLC who have tumor mutations in the KEAP1 or NRF2/NFE2L2 genes in order to determine potential eligibility for a biomarker selected clinical trial (CX-839-014, otherwise known as the KEAPSAKE trial). Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) present in blood samples collected from eligible patients will be analyzed by next generation sequencing (NGS) for selected biomarkers. A commercial liquid biopsy NGS test will be provided to study participants free of charge.
