Estimation of Tumor Response With Linac MRI-guided Adaptive Radiotherapy for Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer
The management of locally advanced cervical cancer (Figo \>IB) is based on radiochemotherapy (RCT) followed by brachytherapy. At present there is no personalized treatment, all patients undergoing radiochemotherapy will follow a conventional treatment by external radiotherapy (46 Gy in 23 sessions associated with cisplatin (CDDP) weekly) and brachytherapy to achieve a total equivalent biological dose around 80-90 Gy).The efficacy of this treatment has been proven for most patients, almost 80% being in complete response after RCT. Nevertheless, on an individual scale, there remains a significant variation in the tumor response, with patients who respond from the first week of treatment, "early responders" or, on the contrary, others who present significant tumor residues after external beam radiotherapy.Various macroscopic tumor volume (GTV) response patterns have been identified based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at diagnosis and MRI before brachytherapy, implying very different clinical target volumes for brachytherapy technique. The difference in tumor volume response has been identified as having a major impact on treatment response.

This is the first study attempting to evaluate tumor response in real time during radiochemotherapy treatment. Knowing the tumor response during treatment will make it possible to modify the management of locally advanced cervical cancer, several therapeutic options might then be discussed depending on the early response to treatment: dose de-escalation for early responders, reduction of time total treatment, personalization of brachytherapy management (technique and dose).

This observational study will allow rapid identification of responder and non-responder patients and might be used as a basis for personalized treatment strategies
Locally Advanced Cancer
DEVICE: MRI Linac
Recist criteria, The local response will be defined by the Recist 1.1 criteria on MRI. The response will be binary, i.e. complete response versus the 3 other categories of the Recist 1.1 classification that is to say partial response, stabilization or progression.

Nevertheless will identified 3 favorable situation:

1. complete response on MRI and PET scan
2. partial response but surgery no performed
3. partial response, surgery performed and no disease identified on the anatomopathology results, 8-10 weeks after the end of the treatment
