The EXPLORE MG Registry for Myasthenia Gravis
The purpose of this study is to create a Yale University Department of Neurology Myasthenia Gravis (MG) registry that will be used for current and future research projects involving the study of Myasthenia Gravis.
Myasthenia Gravis
OTHER: Blood Sample Draw
The number of successful blood draws will be reported at the conclusion of the sample collection, Successful Collection of Blood, 8 years
The number of stool samples collected will be reported at the conclusion of the sample, Count of Stool Samples, 8 years
This registry will allow for the research of several mechanisms of Myasthenia Gravis (MG) by studying peripheral blood, stool, disease status and course, and treatment of subjects with MG. The EXPLORE-MG Registry focuses on varied aspects of MG such as disease management, health care utilization, health costs, disease characteristics, and diagnostic tools. As such, it will aid in a broader understanding of MG, while providing a registry from which questions about the disease may be better answered.
