Ablative Chemoembolization for Unresectable and Large Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The objective of this study is to study the safety and tumor response of ACE for large HCC.
Carcinoma, Hepatocellular
PROCEDURE: Ablative chemoembolization (ACE)
Time to progression, the interval between the first treatment date and the date of radiological progression, including intralesional progression, extralesional progression, or extra-hepatic progression, 3 to 6 months after treatment
Tumor response, Tumor response at 3 month and 6 month from the date of first treatment as evaluated by triphasic contrast enhanced CT according to the EASL criteria, 3 to 6 months after treatment
Transarterial treatment has been playing an important role in the treatment algorithm for patients with multifocal or large intrahepatic hepatocellular carcinoma not eligible for surgical resection, transplantation, or local ablative therapy. Among the patient group with intermediate tumor stage, in which the tumor dimension exceeds 10cm, the treatment outcome of conventional chemoembolization (cTACE), chemoembolization using drug eluting beads (DEB-TACE) and radioembolization using yttrium 90 is generally unsatisfactory. Some would consider HCC of size \>10cm a relative contraindication for cTACE because of the poor treatment outcome. However, there is no better alternative treatment for local control of these tumors. Ablative chemoembolization (ACE) using Lipiodol-ethanol and anhydrous cisplatin has been found to be highly effective for local control of HCC as compared to cTACE in a case-control study. It is hypothesized that ACE is safe and effective for local control of large HCC of size \>10cm.
