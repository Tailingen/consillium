Radiotherapy in Primary Mediastinal Lymphoma
The use of Rituximab has been proposed to be useful and avoid the use of radiotherapy in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with bulky disease.We assess efficacy of adjuvant radiotherapy in patients treated with R-CHOP
Adjuvant Radiotherapy on Complete Remission Patients
RADIATION: no drugs
measurement of progression free-survival and overall survival at > 5 years, Assess if the use of adjuvant radiotherapy improve outcome in patients with primary mediastinal lymphoma treated initially with R-CHOP, 5 years
assess toxicity secondary to mediastinal radiotherapy, Assess if the addition of mediastinal radiotherapy to patients who received anthracyclines can produce an increase in cardiac toxicity, > 5 years
