Study of Adagloxad Simolenin (OBI-822)/OBI-821 in the Adjuvant Treatment of Patients With Globo H Positive TNBC
The GLORIA study is a Phase III, randomized, open-label study to prospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of adagloxad simolenin (OBI 822)/OBI-821 in the adjuvant treatment of patients with high risk, early stage Globo-H Positive TNBC.
Triple Negative Breast Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: adagloxad simolenin combined with OBI-821|DEVICE: Globo H IHC Assay|OTHER: Standard of care treatment
Measuring the effect of adagloxad simolenin (OBI-822)/OBI-821 treatment on improving invasive disease free survival (IDFS) in the study population., The outcome measure of the study is IDFS, defined by the STEEP system as the first occurrence of the time from the date of randomization to the date of first invasive disease recurrence (local, regional or distant), the date of secondary primary invasive cancer (breast or not), or the date of death from any cause., 5 years
Measuring the impact of adagloxad simolenin (OBI-822)/OBI-821 treatment in the study population on Overall Survival (OS)., OS is defined as the time from randomization to date of death from any cause, 7 years|Measuring the impact of adagloxad simolenin (OBI-822)/OBI-821 treatment in the study population on Quality of Life (QoL)., QoL defined as time to definitive deterioration in Health-related Quality of Life (HRQOL) using the global health status/QoL scale from European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) and the European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions 5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L). QoL baseline established at randomization.

Definitive deterioration defined as a 5% worsening relative to baseline in the HRQOL scale score from EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaires with no subsequent improvement above threshold, scored with the EORTC QLQ-C30 v3.0 Scoring Manual. The EQ-5D-5L questionnaire assesses mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression, rated by the patient. It is a standardized measure of health status to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal. 28 questions have a 4 point scale: not at all(1) to very much(4). 2 questions have a 7-point scale: very poor (1) to excellent(7)., 7 years|Measuring the impact of adagloxad simolenin (OBI-822)/OBI-821 treatment in the study population on Breast cancer-free interval (BCFI)., BCFI is defined by the STEEP system as the first occurrence of the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first invasive disease recurrence (local, regional or distant), the date of ductal carcinoma in situ (ipsilateral or contralateral), or the date of death from breast cancer, 7 years|Measuring the impact of adagloxad simolenin (OBI-822)/OBI-821 treatment in the study population on Distant disease-free survival (DDFS)., DDFS is defined by the STEEP system as the first occurrence of the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first distant disease recurrence, the date of the second primary invasive cancer (non-breast), or the date of death from any cause, 7 years|Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) [Time Frame: AEs will be noted as it occurs, with a timeframe from beginning of randomization to 4 weeks after last dose of study treatment.], Adverse Events will be graded and recorded by investigators per National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (NCI-CTCAE v5.0)., 2 years
