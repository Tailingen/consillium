Autologuos Lymphoid Effector Cells Specific Against Tumour (ALECSAT) as Add on to Standard of Care in Patients With Glioblastoma
This is a randomised, open-label, multi-centre, Phase II study in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.

62 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma are enrolled in the study in a 1:2 allocation (standard of care (SOC): ALECSAT as an adjunct therapy to SOC).

Patients recruited into this study will receive either:

* ALECSAT as an adjunct therapy to standard of care for newly diagnosed glioblastoma (first line therapy: Stupp regimen, followed by second line therapy at the Investigator's discretion) or
* Standard of care therapy for newly diagnosed glioblastoma (first line therapy: Stupp regimen, followed by second line therapy at the Investigator's discretion).

Progression Free Survival, Compare the progression free survival between patients who receive ALECSAT as add on to SoC and patients who only receive SoC, 24 months after LPFV or when 47 patients has reached investigator assessed disease progression or death from any cause
Proportion of patients alive at 12 and 24 months, To compare OS rate at 12 and 24 months between patients who receive ALECSAT as add on to SoC and patients who only receive SoC, 24 months after LPFV or when 47 patients has reached investigator assessed disease progression or death from any cause|Frequency and Severity of treatment related Adverse Events, Comparison of frequency and severity of treatment related AEs in the 2 study groups, Up to 24 months after randomisation of last patient
