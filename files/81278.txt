A Pilot Study for the Treatment of Patients With Metastatic and High Risk Sarcomas and Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumors
This protocol is designed to test the feasibility of the administration of vincristine, adriamycin and cytoxan, alternating with the newly developed regimen ifosfamide VP-16 as well as the efficacy of this therapy in addition to radiotherapy in producing complete responses and disease-free survival in patients with Ewing's sarcoma, primitive sarcoma of bone, peripheral neuroepithelioma, and soft tissue sarcoma. This will not be a randomized study but will be comparable to the large data base of similar patients treated on successive Pediatric Branch studies.
