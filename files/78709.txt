The purpose of the study is to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics,immunogenicity and efficacy of QLS31903 alone in the treatment of advanced cancer.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: QLS31903
Maximum tolerated dose（MTD）for Phase 1a, The MTD is determined by the number of the participants in cohort who suffer a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). The MTD is defined as the former dose at which more than one third of the participants develop a DLT. If no DLTs are observed, the MTD is not reached., 21days or 14 days after the first target dose(whichever is longer）|Recommended phase 2 dose(RP2D) for Phase 1a, The RP2D is defined as the dose level chosen by Safety Monitoring Committee(SMC), Duration of study, approximately 24 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR) for phase 1b, ORR is the percentage of patients with best response of CR and PR, From fist administration of QLS31903 to disease progression，death，loss to follow up,withdrawal of consent,initiation of a new anticancer therapy,study completion/closure,whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months
