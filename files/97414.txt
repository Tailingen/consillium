The Usefulness of Endoscopic Ultrasound-guided Biliary Drainage With a Newly Designed Hybrid Metallic Stent
The purpose of this study is to investigate the feasibility and safety of endoscopic ultrasound-guided biliary drainage with a newly designed hybrid metallic stent.
Bile Duct Obstruction|Disorder of Bile Duct Stent|Neoplasms
DEVICE: EUS-guided biliary drainage with a hybrid metallic stent
The stent patency rate, Up to 48 weeks
Patients' survival rate, Up to 48 weeks|Complication rate related to the hybrid stents, Up to 48 weeks
Endoscopic ultrasound-guided biliary drainage with a fully covered metallic stent was a safe and effective method in patients with malignant biliary obstructions and had a comparatively long patency duration. Nevertheless, the significant rate of distal stent migration cannot be ignored, suggesting the need for a newly designed metallic stent for endoscopic ultrasound-guided biliary drainage.
