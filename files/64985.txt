Proton Radiotherapy for Stage I, IIA, and IIB Seminoma
Phase II study using Proton radiation therapy to treat males, aged 18 years or older, with Stage I, IIA and IIB Seminoma. This research study will be done in conjunction with the Robert H. Burr Proton Therapy Center at the Mass. General Hospital and the Department of Defense. In the feasibility portion of the study patients will be evaluated to determine acute toxicity. If the study is deemed feasible the principal investigator (PI) hopes that proton RT will reduce the lethargy rate as compared to photon radiation therapy (RT).
Stage I, IIA and IIB Seminoma
RADIATION: Proton Radiation Therapy
Number of Serious Adverse Events, 5 years
This is a Phase II study using proton radiation therapy in addition to their standard care in subjects who have Stage I, IIA, IIB Seminoma. Testicular cancer are the most common solid cancers among men aged 20 to 35. Each subject must be 18 years of age or older and have a histologically proven diagnosis of testicular cancer. In addition to a subject's routine exams and tests, they will be asked to complete a series of quality of life questionnaires before, during and after their treatment. All side effects/toxicities will be monitored and recorded. Patients will be followed for a minimum of 5 years.
