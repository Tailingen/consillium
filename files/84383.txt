A Study of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in Combination With Etoposide/Platinum (Cisplatin or Carboplatin) for Participants With Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer (MK-3475-604/KEYNOTE-604)
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab plus standard of care (SOC) chemotherapy (etoposide/platinum \[EP\]) in participants with newly diagnosed extensive stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) who have not previously received systemic therapy for this malignancy.

The primary study hypotheses are that pembrolizumab+EP prolongs Progression-free Survival (PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 by blinded independent central review (BICR) and Overall Survival (OS) compared with placebo+EP in adult participants with ES-SCLC. In this study, RECIST 1.1 has been modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ.

With protocol Amendment 07 (03-Oct-2018), the outcome measure of "Change from Baseline at Weeks 12 and 24 in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30) Global Health Status/Quality of Life Scale" was replaced with a single time point analysis at Week 18.
Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC)
BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Normal saline solution|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Etoposide
Progression-free Survival (PFS) Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. PD, as determined by RECIST 1.1, was defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered PD. For this study, RECIST 1.1 was modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. The PFS was calculated using the non-parametric Kaplan-Meier method for censored data and presented for the first course of study treatment per protocol., Up to approximately 30.5 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. Participants without documented death at the time of the analysis were censored at the date of the last follow up. The OS was calculated using the non-parametric Kaplan-Meier method for censored data and presented for the first course of study treatment per protocol., Up to approximately 30.5 months
Objective Response Rate (ORR) Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who achieve a best objective response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST 1.1. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. PR was defined as ≥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum diameters. In this study, RECIST 1.1 was modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. The ORR was calculated using the Miettinen \& Nurminen method stratified by type of platinum therapy (carboplatin or cisplatin), baseline ECOG performance status (0 or 1), and baseline LDH (≤ or \> upper limit of normal) and presented for the first course of study treatment per protocol., Up to approximately 30.5 months|Duration of Response (DOR) Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), DOR was defined as the time from first documented evidence of a Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) per RECIST 1.1 until progressive disease (PD) per RECIST 1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. PR was defined as ≥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum diameters. PD was defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of ≥1 new lesions was also considered PD. In this study, RECIST 1.1 was modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. The DOR was calculated using the product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) method for censored data and is presented for the first course of study treatment per protocol., Up to approximately 30.5 months|Number of Participants Who Experienced an Adverse Event (AE), An adverse event was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which did not necessarily have to have had a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event could therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that was temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, was also an adverse event. The number of participants who experienced an AE was reported for each arm according to the treatment received and is presented for the first course of study treatment per protocol., Up to approximately 30.5 months|Number of Participants Discontinuing Study Treatment Due to an Adverse Event (AE), An adverse event was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which did not necessarily have to have had a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event could therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that was temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, was also an adverse event. The number of participants who discontinued due to an AE was reported for each arm according to the treatment received and is presented for the first course of study treatment per protocol., Up to approximately 26 months|Number of Participants Experiencing Any Grade 3 to 5 Adverse Events (AE) as Assessed by National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.03 (CTCAE 4.03), The CTCAE uses Grades 1 through 5 correlating to AE severity criteria. Grade 1=mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated. Grade 2=moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL). Grade 3=severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-care ADL. Grade 4=life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. Grade 5=death related to AE. The number of participants who experienced any Grade 3 to 5 AE was reported for each arm according to the treatment received and is presented for the first course of study treatment per protocol., Up to approximately 30.5 months|Change From Baseline at Week 18 in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30) Global Health Status/Quality of Life Scale, EORTC QLQ-C30 is a questionnaire that rates the overall quality of life in cancer participants. The first 28 questions use a 4-point scale (1=not at all to 4=very much) for evaluating function (physical, role, social, cognitive, emotional), symptoms (diarrhea, fatigue, dyspnea, appetite loss, insomnia, nausea/vomiting, constipation, and pain) and financial difficulties. The last 2 questions use a 7-point scale (1=very poor to 7=excellent) to evaluate overall health and quality of life. Scores are transformed to a range of 0 to 100 using a standard EORTC algorithm. Change from baseline scores were calculated using a constrained longitudinal data analysis (cLDA) model. Negative change from baseline values indicated deterioration in health status or functioning and positive changes indicated improvement. Data are presented for the first course of study treatment per protocol., Baseline (prior to first dose of study treatment in Cycle 1 [cycle length = 21 days]) and Week 18|Change From Baseline at Week 12 in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30) Global Health Status/Quality of Life Scale, EORTC QLQ-C30 is a questionnaire that rates the overall quality of life in cancer participants.
