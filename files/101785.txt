Beta Alethine in Treating Patients With Low-Grade Lymphoma
RATIONALE: Biological therapies such as beta alethine use different ways to stimulate the immune system and stop cancer cells from growing.

PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of beta alethine in treating patients who have low-grade lymphoma.
Lymphoma
DRUG: beta alethine
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the antitumor effects of low-dose beta-alethine in patients with low grade B-cell lymphoma.
* Assess the effects of this regimen on delayed-type hypersensitivity in these patients.
* Assess the safety of this regimen in this patient population.

OUTLINE: This is an multicenter study.

Patients receive low-dose beta-alethine subcutaneously once every 2 weeks for a total of 6 doses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients with no evidence of tumor progression may receive additional courses of therapy.

Patients are followed for 2 weeks from the last dose or for a minimum of 30 days if they withdraw due to an adverse event.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 13-37 patients will be accrued for this study.
