Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK)-Positive Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Post-alectinib Treatment Patterns
This study aims to understand patient profiles, treatment patterns, and clinical outcomes among ALK-positive NSCLC patients treated with alectinib, and post-alectinib treatment patterns and outcomes.
Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma
DRUG: Alectinib
Number of Participants Classified According to Treatments Received for Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase Positive-non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (ALK + NSCLC) in Sequence, Number of participants classified according to ALK-TKI treatment patterns or sequencing were reported in this outcome measure., During the inclusion period from 01-Jun-2017 to 31-Aug-2020 (maximum up to 39 months); eligible data was studied during approximately 31 months of this retrospective study|Number of Participants Classified According to Reason for Alectinib Treatment Discontinuation, Number of participants classified according to reason for Alectinib treatment discontinuation were reported in this outcome measure. One participant could have more than one reason for discontinuation., From initiation of index treatment to discontinuation from 01-Jun-2017 to 31-Aug-2021 (maximum up to 51 months); eligible data was studied during approximately 31 months of this retrospective study|Duration of Therapy (DOT), DOT was defined as duration of time between alectinib or post-alectinib treatment initiation and discontinuation as documented in the iKM EHR database. Participants who did not have evidence of discontinuation, starting new therapy, or whose last prescription date was less than (\<) 30 days from the end of the study period, were censored at last visit date or end of study period., Alectinib or post-alectinib treatment initiation till its discontinuation or censoring date, during study observation period (maximum up to 51 months); eligible data was studied during approximately 31 months of this retrospective study|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the interval between treatment and the date of death (any cause) as documented in the iKM EHR database. Participants who did not die within the study observation period were censored on the study end date or the last visit date available in the dataset, whichever occurred first., From start of treatment until date of death or censoring date, during study observation period (maximum up to 51 months); eligible data was studied during approximately 31 months of this retrospective study|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS was measured from the initiation of the treatment to the date of progression (documented by provider as disease has progressed or worsening of disease) or date of death due to any cause, censoring participants who were still alive at the end of the study observation period and did not progress at the last visit date., From initiation of index treatment to date of progression or death due to any cause or censoring date, during study observation period (maximum up to 51 months); eligible data was studied during approximately 31 months of this retrospective study
