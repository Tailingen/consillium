DYNAmic Immune Microenvironment of HCC Treated With atezolIzumab Plus bevaCizumab
Part I (Clinical trial setting): A single-arm phase II study to investigate the efficacy of neoadjuvant atezolizumab (T) + bevacizumab (A) in patients with potentially resectable BCLC stage B/C or high risk resectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (n = 45)

Part II (Biomarker study setting): Exploratory translational research will be conducted using samples obtained from Part 1 (n =45) and those acquired from an independent cohort of treatment-naïve HCC patients (n = 15).
