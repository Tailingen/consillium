Pilot Study of App-delivered Sleep Coaching Among Cancer Survivors and Their Partners
The proposed study will test the feasibility and acceptability of enrolling and retaining cancer survivors and their bedroom partners in a study evaluating digitally delivered behavioral sleep interventions.
Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Sleep coaching|BEHAVIORAL: Sleep education
Satisfaction assessed by study-specific survey after the intervention - acceptability, The intervention/study will be deemed acceptable if, on average, participants report satisfaction with the overall program/study as â‰¥2 on a 0-4 scale., 8 weeks - Immediately after the intervention|Feasibility assessed by recruitment and retention rates, The intervention/study will be deemed feasible if 50% of eligible potential participants enroll and 75% of enrolled participants are retained at post-intervention, Throughout the recruitment period
Change in sleep health from baseline to immediately after the intervention, Participants will complete 8-item short forms of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) sleep disturbance and sleep-related impairment measures at baseline and immediately after the intervention. Raw scores will be converted to T-scores with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Higher scores on PROMIS measures indicate more of the underlying construct., 8 weeks - Immediately after the intervention|Change in insomnia symptoms from baseline to immediately after the intervention, Participants will complete 7-item Insomnia Severity Index at baseline and immediately after the intervention. Scores range from 0-28 with higher scores indicating more acute symptoms of insomnia., 8 weeks - Immediately after the intervention|Change in symptom burden from baseline to immediately after the intervention, Participants will complete PROMIS scales assessing fatigue, anxiety, and depression at baseline and immediately after the intervention. Raw scores will be converted to T-scores with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Higher scores on PROMIS measures indicate more of the underlying construct., 8 weeks - Immediately after the intervention
Poor sleep is a common issue among cancer survivors that can persist for years and has been linked to increased symptoms (e.g., depression, fatigue), worse quality of life, and worse clinical outcomes like cancer progression and mortality. Partners of cancer survivors also experience poor sleep, but current interventions typically focus on survivors, leaving partners underrepresented. The proposed study will test the feasibility and acceptability of enrolling and retaining cancer survivors and their bedroom partners in a study evaluating digitally delivered behavioral sleep interventions.
