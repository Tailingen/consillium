Intersphincteric Resection With or Without Intraoperative Radiation in Rectal Cancer
The purpose of this study was to research on the safety and feasibility of ISR combined with low energy X ray intra-operative radiotherapy for the patients with local advanced rectal cancer.

Inter-sphincteric resection (ISR) has become an increasingly popular optional surgical tool for the treatment of very low rectal cancer. Nowadays, preoperative criteria for Lap ISR were the patients whose diagnosed with clinical stages T1-2 and N0_1, which only a few patients with early stages can benefit from it. However, intra-operative radiotherapy with low energy X ray applied by Intrabeam is becoming an accepted radiotherapy technique for treatment of cancers. The purpose of this study was to research on the safety and feasibility of ISR combined with low energy X ray intra-operative radiotherapy for the patients with local advanced rectal cancer.
