The objective of this study is to conduct the RN-CHeFRx (Real Nourishment and Cooking Healthy Food is Rx) for 12 weeks among Black women who are obese and hypertensive living Chicago. We propose to 1) Pilot the RN-CHEFRx intervention and measures that will be used to assess blood pressure, BMI status, and sodium intake with 20 Black women diagnosed with hypertension and BMI â‰¥ 30. We will assess the efficacy of the evaluation tools to be used in a future clinical trial at three-time points (baseline, 12 weeks, and 6 months); and 2) Assess the feasibility and acceptability of the RN-CHeFRx intervention using interviews, surveys, and documentary analysis. Findings from this study will inform a larger efficacy trial of RN-CHeFRx to improve dietary behaviors and blood pressure control among Black women with hypertension and obesity
