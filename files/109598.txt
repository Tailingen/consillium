Treatment Patterns and Real-World Clinical Outcomes in Patients With Advanced NSCLC and MET Exon 14 Skipping Mutation in the United States
This was a retrospective, noninterventional cohort study of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (aNSCLC) with MET exon 14 skipping mutation who received treatment with capmatinib, immunotherapy (IO), or chemotherapy (CT) in real-world practice settings. Data abstraction was performed by the participating physician.
