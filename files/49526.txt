Primary Chemotherapy in Patients With HER2-positive Early Breast Cancer
Open-label, multicenter phase I/II trial. Patients with HER2-positive (overexpressing or amplified), invasive breast cancer with T1c N1-2 or T2 N0-2 disease will be treated with

* Non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (NPLD; Myocet, 60 mg/m\^2 i.v. day 1 q3 weeks),
* Paclitaxel (175 mg/m\^2 i.v. day 1 q3 weeks), and
* Lapatinib (GW572016, Tykerb, 750-1500 mg/d orally daily until the day of the definitive surgery) Treatment is planned for 6 cycles unless there is evidence of unacceptable toxicity, disease progression or inadequate efficacy (defined as a decrease in tumor size \<25% after 4 courses measured by ultrasound or MR-mammography), or if the patient requested to be released.

Breast cancer is the most common malignancy affecting females in northern Europe and North America, corresponding to an age-corrected annual incidence of 100 to 120 per 100000 females. Approximately 30-40% of all patients treated with curative intent will develop metastatic disease. Perioperative systemic treatment has made a major impact on relapse-free and overall survival of women with early-stage breast cancer \[ , \] with therapeutic strategies being based on the endocrine responsiveness and the estimated risk of relapse defined by tumor size, axillary lymph node involvement, histologic and nuclear grade, lymphatic and/or vascular invasion, HER2/neu-overexpression and age \[ \]. Perioperative therapy has traditionally been administered postoperatively, but chemotherapy is increasingly utilized in the preoperative setting as it can significantly improve the rate of breast conserving surgery, and new regimens can be evaluated rapidly and more precisely.
