De-escalation Radiation Strategy After NAC in Combination With ICI in LAHNSCC
This study is a single-arm exploratory study conducted in LAHNSCC. Eligible patients received two cycles of pembrolizumab immunotherapy in combination with albumin-bound paclitaxel and cisplatin induction chemotherapy, followed by definitive concurrent radiochemotherapy. Three months after the completion of radiotherapy, a follow-up examination was conducted, and salvage surgery or systemic therapy was performed as necessary based on the follow-up results.
Locally Advanced Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: immunotherapy：pembrolizumab；chemo：albumin-bound paclitaxel and cisplatin
Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) (local-regional recurrence) is defined as the time from enrollment to the occurrence of local or regional lymph node recurrence or death for any reason., 1 year
Overall survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the time from enrollment to death for any reason, 3-year|Clinical response rate, Clinical response is defined as the radiological evaluation of tumor regression as partial remission (PR) and complete remission (CR) on imaging assessment three months after the completion of treatment., 6 months|Safety(Grade 3-5 AE), Safety is primarily assessed based on the probability of occurrence of Grade 3-5 adverse effects in different organs according to CTCAE 4.0 (including radiation-related injuries and adverse reactions to immunotherapy)., 1-year|Quality of life, The assessment of quality of life is conducted using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire - Head and Neck Module (EORTC QLQ-H\&N 35), which includes eight domains: pain, swallowing, senses, speech, social eating, social contact, sexuality and single items. Each item is scored on a scale from 0 to 100. A high score for a functional scale or global QOL implies a high level of functioning or global QOL, whereas a high score for a symptom scale or single item implies a high level of symptoms., 6 month and 1 year after the treatment
