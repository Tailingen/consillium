To explore the safety and clinical efficacy of cisplatin combined with RC48 and anti-PD-1 antibodies AK105 in Her-2 positive advanced gastric cancer.
Advanced Gastric Carcinoma|HER2-positive Gastric Cancer
DRUG: RC48+AK105+cisplatin
ORR, the proportion of patients who got CR and PR, three months
PFS, the duration of diseases stable or better, six months and twelve months|DCR, the proportion of patients who got CR, PR and SD, three months
Although anti-PD-1 antibody could prolong the survival of patients with adanced gastic cancer, there are relatively few reports on anti-PD-1 antibody therapy in Her2-positive gastric cancer. RC48 is a primary anti-HER2 antibody-drug conjugate, which has been approved by the Chinese NMPA for the later-line treatment of Her2-positive gastric cancer. This study was to explore the safety and clinical efficacy of RC48 combined with cisplatin and AK105 in previously untreated patients with HER2-positive gastric cancer.
