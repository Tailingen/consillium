Study to Determine the Effect of Food on the Blood Levels of AZD9291 Following Oral Dosing of a Tablet Formulation in Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a 2-part study in patients with epidermal growth factor receptor mutation positive (EGFRm+) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose disease has progressed on treatment with an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI): Part A will determine the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of AZD9291; Part B will allow patients further access to AZD9291 and will provide for additional safety data collection.

Part A is a randomised, open-label, 2 treatment period crossover study in which patients will each receive a single oral dose of AZD9291 (1 x 80 mg tablet) at breakfast time (approximately 0800) in each of 2 treatment periods (once immediately following a high fat meal \[fed\], and once in the fasted state \[fasted\]), with a washout period of 9 days between doses.

Approximately 38 patients are planned to be enrolled and dosed; at least 30 evaluable patients will be required to complete Part A (ie, the last PK sample in Treatment Period 2 \[TP 2\] has been collected). Additional patients may be enrolled to allow for at least 30 evaluable patients
