Hemi-Gland Cryoablation for Prostate Cancer at UCLA
This is a prospective data collection of men who are electing to undergo prostate hemi-gland cryoablation.

The purpose of this observational research study is to investigate the localized treatment of prostate cancer using hemi-gland cryoablation.

UCLA patients undergoing hemi-gland cryoablation are a unique cohort compared to prior research because all patients at UCLA have had a pre-treatment multi-parametric MRI and Ultrasound fusion targeted biopsy; they will be followed in a similar fashion. This results in more precise assessment of a target region of cancer for ablation which may, in turn, result in improved clinical outcomes.
Prostate Cancer|Prostate Adenocarcinoma|Prostate Disease
DEVICE: Hemigland Cryoablation
Clinical Response to Cancer Treatment, Our primary endpoint will be a patient's clinical response to cancer treatment, specifically, the degree of prostate cancer on a post-treatment fusion biopsy compared to pre-treatment., 6 months
Quality of Life Assessment - Urinary Function, Comparison of urinary function pre- and post-treatment will be obtained using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC-26) questionnaires to report combined overall urinary function assessments., 6 months
Quality of Life Assessment - Erectile Function, Comparison of erectile function pre- and post-treatment will be obtained using the 5-Item International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) Sexual Health Inventory for Men and the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC-26) questionnaires to report combined overall erectile function assessments., 6 months
