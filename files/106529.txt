Anti-PD-1 Antibody and Pegaspargase Combined With Radiotherapy in Early-Stage ENKTL
Aim of the trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sintilimab and pegaspargase in combination with pegaspargase for the initial treatment of previously untreated patients with limited stage NK/T cell lymphoma.All eligible patients will be treated with sintilimab combined with pegaspargase administered every 3 weeks for 4 cycles followed by standard radiotherapy with or without concurrent sintilimab and pegaspargase administered every 3 weeks. After radiotherapy, patients with complete remission with positive plasma EBV-DNA or partial response will continue with sintilimab maintenance up to 2 years.
Extranodal NK/T-cell Lymphoma, Nasal Type
DRUG: Pegaspargase|DRUG: Anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody|RADIATION: Definitive intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT)
progression free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival was defined as the time from the date of diagnosis until the date of the first documented day of disease progression or relapse, using 2014 Lugano criteria2016 Refinement of the Lugano Classification lymphoma response criteria in the era of immunomodulatory therapy, or death from any cause, whichever occurred first., Baseline up to data cut-off (up to approximately 4 years)
complete remission (CR) rate, Percentage of participants with complete response was determined on the basis of investigator assessments according to 2014 Lugano criteria and 2016 Refinement of the Lugano Classification lymphoma response criteria in the era of immunomodulatory therapy., At the end of Cycle 6 (each cycle is 21 days)|overall response rate (ORR), Percentage of participants with overall response was determined on the basis of investigator assessments according to 2014 Lugano criteria and 2016 Refinement of the Lugano Classification lymphoma response criteria in the era of immunomodulatory therapy., At the end of Cycle 6 (each cycle is 21 days)|overall survival (OS), Overall survival in the overall study population was defined as the time from the date of diagnosis to the date of death from any cause. Reported is the percentage of participants with event., Baseline up to data cut-off (up to approximately 4 years)|Duration of response, Time from first occurrence of documented CR or PR to disease progression/relapse, or death from any cause for participants with a response of CR or PR. Tumor assessments were performed with PET-CT., Baseline up to data cut-off (up to approximately 4 years)|EBV-DNA load change, EBV-DNA load at each cycle for comparison, At the end of Cycle 6 (each cycle is 21 days)|Number of Participants With Treatment-Related Adverse Events as Assessed by CTCAE v4.0, An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events., Baseline up to data cut-off (up to approximately 4 years)
This is a multicentre, open-label, single-arm, phase II clinical study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sintilimab and pegaspargase in combination with pegaspargase for the initial treatment of previously untreated patients with limited stage NK/T cell lymphoma.All eligible patients will be firstly treated with sintilimab combined with pegaspargase administered every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. If the patient achieves complete remission（CR）, standard radiotherapy will be performed, otherwise, they will receive concurrent chemoradiotherapy（CCRT）(radiation 50 Gy and two cycles of sintilimab and pegaspargase every 3 weeks). After radiotherapy or CCRT, patients achieving CR with positive plasma EBV-DNA or partial response will continue with sintilimab maintenance up to 2 years.
