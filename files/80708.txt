Phase I/IIa Study of Pharmacokinetics and Safety of Epidiferphane™ and Taxanes in Breast Cancer Patients
Patients with breast cancer are commonly treated with taxane chemotherapy. Some very common side effects of taxanes, such as anemia and peripheral neuropathy, are often as not well addressed during treatment, resulting in dose reductions, dose delays and early discontinuation (collectively called relative dose intensity) of these chemotherapy agents in 15-80 % of patients on these drugs. This reduction in relative dose intensity (RDI) results in worse clinical outcomes such as progression free and overall survival. Pre-clinical studies in mouse models subjected to standardized chemotherapy regimens containing paclitaxel or oxaliplatin have shown that the nutritional supplement Epidiferphane™ reduces both neuropathy and anemia. This study will investigate whether the use of Epidiferphane™ in patients with breast cancer receiving taxane chemotherapy results in an attenuation of the side effects experienced, as well as an improvement in tumor response rate. The safety and maximum tolerated dose of Epidiferphane™ in this patient population will also be determined in this study.

Cmax of Epidiferphane's components, The Cmax of each of Epidiferphane's components will be based on blood concentration measured prior to taxane chemotherapy administration, as well as at 1, 2 and 24 hours after taxane chemotherapy administration., 24 hours|Rate of occurrence of DLTs by dose level in patients with breast cancer who are being treated with taxanes, This will be assessed by the rate of occurrence of DLTs by Epidiferphane dose level, 4 months|Maximum tolerated dose of Epidiferphane in patients with breast cancer who are being treated with taxanes, 3 months|Cmax of taxanes, The Cmax of the taxane chemotherapy agents given will be based on blood concentrations measured prior to taxane chemotherapy administration, as well as at 1, 2 and 24 hours after taxane chemotherapy administration., 3 weeks|Number of adverse events (graded according to CTCAE v5.0 criteria) by epidiferphane dose level, 4 months|Concentration at 24 hours (C24 hours) of Epidiferphane's components, The C24 hours of each of Epidiferphane's components will be based on blood concentration measured 24 hours after taxane chemotherapy administration., 24 hours|Concentration at 24 hours (C24 hours) of taxanes, The C24 hours of the taxanes given will be based on blood concentration measured 24 hours after taxane chemotherapy administration., 24 hours
Change in CTCAE grade 2 or higher neuropathy and anemia, as compared to historically reported rates for the occurrence of each of these events, 4 months|Effect of Epidiferphane on tumor response rate, as measured by RECIST 1.1 criteria and pathologic tumor response at surgery, 3 months|Effect of Epidiferphane on the neuropathy marker NF-kB, as measured by multiplex cytokine bead analysis, 3 weeks|Effect of Epidiferphane on the neuropathy marker VEGFA, as measured by multiplex cytokine bead analysis, 3 weeks|Effect of Epidiferphane on the neuropathy marker Nrf2, as measured by multiplex cytokine bead analysis, 3 weeks|Effect of Epidiferphane on the neuropathy marker IL18, as measured by multiplex cytokine bead analysis, 3 weeks|Effect of Epidiferphane on quality of life, as measured by the EORTC QLQ-C30 scale, The EORTC QLQ-C30 measures ability to perform everyday activities and whether the subject has experienced select physical symptoms on a scale of 1-4 (with 1 meaning "Not at all" and 4 meaning "Very much"), as well as overall quality of life and overall healt over the past week on a scale from 1-7 (with 1 meaning "Very Poor" and 7 meaning "Excellent")., 3 months|Effect of Epidiferphane on quality of life, as measured by the FACT-Taxane scale, The FACT-Taxane measures various aspects of physical, social, emotional, and functional well-being, as well as whether the subject has experienced select physical symptoms over the past 7 days, on a scale of 0-4 (with 0 meaning "Not at all" and 4 meaning "Very much")., 3 months
