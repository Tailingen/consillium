Rectal Cancer
DRUG: Chemotherapy|RADIATION: Radiation Therapy
Three-year disease free survival (DFS), The three-year disease free survival (DFS) defined as the number of patients alive without recurrence of disease at 3 years measured from the date of clinical complete response (cCR) or date of total mesorectal excision (TME) at surgery (whichever is earlier)., 3 years after end of treatment
Pathologic complete response (pCR) rate, The number of patients that achieve pathologic complete response(pCR)(defined as negative surgical margins and no evidence of residual viable tumor) at time of total mesorectal excision (TME)., 3 Years after end of treatment|Clinical complete response (cCR) following total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) based on tumor response, Determine the cCR using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), in patients evaluable for response, 3 Years after end of treatment|The number of Adverse events (AEs) per participant, The number of Adverse events (AEs) per participant characterized and graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0 (NCI CTCAE v. 5.0), 39 Months|Progression (PFS) Rate, PFS defined as the time from initiation of chemotherapy until date of progression, 3 Years after end of treatment|Overall Survival (OS) Rate, OS defined as the time from initiation of chemotherapy until death by any cause., 3 Years after end of treatment|Number of patients who do not require an ostomy at time of surgery, After neoadjuvant therapy is complete patients will undergo assessment of disease status prior to determination of whether they will proceed to surgical resection or active surveillance, 116 Days
This trial involves 4 cycles of systemic chemotherapy followed by short-course RT with concurrent 5-FU neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and subsequent consolidation with 4 cycles of systemic chemotherapy prior to surgery or, for those who achieve cCR, the option of non-operative active surveillance.Three-year disease free survival (DFS) defined as the percentage of patients alive without recurrence of disease at 3 years measured from the date of clinical complete response (cCR) or date of total mesorectal excision (TME) at surgery (whichever is earlier).
