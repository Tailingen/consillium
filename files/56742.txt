A Study of CNCT19 Treatment in Children and Adolescent r/r ALL Patients(Pediatric)
This is a multi-center, phase Ib/II trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CNCT19 treatment in Children and Adolescent (pediatric) patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r B-cell ALL).
B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: single dose of CNCT19
Overall Remission Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as Complete Remission (CR) and Complete Remission with Incomplete Blood Count Recovery (CRi) per NCCN classification, as determined by Independent Review Committee (IRC), within 3 months

This trial is a multi-center, open label, single-arm, phase Ib/II trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CNCT19 in Children and Adolescent(aged 3\~18 years old) patients (pediatric) with r/r B-cell ALL.

The phase Ib part of the trial is to evaluate the safety, optimal dose of CNCT19, Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics(PK/PD)and preliminary efficacy in the treatment of Children and Adolescent patients with r/r B-cell ALL.

The phase II part of the trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CNCT19 in in the treatment of Children and Adolescent patients with r/r B-cell ALL.

The study includes screening, pre-treatment (Cell Product manufacture \& lymphodepletion), CNCT19 infusion , safety and efficacy follow-up, and survival follow-up. All subjects who have received CNCT19 infusion will be followed for up to 2 years.
