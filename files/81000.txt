Maintenance Therapy in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Patients
The purpose of this study is to determine if Revlimid will help maintain patients with acute myeloid leukemia in remission.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Revlimid
To assess the feasibility and assess the effect on relapse free survival by giving Revlimid in the post complete remission maintenance setting, The 1st interim analysis will be done once all subjects have completed 12 cycles, and the 2nd interim analysis will be done once all subjects have completed treatment.
To determine the toxicity of Revlimid when given in the maintenance setting., The 1st interim analysis will be done after all subjects have receieved 12 cycles and the 2nd when all subjects have completed treatment.
At present, the majority of AML patients \>60 years of age that achieve CR and thereafter successfully complete further chemotherapy, are not candidates for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (alloBMT) due to their age. Rather, this group of patients is simply observed until relapse occurs. In this age group, the median duration of CR is only \~10 months. The survival of patients \<60 years of age who are not candidates for transplantation (due to donor unavailability), and who are in CR2 or higher is also extremely poor. Several lines of evidence suggest that the immune system - and in particular AML specific CTLs and NK cells - is capable of recognizing and clearing AML cells.
