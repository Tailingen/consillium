Cytoreduction With or Without Intraoperative Intraperitoneal Hyperthermic Chemotherapy (HIPEC) in Patients With Peritoneal Carcinomatosis From Ovarian Cancer, Fallopian Tube or Primary Peritoneal Carcinoma
The purpose of this clinical trial is to Investigate whether the administration of HIPEC with Cisplatin (75 milligrams per square meter of body surface) after surgical cytoreduction in women with ovarian, tubal or primary peritoneal carcinoma increased disease-free survival period compared with patients without HIPEC treatment.
