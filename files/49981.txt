Helicobacter Pylori Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing of Korea
The purpose of this study is to make nationwide registry for antimicrobial resistance of Helicobacter pylori using single method with agar dilution in Korea.
Helicobacter Pylori Infection|Peptic Ulcer|Lymphoma|Gastric Cancer|Gastritis
OTHER: No intervention
The rate of exceeding the resistance criteria in Helicobacter pylori(H. pylori) antibiotic susceptibility test(Agar dilution method), The resistance criterion specifies that Clarithromycin is excess of 1.0 μg/mL, Amoxicillin is excess of 0.5 μg/mL, Metronidazole is excess of 8 μg/mL, Tetracycline is excess of 4 μg/mL, Levofloxacin is excess of 1 μg/mL and Ciprofloxacin is excess of 1 μg/mL.

All of resistance criteria follow a criteria of NCCLS(National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards), 6 more days
The gap of the rate of the antibiotic resistance to H. pylori by regional groups, 6 more days|The success rate of H. pylori strain separation, Analyze the case of inseparable H. pylori strain and the reason of failure for culture after H. pylori strain separation., 6 more days
Backgrounds:

The success rate of Helicobacter pylori eradication in Korea is not sufficient in recent days. The main cause of eradication failure is known as antimicrobial resistance and previous studies showed that resistant rates were different according to the regions in Korea. However, until now, there are not enough studies about the nationwide results for antimicrobial resistance and previous reports used various methods for the resistant test.

Theories and Plans:

The nationwide resistant registry of Helicobacter pylori using standardized single method, agar dilution test, can be useful for the development of new eradication methods to make eradication rate higher. Moreover, the higher rate of Helicobacter pylori eradication can reduce the chance of gastric cancer and also can reduce the medical expenses.
