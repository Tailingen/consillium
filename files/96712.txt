Efficacy and Safety of Simtuzumab in Adults With Primary, Post Polycythemia Vera or Post Essential Thrombocythemia Myelofibrosis
This study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of simtuzumab (GS-6624) on bone marrow fibrosis either alone or in combination with ruxolitinib in participants with primary myelofibrosis (PMF) and post polycythemia vera or post essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis (ET/PV MF).

The study is designed as a two-stage trial. In the stage 1, participants will be randomized into two cohorts to receive either 200 or 700 mg of study drug. In the stage 2, participants on ruxolitinib will be randomized to receive either 200 or 700 mg of study drug.
Myelofibrosis
DRUG: Simtuzumab|DRUG: Ruxolitinib
Rate of Clinical Response as Defined by the Percentage of Participants With Reduction at Week 24 From Baseline in the Bone Marrow Fibrosis Score, Overall response for the study drug is defined by the reduction in bone marrow fibrosis score which is on a scale of 0-3 where 0 indicates the scattered linear reticulin with no fiber intersections representing normal marrow and 3 indicates dense increase in reticulin fibrosis with fiber intersections, often with osteosclerosis. Reduction from baseline of score indicates improvement in clinical condition., Baseline; Week 24
Rate of Clinical Response as Defined by the Percentage of Participants With Improvement in Hemoglobin, Platelet, or Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC), Overall response for the study drug was defined by the rate of clinical improvement in hemoglobin, platelet or ANC. Clinical improvement in hemoglobin was defined as a ≥ 2 g/dL increase from baseline in hemoglobin level and transfusion independent (absence of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in prior 8 weeks and applicable only for participants with baseline hemoglobin level of \< 10 g/dL); clinical improvement in platelets was defined as a ≥ 100% increase from baseline in platelet count and an absolute platelet count of ≥ 50 x 10\^9/L (applicable only for participants with baseline platelet count \< 50 x 10\^9/L); clinical improvement in ANC is defined as a ≥ 100% increase from baseline in ANC and an ANC of ≥ 0.5 x 10\^9/L (applicable only for participants with baseline ANC \< 1 x 10\^9/L)., Baseline; Weeks 12, 24 and any time post baseline (enrollment up to 94 weeks)|Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), First dose date up to the last dose date (maximum: 94 weeks) plus 28 days|Change From Baseline in Myelofibrosis Symptoms Assessment Score, Myelofibrosis symptom assessment was performed using myeloproliferative neoplasm symptoms assessment form (MPN-SAF) which is a 27-item questionnaire to address symptom burden and quality of life. The form consists of 27 questions which are scored on a scale of 0-10 by participants based on how symptoms are affecting them, where 0 indicates less symptoms while 10 indicated more severe symptoms and greater inactivity. The MPN-SAF score was calculated at each visit for each participant as an average of the scales for each question and all answered questions. If the number of questions not answered at 1 visit was \> 10, then the MPN-SAF score for that visit was taken as missing. A negative change from Baseline indicated improvement., Baseline; Days 43 and 85 of Cycles 1-7 (cycle=12 weeks)|Change From Baseline in Cytokine Levels, Biomarker samples were collected to evaluate the effects of SIM treatment on markers of serum and plasma cytokines., Baseline; Week 24|Percentage of Participants With Anti-Simtuzumab Antibody Formation, Blood samples were collected for the presence of anti-SIM antibodies which was determined using a validated electro-chemiluminescent (ECL) assay screening test., Baseline; Day 85 of Cycles 1 to 5 (cycle=12 weeks)
