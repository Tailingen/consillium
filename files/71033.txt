A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Anti-PD-1 Antibody AK105 in Patients With Selected Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a multi-center, multi-cohort, open-label, phase Ib/II study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, PK characteristics, immunogenicity and potential biomarkers of AK105 monotherapy in the patients with selected advanced solid tumors.
Solid Tumor|Lung Cancer|HCC
DRUG: AK105
Objective response rate (ORR), The ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects with confirmed CR or confirmed PR, based on RECIST Version 1.1., Up to 2 years
Number of participants with adverse events (AEs), An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment., the time of informed consent signed through 90 days after the last dose of AK105|Disease control rate (DCR), The DCR is defined as the proportion of subjects with CR, PR, or SD (subjects achieving SD will be included in the DCR if they maintain SD for â‰¥8 weeks) based on RECIST Version 1.1., Up to 2 years|Duration of response (DoR), Duration of response is defined as the duration from the first documentation of objective response to the first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 2 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival is defined as the time from the start of treatment with AK104 until the first documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 2 years|Minimum observed concentration (Cmin) of AK105 at steady state, The endpoints for assessment of PK of AK104 include serum concentrations of AK105 at different timepoints after AK105 administration., From first dose of AK105 through to 90 days after last dose of AK105|Number of subjects who develop detectable anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), The immunogenicity of AK105 will be assessed by summarizing the number of subjects who develop detectable anti-drug antibodies (ADAs)., From first dose of AK105 through to 90 days after last dose of AK105
