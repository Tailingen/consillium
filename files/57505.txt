A TheraSphere® Advanced Dosimetry Retrospective Global Study in HCC
This retrospective, multinational, single-arm study will be conducted in at least 8 sites. An interim analysis will be conducted with data from 100 patients with up to 10 well defined HCC tumor(s) and with at least one tumor ≥3 cm. Normal tissue absorbed dose using pre-procedural 99mTc MAA SPECT or SPECT/CT imaging will be measured to allow the mean absorbed normal tissue dose corresponding to a ≤15% probability of CTCAE grade 3 or higher hyperbilirubinemia (in the absence of disease progression) to be calculated. Total bilirubin will be recorded and graded according to CTCAE version 4.02. All dose-related SAEs at 3 months follow-up will be followed until resolution, death or lost-to-follow-up. AEs related to disease progression will not be considered related to TheraSphere.

Alternative two-compartment TheraSphere dosimetry methodology, Normal tissue absorbed dose using pre-procedural 99mTc MAA (Technetium-99m Macroaggregated albumin) SPECT (Single-photon emission computer tomography) or SPECT/CT (Single-photon emission computer tomography/Computer Tomography) imaging, to allow the mean absorbed normal tissue dose corresponding to a ≤15% probability of Common Toxicities Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade 3 or higher hyperbilirubinemia (in the absence of disease progression) to be calculated., Baseline
Tumor dose, Tumor dose (to tumors ≥3 cm) using pre-procedural 99mTc MAA SPECT or SPECT/CT imaging., Baseline|Serious adverse events, All serious adverse events (SAEs) assessed as related or potentially related to TheraSphere, 3 months|Specific non-serious adverse events (AEs) assessed as related or potentially related to the dose of TheraSphere, Specific non-serious adverse events (AEs) assessed as related or potentially related to the dose of TheraSphere, comprising of any of the following events:

* Hyperbilirubinemia
* Ascites
* Pain
* Fatigue
* Nausea, 3 months|Clinical laboratory assessments, Clinical laboratory assessments, 6 weeks and 3 months|Objective response (OR) of the target lesion and non-target sesions, Objective response (OR) of the target lesion (single largest lesion) and non-target lesion(s) at 3 months and 6 months (if available), and for all scans up to 400 days after TheraSphere administration by Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST) and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, 3 months and 6 months|Volume changes, Volume changes (i.e., perfused liver volume and non-perfused liver volume) from baseline afterTheraSphere administration., 3 and 6 months|Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS), 6 months|Target Alpha fetoprotein (AFP) response, Target Alpha fetoprotein (AFP) response (defined as a ≥50% decrease in AFP levels for patients with a baseline AFP level of

≥200 ng/mL)., 6 weeks and 3 months|Albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score, Albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score, a measure of liver function for HCC patients after TheraSphere administration., 6 weeks and 3 months|Dose to Portal Vein Thrombosis (PVT), Dose to Portal Vein Thrombosis (PVT) based upon pre- and postprocedure imaging (if PVT present)., baseline, 90 days, 180 days|Dosimetric analysis time, Dosimetric analysis time (i.e., workflow)., baseline|Dose accuracy, Dose accuracy based upon phantom imaging studies., baseline|Dose reproducibility, Measurement of inter-observer agreement based on a round robin review of the same 20 patients obtained from a minimum of 8 users (with each user at a different site) and an exploratory assessment of intra-observer agreement based on a review of 10 patients by a minimum of 8 users at least 2 weeks apart. The 10 patients for the intra-observer agreement will be a subset of the patients included in the assessment of inter-observer agreement., baseline
Normal tissue dose and tumor dose using post-procedural PET/CT Imaging, Normal tissue dose and tumor dose (in tumors ≥3 cm) using post-procedural yttrium-90 Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) imaging; collection of these endpoints will allow an assessment of the correlation with the dose determined from preprocedural 99mTc MAA SPECT or SPECT/CT imaging., baseline
Recently published evidence indicates a correlation between yttrium-90 dose delivered to the tumor and normal tissue with safety and efficacy outcomes but there are no validated methods to consistently measure dose delivered to the tumor and normal tissue. In contrast to the standard clinical approach based on average dose to one target volume, this trial, sponsored by Biocompatibles UK, will explore an alternative two-compartment TheraSphere dosimetry methodology to calculate absorbed dose to tumor and normal tissue
