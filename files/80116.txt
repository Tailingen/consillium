LSFG-SKIN, Laser Speckle Flowgraphy
The purpose of this project is to quantify normal and abnormal skin blood flow regionally in different areas of the body(face, extremities, over burns and wounds) at baseline and over time in response to treatment or environmental changes, such as temperature, light and pressure.

DEVICE: laser speckle flowgraphy
Imaging Blood Flow, Imaging blood flow in the tissue is of major importance in the clinical environment, One visit
Laser speckle skin blood flow (LSFG-SKIN) will be recorded in normal subjects and in patients with disorders affecting skin capillary perfusion, which may include cardiovascular disorders, dermatologic disorders, skin wounds, ocular disorders, psychiatric disorders, and neurologic disorders.
