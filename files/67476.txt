The Efficacy and Safety of Fruquintinib Plus FOLFIRI/FOLFOX as Second-line Treatment in Patients With RAS-mutant Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
RAS mutations are found in nearly half of colorectal cancer patients. However, there is no targeted driver gene drugs have been approved for RAS-mutated patients. For RAS mutant metastatic colorectal cancer, the commonly used treatment regimen is bevacizumab combined with chemotherapy.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Fruquintinib|DRUG: FOLFIRI|DRUG: mFOLFOX6
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), time from enrollment to the first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Responses are according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as assessed by investigator, assessed up to 1 year
Objective response rate (ORR), the proportion of patients with complete response or partial response, using RECIST v 1.1., assessed up to 1 year|Disease Control Rate (DCR), the proportion of patients with complete response, partial response or stable disease, using RECIST v 1.1., assessed up to 1 year|Overall survival (OS), time from randomization to death from any cause., assessed up to 2 year
This is a single-center, open, single-arm study exploring the efficacy and safety of fruquintinib combined with FOLFIRI/FOLFOX in the treatment of RAS-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) who failed standard therapy. Patients will receive fruquinitinib combined with chemotherapy (FOLFOX or FOLFIRI regimens), which depend on the previous chemotherapy regimen (chemotherapy switch).
