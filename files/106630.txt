OTHER: Evolutionary Tumor Board (ETB)
ETB developing therapeutic strategies, The investigators want to demonstrate the ability of a multidisciplinary group, the ETB, to develop therapeutic strategies in participants without curative options. They plan to enroll 35 patients to this study over 3 years. The primary objective will be successfully met if they can develop an evolutionary based plan that differs from the participants options prior to presentation for at least 80%, or 28 of these participants., Baseline to up to 60 months from end of therapy
