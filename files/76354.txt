Salvage Surgery Following Downstaging of Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer by Targeted Therapy (SDANT)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of neoadjuvant targeted therapy followed by surgery in participants with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Osimertinib Mesylate
PFS, Progression-Free Survival, 3 year
OS, Overall Survival, 3 year|Resectability rate, Resectability rate is defined as the percentage of patients who were able to undergo surgery after neoadjuvant therapy., 1 year
Advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for a high proportion of lung cancer cases. Targeted therapy improve the survival in these patients, but acquired drug resistance will inevitably occur. If tumor downstaging is achieved after targeted therapy, could surgical resection before drug resistance improve clinical benefits for patients with advanced NSCLC? Here, the investigators conducted a clinical trial showing that for patients with advanced driver gene mutant NSCLC who did not progress after targeted therapy, salvage surgery (SS) could improve progression-free survival (PFS).
