Clinical Study to Compare the Pharmacokinetics and Safety of Ramucirumab Injection With Cyramza ® in Healthy Male Volunteers
Ramucirumab is a biosimilar drug of CYRAMZA® produced by Chiatai Tianqing Pharmaceutical Group Nanjing Shunxin Pharmaceutical Co., LTD. It is a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) antagonist. This single-center, randomized, double-blind, single-dose, parallel phase I study of Ramucirumab injection versus Cyramza ® in healthy male volunteers was designed to evaluate the similarities in pharmacokinetics, tolerance, safety and immunogenicity of Ramucirumab and CYRAMZA®.
