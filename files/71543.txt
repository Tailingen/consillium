A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy of MuGard for the Amelioration of Oral Mucositis in Head and Neck Cancer Patients
This study is a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, two-arm study conducted in subjects receiving chemoradiation therapy for the treatment of head and neck cancer to assess the efficacy of MuGard. The study will evaluate the ability of MuGard to reduce the symptoms of oral mucositis. The study includes a treatment period of approximately 7 weeks depending on the subject's prescribed radiation plan.

MuGard is a liquid that is classified as a medical device. It is a hydrated polymer system (oral hydrogel) and is intended for the management of oral mucositis/stomatitis. When gently distributed within the mouth, the mucoadhesive formulation results in the formation of a protective coating over the oral mucosa. Subjects undergoing chemotherapy with radiation for the treatment of head and neck cancer are at high risk of developing oral mucositis as an adverse side-effect of cancer treatment. MuGard was previously shown to reduce the incidence and severity of mucositis in head and neck cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy when compared with data from historical control groups. The purpose of this study is to perform a direct comparison of the effectiveness of MuGard with a control group.

To evaluate the efficacy of MuGard on reducing the symptoms of oral mucositis using an Oral Mucositis Daily Questionnaire (OMDQ), To evaluate the efficacy of MuGard administered every 3 hours up to six times a day (while awake) over approximately 7 weeks in subjects with head and neck cancers receiving up to a maximum cumulative radiation dose of 72 Gray (Gy) compared to sham control on reducing the symptoms of oral mucositis \[area-under-the-curve (AUC) of Oral Mucositis Daily Questionnaire (OMDQ) Mouth and Throat Soreness (MTS) Question 2\]., 7 weeks
To evaluate the efficacy of MuGard on delaying the onset of oral mucositis symptoms and reducing the impact on health and resource outcomes., To evaluate the efficacy of MuGard administered every 3 hours up to six times a day (while awake) in subjects with head and neck cancers receiving up to a maximum cumulative radiation dose of 72 Gy compared to sham control on delaying the onset of oral mucositis symptoms (OMDQ MTS Question 2) and reducing the impact on health and resource outcomes., Approximately 7 weeks
