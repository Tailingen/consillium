TNF Polymorphism and Implantation Rate
Do TNF-308 and -238 polymorphisms impact the embryo implantation rate after in vitro fertilization (IVF) in women without female infertility factor ?
Infertility
PROCEDURE: biological and ultrasound test
Implantation rate by biological test, 20 days after implantation|Implantation rate by ultrasound test, 20 days after implantation
This study was performed in order to verify whether TNF-308 allele was associated with a higher implantation rate and multiple pregnancy rates in women without known infertility factors after ovarian hyperstimulation with exogenous FSH for IVF
