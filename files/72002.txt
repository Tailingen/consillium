Clinical Study of Senl-T7 CAR T Cells in the Treatment of Relapsed and Refractory CD7+ Acute T-ALL/T-LBL
This is an open, prospective, dose-escalation clinical study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Senl-T7 in patients with relapsed or refractory CD7+ acute T lymphoblastic leukemia or T lymphoblastic lymphoma.Meanwhile, PK/PD indexes of Senl-T7 were collected.
T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: Senl-T7
Safety: Incidence and severity of adverse events, To evaluate the possible adverse events occurred within first one month after CD7 CAR-T infusion, including the incidence and severity of symptoms such as cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity, First 1 month post CAR-T cells infusion|Remission Rate, To obsere the efficacy of CAR-T cells after infusion, complete remission (CR), complete remission with incomplete recovery of blood cells (CRi), minimal tumor residual positive(MRD+) or negative (MRD-) CR/CRi, disease recurrence or progression (PD) will be used for evaluation., 3 months post CAR-T cells infusion
The CARs consist of an anti-CD7 single-chain variable fragment（scFv）, a portion of the human CD137（4-1BB） molecule, and the intracellular component of the human CD3ζ molecule. Prior to CAR-T cell infusion, the patients will be subjected to preconditioning treatment. After CAR-T cell infusion, the patients will be evaluated for adverse reactions and efficacy.
