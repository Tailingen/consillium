Camrelizumab Combined With Neoadjuvant Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy for Resectable Locally Advanced ESCC（NICE-RT）
NICE-RT study is a "safety run-in" and phase II trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of Camrelizumab combined with Nab-paclitaxel and Carboplatin and Radiotherapy in patients with resectable locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Chemotherapy (nab-paclitaxel AUC=2 and carboplatin 80mg/m2)，Immunotherapy (camrelizumab 200mg)、Radiotherapy(primary lesion and adjacent lymph nodes 41.4Gy， distant lymph node 0.5Gy*4)
Safety(The rates of grade 3 and higher-grade treatment-related adverse events), Incidence of adverse events using CTCAE 4.03;grade 3 treatment-related adverse events and higher-grade adverse event will be reported, From date of treatment allocation until surgery was applied during study period or up to at least 90 days after last dose|pCR, pathological complete response (pCR) is defined as disappearance of all invasive cancer after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 12 months
MPR, major pathologic response (MPR) is defined as residual viable tumor of less than or equal to 10%, 12 months|ORR, objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of patients with a complete response(CR) or partial response(PR) to treatment according to RECIST v1.1, 12 months|EFS, event-free survival (EFS) is defined as the time after treatment that a group of people in a clinical trial has not had cancer come back or get worse, 12 months|OS, overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from treatment to death, regardless of disease recurrence, 12 months
Considering that immunotherapy combined with concurrent chemoradiotherapy may have unknown AEs, in order to explore the safety and tolerability of the regimen of camrelizumab combined with nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin and radiotherapy, this study set up an initial "safety run-in" phase. 10 patients will be firstly enrolled, and treatment-related adverse reactions（TRAEs）and surgical complications will be observed at the same time. If the completion rate of neoadjuvant therapy and surgery is greater than 80%, rate of 30-day major complication is less than 20%,and no death, it will continue to enroll 40 patients to explore the efficacy and safety of the regimen. If the completion rate of neoadjuvant therapy and surgery is less than 80%, the MDT will determine whether the study move forward. If treatment related death is more than 1 patients, the study will be terminated.
