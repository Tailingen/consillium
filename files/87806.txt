Association of Anemia With Hospital Costs in Elective Colorectal Surgery
The objective is to measure the adjusted association between preoperative anemia and total hospital costs. We hypothesize that patients with anemia before surgery will have higher hospitalization costs than people without anemia.

Total Hospital Costs, Direct and indirect costs accrued during the index hospitalization. Costs were measured using standard and validated algorithms, standardized to 2016 CAD. This method accounts for a patient's resource intensity weight, their case mix group, as well as fixed patient costs (e.g., medications, investigations) and indirect costs to the hospital based on patient's location of care (intensive care unit versus ward) and length of stay., Hospital admission to date of discharge from hospital, or 365 days after admission, whichever came first
Length of Stay, Number of days in hospital after surgery, Date of surgery to date of hospital discharge, or up to one year after surgery (whichever comes first)|Red Blood Cell Transfusion, Any red blood cell transfusion received, Hospital admission to date of surgery, or 365 days after admission, whichever came first
This study will examine the association between preoperative anemia (hematocrit less than 0.39; low blood counts) and hospital total costs from elective colorectal surgery. Total costs will be defined as the combination of direct and indirect costs ascertained using standardized patient-level costing algorithms (i.e. the standard way that hospital measure their costs). Adjustment will be made for factors that are likely to influence both the presence of anemia and costs of care.
