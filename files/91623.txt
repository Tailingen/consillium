Phase II Metastatic ER+/PgR+ Nolvadex +/- Iressa Study
This study is being carried out to see if ZD1839 is effective in treating metastatic breast cancer in combination with Nolvadex, and if so, how it compares with Nolvadex alone.
Breast Neoplasms
DRUG: Gefitinib|DRUG: Tamoxifen
Strata 1: To compare the time to progression between 2 treatment arms (ZD1839/Nolvadex vs placebo/Nolvadex), Time to progression (progressive disease or death; equivalent to progression-free survival)|Strata 2: To compare the clinical benefit rate between 2 treatment arms (ZD1839/Nolvadex vs placebo/Nolvadex), Overall clinical benefit rate: Complete Response, Partial Response or Stable Disease > 24weeks after each combination
To compare the clinical benefit rate between 2 treatment arms (ZD1839/Nolvadex vs placebo/Nolvadex) in Strata 1 and overall, Overall clinical benefit rate: Complete Response, Partial Response or Stable Disease >24 weeks after each combination. Objective tumour resp defined according to RECIST criteria|To compare time to progression between 2 treatment arms (ZD1839/Nolvadex vs placebo/Nolvadex) in Strata 2 and overall, Time to progression (progressive disease or death)|To compare the objective response rate between ZD1839/Nolvadex and placebo/Nolvadex in each strata and overall, Objective tumour response (OR) defined according to RECIST criteria|To estimate duration of response for the ZD1839/Nolvadex and placebo/Nolvadex treatments in each strata and overall, Duration of response (CR and PR)|To compare overall survival between the ZD1839/Nolvadex and placebo/Nolvadex in each strata, Overall survival|To assess whether patients with high tumour levels of HER-2 and/or AIB1 demonstrate de novo resistance to Nolvadex therapy or have shorter TTP or response duration when compared with Nolvadex/ZD1839 treatment, Time to progression (progressive disease or death), duration of response (CR and PR)|To compare the objective response rate between the ZD1839/Nolvadex and placebo/Nolvadex treatment arms in the subset of all patients with ER+ tumours staining 2+/3+ for Her2neu by IHC, Objective tumour response (OR) defined according to RECIST criteria|To compare the safety and tolerability of ZD1839/Nolvadex to placebo/Nolvadex, Safety (frequency and severity of adverse events)|To determine steady-state plasma trough concentrations of tamoxifen in all patients and to compare between the ZD1839/Nolvadex and placebo/Nolvadex treatment arms, Tamoxifen (Cmin) steady-state plasma concentration|To determine steady-state plasma trough concentrations of ZD1839 and relate values to historical data, ZD1839 (Cmin) steady-state plasma concentration|To relate steady-state plasma trough concentrations of ZD1839 to demographic, response, and safety variables, ZD1839 (Cmin) steady-state plasma concentration|To assess the quality of life (QOL) and symptom relief based on the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Breast (FACT-B) on both treatment arms, FACT-B questionnaire, FBSI (FACT-B Symptom Index)|To investigate subject hospital resource use and health status, Hospitalisations and EQ-5D|Characterization of specific adverse events, Characterization of adverse events such as alopecia, rash and diarrhea|To obtain tumour tissue for biologic studies in this patient population, ER receptor, ErbB-1 &2 (immunohistochemistry) and other biological markers including Her2/neu, AIB1
