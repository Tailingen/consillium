Newly Enrolled Students in the Nursing Programs at Girne American University and Eastern Mediterranean University Will Participate in This Study as an Experimental Study With a Pretest/Posttest Control Group. The Students Will Receive the Same Training. Contrary to the Control Group, the Intervention Group Will Have the System Which Will Send Reminder Notifications (Via the Web Base) Directing Them to the Website Containing BSE Training, Along With the Vector Illustration to be Created for the Concurrent Practice Prepared by the Researcher on the Determined Ideal Day. Users Will Receive a Notification Twice Via the Website and Email That Includes Re-examination Seven Days Following the End of Their Period. Depending on the Permission They Grant to Their Phones, Users Will be Able to Access the BSE Training Materials on the Website by Clicking on the General Reminder Notification or the Router, Using Their Browsers, and Logging in to Their Accounts. The Data on the Frequency of BSE With the "Breast Cancer Fear Scale" and "Champion's Health Belief Model Scale" Will be Collected From the Users at the End of the Three-month Period of Using the Website, Which Will be Developed in Order to Raise the Chances of Early Diagnosis by Encouraging BSE.
