Aromatase (CYP19) Polymorphism Between AI-responsive and AI-resistant Breast Cancer in Korea
Aromatase(CYP19)inhibitor is one of the major antihormonal drug for breast cancer in postmenopausal women. The variation of CYP19 may affect the effect of aromatase inhibitor. However, the incidence of variation of CYP19 in Korea has not known. Therefore, the investigators want to know the incidence of variation of CYP19 and to assess the effect of these variations of CYP19 to aromatase inhibitor users.
