Changes in QoL in EoT visit (1 month after last SoC treatment).

Changes in QoL until disease progression in each monthly follow-up visit.

After disease progression, changes in QoL in each monthly follow up visit during the first 6 months; changes in bimonthly follow-up visits up to to 2 years from progression and changes in each follow-up visit every 6 months onwards.

The QoL scale ranges in score from 0 to 100, a high score represents a higher response level., From Day 1 in first treatment cycle (35-days) to last follow-up visit up to 3 years.|Disease Control Rate (DCR) to subsequent therapies, Disease Control Rate (DCR) defined as: stable disease (SD) + partial response (PR) + complete response (CR), From disease progression to exitus for any cause up to 3 years
Multi-center, open label, randomized, 2-parallel arm, phase IIb study of nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine as Standard of Care (SoC) plus/minus VCN-01 in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. Gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel are chemotherapy drugs approved by the FDA to treat pancreatic cancer. VCN-01 is a genetically modified adenovirus characterized by the presence of four independent genetic modifications in the backbone of the wild-type human adenovirus serotype 5 (HAd5) genome that confer tumor selective replication and antitumor activity. Approximately 92 patients in sites in North America and European Union (EU) will be recruited and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment arms (i.e., approximately 46 patients per treatment arm):

* Arm 1- (SoC): Nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine as SoC (28-day cycles). Patients in this arm will not receive the investigational medicinal product (IMP) VCN-01.
* Arm 2- (VCN-01+ SoC): A maximum of two (2) doses of VCN-01 administrated in combination with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine as SoC (28-day cycles with exception of the IMP dose cycles, which will be 35-day cycles).

A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be convened at regular intervals to assess safety and to look at OS to determine if the trial can continue.
