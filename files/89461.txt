Personalized Tumor Vaccines and Pabolizumab in Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
The main objective of this study was to observe and evaluate the safety and tolerability of mRNA-0217/S001 vaccine encoding personalized tumor neoantigens alone/in combination with Pembrolizumab injection for the treatment of Advanced Pancreatic Cancer. The secondary objective was to observe the preliminary efficacy of mRNA-0217/S001 personalized tumor vaccine in the treatment of advanced solid tumors with neoantigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte responses, objective tumor response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) caused by mRNA-0217/S001 personalized tumor vaccine.
Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Personalized neoantigen tumor vaccine
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or Dose-limiting toxicity(DLT),If MTD is not reached, Biologically Effective Dose (BED), The highest dose of a drug or treatment that does not cause unacceptable side effects., Up to 27 weeks|Reaction of antigen-specific T cells in peripheral blood, mRNA-0217/S001 personalized tumor vaccine induced neoantigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte responses, Up to 27 weeks|Objective response rate (ORR), ORR calculates the ratio of the number of patients whose best response is complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR) to the total number of evaluable patients according to RECIST 1.1 criteria. Those who have not been evaluated for lesion and tumor response will be regarded as non-evaluable patients and will not be counted., Up to 105 weeks|Disease control rate (DCR), DCR calculates the ratio of the number of patients whose best response is complete remission (CR), or partial remission (PR), or stable disease (SD) to the total number of evaluable patients according to RECIST 1.1 criteria. Those who have not been evaluated for lesion and tumor response will be regarded as non-evaluable patients and will not be counted., Up to 105 weeks
Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, During the trial conduction, all adverse events (including laboratory abnormality and clinical events) will be closely monitored, and all â‰¥ grade 3 adverse events per CTCAE (v 5.0) will be recorded, including but not limited to the toxicities potentially suspected to relate to injection procedures and/or mRNA Tumor Vaccine therapy as listed below:

Local erythema at the injection site, local allergic reactions at the injection site, fatigue, fever, chills, flu-like manifestations, vomiting, centrocytopenia, other unexpected adverse events, Up to 105 weeks|Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free Survival of Personalized mRNA Tumor Vaccine, Up to 105 weeks|overall survival (OS), Overall Survival of Personalized mRNA Tumor Vaccine, Up to 3 years
