A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy, Safety and PD and PK of HBM9161 in MG Patients
Primary Objectives: To investigate the efficacy of HBM9161 in patients with attack of MG in China
Myasthenia Gravis
DRUG: HBM9161 Injection (680mg and 340 mg)|DRUG: Placebos|DRUG: HBM9161 Injection (340 mg)
Change in the Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score from baseline to Day 43, The MG-ADL profile provides an assessment of MG symptom severity and measures 8 items on a 0-3 scale, with 0 being the least severe. The total sum of the 13 items represents the ADL score. The ADL score can range from 0 (least severe) to 24 (most severe), 43 days
Change in the Myasthenia Gravis Composite (MGC) score from baseline to Day 43, The total QMG score is obtained by summing the responses to each individual item (13 items; Responses: None=0, Mild=1, Moderate=2, Severe=3). The score ranges from 0 to 39, with lower scores indicating lower disease activity., 43 days|Change in the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score from baseline to Day 43, The QMG test is a standardized quantitative strength scoring system and measures 13 items on a 0-3 scale, with 0 being the least severe. The total sum of the 13 items represents the QMG score. The QMG score can range from 0 (least severe) to 39 (most severe)., 43 days|Change in the Myasthenia Gravis Quality of Life 15(MG-QoL15r) score from baseline to Day 43, The MG-QoL 15r scale is a patient-reported score that assesses the patient's perception of impairment and disability and the degree to which the patient tolerates disease manifestations. Each question was graded on a 3-point scale from 0=normal to 2=severe with a score of 0 to 30; the higher score indicates worse MG disease activity, 43 days|Proportion of participants with a decrease on the MG-ADL Score by ≥ 2 points from baseline to Day 43, 43 days|Proportion of participants with an improvement and worse on the MGFA Post-intervention Status (MGFA-PIS) from baseline to Day 43. o Improvement: MGC Score reduce ≥ 3 points o Aggravation: MGC Score increase ≥ 3 points, 43 days|Change in the MG-ADL score from baseline to Day 120, 120 days|Change in the MGC score from baseline to Day 120, 120 days|Change in the QMG score from baseline to Day 120, 120 days|Change in the MG-QoL15r score from baseline to Day 120, 120 days|Proportion of participants with persistent improvement on the MGC score from baseline to Day 120, Improvement (decrease) in the MGC score by ≥ 3 points for 6 weeks, 120 days|Proportion of participants with persistent improvement on the MG-ADL score from baseline to Day 120, Improvement (decrease) in the MG-ADL Score by ≥ 2 points for 6 weeks, 120 days
This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled study. The investigational drug is HBM9161 injection, and the indication is MG.

The subjects will be randomized to three dose groups (340mg, 680mg and placebo) for a 6 weeks' double-blind treatment period followed by an open-label extension treatment period. The study will investigate the safety, efficacy and pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic of HBM9161 in patients with attack of MG in China.
