Antibiotic Prophylaxis in Rectal Cancer Surgery: Oral With Intravenous Versus Intravenous Antibiotics.
This is a randomized, controlled, parallel study to determine the efficiency of oral antibiotics in reduction of surgical site infection (SSI) in rectal cancer surgery.
Rectal Cancer
DRUG: Oral antibiotic|DRUG: Intravenous antibiotic|DRUG: Mechanical Bowel Preparation
Rate of Surgical Site Infection, 0 to 30 days
Patients undergoing rectal cancer surgery in a single centre will assigned randomly to combined preoperative oral antibiotics (metronidazole and erythromycin) and perioperative intravenous antibiotics (cefmetazole) (oral+intravenous group) or to perioperative intravenous antibiotics (cefmetazole) alone (intravenous group). The primary endpoint is the overall rate of SSI.
