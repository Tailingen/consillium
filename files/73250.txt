First-in-man Dose Escalation Study of BAY2010112 in Patients With Prostate Cancer
This is the first study where BAY2010112 is given to humans. Patients with castration resistant prostate cancer will be treated. Every patient will receive drug treatment, there is no placebo group. Patients will receive different dosages of BAY2010112 to determine the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BAY2010112.

The study will also assess the pharmacokinetics and the clinical efficacy of BAY2010112.

BAY2010112 will be given daily as subcutaneous injection or as continuous intravenous infusion. Treatment will be stopped if the tumor continues to grow, if side effects, which the patient cannot tolerate, occur or if the patient decides to exit treatment.

BIOLOGICAL: BAY2010112|BIOLOGICAL: BAY2010112
Number of participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, Up to 2 years or longer if indicated|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), MTD is measured by adverse event profile at the end of Cycle 1. MTD will be the highest dose level achieved during dose escalation where the incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) is below 20%, Up to 2 years or longer if indicated
Maximum drug concentration (Cmax) of BAY2010112 in serum after single and multiple doses administration, Cycle 1 Day1 and 15; (1 Cycle is 21 days long)|Area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) from zero to infinity after single (first) and multiple doses of BAY2010112, Cycle 1 (1 Cycle is 21 days long)|Tumor response, Tumor response is measured by measurable lesions, Up to 2 years or longer if indicated|Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, PSA response is measured by maximum decline in PSA that occurs at any point after treatment, Up to 2 years or longer if indicated
