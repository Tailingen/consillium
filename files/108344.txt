Assessment the Cancer Risk of Indeterminate Thyroid Nodules Through Integration of Clinical, Ultrasonographic and Multiomic Features
Indeterminate thyroid nodules have a mild risk of malignancy (15-30%). The aim of our study is to individuate new biomarkers of thyroid carcinoma through multiomic analyses of blood samples and of specimen samples of patients with indeterminate thyroid nodules.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Multiomic analyses of blood and surgical specimens
Identification of biomarkers of thyroid carcinoma, Identification of alterations in cfDNA length and integrity, presence of SNPs in cfDNA, alterations of serum proteome predictive of thyroid carcinoma, 50 months
Elaboration of diagnostic algorithm, Elanoration of diagnostic algorithm predictive of thyroid carcinoma through integration of clinical, ultrasonographic and multiomic variables able to predict che condition of thyroid cancer in patients with indeterminate thryoid nodules, 60 months
