Use of Integrated PET/CT as a First Line Staging and Re-staging Technique in Oncologic Patient.
Positron emission tomoscintigraphy (PET) and contrast computed tomography (CTmdc) are diagnostic methods widely used in the staging and restaging of neoplastic diseases. In recent years, PET tomographs have been implemented, integrating a CT scanner into the PET tomograph (PET/CT): these tomographs are able to simultaneously acquire the function/metabolism study (PET) and the morgfostructural study (CT).

Numerous clinical studies have demonstrated the added diagnostic value of PET/CT compared to PET with consequent effect on the choice of treatment type. In addition to the potential clinical value deriving from the simultaneous execution of the two diagnostic methods, it is necessary to consider the possibility of a reduction in indirect costs deriving from the reduction of days of work lost and costs related to transport, both for the patient and for any companions.

The aims of this multicenter observational study are:

1. evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of PET/CT, contrast-enhanced CT and contrast-enhanced PET/CT+CT performed in a single examination session (single staging) in cancer patients (patients suffering from lymphoma and lung cancer).
2. evaluate any psychological, quality of life and economic benefits deriving from carrying out the two diagnostic procedures in a single examination session.
