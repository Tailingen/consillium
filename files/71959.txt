An Investigational Immuno-therapy Study to Investigate the Safety and Effectiveness of Nivolumab, and Nivolumab Combination Therapy in Virus-associated Tumors
The purpose of this study to investigate the safety and effectiveness of nivolumab, and nivolumab combination therapy, to treat patients who have virus-associated tumors. Certain viruses have been known to play a role in tumor formation and growth. This study will investigate the effects of the study drugs, in patients who have the following types of tumors:

* Anal canal cancer-No longer enrolling this tumor type
* Cervical cancer
* Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) positive gastric cancer-No longer enrolling this tumor type
* Merkel Cell Cancer
* Penile cancer-No longer enrolling this tumor type
* Vaginal and vulvar cancer-No longer enrolling this tumor type
* Nasopharyngeal Cancer - No longer enrolling this tumor type
* Head and Neck Cancer - No longer enrolling this tumor type
Various Advanced Cancer
DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: Ipilimumab|DRUG: Relatlimab|DRUG: Daratumumab
Neoadjuvant: Number of Participants With Drug-Related Select Adverse Events (AEs), Number of participants with any grade of drug-related select adverse events (AEs) including endocrine, gastrointestinal, hepatic, pulmonary, renal, skin, and hypersensitivity AEs in Neoadjuvant cohort, From first dose to 30 days post last dose (Up to 2 months)|Neoadjuvant: Number of Participants With Drug-Related Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Number of participants with any grade of drug-related serious adverse events (SAEs) in Neoadjuvant cohort, From first dose to 30 days post last dose (Up to 2 months)|Neoadjuvant: Rate of Surgery Delay, Rate of surgery delay is defined as the percentage of participants in the neoadjuvant cohort with surgery delayed \> 4 weeks from the planned surgery date or planned start date for chemoradiation due to a drug-related adverse event.

Participants with the following diseases will be assessed:

1. HPV positive squamous cell carcinoma of the Head and Neck (SCCHN);
2. HPV negative SCCHN;
3. Cervical Carcinoma;
4. Vaginal/Vulvar Carcinoma;
5. Merkel Cell Carcinoma, Day 29|Metastatic: Investigator-Assessed Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response (BOR) of confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) using RECIST 1.1 criteria. An ORR in excess of 10% will be considered of clinical interest, and an ORR of 25% or greater will be considered of strong clinical interest.

Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \< 10 mm.

Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.

Participants with the following diseases will be assessed:

1. EBV positive related gastric cancer;
2. HPV positive SCCHN;
3. Other anogenital HPV associated cancers;
4. GYN (Cervical, Vaginal, Vulvar) carcinoma;
5. Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC);
6. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), From the date of first dose to the date of the initial objectively documented tumor progression or the date of the last tumor assessment prior to subsequent therapy (Up to 65 months)
Metastatic: Investigator-Assessed Duration of Response (DoR), Duration of response (DoR) is defined as the time from first confirmed response (complete response or partial response) to the date of the initial objectively documented tumor progression as determined per investigator assessment using RECIST 1.1 criteria or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Participants with the following diseases will be assessed:

1. EBV positive related gastric cancer;
2. HPV positive SCCHN;
3. Other anogenital HPV associated cancers;
4. GYN (Cervical, Vaginal, Vulvar) carcinoma;
5. Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC);
6. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) NOTE: "Cervical, Randomized" and "Cervical, Pooled" are not mutually exclusive categories., From first confirmed response (complete response or partial response) to the date of the initial objectively documented tumor progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first (Up to 83 months)|Metastatic: Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from first dosing date to the date of death. A participant who has not died will be censored at last known date alive. Participants with the following diseases will be assessed:

1. EBV positive related gastric cancer;
2. HPV positive SCCHN;
3. Other anogenital HPV associated cancers;
4. GYN (Cervical, Vaginal, Vulvar) carcinoma;
5. Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC);
6. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) Note: "Cervical, Randomized" and "Cervical, Pooled" are not mutually exclusive categories, From the first dosing date to the date of death (Up to 83 months)|Metastatic: Investigator-Assessed Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Investigator-assessed progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from first dosing date to the date of the first documented tumor progression, as determined by investigators (per RECIST 1.1), or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Participants with the following diseases will be assessed:

1. EBV positive related gastric cancer;
2. HPV positive SCCHN;
3. Other anogenital HPV associated cancers;
4. GYN (Cervical, Vaginal, Vulvar) carcinoma;
5. Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC);
6. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) Note: "Cervical, Randomized" and "Cervical, Pooled" are not mutually exclusive categories, From the first dosing date to the date of the first documented tumor progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first (Up to 83 months)
