QUILT-3.076: Study of Autologous M-CENK in Subjects With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is a two-part, open-label phase 1 study to evaluate safety and preliminary efficacy of M-CENK Suspension for Infusion, Cryopreserved, and N-803 for subcutaneous administration in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The study consists of two cohorts: cohort 1 includes subjects with either newly diagnosed solid tumors who have not received prior therapy or subjects who have received prior first line treatment; and cohort 2 that includes subjects with relapsed/refractory (r/r) solid tumors who have progressive disease after receiving ≥ 2 prior therapies. The two cohorts will be conducted simultaneously.

Both cohorts will be enrolled simultaneously. Both cohorts have a part A (apheresis) and cohort 2 has a part B (M-CENK treatment \[one bag has a 100 mL cell suspension containing 0.25 to 0.75 x 109 cells\] and N-803 treatment).

Up to 40 subjects may be enrolled in cohort 1. Subjects in cohort 1 will participate in apheresis collection of MNCs prior to receiving disease specific first-line therapy per primary oncologists' recommendations. Subjects who have completed apheresis in cohort 1 may subsequently enroll in cohort 2 part B if they have progressive disease after ≥ 2 prior therapies or if they have progressive disease within 12 months of receiving neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy.

They must also meet the inclusion criteria to participate in the treatment phase (cohort 2 part B). Additionally, all subjects will be re-evaluated to confirm that they still meet the specified eligibility criteria once the M-CENK cells are manufactured and prior to the first administration of M-CENK. The Sponsor will approve the subject's continued eligibility prior to receiving the manufactured M-CENK cells.

Up to 21 subjects may be enrolled in cohort 2 part A so that up to 11 subjects receive at least 1 dose of M-CENK. A dose is a single administration of M-CENK cells or a single administration of N-803. Subjects in cohort 2 part A will undergo an apheresis collection of MNCs prior to receiving approximately 4 weeks of disease-specific therapy per oncologists' recommendations while the M-CENK cells are being manufactured for use in the treatment phase (cohort 2 part B). Subjects will be evaluated for eligibility in inclusion/exclusion criteria prior to enrollment into part B. Additionally, all subjects will be re-evaluated to confirm that they still meet the specified eligibility criteria once the M-CENK cells are manufactured and prior to the first administration of M-CENK. The Sponsor will approve the subject's continued eligibility prior to receiving the manufactured M-CENK cells.

M-CENK cells, manufactured from the autologous apheresis product, may be administered up to 10 times weekly starting on study day 1 with a minimum of 7 days between each M-CENK dose depending on the availability of cells and that there is no contra-indication to administer cells. Subjects will receive up to 5 doses of N-803 SC every 2 weeks prior to every other dose of M-CENK (ie, odd number M-CENK doses).The treatment may be administered for up to 10 doses of M-CENK, if the subject tolerates treatment, the doses of M-CENK cells are available, and the Investigator believes there may be potential benefit to the subject.

Safety endpoints include assessments of TEAEs, SAEs, and clinically significant changes in safety laboratory tests, and vital signs. Toxicities will be graded using CTCAE Version 5.0, or in the case of CRS, using a specified grading system. Safety will be monitored throughout the study.

The treatment of the initial 3 subjects in cohort 2 part B will be staggered with at least a 2-week interval between each subject. After the first 3 subjects in cohort 2 part B are treated, the treatment of existing subjects in cohort 2 part B will be paused after the 14-day toxicity assessment period for a safety evaluation by the Safety Review Committee (SRC). Based on the SRC safety evaluation, the treatment of the subsequent subjects can proceed if the safety evaluation from the initial 3 subjects in part B suggests that the therapy is safe. There will be another safety review after all subjects in cohort 2 have completed the 14-day toxicity assessment period.
