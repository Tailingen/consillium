A Dose-Finding Study of Birabresib (MK-8628), a Small Molecule Inhibitor of the Bromodomain and Extra-Terminal (BET) Proteins, in Adults With Selected Advanced Solid Tumors (MK-8628-003)
Open-label, phase I, non-randomized, multicentric study of single-agent birabresib (MK-8628) (formerly known as OTX015) administered according to two distinct regimens to participants with selected advanced tumors.

The study will be performed in two parts.

Dose Escalation Part:

This step is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in each of the two regimens, which will be evaluated in parallel. Participants will receive oral birabresib according to:

Continuous Dosing Regimen: continuous, once daily for 21 consecutive days (21-day cycles).

OR Days 1-7 Dosing Regimen: once daily on Days 1 to 7, repeated every 3 weeks (21-day cycles; 1 week ON/2 weeks OFF).

Participants will be sequentially assigned to Continuous Dosing Regimen or Days 1-7 Dosing Regimen according to the next available place and receive birabresib at escalating doses levels (DL). Cohorts of 3 participants will be treated, and an additional 3 participants will be treated at the first indication of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). MTD assessment will be based on the tolerability observed during the first 21 days of treatment.

Expansion Part:

The efficacy of birabresib in each of the five indications (i.e., Bromodomain-Nuclear Protein in Testis \[BRD-NUT\] midline carcinoma, triple negative breast cancer \[TNBC\], non-small cell lung cancer \[NSCLC\] harboring a rearrangement Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase \[ALK\] gene/fusion protein or Kirsten Ras \[KRAS\] mutation, castrate-resistant prostate cancer, and pancreatic ductal carcinoma) will be assessed in terms of response (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1 \[RECIST v1.1\] or Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 \[PCWG2\]) using a selected regimen.

DRUG: Birabresib
Number of Participants Who Experienced a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) During Cycle 1, A DLT was defined as any of the following toxicities that were considered by the investigator to be related to MK-8628: Hematologic toxicity: Grade 4 hematologic toxicity or febrile neutropenia, Grade 3 neutropenia with infection, Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding or lasting \>7 days; Non-hematologic toxicity: Grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity (regardless of duration) unless it was not optimally managed with supportive care, Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormality, with or without symptoms, lasting \>48 hours, Intolerable Grade 2 non-hematologic toxicity resulting in study drug discontinuation or delay \>7 days with or without dose reduction, Designated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) liver test abnormalities; Treatment delay \>2 weeks or dose reduction requirement for initiating Cycle 2., Up to Cycle 1 Day 21 (Up to 21 days)
Number of Participants Who Experienced at Least One Adverse Event (AE), An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with use of study treatment in humans, whether or not considered treatment related. The number of participants who experienced at least one AE is presented., Up to approximately 17.5 months (Up to 30 days after last dose of study treatment)|Number of Participants Who Discontinued Study Treatment Due to an AE, The number of participants who discontinued study treatment due to an AE is presented., Up to approximately 16.5 months|Best Overall Response as Assessed in Solid Tumors by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) or in Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) by Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group (PCWG2) Response Criteria, The best overall response was the best response recorded from the start of the study treatment until the end of treatment. RECIST 1.1 response categories included: Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions; and Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD., Up to approximately 16.5 months|Observed Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of MK-8628, Blood samples were obtained at specified time points for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis of the observed Cmax of MK-8628.
