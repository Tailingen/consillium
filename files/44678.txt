A Study of LY2875358 in Participants With Advanced Cancer
The objective of this study is to determine a recommended Phase 2 dose range of LY2875358 that may be safely administered to participants with advanced cancer. In Part A and Part A2 of this study, escalating doses of LY2875358 as monotherapy and in combination with erlotinib will be evaluated for safety and tolerability, respectively. Part B is a dose-confirmation segment for LY2875358 therapy in 5 different types of cancer: nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) with bone metastases, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), or uveal melanoma with liver metastases, and for LY2875358 in combination with trametinib in participants with uveal melanoma with liver metastases.

Protocol amendment (November, 2013) expanded Part B to study LY2875358 in combination with trametinib in participants with uveal melanoma with liver metastasis.
