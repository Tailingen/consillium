Feasibility and Safety Study of Nivolumab With Irinotecan for Small Cell Lung Cancer
This study will determine the frequency of adverse events (side effects) in patients with relapsed or refractory small cell lung cancer (SCLC) when given nivolumab and irinotecan together followed by nivolumab maintenance. This study will test the safety of the study treatments when given together and see what effect (good or bad) it has on participants and their cancer.
