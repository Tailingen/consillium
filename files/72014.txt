Nipple Aspirate Fluid in Detecting Breast Cancer
This trial studies nipple aspirate fluid in detecting breast cancer. Nipple aspirate fluid may better detect breast cancer earlier than current methods used for screening such as mammograms and breast examinations.

PROCEDURE: Aspiration of Breast|PROCEDURE: Biospecimen Collection
Biomarkers expression levels, Nipple aspiration fluid samples will be compared between breast cancer participants and healthy participants. will perform the logistic regression model for each biomarker that shows any difference between the breast cancer patients and healthy individuals. Then we will include multiple biomarkers in one model while controlling for confounders., Up to 1 year
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To obtain nipple aspirate fluid (NAF) samples from non-lactating women subjects at least 40-years-old.

II. To analyze the samples using a novel protein nanopore-based detection platform to evaluate the efficacy of the platform for breast cancer diagnosis through detection of biomarkers.

OUTLINE:

Participants and healthy volunteers undergo collection of nipple aspirate fluid from both breasts.

After completion of study, participants are followed up at 1 year.
