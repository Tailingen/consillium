PET in Breast Cancer Receiving Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
Prognostic factors in locally advanced breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy differ from those of early breast cancer.

The purpose of this study was to identify the clinical significance of potential predictive and prognostic factors including serial FDG PET/CT in breast cancer patients treated by neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: docetaxel (75 mg/m2) and doxorubicin (50 mg/m2)
pathologic complete response, The primary end point of this trial was evaluating pathologic complete response (pCR) rate. After 3 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, patients were undertook breast surgery. Using post operative pathology specimen, we evaluated pathologic response and calculated pCR rate., after completion of 3 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (9 weeks after initiation of chemotherapy)
survival (Relapse-free survival, overall survival), Relapse-free survival, overall survival were estimated by Kaplan-Meier product limit methods, 2years , 3 years and 5 years after initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy|early metabolic response, Early metabolic response were evaluated by serial FDG PET/CT before and after 1cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (15th days after 1cycle). Declining of SUV were calculated, before chemotherapy, and after 1cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (15th days after 1cycle)|predictive factors, Predictive factors for pathologic complete response were analyzed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis, after completion of 3 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (9 weeks after initiation of chemotherapy)|hematologic toxicity, Hematologic toxicities are evaluated every q 3weeks during chemotherapy. Neutropenia,thrombocytopenia, and anemia are evaluated during chemotherapy (per cycles) by NCI CTCAE v3.0 criteria., every q 3weeks during chemotherapy (up to 24 weeks from initiation of chemotherapy)
