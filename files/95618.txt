Ultrasound-assisted CNSs Mapping Versus Dual-tracer-guided Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy
The investigators suggested ultrasound-assisted Carbon nanoparticle suspensions (CNSs) mapping had great clinical value in clinical application and might serve as a useful alternative to the dual-tracer-guided SLNB. The investigators designed this prospective, randomized controlled phase 3 trial, to compare the feasibility and diagnostic performance of ultrasound-assisted carbon nanoparticle suspensions mapping versus dual-tracer-guided sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with early breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: UC group: ultrasound-assisted CNSs guided|PROCEDURE: GC group: CNSs plus ICG dual-tracer-guided
The identification rate of SLNs, Defined as the number of patients who at least one SLN were detected divided by the total number of patients included., within 14 days of SLNB
The mean number of SLNs collected, Defined as the number of tracer-stained or palpable SLNs divided by the number of patients whose SLNs were identified., within 14 days of SLNB|Operative time, Defined as the time from skin incision to resection of the SLNs specimens in patients whose at least one SLN were detected., within 14 days of SLNB|Intraoperative or postoperative complications, An adverse event is any untoward, undesired, and/or unplanned clinical event in the form of signs, symptoms, disease, or laboratory testing, or physiological observations occurring in a human participating in a clinical study with a study drug, regardless of causal relationship., within 30 days of SLNB
Identification rate of SLNs in post-NCT patients, Defined as the number of patients who at least one SLN were detected divided by the total number of patients included in NCT subgroup., within 14 days of SLNB
The study was a single-center, open-label, randomized controlled, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial. Eligible participants were 18 year's of age or older and had histologically confirmed primary invasive breast cancer, or ductal carcinoma in situ scheduled for mastectomy, without clinical or radiological nodal involvement (cN0) or with clinical positive lymph nodes (cN1) that were downstaged to cN0 following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT); and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0 or 1. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) using a permuted block randomization scheme to receive either ultrasound-assisted CNSs (UC group) or CNSs plus ICG dual-tracer-guided (GC group) SLN mapping.
