ADG126 in Combination With Pembrolizumab in Patients With Advanced/Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1b/2, open-label, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and immunogenicity of ADG126-pembrolizumab combination regimens in patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumors.

This is a Phase 1b/2, open-label, multicenter, dose escalation and dose expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and preliminary efficacy of ADG126-Pembrolizumab alone or ADG126-Pembrolizumab in combination with trifluridine/tipiracil-bevacizumab or fruquintinib in patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumors, with a focus on MSS CRC.

The study drug ADG126 is an anti-CTLA-4 fully human monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to human CTLA-4. Pembrolizumab is a PD-1 receptor-blocking antibody (a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody).
