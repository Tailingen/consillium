Association Between the Results of Specific Genetic Tests and the Efficacy of Targeted Therapies in Patients
Our study aimed to evaluate the correlation between test reagent specific gene test results and the efficacy of relevant targeted drugs in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, and to support the continued registration of test reagents.
