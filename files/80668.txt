VitalTraq for the Detection of CRS
The purpose of this study is to evaluate two vital sign monitoring devices, TempTraq and VitalTraq, in patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing therapy with Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (CAR-T) or Bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTE) products. TempTraq is an axillary patch that is worn on the skin and continuously monitors a patient's body temperature. VitalTraq is a smartphone application that utilizes remote photoplethysmography technology via a 30-second facial scan to estimate the patient's blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), and respiratory rate. These remote vital sign monitoring devices have the potential to promote earlier detection and intervention of treatment-related toxicities, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and febrile neutropenia.
Hematologic Malignancy
DEVICE: TempTraq|DEVICE: VitalTraq
TempTraq's ability to measure axillary temperature in the intended use population., Body temperature (degrees Celsius) data will be measured as a continuous variable via the TempTraq device and via standard-of-care oral thermometers., Day 14
Lead time by which fevers can be detected using TempTraq compared to SOC interval oral thermometer measurements., The times to first detection of fever, if applicable, will be measured for each patient using temperature data derived from the TempTraq device and standard-of-care oral thermometers. The mean time to first fever (i.e., temperature \> 38 degrees Celsius), will be calculated and described for both the TempTraq device and standard-of-care oral thermometers., Day 14|VitalTraq's ability to measure blood pressure in the intended use population., Determined by use of an equivalence test to test the hypothesis that there is no difference in the systolic and diastolic measurements using VitalTraq compared to SOC interval vitals measurements. The smallest tolerable differences in systolic and diastolic blood pressure are set to be 20 mmHg and 10 mmHg, respectively., Day 14|VitalTraq's ability to measure heart rate in the intended use population., Determined by use of an equivalence test to test the hypothesis that there is no difference in the heart rate measurements using VitalTraq compared to SOC interval oral thermometer measurements. The smallest tolerable difference is set to be 10 beats per minute., Day 14|Patient's perspective on the burden of using TempTraq and VitalTraq., The mean scores on individual questions in a post-intervention survey featuring 7-point Likert scale responses, where 1=strongly agree and 7=strongly disagree, will be calculated and described. A lower score indicates lower burden., Day 28|Lead time by which TempTraq and VitalTraq can detect grade 2 or higher Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) as compared to the standard of care., The times to first detection of grade 2 or higher CRS, if applicable, will be measured for each patient using vitals data derived from the TempTraq and VitalTraq devices, as well as via standard-of-care vitals measurements. The mean time to first detection of grade 2 or higher CRS will be calculated and described for both the investigational devices and standard-of-care monitoring., Day 14
