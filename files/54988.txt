Study of the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of XL765 (SAR245409) in Adults With Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of XL765. XL765 is a new chemical entity that inhibits the kinases PI3K and mTOR. In preclinical studies, inactivation of PI3K has been shown to inhibit growth and induce apoptosis (programmed cell death) in tumor cells, whereas inactivation of mTOR has been shown to inhibit the growth of tumor cells.
