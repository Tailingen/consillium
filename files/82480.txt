A Study of Trastuzumab Emtansine in Participants With Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (HER)2 Immunohistochemistry (IHC)-Positive, Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
This is a Phase 2, multicenter study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab emtansine administered as a single-agent in participants with HER2-positive (HER2 IHC 2+ or HER2 IHC 3+) advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Participants will be treated with trastuzumab emtansine administered intravenously at a dose of 3.6 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) on Day 1 of 21-day cycles until disease progression (as assessed by the investigator), unmanageable toxicity, or study termination by the Sponsor, whichever occurs first.

Participants with no post-baseline response assessment are considered as experiencing no clinical benefit. CR: disappearance of all target lesions; and any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \< 10 mm.
