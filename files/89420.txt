High Resolution Ultrasound in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma
Pancreatic cancer patients at UHN who have had a CT at UHN and have surgery planned will undergo a high resolution ultrasound pre-operatively and intra-operatively. This study is being done to see if using high resolution ultrasound before and during surgery will help the doctors accurately diagnose pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and identify if the disease has spread to other areas of the body.
Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma
DEVICE: Ultrasound
High-resolution U/S will be used to measure vascular invasion and regional lymph node metastases in PDAC, The U/S results will be compared to pre-operative CT scan to help determine the diagnostic effectiveness of High Resolution US, within 2 weeks of surgery
