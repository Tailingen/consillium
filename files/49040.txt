Central Line-associated Bloodstream Infection Prevention Using TauroLock-Hep100 in Pediatric Oncology Patients.
The goal of this assessor blinded randomized controlled trial is to compare a lock solution containing taurolidine, citrate and heparin to a heparin only lock solution for the prevention of central line associated bloodstream infections in paediatric oncology patients with a central venous access device.
Central Line-associated Bloodstream Infection (CLABSI)
DEVICE: TauroLock-Hep100 (taurolidine 1.35%, citrate 4%, heparin 100 IU/mL)|DEVICE: Heparin lock (heparin 100 IU/mL)
Incidence of central line associated bloodstream infections, From central venous access device insertion until the end of follow-up (maximum of 90 days).
Time to first central line associated bloodstream infection, From central venous access device insertion until the end of follow-up (maximum of 90 days).|Central line associated bloodstream infection incidence per 1,000 central venous access device-days, From central venous access device insertion until the end of follow-up (maximum of 90 days).|Incidence of symptomatic central venous thrombosis, From central venous access device insertion until the end of follow-up (maximum of 90 days).|Incidence of bacteraemia, From central venous access device insertion until the end of follow-up (maximum of 90 days).|Incidence of local infections, From central venous access device insertion until the end of follow-up (maximum of 90 days).|Dispense of thrombolysis/systemic antibiotic treatment due to central line associated bloodstream infections/ central venous thrombosis, From central venous access device insertion until the end of follow-up (maximum of 90 days).|Incidence of and reasons for central venous access device-removal, From central venous access device insertion until the end of follow-up (maximum of 90 days).|Cultured microorganisms causing central line associated bloodstream infections, From central venous access device insertion until the end of follow-up (maximum of 90 days).|Days of hospital admission due to central line associated bloodstream infections/ central venous thrombosis, From central venous access device insertion until the end of follow-up (maximum of 90 days).|Safety in terms of known side effects, severe adverse events, intensive care unit admission, and mortality rate due to central line associated bloodstream infections/central venous thrombosis, From central venous access device insertion until the end of follow-up (maximum of 90 days).
