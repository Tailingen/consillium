A Safety and Effectiveness Study of Vaccine Therapy in Patients With Indolent Lymphoma
Primary Objectives:

* To document the efficacy of treatment with autologous lymphoma-derived HSPPC-96 of selected patients with indolent lymphoma. The efficacy endpoints are:
* the rate of complete and partial responses
* the time to progression.

Secondary Objectives:

* To evaluate the safety and tolerability of autologous tumor-derived heat-shock protein peptide complex (HSPPC-96) administered intradermally once weekly for four consecutive weeks, followed by HSPPC-96 administered once every two weeks.
* To evaluate the feasibility of autologous HSPPC-96 preparation from lymphoma specimens.
* To assess approximately the composition of the tissue source of the autologous HSPPC-96 for each patient.
* To study the effect of autologous lymphoma-derived HSPPC-96 vaccine therapy on the expression of Fas ligand and TRAIL death proteins in peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients with indolent lymphoma.
