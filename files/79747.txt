A prospective study of Fruquintinib combined with TAS-102 for the posterior line treatment of advanced colorectal cancer is ongoing (NCT05004831). Both Fuquinitinib and TAS-102 are oral drugs, which are convenient to use and avoid the burden of frequent hospitalization. Whether this combination has considerable efficacy in gastric cancer is not clear.
