A Phase I Study Investigating the Combination of the Menin Inhibitor Ziftomenib With Venetoclax and Gemtuzumab in Pediatric Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia
To find the recommended dose of ziftomenib in combination with gemtuzumab ozogamicin and venetoclax that can be given to pediatric participants who have relapsed or refractory AML or MPAL.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Venetoclax|DRUG: Gemtuzumab|DRUG: Ziftomenib
Safety and adverse events (AEs), Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, Through study completion; an average of 1 year
Primary Objectives:

- To determine the safety, tolerability, and recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of ziftomenib in combination with gemtuzumab ozogamicin and venetoclax for pediatric participants with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

Secondary Objectives:

* To determine the preliminary assessment of efficacy by overall response (OR), including complete remission (CR), CR with incomplete blood count recovery and partial remission, overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS) and duration of response (DOR) of pediatric participants treated with this combination.
* To determine time to first response and time to best response of pediatric participants treated with this combination.

Exploratory Objective

- To evaluate molecular and cellular markers that may be predictive of antitumor activity and/or resistance.
