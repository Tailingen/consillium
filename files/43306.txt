A Study of AK109 Combined With AK104 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a multi-center, open label, phase Ib/II clinical study of AK109 and AK104 to evaluate the safety, tolerability, effectiveness, pharmacokinetic characteristics in advanced solid tumors .
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: AK109+AK104
Number of subjects experiencing dose-limiting toxicities(DLTs), DLTs will be assessed during the first 21 days of treatment and are defined as toxicities that meet pre-defined severity criteria, and assessed as having a suspected relationship to study drug, and unrelated to disease, disease progression, inter-current illness, or concomitant medications., Up to 21 days|Incidences and severity of AE, An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment., Up to 2 years|Objective response rate (ORR), The ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects with CR or PR, based on RECIST Version 1.1., Up to 2 years
Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of first dosing till the first documentation of disease progression (per RECIST v1.1) or death from any cause (whichever occurs first), Up to 2 years|Disease control rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the proportion of subjects with CR, PR, or SD, based on RECIST v1.1, Up to 2 years|Duration of response (DoR), Duration of response is defined as the duration from the first documentation of objective response to the first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 2 years|Time to response (TTR), Time to response (TTR) is defined as the time from the start of the treatment to the first objective tumor response observed for patients who achieved CR or PR, as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1., Up to 2 years|Overall survival (OS), OS defined as the time from the first dose to death from any cause. Subjects who do not die at the end of the extended follow-up period, or were lost to follow-up during the study, were censored at the last date they were known to be alive., Up to 2 years|Correlation analysis of PD-L1 expression with efficacy, Characteristics of tumor tissue PD-L1 expression and exploratory analysis of correlation between PD-L1 expression status and efficacy., Up to 2 years
