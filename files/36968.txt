Carbon Dioxide Laser vs. Electrocoagulation for the Therapy of Condyloma
In a randomized clinical trial of 114 women undergoing Treatment for condyloma acuminata, two surgical methods, the carbon dioxide laser Ablation and the excision by electrocoagulation, will be compared. The primary outcome of the study is the cosmetic result judged by the Patient 6 weeks after Treatment using a 11-step visual analogue scale (VAS), secondary outcomes are intervention time, operative complications, subjects and users satisfaction, postoperative pain and recurrence of genital warts.
