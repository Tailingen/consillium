A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of A2B395, an Allogeneic Logic-gated CAR T, in Participants With Solid Tumors That Express EGFR and Have Lost HLA-A*02 Expression
The goal of this study is to test A2B395, an allogeneic logic-gated Tmod™ CAR T-cell product in subjects with solid tumors including colorectal cancer (CRC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and other solid tumors that express EGFR and have lost HLA-A\*02 expression.

The main questions this study aims to answer are:

* Phase 1: What is the recommended dose of A2B395 that is safe for patients
* Phase 2: Does the recommended dose of A2B395 kill the solid tumor cells and protect the patient's healthy cells

Participants will be required to perform study procedures and assessments, and will also receive the following study treatments:

* Enrollment in BASECAMP-1 (NCT04981119)
* Preconditioning lymphodepletion (PCLD) regimen
* A2B395 Tmod CAR T cells at the assigned dose

Phase 1: Rate of adverse events and dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) by dose level, Adverse events and toxicity will be evaluated according to the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 (or current version). Cytokine release syndrome (CRS), immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), and graft versus host disease (GvHD) events will be graded according to the criteria described in the current protocol., From the time of Informed consent until 24 months (2 years) post A2B395 infusion|Phase 1: Recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), The RP2D will be identified utilizing a BOIN study design in addition to considering safety and biomarker analysis., 28 days post A2B395 infusion|Phase 2: The overall response rate (ORR) for patients, The ORR will be evaluated per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 and assessed by independent central review., 24 months post A2B395 infusion
Persistence of A2B395, Number of A2B395 Tmod CAR T cells present in participants treated with A2B395 as assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (or similar method) on participant blood samples, up to 24 months post A2B395 infusion|Cytokine analysis, Cytokine levels such as interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) in participants treated with A2B395 assessed by cytokine analysis on participant blood samples, up to 24 months post A2B395 infusion|Cytokine analysis, Cytokine levels such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) in participants treated with A2B395 assessed by cytokine analysis on participant blood samples, up to 24 months post A2B395 infusion
This is a seamless phase 1/2, multi-center, open-label study that enrolls adults with recurrent unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic (considered non-curative) CRC, NSCLC, HNSCC, TNBC, RCC, or other solid tumors with EGFR expression. Subjects must be germline HLA-A\*02 heterozygous, with tumors that express EGFR and have lost HLA-A\*02 expression. The purpose of Phase 1 of this study is to determine the safety and the optimal dose of A2B395 (after PCLD) in participants with solid tumor disease. The purpose of Phase 2 of this study is to determine the further safety and efficacy (how well it treats the solid tumor disease) of A2B395.

The treatment available for these cancers and other solid tumors can be toxic, debilitating, and fatal. In the recurrent unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic setting, the intent of standard of care treatment is typically palliative rather than curative, and has not changed significantly in several decades. A2 Bio hypothesizes that A2B395 Tmod CAR T-cell therapy will enable the killing of tumor target cells (those cells that express EGFR and have loss of heterozygosity \[LOH\] for the HLA-A\*02 protein). Additionally, normal healthy cells that maintain HLA-A\*02 expression and co-express EGFR (eg, skin tissue) will not be targeted due to the blocker portion of the Tmod CAR T cell that acts as a self-regulated safety switch that protects normal tissue from damage. Furthermore, the blocker portion of the Tmod CAR T cell will act as a safety switch to protect normal tissue from graft versus host disease (GvHD) that could be caused by an allogeneic CAR T cell. A2 Bio intends this to provide a wider therapeutic safety window compared to previous solid tumor targeting therapies. This hypothesis will be explored in the study.

Participants for this study must enroll and have confirmation of LOH in the pre-screening BASECAMP-1 study (NCT04981119). Upon disease progression the participant may screen for this study (DENALI-1). There is no time requirement between the studies, and patients may go directly from BASECAMP-1 to DENALI-1 based on their own disease course.
