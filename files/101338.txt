A Phase 1/2A Study of LAM561 in Adult Patients With Advanced Solid Tumours
This is a phase 1/2A, open label, non-randomized study in patients with advanced solid tumours including malignant glioma
Glioma|Other Solid Tumours
DRUG: LAM561
Number of patients with adverse events, All adverse events will be recorded including clinically significant physical examinations and vital signs, laboratory safety tests and 12-lead electrocardiograms, From the first dose of study drug until 30 days after the last dose of study drug
Concentration of LAM561 in blood measured by LC-MS/MS, Full profiles on Day 1 and Day 21 (dose escalation phase only), trough measurements on Day 8, 15 and 21, 21 days|Concentration of biomarkers in blood or tumour tissue, Effect on glial fibrillary acidic protein in glioma patients and effect on sphingomyelin and dihydrofolate reductase in patients with other solid tumours, First 22 days then every 9 cycles until any criterion for discontinuation is met (clinical or radiological progression of disease, clinically unacceptable toxicity, or another "general" discontinuation criterion)|Concentration of micro RNA in blood, Blood samples for future analysis of micro RNA, First 22 days then every 9 cycles until any criterion for discontinuation is met (clinical or radiological progression of disease, clinically unacceptable toxicity, or another "general" discontinuation criterion)|Radiological disease progression, Measurement by CT or MRI scan. Changes scored according to Response Assessment in Neuro-oncology (RANO) criteria (for glioma patients) or Response evaluation criteria in solid tumours (RECIST v1.1) (for other solid tumour patients)., Every 6 weeks until any criterion for discontinuation is met (clinical or radiological progression of disease, clinically unacceptable toxicity, or another "general" discontinuation criterion)|Clinical disease progression, until any criterion for discontinuation is met (clinical or radiological progression of disease, clinically unacceptable toxicity, or another "general" discontinuation criterion
This is an open label, non-randomized study in patients with advanced solid tumours including malignant glioma. The study will be performed in two phases - a dose escalation phase following a standard "3+3" design to establish dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and a safe dose of LAM561 followed by two expanded safety cohorts (approximately 10 of whom have malignant glioma and approximately 10 of whom have other advanced solid tumours that are suitable for biopsy) treated at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). If the MTD is well tolerated in the expanded safety cohorts, that dose becomes the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). During each dose cohort, at least one week must elapse between the first and subsequent patients receiving treatment with LAM561. Patients may receive palliative localized radiotherapy, if needed (however, this lesion cannot be a target lesion for evaluation of the treatment response).

Safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics and efficacy will be evaluated during the study at pre-defined timepoints
