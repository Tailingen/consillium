A Randomized Controlled Clinical Study on the Application of the Third Space in the Operation of Gastric Submucosal Tumor
Gastric submucosal tumors (SMTs) are rare findings during routine upper endoscopy; the incidence of these lesions may be as high as 0.4%.SMTs display a wide spectrum,ranging from benign to highly malignant, with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) being the most common type.SMTs is a gastrointestinal tumor,surgical operation is still the main method of gastric tumor treatment.The common surgical methods for resection of SMTs include laparotomy and laparoscopic surgery.In recent years, the Da Vinci robot assisted gastric resection has become a new way to treat gastric cancer. Compared with the traditional laparoscopy and laparotomy, the operation of the robot is more precise and flexible, with obvious advantages of minimally invasive and good application value and prospect.In recent years, some scholars have put forward the concept of the third space.The concept of the "third space" was initiatively proposed at the same time when new endoscopic surgery approach via natural orifice transluminal was put forward(NOTES). To be specific, with respect to the first space(lumen) and second space(peritoneal cavity),the third space refers to the intramural space.The aim of the study is to compare value (outcomes/costs) of surgery in patients with SMTs by 2 approaches:Laparoscopic and Endoscopic cooperative surgery(LECS),Robotic and Endoscopic cooperative surgery(RECS).First of all, the investigators will collect 80 cases of SMTs patients, randomly assigned for the LECS and RECS groups. Secondly, to analyzing the demographic data,basic treatment and follow-up data, including the operation time, blood loss, the number of cut edge positive, the distances of cut edge away from the tumor edge, average such confinement, the meal time, cost of treatment, tumor recurrence rate, the presence of residual stomach, upset stomach and frequency,complications and other indicators.
Gastric Submucosal Tumors
PROCEDURE: Laparoscopy endoscopy cooperated surgery|PROCEDURE: Dan Vinchi robot endoscopy cooperated surgery
operation time, record in minutes,from the beginning of anesthesia to the end, 1 hours to 6 hours through the surgery completion
blood loss, from the surgical record sheet, 1 hours to 6 hours through the surgery completion|success rate, to ensure the integrity of the tumor and obtain the negative surgical margin, from two days to two weeks after surgery|time in bed, the time in bed to the postoperative patient, from two days to two weeks after surgery|time to take food, the time to eat to the postoperative patient, from two days to two weeks after surgery|postoperative complication rate, including anastomotic stoma fistula,anastomotic stenosis,abdominal infection,postoperative bleeding, from two weeks to one year after surgery|tumor recurrence rate, periodic review the CT or MRI or endoscope, from one month to 2 years after surgery|hospitalization expenses, total hospitalization expenses, 1 month
