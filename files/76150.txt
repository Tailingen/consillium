Study of Acupuncture to Control Weight and Improve Pregnancy Rates in Overweight/Obese PCOS Patients
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common cause of anovulatory infertility and is characterized by ovulatory dysfunction, increased androgens, and polycystic ovaries. The goal of this randomized control study is to compare the efficacy between acupuncture and metformin both with intensive lifestyle intervention for overweight /obese PCOS patients in weight and pregnancy rates improvement.

the level of body fat distribution, Compared with the baseline in two groups, the level of body fat distribution to evaluate weight control outcome, up to 8 weeks|Pregnancy rates after intervention, Compared with the baseline in two groups, pregnancy rate is one of the index to evaluate reproductive outcome, up to 1 year|Body mass index, Compared with the baseline in two groups, the level of body mass index to evaluate weight control outcome., up to 8 weeks
Standardized TCM syndrome differentiation and classification of PCOS patients, Through the "tongue and pulse image, meridians, and constitution identification collection analyzer" (registration certificate number: Ji Machinery Note 20202200354), the standardized TCM syndrome differentiation and classification of PCOS patients was clarified., up to 8 weeks|Glucose metabolism, the area under the curve (AUC insulin), fasting insulin, glucose, computational homeostatic model assessment (HOMA)-IR and HOMA-B (i.e., isis Î² cell function) were calculated during the insulin-to-glucose tolerance test (OGTT), up to 8 weeks|Female menstrual pattern, Sex hormones, anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) and 21-day progesterone measurement, up to 8 weeks|Intestinal bacteria microbiota, Such measurement is tested through gene and microbiota testing. Those who have taken antibiotics and live bacteria within one week are excluded., up to 8 weeks
A randomized control study is designed to compare the efficacy of acupuncture and metformin with intensive lifestyle intervention for overweight /obese PCOS patients in weight and pregnancy rate improvement. 92 patients will be enrolled from Renji Hospital affiliated with Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine and will be divided into 2 groups: acupuncture+ intensive lifestyle intervention group and metformin + intensive lifestyle intervention group. Each group used a specific treatment (shown as the group name) for 8 weeks. In this study, the role of acupuncture in improving weight control and pregnancy rate in overweight/obese PCOS patients will be evaluated, the safety and efficacy of acupuncture as well as metabolic measurements. Molecular targets and models for predicting the sensitivity and prognosis of acupuncture treatment, as well as in-depth research on the molecular mechanism of acupuncture in treating PCOS, have a guiding significance and promote the modernization of traditional medicine.
