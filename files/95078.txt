A Study to Examine the Safety and Toleration of PEP005 Topical Gel in Patients With Actinic Keratoses on the Top of the Hand
The purpose of this study is to examine the safety and toleration of PEP005 Topical Gel, administered on an actinic keratosis (AK) treatment area on the top of a hand.
Actinic Keratosis
DRUG: PEP005 gel
Incidence of Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs); and Local Skin Responses (LSR), 57 days
The complete clearance rate of AK lesions; partial clearance rate of AK lesions and baseline clearance rate of AK lesions., 57 days
Actinic keratoses (AK) is a common skin condition characterized by rough, scaly patches or sores on the top layer of the skin which if left untreated can progress to skin cancer. Current treatments can cause scarring and hypopigmentation, be inconvenient, or require long treatment duration. Non-invasive alternative therapy for treatment of AK lesions is thus being researched.
