"Studying The Role of Key Epigenetic Mediators in Breast Cancer Patients"
The role of epigenetic regulators and their dysregulation in cancer have gained much attention recently, as they influence the gene expression of many oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) including (lncRNAs and miRNAs) and chromatin remodeling machinery proteins are key epigenetic regulators playing a key role in carcinogenesis. In addition, they can serve as diagnostic and prognostic markers in many cancer types including breast cancer. Therefore, studying these molecular markers will help in the diagnosis and prognosis as well as in the better understanding of this devastating disease.To the best of our knowledge, This is the first research work measuring the expression level of UPK1A-AS1 and/or UNC5B-AS1 in breast cancer clinical samples.

These data could provide a promising approach in introducing a novel markers that help in the diagnosis and prognosis of breast cancer and provide a potential targets for gene therapy.

Breast cancer is considered as one of the most frequent malignancies in women worldwide and one of the leading cause of death among women globally. Even with remarkable advances in diagnosis and therapy, the prognosis of breast cancer patients remains disappointing\[1\]\[2\]. Breast cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease that is classified into four subtypes based on the expression of certain hormonal receptors as estrogen receptor ER, progesterone receptor PR and human epidermal growth factor receptor HER2\[2\]. The following are the four subtypes of breast cancer: Luminal A tumors are characterized by the presence of ER and/or PR and the absence of HER2, Luminal B tumors are of higher grade and worse prognosis compared to Luminal A, they are ER positive and can be PR negative and have a high expression of Ki67 (greater than 20%), the HER2-positive group constitutes 10-15% of breast cancers and is characterized by high HER2 expression with absence of ER and PR and Triple-negative breast cancer which lack the expression of the previous three receptors\[3\]\[4\].

Epigenetics regulation of gene expression is the alteration in gene expression function without changing the nucleotide sequence. Both activation and inactivation of cancer-associated genes can occur by epigenetic mechanisms. The major players in epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation are DNA methylation, histone modification, chromatin remodelers , and noncoding RNA expression\[5\].

Histone modifications are one of the important regulators of chromatin structure which is very crucial for gene expression as it defines accessibility of DNA for transcriptional regulators, affects gene expression, and influences vital cellular processes \[6\].

Histone modifications can recruit transcription factors, chromatin remodelers, and chromatin structural proteins so contribute to the formation and maintenance of active or repressive chromatin state\[6\]. The most important histone modifications are: lysine acetylation, lysine and arginine methylation, serine/threonine/tyrosine phosphorylation, and serine/threonine ubiquitylation \[6\]. Many of histone modification enzymes are frequently mutated in different types of cancer by example: EHMT2 (G9A) encodes a methyltransferase that methylates lysine residues of histone H3, Methylation of H3 at lysine 9 by this protein results in recruitment of additional epigenetic regulators and repression of transcription. The histone methyltransferase G9a is well-documented for its implication in neoplastic growth\[7\]. Another example on histone modification enzymes is KMT5B (SUV420H1) a methyl transferase enzyme that catalyzes the deposition of H4k20me mark, a repressive mark and is believed to have a tumor suppressor role in many cancer types\[8\].

The chromatin structure can also be regulated by chromatin remodelers' complexes, they are four conserved families of ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers in mammals (CHD), (ISWI), (INO80), and (SWI/SNF), and are involved in most essential cell processes \[9\].

Chromatin modification machinery is highly dysregulated in cancers including breast cancer by example: mutations or inactivation of genes encoding subunits of the SWI/SNF complex are found in approximately 20% of cancers\[10\].

Another important epigenetic mechanism is the effect of non-coding RNAs on gene expression.

Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are a heterogeneous group of transcripts that are not translated into proteins. They have emerged as important regulators of multiple biological functions, and their dysregulation has been implicated in diseases including cancer. They have gained a huge interest among the scientific community due to their use as disease biomarkers. There are many types of ncRNAs including miRNAs and lncRNAs\[11\].

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, highly conserved non-coding RNA molecules (18-25) nucleotides involved in the regulation of gene expression. Accumulating studies have identified that microRNAs (miRNAs) are novel regulators acting as tumor suppressors or oncogenes in tumor progression\[12\]. It was reported that exosomal miR-138-5p exerts an oncogenic function in breast cancer patients via inhibiting KDM6B protein\[13\]. Peng Bian MD et al reported that The expression of miR-4306 was reported to be downregulated in breast cancer tissues if compared to adjacent tissues\[14\].

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are another type of non-coding RNAs that are more than 200 nucleotides in length and most of them are not translated into proteins\[15\]. In spite of the fact that most lncRNAs are not translated, they have gained huge interest in research due to their regulatory functions on gene expression of other target genes\[15\]. LncRNAs regulate gene expression at the epigenetic, transcriptional, post-transcriptional, translational, and post-translational levels by interacting with mRNA, DNA, protein, and miRNA\[16\]. Additionally, they have a crucial role in maintaining biological processes as histone modification, chromatin remodeling, transcriptional interference, transcriptional activation, mRNA translation and RNA processing\[16\]. Recently it was stated that lncRNAs are involved in many cancers as lung cancer, liver cancer, prostate cancer, bladder cancer and breast cancer\[2\] so, they can be used as a novel biomarker and pharmaceutical target in cancer therapy \[17\]. For example, the oncogenic lncRNA PVT1 promotes the proliferation of breast cancer cell via miR-181a-2-3p/ESR1 axis \[18\]. Importantly, lncRNAs can have a crosstalk with chromatin modifying and remodeling complexes to tightly regulate many normal cellular pathways as well as carcinogenic pathways. They can regulate the chromatin modification machinery whether by direct interaction or indirectly via sponging certain miRNAs. Example on direct interaction in cancer: LncRNA UCA1 regulates chromatin remodeling via binding with SMARCA4 to impair its binding to its region on p21 promoter which leads to bladder cancer proliferation\[19\]. Example on indirect interaction in cancer: LncRNA-MIAT promotes thyroid cancer progression and function as ceRNA to target EZH2 by sponging miR-150-5p\[20\].

LncRNAs can be detected in plasma/serum so function as non-invasive biomarker\[21\].

LncRNA UPK1A-AS1 is a newly identified biomarker in cancer. It was reported that, it has an oncogenic role in pancreatic cancer via conferring platinum resistance through double strand break repair\[22\]. Moreover, it was stated that UPK1A-AS1 promoted the proliferation of HCC by interacting with EZH2\[23\]. Despite the fact that lncRNA UPK1A-AS1 was reported to be oncogenic in HCC, pancreatic cancer and lung cancer cell lines, it was believed that it has a tumor suppressor role in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells cancer via sponging miR-1248\[24\]\[25\].

LncRNA UNC5B-AS1 has been recognized as an oncogene in thyroid cancer, prostate cancer and HCC\[26\] \[27\]. It also was stated that it has oncogenic role in ovarian cancer via regulating histone modification\[28\].

However, the role of lncRNAs UPK1A-AS1 and UNC5B-AS1 in the pathogenesis of breast cancer patients haven't been revealed yet.

1.2. Problem Definition. In Egypt, breast cancer is the most common malignancy among females with most of the cases being diagnosed at a late stage with poor prognosis\[29\]. Approximately 46,000 incident cases are forecasted in 2050. Although the incidence rate in Egypt is lower than the global figures., the mortality rate is much higher if compared with the developed countries by approximately 2 folds (41% v 23%) \[30\]. So, providing novel markers for breast cancer diagnosis and/or prognosis as well as understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying their link with carcinogenesis remains a challenge in management and treatment of breast cancer.

1.3. Hypothesis. As the problem statement is to provide novel markers that haven't been studied in breast cancer patients before to help in the diagnosis and prognosis of this aggressive disease. Accordingly, in the present study we will investigate the role of long non-coding RNAs UPK1A-AS1 and/or UNC5B-AS1 as possible diagnostic and/or prognostic markers in breast cancer. In addition, the possible crosstalk and correlation between these long non coding RNAs and chromatin modification enzymes and/or remodeling complexes as KMT5B and G9A via sponging certain target miRNAs as mir-138-5p and mir-4306 will be investigated. 2.
