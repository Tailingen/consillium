A Phase 2 Trial of Almonertinib With Concurrent Radiotherapy in The Treatment of Local Advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC
Previous clinical studies showed there is a potential value of EGFR-TKI in local advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC, while the risk of radiation pneumonia in combination of EGFR-TKI with thoracic radiotherapy is unknown. This study aims to explore the safety and efficacy of concurrent almonertinib, a new third-generation EGFR-TKI drug, with radiotherapy in local advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer|Stage III NSCLC|EGFR Activating Mutation
DRUG: Almonertinib
RP(≥3), incidence of radiation pneumonitis (≥ grade 3) within 6 month after Radiotherapy, 6 months
LCR, local control rate, 1 years|PFS, progression-free survival (PFS) defines as intervals from treatment to disease progression or death, 2 years|OS, overall survival (OS) intervals from treatment to death or last follow-uo, 2 years
Doublet platinum-based therapy combined with radiotherapy remains the standard treatment for first-line management of unresectable stage III NSCLC patients, regardless of the EGFR mutation status. But the 5-year survival rate is not satisfying. Previous clinical studies showed there is a potential value but also a high risk of radiation pneumonia in treatment regimens of combination TKI with radiotherapy. This study intends to explore the safety and efficacy of concurrent almonertinib, a new third-generation EGFR-TKI drug, with radiotherapy in EGFR-sensitive mutated locally advanced NSCLC patients.
