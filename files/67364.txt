First in Human Study of IMGN151 in Recurrent Gynaecological Cancers
IIMGN151-1001 is a Phase 1, first in human, open-label dose-escalation, optimization, and expansion study designed to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, and preliminary antitumor activity of IMGN151 in adult participants with recurrent endometrial cancer; recurrent, high-grade serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers; or recurrent cervical cancers. All participants will be, in the opinion of the investigator, appropriate for nonplatinum single-agent therapy for their next line of therapy.

Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of IMGN151, Up to approximately 3 years|Time to Reach Cmax (Tmax) of IMGN151, Up to approximately 3 years|Area Under the Curve From Time 0 to Infinity (AUC0-inf) of IMGN151, Up to approximately 3 years|Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Anti-drug Antibodies (ADAs), Up to approximately 3 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with best response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as assessed by the investigator per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 criteria., Up to approximately 3 years|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from initial response (CR or PR) until radiological progressive disease (PD), as assessed by the investigator, or death, whichever occurs first per RECIST v1.1 criteria., Up to approximately 3 years
Participants may continue on study drug based on clinical benefit until disease progression, adverse event (AE) requiring discontinuation, withdrawal of consent, physician decision, or other discontinuation criteria are met.
