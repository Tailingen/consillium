Clinical Study of ssCART-19 Cells in Patients With CD19 Positive Relapsed or Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
This is a single arm, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation, phase I study to determine the safety and efficacy of ssCART-19 in the treatment of patients with CD19 positive relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

This is a single arm, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation, phase I study to determine the safety and efficacy of ssCART-19 in the treatment of patients with CD19 positive relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Primary objectives:

Determine the safety and tolerability of ssCART-19 cells in patients with refractory or relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Secondary objectives:

1. Observe the anti-tumor response of ssCART-19 cells to refractory or relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

   * Overall remission rate (ORR) assessment during the 3 months after ssCART-19 administrationï¼ŒORR includes CR and CRi
   * Duration of response (DOR)
   * Progression-free survival (PFS)
   * Overall survival (OS)
2. To characterize the in vivo cellular pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of ssCART-19 cells.
3. To characterize the pharmacodynamic (PD) profile of ssCART-19 cells.
