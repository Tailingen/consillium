Ferric Derisomaltose and Outcomes in the Recovery of Gynecologic Oncology: ERAS (Enhanced Recovery After Surgery)
Iron deficiency has been reported in approximately 35% of patients with a gynecologic malignancy. Blood transfusions are known to be immunosuppressive and carry immediate and long-term risks. Pre-operative blood transfusion in gynecologic oncology patients is associated with higher rates of surgical site infection, length of stay, composite morbidity, cancer recurrence, and mortality. Pre-operative intravenous iron formulations have been shown in benign gynecology and other surgical specialities to increase pre-operative hemoglobin and decrease post-operative transfusion rates.

This is a randomized double-blinded clinical trial evaluating the effects of treating patients undergoing gynecologic oncology surgery with intravenous ferric derisomaltose to correct pre-operative iron-deficiency anemia.

The study aims to assess the effectiveness of preoperative ferric derisomaltose/iron isomaltoside compared to placebo in correcting preoperative hemoglobin in patients undergoing surgery for gynecologic malignancy.

Mean preoperative haemoglobin concentration, To determine the effect of IV iron supplementation provided at least 21 days prior to surgery for gynecologic malignancy on mean preoperative haemoglobin concentration (in g/L)in patients with iron deficiency anemia compared to those patients without preoperative IV iron supplementation., Haemoglobin concentration will be measured at baseline and 3 days prior to surgery after treatment with Ferric Derisomaltose
Mean haemoglobin concentration at the time of surgery, The effect of IV iron supplementation provided prior to surgery for gynecologic malignancy on mean haemoglobin concentration (in g/L) at the time of surgery., Haemoglobin concentration will be measured at baseline and at the time of surgery after treatment with Ferric Derisomaltose|Mean postoperative haemoglobin concentration, The effect of IV iron supplementation provided prior to surgery for gynecologic malignancy on mean hemoglobin concentration after the completion of surgery which will be assessed by measuring blood hemoglobin levels, Haemoglobin concentration will be measured at 28 and 60 days after surgery|Assessment of the requirement of postoperative blood transfusion, The number of participants requiring blood transfusion after completion of gynecologic surgery. A blood transfusion event is defined as receiving any volume of one unit or more than one unit of packed red cells or whole blood., Day 0 to 28 days following surgery|Mean number of blood transfusions, The mean number of blood transfusion (total number of units of packed red blood cells transfused ) after completion of gynecologic surgery, Day 0 to 28 days following surgery|Postoperative Quality of Recovery(QoR)-15 questionnaire score, Quality of life will be evaluated using Quality of Recovery(QoR)-15 questionnaire score at postoperative day 1 compared to baseline (minimum value : 0, maximum value : 150, the higher the score, the better the result), Post-operation day 1 (24 hours Â± 12 hours following surgery)|Mean Change in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia (FACT-An) Scores, The FACT-An questionnaire is a 47-item, cancer specific questionnaire consisting of a core 27 items measuring 4 general domains physical well being (PWG), social/family (SWB), emotional well being (EWB) and Functional Well-Being (FWB) and an additional 20-item anemia questionnaire that measures fatigue associated items and 7 non-fatigue items. The scales are formatted on 1 to 4 pages for self-administration using a 5-point Likert rating scale (0 = Not at all; 1 = A little bit; 2 = Somewhat; 3 = Quite a Bit and 4 = Very much). Also, general health related quality of life (HRQoL), the FACT-An measures the impact of fatigue and other anemia-related symptoms on patient functioning and is used to assess the effect of treatments in various therapeutic areas, including MDS., Baseline to 0-3 days prior to surgery and at 23-33 days postoperative|Mean Change in Quality of life measured with the EQ5D5L (European Quality of Life Five Dimension) scores, Health-related quality of life will be measured using the EuroQol Five Dimensions (EQ-5D). The EQ-5D-5L is a valid extension of the 3-level questionnaire. It can be defined as a standardized non-disease specific value-based instrument to describe and value health-related quality of life. The instrument consists of two components: the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS).The first part consists of five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has five response categories (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems), from which a single EQ-5D index score can be calculated ranging from 0 (dead) to 1 (perfect health). The EQ-VAS measures one's self-perceived health today on a vertical scale from 0 (worst imaginable health) to 100 (best imaginable health) on which participants have to indicate their current health., Baseline to 0-3 days prior to surgery and at 23-33 days postoperative|Mean Change in Quality of life measured with the SF-36 scores, The SF-36 is a 36-item survey of health and well-being. The scale consists of eight domains: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning and mental health.

Minimum Value: 0 (worst outcome) Maximum Value: 100 (best outcome), Baseline to 0-3 days prior to surgery and at 23-33 days postoperative|Clinical surgical site infection, Rate of participants presenting with clinical surgical site infection will be measured post-operation., within 28 days following surgery|Clinical surgical complications, Proportion of participants experiencing any complication post-operatively, within 28 days following surgery|Postoperative length of hospital stay, Mean and median length of stay (in days) in hospital following surgery, From Surgery date up to 60 days post surgery|Rate of hospital readmission, Proportion of participants requiring re-admission to hospital following surgery after initial discharge, from discharge date to 28 days post surgery
