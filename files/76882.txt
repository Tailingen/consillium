CD34+ (Malignant) Stem Cell Selection for Patients Receiving Allogenic Stem Cell Transplant
The purpose of this study is to learn more about the effects of (classification determinant) CD34+ stem cell selection on graft versus host disease (GVHD) in children, adolescents, and young adults. CD34+ stem cells are the cells that make all the types of blood cells in the body. GVHD is a condition that results from a reaction of transplanted donor T-lymphocytes (a kind of white blood cell) against the recipient's body and organs. Study subjects will be offered treatment involving the use of the CliniMACSÂ® Reagent System (Miltenyi Biotec), a CD34+ selection device to remove T-cells from a peripheral blood stem cell transplant in order to decrease the risk of acute and chronic GVHD.

This study involves subjects who are diagnosed with a malignant disease, that has either failed standard therapy or is unlikely to be cured with standard non-transplant therapy, who will receive a peripheral blood stem cell transplant. A malignant disease includes the following: Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) in chronic phase, accelerated phase or blast crisis; Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML); Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS); Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia (JMML); Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL); or Lymphoma (Hodgkin's and Non-Hodgkin's).

Incidence of acute GVHD, Acute GVHD will be assessed and graded with standard NCI grading criteria.Evaluated daily while hospitalized, then weekly (1-60 days post-transplant), as clinically indicated (60-365 days post transplant), then 1 year, 1.5 years, 2 years and yearly (366+ days post-transplant), Up to 2 years post-transplant
Time to neutrophil engraftment, Will be assessed multiple times while hospitalized, 1-60 days post transplant, 100 days post-transplant, 180 days post-transplant, and 1-year post transplant. Neutrophil engraftment is defined as the first of three days following the neutrophil nadir with an absolute neutrophil count above 500/mm3., Up to 1 year post-transplant|Time to immune reconstitution, Immune reconstitution studies will be conducted (For T-cell, B-cell, natural killer (NK)-cell and immunoglobulins) 60 days post-transplant, 100 days post-transplant, 150 days post-transplant, 180 days post-transplant, 270 days post-transplant, 1-year post-transplant, and 2 years post transplant., Up to 2 years post-transplant|Incidence of infection complications including bacterial, viral, fungal and atypical mycobacterial and other infections, Will be assessed weekly or more as indicated until 84 or 100 days post-transplant, then as clinically indicated., Up to 100 days post-transplant|Time to platelet engraftment, Will be assessed multiple times while hospitalized, 1-60 days post transplant, 100 days post-transplant, 180 days post-transplant, and 1-year post transplant., Up to 1 year post-transplant|Incidence of chronic GVHD, Chronic GVHD will be assessed and graded with standard NCI grading criteria., Up to 2 years post-transplant|Severity of acute GVHD, Acute GVHD will be assessed and graded with standard NCI grading criteria., Up to 2 years post-transplant|Severity of chronic GVHD, Chronic GVHD will be assessed and graded with standard NCI grading criteria. Evaluated daily while hospitalized, then weekly (1-60 days post-transplant), as clinically indicated (60-365 days post transplant), then 1 year, 1.5 years, 2, Up to 2 years post-transplant|Incidence of primary graft failure, Primary graft rejection is defined as the presence of \< 20% donor cells, 42 (or more) days post-transplant|Incidence of secondary graft failure, The presence of \< 20% donor derived hematopoietic cells in peripheral blood, 42 (or more) days post-transplant
Graft versus host disease (GVHD) is one of the serious complications following allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The incidence and severity of GVHD increase with the degree of HLA incompatibility between the host and donor. The most reliable way to prevent acute and chronic GVHD is to remove T cells from the graft. However, the incidence of graft failure increases with the efficiency of T cell depletion and low T cell numbers are predictive of graft failure. Immunomagnetic selection of HLA-mismatched CD34+ progenitor cells has demonstrated high levels of T cell depletion and successful engraftment in adult and pediatric patients with the malignant and nonmalignant disease.
