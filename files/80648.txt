Lymphedema After Urologic Surgery
Lymphedema of the extremities is common after lymph node surgery in treating several forms of cancer, e.g., breast cancer. However, very little is known of the occurrence of lymphedema of the lower extremities after urologic surgery with lymph node dissection. This project aims to describe the frequency and grade of lymphedema arising after urologic surgery, using the Lymphedema Quality of Life Questionnaire (LymQOL), Delfin MoistureMeter D, and lower limb volume measurements.
