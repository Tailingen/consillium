PRevention Using EPA Against coloREctal Cancer
This research study is evaluating the effect of AMR101 as a possible chemopreventive agent to reduce risk of colorectal cancer in individuals with a history of colorectal adenoma.

- The name of the study drug involved in this study is:

-- AMR101 (VASCEPA).
Colorectal Adenoma|Colorectal Cancer|Endoscopic Surgery|Eicosapentaenoic Acid|Gastrointestinal Microbiome
DRUG: AMR101
Change in the Marine Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid (MO3PUFA) Composition in Colorectal Tissues as a Result of the AMR101 Treatment., Measured using the extraction of fatty acid with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry from the biopsy tissue., 8-12 weeks
Change in the Gut Microbiome Composition, Measured using shotgun metagenomic sequencing of microbial DNA on pre- and post-treatment stool samples.

The reported results represent the Shannon Diversity Index, which is a quantitative measure that reflects how many different bacterial species there are in a sample. The index's values range from 0 to 5, but usually range from 1.5 to 3.5. The greater the index, the more diverse the gut microbiota. A negative change indicates a decrease in diversity and a positive change indicates an increase in diversity.

We used the vegan R package to conduct the analysis., 8-12 weeks 8-12 weeks 8-12 weeks 8-12 weeks|Change in Fecal Metabolite Levels (Butyrate), Butyrate is the metabolite of our most interest for the current study, based on the prior data suggesting that marine omega-3 fatty acid may increase the production of butyrate by bacterial fermentation of dietary fiber.

The metabolites were measured by the non-targeted global metabolomic panel. The measurement represents the abundance (assessed as weight percentage of density) of a metabolite after total-signal normalization to account for varying water weight across stool samples., 8-12 weeks
This prospective, single-arm, research study evaluating the effect of AMR101, as a chemopreventive agent to reduce risk of colorectal cancer in individuals with a history of colorectal adenoma.

* AMR101 is made of marine omega-3 fatty acid, which is a family of natural substances found in the oil of certain fish, such as salmon and mackerel. Marine omega-3 fatty acid cannot be produced in sufficient amount by the human body and has to be obtained through diet or supplemented to maintain normal function in the body.
* The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved AMR101 as a treatment for any disease.
* AMR101 is commercially available in the US as VASCEPA (icosapent ethyl)
* The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including evaluations and follow up visits, including:

  * Lifestyle questionnaire,
  * Nutritional survey
  * Flexible sigmoidoscopy (24 biopsies of normal colorectal mucosa, one stool sample)
  * Blood samples,
* AMR101 administered daily, orally for 8-12 weeks and it is expected 80 participants will take part.
