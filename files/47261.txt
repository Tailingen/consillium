Postmastecomy Internal Mammary Nodal Irradiation for High-risk Breast Cancer Patients
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of internal mammary nodal irradiation on disease-free survival in high-risk breast cancer patients treated with mastectomy.
Breast Cancer
RADIATION: internal mammary nodal irradiation|RADIATION: no internal mammary nodal irradiation
disease-free survival, failure: relapse of ipsilateral chest wall, axilla, supraclavicular and internal mammary nodal or distant metastasis or contralateral invasive breast cancer or death due to any cause., 5 years

Eligible patients are randomized into 2 groups: chest wall and supraclavicular nodal +-axillary plus internal mammary nodal irradiation, and chest wall and supraclavicular nodal +-axillary nodal irradiation. The prescription dose is 50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks or 43.5Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks.

During and after radiotherapy, the patients are followed and the efficacy and toxicities of radiotherapy are evaluated.
