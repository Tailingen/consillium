Phase I Study of P276-00 in Patients With Advanced Refractory Neoplasms
P276-00 is a molecule derived from Rohitukine, which through pre clinical assays was identified as a selective Cdk4-D1 and Cdk1-B inhibitor.The inhibition of these Cdks causes cell cycle arrest between the G1-S transition thus blocking the cell cycle events at an early stage of development. It therefore has the potential for being efficacious with lesser side effects.
