Seroma Formation After Modified Radical Mastectomy With Flap Fixation Technique in Breast Cancer Patients
The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of mastectomy flap fixation in breast cancer patients. The main questions it aims to answer are:

- To compare seroma formation after mastectomy flap fixation with conventional surgery in breast cancer patients Participants will be randomly divided into 2 groups,

1. Mastectomy flap fixation
2. Conventional surgery with non flap fixation. Researchers will record the amount and color of drainage fluid, patient and tumor characteristics, and operative related factor after surgery.

Researchers will compare with conventional surgery to see if seroma formation, and wound infection.
Breast-cancer
PROCEDURE: Flap fixation technique
Seroma formation, Collection of acute inflammatory exudates in response to surgical trauma and acute phase of wound healing., Every day for 7 days after operation, after discharge 7 days, 15 days, 21 days, 42 days, 63 days, 84 days
Wound infection, Any clinical signs and symptoms of wound infection, redness , swelling, wound dehiscence, of Fever \> 38 C, Every day for 7 days after operation, after discharge 7 days, 15 days, 21 days, 42 days, 63 days, 84 days
Seroma is collection of blood plasma or lymphatic fluid under skin flap or axillary dead space. It occurred after modified radical mastectomy. Patient will have subcutaneous swelling or edema which be confirmed by physical examination or bedside ultrasound. It categorized by common terminology criteria for adverse events version 5.0 for 3 grades.

1. asymptomatic
2. symptomatic with medical intervention or simple aspiration
3. symptomatic with required interventional radiology or operative intervention.
