Placebo-Controlled Therapeutic Trial for the Prevention of Lymphedema
This randomized clinical trial studies an investigational drug in preventing lymphedema in patients at high risk after undergoing axillary lymph node dissection. The study drug may prevent lymphedema in patients undergoing axillary lymph node dissection.
Lymphedema|Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific
DRUG: placebo for study drug|DRUG: (RS)2-(3-benzoylphenyl)-propionic acid|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis
Number of Participants With Incidence of Lymphedema, Participants were evaluated every 3 months up to one year post lymph node dissection, Up to 1 year
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate the efficacy of study drug in improving chronic lymphedema while further elucidating the role of inflammatory and lymphangiogenic processes in the pathogenesis of this disease.

OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

ARM I: Patients receive study drug orally (PO) thrice daily (TID) for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO TID for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years.
