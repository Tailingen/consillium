Study of Carotuximab (TRC105) Plus Nivolumab in Patients With Metastatic NSCLC
This is a multi-center, open-label, nonrandomized, dose-escalation, Phase 1b study of carotuximab in combination with standard dose nivolumab in patients with NSCLC that has progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy or PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibition, as a single agent or with chemotherapy.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
DRUG: Carotuximab (TRC105)|DRUG: OPDIVO
Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), For DLT evaluation, severity (grade) was classified according to common terminology criteria for adverse events version 4.03 (CTCAE v4.03). DLTs were defined as grade 4 neutropenia persisting for ≥ 5 days, Febrile neutropenia: Grade 4 neutropenia with fever \>38.5ºC both sustained over a ≥24-hour period, neutropenic infection (grade ≥ 3 neutropenia with grade ≥ 3 infection), anemia ≥ grade 4, Grade ≥4 thrombocytopenia or Grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia with Grade ≥3 hemorrhage, or grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicity with the following exceptions: asymptomatic electrolyte abnormality that is corrected to Grade 1 or better in \<72 hours, grade 3 headache lasting \<48 hours. See protocol for Immune related DLT criteria., Approximately 2-8 months
Response Rate, Preliminary evidence of antitumor activity of carotuximab (TRC105) plus nivolumab will be evaluated, by assessing response rate and progression-free survival. The best response was measured to iRECIST by MRI or CT scans for each patient with measurable disease who received at least 1 dose of study drug., Approximately 2-8 months|Trough Carotuximab (TRC105) Concentrations, Trough (pre-dose) serum carotuximab (TRC105) concentrations will be measured using validated ELISA methods., 8 weeks|Development of Immunogenicity Antibodies, Number of Participants with carotuximab (TRC105) anti-product antibodies (APA), Approximately 2-8 months|Trough Nivolumab Concentrations, Trough (pre-dose) serum nivolumab concentrations will be measured using validated ELISA methods., Approximately 2-8 months
