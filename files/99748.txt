A Drug Interaction Study to Assess the Effect of LY2603618 on the Metabolic Pathway of Desipramine
The purpose of this study is to assess the effect LY2603618 on a protein \[enzyme cytochrome P (CYP) 2D6\] which is involved in the metabolic pathway of Desipramine in participants with cancer. This is a drug interaction study so the treatment of the disease will not be the main purpose of the study.

The study involves two single doses of 50 milligrams (mg), 1 tablet by mouth, on Day 1 of Period 1 and 2. In Period 1 Desipramine will be administered alone. In Period 2 Desipramine will be administered in combination with LY2603618. LY2603618 will be administered as a 275mg intravenous (IV) infusion over 1 hour (hr).

Desipramine will be administered at the end of the LY2603618 infusion. Information about any side effects that may occur will also be collected.

Number of Participants With a Tumor Response, Tumor response is complete response (CR) + partial response (PR), as classified by the investigators according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria (Version 1.1). CR is the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and PR is a ≥30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions. Number of participants with a tumor response is the total number of participants with CR or PR., Baseline to study completion up to 11 cycles of 21-day cycles
