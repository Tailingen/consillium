A Study of Apalutamide in Chinese Participants With Non Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (NM-CRPC)
The purpose of this study is to compare the improvement in time to prostate specific antigen (PSA) progression (TTPP, as defined by Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 \[PCWG2\]) of apalutamide versus placebo in Chinese participants with high-risk non-metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (NM-CRPC).
Prostatic Neoplasms
DRUG: Apalutamide|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Androgen-deprivation Therapy (ADT)
Time to Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Progression (TTPP) Based on Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 (PCWG2) Criteria, Time to prostate specific antigen progression (TTPP) was defined as the time from randomization to the first date of documented PSA progression based on PCWG2 criteria. PCWG2 was defined as the PSA progression as 1) the date that a 25 percent (%) or greater increase and an absolute increase of 2 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) or more from the Nadir was documented, which was confirmed by a second value obtained 3 or more weeks later. 2) Where no decline from baseline was documented as a 25% increase from the baseline value along with an increase in absolute value of 2 ng/mL or more after 12 week of treatment. Kaplan-Meier method was used for the analysis., From randomization until first documented PSA progression (up to 3 years 3 months)
Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Treatment-emergent Serious Adverse Events (TESAEs), Up to 6 years 4 months|Number of Participants With Grade 3 or Higher Abnormalities in Laboratory Values, Up to 6 years 4 months|Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Response (>=50% PSA Reduction), Up to 6 years 4 months|Plasma Concentration of Apalutamide and Its Metabolite (N-desmethyl Apalutamide), Presdose: Day 1 of Cycles 1, 2, 3, and 6; 2 hours postdose: Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 3
