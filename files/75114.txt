Reduced IV Fluids to Improve Clearance of HDMTX in Children w/Lymphoma or Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
To determine whether a reduced volume hydration regimen will lead to a shorter time to methotrexate clearance when compared to a standard intravenous (IV) hydration regimen.

DRUG: Intravenous fluids
Time elapsed (in hours) from end of HDMTX to a serum methotrexate level <0.1 micromol/L, To determine whether a reduced volume hydration regimen will lead to a shorter time to methotrexate clearance when compared to a standard IV hydration regimen by measuring serum methotrexate levels twenty-four hours following the end of the high dose methotrexate ( HDMTX) infusion, and continuing every twelve hours until the methotrexate level is less than 0.1 micromol/L., 63 Days
Markers of kidney toxicity, To determine the effect of a reduced volume hydration regimen on markers of kidney toxicity (nephrotoxicity) by evaluating serum creatinine levels from baseline levels as well as the maximum decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) utilizing the modified Schwartz equation, following each HDMTX cycle., 84 Days|Markers of fluid overload, To determine the effect of a reduced volume hydration regimen on markers of fluid overload by evaluating maximum weight gain during each hospitalization, and by evaluating the incidence of NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version v5.0 ≥ grade 1 clinical sequelae of hydration such as facial edema, pulmonary edema, abdominal distension, extremity edema, and weight gain., 84 Days|Effects on therapy delays, To examine the effects of a reduced volume hydration regimen on treatment schedule by measuring the number of days subsequent therapy is delayed for reasons other than scheduling issues or preferences., 84 Days|Effects on development of severe mucositis, To examine the effects of a reduced volume hydration regimen on development of severe mucositis by measuring the incidence of grade ≥ 3 (CTCAE v5.0) mucositis., 84 Days
This study uses a prospective randomized controlled crossover study design. Neither patients nor clinicians are blinded to the standard versus reduced intravenous fluids (IVF) regimen. Patients are randomized to begin with standard volume or reduced volume IVF. Over the course of 4 cycles of High Dose Methotrexate (HDMTX), patients alternate between standard and reduced volume post hydration fluids protocols.
