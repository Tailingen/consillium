Azacitidine in Treating Patients With Triple Negative Stage I-IV Invasive Breast Cancer That Can Be Removed By Surgery
This clinical trial studies azacitidine in treating patients with triple negative stage I-IV invasive breast cancer that can be removed by surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as azacitidine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

Percent of participants with ER/PR response after receiving 10 doses of 5-Azacitidine, 6 months after enrollment of last patient
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the ability of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation inhibition using 5-azacitidine to induce expression of the estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) genes in solid human triple negative invasive breast cancer. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the effect of systemic 5-azacitidine therapy on the expression of other methylated genes in triple negative invasive breast cancer using an Illumina GoldenGate array. OUTLINE: Patients receive azacitidine intravenously (IV) over 10-40 minutes 5 days a week for 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo definitive breast surgery within 12 days of the last dose of azacitidine.
