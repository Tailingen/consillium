Tislelizumab Combined With Chemotherapy Versus Chemotherapy Alone in Recurrent or Metastatic Nasopharyngeal Cancer (NPC)
This study was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of tislelizumab (BGB-A317) combined with gemcitabine plus cisplatin versus placebo combined with gemcitabine plus cisplatin as first-line treatment for recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal cancer.
Recurrent or Metastatic Nasopharyngeal Cancer
DRUG: Tislelizumab|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Cisplatin
Progression-free Survival as Assessed by the Independent Review Committee (IRC), Defined as the time from randomization to the first objectively documented disease progression, or death from any cause, whichever occurred first, as assessed by the IRC per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. Kaplan-Meier methodology was used to estimate the median PFS., Through the study interim data analysis cutoff date of March 26th, 2021 (maximum time on study follow-up was 23 months)
Overall Response Rate (ORR) as Assessed by the IRC, Defined as the percentage of participants who had complete response or partial response as assessed by the IRC per RECIST v1.1 in all randomized participants with measurable disease at Baseline., Through the study interim data analysis cutoff date of March 26th, 2021 (maximum time on study follow-up was 23 months)|Duration of Response (DOR) as Assessed by the IRC, Defined as the time from the first occurrence of a documented objective response to the time of relapse, or death from any cause, whichever occurred first, as assessed by the IRC per RECIST v1.1 in all randomized participants with documented objective responses., Through the study interim data analysis cutoff date of March 26th, 2021 (maximum time on study follow-up was 23 months)|Overall Survival (OS) as Assessed by the IRC, Defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause., Through study completion data cut-off date of December 8th, 2023 or last available date showing participants alive (maximum time on study follow-up was 53 months)|PFS as Assessed by the Investigator, Defined as the time from randomization to the first objectively documented disease progression, or death from any cause, whichever occurred first, as assessed by the investigator per RECIST v1.1., Through the interim analysis data cut-off date of March 26th, 2021 (up to approximately 23 months)|Progression-free Survival After Next Line of Treatment (PFS2) as Assessed by the Investigator, Defined as the time from randomization to second/subsequent disease progression after initiation of new anticancer therapy, or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. Median PFS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method., Through the study completion data cut-off date of December 8th, 2023 (maximum time on study follow-up was 53 months)|Change From Baseline in European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) Global Health Status, Change from baseline in EORTC QLQ-C30 Global Health Status/Quality of Life score. The EORTC QLQ-C30 v3.0 is a questionnaire that assesses quality of life of participants with cancer. It includes global health status and quality of life questions related to overall health in which participants respond based on a 7-point scale, where 1 is very poor and 7 is excellent. Raw scores are transformed into a 0 to 100 scale via linear transformation. A higher score indicates better health outcomes., Baseline to Cycle 6 (Each cycle is 21 days)|Change From Baseline in European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Head and Neck-351 (EORTC QLQ-H&N35) Index Score, The QLQ-H\&N35 consists of thirty-five questions that are associated with eighteen symptom scales (pain, swallowing, senses, speech, social eating, social contact, sexuality, problem with teeth, problem opening mouth, dry mouth, problem with sense smell, cough, felt ill, pain med, nutritional supplements, feeding tube, weight loss and weight gain).. Raw scores are transformed into a 0 to 100 scale via linear transformation. The index score is calculated as an average of the 18 symptom scales. A negative change from baseline score indicates improvement in symptoms., Baseline to Cycle 6 (Each cycle is 21 days)|Number of Participants With Adverse Events, Number of participants with treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), including laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and physical examinations (PEs ), graded according to the National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 5.0. For Arm B, only adverse events reported prior to participants crossing over to receive tislelizumab monotherapy are included., From first dose to 30 days after last dose or new anticancer therapy, or until Dec 8, 2023 data cut-off; max treatment duration: 231 weeks (Arm A), 202 weeks (Arm B).
