Impact of Acetazolamide in Reducing Referred Postoperative Pain
Robotic assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) is the standard treatment for prostate cancer, due to the benefits of decreased blood loss and length of stay.The procedure involves removing a man's prostate using a minimally invasive robotic approach under the guidance of a surgeon. In order to gain sufficient access, carbon dioxide (CO2) is used to fill the surgical space in a process termed insufflation. Carbon dioxide is a mainstay in laparoscopic procedures because it is cost-effective, noncombustible and readily excreted via the respiratory system in healthy patients.

Insufflation with CO2, however, has been linked to post-operative referred pain secondary to peritoneal acidosis.This acidosis is suspected to be due to the formation of carbonic acid from the CO2 insufflation.Peritoneal acidosis, and its associated post-operative referred pain, may not be adequately treated with the current standard pain control regimen.

Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) 10-cm lines anchored at the ends by words that define the bounds of various pain dimensions. The patient is asked to place a vertical mark on the scale to indicate the level of intensity of his pain., The primary outcome to be assessed is the absolute change in VAS score both in general and at the shoulder tip. This will be measured as the difference between the VAS score obtained pre-operatively, when first responsive after surgery in the post anesthesia care unit (PACU), immediately prior to leaving PACU, and throughout the hospital stay per standard of care.

Î” VAS = Postoperative VAS - Preoperative VAS VAS is a testing technique for measuring subjective or behavioral phenomena (as pain or dietary consumption) in which a subject selects from a gradient of alternatives (as from "no pain" to "worst imaginable pain" or from "every day" to "never") arranged in linear fashion -abbreviation VAS, 24 hours
