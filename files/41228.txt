Driver gene mutation frequency from CTCs of advanced NSCLC patients, Analyze the driver gene mutation frequency in CTCs from advanced NSCLC patients with tumor tissue driver gene mutation, 6 months|The gene mutation coincidence rate between CTCs and tumor tissue sample, Comparison the gene mutation coincidence rate between CTCs and tumor tissue sample, 6 months
Driver gene mutation frequency from ctDNA of advanced NSCLC patients, Analyze the driver gene mutation frequency in ctDNA from advanced NSCLC patients with tumor tissue driver gene mutation, 6 months|The gene mutation coincidence rate between CTCs and ctDNA, Comparison the gene mutation coincidence rate between CTCs and ctDNA, 6 months
1. Enrich CTCs from advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) patients with Driver gene mutation, and detect the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation, Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion, ROS proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase 1 (ROS1) fusion, RET proto-oncogene (RET) fusion and Mesenchymal-Epithelial Transition factor (MET) 14 exon skipping by Lung cancer Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) panel kit, and verify the mutation coincidence rate between CTCs and tumor tissue.
2. Enrich ctDNA from advanced NSCLC patients with Driver gene mutation, detect the EGFR mutation by PCR, and detect the ALK fusion, ROS1 fusion, RET fusion and MET 14 exon skipping by next generation sequencing (NGS), and compare the mutation coincidence rate between CTCs and ctDNA.
