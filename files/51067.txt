Early Specialized Cardiovascular Intervention Based on Impedance Cardiography in Locally Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Patients
This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, multi-center phase III clinical trial that intends to evaluate the role of early cardiovascular intervention based on impedance cardiography in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer receiving radical radiochemotherapy±immunotherapy.

This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, multi-center phase III clinical trial that intends to evaluate the role of early cardiovascular intervention based on impedance cardiography in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer receiving radical radiochemotherapy±immunotherapy. The participants were 1:1 randomized to the intervention group and the control group. The intervention group will receive cardiovascular evaluation and intervention at multiple timepoints throughout treatment and follow-up, while the control group will be under observation unless severe cardiovascular events happen.

The evaluation and intervention timepoints include: Before neoadjuvant therapy, before radiotherapy, Mid-radiotherapy, 2 months after the completion of radiotherapy, every 6 months thereafter for up to 2 years post-radiotherapy.
