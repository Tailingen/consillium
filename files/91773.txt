Efficacy of Two Antiemetic Regimens in Patients Receiving Radiotherapy and Concomitant Weekly Cisplatin
GAND-emesis is a multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of a neurokinin1 receptor antagonist (fosaprepitant dimeglumine) in combination with an antiemetic (anti-nausea-and-vomiting) control regimen (palonosetron and dexamethasone) in patients with a gynaecological cancer diagnosis, who are scheduled to receive radiotherapy and weekly chemotherapy.

The study aims at investigating if a three-drug antiemetic regimen is superior to a two-drug regimen (standard treatment) in preventing nausea and vomiting in patients receiving radiotherapy and weekly chemotherapy. A pilot study demonstrated that approximately 50% of patients will experience nausea and vomiting when offered a two-drug antiemetic regimen, and it is expected that addition of a third drug (a neurokinin1 receptor antagonist) can increase the proportion of patients with no vomiting in the course of combined chemo-radiotherapy.
