A Study to Assess the Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Effectiveness of AGS-16C3F Monotherapy in Subjects With Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) of Clear Cell or Papillary Histology
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics and assess the immunogenicity and effectiveness of AGS-16C3F in subjects with renal cell cancer (RCC).
Carcinoma, Renal Cell|Renal Cell Carcinoma of Papillary Histology|Renal Cell Carcinoma With Clear Cell Histology|Renal Cell Carcinoma With Non-Clear Cell Histology
DRUG: AGS-16C3F
Incidence of Adverse Events, 24 months
Pharmacokinetic profile for total antibody (TAb), antibody drug conjugate (ADC), and monomethyl auristatin F (MMAF): Ceoi or Cmax, Ctrough, Tmax, AUCτ, t1/2, CL, and Vss, Concentration at end of infusion (Ceoi) or maximum observed concentrations (Cmax), Trough concentration (Ctrough), time to maximum concentration (Tmax), partial area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUCτ), terminal or apparent half-life (t1/2), systemic clearance (CL), and volume of distribution at steady state (Vss), Days 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 15, 22, 43, 64, 65, 66, 67, 71, 78, and 92|Incidence of antidrug antibody formation to human native antibody (AGS-16C) and antibody drug conjugate (AGS-16C3F), 24 months|Tumor response: objective response rate, Determined from the subjects' best response and will include complete response (CR) and partial response (PR), 24 months|Tumor response: disease control rate, Determined from the subjects' best response will include complete response (CR) partial response (PR), and stable disease (SD), 24 months|Tumor response: Changes in bone scans, Baseline, Week 13 and every 12 weeks thereafter
The study has two components. The first aims to establish a safe dose for AGS-16C3F. Once identified, the safety and effectiveness will be tested in additional subjects with either clear cell or papillary histology in expanded cohorts.
