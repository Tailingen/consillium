Participants achieving CR, but with persistent morphologic bone marrow involvement or no bone marrow assessment post treatment were partial responders. Response includes confirmed CR/PR and unconfirmed CR/PR., From the first dose to approximately 2 to 3 weeks after 3 cycles of inotuzumab ozogamicin plus rituximab (induction) therapy (up to 12 weeks) and up to approximately 2 to 3 weeks after 6 cycles (up to 21 weeks).|Percentage of Participants With Successful G-CSF Mobilization of PBSC, Successful mobilization of PBSC was defined as ≥ 2 x 10\^6 CD34+ cells/kg collected after 3 cycles of inotuzumab ozogamicin plus rituximab therapy., From the first dose to approximately 2 to 3 weeks after up to 6 cycles of inotuzumab ozogamicin plus rituximab (induction) therapy (up to 21 weeks).|Percentage of Participants Who Underwent Autologous Stem Cell Transplant (aSCT), Participants underwent high dose chemotherapy and aSCT. In order to proceed to aSCT, participants were required to achieve CR or PR and successful collection of PSBC (≥ 2.0 x 10\^6 CD34+ cells/kg collected after 3 cycles)., A minimum of 4 weeks and a maximum of 8 weeks after the last cycle of inotuzumab ozogamicin plus rituximab (induction) therapy (up to 26 weeks).|Event-Free Survival (EFS) After aSCT, EFS was the time (in months) from the date of aSCT to the earliest date of progression, relapse after CR, death from any cause without progression, initiation of a new treatment for the lymphoma or was censored at the date of the last tumor assessment., From the completion of aSCT through 2 year long-term follow-up period, including but not limited to planned assessments scheduled every 3 to 6 months.|Percentage of Participants With a CR After 3 Cycles of Inotuzumab Ozogamicin Plus Rituximab Therapy, CR: complete disappearance of all detectable clinical \& radiographic evidence of disease \& disease-related symptoms; lymph nodes \& nodal masses regressed to normal size (≤ 1.5 cm in their greatest transverse diameter for nodes \> 1.5 cm before therapy); spleen and other organs (if enlarged prior to therapy) regressed in size \& spleen not palpable on physical examination; repeat bone marrow infiltrate clear. Response includes confirmed CR and unconfirmed CR., From the first dose to approximately 2 to 3 weeks after 3 cycles of inotuzumab ozogamicin plus rituximab (induction) therapy (up to 12 weeks).|Overall Survival (OS), OS was the time (in months) from the date of randomization to the date of death, and censored at the date of last contact if no death occurred., From randomization until the date of death, or the date of last contact if no death occurred (up to 2 years).|Percentage of Participants With Any Grade 3/4 Laboratory Abnormality During Therapy, The following parameters were analyzed for serum chemistry; blood urea nitrogen (or urea), creatinine, glucose, calcium, sodium, potassium, phosphorus, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin (and direct bilirubin, if total bilirubin was elevated), alkaline phosphatase, uric acid (or urate), albumin and total protein. The following parameters were analyzed for hematology; lymphocytes, basophils, eosinophils, erythrocytes, hematocrit, hemoglobin, leukocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, platelets, prothrombin international normalized ratio, prothrombin time, fibrinogen, and activated partial thromboplastin time. Laboratory test results were graded using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0 (CTCAE v3.0)., Within 3 days prior each dose of test article, on Day -2, 1, 8, and 15 of Cycles 1 to 3, 2 to 3 weeks after Cycle 3, at the end-of-treatment visit, and every 3 to 6 months during long-term follow-up (up to 2 years).|Percentage of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) During Inotuzumab Ozogamicin Plus Rituximab Treatment, An AE was any untoward, undesired, or unplanned event in the form of signs, symptoms, disease, or laboratory/physiologic observations occurring in a participant given a test article or in a clinical study; the event may not necessarily have had a causal relationship with the treatment. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged in-patient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly; cancer. Treatment-emergent AEs were AEs that emerged after the first dose of the study treatment during the treatment period that were absent pre-treatment, or worsened during the treatment period relative to the pre-treatment state. The severity of all AEs was graded by the investigator using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for AE Version 3.0 (CTCAE v3.0)., Treatment emergent AEs were collected from time of first dose to end of trial visit (participants not undergoing consolidation treatment) or until consolidation therapy. SAEs were collected from informed consent until end of trial visit (up to 6 months).
