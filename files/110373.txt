Combination Study of Deferasirox and Erythropoietin in Patients With Low- and Int-1-risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome.
The primary purpose of this trial was is to assess the effect of treatment with deferasirox combined with erythropoietin vs. erythropoietin alone on erythropoiesis in patients with low- and int-1-risk myelodysplastic syndrome. The addition of deferasirox to erythropoietin can lead to a potential synergism with the reduction of reactive oxygen species, through both the NF-kB pathway and the control of free toxic iron. This may create a better environment in the bone marrow for a better response with erythropoietin.

This study was designed to test in a prospective way the combination of deferasirox with erythropoietin in terms of their effect on hematopoiesis.

Difference in Percentage of Patients Achieving Erythroid Response Within 12 Weeks, by Treatment Group (Full Analysis Set), Difference in percentage of patients achieving an erythroid response within 12 weeks of treatment between the two arms according to modified IWG 2006 criteria increase in hemoglobin (Hb) ≥ 1.5 g/dL. Erythroid response is defined as the increase in Hb from baseline ≥ 1.5 g/dL. Patients achieving erythroid response at least once within 12 weeks were considered responders, Baseline up to 12 weeks

Percentages are based on N. Confidence intervals are calculated using Clopper-Pearson method. Hemoglobin value is at time of first response, baseline up to 24 weeks|Absolute Change in Serum Ferritin up to 24 Weeks for Erythropoietin Alpha Arm (Full Analysis Set), Absolute change in serum ferritin from baseline, Baseline up to 24 weeks|Absolute Change in Serum Ferritin up to 24 Weeks for Deferasirox + Erythropoietin Alpha Arm (Full Analysis Set), Absolute change in serum ferritin from baseline, Baseline up to 24 weeks|Absolute Change in Serum Ferritin up to 24 Weeks for EPO+DFX at 12 Weeks Arm (Full Analysis Set), Absolute change in serum ferritin from baseline, Baseline up 24 weeks|Absolute Change in Hemoglobin (Hb) From Baseline for Erythropoietin Alpha Arm (Full Analysis Set), This analysis included patients randomized either to EPO or DFX+EPO at baseline as well as patients who did not have erythroid response at week 12 in the EPO group and switched to combination therapy., Baseline up to 24 weeks|Absolute Change in Hemoglobin (Hb) From Baseline for Deferasirox + Erythropoietin Alpha Arm (Full Analysis Set), This analysis included patients randomized either to EPO or DFX+EPO at baseline as well as patients who did not have erythroid response at week 12 in the EPO group and switched to combination therapy., Baseline up to 24 weeks|Absolute Change in Hemoglobin (Hb) From Baseline for EPO+DFX at 12 Weeks Arm (Full Analysis Set), This analysis included patients randomized either to EPO or DFX+EPO at baseline as well as patients who did not have erythroid response at week 12 in the EPO group and switched to combination therapy. The time-course of Hb and its absolute changes from baseline was summarized by descriptive statistics by visit and erythroid response. Patients randomized to EPO and not switching after 12 weeks to EPO+DFX would consist of only responders., Baseline up to 24 weeks
This study did not meet the original enrollment objective of 60 patients and was terminated without extending enrollment past original planned LPFV of 31-Oct-2016.
