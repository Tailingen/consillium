Study of SXL01 in Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (PROSTIRNA)
This is a single site, open-label, non-randomized, dose escalation phase I study designed to evaluate the safety, the tolerability and the Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) of SXL01, a synthetic small interfering ribonucleic acid (RNA) targeting the androgen receptor messenger RNA (mRNA), in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

A standard method "3+3" will be used for dose escalation. A maximum of 30 patients will complete the dose-escalation phase of the study; 12 additional patients will be included at the RP2D in the expansion phase.
