Effects of Preoperative Enteral Immunonutrition for Esophageal Cancer Patients Given Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy
This randomized controlled trial will evaluate the effects of preoperative enteral immunonutrition in esophageal cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy. The purpose of this study is to determine whether preoperative immune-modulating diet before surgery can improve the rate of complications and other perioperative outcomes.

Minimal residual disease (MRD), Studies suggest that MRD monitoring through circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) can predict whether a patient has achieved pCR after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, thereby evaluating the efficacy of the treatment. Therefore, in order to explore whether enteral immunonutrition influences the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, we added the exploratory endpoint of MRD detection., Before and after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, 7-14 days after surgery|Microbiomics analysis, By collecting fecal samples before and after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and utilizing metagenomic sequencing, we aim to investigate the impact of enteral immunonutrition on the gut microbiome distribution in patients with esophageal cancer., 1 week before neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, 2-3 days before surgery|Metabolomic analysis, By collecting peripheral blood samples before and after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and utilizing mass spectrometry, we aim to investigate the impact of enteral immunonutrition on the metabolomic distribution in patients with esophageal cancer., 1 week before neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, 2-3 days before surgery
Esophageal cancer ranks the fourth in mortality and the sixth in incidence among cancers in China according to the latest report of cancer epidemiology. Although the development of neoadjuvant therapy and radical esophagectomy have improved the prognosis of esophageal cancer patients, dysphagia and digestive tract reconstruction can cause malnutrition and infection-related complications. Postoperative enteral and parenteral nutrition have proved to be effective in improving outcomes after esophagectomy. However, whether to provide a preoperative nutritional support for patients with resectable esophageal cancer remains controversial.

This prospective randomized controlled trial will evaluate the effects of preoperative enteral immunonutrition in esophageal cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy. The purpose of this study is to determine whether preoperative immune-modulating diet before surgery can improve the rate of complications and other perioperative outcomes.

The sample size is estimated with the hypothesis that preoperative immunonutrition during the neoadjuvant therapy can reduce postoperative nutrition and immune-related complications after esophagectomy. According to the previously published articles, the required sample size of interventional and control arm (ratio=2:1) was calculated as 137 cases and 69 cases to detect the reduction in related complications from 50% to 30% based on a bilateral significance level (α) of 0.05 and a power of test (1-β) of 0.80. Considering an estimated drop rate of 15%, the minimum sample size of this study is 244 patients, 162 cases in the interventional group and 82 in the control group. After signing the informed consent, every eligible participant will be randomized into either group based on a computer-generated random number. Blinding will not be applied to patients and surgeons due to the difficulty in clinical practice but outcomes assessor will be masked.
