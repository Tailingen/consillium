A Phase I/II Study of OPN-305 in Second-line Lower Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome
The dose-confirming part of this study, comprising at least 10 patients is designed as a single center, prospective, single arm, open label in patients who have failed or are unresponsive to Azacitidine (AZA) or Decitabine (they may also have additionally failed an Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agent (ESA) followed by a dose expansion part with at least 44 patients; the objective of the whole study being to assess the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of intravenously infused multiple doses of OPN-305 in low and intermediate-1 risk myelodysplastic syndrome (second and third line Lower risk MDS).
Myelodysplastic Syndrome
DRUG: OPN-305
Establishment of the dose and dose frequency based on dose-limiting toxicity and bone marrow receptor occupancy of OPN-305 in low and intermediate -1 (Lower) risk MDS, 8 weeks|Tolerability of OPN-305 as monotherapy based on adverse events, 16 weeks/32 weeks (if there is no AZA add-back)|Tolerability of OPN-305 as monotherapy and in combination with AZA based on adverse events, 32 weeks
Hematological response based on International Working Group (IWG) 2000/2006, week 36|Cytokine levels in serum (TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IL-18, IL-23 and IFN-γ), day 1 and week 4|Immunogenicity of OPN-305 (Measurement of anti drug antibodies and neutralizing antibodies), day 1, weeks 4, 8, 16, 24 and 32|Incidence of infections, 36 weeks|Pharmacokinetic profile of OPN-305 (maximum concentration (Cmax)), day 1, weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32|Pharmacokinetic profile of OPN-305 (time at which Cmax is attained (tmax)), day 1, weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32|OPN-305 receptor occupancy in peripheral monocytes, bone marrow cells and stroma, screening (bone marrow only), day 1 (blood only), wks 4 (blood only), 8, 12 (blood only), 16, 20 (blood only), 24 (blood only), 28 (blood only), 32 and 36 (blood only)|Correlation of clinical response with cytogenical observations, wk 36|Quality of life MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) - Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)/Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) questionnaire, MDASI is MD Anderson symptom inventory. It has two scales

1. Severity of symptoms scale 0-10 with 0 being not present and 10 being as bad as you can imagine
2. How symptoms interfere with life scale 0-10 with 0 did not interfere and 10 interfere completely, wk 36
