TriNav Infusion System for the Evaluation of Fidelity Between 99mTc-MAA and Y90-Microspheres Hepatic Distribution for Dosimetry Treatment Planning
To learn if using the TriNav Infusion System (TriNav catheter) for the injection of the surrogate/test dose during the planning part of the radioembolization procedure and your actual treatment with the radioactive microspheres match each other better than the standard catheter.
Liver Cancer
DEVICE: TriSalus™ TriNav™Infusion System|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Angiogram|PROCEDURE: Y90-radioembolization procedure
Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, Through study completion; an average of 1 year.
Primary Objectives:

To determine the percentage of tumors that demonstrate quantitative mean dose concordance (within 20%) using voxel-level quantitative SPECT/CT between 99mTc-MAA treatment planning to post therapy Y90 microspheres with an FDA-cleared Pressure Enabled Drug DeliveryTM (PEDDTM) device.

Secondary Objectives:

To determine the correlation of T:N ratios of all tumors 3cm based on 99mTc-MAA SPECT/CT and Y90 SPECT/CT imaging.

To determine the fidelity and concordance of perfused normal liver uptake and distribution between 99mTc-MAA treatment planning to post therapy Y90 microspheres SPECT/CT.

To assess safety of TriNav catheter in this study population
