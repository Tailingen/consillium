Comparison of Three Methods for Early Detection of Breast Cancer
Subjects with suspicious breast lesion (BIRADS category 4/5) who are scheduled to undergo biopsy will be recruited to undergo imaging evaluation with Contrast Enhanced Dual Energy Mammography (CEDM), Contrast Enhanced Breast MR (CEMR) and Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS).
Proliferative Breast Disease
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Contrast Enhanced imaging|DRUG: Lumason
CEUS true positive diagnosis, The number of CEUS true positive diagnosis defined as suspicious enhancement/ mass corresponding to area of malignant pathology at the time of biopsy based on lesion biopsy recommendation from diagnostic mammogram., 1 year|CEUS false positive diagnosis, The number of CEUS false positive diagnosis defined as suspicious enhancement corresponding to area of benign pathology at the time of biopsy based on lesion biopsy recommendation from diagnostic mammogram, 1 year|CEUS true negative diagnosis, The number of CEUS true negative diagnosis defined as no enhancement corresponding to area of malignant pathology at the time of biopsy based on lesion biopsy recommendation from diagnostic mammogram., 1 year|CEUS false negative diagnosis, The number of CEUS false negative diagnosis defined as no enhancement corresponding to area of benign pathology at the time of biopsy based on lesion biopsy recommendation from diagnostic mammogram., 1 year
The co-primary endpoints are to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of CEUS relative to pathology determined diagnosis.

1. Positive predictive value of CEDM in detecting lesions seen on MR
2. Estimate the negative predictive value (TN/(TN+FN)) of CEUS as an adjunct.
3. Compare the frequency of recommendation of biopsy of MG±US vs MG±US plus CEUS as an adjunct based on BIRADS scores.
4. Comparison of background enhancement seen on CEUS with that seen on CEDM and CEMR.
