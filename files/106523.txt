Assessment of the Minimal Residual Disease in Ovarian Cancer From Circulating Tumor DNA and Immune Repertoire
To analyze the proportion of hereditary tumors in ovarian cancer patients in China, as well as the spectrum of variations; the ctDNA characteristics in patients with ovarian cancer; the correlation between the clonal status of mutations and therapy response; whether ctDNA detection can be used to predict the risk of ovarian cancer recurrence; and the characteristics of immune repertoire before and after treatment in patients with ovarian cancer.
Ovarian Cancer
The ctDNA characteristics in patients with ovarian cancer , the correlation between the clonal status of mutations and therapy response and whether ctDNA detection can be used to predict the risk of ovarian cancer recurrence., 2 years
The proportion of hereditary tumors in ovarian cancer patients in China, as well as the spectrum of variations and the characteristics of immune repertoire before and after treatment in patients with ovarian cancer., 1 years
100 OC cases with available matched tumor DNA and plasma will be collected. All patients will be treated according to clinical guidelines, and receive circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) liquid biopsy at the time of diagnosis, at mid treatment, at the end of treatment and during follow-up. The study will be ended when the patients have progressive disease (PD) or reach the longest follow-up time (2 years).
