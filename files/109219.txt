Study of Folic Acid, Calcium and Vitamin D in Preventing Colorectal Polyps and Colorectal Cancer
Folic acid (FA) and its derivatives (folate) which play a role in nucleotide synthesis and methylation reactions as well as calcium and vitamin D are assumed to be effective in the prevention of colorectal polyps and Colorectal cancer (CRC). The aim of this study is to investigate the roles of FA as well as calcium and vitamin D in the prevention of CRC.

The primary objective of this study is to investigate the incidence of colorectal adenoma (CRA) after Folic acid, calcium and vitamin D intervention., baseline and 3 years
the incidence of advanced colorectal adenoma (A-CRA) after Folic acid, calcium and vitamin D intervention., baseline and 3 years|changes in serum calcium, baseline and 3 years|changes in serum FA, baseline and 3 years|the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) after Folic acid, calcium and vitamin D intervention., baseline and 3 years|changes in clinical symptoms scores (positive immunochemical fecal occult blood test (iFOBT), diarrhea, or constipation et al), baseline and 3 years|differences in Histological types of CRA OR CRC, baseline and 3 years
Changes in routine blood count, urine and stool routine test, liver and kidney functions, baseline and 3 years
Colorectal cancer (CRC) affects approximately one million people each year with a five-year survival rate of 62% . Considerable interest has recently been focused on the relationship between the chemoprevention of colorectal polyps/CRA and CRC. Therefore, the use of nutritional compounds which are usually less afflicted with the risk of severe side effects for colorectal adenoma (CRA) prevention and health maintenance is an emerging field.
