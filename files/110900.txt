Efficacy and Safety of BCD-100 (Anti-PD-1) in Combination With Platinum-Based Chemotherapy With and Without Bevacizumab as First-Line Treatment of Subjects With Advanced Cervical Cancer (FERMATA)
This is a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, Phase 3 study of efficacy and safety of BCD-100 plus platinum-based chemotherapy with and without bevacizumab versus placebo plus platinum-based chemotherapy with and without bevacizumab

Overall Survival (OS), The time from the date of randomization until death, 3 years
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) per RECIST 1.1, The time from the date of randomization until progression of disease according to RECIST 1.1 criteria or death, 3 years|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) per iRECIST, The time from the date of randomization until progression of disease according to iRECIS criteria or death, 3 years|Overall Response Rate per (ORR) RECIST 1.1, The percentage of the participants who have a Complete Response or a Partial Response as assessed by a blind independent central reviewer per RECIST 1.1, 1 year|Overall Response Rate (ORR) per iRECIST, The percentage of the participants who have a Complete Response or a Partial Response as assessed by a blind independent central reviewer per iRECIST, 1 year|Disease Control Rate (DCR), The percentage of the participants who have a Complete Response, a Partial Response or a Stable DIsease as assessed by a blind independent central reviewer, 1 year|Time to Response (TTR), TTR will be calculated from the randomization date, 1 year|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR will be calculated from the moment of registration of response till event (progression or death), 1 year
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Test Regimen or Comparator Regimen as the first-line treatment for advanced cervical cancer. Subjects will receive study therapy Q3W until progression of the disease or signs of unacceptable toxicity. In the absence of dose-limiting toxicity chemotherapy should be continued for at least 6 cycles, then, upon Investigator's decision and/or subjects' wish, the use of chemotherapy can be stopped while maintenance therapy with BCD-100/Placebo with or without bevacizumab (depending on initial therapy choice) continues until disease progression.
