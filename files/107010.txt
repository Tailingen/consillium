A Safety Study of Carfilzomib, Cyclophosphamide & Dexamethasone Prior to ASCT in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Myeloma
This is a dose finding pilot study to evaluate the safety and determine the maximum tolerated dose of the combination of carfilzomib and cyclophosphamide with dexamethasone (Car-Cy-Dex) prior to autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) in patients with newly diagnosed transplant eligible multiple myeloma.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Carfilzomib|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Dexamethasone
Adverse Events as a measure of safety and tolerability, Review of adverse events for safety and to determine the maximum tolerated dose of the combination treatment., Throughout treatment, estimated to be 4-6 months per patients
Overall Response after induction therapy, Overall response (PR, VGPR, CR, sCR), Every 28 days during induction therapy, estimated to be 4-6 months|Overall Response post ASCT, Overall Response (PR, VGPR, CR, sCR) at 3 and 6 months post ASCT., 3 and 6 months post ASCT|Time to Progression, Time to progression will be noted if it occurs within 6 months post ASCT., Througout treatment and 3 and 6 months post ASCT|Progression Free Survival, up to 6 months post ASCT|Time to Next Therapy, Time to Next Therapy if occurs within 6 months post ASCT, up to 6 months post ASCT
This is a dose finding pilot study to evaluate the safety and determine the maximum tolerated dose of the combination of carfilzomib and cyclophosphamide with dexamethasone (Car-Cy-Dex) prior to autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) in patients with newly diagnosed transplant eligible multiple myeloma. The study will also explore the efficacy of Car-Cy-Dex including overall response after induction therapy, overall response at 3 and 6 months post ASCT, and time to progression, progression free survival, and time to next therapy if it occurs within 6 months post ASCT.
