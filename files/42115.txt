Cognitive Remediation Therapy for Brain Tumor Patients: Improving Working Memory
To investigate a computer-based Cognitive Remediation Therapy (CRT) for brain tumor patients at the Massey Cancer Center on measures of cognitive functioning (e.g., working memory, attention, processing speed, language, visuospatial functioning, immediate and delayed memory, or executive functioning) over time.

During these time points, the scores are measured on Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS)., Baseline to 6 months|Change in scores on Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS-Update A, B, C, or D) over time, Brief neuropsychological evaluations will be conducted at 4 time points (these assessments are standard of care). Baseline before the participant is introduced to the CogMed® training program, within 2 weeks of completion of the CogMed® program, at 3 months of completion of the CogMed® program to establish maintenance of gains, and at 6 months of completion of the CogMed® program to establish longer-term maintenance of gains. During these time points, the scores are measured on Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS-Update A, B, C, or D)., Baseline to 6 months|Scores on Test of Premorbid Functioning (TOPF) at baseline, Brief neuropsychological evaluations will be conducted at baseline before the participant is introduced to the CogMed® training program. During this time point, the scores are measured and compared on Test of Premorbid Functioning (TOPF) with other psychological measures., Baseline|Change in scores on Trial Making Test (TMT) over time, Brief neuropsychological evaluations will be conducted at 4 time points (these assessments are standard of care). Baseline before the participant is introduced to the CogMed® training program, within 2 weeks of completion of the CogMed® program, at 3 months of completion of the CogMed® program to establish maintenance of gains, and at 6 months of completion of the CogMed® program to establish longer-term maintenance of gains. During these time points, the scores are measured on Trial Making Test (TMT)., Baseline to 6 months|Change in scores on Wechsler Memory Scale - Fourth Edition (WMS-IV) over time, Brief neuropsychological evaluations will be conducted at 4 time points (these assessments are standard of care). Baseline before the participant is introduced to the CogMed® training program, within 2 weeks of completion of the CogMed® program, at 3 months of completion of the CogMed® program to establish maintenance of gains, and at 6 months of completion of the CogMed® program to establish longer-term maintenance of gains. During these time points, the scores are measured on Wechsler Memory Scale - Fourth Edition (WMS-IV)., Baseline to 6 months
Change in scores on Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) over time, Brief neuropsychological evaluations will be conducted at 4 time points (these assessments are standard of care). Baseline before the participant is introduced to the CogMed® training program, within 2 weeks of completion of the CogMed® program, at 3 months of completion of the CogMed® program to establish maintenance of gains, and at 6 months of completion of the CogMed® program to establish longer-term maintenance of gains. During these time points, the scores are measured on Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)., Baseline to 6 months|Change in scores on Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) over time, Brief neuropsychological evaluations will be conducted at 4 time points (these assessments are standard of care). Baseline before the participant is introduced to the CogMed® training program, within 2 weeks of completion of the CogMed® program, at 3 months of completion of the CogMed® program to establish maintenance of gains, and at 6 months of completion of the CogMed® program to establish longer-term maintenance of gains. During these time points, the scores are measured on Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II)., Baseline to 6 months
Participants will be recruited by their neuropsychologist in the VCU Massey Cancer Center following standard neuropsychological evaluation (their neuro-oncologist may refer them to this study). If meeting inclusion criteria (described in later sections on participants), participants will be recruited and enrolled in the study. Two groups will be formed: High grade gliomas (WHO grade III or IV; n=15) and Low grade gliomas (WHO grade II; n=15). Participants will be followed over 11 months. The two groups will follow identical study timelines.
