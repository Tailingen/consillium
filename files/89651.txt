Effects of Eicosapentaenoic Acid on Subjects at High Risk for Colorectal Cancer
The aim of this study is to test Eicosapentaenoic acid's effects on markers relevant to colorectal carcinogenesis, RNA and DNA profiles, and the possibility that Eicosapentaenoic Acid treatment might be associated with changes of the gut microbiota and metabolomic profiles in patients with long-standing ulcerative colitis.
