Virtual Surgical Planning Systems in Mandibular Reconstruction
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of virtual planning using customized surgical devices (VP3D) in fibula free flap mandibular reconstruction. Virtual planning was compared to postoperative scans using cephalometric and three-dimensional (3D) measurements. Operative times of both VP3D and conventional surgery groups were compared.
Mandibular Neoplasms
PROCEDURE: Virtual planning using customized surgical devices|PROCEDURE: Conventional surgery
Comparison of the cephalometrics measurements between the virtual model and postoperative outcomes, The virtual model obtained using preoperative surgical planning will be compared with postoperative outcomes derived from facial bone scans conducted on all VP3D group patients 6 months after surgery (MIMICS INNOVATION suite 2.1 software, MATERIALISE, Leuven, Belgium).

The cephalometrics measurements (in mm) between the virtual model and postoperative outcomes will be compared., Six months after surgery
