Phase I Study of Oral DFP-11207 in Solid Tumors
This is a first-in-human, open label, single arm, sequential dose escalation and expansion study of oral DFP-11207 in patients with advanced solid tumors.
Solid Tumors|Cancer
DRUG: Oral DFP-11207
To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of daily oral dosing of DFP-11207 in patients with solid tumors, The MTD and tolerability will be based on the incidence of adverse events and dose-limiting toxicities in patients. CTCAE 4.0 will be used to grade the severity of adverse events., Continuous starting on day of first dose (Day 1) up to 30 days after last dose|For food effect study: To assess PK profiles of DFP-11207 under fed and fasted conditions, Plasma concentration and time data of DFP-11207 metabolites for the food effect study will be determined., Cycle 1, Day 1: pre dose, 4, 10, 24, and 48 hrs post-dose; Day 14: 2, 10 and 24 hrs post-dose; Day 16: pre-dose, 4, 10, and 24 hrs post-dose; Day 18: pre-dose; Day 23: 2 hrs post-dose; Day 29: 2 and 24 hrs post-dose. Cycle 2, Day 1: pre-dose
Pharmacokinetics (PK): To measure plasma and urine concentrations of DFP-11207 and its metabolites, PK parameters to be measured include area under the concentration curve versus time (AUC) and maximum drug concentration (Cmax), Cycle 1, Day 1: 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 hours post-dose; and on Days 15 and 29|To determine preliminary efficacy (overall response rate) in solid tumor patients receiving oral DFP-11207, Response to treatment will be assessed per RECIST 1.1, Every 8 weeks (2 months)
The Phase I dose escalation portion of the study has been completed. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) has been determined. The study will now evaluate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of DFP-11207.

The food effect study is a two-step, two-way crossover design to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of oral DFP-11207 capsules. During Cycle 1, oral DFP-11207 capsules are to be taken daily (as a single dose or twice-daily \[approximately 12 hours apart\]) under fed/fasted conditions. After Cycle 1, the food effect study will be completed and patients will continue to take oral DFP-11207 capsules twice-daily (approximately 12 hours apart) for 28 days of a 28-day treatment cycle.
