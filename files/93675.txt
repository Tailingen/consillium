Cancer Screening Program for Women at High Risk for Developing Ovarian Cancer
The main purpose of this program is to see whether periodically measuring CA-125 (tumor marker) levels in the blood and undergoing transvaginal ultrasounds over time will be effective in the early detection of ovarian cancer.

Measuring for elevated levels of tumor marker CA-125 in the blood over time., Average expected time of 1 year
Performing transvaginal ultrasounds to look for any abnormalities over time., Criteria for an abnormal scan include 1) enlargement of one or both ovaries or 2) suspicious or indeterminate morphometric parameters, determined by the presence of intracystic papillations, and/or mural nodularity. Volume calculations will determine whether the ovary is enlarged., Average expected time of 1 year|Performing health status questionnaires over time, Average expected time of 1 year
The program will offer twice yearly CA-125 blood tests and annual transvaginal ultrasounds to monitor women at high risk for ovarian cancer. In addition to the main purpose of providing ovarian cancer screening, the researchers would also like to build a repository of blood specimens for use in ovarian and breast cancer research and to offer genetics counseling sessions to help educate women about risk-reducing options.
