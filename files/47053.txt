Preoperative 3D Models and Shared Decision-making
The objectives of this study will be to quantify, using validated scales, the effects of 3D-printed models on shared decision-making and patient anxiety during the pre-operative consent and education process.

Shared decision making, Quantify and compare patient perception of involvement in decision-making in either arm, measured by the validated Shared Decision Making (SDM-Q9) tool., Within 30 minutes after the preoperative counselling session.
Change in patient anxiety, Quantify and compare patient anxiety levels before and after the pre-operative consent, measured by the validated State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-6) among the study arms., Within 30 minutes before and 30 minutes after the preoperative counselling session.|Change in patient knowledge using a self-developed questionnaire, Using a self-developed questionnaire to quantify and compare patient knowledge of the essential aspects of anatomy, disease, and surgical procedure covered in preoperative counseling to understand how patient knowledge improves with counseling and compares between the study arms., Within 30 minutes before and 30 minutes after the preoperative counselling session.
In this single-center pilot cluster randomized controlled trial, the investigators will prospectively measure patient-reported outcomes on shared decision-making and change in anxiety and knowledge. This study will consist of two arms with at least 20 patients each. Six surgeons will be randomly assigned using the opaque sealed envelope method to counsel patients using a modular 3D-printed model or providing standard care during pre-operative clinic visits. The eligibility criteria for the control and investigational arms will be standardized. The biostatistician will use Student t-tests to compare mean scores and ANCOVA to compare the change in mean scores after the pre-operative clinic visit.
