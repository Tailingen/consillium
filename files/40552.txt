Preoperative i.v. Iron Substitution in Patients With Colon Cancer
About 70% of colon cancer patients are anemic. Preoperative anemia in patients with colorectal cancer is associated with both impaired disease-free survival and overall survival. The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of preoperative iv iron substitution on postoperative recovery in preoperatively anemic (male Hb \<130, female Hb \<120) and iron deficient colon cancer patients in a prospective setup. As a primary outcome, the effect of iv-iron substitution on postoperative complications is investigated.
