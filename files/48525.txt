Mitochondrial Oxygraphy on Subcutaneous and Peri-visceral Adipose Tissue: Influence of Body Composition
The objective of this study is to adapt the oxygraphy technique on human adipocytes and to characterize respiration measurements according to patients' body mass index and white adipose tissue localization (subcutaneous vs visceral).

During digestive surgery: oncological and bariatric surgery, it is possible to collect a small volume of subcutaneous and epiplonic adipose tissue (10-20 cc). We wish to collect these samples in order to develop the technique of oxygenography on permeabilized adipocytes. In order to characterize these measurements, they will be related to the clinical data of the patients usually collected in the framework of the preoperative assessment including the body mass index (BMI). The measured adipocyte data will thus be normalized to three BMI classes: ≤ 20, \> to 20 \< 30, and ≥ to 30 kg∙m-2.

Primary end point is to validate the measurement of mitochondrial respiration under oxidophosphorylating conditions by determining indicators of the distribution of mitochondrial respiration values (mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, coefficient of variation) as a function of patients' body mass index.
