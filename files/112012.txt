TNFerade Biologic to Treat Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer
While radiation therapy with androgen ablation (hormone reduction) is the standard method of treating locally advanced prostate cancer. New treatments are being combined with radiation therapy in an effort to further improve the cure rates.

This study proposes to combine an experimental drug, TNFerade™ Biologic, (also called AdGVEGR.TNF.11D or "TNFerade") at different dose (amounts) levels in combination with radiation.

TNFerade™ Biologic is a form of gene transfer therapy that when injected into the tumor has shown to increase the effect of radiation therapy.
