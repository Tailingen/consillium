A Multi-mode Thermophysical Immunotherapy Study for Breast Cancer Liver Metastases
This is a single-center, parallel-controlled clinical study designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy and impact on systemic anti-tumor immunity of a multi-mode integrated ablation system for the treatment of breast cancer liver metastases.

Anti-tumor immune response, The anti-tumor immune response refers to the effect and mechanism by which multi-mode ablation activates systemic persistent specific anti-tumor immunity, thereby inhibiting tumor metastasis and recurrence., max 24 months
6-Month Local Control Rate, 6-month local control rate (LCR) refers to the proportion of patients in whom the primary tumor site lesions are completely suppressed after treatment among all treated patients six months after the start of treatment., 6 months|6-Month Progression-Free Survival, 6-month progression-free survival (6-month PFS) refers to the percentage of patients who are alive without tumor progression or metastasis six months after the start of treatment., 6 months|1-Year Progression-Free Survival, 1-year progression-free survival (1-year PFS) refers to the percentage of patients who are alive without tumor progression or metastasis one year after the start of treatment., 1 year|1-Year Overall Survival, 1-year overall survival (1-year OS) refers to the percentage of patients who are still alive one year after the start of treatment., 1 year
This is a single-center, parallel-controlled clinical study. The study plans to enroll 10 subjects, with 5 in the multi-mode ablation group (experimental group) and 5 in the conventional radiofrequency ablation group (control group). The entire study includes a screening period, treatment period and follow-up period. By comparing multi-mode ablation with conventional radiofrequency ablation, the study aims to observe the efficacy, safety of the multi-mode ablation technique in subjects and its impact on the systemic anti-tumor immunity of subjects.
