Study of Onvansertib in Combination With FOLFIRI and Bevacizumab or FOLFOX and Bevacizumab Versus FOLFIRI and Bevacizumab or FOLFOX and Bevacizumab for First-Line Treatment of Metastatic Colorectal Cancer in Adult Participants With a KRAS or NRAS Mutation
The purpose of this study is to assess 2 different doses of onvansertib to select the lowest dose that is maximally effective, and to assess the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of onvansertib in combination with FOLFIRI + bevacizumab or FOLFOX + bevacizumab in patients with KRAS or NRAS-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) in the first-line setting.
