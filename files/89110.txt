GRWD5769 is as a potential new treatment for advanced or metastatic solid malignancies. GRWD5769 works by stopping an enzyme in the body, called endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1), from working. ERAP1 is part of how the body recognizes the presence of a cancer tumour and helps trigger the immune system to fight the cancer. However, in patients with cancer, the immune system cells can become exhausted and no longer work effectively. By blocking ERAP1 it makes the tumour look different to the immune system and so the immune system starts fighting the cancer again. GRWD5769 has the potential of producing clinically meaningful improvements in monotherapy and in combination with therapy like cemiplimab (Libtayo®) by enhancing the antitumour immune response.

Who can participate? Patients with advanced or metastatic solid malignancy aged 18 years or older.

What does the study involve? This study consists of Module 1 (Parts A to D), which will look at the effects of GRWD5769 when given alone and Module 2 (Parts A to C) which will look at the effects of GRWD5769 when given in combination with another anticancer drug called Libtayo® (cemiplimab).
