Ph I Dasatinib + Erlotinib in Recurrent MG
Primary:

To determine maximum tolerated dose \& dose limiting toxicity of dasatinib when combined w erlotinib among pts w recurrent MG

Secondary:

To further evaluate safety \& tolerability of dasatinib + erlotinib To evaluate pharmacokinetics of dasatinib when administered w erlotinib among recurrent MG pts who are on \& not on CYP-3A enzyme inducing anti-epileptic drugs To evaluate for anti-tumor activity with this regimen in this patient population
Glioblastoma|Gliosarcoma
DRUG: Erlotinib and Dasatinib
To determine MTD & DLT of Dasatinib when combined w Erlotinib among pts w Recurrent MG, 12 months

Tarceva administered on continuous oral dosing schedule at 150 mg/day for pts not on EIAEDs \& 450 mg/day for pts on EIAEDs. Starting dose level of dasatinib will be 100 mg once day via continuous oral daily dosing. Dasatinib will be increased in successive cohorts of enrolled pts. Pts will remain on treatment until excessive toxicity, progressive disease, withdrawal of consent/death.

Pts have confirmed diagnosis of recurrent/progressive WHO gr IV MG / WHO grade III MG. Phase I 3+3 dose escalation design w 2 independently escalated stratum: stratum A-pts not on CYP3A-enzyme inducing anti-epileptic drugs; stratum B-pts on EIAEDs. Assessment of safety will be based mainly on frequency of adverse events, particularly adverse events leading to discontinuation of treatment \& on number of significant lab abnormalities.
