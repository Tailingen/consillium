A Study of Metformin With or Without Rapamycin as Maintenance Therapy After Induction Chemotherapy in Subjects With Pancreatic Cancer
This is a phase 1b, multi-center, open label, randomized study to evaluate the safety and feasibility of administering metformin with or without rapamycin after disease stabilization on chemotherapy in subjects with metastatic PDA.
Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: metformin alone (Arm A)|DRUG: metformin (Arm B)|DRUG: rapamycin (Arm B)
safety and feasibility, To determine the safety and feasibility of administering metformin with or without rapamycin in subjects with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) after disease stabilization on chemotherapy., 1 year
FDG uptake, To evaluate fludeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in metastatic PDA subjects treated with metformin with or without rapamycin., 1 year|mTOR activity, To measure mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of subjects treated with metformin with or without rapamycin., 1 year|estimation of RR, TTP, PFS, OS, To estimate response rate (RR), time to progression (TTP), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in subjects with metastatic PDA treated with metformin with or without rapamycin., 1 year|CA19-9 measurement, To measure tumor marker kinetics (CA 19-9) in subjects treated with metformin with or without rapamycin., 1 year
Subjects with metastatic PDA who have received FOLFIRINOX or a gemcitabine-containing regimen and have achieved stable disease or better will be enrolled onto this study. Subjects should have had at least 6 months of chemotherapy and decline continuation of chemotherapy and should have stable disease or better on 2 scans taken at least 6 weeks apart. If applicable, subjects should also have a stable or declining CA19-9.

Twenty-two subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to metformin (Arm A) or metformin + rapamycin (Arm B). Subjects will be stratified according to their prior chemotherapy regimen: FOLFIRINOX or a gemcitabine-containing regimen.

Treatments will be administered orally on a 28 day cycle. Metformin will be administered 850mg twice daily and rapamycin will be administered 4mg daily.
