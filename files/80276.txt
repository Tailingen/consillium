64Cu-ATSM PET/CT in Rectum Cancer (TEP 64Cu-ATSM-Rectum)
This phase II trial is assessing how 64Cu-ATSM (64Cu-copper(II) diacetylbis(N4-methylthiosemicarbazone)) PET/CT scan could predict neo adjuvant treatment response in rectum cancer locally advanced
Rectal Cancer
DRUG: 64Cu-ATSM
Relationship between early tumor uptake of 64Cu-ATSM PET/CT images and prediction of histological response to neo-adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy treatment, Early tumor uptake of 64Cu-ATSM will be assessed by SUV (Standardized Uptake Value) measurement, histological response Will be assessed by Rodel grading (Tumor Regression Grading), 4 months
Relationship between late tumor uptake of 64Cu-ATSM PET/CT images and prediction of histological response to neo-adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy treatment, Late tumor uptake of 64Cu-ATSM will be assessed by SUV (Standardized Uptake Value) measurement, histological response Will be assessed by Rodel grading (Tumor Regression Grading), 4 months|Correlation between 64Cu-ATSM uptake and oxidative stress markers, Aggressive zones corresponding to high redox potential areas will be assessed by Immuno-histochemical analysis on the surgical sample and on the pre-therapeutic biopsy, 4 months|Progression free survival, Progression Free survival is the delay between surgery and the date of documented disease progression, 2 years|18FDG-PET/CT and 64Cu-PET/CT uptakes, Correlation between 18FDG-PET/CT and 64Cu-PET/CT uptakes, 45 days|Comparison between early and late 64Cu-ATSM uptakes in 64Cu-ATSM PET/CT images, Early and Late tumor uptake of 64Cu-ATSM will be assessed by SUV (Standardized Uptake Value) measurement, 45 days|64Cu-ATSM toxicity, 64Cu-ATSM toxicity will be assessed by vital signs monitoring within 2 hours after 64Cu-ATSM injection, 45 days
The purpose of this study is to evaluate early and late tumor uptake of 64Cu-ATSM in predicting histological response to neo-adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy treatment in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.

Patients receive pre-therapeutic CT scan, Pelvic MRI and 18FDG (fluorodeoxyglucose) PET/CT (positron emission tomography) scan within 45 days before enrollment.

64Cu-ATSM PET/CT scan is done before chemoradiotherapy treatment start. About 3 MBq/Kg of 64Cu-ATSM are injected intravenously, two acquisition sequences are performed 1 hour and 23 to 25 hours after injection in order to evaluate early and late tumor uptake of 64Cu-ATSM.

Patients are treated for 5 weeks by Capecitabine chemotherapy (1600 mg/m2/day) combined to 50 Gy radiotherapy.

Pelvic MRI is performed 4 weeks after chemotherapy in order to evaluate the treatment efficacy.

Surgery is scheduled 6 to 8 weeks after chemoradiotherapy. Tissue samples from previously collected rectal biopsy (obtained for diagnosis) and from surgery are used for assessing oxidative stress markers by Immuno-histochemical analysis.

Chest, abdomen and pelvis CT scan is performed every 6 months after surgery in order to assess progression free survival.
