A Study of INCMGA00012, INCB001158, and the Combination in Japanese Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability and the pharmacokinetics (PK) of INCMGA00012 (PD-1 Inhibitor), INCB001158 (Arginase Inhibitor), and the combination in Japanese participants with advanced solid tumor malignancies.
