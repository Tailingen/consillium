A Safety and Preliminary Efficacy Study of CC-99282, Alone and in Combination With Anti-lymphoma Agents in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas (R/R NHL)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of CC-99282 alone and in combination with anti-lymphoma agents in participants with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.
Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin

Determined by the Lugano Classification for NHL response criteria, Up to approximately 6 years|ORR, Defined as the percent of subjects whose best response is Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR).

Determined using the modified International PCNSL Collaborative Group (IPCG) criteria, Up to approximately 4 years|TTR, Determined using the modified International PCNSL Collaborative Group (IPCG) criteria, Up to approximately 4 years|DOR, Determined using the modified International PCNSL Collaborative Group (IPCG) criteria, Up to approximately 4 years|PFS, Determined using the modified International PCNSL Collaborative Group (IPCG) criteria, Up to approximately 4 years|OS, Determined using the modified International PCNSL Collaborative Group (IPCG) criteria, Up to approximately 4 years
Participants with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (R/R NHL) who have failed at least 2 lines of therapy (or have received at least one prior line of standard therapy and are not eligible for any other therapy).

The dose escalation will evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of CC-99282 in relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (R/R DLBCL) and/or relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (R/R FL) participants to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CC-99282 as monotherapy.

The dose expansion will further evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of single agent CC-99282 or the safety and preliminary efficacy of CC-99282 in combination with anti-lymphoma agents in participants with R/R DLBCL and NHL.

Part B Cohort B will further evaluate the potential effects of food on the PK and safety of CC-99282.
