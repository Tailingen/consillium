A Training Set for the HRD Model in EOC
A homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) scoring model based on loss of heterozygosity (LOH) is little explored in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients. This study would recruit 200 Chinese EOC patients with known BRCA1/2 mutation status and resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy. A LOH-HRD model is to be constructed based on the genetic testing in these patients. The mutated genes, HRD score model and their relationship with the prognosis, would provide a full description of for the Chinese EOC patients, and a potential explanation of platinum-resistance in such population.

GENETIC: Homologous recombination deficiency model
Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) score, The HRD score for individual patient is a scale describing her HRD status. The score model is calculated by the analysis for loss of heterozygosity (LOH), and the minimum value is 0, but the maximun value is not available. Higher scores mean more sensitivity to poly-ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitor, Two years
Progression-free survival, Progression-free survival in recruited patients, Five years|Overall survival, Overall survival in recruited patients, Five years
