A Study to Evaluate Tovorafenib in Pediatric and Young Adult Participants With Relapsed or Progressive Low-Grade Glioma and Advance Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 2, multi center, open-label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Type II RAF (tovorafenib) in pediatric participants with low-grade glioma or advanced solid tumors. Qualifying genomic alterations will be identified through molecular assays as routinely performed at Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) of 1988 or other similarly certified laboratories prior to enrollment into any of the arms. The study will consist of a screening period, a treatment period, a long-term extension phase, end of treatment (EOT) visit(s), a safety follow-up visit, and long-term follow-up assessments.
