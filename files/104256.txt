Pilot Study of Irreversible Electroporation (IRE) to Treat Metastatic Liver Cancer & Cholangiocarcinoma
Single-arm pilot clinical trial. Patients will be subjected to irreversible electroporation (IRE) as the sole treatment of nodules not considered treatable by resection or thermal ablation.
Metastatic Liver Cancer|Cholangiocarcinoma|Neoplasm Metastasis
PROCEDURE: Irreversible electroporation (IRE)
Effectiveness of IRE for the treatment of metastatic liver cancer or cholangiocarcinoma., The primary measurement parameter for the purposes of this determination is the evaluation of the response of IRE treated lesions according to modified RECIST criteria using CT images or magnetic resonance imaging performed 20 to 40 days after treatment., 1 month post-intervention
Safety, The safety endpoint will be the occurrence of serious adverse events related to treatment within 30 days of treatment. All adverse events will be classified according to CTCAE version 3.0 criteria., 30 days post-intervention|Time to in situ recurrence, 2 years post-intervention
Single-arm pilot clinical trial. Patients will be subjected to irreversible electroporation (IRE) as the sole treatment of nodules not considered treatable by resection or thermal ablation.

This pilot study was designed to study the feasibility and safety of treatment as an alternative therapeutic IRE in the treatment of neoplastic nodules in the liver, with particular reference to metastatic liver cancer and cholangiocarcinoma, where the current therapeutic arsenal is inadequate or counter-indicated.

To perform the IRE procedure the IRE NanoKnifeâ„¢ System (AngioDynamics) will be used.
