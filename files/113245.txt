Prospective Evaluation of Infectious Vulvovaginitis on Wound Complication Rates After Vulvar Excision for Premalignant Lesions
Primary:

* To measure the rate of perioperative vulvovaginitis in a population of patients in central VA with non-malignant vulvar disease who require surgical excision
* To correlate the rate of vulvovaginitis with rate of wound cellulitis and incisional breakdown in patients undergoing SPV/WLE for vulvar disease We will use a vulvovaginal swab to test for the most common causes of vulvovaginitis - bacterial vaginosis (BV), trichomonas, and candida. The swab will be collected preoperatively on day of surgery. The outcome will be evaluated by phone call to patient at 1 week after surgery and physical exam at the postoperative visit between 4-6 weeks.
