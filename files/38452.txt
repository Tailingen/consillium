MICHL-trial: Impact of Peritoneal Bladder Flap in RARP Patients on Lymphoceles
A two-armed prospective randomised, controlled, single-centre trial on 1080 patients with prostate cancer who underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy with bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection was carried out. Patients in the intervention arm received fixation of the peritoneal flap of the bladder to the plexus Santorini at the end of surgery (Michl-technique, MT); in the control group, surgery was performed without this modification. The primary endpoint was the rate of lymphoceles requiring intervention.
