A Study of GSK5733584 in Combination With Anti-cancer Therapies for Advanced Solid Tumors
Advanced solid tumors are cancers that have spread to other parts of the body. While many treatments exist, most people become resistant to them, and the cancer returns. Researchers are developing new treatments that combine different medicines for those who do not respond to single medicine. This study is looking at how safe and tolerable GSK5733584 is, how the body handles it, and how well it works when used with other cancer medicines. The study will include participants with advanced solid tumors who have either not responded to standard treatments or cannot tolerate them or have no available effective treatment.
