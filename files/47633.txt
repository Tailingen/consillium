The Effect of a Mediterranean Diet Intervention on Cancer-related Fatigue and Mitochondrial Function During Chemotherapy
This study will assess the feasibility of delivering an 8-week Mediterranean Diet intervention as well as the intervention's preliminary efficacy on cancer-related fatigue among patients undergoing chemotherapy, compared to usual care. In the first 4 weeks of the intervention, we will provide the participants with food and educate them on the principles and components of the Mediterranean Diet, while in the second 4 weeks participants will prepare their own food. In addition, we will evaluate changes in metabolism and mitochondrial function during 4 weeks of chemotherapy and determine how adherence to a Mediterranean diet modulates these changes during these 4 weeks.

The hypothesis is that the intervention will promote adherence to the Mediterranean Diet. The second hypothesis is that adherence will be associated with alleviation of fatigue and improvements in metabolic and mitochondrial function.

BEHAVIORAL: Mediterranean Diet
The Number of Patients Who Enrolled Completed the Study., To assess feasibility of the study, we will report what percentage of patients who enrolled completed the study., 8 weeks|Scores From the 14-item Mediterranean Diet Questionnaire, In order to assess adherence to the diet, we will report scores from the 14-item Mediterranean Diet questionnaire at 8 weeks. Scores range from 0 to 14 points. A higher score indicates greater adherence to the Mediterranean Diet., 8 weeks
The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness-Fatigue (FACIT-F) Questionnaire, Fatigue will be measured using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness-Fatigue (FACIT-F). This is a 40-item questionnaire in which a higher score indicates greater well-being. Scores range from 0-160., 8 weeks|The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness-Fatigue (FACIT-F) Questionnaire, Fatigue Subscale, Fatigue will be measured using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness-Fatigue (FACIT-F), fatigue subscale. This is a 13-item subscale of the FACIT-F questionnaire in which a higher score indicates less fatigue. Scores range from 0-52., 8 weeks
