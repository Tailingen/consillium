The purpose of this study is to compare the effects, good and bad, of two ways to treat patients with standard-risk symptomatic multiple myeloma. Patients with standard-risk myeloma have myeloma with specific features: levels of 2 blood tests have to be in a specific range and there can be no myeloma tumors found outside of the bones or bone marrow, the areas where myeloma is usually discovered. In past clinical studies, patients with standard-risk myeloma have done well with intensive therapy in the form of stem cell transplant. But multiple myeloma is not curable and, although it may respond to standard treatments including stem cell transplant, myeloma always recurs.

PROCEDURE: Stem cell transplant x 1 or x 2|DRUG: lenalidomide and dexamethasone
Progression Free Survival (PFS) Rate at 2 Years After Enrollment in Untreated Patients With Multiple Myeloma., 2 years
Number of Participants With VGPR + CR Rate, VGPR/Very Good Partial Response + CR/Complete Response (\>/= VGPR) for each study arm

Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR, 2 years|Overall Response Rates, Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR, 2 years|Overall Survival, up to 4 years
