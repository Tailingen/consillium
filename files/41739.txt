Effect of Anesthesia on Optic Nerve Sheath Diameter in Patients Undergoing Robot-assisted Laparoscopic Prostatectomy
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the difference between the optic nerve sheath diameter measured during total intravenous anesthesia and the optic nerve sheath diameter measured during inhalation anesthesia in patients undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy.

PROCEDURE: Total intravenous anesthesia|PROCEDURE: Inhalation anesthesia
Difference in optic nerve sheath diameter, Difference between the optic nerve sheath diameter measured during total intravenous anesthesia and the optic nerve sheath diameter measured during inhalation anesthesia, 60 minutes after pneumoperitoneum and steep Trendelenburg position
Difference in optic nerve sheath diameter, Difference between the optic nerve sheath diameter measured during total intravenous anesthesia and the optic nerve sheath diameter measured during inhalation anesthesia, 30 minutes after pneumoperitoneum and steep Trendelenburg position|Difference in optic nerve sheath diameter, Difference between the optic nerve sheath diameter measured during total intravenous anesthesia and the optic nerve sheath diameter measured during inhalation anesthesia, 5 minutes after pneumoperitoneum and steep Trendelenburg position
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the difference between the optic nerve sheath diameter measured during total intravenous anesthesia with propofol and remifentanil and the optic nerve sheath diameter measured during inhalation anesthesia with sevoflurane and remifentanil in patients undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy.
