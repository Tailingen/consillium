Cancer treatment-induced thrombocytopenia (CTIT) refers to a decrease in platelet count caused by antitumor therapies during cancer treatment. It is a common adverse effect of anticancer treatment, with a particularly high incidence in patients with hematologic malignancies. CTIT increases the risk of bleeding, may limit treatment options, and can ultimately compromise the effectiveness of cancer therapy and reduce long-term survival. Currently, aside from platelet transfusion, thrombopoietic agents are commonly used to manage CTIT. Studies have shown that Romiplostim demonstrates a response rate of up to 71% in patients with chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia from solid tumors, with 89% of patients avoiding the need for platelet transfusion, thereby significantly reducing the risk of bleeding. However, there is limited evidence and a lack of prospective clinical trials investigating the use of Romiplostim in leukemia patients with CTIT. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Romiplostim in adult leukemia patients with CTIT, in order to provide new therapeutic options and strategies, and ultimately improve the quality of life for this patient population.
