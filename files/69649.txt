Developing a Real-Time PCR Assay for Fusobacterium and Epidemiological Analysis of Tumor Patients
This study presents an academic approach to developing a fluorescence quantitative PCR detection method capable of accurately measuring the presence of Fusobacterium (specifically F. nucleatum, F. mortiferium, F. varium, F. ulcerans, F. and F. necrogens) in human fecal samples. It aims to perform an epidemiological analysis on the presence of Fusobacterium in patients with tumors, elucidating the prevalence of Fusobacterium members in this patient population. Additionally, it seeks to investigate the potential correlation between Fusobacterium presence and various test indicators, diagnostic predictions, and prognosis outcomes.
Fusobacterium Infections

Fusobacterium nucleatum, a gram-negative obligate anaerobic bacterium, is known to colonize the oral cavity and is implicated in various diseases affecting the oropharynx, gastrointestinal tract, cardiovascular vessels, and genital tract. Precise classification of the Fusobacterium genus is of utmost importance as it will facilitate a deeper understanding of the pathogenicity of its members in tumor development, establish an accurate etiological association with tumors, and ultimately enhance clinical practice and epidemiological investigations.
