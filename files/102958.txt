CD7-specific CAR-T Cell in the Treatment of CD7-positive Relapsed/Refractory Hematologic Tumors
This study is a single-center, open, prospective single-arm clinical study of patients with CD7 postive relapsed / refractoryhematological tumors to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CD7-specific CAR-T cells in relapsed / refractory hematological tumors while collecting pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics indicators of CAR-T cells.
Hematologic Malignancy
DRUG: Fludarabine + Cyclophosphamide + CD7-specific CAR-T Cells
Overall response rate (ORR) of administering CD7-specific CAR-T Cells In the treatment of relapsed/refractory hematologic tumors, Disease overall response rate (ORR) will be assessed from CAR-T cell infusion to death or last follow-up (censored)., within 3 years after infusion|Incidence of Treatment-related Adverse Events, Therapy-related adverse events (AE), including severe adverse events (SAE) and laboratory outliers with clinical significance, will be recorded and assessed according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, Version 5.0)., Within 3 month after CD19&CD20 CAR-T infusion
In vivo expansion and survival of CD7-specific CAR-T Cells in relapsed/refractory hematological malignancies, Quantity of CD7 CAR copies in bone marrow, peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid will be determined by using flow cytometry and quantitative polymerase chain reaction., within 3 years after infusion
In order to study CD7-targeting CAR-T cell therapy, we constructed a lentiviral CAR structure. The CD7-targeting fragment was cloned into a second-generation CAR structural backbone with 4-1BB and CD3E. Since endogenous CD7 in T cells causes CD7-targeting CAR-T cells to kill each other, we used a natural selection method to prepare CD7-targeting CAR (CD7-CART) T cells that do not express the CD7 protein (CD7-).
