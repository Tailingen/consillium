PD-L1 Inhibitor Rechallenge After PD-1 Immunotherapy for Patients With Solid Tumor Beyond Lung Cancer
Anti-PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, is approved for the treatment of patients with unresectable, Stage III NSCLC whose disease has not progressed following concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy and radiation therapy, or as first-line treatment of patients with ES-SCLC in combination with etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin in China. The clinical data regarding the PD-L1 inhibitor in other solid tumors are limited.Investigators would observe and analyze the effectiveness and safety of PD-L1 inhibitor for patients with advanced - solid tumors beyond lung cancer after muti-line therapy to explore the synergistic effect of PD-L1 inhibitor rechallenge after PD-1immunotherapy.
