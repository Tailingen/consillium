M1231 in Participants With Solid Tumors
This study is to establish a safe and tolerable dose and to investigate pharmacokinetics and the first clinical efficacy signals of M1231 as a single agent in participants with solid tumors (Part 1) and with metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (Part 2). Dose escalation will be followed by the dose expansion once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended dose for Expansion (RDE) has been defined.
