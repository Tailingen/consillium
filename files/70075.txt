Safety and Efficacy Study of Hypofractionated Radiotherapy and Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of a short course of radiotherapy (40Gy/5 fractions/29 days) for the treatment of high risk prostate cancer currently being managed with primary androgen deprivation therapy (PADT).
Prostate Cancer
RADIATION: Hypofractionated radiation
Incidence of grade 3+ rectal toxicity, Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v3.0, Acute period (up to 3 months)
Incidence of grade 3+ urinary toxicity, Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v3.0, Acute (up to 3 months) and Late (after 6 months of follow-up)|Quality of Life, Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC), 5 years|Biochemical (ie.prostate specific antigen) disease free survival, 5 years|Incidence of grade 3+ rectal toxicity, Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v3.0, Late (after 6 months of follow-up)
Primary Endpoints:

* Acute gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v3.0 toxicities

Secondary Endpoints:

* Late GI and GU Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) toxicities
* Biochemical disease-free survival
* Biopsy positive rate at 3 years
* Quality of life using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) questionnaire
* Develop a biobank of DNA and serum extracted from blood and urine to analyze and develop new biomarkers for prostate cancer progression or susceptibility to severe toxicity
