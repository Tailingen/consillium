Financial Incentives and Motivational Intervention to Improve Gastric Cancer Screening in China
Gastric cancer, also known as stomach cancer, is a serious disease that affects the stomach. It's one of the most common types of cancer, and sadly, many people die from it each year. But there's hope! We can catch gastric cancer early with a special test called endoscopy. This test helps doctors find cancer or pre-cancerous changes in the stomach early, when it's easier to treat. However, not enough people get this test, especially in places where healthcare isn't easily available. That's why we're doing this study.

We want to find out if we can encourage more people to get the endoscopy test for gastric cancer. We're going to try two different ways to encourage people to get the test. First, we'll give some people money or other incentives to help cover the costs of getting the test. Second, we'll give others information and support to help them understand why the test is important and how it can help them.

We'll be doing this study in two provinces in China, where gastric cancer is a big problem. We'll ask thousands of people to join the study, and we'll randomly assign them to one of the two groups. Then, we'll see if more people in one group get the endoscopy test compared to the other group.

Our hope is that by finding out what works best, we can help more people catch gastric cancer early and get the treatment they need. This could save many lives and make a big difference in fighting this disease.

Gastric cancer (GC) remains a significant global health challenge, with high mortality rates, particularly in low- and middle-income country, like China. Early detection through screening is crucial for improving prognosis and reducing mortality. However, uptake of GC screening remains suboptimal, highlighting the need for effective interventions to promote screening participation.

This study employs an experimental design to evaluate the effectiveness of two interventions, financial incentives and motivational interventions, in promoting GC screening uptake at the individual level. A large sample size will be recruited from high GC-burden provinces in China, and participants will be randomly assigned to intervention and control groups. Statistical analyses, including Propensity Score Matching and Interrupted Time Series Analysis, will be utilized to assess the impact of interventions on screening uptake and adherence.

Findings from this study will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations, and engagement with stakeholders to inform evidence-based strategies for improving GC screening and reducing GC-related morbidity and mortality.
