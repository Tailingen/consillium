Hydroxychloroquine in Previously Treated Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
Hydroxychloroquine is approved for the treatment of non-cancerous illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematous. Researchers in the laboratory have tested tumors from patients with pancreatic cancer and have discovered that they have certain pathways inside the cells that promote growth and survival of the tumor. Hydroxychloroquine may inactivate these pathways and results in the death of pancreatic cancer cells.

DRUG: Hydroxychloroquine
2-month Progression-Free Survival Rate, 2-month progression-free survival rate was defined as the percentage of patients absent progression (PD) or death before 2 months. Patients were considered to have experienced PD if they demonstrated either clinical deterioration resulting in withdrawal or PD per RECIST 1.0 criteria: At least a 20% increase in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. PD for the evaluation of non-target lesions is the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions., Disease was evaluated radiologically at baseline and at the first restaging at 2 months.
Biochemical Response Rate, Biochemical response rate was defined as the percentage of patients achieving on treatment a decrease in serum CA 19-9 by \> 30% from baseline., Disease was evaluated radiologically at baseline and every 2 months on treatment. Median duration of treatment for this study cohort was 34 days.|Tumor Response Rate, Tumor response rate is the percentage of patients achieving complete or partial response on treatment based on RECIST 1.0 criteria. For target lesions, complete response (CR) is disappearance of all target lesions and partial response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum LD. CR for the evaluation of non-target lesions is the disappearance of non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. Appearance of one or more new lesions is classified as progression of non-target lesions. CR or PR confirmation is required \>/= 4 weeks., Disease was evaluated radiologically at baseline and every 2 months on treatment. Median duration of treatment for this study cohort was 34 days.|Overall Survival, Overall survival estimated using Kaplan-Meier (KM) methods is defined as the time from study entry to death or date last known alive., All patients were followed until death. Median survival follow-up in this study cohort was 60 days (95% CI: 40-184).|Progression-Free Survival, Progression-free survival based on the Kaplan-Meier method is defined as the duration of time from study entry to time of objective progression on CT scan or the time of death for patients with clinical deterioration resulting in withdrawal from the trial. Per RECIST 1.0 criteria: progressive disease (PD) is at least a 20% increase in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. PD for the evaluation of non-target lesions is the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions. Patients without an event were censored at date of last disease evaluation., Disease was evaluated radiologically at baseline and every 2 months on treatment. Median PFS follow-up in this study cohort was 46.5 days (95% CI 33-61).|Grade 4-5 Treatment-Related Toxicity, All grade 4-5 adverse events with treatment attribution of possibly, probably or definite based on CTCAEv3 as reported on case report forms., Adverse events were assessed each cycle throughout treatment. Participants were followed for the duration of treatment, an average of 34 days for this study population.
Primary Objective

* To determine the efficacy of single-agent hydroxychloroquine in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer previously treated with one or two prior chemotherapy regimens as measured by progression-free survival at two months

Secondary Objectives

* To assess tumor response rate, biochemical response rate (i.e. decrease in serum CA19-9 by \> 30%), and overall survival

Translational/Exploratory Objectives

* To investigate predictors of response to anti-autophagy therapy with hydroxychloroquine
* To explore the kinetics of in vivo autophagy inhibition using peripheral blood WBCs to monitor autophagic activity among patients receiving hydroxychloroquine
