Robotic surgery has been developed with the aim of improving surgical quality and overcoming the limitations of conventional laparoscopy in the performance of complex mini-invasive procedures. The study is designed to explore the clinical outcomes of the robotic assisted total gastrectomy by comparing short- and long-term outcomes including financial cost of robotic and laparoscopic assisted total gastrectomy in the treatment of clinical Stage I gastric adenocarcinoma （cStage IA（T1N0M0）or cStage IB（T1N1M0，T2N0M0））.
