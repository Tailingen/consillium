Anti-CDH17 CAR-T Cell Injection in Patients With CDH17-positive Advanced Malignant Solid Tumors
This is a single-arm, open-label, exploratory clinical study to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of Anti-CDH17 CAR-T cell injection in patients with CDH17-positive advanced malignant solid tumors.
CDH17-positive Advanced Malignant Solid Tumors
BIOLOGICAL: Anti-CDH17 CAR-T cells
Adverse Events (AEs), Incidence and severity of adverse events., 2 years|Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Incidence and severity of serious adverse events., 2 years|Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI), Incidence and severity of adverse event of special interest., 2 years|Identification of Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) & Incidence of Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs), Incidence and severity of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) following infusion of CAR-T cell injection, at each dose level tested in dose escalation phase., 4 weeks after the CAR-T cells infusion
Objective Response Rate (ORR), The Objective Response Rate (ORR) is the percentage of participants who achieved Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) based on RECIST version 1.1., 2 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Disease control rate (DCR) is the percentage of participants who achieved Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) or Stable disease (SD) based on RECIST version 1.1., 2 years|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from CAR-T infusion to the date of the disease progression or death from any cause., 2 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from CAR-T infusion to the date of death due to any cause., 2 years|Bio-distribution of CAR-T cells, CAR copies will be measured by qPCR to evaluate the expansion and persistence of CAR-T cells in vivo. Cmax, Tmax, AUC0-tlast and AUC0-inf of CAR copies will be analyzed., 2 years|Cytokine Level in Peripheral Blood, Level of cytokines (IL-2、IL-6、IL-8、IL-10、TNF-α and IFN-γ, etc.) in serum., 2 years|Anti-drug Antibodies, Number of participants with anti-drug antibodies., 2 years
This study will include two parts, dose escalation phase (accelerated titration and 3+3 design) followed by a dose expansion phase.

All eligible participants will receive a conditioning chemotherapy regimen of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide followed by Anti-CDH17 CAR-T cell injection.

The dose escalation phase will determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Anti-CDH17 CAR-T cell injection. Additional patients will be enrolled in the dose expansion phase to further characterize the safety profile and evaluate the efficacy of Anti-CDH17 CAR-T cell injection, and establish recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).
