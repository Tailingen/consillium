HPPH Photodynamic Therapy for Patients With Esophageal Cancer
Phase I study was to investigate the safety and tolerability of the photosensitizer (PS) 2-\[1-hexyloxyethyl\]-2-devinyl pyropheophorbide-a (HPPH) for injection in patients with Esophageal Cancer. It was to characterize the pharmacokinetics of HPPH and efficacy of HPPH.

The number of dose-limiting toxicity, Dose-limiting toxicity would be assesed by CTCAE4.0, Day 1 to Day 10
Maximum observed concentration (Cmax), PK measurement expressed as Cmax for HPPH, Day 1 to Day 84|Time to maximum concentration (tmax), PK measurement expressed as Tmax for HPPH, Day 1 to Day 84|Apparent terminal elimination phase half (t1/2), PK measurement expressed as t1/2 for HPPH, Day 1 to Day 84|Area under the concentration-time curve over the dosing interval (AUC0-t), PK measurement expressed as AUC0-t for HPPH, Day 1 to Day 84|Area under the concentration-time curve from zero extrapolated to infinity (AUC0-∞), PK measurement expressed as AUC0-∞ for HPPH, Day 1 to Day 84
The present study is phase I study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of multiple ascending injection doses of HPPH in Patients with Esophageal Cancer. Up to 30 patients are planned to be enrolled in 6 cohorts with each cohort consisting of 3-6 patients ( male and/or female patients). In each cohort, patients will receive HPPH and Lyophilized treatment. The dose escalation in Cohorts was from 2.5 to 3, 3.5, 4, 5, and 6mg/m2 of HPPH, respectively, administered intravenous drop infusion over 1 hour, once daily, and a fixed light dose of 150 J/cm delivered 48 hours after infusion of HPPH.
