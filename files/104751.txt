BKM120 + mFOLFOX6 in Advanced Solid Tumors With Expansion Cohort Pancreatic Cancer
The purpose of this study is to establish the safety and tolerability of BKM120 when combined with mFOLFOX6 and to define the maximum tolerated dose of BKM120 in this combination in advanced solid tumors including metastatic pancreatic cancer.

Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), A dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as an adverse event or abnormal laboratory value assessed as unrelated to disease, disease progression, inter-current illness, or concomitant medications, and occurs within the first cycle of therapy (4 weeks)of BKM120 when administered with mFOLFOX6 in patients with advanced solid tumors including metastatic pancreatic cancer., 3 years|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), The MTD is defined as a dose with a Dose Limiting Toxicity rate of 20% for BKM120 when administered with mFOLFOX6 in patients with advanced solid tumors including metastatic pancreatic cancer., 3 years
Number of subjects experiencing adverse events, Using CTCAE criteria, we will identify acute and chronic toxicities of BKM120 in combination with mFOLFOX6 in patients with advanced solid tumors including metastatic pancreatic cancer, 3 years|Progression Free Survival (PFS), The length of time subject's disease does not get worse from time of start of treatment with BKM120 in combination with mFOLFOX6 in patients with advanced solid tumors including metastatic pancreatic cancer., 4 years|Overall Survival(OS), Length of survival after treatment with the MTD of BKM120 in combination with mFOLFOX6 in patients with advanced solid tumors including metastatic pancreatic cancer., 7 years|Biomarkers of Clinical Benefit, To examine potential correlations between blood and tissue biomarkers and clinical benefit of BKM120 when administered with mFOLFOX6 in patients with advanced solid tumors including metastatic pancreatic cancer., 3 years
This single arm, multicenter, open-label Phase I clinical trial has been designed to establish the safety and tolerability of dose escalating BKM120 when combined with mFOLFOX6 and to define the MTD of BKM120 in this combination. Secondary objective will be to estimate the response rate, Progression Free Survival rate, and Overall Survival rate, after treatment with the Maximum Tolerated Dose of BKM120 in combination with mFOLFOX6 in patients with advanced solid tumors and metastatic pancreatic cancer. Eligible patients will be treated with BKM120 orally (PO), once per day (QD) in combination with mFOLFOX6 administered intravenously (IV) every 2 weeks on Days 1 and 15 of each cycle using a standard 3+3 dose escalation scheme. Each cycle will be repeated every 4 weeks (28 days). FOLFOX6 treatment will be as follows: Oxaliplatin: 85 mg/m2 IV, Leucovorin: 400 mg/m2 IV, 5FU bolus: 400 mg/m2 IV and 5FU infusion: 2400 mg/m2 IV.

In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events (AEs), treatment may continue until: disease progression, intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment, unacceptable AE(s), patient decides to withdraw from the study, or general or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.
