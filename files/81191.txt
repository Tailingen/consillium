SBRT Combined With Nimotuzumab and Mono-chemotherapy in Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
This is a prospective, multicenter, single arm clinical study. The main purpose of the study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of SBRT combined with Nimotuzumab and mono-chemotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC).

progression-free survival (PFS), PFS, defined as the time from the beginning of treatment to disease progression or all-cause death. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., Up to 12 months
overall survival (OS), The time from the beginning of treatment to death due to any cause., Up to 12 months|Objective response rate (ORR), Objective response rate (ORR), including complete response (CR) and partial response (PR). Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by CT/MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions., Up to 12 months|Disease control rate (DCR), Disease control rate (DCR), including complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) and stable disease(SD). Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by CT/MRI: CR, disappearance of all target lesions; PR, at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions. SD, neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD (PD, defined as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions)., Up to 12 months|Pain relief rate, The proportion of patients with pain relief after treatment to the total number enrolled., Up to 12 months|adverse events, Frequency and severity of adverse events., Up to 30 days after last administration
This clinical study is designed as a prospective, multicenter, single arm study to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of SBRT combined with nimotuzumab and mono-chemotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC). All eligible patients will receive SBRT with doses ranging from 35-40 Gy in five fractions, intravenous nimotuzumab 400mg weekly or 600mg on day 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle, and mono-chemotherapy (Gemcitabine, S-1 or capecitabine) until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, or consent withdrawal. The main endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS).
