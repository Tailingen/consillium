Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors and Radiotherapy in Relapsed/Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma
This is an observational retrospective study to investigate the efficacy and safety of the treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (nivolumab or pembrolizumab) in combination with radiotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma.
Hodgkin Lymphoma|Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor|Radiotherapy
DRUG: Immune checkpoint inhibitor
Complete remission (CR) rate measured according to Lugano and Lyric criteria by CT-PET (positron emission tomography / computer tomography) or CT (computer tomography) scan, up to 2 months after the end of ICI or 3 months after the end of RT
overall response rate (ORR) measured according to Lugano and Lyric criteria by CT-PET or CT scan, up to 2 months after the end of ICI or 3 months after the end of RT|progression-free survival (PFS) measured according to Cheson 2007 response criteria, from the start of the treatment until the date of documented progression or date of death from any cause, assessed up to 5 years|safety profile assessed by monitoring adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) according to CTCAE v. 4.0, through study completion, for an average of 1 year
In patients with relapsed/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma, treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), nivolumab and pembrolizumab, leads to 20-30% of complete remission (CR) rate. This means that for the majority of patients a consolidation strategy is usually offered, in order to reduce relapse rate.

Strategies to improve CR rates should therefore be implemented, including combination treatments. In solid tumors, the combination of ICIs and radiotherapy led to higher response rates without mjor toxicity concerns. Radiotherapy is an effective therapeutic option already used in Hodgkin lymphoma patients, also in the setting of relapsed/refractory disease. In his observational study we aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ICIs and radiotherapy administered in combination in patients with relapsed/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma.
