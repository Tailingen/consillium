The 2021 CSCO guidelines recommend treatment for patients with advanced TNBC as follows: Taxoides are generally preferred for patients who have failed anthracycline therapy in the past; For patients with anthracycline and taxane treatment failure, there is no standard therapy. Previously unused chemotherapy alone or in combination can be considered. However, the toxicity of combination chemotherapy is high and the survival benefit is limited, therefore, in consideration of the quality of life of advanced patients, single-agent chemotherapy is recommended as a priority.
