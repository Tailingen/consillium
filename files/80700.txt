International Lung Screen Trial (ILST)
People who may be at increased risk of lung cancer due to age and smoking history will be invited to participate in this international study to determine the best way of using computed tomography (CT) of the chest to screen for early lung cancer. Overseas data show that CT screening (screening tests can find diseases early, when they're easier to treat) can reduce deaths from lung cancer and this study will help determine who is most likely benefit from screening.
