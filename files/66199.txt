Study of Gemcitabine/Carboplatin First-line Chemotherapy +/- Apatorsen in Advanced Squamous Cell Lung Cancers
This study is being carried out to see if a new drug called Apatorsen in combination with standard gemcitabine/carboplatin chemotherapy is effective in treating squamous cell lung cancer.

This study is part of a research project for collecting information about the effectiveness and safety of Apatorsen when used with gemcitabine/carboplatin chemotherapy. The main purpose of this study is to see if Apatorsen, when combined with gemcitabine/carboplatin, is an effective treatment for squamous cell lung cancer.

Recent research has found that a protein called Hsp27 can help cancer cells protect themselves against the effects of cancer treatments. Hsp27 is only found in some lung cancers but when it is present, cancer drugs might not work as well as they would without Hsp27 being present. Blocking the action of Hsp27 or removing Hsp27 from cancer cells with Apatorsen may slow down or stop the cancer growing. This study will therefore look at the relationship between the Hsp27 levels in tumour and blood and the effect of the treatment.

The development of Apatorsen is intended to provide a new treatment option for patients with cancer. Apatorsen may also make the cancer more sensitive to gemcitabine and carboplatin and so make this chemotherapy treatment more effective.

Exposure is defined as average gemcitabine/carboplatin + Apatorsen (OGX-427) dose per week over whole treatment period.

Gemcitabine/carboplatin chemotherapy will be continued for 6 cycles (each cycle is 21 days) unless there is evidence of unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, or if the patient requests that study treatment be discontinued or to be withdrawn from the study. If chemotherapy is discontinued prior to disease progression, patients in the combination arm should be continued on Apatorsen (OGX-427) single agent therapy until disease progression unless there is evidence of unacceptable toxicity, patient withdrawal of consent or termination of the study, whichever occurs first., 4-6 cycles of treatment (12-18 weeks) and for apatorsen arm until disease progression (estimated 7.5 months)|Compare the differences in health-related Quality of Life (HRQL) and symptoms for patients by treatment assignment as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung (FACT-L) scale, and the Euro-QOL 5D (EQ-5D), Compare the differences in health-related quality of life (HRQL) and symptoms for patients by treatment assignment, Baseline, once every 3 weeks for 18 weeks and 4 weeks after last dose (estimated 8.8 months)|Establish the safety and tolerability of gemcitabine/carboplatin + Apatorsen relative to gemcitabine/carboplatin alone, Establish the safety and tolerability of gemcitabine/carboplatin + apatorsen (OGX-427) relative to gemcitabine/carboplatin alone.

This will include:

* Incidence of serious adverse events
* Incidence of grade 3 or higher adverse events (CTCAE, version 4.0)
* Incidence of all adverse events of all grades
* Incidence of infusion reactions and infusion-related adverse events
* Adverse events leading to discontinuation of the study medication
* Incidence of Grade 3 and 4 clinical laboratory results following study drug administration (CTCAE, version 4.0.3), 3 weeks before treatment to 4 weeks after last dose (estimated 8.5 months)
Alterations in DNA and RNA, Explore potential biomarkers that may help predict response to gemcitabine/carboplatin + Apatorsen (OGX-427) compared with gemcitabine/carboplatin alone., Baseline, day 1 of each cycle (each cycle is 21 days), every 3 weeks during maintenance and 4 weeks after last dose (estimated 8.5 months)|Clinical Benefit, defined as number of patients with complete or partial response or stable disease maintained â‰¥24 weeks (as assessed by the site radiologist and/ or investigator, using RECIST 1.1), Estimate the clinical benefit of chemotherapy + Apatorsen (OGX-427) relative to chemotherapy alone in patients with and without high Hsp27 expression in tumour tissue and by analysing the reduction of serum Hsp27 levels during treatment., 24 weeks until progression (estimated 7.5 months)
This is an open-label, multicentre, 2-arm randomised phase II trial of gemcitabine/carboplatin + Apatorsen (OGX-427) versus gemcitabine/carboplatin alone in patients with previously untreated advanced squamous cell lung cancers. Patients will be randomised (1:1) to one of the two treatment arms:

* Gemcitabine/carboplatin
* Gemcitabine/carboplatin + Apatorsen (OGX-427)

Randomisation will be stratified by the following criteria:

* Stage (IIIB versus IV versus recurrent disease)
* Performance status (0 or 1 versus 2)

Gemcitabine/carboplatin chemotherapy will be continued for 4-6 cycles unless there is evidence of unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, or if the patient requests that study treatment be discontinued or to be withdrawn from the study. If chemotherapy is discontinued prior to disease progression, patients in the combination arm should be continued on Apatorsen (OGX-427) single agent therapy until disease progression unless there is evidence of unacceptable toxicity, patient withdrawal of consent or termination of the study, whichever occurs first. All patients will be followed for disease progression. Tumour evaluations will be performed before the initiation of treatment and every 6 weeks during and after completion of chemotherapy. Once disease progression is documented, patients will enter a Survival Follow-up Period during which data will be collected every two months regarding further cancer therapy, secondary malignancy and survival status. The study will also assess the relationship between the anticipated anti-tumour activity of the treatment regimen and biological characteristics of patients' tumours at baseline.
