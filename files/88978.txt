Hypofractionated Radiotherapy and Concurrent Cisplatin for Head and Neck Cancer
The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of hypofractionated radiation therapy and concomitant chemotherapy with cisplatin for locally advanced head and neck cancer in a high volume brazilian center.
Radiotherapy; Complications
RADIATION: Hypofractionated Radiotherapy|DRUG: Weekly cisplatin
To evaluate the rate of patient who could complete the treatment., The treatment is considered completed when patients receive at least 90% of radiation dose (49,5Gy) with a cumulative cisplatin dose of 105mg/m2 or more (3 of 4 cycles) and the treatment duration is inferior to 35 consecutive days., up to 5 years after patient accrual|To evaluate the rate of participants with treatment-related adverse events, as assessed by investigators using the CTCAE v4.0 criteria, up to 5 years after patient accrual
Quality of life according to the EORTC C30 questionaire and EORTC H&N 35 (evaluated together), Frequency and intensity of symptoms as described by patients before treatment (baseline), at the end of treatment, 1 month, 7 months and after 1 year following the treatment., up to 18 months from treatment|Response rate, as determined by investigators using RECIST v1.1 criteria, up to 4 months after patient accrual
To evaluate if concomitant cisplatin and hypofractionated radiation therapy wold be feasible in a brazilian population.
