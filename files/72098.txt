For patients with CMML, EFS will be defined as the time from treatment start until disease progression, relapse after CR, CCR, PR, MR or CB, treatment failure, or death from any cause, whichever comes first., From the date of treatment initiation until death or up to 1.5 years from patient's first dose, whichever comes first|Relapse-free Survival (RFS), For patients with diagnosis of AML in the primary analysis it is measured only for patients achieving CR or CRi, and it is defined as the time from the date of first achievement of a CR/CRi until the date of relapse or death from any cause.

For patients with CMML diagnosis, RFS will be measured from the date of first achievement of CR, CCR, PR, MR or CB until the date of relapse or death from any cause., From the date of treatment initiation until death or up to 1.5 years from patient's first dose, whichever comes first|For AML and in Phase II only: Complete Remission (CR) Rate, Defined as the number of patients who achieve a CR as Best Response, divided by the number of participants in the analysis population., From the date of first response up to end of study (approximately 1.5 years)|For AML and in Phase II only: Complete Remission and Complete Remission with Partial Hematologic Recovery (CR/CRh) Rate, Defined as the number of patients who achieve a CR or CRh or CRi as best response, divided by the number of participants in the analysis population., From the date of first response up to end of study (approximately 1.5 years)|For AML and in Phase II only: Overall Response Rate (ORR: CRc + CRh + MLFS + PR), Defined as the number of participants who achieve CR, CRi, CRh, MLFS or PR as best response, divided by the number of participants in the analysis population., From the date of first response up to end of study (approximately 1.5 years)|Rate of conversion from transfusion-dependence to transfusion-independence, Defined as the proportion of participants being post-baseline transfusion independent from baseline transfusion dependence., From the date of first response up to end of study (approximately 1.5 years)
