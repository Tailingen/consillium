Ibd CAncer and seRious Infections in France (I-CARE 2)
This is a French prospective longitudinal observational multicentre cohort study.

Primary objective : to assess prospectively the presence and the extent of safety concerns (cancer, serious infections, arterial and venous thrombotic events) in patients with CD and UC and treated with JAKi, anti-IL23p19, and S1p modulators.
IBD|Ulcerative Colitis|Crohn Disease
OTHER: Non-interventional
Number of SAE declared by patients (cancer, serious infections, arterial and venous thrombotic events), The primary objective of I-CARE 2 is to assess prospectively the presence and the extent of safety concerns (cancer, serious infections, arterial and venous thrombotic events) in patients with CD and UC and treated with JAKi, anti-IL23p19, and S1p modulators.

The risk of cancers, serious infections and vascular events will be stratified according to IBD phenotype, disease activity (clinical, radiologic and endoscopic) and main comorbidities at baseline., 4 to 7.5 years
Number of SAE declared by patients (cancer, serious infections, arterial and venous thrombotic events), To assess the presence and the extent of safety concerns in patients treated with JAKi, anti-IL23p19, and S1p modulators for each outcome of interest separately

* Cancer
* Serious infections
* Arterial thrombotic events
* Venous thrombotic events, 4 to 7.5 years|Treatment impact on IBD natural history, To investigate prospectively the impact of JAKi, anti-IL23p19 and S1p modulators strategies on the natural history of IBD and their potential for disease modification by collecting validated surrogate markers such as mucosal healing and disease complications such as bowel damage (strictures, fistulas, abscess), surgeries, and hospitalizations, 4 to 7.5 years|ePRO, To assess the evolution of ePROs on a trimester basis and the impact of JAKi, anti-IL23p19, and S1p modulators on ePROs in IBD, 4 to 7.5 years|Benefit-risk ratio, To evaluate the benefit-risk ratio of strategies based on a wider use of JAKi, anti-IL23p19, and S1p modulators therapy for IBD, 4 to 7.5 years|Number and duration of hospitalization, surgery, endoscopy and other imaging, To assess the healthcare costs and cost-efficacy of current therapeutic strategies in IBD., 4 to 7.5 years
Number of patients : 6 000 at least Participating investigators : 250 at least

Recruitment period : 3 years 6 months

Primary objective : to assess prospectively the presence and the extent of safety concerns (cancer, serious infections, arterial and venous thrombotic events) in patients with CD and UC and treated with JAKi, anti-IL23p19, and S1p modulators.

Secondary objectives :

* To assess the presence and the extent of safety concerns in patients treated with JAKi, anti-IL23p19, and S1p modulators for each outcome of interest separately (cancer, serious infections, arterial thrombotic events, venous thrombotic events)
* To investigate prospectively the impact of JAKi, anti-IL23p19 and S1p modulators strategies on the natural history of IBD and their potential for disease modification by collecting validated surrogate markers such as mucosal healing and disease complications such as bowel damage (strictures, fistulas, abscess), surgeries, and hospitalizations
* To assess the evolution of ePROs on a trimester basis and the impact of JAKi, anti-IL23p19, and S1p modulators on ePROs in IBD
* To evaluate the benefit-risk ratio of strategies based on a wider use of JAKi, anti-IL23p19, and S1p modulators therapy for IBD
* To assess the healthcare costs and cost-efficacy of current therapeutic strategies in IBD.
