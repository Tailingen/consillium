A Study to Evaluate Mezigdomide, Bortezomib and Dexamethasone (MEZIVd) Versus Pomalidomide, Bortezomib and Dexamethasone (PVd) in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma (RRMM)
The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of mezigdomide (CC-92480), bortezomib and dexamethasone (MeziVd) versus pomalidomide, bortezomib and dexamethasone (PVd) in participants with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) who received between 1 to 3 prior lines of therapy and who have had prior lenalidomide exposure.
Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: mezigdomide|DRUG: Pomalidomide|DRUG: Bortezomib|DRUG: Dexamethasone
Progression-free Survival (PFS), From date of randomization to date of disease progression or death due to any cause (Up to approximately 5 years)
Recommended mezigdomide dose, Stage 1 only, Up to 12 Months|Plasma concentrations of mezigdomide, Stage 1 only, Up to 134 Days|Overall Survival (OS), From date of randomization to date of death due to any cause (Up to approximately 5 years)|Overall Response (OR), OR is defined as the number of participants who achieve best response of partial response (PR) or better according to the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma, Up to approximately 5 years|Complete Response (CR) or better, Defined as the number of participants who achieve best response of complete response (CR) or better according to the IMWG Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma, Up to approximately 5 Years|Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) or better, Defined as the number of participants who achieve best response of very good partial response (VGPR) or better according to the IMWG Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma, Up to approximately 5 years|Time to Response (TTR), Up to approximately 5 years|Duration of Response (DOR), Up to approximately 5 years|Time to Progression (TTP), Up to approximately 5 years|Time to Next Treatment (TTNT), Up to approximately 5 years|Progression-free Survival 2 (PFS-2), Up to approximately 5 years|Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) negativity, Defined as the number of participants who achieve complete response (CR) or better and MRD negativity (defined as less than 1 in 10\^5 nucleated cells \[by next generation flow cytometry\] in bone marrow aspirate), Up to approximately 5 years|Number of participants with Adverse Events (AEs), Up to approximately 5 years|Change from baseline in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer - Quality of Life C30 questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) scores, The EORTC QLQ-C30 is the most commonly used quality of life instrument in oncology trials. The QLQ-C30 consists of 30 questions incorporated into 5 functional domains physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 9 symptom/other scales (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties), and a single global Quality of Life (QoL)/global health status score. Items in the functional and symptom scale use raw participant response of 1 to 4, where 1 = "not at all" and 4 = "very much." The 2 global items contain responses ranging from 1 "very poor" to 7 "excellent." The recall period is 1 week. All domain scores are transformed in a range from 0 to 100, where a higher functional score indicates more favorable outcomes and a higher score on the symptom domains indicates a less favorable participant outcome. Stage 2 only., Up to approximately 5 years|Change from baseline in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer - Quality of Life Multiple Myeloma Module (EORTC QLQ-MY20) score, The EORTC QLQ-MY20 is a 20-item myeloma module intended for use among participants varying in disease stage and treatment modality. Participants rate symptoms or problems on a scale from 1 to 4 where 1 = "not at all" and 4 = "very much." Stage 2 only., Up to approximately 5 years
