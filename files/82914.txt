Dose Finding Study of Zanzalintinib With Pembrolizumab and Cetuximab in Head and Neck SCC
This Phase I clinical trial evaluates the safety, tolerability, and optimal dosing of Zanzalintinib in combination with Pembrolizumab and Cetuximab in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (R/M HNSCC). The study aims to establish the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) while also exploring efficacy outcomes, including progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).

Maximally Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Zanzalintinib in Combination with Pembrolizumab and Cetuximab, The MTD will be defined as the dose combination with a dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) rate closest to the target DLT rate of 25%., end of DLT evaluation period (first 28 days of treatment)|Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) of Zanzalintinib in Combination with Pembrolizumab and Cetuximab, The RP2D will be defined as the MTD identified after enrollment to all cohorts., End of enrollment
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), The secondary outcome measure of Progression-Free Survival (PFS) will assess the time from the first dose of the study drug (Zanzalintinib, Pembrolizumab, and Cetuximab) to the date of documented disease progression (PD) based on RECIST v1.1 or death, whichever occurs first. This measure will help evaluate the efficacy of the combination therapy in delaying disease progression in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck., 2 years from the date of the final subject accrual on study|Overall Survival (OS), The secondary outcome measure of Overall Survival (OS) will evaluate the time from the first dose of the study drug (Zanzalintinib, Pembrolizumab, and Cetuximab) to the date of death from any cause. This outcome will help assess the overall impact of the combination therapy on patient survival in recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck., 2 years from the date of the final subject accrual on study|Safety of zanzalintinib in combination with pembrolizumab and cetuximab, Adverse events (AEs) leading to discontinuation or death, and severity of AEs will be assessed by National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), version 5.0., End of treatment (about 24 months on average)
This Phase I, single-site clinical trial investigates the combination therapy of Zanzalintinib, an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor, with Pembrolizumab, an anti-PD1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, and Cetuximab, an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody, in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (R/M HNSCC). The primary objective is to determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of Zanzalintinib in combination with Pembrolizumab and Cetuximab.

Secondary objectives include evaluating safety, tolerability, objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Exploratory objectives will investigate the effects of the treatment on plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) levels, immune phenotype, genetic alterations, and histopathologic changes in tumor biopsies.

The trial uses a dose-escalation design, with a 42-day treatment cycle, to assess safety and dose-limiting toxicities. This combination targets the immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment, aiming to overcome resistance mechanisms and improve clinical outcomes for a population with limited therapeutic options.
