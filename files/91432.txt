Studying RNA in Samples From Younger Patients With T-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer

PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking into RNA in samples from younger patients with T-cell (T) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

Identification and characterization of IncRNA of pediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia
OBJECTIVES:

* Characterization of the transcriptomic landscape in diagnosis and relapse of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and the direct comparison with corresponding physiological samples (human thymus).
* Perform high-throughput transcriptome ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing using matched diagnostic T-precursor pediatric ALL samples (peripheral blood or bone marrow).

OUTLINE: Archived peripheral blood and bone marrow samples are analyzed for long non-coding RNA (IncRNA) expression and sequencing.
