PM534 Administered Intravenously to Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
The goals of this trial are to identify the dose limiting toxicities, to determine the maximum tolerated dose and the recommended dose of PM534 in patients with advanced solid tumors. All Patients will receive PM534 via intravenous.
Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: PM534
Determination of the Maximum Tolerated Dose and the Recommended Dose, A fully evaluable patient is a patient evaluable for the primary objective (i.e., determination of the MTD and the RD)., From the date of first infusion of PM534 to the date of study termination, up to 27 months
Safety AEs of PM534, AEs will be graded according to the NCI-CTCAE v.5., From the date of first infusion of PM534 to the date of study termination, up to 27 months|Safety Hb of PM534, Parameters Labs will be graded according to the NCI-CTCAE v.5., From the date of first infusion of PM534 to the date of study termination, up to 27 months|Safety neutrophils of PM534, Parameters Labs will be graded according to the NCI-CTCAE v.5., From the date of first infusion of PM534 to the date of study termination, up to 27 months|Safety platelets of PM534, Parameters Labs will be graded according to the NCI-CTCAE v.5., From the date of first infusion of PM534 to the date of study termination, up to 27 months|Safety BT of PM534, Parameters Labs will be graded according to the NCI-CTCAE v.5., From the date of first infusion of PM534 to the date of study termination, up to 27 months|Safety ALT/AST of PM534, Parameters Labs will be graded according to the NCI-CTCAE v.5., From the date of first infusion of PM534 to the date of study termination, up to 27 months|Safety ALK of PM534, Parameters Labs will be graded according to the NCI-CTCAE v.5., From the date of first infusion of PM534 to the date of study termination, up to 27 months|Safety creatinine of PM534, Parameters Labs will be graded according to the NCI-CTCAE v.5., From the date of first infusion of PM534 to the date of study termination, up to 27 months|QT Assessment, The direct relationship between PM534 plasma concentration C and the change from baseline in QT corrected according to Fridericia's formula (Î”QTcF) will be assessed using linear mixed effects (LME) models., During Day of Cycle 1 (each cycle lasts 21 days)|Pharmacokinetics Cmax of PM534, Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax). Pharmacokinetic analyses will be evaluated in plasma and urine by standard noncompartmental analysis. Compartmental modeling may be performed if appropriate., Cycle 1 from all patients, and also in Cycle 2 from treated patients once the MTD has been determined(each cycle is 21 days).|Pharmacokinetics AUC of PM534, Area Under The Concentration-time Curve (AUC). Pharmacokinetic analyses will be evaluated in plasma and urine by standard noncompartmental analysis. Compartmental modeling may be performed if appropriate., Cycle 1 from all patients, and also in Cycle 2 from treated patients once the MTD has been determined(each cycle is 21 days).|Pharmacogenomics Plasma AUC(0-t) of PM534, To analyze the expression levels of Plasma AUC(0-t) of response and/or resistance to treatment with PM534, Cycle 1 from all patients, and also in Cycle 2 from patients treated once the MTD has been determined) (each cycle is 21 days)|Pharmacogenomics Plasma Cmax of PM534, To analyze the expression levels of Plasma Cmax of response and/or resistance to treatment with PM534, Cycle 1 from all patients, and also in Cycle 2 from patients treated once the MTD has been determined) (each cycle is 21 days)|Pharmacogenomics Plasma half life of PM534, To analyze the expression levels of Plasma half life of response and/or resistance to treatment with PM534, Cycle 1 from all patients, and also in Cycle 2 from patients treated once the MTD has been determined) (each cycle is 21 days)|Pharmacogenomics Total body plasma clearance of PM534, To analyze the expression levels of Total body plasma clearance of response and/or resistance to treatment with PM534, Cycle 1 from all patients, and also in Cycle 2 from patients treated once the MTD has been determined) (each cycle is 21 days)|Pharmacogenomics Volume of distribution of PM534, To analyze the expression levels of Volume of distribution of response and/or resistance to treatment with PM534, Cycle 1 from all patients, and also in Cycle 2 from patients treated once the MTD has been determined) (each cycle is 21 days)|Pharmacogenomics Percentage of dose recovered in urine of PM534, To analyze the expression levels of Percentage of dose recovered in urine of response and/or resistance to treatment with PM534, Cycle 1 from all patients, and also in Cycle 2 from patients treated once the MTD has been determined) (each cycle is 21 days)|Efficacy of PM534, To analyze the response rates will be determined in patients with measurable or evaluable disease specific tumor types, time-to-event parameter will also be analyzed ORR., From the date of first infusion of PM534 to the date of study termination, up to 27 months
This is a prospective, open-label, dose-escalating phase I study in patients with advanced solid tumors. Patients will be included in cohorts of a minimum of three or six patients to receive PM534 at successively increasing dose levels.
