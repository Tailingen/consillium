Microwave Ablation for Treatment of Small Renal Tumors and Primary and Secondary Liver Neoplasms
The goal of this observational study is to collect data on efficacy and safety of microwave ablation (MWA) used to treat subjects with primary and secondary liver malignancies and renal malignancies. The main question it aims to evaluate the short, medium and long-term clinical course of patients treated with MWA.

Participants will not alter their normal clinical and therapeutic practice, due to the observational nature of the study, and all data regarding microwave treatments will be collected (including demographic data). follow their normal clinical and therapeutic path

PROCEDURE: Microwave ablation (MWA)
Local Tumor Progression Free Survival, Based on imaging evidence of tumor reccurence at site of ablation (within 5mm of ablation margins), From date of ablation until death from any cause; evaluated up to 5 years|Time to Local Progression, Time from ablation to imaging evidence of tumor reccurence at site of ablation (within 5mm of ablation margins), From date of ablation until death from any cause; evaluated up to 5 years
Overall Survival (OS), From date of ablation until death for any cause, From date of ablation until death from any cause; evaluated up to 5 years|Progression Free Survival (PFS), From date of ablation until any documented evidence of tumor progression at any site, From date of ablation until death from any cause; evaluated up to 5 years|Organ specific Progression Free Survival (PFS), From date of ablation until any documented evidence of tumor progression at the ablated organ (including reccurence at ablation site), From date of ablation until death from any cause; evaluated up to 5 years
Observational, retrospective and prospective, monocentric study. The objective is to evaluate the short, medium and long-term clinical course of patients undergoing microwave ablation (MWA) for small renal tumors and primary and secondary liver neoplasms. Evaluation of clinical efficacy (progression free survival),safety and technical outcome of microwave ablation as well as clinical outcome of the procedure will be evaluated.At the end of the follow-up periods, the data collected will be compared with those available in the literature on MWA, cryoablation (CA), radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and surgical resection.
