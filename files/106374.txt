Avelumab With Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy in Adults With Isocitrate Dehydrogenase (IDH) Mutant Glioblastoma
The purpose of this study is to test how safe and effective treatment with the combination of Avelumab and radiation is for IDH mutant gliomas that have transformed to glioblastoma after chemotherapy.
Glioblastoma
BIOLOGICAL: Avelumab|RADIATION: Hypofractionated radiation therapy (HFRT)
Number of Dose Limiting Toxicities, Subjects are evaluable for DLTs (defined in section 5.2.1.2) if they have received at least one dose of Avelumab, have completed HFRT per protocol and have completed safety assessments over the entire DLT evaluation period (days 1 through 28)., Day 28|Median Progression-free Survival (PFS6), PFS, defined as the time between treatment initiation and first occurrence of disease progression or death, will be censored at last follow-up if the patient remained alive without disease progression, Month 6
Median Overall Survival (OS), OS will be determined from the time of treatment initiation until the time of death, with OS being censored at last follow-up if the patient remained alive, Month 12|Median Progression-free Survival (PFS12), PFS, defined as the time between treatment initiation and first occurrence of disease progression or death, will be censored at last follow-up if the patient remained alive without disease progression, Month 12
The active pharmaceutical ingredient in Avelumab (MSB0010718C) is a fully human antibody of the immunoglobulin gamma-1 (IgG1) isotype that specifically targets and blocks the Programmed death-ligand 1(PD-L1) for Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1).

Avelumab binds PD-L1 and blocks the interaction between PD-L1 and PD-1. This removes the suppressive effects of PD-L1 on anti-tumor cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8)+ T cells, resulting in the restoration of cytotoxic T cell response.
