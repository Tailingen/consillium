Efficacy and Safety of Lenvatinib as a Conversion Therapy for HCC
Lenvatinib is the standard of care for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of the single-arm, open-label, phase II clinical trial is to assess efficacy and safety of lenvatinib as a preoperative conversion therapy in patients with potentially resectable HCC. Investigator hypothesized that lenvatinib may be an effective conversion treatment for HCC, and preoperative treatment with lenvatinib can improve resectability in patients with potential resectable HCC and improve the long term survival.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)
DRUG: Lenvatinib 4 mg Oral
Resection rate, The percentage of patients who receive curative liver resection for HCC. The criteria for curative resection: (1) no active tumor thrombosis is observed in hepatic veins, portal veins, bile ducts or inferior vena cava; or the type of portal vein invasion was converted from Vp3/Vp4 to Vp1/Vp2; (2) no active metastasis to adjacent organs or distant organs, or to lymph nodes; (3) the surgical margin ≥ 0.5 cm; (4) the number of active tumor nodules decreases from ≥4 to \<4; (5) the ratio of future liver volume to standard liver volume increases from \<40% to ≥40% (for those with liver cirrhosis) or from \<30% to ≥30% (for those without liver cirrhosis)., 1 year after LPI
Overall survival (OS), The duration from the date of recruitment to the date of death from any cause., 3 years|Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who have a confirmed complete response (CR: disappearance of all target lesions) or partial response (PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters), 1 year after LPI|Serum Biomarkers, To explore the relationship between the baseline level and dynamic changes of serum markers(AFP and PIVKA-II) and therapeutic response, Peripheral blood serum was collected at baseline and at each follow-up visit., 1 year after LPI|Adverse events(AE) and Serious adverse events(SAE), An adverse event (AE) refers to any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, but which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.

A serious adverse event (SAE) refers to an event in clinical trials that requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of existing hospitalization, permanent disability, incapacity, threats to life or death, and birth defect, etc.

Number and classification of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0 were recorded., 1 year after LPI|Health-related quality of life: EORTC QLQ-HCC18, Health-related quality of life questionnaire measured by EORTC QLQ-HCC18., 1 year after LPI|Exploratory serum biomarker research, About 10 mL peripheral blood will be collected at baseline and at each follow-up visit. The correlations between serum biomarkers at baseline or the dynamic changes and treatment response will be analyzed., 1 year after LPI
For patients with potentially resectable HCC (intermediate or advanced stage), upfront therapy with surgical resection is of high recurrence rate after surgery. The aim of the single-arm, open-label, prospective phase II clinical trial is to evaluate whether preoperative lenvatinib treatment could improve resectability and therefore improve the long term survival.

Participants who are recruited in this study in this study will be treated with lenvatinib and will be evaluated for the feasibility for surgical resection by a multidisciplinary team every 8 weeks. If the participants underwent curative resection, they will receive lenvatinib treatment for 48 weeks after surgery.
