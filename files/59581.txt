Sym013 (Pan-HER) in Patients With Advanced Epithelial Malignancies
This is the first study to test Sym013 (Pan-HER) in humans. The primary purpose of this study is to see if Sym013 is safe and effective for patients with advanced epithelial malignancies without available therapeutic options.
Oncology
DRUG: Sym013
Part 1: Assess the Safety and Tolerability of Sym013 When Administered Either Q1W or Q2W to Separate Dose-escalation Cohorts of Patients., Assess the occurrence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) during Cycle 1 of Sym013 administration., 24 months|Part 2: Evaluate the Antitumor Effect of Sym013 When Administered at the RP2D and Regimen to Patients., No data were collected for this Outcome Measures as Part 2 of the trial was never initiated., 24 months
Part 1: Determine the RP2D and Regimen of Sym013., No RP2D or regimen of Sym013 was determined as the trial was prematurely terminated, 24 months|Parts 1 and 2: Evaluate the Immunogenicity of Sym013., Serum sampling to assess the potential for anti-drug antibody (ADA) formation was not analyzed as the trial was prematurely terminated, 42 months|Parts 1 and 2: Area Under the Concentration-time Curve Extrapolated to Infinity (AUC)., Will be estimated using non-compartmental methods and actual time points., 0, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, 168 hours and 336 hours if Q2W|Parts 1 and 2: Maximum Concentration (Cmax) and Trough Concentration (Ctrough) - Mean Values., Will be derived from observed data., 0, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, 168 hours and 336 hours if Q2W|Parts 1 and 2: Time to Reach Maximum Concentration (Tmax)., Will be derived from observed data. End of infusion was defined as time zero (0), 0, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, 168 hours and 336 hours if Q2W|Parts 1 and 2: Elimination Half-life (TÂ½)., Will be estimated using non-compartmental methods and actual time points, 0, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, 168 hours and 336 hours if Q2W|Parts 1 and 2: Clearance (CL)., Will be estimated using non-compartmental methods and actual time points., 0, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, 168 hours and 336 hours if Q2W
This is an open-label, multicenter trial composed of 2 parts in which Sym013 will be evaluated when administered by intravenous infusion in patients with advanced epithelial malignancies without available therapeutic options.

Part 1 is a Phase 1a dose-escalation evaluating weekly (Q1W) and every second week (Q2W) schedules of administration in separate dose-escalation cohorts to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and regimen of Sym013.

Part 2 is a Phase 2a dose-expansion at the RP2D and regimen. Four (4) dose-expansion cohorts will be evaluated in this part of the trial and will be selected based upon findings from Part 1, additional preclinical data, and additional clinical data available at that time from other agents inhibiting these targets. Patients will be entered, depending upon either a defined molecular profile or profiles, or their underlying malignancy, to 1 of 4 corresponding expansion cohorts: Cohort A, Cohort B, Cohort C, or Cohort D.
