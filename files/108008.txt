Incidence of adverse events, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigational subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment., Through 1 month following last dose; up to approximately 2 years|Incidence of laboratory abnormalities, To be summarized using descriptive statistics., Through 1 month following last dose; up to approximately 2 years|Incidence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), Through 3 weeks after first dose
Blood concentrations of LV and metabolites, Through 3 weeks after dosing; up to approximately 2 years|Incidence of antitherapeutic antibodies, Through 1 month following last dose; up to approximately 2 years|Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST v1.1., Through 1 month following last dose; up to approximately 2 years|Duration of response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from start of the first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR) to the first documentation of tumor progression (clinical progression or progressive disease (PD) per RECIST v1.1)., Up to approximately 3 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from start of study treatment to first documentation of tumor progression (clinical progression or PD per RECIST v1.1)., Up to approximately 8 years|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from start of study treatment to date of death due to any cause., Up to approximately 8 years|PFS relative to prior therapy, The PFS ratio is defined for each subject as the ratio of the current PFS and the PFS achieved on their most recent therapy where they experienced progression., Up to approximately 8 years
