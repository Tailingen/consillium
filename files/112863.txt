Expanded Access Study of Fenretinide Lym-X-Sorb Plus Ketoconazole in Neuroblastoma
Currently there is no known effective treatment for recurrent/resistant neuroblastoma.

Fenretinide is an anticancer agent that may work differently than standard chemotherapy medicines. It may cause the buildup of wax-like substances in neuroblastoma cancer cells, called "ceramides" or other chemicals, called 'reactive oxygen species'. In laboratory studies it was found that if too much ceramide or reactive oxygen species build up in neuroblastoma cells, they may die.

In addition, researchers are testing to see if a drug called ketoconazole, commonly used to treat fungus infections, can increase fenretinide levels in the body by interfering with the body's ability to break down fenretinide.

This study is being done: 1) to allow patients with recurrent/refractory neuroblastoma patients who would otherwise not be able to access fenretinide/LXS oral powder for treatment to do so; 2) to further describe the side effects of fenretinide and ketoconazole when given by mouth for seven days every three weeks; 3) to determine if a patient's tumor gets smaller after treatment with fenretinide oral powder plus ketoconazole or fenretinide oral powder alone.
