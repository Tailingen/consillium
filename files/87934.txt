A Randomized Phase 2 Study of Erlotinib + ARQ 197 Versus Erlotinib + Placebo in Previously Treated Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind phase 2 study designed to compare treatment with ARQ 197 plus erlotinib to erlotinib plus placebo in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. The study will enroll patients who have had one prior chemotherapy regimen (other than erlotinib) for NSCLC.

DRUG: ARQ 197|DRUG: Erlotinib|DRUG: Placebo
Evaluate progression free survival (PFS) in patients treated with erlotinib plus ARQ 197 versus erlotinib plus placebo
Evaluate overall survival (OS)|Overall response rate (ORR)|Safety of ARQ 197 in combination with erlotinib in patients with NSCLC
This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind phase 2 study designed to compare treatment with ARQ 197 plus erlotinib to erlotinib plus placebo in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. The study will enroll patients who have had one prior chemotherapy regimen (other than erlotinib) for NSCLC. The study will evaluate progression-free survival between the two arms.

A total of 154 patients will be enrolled.
