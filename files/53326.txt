A Phase 2 Study of Viagenpumatucel-L (HS-110) in Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
Determine whether viagenpumatucel-L combined with low-dose cyclophosphamide prolongs survival in patients with NSCLC who failed 2 or 3 prior lines of therapy for incurable or metastatic disease compared with chemotherapy alone.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Viagenpumatucel-L|DRUG: Metronomic Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Physician's Choice Regimen (Vinorelbine, Erlotinib, Gemcitabine, Paclitaxel, Docetaxel, Pemetrexed)
Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) calculated as the duration of survival from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause, or was censored on the date the patient was last known to be alive.

Survival time was calculated from the randomization date up to the date of death,or censored on the date that the patient was last known to be alive (last available visit date) utilizing Kaplan-Meier Estimate of Overall Survival Ending Events, Up to 3 years
Frequency of Adverse Events: Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE), Evaluate the safety of the combination of viagenpumatucel-L and low-dose cyclophosphamide by frequency of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, Up to 3 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Evaluate overall immune-related DCR (irDCR) and also DCR by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (complete response, partial response, and stable disease), Up to 3 years|6-Month Disease Control Rate (6mDCR), Evaluate 6-month immune-related DCR (6m-irDCR) and also 6mDCR by RECIST (complete response, partial response, and stable disease at 6 months following randomization), 6 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR), Evaluate immune-related ORR (irORR) and also ORR by RECIST (complete response and partial response), Up to 3 years|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Evaluate immune-related PFS (irPFS) and PFS by RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors), Up to 3 years|Time to Progression (TTP), Evaluate immune-related TTP (irTTP) and also TTP (Time to Progression) by RECIST, Up to 3 years|Survival at 6 Months, Evaluate the proportion of patients who are alive at 6 months following randomization, 6 months|Survival at 12 Months, Evaluate the proportion of patients who are alive at 12 months following randomization, 12 months|Immune Response, Characterize the peripheral blood immunologic response via intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) by flow cytometry and/or enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) on cluster of differentiation 8 positive (CD8+) cells following vaccination, Up to 3 years
This study will test whether vaccination with viagenpumatucel-L combined with low-dose cyclophosphamide will prolong the survival of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have failed 2 or 3 prior lines of therapy for incurable or metastatic disease compared with chemotherapy alone. Patients will be randomized 2 to 1 into the viagenpumatucel-L arm and the chemotherapy alone arm, respectively.
