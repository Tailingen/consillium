PH I SRC Kinase, Dasatinib Combo Paclitaxel & Carboplatin in Pts w Ovarian, Peritoneal, & Tubal Cancer
Primary objective to determine the maximal tolerated (MTD) of dasatinib in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin during the first cycle of treatment.

Secondary objectives to describe the toxicity of this combination of therapy; to describe the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics parameters related to this combination; to describe the clinical activity as defined as the response rate (complete and partial response rate) and progression-free survival \> 6 month; to compare the SRC pathway microarray signature in pre and post-treatment cancer specimens; to evaluate SRC pathway downstream substrates, FAX, paxcillin, and CRK-L in pre and post-treatment cancer specimens.

This is a phase I multicenter study designed to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) and toxicity of dasatinib in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin during the first cycle of treatment in patients with advanced or recurrent ovarian, peritoneal, and tubal carcinoma. The MTD will be defined as the highest dose at which no more than 1 of 6 evaluable patient experiences a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) due to the combination of dasatinib, paclitaxel,and carboplatin during the first cycle of treatment.
