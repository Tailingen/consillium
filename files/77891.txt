Efficacy and Safety of Chidamide Combined With BEAM Pretreatment Regimen in Autologous Transplantation for T-cell Lymphoma
This single-center, single-arm clinical study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Chidamide combined with BEAM Pretreatment Regimen in ASCT treatment of TCL patients.
T Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Chidamide combined with BEAM
Progression free survival, Progression-free survival was defined as the time from the date of ASCT until the date of the first documented day of disease progression or relapse, using 2014 Lugano criteria, or death from an cause, whichever occurred first., Baseline up to data cut-off (up to approximately 2 years)
Overall survival, Overall survival was defined as the time from the date of ASCT to the date of death from any cause., Baseline up to data cut-off (up to approximately 2 years)|Complete remission rate, Percentage of participants with complete response was determined on 2014 Lugano criteria., 3 months after the transplantation|The time of hematopoietic reconstruction, The first day of neutrophils ≥0.5×109/L for 3 consecutive days was the time of successful implantation of granulocytes. Platelet ≥20.0×109/L for 7 consecutive days and the first day after platelet infusion was considered as the successful time of megakaryocytes implantation., 2 months after the transplantation|Transplantation-related adverse reactions, Transplantation-related adverse reactions are any untoward medical occurrence in a participant which is related to ASCT., Baseline up to data cut-off (up to approximately 4 years)
T cell lymphoma (TCL) is a group of highly heterogeneous aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas with different pathogenesis and clinical prognosis. Despite the survival benefits of Anthracycline-based chemotherapy bridging autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), 40% to 50% of TCL patients fail to respond to treatment and relapse or die within a short period of time. In 2021, a multicenter, single-arm, open Phase II trial of Chidamide combined with BEAC as a pretreatment regimen for ASCT of high-risk and relapsed/refractory lymphoma was presented at the ASH Meeting (NCT03629873). The results confirmed that Chidamide has a good prospect in ASCT. Chi-BEAC can increase 2Y-PFS from 55% to 93.3% and 2Y-OS from 58% to 94% in TCL patients after ASCT compared with the historical control group, with good tolerance.In order to provide a new program for improving survival rate, this single-center, single-arm clinical study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Chidamide combined with BEAM Pretreatment Regimen in ASCT treatment of TCL patients.
