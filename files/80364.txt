Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) Self-collection and Women Adherence
Despite declining mortality in high-income countries, cervical cancer continues to be a public health problem in low and middle -income countries. HPV tests have shown a better sensibility and a higher capacity of reducing mortality than cytology based-screening. Greater participation has been demonstrated with the use of HPV self-testing when it is offered to women with a poor screening history; however, it is not clear whether getting tested necessarily translates into a greater adherence to the entire clinical protocol, including diagnosis and treatment of precancerous lesions. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of the self-testing techniques on the participation and adherence of women to cervical cancer screening.

Participation, Number of women that undergo the screening test / total number of women invited., 1 year|Adherence, Number of women that undergo the screening test + women who completed the diagnosis and treatment process / total number of women invited + total number of women with a positive screening in follow-up protocols., 1 year
Quality of HPV samples, Number of samples suitable for analysis / Total number of samples, 1 year|CIN2 + rate in the study population, Number of CIN2 + diagnosed / total women screened, 1 year|CIN2 + rate in population with positive screening, Number of CIN2 + diagnosed / total of women positive at screening, 1 year
The investigators will perform a randomized clinical trial with three arms including: regular HPV with cytology triage, colpo/biopsy, and treatment if indicated; HPV self-collection without cytology triage but with colpo/biopsy and treatment if indicated, HPV self-collection with immediate treatment for women with positive test results. This study will be carried out in two different settings with differential access to diagnosis and treatment. Two methods will be used for inviting women and collecting samples: mail and door-to-door. Participation (screening uptake) and adherence to the clinical protocol (compliance with diagnosis and treatment) will be evaluated.
