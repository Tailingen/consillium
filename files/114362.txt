Venetoclax to Improve Outcomes of Fractionated Busulfan Regimen in Patients With High-Risk AML and MDS
This phase II trial studies the effect of venetoclax together with busulfan, cladribine, and fludarabine in treating patients with high-risk acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome who are undergoing stem cell transplant. Chemotherapy drugs, such as venetoclax, busulfan, cladribine, and fludarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Adding venetoclax to the current standard of care stem cell transplant regimen of busulfan, fludarabine, and cladribine may help to control high-risk acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia|Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia|Myelodysplastic Syndrome
DRUG: Busulfan|DRUG: Cladribine|DRUG: Fludarabine Phosphate|PROCEDURE: Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation|DRUG: Thiotepa|DRUG: Venetoclax
1-year progression free survival (PFS), The proportion of patients who are alive without disease relapse (PFS) at one year will be reported along with the corresponding 95% credible interval. Cox proportional hazards regression will be used to assess the association between PFS and clinical and treatment covariates of interest., At 1 year post-transplant
Overall survival (OS), OS will be calculated from the time of transplant by the method of Kaplan and Meier., Up to 3 years post-transplant|Graft-versus (vs.)-host disease-free, relapse-free survival (GRFS), GRFS will be calculated from the time of transplant by the method of Kaplan and Meier., Up to 3 years post-transplant|Time to platelet engraftment, The time to platelet engraftment will be calculated from the time of transplant and estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method., From the time of transplant up to 3 years|Time to neutrophil engraftment, The time to neutrophil engraftment will be calculated from the time of transplant and estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method., From the time of transplant up to 3 years|Incidence of acute and chronic graft-vs.-host disease (GvHD), The cumulative incidence of acute and chronic GvHD with the competing risks of relapse and death will be estimated using the method of Gooley, and the method of Fine and Gray will be used to model the association between both parameters and clinical and treatment characteristics of interest., Up to 3 years post-transplant|Incidence of relapse and non-relapse mortality, The cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality and relapse will also be assessed in a competing risks framework, with similar analyses performed., Up to 3 years post-transplant|Incidence of adverse events, Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize adverse events. The number and proportion of subjects with treatment emergent adverse events will be reported. All other safety parameters will be summarized using descriptive statistics or frequency counts. Graphical summaries will be used where appropriate., Up to 3 years post-transplant
Phase 2 Portion

Primary Objective 1) To obtain preliminary evidence of efficacy as defined by 1-year progression free survival.

Secondary Objectives

To determine:

1. Safety of this regimen as per NCI toxicity criteria
2. Time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment
3. Incidence of acute and chronic GVHD
4. Relapse incidence
5. Non-relapse mortality
6. Overall survival
7. Graft versus host disease-relapse free survival (GRFS)

Phase 3 Portion

Primary Objective

1) To compare progression free survival between two arms Arm 1 Standard of Care: fludarabine + IV busulfan (FluBu) versus Arm 2 Experimental: Venetoclax + Fractionated busulfan, cladribine, and fludarabine

Secondary Objectives To compare following between two arms

1. Safety of this regimen as per NCI toxicity criteria
2. Time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment
3. Incidence of acute and chronic GVHD
4. Relapse incidence
5. Non-relapse mortality
6. Overall survival
7. Graft versus host disease-relapse free survival (GRFS)
