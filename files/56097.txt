Anti-tumor Effect of Ixabepilone in Metastatic Breast Cancer (mBC) Selected by the Ixabepilone DRP.
The purpose is to investigate anti-tumor effect of ixabepilone in patients with locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer (mBC) selected by the Ixabepilone DRP after failure of an anthracycline and taxanes.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Ixabepilone Injection
Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), To evaluate the clinical benefit rate of ixabepilone using tumor measurements (e.g. CT or MRI etc.). One-sided comparisons of CBR between treatment and historic control will be performed, and will be repeated for subgroups defined by ER status., 1 year
Progression free survival (PFS), PFS defined as time from inclusion until progressive disease(PD) according to RECIST v 1.0 or death of any reason, 1 year|Overall survival (OS), OS defined as time from inclusion until death, 1 year|Overall response rate (ORR) defined as CR + PR, Objective response rate (ORR) as defined as complete response (CR) + partial response (PR) according to RECIST v 1.0, 1 year|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events measured by NCI-CTCAE v.5.0, A description of the extent, duration and reversibility of ixabepilone elicited toxicity in target organs based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE v.5.0), 1 year|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) - fresh biopsy versus archival, Assess difference in prediction based on archival and fresh biopsy from same patient (percent agreement in binary prediction, and difference in primary and secondary endpoints with archival versus fresh biopsies), 1 year
Patients will be screened with the Ixabepilone DRP. If the tumor tissue has a DRP( Drug Response Prediction) score of \>67% (Belgium \>33%) the patient can be included in the clinical study. Ixabepilone 40 mg/m2 is administered as a 3-h intravenous infusion Day 1 in a 3-week cycle.
