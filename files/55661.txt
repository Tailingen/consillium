Precision Preoperative Embolization of Pelvic Tumors to Improve Surgical Outcomes
The main purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of precision preoperative embolization in decreasing operative blood loss, reducing surgical complications in pelvic tumor surgery. Furthermore the study aims at describing the vascularity in a series of pelvic tumors, and to correlate this with perioperative blood loss.
Embolization|Pelvic Tumor
PROCEDURE: Arteriography and precision preoperative embolization|PROCEDURE: Arteriography
Perioperative blood loss, Perioperative blood loss measured intraoperatively, Measured intraoperatively
Adverse events related to angiography or embolization, Including symptoms of nerve compression, pelvic organ ischemia injury, Within 2 postoperative days|Adverse events related to surgery, including poor wound healing，nerve injury，pelvic organ dysfunction, Within 30 postoperative days|Vascularization grade of pelvic tumors, it contains four grades：poor、moderate、rich、abundant, At the angiographic procedure prior to embolization performed 0-24 hours before surgery|postoperative blood loss, blood loss measured through the drainage within 2 postoperative days, Within 2 postoperative days
