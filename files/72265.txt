Weekly Versus Three-week Chemoradiation in Patients With Advanced Cervical Cancer
Three weekly cisplatin based chemoradiation is to be compared the compliance, toxicity, and response rates with the weekly cisplatin based chemoradiation in the treatment of locoregionally advanced cervical cancers.
Cervical Cancers
RADIATION: radiation|DRUG: weekly cisplatin|DRUG: tri-weekly cisplatin
compliance, 1. Percentage of completed cycles of scheduled chemotherapy in each arm
2. Percentage of grade III and IV toxicity
3. Delayed radiation time due to toxicity, 3 month
survival, 1. 5 year progression free survival
2. 5 year survival rate, 5 years
This study is to compare the compliance, toxicity, response and survival rate between concurrent chemoradiation with weekly cisplatin 40mg/m2 and three-week cisplatin 75mg/m2 in patients with advanced cervical cancer. Patients with primary untreated invasive squamous cell carcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma or adenocarcinoma of the cervix from stage IIB to IVA were enrolled. Patients with histologically proven locoregionally advanced cervical cancer will be randomized into two treatment arm; Arm I, concurrent chemoradiation with weekly cisplatin 40mg/m2 for six times; Arm II, concurrent chemoradiation with three-week cisplatin 75mg/m2 for three times. The compliance and toxicity during the chemoradiation is the primary endpoint. Response rate and the overall survival will be analyzed as secondary endpoints.
