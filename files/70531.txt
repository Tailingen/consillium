Clinical Evaluation of the PROGENSA(Registered Trademark) Prostate Cancer Gene 3 (PCA3) Assay in Men With a Previous Negative Biopsy Result
The objective of this multi-center clinical study is to determine the association of the PCA3 Score with prostate biopsy outcome and validate the assay's performance characteristics in men with previous negative prostate biopsies. An elevated PCA3 Score is thought to be associated with an increased likelihood of positive biopsy. The results of this study are intended to be used for regulatory filings for use as an in vitro diagnostic test.

Association of PCA3 Score With Prostate Biopsy Outcome (PCA3 Score Using Cutoff of 25.), The likelihood of positive biopsy was determined by the PCA3 Score expressed as a binary categorical variable: PCA3 Score \>=25 was positive, PCA3 Score \<25 was negative, At the time of biopsy
PCA3 is a gene that is highly over-expressed in more than 90% of prostate cancers, and that can be quantified in urine specimens following a digital rectal examination. Studies have shown that because PCA3 is highly specific for prostate cancer, it predicts the results of repeat biopsies more accurately than traditional prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing. Gen-Probe's PROGENSA(R) PCA3 assay is the first urine-based molecular diagnostic assay for prostate cancer.
