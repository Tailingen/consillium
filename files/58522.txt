Genetic Testing in Screening Patients With Metastatic or Unresectable Colon or Rectal Cancer for a COLOMATE Trial
This trial screens patients with colon or rectal cancer that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic) or cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable) for genetic mutations for recommendation to a molecularly assigned therapy. Identifying gene mutations may help patients enroll onto target companion trials that target these mutations.

OTHER: Genetic Testing
The Proportion of Patients Who Have an Actionable Genomic Profile, This is defined as a patient who received a trial recommendation per the COLOMATE companion trial recommendation form. Will be presented as a point estimate along with a 95% confidence interval (by Wald asymptotic confidence limit)., 6 months|Companion Trial Enrollment, This is defined as a patient who has an actionable genomic profile that enrolls in their recommended companion trial. Will be presented as a point estimate along with a 95% confidence interval (by Wald asymptotic confidence limit)., 3.5 years
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To perform blood-based genomic profiling on patients with treatment refractory metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) to facilitate accrual to molecularly assigned therapies.

II. To facilitate clinically annotated genomic analyses.

OUTLINE:

Patients submit blood samples for genetic testing.
