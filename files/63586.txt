Detection and differentiation of esophageal squamous neoplasia (ESN) are of value in improving patient outcomes.Optical enhancement technology can serves in the diagnosis of GI neoplasia. However, its performance in ESN has not yet been reported.The aims of the present study is:

1. To investigate the diagnosing value of optical enhancement technology for early esophageal squamous neoplasia.
2. To assess the detection rate of early esophageal squamous neoplasia by virtual chromoendoscopy with optical enhancement technology .
