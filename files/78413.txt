Efficacy Study of AvastinÂ® With Pemetrexed +/- Carboplatin to Treat Elderly Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
Multi-center, open, randomized (parallel) and comparative phase III.

Eligible patients will receive bevacizumab + chemotherapy for a minimum of 4 cycles followed by bevacizumab (+ pemetrexed, if appropriate) maintenance therapy until disease progression.

Arm A: Bevacizumab + pemetrexed

Arm B: Bevacizumab + pemetrexed + carboplatin
Non-squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Bevacizumab + Pemetrexed|DRUG: Bevacizumab + Pemetrexed + Carboplatin
Progression Free Survival, Progression free survival (defined as the number of days from the day of the first treatment until day of death (from any cause) or progression, whichever occurs earlier, or until the day of the last response assessment, if no progression or death (from any cause) is observed during the study)., 42 months
Overall Survival, Overall survival (defined as the number of days from the day of first treatment to death (from any cause), or until the last day if we know that the patient is alive)., 42 months
Primary:

* Proof of non-inferior efficacy of a monochemotherapy regimen of pemetrexed plus bevacizumab versus a combination chemotherapy regimen of pemetrexed-carboplatin plus bevacizumab in elderly patients(\> 65 years) as first-line treatment of advanced metastatic or recurrent non-squamous NSCLC by progression free survival

Secondary:

* To assess the efficacy of bevacizumab as measured by overall response rate and overall survival.
* To assess the safety of bevacizumab in combination with pemetrexed and pemetrexed and carboplatin.
* To assess quality of life by EORTC questionnaire QLQ-C30 and its lung cancer module LC-13
* To assess activity of daily life (iADL) in relation to ECOG performance status prior to study treatment
* To assess patient's outcome and treatment delivery in relation to the Charlson comorbidity score and the Simplified Comorbidity Score
