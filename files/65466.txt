Adult Double Cord Blood Transplant Study
The hypothesis of the study is double unit umbilical cord blood transplantation in adults will be associated with a one year survival rate of at least 40%.
Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation|Hematologic Malignancies
PROCEDURE: Cord blood transplantation
Measure overall survival of double unit UCBT in adult patients with hematologic malignancies, One year
Measure incidence of donor-derived neutrophil and platelet recovery, 100 Days|Measure contribution of each unit to initial and sustained engraftment, 2 years|Measure incidence and severity of acute graft-versus-host disease, 100 Days|Measure incidence and severity of chronic GVHD, 1 year|Measure incidence of transplant-related mortality, 6 months|Measure incidence of malignant relapse, 2 years|Measure incidence of serious infectious complications, 1 year|Measure incidence of immune reconstitution, 2 years|Measure probability of overall and disease-free survival, 2 years
The hypothesis of the study is double unit umbilical cord blood transplantation in adults will be associated with a one year survival rate of at least 40%.
