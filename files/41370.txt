Microbiotic Analysis in Digestive Endocrine Tumors
Incidence of digestive neuroendocrine tumors are increasing. Analysis of individual microbiota is a way to explore new neoplastic mechanisms, tumor identification and therapeutic orientations. This prospective pilot study aims to describe fecal bacterial phylogeny of patients with digestive neuroendocrine tumor.

Bacterial genomic signature will be recorded at initiation of Lanreotide treatment in naive patient with digestive neuroendocrine tumor (pancreas or small intestine), metastatic or locally advanced, as well as after one year follow up.
