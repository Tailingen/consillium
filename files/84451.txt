A Clinical Study of LM103 Injection in the Treatment of Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a single-arm, open-label, exploratory study to evaluate safety and efficacy of LM103 Injection in patients with advanced solid tumors. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability, antitumor activity and immunoreactivity.
Melanoma|Non Small Cell Lung Cancer|Cervical Carcinoma
DRUG: Autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs)
Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs), Adverse events are graded according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0, Up to 1 years
Number of Participants With Objective Response, Participants displaying objective response associated with the treatment regimen per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v.1.1). The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). The patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria., Up to 2 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR）, Percentage of patients that meet CR, PR and SD criteria set in this study according to RECIST v1.1：, Up to 2 years|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), The time length between TIL infusion and confirmed subsequent disease progression according to RECIST 1.1, Up to 2 years|The changes of the immunoreactivity during treatment, The changes from baseline of systemic immune Response markers: peripheral blood lymphocyte subtypes counts, cytokine, antigen-specific T-lymphocytes, Up to 2 years
This is an investigator initiated , single-arm, open-label ,exploratory study of LM103 Injection in patients with advanced solid tumors. Expanded TILs will be transferred to the patient after chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine. LM103 will be administered as a single dose on day 1. TIL transfer will be combined with IL-2 treatment. This study is planned to enroll 9-15 patients with advanced solid tumors.
