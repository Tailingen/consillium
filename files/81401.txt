To Predict Efficacy by Detecting Circulating Endothelial Cell Subsets and Blood Perfusion Parameters Changes in Vivo Tumor in the Phase II/III Study of Anlotinib in Patients With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
1. To reveal changes of peripheral markers and blood perfusion parameters in vivo tumor in the phase II study of anlotinib in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.
2. To clarify the meaning of peripheral markers and blood perfusion parameters in vivo tumor in predicting the effect of anti-angiogenic therapy.
