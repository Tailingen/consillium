Diagnosis of Cervical Lesions in Women With Unhealthy Looking Cervix
Endocervix (cervical canal) is the cavity of the cervix and connects the external os with the internal os. It is fusiform in shape and has posterior and anterior oblique longitudinal ridges, the plicae palmatae. These are not exactly apposed but inter-lock like a zipper so that the canal is kept closed.

The original squamous epithelium is clearly identified as a smooth, usually featureless covering of the cervix; its uniform pink color contrasts with the redness of the original columnar epithelium. It joins the latter at the original squamocolumnar junction.

Many clinicians encounter cervical lesions that may or may not be associated with cytologic abnormalities. Such abnormalities as ectropion, Nabothian cysts, and small cervical polyps are quite benign and need not generate concern for patient or clinician, whereas others, including those associated with a history of exposure to diethylstilbestrol, cervical inflammation, abnormal cervical cytology, and postcoital bleeding, should prompt additional evaluation. Further, in some patients, the cervix may be difficult to visualize. Several useful clinical suggestions for the optimal examination of the cervix are presented.
