Cyclophosphamide for Prevention of Graft-Versus-Host Disease After Allogeneic Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation in Patients With Hematological Malignancies
This phase II trial studies how well cyclophosphamide works in preventing chronic graft-versus-host disease after allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplant in patients with hematological malignancies. Giving chemotherapy and total-body irradiation before transplantation helps stop the growth of cancer cells and prevents the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. Healthy stem cells from a donor that are infused into the patient help the patient's bone marrow make blood cells; red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes, however, the transplanted donor cells can cause an immune response against the body's normal cells, which is called graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Giving cyclophosphamide after transplant may prevent this from happening or may make chronic GVHD less severe.

Chronic GVHD Requiring Systemic Immunosuppressive Treatment, Chronic GVHD will be defined by National Institutes of Health (NIH) criteria and requiring systemic treatment. A reduction in the cumulative incidence of GVHD from \~35% to \~15% at 1 year would represent a reasonable goal. A sample size of 42 patients provides 90% power to observe such a difference with one-side 5% type-1 error., At 1 year after transplantation
Donor Engraftment, Donor engraftment is defined as the count (percent) of patients with full donor chimerism. Full donor chimerism is defined as at least 95% donor CD3 cells in peripheral blood., At day 28|Grades II-IV and III-IV Acute GVHD, Grades II-IV and III-IV GVHD will be assessed with the use of cumulative incidence plots., Through day +100 post-transplant|Duration of Systemic Immunosuppressive Treatment, The need for additional immunosuppressive treatment with agents other than those used for prophylaxis, the reasons for their administration (acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, or other reasons) and the duration of its administration will be determined. Patients will be monitored to determine the duration of systemic immunosuppressive treatment. Primary and secondary treatment of acute GVHD and withdrawal of systemic immunosuppressive treatment will be assessed with the use of cumulative incidence plots., Up to 5 years|Persistent or Recurrent Malignancy After HCT, Recurrent or progressive malignancy will be assessed with the use of cumulative incidence plots. Recurrent malignancy will be defined by hematologic criteria. Recurrent malignancy will also be defined as any unplanned medical intervention designed to prevent progression of malignant disease in patients who have molecular, cytogenetic or flow-cytometric evidence of malignant cells after transplantation., At 2 years|Non-relapse Mortality, Defined as death in the absence of recurrent or progressive malignancy after HCT. Non-relapse morality will be assessed with the use of cumulative incidence plots. This secondary endpoint will be characterized and presented as a cumulative incidence., At 2 years|Overall Survival, Overall survival will be evaluated as Kaplan-Meier estimates., At 1 year post-transplant|Disease-free Survival, Disease-free survival will be evaluated as Kaplan-Meier estimates., At 1 year post-transplant|Hematologic Recovery, Descriptive statistics will be used to assess the median days of neutrophil and platelet recovery. The day of neutrophil recovery is defined as the first day of three consecutive lab values on different days, after the conditioning regimen-induced nadir of blood counts, that the absolute neutrophil count is \> 500/uL. The day of platelet recovery is defined as the first day of three consecutive lab values on different days, after the conditioning regimen-induced nadir of blood counts, that the platelet count is \>= 20,000/uL without platelet transfusion support in the seven days prior., Up to day +100|Graft Failure, Descriptive statistics will be used to assess the incidence of primary graft failure and secondary graft failure. Primary graft failure is defined as failure to achieve a sustained neutrophil count of \>= 500/uL by \>= 28 days post-transplant. Secondary graft failure is defined as the decline in neutrophil count to \< 500/uL after achieving engraftment which is unrelated to infection or drug effect and is unresponsive to stimulation by growth factors., By greater than or equal to 28 days post-transplant
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. The primary objective of this study is to assess outcomes when high-dose cyclophosphamide (CY) is administered on days 3 and 4 followed by cyclosporine (CSP) after human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched related or unrelated mobilized blood cell transplantation with total-body irradiation (TBI) or busulfan (BU)-based conditioning.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. The secondary objective of this study is to assess hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) outcomes when withdrawal of CSP is accelerated in patients without acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

OUTLINE: Patients' conditioning regimens are determined by the Clinical Coordinator after consultation with the attending physician. Based on disease, patients receive either TBI or fludarabine and busulfan.

PREPARATIVE REGIMEN: Patients receive TBI twice daily (BID) on days -4 or -3 to -1. Some patients also receive fludarabine intravenously (IV) daily on days -5 to -2 and busulfan IV over 3 hours once daily (QD) or over 2 hours every 6 hours on days -5 to -2. Patients may also undergo central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis, testicular irradiation, and/or involved field irradiation as per standard practice.

TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) on day 0 per standard practice.

GVHD PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1-2 hours on days 3-4. Patients also receive cyclosporine IV every 12 hours or every 8 hours beginning on day 5 with taper on days 56-126.

Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at day 180 and then annually for 5 years.
