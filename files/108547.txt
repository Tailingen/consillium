Safety of LEAD Radiotherapy Plus Chemoradiation in Patients With Bulky Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
The investigators aim to evaluate the safety of delivering a one-time single fraction of Lattice Extreme Ablative Dose (LEAD) radiotherapy followed one day later by standard-dose, conventionally fractionated concurrent chemotherapy and radiation delivered over 6 weeks in patients with bulky stage III non-small cell lung cancer in the setting of a single-arm phase I clinical trial. The investigators hypothesize that the addition of a one-time single fraction of LEAD radiation is safe and feasible, and will not result in additional toxicity above that expected with standard-dose concurrent chemotherapy and radiation alone.

Rate of Treatment-related Toxicity in Study Participants, Rate of treatment-related toxicity (serious adverse events, adverse events, etc.) in study participants. Toxicity will be assessed using NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. The two toxicities that will be monitored as primary endpoints are esophagitis and pneumonitis., Up to 12 months
Rate of Study Participants Achieving Complete or Partial Response Via CT RECIST Response Criteria, Number of subjects achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria on CT Scan:

* CR: Complete disappearance of all disease. No new lesions. No disease related symptoms. Normalization of markers and other abnormal lab values. All disease must be assessed using the same technique as baseline.
* PR: Greater than or equal to 30% decrease under baseline of the sum of longest diameters of all target measurable lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-measurable disease. No new lesions., Assessed up to 2 years|Rate of Study Participants Achieving Complete or Partial Response Via PET Response Criteria, Rate of subjects achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as detected by positron emission tomography (PET) Scan:

* CR is defined as no residual focal fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake or decrease in average FDG uptake by more than 80% in all tumor manifestations.
* PR is defined as standardized uptake value (SUV) decrease by 0 - 80%., Assessed up to 2 years|Rate of Loco-regional Failure in Study Participants, Rate of loco-regional failure in study participants. Loco-regional failure is defined as any evidence of disease progression within the primary primary tumor or regional lymph nodes, detected by any method., Assessed up to 2 years|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Rate of progression-free survival (PFS). PFS is defined as the length of time from date of treatment initiation until date of documented disease progression or death from any cause, with censoring of patients who are lost to follow-up., Assessed up to 2 years|Overall Survival (OS), Rate of overall survival (OS) in study participants. Overall survival is defined as the length of time from the date of treatment initiation until the date of death from any cause., Assessed up to 2 years
Paarticipants will receive a single fraction of LEAD radiation on day 1, followed one day later by conventionally fractionated concurrent chemoradiation consisting of 60 Gy of radiation delivered to involved sites of disease and a platinum doublet.

The investigational radiation treatment, a single fraction of LEAD radiation, is to be followed by conventionally fractionated radiation delivered concurrently with a standard chemotherapy regimen for stage III non-small cell lung cancer. The following day, patients will begin concurrent chemotherapy and radiation. Chemotherapy will be delivered under the management of the treating medical oncologist. Chemotherapy must be a platinum doublet. Carboplatin and cisplatin are both considered acceptable platinum agents. The use of cisplatin over carboplatin is strongly encouraged, unless the patient has a contraindication to cisplatin. The second agent will be at the discretion of the treating medical oncologist; in the current era, chemotherapy agents are tailored to each patient based on tumor histology, as well as comorbidities that dictate the tolerance of certain chemotherapeutic agents. Chemotherapy will be delivered concurrently throughout radiation therapy, beginning on day 2 of the treatment protocol and on the same day as the start of standard-dose radiation. Weekly regimens or regimens delivered every 3 weeks are acceptable. Additional cycles of consolidation chemotherapy are encouraged and will be given at the discretion of the treating medical oncologist.
