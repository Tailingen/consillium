A Study of LY2228820 in Participants With Advanced Cancer
The objective of this study is to determine a safe dose of LY2228820 that may be given to participants with advanced cancer. Part A of this study will consist of dose escalation, and Part B will consist of dose confirmation.
Advanced Cancer
DRUG: LY2228820|DRUG: Midazolam|DRUG: Tamoxifen
Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Effects (Physical Assessments and Safety Lab Tests), Data presented are the number of participants who experienced at least one treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE). A TEAE is defined as an event that first occurred or worsened after the administration of at least 1 dose of study drug, regardless of causality. A summary of serious AEs (SAEs) and other non-serious AEs, regardless of causality, is located in the Reported Adverse Events module., Baseline to study completion (Up to 41 months)
Recommended Dose for Phase 2 Studies, Recommended Phase 2 dose was determined by maximum tolerated dose (MTD), which was determined by Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). For the purpose of this study, the MTD was defined as the highest dose level at which no more than 33% of participants experience a DLT during Cycle 1., Baseline to study completion (Up to 41 months)|Percentage of Participants With Best Overall Response [Complete Response (CR)+Partial Response (PR)+Stable Disease (SD)], Response was defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST, version 1.1) criteria. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level in non-target lesions. PR was defined as having at least a 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions. PD was defined as having at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesion and appearance of â‰¥1 new lesion and/or unequivocal progression of existing nontarget lesions. SD was defined as small changes that did not meet the above criteria taking as reference the smallest sum LD since treatment started., Baseline to study completion (Up to 41 months)|PK: Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve From Time Zero to 8 Hours (AUC0-8) of LY2228820, Cycle 1, Days 1 and 14: predose, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 h postdose|PK: Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of LY2228820, Cycle 1, Days 1 and 14: predose, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 h postdose|Pharmacodynamics (PD): Number of Participants With Greater Than 50% Inhibition of p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) Activity on Day 1, The effect of LY2228820 on PD biomarker was measured as MAPK-activated protein kinase -2 (MAPKAP-K2) level which is regulated by p38 MAPK activity. Inhibition of p38 MAPK activity will result in lower levels of MAPKAPK-2., Cycle 1 Day 1: predose, 1, 2, 4, and 6 h postdose
