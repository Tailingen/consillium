EGF816 and Trametinib in Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Harboring Activating EGFR Mutations
The aim of this trial is to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended phase II dose (RP2D), to define pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters and the preliminary efficacy of a continuous treatment with EGF816 and trametinib in locally advanced or metastatic (stage IIIB or IV) lung cancer patients with activating mutations in the epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR).

The population of interest for this trial is defined by patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harbouring the sensitizing EGFR mutations del19 or p.L858R. Patients may be enrolled in first- or later lines of therapy and independently of the prior (approved) EGFR inhibitor administered and independently of the EGFR p.T790M-status. Those individuals whose tumors harbour high-level amplifications of MET or other EGFR mutations except for del19, p.L858R or p.T790M will be excluded from the trial. The molecular status must have been determined in a biopsy collected at progression to the last systemic and prior to the initiation of the trial treatment

The aim of the trial is to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for a continuous treatment with the 3rd generation EGFR inhibitor EGF816 and the MEK inhibitor trametinib.

The recommendations for dose level escalations will be based on an "up-and-down" design proposed by Storer, 1989. The dose limiting toxicity (DLT) period comprises the first 28 days of treatment with EGF816 and trametinib at the designated dose level (Cycle 1).

PK parameters of the combination treatment will be assessed for every dose level in every patient during the dose-escalation part.

Preliminary efficacy of EGF816 and trametinib in the trial population will be assessed by RECIST (v1.1) analysis of scheduled CT scans (every 8 weeks or as clinically indicated.

Throughout the study blood samples will be collected to monitor cell free plasma DNA (cfDNA).

Patients who develop resistance upon treatment with the study drugs will undergo a rebiopsy to identify potential mechanisms of resistance.
