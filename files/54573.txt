Application of High-dose Insulin Therapy to Improve Liver Function and Regeneration
The primary objective of this interventional study is determine if the future liver remnant can be optimized by improving liver function pre-operatively in patients who are scheduled for major hepatectomy. The main questions it aims to answer are:

1. Does high-dose insulin therapy improve liver function in the pre-operative setting?
2. What is the effect of high-dose insulin therapy on liver function and liver regeneration after a liver venous deprivation (LVD) procedure?
3. What is the relationship between volume hypertrophy and function in the regenerating liver? Participants will receive a 6-hour infusion of insulin and dextrose to maintain a hyperinsulinemic-normoglycemic state in the weeks prior to planned liver surgery to assess its effect on liver function measured by 99m-Tc-Mebrofenin hepatobiliary scintigraphy.

DRUG: High-Dose Insulin Therapy
Liver function improvement after high-dose insulin therapy measured with 99mTc-Mebrofenin Hepatobiliary Scintigraphy (HBS)., 99mTc-Mebrofenin HBS is a diagnostic nuclear medicine imaging procedure used to evaluate liver function by measuring radiotracer uptake and excretion. The outcome will be evaluating a measurable increase in 99mTc-Mebrofenin (measured %/min/meter\^2) from baseline scan to post-treatment scan., Baseline to 24-hours post treatment|Liver function improvement after high-dose insulin therapy after LVD measured with 99mTc-Mebrofenin Hepatobiliary Scintigraphy (HBS)., 99mTc-Mebrofenin HBS is a diagnostic nuclear medicine imaging procedure used to evaluate liver function by measuring radiotracer uptake and excretion.
