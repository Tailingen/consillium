Relapsed Refractory B Precursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
DRUG: Blinatumomab

All hematological assessments of bone marrow were reviewed in a central reference laboratory.

Hematological remissions were defined by the following criteria:

* Complete Remission (CR) is defined as ≤ 5% blasts in the bone marrow, no evidence of disease, and full recovery of peripheral blood counts: platelets \> 100,000/µl and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \> 1,000/µl.

The severity of adverse events was assessed by the investigator according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 as follows: Grade 1 - Mild AE; Grade 2 - Moderate AE; Grade 3 - Severe AE; Grade 4 - Life-threatening or disabling AE; Grade 5 - Death.

The investigator used medical judgment to determine if there was a causal relationship (ie, related, unrelated) between an adverse event and blinatumomab., From the start of the first infusion to 30 days after the end of the last infusion; median (min, max) treatment duration was 55.6 (25, 140) and 28.0 (8, 56) days in the adult and pediatric expansion cohorts, respectively.
Phase 1b Adults: Percentage of Participants With a Best Response of Complete Remission or Complete Remission With Only Partial Hematological Recovery Within 2 Cycles of Treatment, Hematological assessments were performed from bone marrow biopsy samples.

* the date of bone marrow aspiration at which hematological relapse or progressive disease (PD) was first detected,
* the date of diagnosis on which the hematological or extra medullary relapse was documented,
* the date of death if patient died due to PD
* the date of end of induction phase if primary reason for treatment termination was hematological or extramedullary relapse.

For a responder who did not report an event and was alive during the study, the end date of duration (censoring) was based on the date of the last available bone marrow aspiration prior to the data cutoff date for the analysis. Participants with response who did not report an event and who died due to reasons other than PD, were censored on the date of death, with death treated as a competing risk., Median (minimum [min], maximum [max]) follow-up time was 6.3 (2.4, 13.6) months for Phase 1b and 26.7 (3.0, 28.5) months for Phase 2.|Phase 1b and Phase 2: Relapse-free Survival, Relapse-free survival (RFS) was defined for participants who achieved a response (CR/CRh\*) during the first 2 cycles of treatment. RFS was calculated from the date of bone marrow aspiration when response was detected for the first time to the date of bone marrow aspiration at which hematological relapse was first detected or the date of diagnosis on which the hematological or extra medullary relapse was documented or the date of death due to any cause, whichever was earlier. Participants who did not experience hematological relapse and did not die were censored on the date of the last available bone marrow aspiration prior to the data cutoff date for the analysis., Median (min, max) follow-up time was 6.3 (2.4, 13.6) months for Phase 1b and 26.7 (3.0, 28.5) months for Phase 2.|Phase 1b and Phase 2: Overall Survival, Overall survival (OS) was calculated from the start date of blinatumomab infusion in the first treatment cycle.

The Phase 1b part will investigate the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of blinatumomab to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in both adult and pediatric Japanese patients with relapsed/refractory B-precursor ALL. The Phase 2 part will assess the safety and efficacy of the recommended dose level of blinatumomab identified in the Phase 1b portion of the study in the adult study population.

In June 2017 protocol amendment 4 extended the study to include an expansion cohort of approximately 65 participants to investigate the safety of blinatumomab in participants who did not participate in Phase 1b or Phase 2 of the study. Adult and pediatric patients in the expansion cohort may receive up to 5 cycles of investigational blinatomumab and may receive commercial blinatomumab after a minimum of 2 cycles of the investigational drug.
