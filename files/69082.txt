Use of Indocyanine Green in Pancreas Surgery
This study evaluates the use of indocyanine green to predict postoperative pancreatic leaks in patients undergoing transection of the pancreas.
Pancreatic Carcinoma
OTHER: Non-Interventional Study
Incidence of biochemical leak or fistula after pancreatectomy., Measurement of drain fluid amylase in post operative period. Defined by definitions of the International Study Group on Pancreatic Surgery (ISGPS) criteria, Up to 30 days after surgery|Perfusion status, Measured by Indocyanine green (ICG) metrics., During surgical intervention (hours)
Leak grade via ISGPS classification, Can be either bile leak, Grade B postoperative pancreatic fistula or grade C postoperative pancreatic fistula, Up to 30 days after surgery|Leak grade by ICG metrics, ISGPS classification of leak or fistula and the perfusion metrics measures by ICG., Up to 30 days after surgery|Best practice usage of ICG for pancreatic surgery, Measures through verbal survey to surgeons or OR members, Assessed at surgery number 15, approximate 6 months
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To determine if altered measurement results of ICG after pancreatectomy is associated with leak rates.

OUTLINE: This is an observational study.

Patients receive indocyanine green intravenously (IV) during surgery, undergo imaging and have their medical records reviewed on study.
