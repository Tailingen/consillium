A Phase 1/2 Study of CT120 in Patient With Relapsed/Refractory B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
This study is a single-armed, open-label,multicenter Phase 1/2 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CT120 in subjects with relapsed/refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
DRUG: Fully Human Anti-CD19/CD22 Dual Target Chimeric Antigen Receptor Autologous T Cell Injection
Phase 1: Types and incidence of Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) will be collected and graded according to American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) consensus (for CRS/ICANS) and CTCAE v5.0(for AE except CRS/ICANS), up to 28 days after CT120 infusion|Phase 1:Types and incidence of adverse events (AEs) ，serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse events of special interest (AESI), AE will be collected and graded according to American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) consensus (for CRS/ICANS) and CTCAE v5.0(for AE except CRS/ICANS), Up to 2 years after CT120 CAR T-cells infusion|Phase 2:Overall response rate (ORR) at Day 90, ORR will be calculated as the percentage of patients who achieved partial response (PR) or better at Day 90, Up to 90 Days after CT120 infusion
Overall response rate (ORR), ORR will be calculated as the percentage of patients who achieved partial response (PR) or better., Up to Day 28、Day 90、Day180 after CT120 infusion|Time to Response (TTR), Time from CT120 infusion to first documentation of response., Up to 2 years after CT120 infusion|Time to complete Response (TTCR), Time from CT120 infusion to first documentation of complete response., Up to 2 years after CT120 infusion|Duration of Response (DOR), Time from first response to disease progression or death from any cause, Up to 2 years after CT120 infusion|Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS will be calculated as the time from CT120 infusion to disease progression or death from any cause (whichever occurs first)., Up to 2 years after CT120 infusion|Overall Survival (OS), Time from CT120 infusion to time of death due to any cause, Up to 2 years after CT120 infusion|Quantity of CAR copies in peripheral blood, CAR copies in peripheral blood will be measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in 2 years., Up to 2 years after CT120 infusion|Quantity of CAR T-cells level in peripheral blood, CAR T-cells in peripheral blood will be measured by flow cytometry (FCM) in 2 years, Up to 2 years after CT120 infusion|Laboratory tests, Abnormal results of laboratory tests, Up to 2 years after CT120 infusion|Vital signs, Abnormal results of vital signs, Up to 2 years after CT120 infusion|Physical examination, Abnormal results of physical examination, Up to 2 years after CT120 infusion
Immunogenicity, Development of an anti-CAR antibody response, Up to 2 years after CT120 infusion|Replication competent lentivirus (RCL), The incidence of replication competent lentivirus (RCL), Up to 15 years after CT120 infusion|Changes in the proportion of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets, Changes in the proportion of lymphocyte subsets in the peripheral blood will be analyzed by immune cell phenotyping using flow cytometry., Up to 2 years after CT120 infusion|Correlation between cytokines/inflammation-related proteins and Incidence of Adverse Event, Up to 2 years after CT120 infusion|Correlation between cytokines/inflammation-related proteins and efficacy, Up to 2 years after CT120 infusion|Correlation between efficacy and CD19/CD22 antigen expression in tumor tissues, Up to 2 years after CT120 infusion|Correlation between efficacy and gene mutations including MYC, BCL2 and BCL6 rearrangements, Up to 2 years after CT120 infusion|Correlation between efficacy and and the expression of oncogenes including C-myc and BCL, Up to 2 years after CT120 infusion
Leukapheresis procedure will be performed to manufacture CT120. Bridging therapy is allowed between PBMC collection and lymphodepletion. Lymphodepletion with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide was performed for three consecutive days. After 1-day rest, subjects will receive a single dose infusion of CT120. Subjects will be followed in the study for a minimum of 2 years after CT120 infusion. Long-term follow-up for lentiviral vector safety will be followed for up to 15 years after CT120 infusion.
