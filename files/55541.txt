A Phase I/II Study to Investigate the Use of VORAXAZE™ As Intended Intervention in Patients with CNSL
This phase I-II trial is intented to demonstrate tolerability (i.e. absence of severe non-hematological toxicity) and efficacy of intended intervention with repeated doses of Voraxaze, in addition to leucovorin (LV), in patients with renal impairment or renal failure during previous HD-MTX therapy.

Patients will receive up to 6 cycles of HD-MTX treatment with 14 days between cycles (a maximum delay of 28 days is permitted in order to allow time for a patient to recover from the previous cycle).
CNS Lymphoma
DRUG: Voraxaze Injectable Product
Tolerability of Voraxaze, absence of severe non-hematological toxicity, 1 year|Efficacy of Voraxaze, immediate and sustained reduction in plasma MTX concentration, 1 year
Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), appearance of DLTs for each dose level of MTX, 1 year|Anti-glucarpidase antibodies, presence of antibodies to glucarpidase, at screening, prior to the MTX infusion at each treatment cycle and on day 28 of the last cycle|MTX toxicities, incidence and severity of hematological toxicities and stomatitis after each cycle of HD-MTX treatment and renal function before each cycle of HD-MTX treatment, 1 year
MTX is used either alone or as part of a combined chemotherapy protocol either in standard or high doses in the treatment of a range of cancers and other diseases.

Dose escalation will be performed using three dose levels of MTX:

Level 1: 3.0 g/m2 Level 2: 3.5 g/m2 Level 3: 4.0 g/m2 Up to 6 patients will be treated at each dose level; each will receive a maximum of 6 cycles of treatment. The dose may be increased in Cycle 3 in individual patients to the next level, if renal function is adequate (GFR ≥ 40 mL/min, or in the case of decreased GFR, the decrease is \<10% compared with the pre-treatment value), and absence of grade 3 or 4 non-hematological toxicities.
