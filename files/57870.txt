Biomarkers in Samples From Young Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia
RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about biomarkers related to cancer.

PURPOSE: This research study is studying biomarkers in samples from young patients with acute myeloid leukemia.

OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the extent and prognostic implications of variable s-SHIP expression and SHIP gene mutations in pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia.
* Determine the effects of aberrant s-SHIP expression on the PI3K/Akt pathway in these patients via electrochemiluminescence and phosphospecific flow cytometry assays.

OUTLINE: RNA samples are analyzed for variable s-SHIP expression and are screened for SHIP mutations. Cryopreserved cells (with known high- or low-s-SHIP expression) are analyzed for the levels of various components of the PI3K/Akt pathway via electrochemiluminescence and phosphospecific flow cytometry.
