A Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of MEGF0444A Dosed to Progression in Combination With Bevacizumab and mFOLFOX-6 in Participants With Previously Untreated Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
This is a Phase II, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to estimate the efficacy of MEGF0444A treatment to disease progression, combined with oxaliplatin + folinic acid + 5-Fluorouracil (mFOLFOX-6) + bevacizumab therapy in participants with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC).
