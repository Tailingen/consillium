Gemcitabine and Epirubicin in Treating Patients With Malignant Mesothelioma
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining gemcitabine and epirubicin in treating patients who have malignant mesothelioma.
Malignant Mesothelioma
DRUG: epirubicin hydrochloride|DRUG: gemcitabine hydrochloride
time to progression, Up to 5 years
survival, Up to 5 years|quality of life, Up to 5 years
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the antitumor activity of gemcitabine and epirubicin in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma.
* Determine the toxicity of this regimen in this patient population.
* Determine the time to progression and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.
* Assess quality of life in patients treated with this regimen.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 and epirubicin IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses beyond CR.

Quality of life is assessed at baseline, prior to course 3, at 3 months, and then at 1 year.

Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 3 years.
