Patient-centered Development of the Cancer Support Community's Open to Options Â®Chatbot Program
This study is designed to study the feasibility and acceptability of the Open to Options (O2O) Chatbot prototype. The O2O program is an existing patient support program with content currently delivered via in-person counseling with a trained mental health professional or via an existing web-based program (Let's Talk Treatment Options).The Chatbot is an automated, menu-based agent being developed in this study to extend the reach and accessibility of the O2O program via the Chatbot's "virtual coaching".

Feasibility of Integrating Chatbot in Clinic, The feasibility of integrating an Open to Options (O2O) Chatbot into the clinical workflow, assessed by the number of patients who accept the invitation to receive more information about the study, among all those invited., At the time of scheduling an appointment with cancer physician; one day|Acceptability - Reach, Assessed by the number of patients who log-in to the O2O Chatbot program and create an account, among all those who accepted the invitation to receive information., Baseline (Before appointment with cancer physician); up to approximately 3 weeks after scheduling appointment|Acceptability - Uptake, Assessed by the number of patients who proceed to view the full Chatbot prototype and generate a summary, among all those who created an account., Baseline (Before appointment with cancer physician); up to approximately 3 weeks after scheduling appointment|Acceptability - Mean Satisfaction Scores, Post-Intervention Survey Group only: In addition to the survey given to all participants, the post-intervention survey group will answer 6 questions about their perception of the Chatbot prototype. Each of the 6 questions will be scored on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Investigators will calculate the mean value (and Standard Deviation) on a 1-5 scale for each question., Baseline (Before appointment with cancer physician); up to approximately 3 weeks after scheduling appointment|Acceptability - Percent of Participants with High Satisfaction Scores, Post-Intervention Survey Group only: In addition to the survey given to all participants, the post-intervention survey group will answer 6 questions about their perception of the Chatbot prototype. Each of the 6 questions will be scored on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). For each of the six questions, investigators will calculate the percentage of participants who strongly agree., Baseline (Before appointment with cancer physician); up to approximately 3 weeks after scheduling appointment
Mean Patient-reported Appraisal Outcomes, Mean values of the following 5 self-appraisals:

* Cancer related distress \[scale from 0 (none) to 10 (extreme)\]
* Cancer diagnosis anxiety \[scale from 0 (none) to 10 (extreme)\]
* Self-efficacy for question asking \[scale from 0 (not at all confident) to 10 (extremely confident)\]
* Decision preparedness \[scale from 1 (not at all) to 5 (a great deal)\]
* Decision self-efficacy \[scale from 0 (not at all confident) to 4 (very confident)\]

The mean values will be compared by group (pre- vs. post-intervention survey group) using t-tests., Baseline (Before appointment with cancer physician); up to approximately 3 weeks after scheduling appointment
This is a pilot study to assess feasibility and acceptability, and to gather preliminary data on how patients with a diagnosis of cancer appraise being prepared for their upcoming visit with a cancer specialist. Participants will be randomized to take a survey either before or after their Chatbot interaction. The surveys collect participants' self-appraisal regarding preparedness for their upcoming appointment with a cancer physician, cancer distress and cancer anxiety. The study will examine whether patients who take the survey after viewing the Chatbot feel more prepared for their upcoming appointment than those who take the survey before the Chatbot interaction.
