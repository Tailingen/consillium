Allogeneic Tumor Cell Vaccination in Patients With Solid Tumors
The goal of this study is to apply allogeneic tumor cell vaccination for immunotherapy in patients with micro-metastatic disease and/or in patients at high risk disease progression. The present study will use allogeneic tumor cell lines for tumor cell vaccines that share MHC determinants with the patient aiming to overcome possible restriction of antigen presentation.
Metastatic Solid Tumors
BIOLOGICAL: Tumor Cell Vaccine
Investigate the feasibility of anti-tumor immune response by allogeneic tumor cell vaccine using tumor cells that share MHC determinants with the patient.
Investigate the feasibility of immune responses against cancer cells by combining allogeneic TCV with indomethacin, cimetidine, tetanus and rIL-2.
