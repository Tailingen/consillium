Safety and Clinical Activity of ThisCART19 in Patients With r/r Non-Hodgkin's B Cell Lymphoma
A single arm, open-label, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of ThisCART19 (Allogeneic CAR-T targeting CD19) in patients with relapsed and/or refractory non-Hodgkin's B cell lymphoma (r/r B-NHL).
