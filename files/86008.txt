Assess the Efficacy of AZD8931 in Combination With Paclitaxel Versus Paclitaxel Alone in Patients With Gastric Cancer
The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety and PK of AZD8931 plus paclitaxel versus paclitaxel alone in patients with metastatic, gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction, cancer.
Metastatic, Gastric or Gastro-oesophageal Junction, Cancer
DRUG: AZD8931|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Paclitaxel
Change in Tumour Size at 8 Weeks Were Analyzed for Comparing Relative Efficacy of AZD8931 Plus Paclitaxel With Paclitaxel Alone, Baseline and 8 weeks, accessed up to data cut off on 4 December 2012
Progression-free Survival (PFS) Were Analysed for Comparing Relative Efficacy of AZD8931 Plus Paclitaxel With Paclitaxel Alone, Time from the date of randomization until the date of objective disease progression (as per RECIST1.1) or the date of death (by any cause in absence of progression)., Baseline and every 8 weeks, accessed up to data cut off on 4 December 2012|The Objective Response Rate (ORR) Was Analysed for Investigating the Efficacy of AZD8931 Plus Paclitaxel With Paclitaxel Alone, The number of subjects with at least one visit response of CR or PR. (Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive disease (PD), A ≥ 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions and an absolute increase of ≥ 5mm; Stable disease (SD), Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD; Not Evaluable (NE), All target lesion measurements are missing or \>1/3 target lesion measurements are missing and sum of diameters of non-missing target lesions does not qualify for PD; Not applicable (NA), No target lesions are recorded at baseline), Baseline and 8 weeks, accessed up to data cut off on 4 December 2012
A Phase IIa Multi-centre Randomised Double-Blind Placebo-controlled Study to Assess the Efficacy, Safety and Pharmacokinetics of AZD8931 in Combination with Paclitaxel versus Paclitaxel alone in Patients with Metastatic, Gastric or Gastro-oesophageal Junction, Cancer who progress following First Line Therapy and are Ineligible for Treatment with trastuzumab by HER2 Status (SAGE)
