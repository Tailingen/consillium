A Study of Trastuzumab Deruxtecan (T-DXd) Versus Trastuzumab Emtansine (T-DM1) in High-risk HER2-positive Participants With Residual Invasive Breast Cancer Following Neoadjuvant Therapy (DESTINY-Breast05)
Patients with HER2-positive primary breast cancer (BC) who do not achieve complete response after appropriate neoadjuvant therapy are at higher risk of disease recurrence. More effective treatment options are needed for this patient population. This study will examine the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) compared with trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) in high-risk patients with residual invasive breast cancer following neoadjuvant therapy.
HER2-Positive Primary Breast Cancer|Residual Invasive Breast Cancer
DRUG: DS-8201a|DRUG: T-DM1
Invasive Disease-free Survival (IDFS) in Participants Who Were Administered Trastuzumab Deruxtecan (T-DXd) Compared With Trastuzumab Emtansine (T-DM1) Treatment, Randomization to date of invasive local, axillary or distant recurrence, invasive contralateral breast cancer or death from any cause (whichever occurs first), up to approximately 57 months postdose
Disease-free Survival (DFS) in Participants Who Were Administered Trastuzumab Deruxtecan (T-DXd) Compared With Trastuzumab Emtansine (T-DM1) Treatment, Randomization to date of the first occurrence of an IDFS event including second primary non-breast cancer event or contralateral or ipsilateral ductal carcinoma in situ (whichever occurs first), up to approximately 81 months postdose|Overall Survival (OS) in Participants Who Were Administered Trastuzumab Deruxtecan (T-DXd) Compared With Trastuzumab Emtansine (T-DM1) Treatment, Randomization to date of death from any cause, up to approximately 81 months postdose|Distant Recurrence-free Interval (DRFI) in Participants Who Were Administered Trastuzumab Deruxtecan (T-DXd) Compared With Trastuzumab Emtansine (T-DM1) Treatment, Randomization to date of distant recurrence, up to approximately 81 months postdose|Brain Metastases-free Interval (BMFI) in Participants Who Were Administered Trastuzumab Deruxtecan (T-DXd) Compared With Trastuzumab Emtansine (T-DM1) Treatment, Randomization to date of brain metastasis, up to approximately 81 months postdose|Percentage of Treatment-emergent Adverse Events in Participants Who Were Administered Trastuzumab Deruxtecan (T-DXd) Compared With Trastuzumab Emtansine (T-DM1) Treatment, Baseline up to approximately 81 months postdose|Serum Concentrations of Trastuzumab Deruxtecan (T-DXd), total anti-HER2 antibody, and Active Metabolite MAAA-1181a, Pre-dose on Day 1 of Cycles 1, 4 and 10 and within 15 minutes post-dose on Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 4 (each cycle is 21 days)|Percentage of Participants Positive for Treatment-emergent Anti-drug Antibodies (ADAs) in Participants Who Were Administered Trastuzumab Deruxtecan (T-DXd), Baseline up to approximately 81 months postdose
This study will examine trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) versus trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) in patients with HER2-positive primary BC who have residual invasive disease in breast or axillary lymph nodes with higher risk of recurrence, which includes patients who were inoperable at disease presentation or had pathological node-positive status after neoadjuvant therapy.

The primary objective is to compare invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) between T-DXd and T-DM1 treatment arms in this population. The key secondary objective of the study is to evaluate disease-free survival (DFS).
