Detection of Resistance Mechanisms in Cerebrospinal Fluid for EGFR-mutant, ALK- and ROS1-rearranged
To determine the detection rate of driver oncogenes and resistance mechanisms in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for patients with CNS progression (with or without extra-CNS (eCNS) progression) and concordance with plasma/tissue
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: InVisionFirst-Lung ctDNA assay
Determine the detection rate of driver oncogenes and resistance mechanisms in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for patients with CNS progression (with or without extra-CNS (eCNS) progression) and concordance with plasma/tissue, * For each individual patient with CNS progression (with or without eCNS progression), compare the molecular status (primary oncogene detection and any mechanisms of identifiable resistance including EGFR-, ALK- and ROS1-mutations, ALK-amplification and bypass-tracks activating mutations) of CSF, plasma and CNS tissue (if data from pathology report is available)
* Molecular status will also be compared with previously obtained and stored plasma/tissue prior to the initiation of current next-generation tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI), 3 years
Compare and contrast mechanisms of resistance in CNS progression versus eCNS progression, * For patients with both CNS and eCNS progression, compare distribution of resistance mechanisms between CSF, plasma, CNS tissue (if data from pathology report is available) and tissue from site of eCNS progression (if data from pathology report is available)
* Compare distribution of resistance mechanisms in CSF for all patients with CNS progression (with or without eCNS progression) to historical data of distribution of resistance mechanisms to next-generation TKI from ctDNA/tumor tissue samples, 3 years
