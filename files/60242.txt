Imatinib Mesylate and Zoledronic Acid in Patients With Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia in Cytogenetic Response Without Molecular Response
Imatinib mesylate is standard treatment of Chronic myeloid leukaemia, complete cytogenetic response is obtained in most of cases but molecular response concerned only a small part of the patients. To increase molecular response ratio we decided to increase imatinib dose to limited resistance to this drug and to add zoledronate for it anti tumoral activity to increase anti leukemic effect. We plan to accrue 37 patients in 5 centers. We will analyse molecular expression of BCR-ABL transcript after 6 months of treatment, safety, duration of response, VEGF expression and LTgd production.
Myeloid Leukemia, Chronic
DRUG: Glivec
Percentage of Participants With Molecular Response, A patient is considered to be in molecular response if at least one of the following conditions is observed :

- a complete molecular response at 6 months defined by PCR negativation tested on twice

OR

- reduction of BCR-ABL transcript level \> 2 Log from the start of from initiation of treatment, 6 months
Percentage of Participants With a Reduction of BCR-ABL Transcript Level > 4.5 Log From the Start of From Initiation of Treatment, reduction of BCR-ABL transcript level \> 4.5 Log from the start of from initiation of treatment, 6 months
