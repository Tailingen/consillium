Study of Predictors of Clinical Outcomes in Patients With HR+ and HER2-low/Negative Breast Cancer
There is a lack of data on clinical and patient factors that are associated with poor survival in patients with HR+ and HER2-low/negative breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy or endocrine therapy. This retrospective, non-interventional study is designed to assess the predictors of clinical outcomes in this patient population. No study drug will be provided as part of this study protocol.

Event-free survival (EFS) in Participants With HR+ and HER2-Low/Negative Breast Cancer, Events of interest include any other primary cancer, metastases, higher stage, tumor progression, and death due to any cause., Index date to the end of the study period (approximately December 31, 2022)|Overall Survival of Participants With HR+ and HER2-Low/Negative Breast Cancer, Index date to the end of the study period (approximately December 31, 2022)|Pathological Complete Response (pCR) in Participants With HR+ and HER2-Low/Negative Breast Cancer, Pathological complete response (pCR) was defined as ypT0/Tis ypN0 and is the absence of any invasive component in the resected breast specimen and all resected lymph nodes following completion of neoadjuvant therapy., Index date to the end of the study period (approximately December 31, 2022)
This retrospective, non-interventional study is designed to assess the following primary objectives:

1. To identify predictors of event-free survival (EFS) in patients with HR+ and HER2-low/negative breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy or endocrine therapy, and
2. To stratify patients according to event-free survival using different combinations of significant predictors and evaluate the patient characteristics and clinical outcomes such as EFS, overall survival and pathological complete response across patient groups of different risk level.
