ARX788 in HER2-positive Breast Cancer Patients With Brain Metastases
A Phase 2 Study of ARX788 in HER2-positive, Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients whose Disease is resistant or refractory to Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI).
HER2-positive, Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: ARX788
Central nervous system (CNS) clinical benefit rate (CBR), CNS CBR is defined as the percentage of subjects who have achieved complete response, partial response, and stable disease according to the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Brain Metastases (RANO-BM) criteria, 2 years
Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time between date of first dose of study therapy and date of progression or death, whichever occurs first, will be computed for response evaluable subjects. Subjects will be censored at time of subsequent therapy, 2 years|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from first dose of study therapy to the date of death (any cause). Subjects who are alive will be censored at the last known time that the subject was alive, 2 years|Site of first progression, Record the organs where the disease first progressed during the study, 2 years|The number of subjects experiencing adverse events, Patient safety and adverse events (AEs) will be evaluated using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v.5.0. All AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be assessed to determine the safety and tolerability of the treatment., 2 years
This is an open-label, single arm, phase 2 study of ARX788 in HER2-positive, metastatic breast cancer patients whose disease is resistant or refractory to TKI. The ARX788 will be administered every 3 weeks (Q3W) intravenous (IV) infusion. In this study, Simon's two-stage design is used. Subjects received treatment until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal from the study, or discontinuation judged by the investigator. Drug efficacy and safety data will be collected.
