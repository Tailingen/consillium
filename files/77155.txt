Study of Perioperative Dostarlimab in Participants With Untreated T4N0 or Stage III dMMR/MSI-H Resectable Colon Cancer
The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of perioperative dostarlimab compared with standard of care (SOC) in participants with untreated T4N0 or Stage III (resectable), defective mismatch repair/ microsatellite instability high (dMMR/MSI-H) colon cancer.

Event-free Survival (EFS) Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), EFS is defined as the time from randomization to either disease recurrence or death due to any cause or treatment related toxicity that results in the participant not being suitable for surgery, Up to approximately 5 years
Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as time from randomization to death from any cause, Up to approximately 5 years|Number of Participants with Pathological Response, Pathological response will be categorized as a complete pathologic response, major pathologic response, partial pathologic response, or negligible pathologic response., Up to approximately 5 years|Event-free Survival (EFS) assessed by local assessment, EFS is defined as the time from randomization to either disease recurrence or death due to any cause or treatment related toxicity that results in the participant not being suitable for surgery, Up to approximately 5 years|Number of Participants with treatment emergent adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), Immune-mediated Adverse Event (imAEs), AEs leading to death and AEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment, Up to approximately 5 years|Number of Participants with AEs and SAEs by Severity, Up to approximately 5 years|Serum Concentration of Dostarlimab, Predose and End of Infusion (EoI) of Cycle 1 and EoI of Cycle 2 to Cycle 10 (each cycle is of 21 days)|Serum Concentration of Dostarlimab at End of Infusion (C-EoI), End of Infusion (EoI) of Cycle 1 to Cycle 10 (each cycle is of 21 days)|Serum Predose trough concentration (Ctrough) of Dostarlimab, Predose of Cycle 1 to Cycle 10 (each cycle is of 21 days)|Number of Participants with Anti-Drug Antibodies against Dostarlimab, Up to approximately 5 years
