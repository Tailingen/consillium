Evaluation of Efficacy, Safety of Vandetanib in Patients With Differentiated Thyroid Cancer
Primary Objective:

To determine the efficacy (as assessed by progression-free survival \[PFS\]) of vandetanib when compared to placebo in participants with differentiated thyroid cancer that is either locally advanced or metastatic who are refractory or unsuitable for radioiodine therapy.

Secondary Objectives:

* To determine the efficacy of vandetanib when compared to placebo in this participant population as assessed by efficacy variables including duration of response (DOR), objective response rate (ORR), change in tumour size (TS) and overall survival (OS).
* To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of vandetanib in this participant population and potentially investigate any influence of participant demography and pathophysiology on vandetanib PK.
* To demonstrate an improvement in time to worsening of pain (TWP) in participants treated with vandetanib when compared to placebo in this participant population.
* To evaluate the safety and tolerability of vandetanib treatment in this participant population.
Differentiated Thyroid Cancer
DRUG: Vandetanib (SAR390530)|DRUG: Placebo
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), The PFS was defined as the time (in months) from randomization until the date of first documented disease progression or death (from any cause), whichever came first. Disease progression as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) was defined as: at least a 20% increase and absolute increase of 5 mm in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. Analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier method., Randomization until disease progression or death, assessed every 12 weeks (up to 22 months)
Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from the date of randomization until death due to any cause. In the absence of observation of death, survival time was censored to last date the participant is known to be alive or at the cut-off date, whichever comes first. Analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier method., From randomization to the date of death due to any cause (maximum duration: up to 42 months)|Randomized Treatment Period: Percent Change From Baseline in Tumor Size (TS) at Week 36, Tumor size was the sum of the longest diameters of the target lesions. Target lesions were measurable tumor lesions. Baseline was defined as the last evaluable assessment prior to starting treatment., Baseline, Week 36|Percentage of Participants With Objective Response, Objective Response was defined as the percentage (%) of participants with complete response or partial response. Per RECIST 1.1 criteria, complete response was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions since Baseline. Any pathological lymph nodes selected as target lesions must have a reduction in short axis to less than (\<)10 millimeters (mm). Partial response was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the Baseline sum of diameters. Progressive Disease was defined as at least at least a 20% increase and absolute increase of 5 mm in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions., From randomization to the date of first documented tumor progression, or death due to any cause, whichever comes first (maximum duration: up to 42 months)|Time to Worsening of Pain (TWP) Using Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) of Worst Pain, Time to worsening of pain was defined as the time interval from the date of randomization to the date of first assessment of worsening of pain with no evidence of improvement within the next 14 days. Participants rate their worst pain intensity during the past seven days using an 11-point NRS scale, where 0 represents "no pain" and 10 represents "pain as bad as you can imagine." Higher scores indicated greater pain severity. TWP analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier method., From randomization to the date of first assessment of worsening of pain (maximum duration: up to 42 months)|Duration of Response (DOR), Duration of response was defined as the time from the date of first documented response until the date of documented progression or death. If participants did not progress following a response, then their DOR used the PFS censoring time. Per RECIST 1.1, progressive disease was defined as at least a 20% increase and absolute increase of 5 mm in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. DOR analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier method., From the date of first response to the date of first documented tumor progression or death due to any cause whichever comes first (maximum duration: up to 42 months)|Randomized Treatment Period: PK Parameters: Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Post-dose on Week 1 to Week 48
Participants who received vandetanib as randomized treatment were allowed, upon re-consent, to continue on open-label vandetanib if in the opinion of the Investigator the participant received benefit. Placebo participants who experienced disease progression within 60 days of unblinding were offered the option of treatment with open-label vandetanib if, in the Investigator's opinion, such treatment was of clinical benefit to the participant. Approximately 2 years; duration depends on individual participant response.
