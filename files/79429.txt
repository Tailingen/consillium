Study of WST11 in Patients With Localized Prostate Cancer
The aim of this clinical study is to determine the optimal treatment conditions to achieve prostate cancer tumor ablation and to assess the effects of WST11 mediated VTP treatment in patients with localized prostate cancer.

The secondary objectives is to evaluate safety and quality of life ; to assess the pharmacokinetic parameters and to model the relationship between concentration and effects; and to assess the effects, the safety and quality of life of a second WST11 VTP treatment in patients with persistent or recurrent localized prostate cancer after a first VTP;
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: WST11
Negative biopsy in the treated lobe, Month 6
Volume of the hypoperfusion area shown by dynamic gadolinium MRI . Serum PSA levels and PSA changes . Adverse Events, ECG (12-lead), vital signs, clinical laboratory evaluations, physical examination Quality of Life:•IPSS •IIEF, Day 7; Month 1 ;3 and 6
This trial is designed as a multicentre, phase II, open-labeled, single intra-venous (IV) dose study. The patient is to receive general anesthesia. WST11-mediated VTP will consist of the combination of a single IV administration of WST11 at doses of 2 mg/Kg,4mg/Kg or 6 mg/kg, using 753 nm laser light at a fixed power (150mW/cm) and energy (200 J/cm) delivered through transperineal interstitial optical fibers. If deemed necessary and in consideration of the results of the patients treated with 200 J/cm, alternate power (200mW/cm) and alternate energy (300 J/cm) might be applied after Sponsor, Steering Committee and DSMB approval.The fibers are introduced into transparent needles that are positioned in the prostate under ultra sound image guidance (using a brachytherapy like template). The tumor location is established using transrectal biopsy and MR imaging. The number of fibers and the total light energy will be adapted to each patient, taking into account the tumor localization and the volume of the prostate.
