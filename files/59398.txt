De-escalated Radiation for Human Papillomavirus-Positive Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Oropharynx
This is a single-arm, observational registry study determining the effects of reduced radiation dose in select patients with human papillomavirus (HPV) positive oropharyngeal cancer.
HPV Positive Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
RADIATION: Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT)
2-Year Progression-Free Survival, Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from registration to disease progression or death from any cause., Given the natural history of this disease, PFS will be monitored up to 2 years from registration
Overall survival, Survival time will be measured from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause or last follow-up., Given the natural history of this disease, overall survival will be monitored for up to 2 years from registration|Local-regional control, Local-regional control is defined as the absence of local and/or regional progression., Given the natural history of this disease, local-regional control will be monitored up to 2 years from registration
