RO4929097 and Capecitabine in Treating Patients With Refractory Solid Tumors
This phase I clinical trial is studying the side effects and best dose of RO4929097 when given together with capecitabine in treating patients with refractory solid tumors. RO4929097 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving RO4929097 together with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097.

Patients receive oral gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 once daily on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17 and oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients may undergo tumor biopsy before and after treatment for biomarker analysis and blood sample collection periodically for pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenomic studies.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days (Part 1) or every 3 months (Parts 2a and 2b).
