The Role of 68Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT as a Problem Solving Imaging Modality in Various Malignancies
The aim of the suggested study is to assess the added value of 68Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT over 18F-FDG PET/CT in evaluating the extent of disease in patients with various malignancies, in whom a diagnostic challenge is met, such as inconclusive findings on 18F-FDG PET/CT or other imaging studies, better delineation of tumor extent prior to therapy, and with emphasis on malignancies known to show variable avidity to FDG and at times, no uptake at all. Also patients unable to optimally comply with the required preparation for FDG imaging, such as diabetic patients who struggle in achieving glycemic control.
