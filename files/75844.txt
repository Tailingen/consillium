Fenofibrate in Patients With Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia and Invasive Cervical Carcinoma
Normally, p53 helps prevent tumors from forming in the body. Early studies have shown that Fenofibrate, a cholesterol-lowering drug, can restore normal function to p53 and can change the metabolism of HPV-positive tumors in a way that stops the growth of tumors. The purpose of this study is to understand how Fenofibrate can be used to treat HPV-positive cervical cancers and cervical dysplasia. Researchers will examine collected tissue samples and investigate various genes and proteins to see whether Fenofibrate has an effect on HPV-positive cervical cancers and cervical dysplasia.

DRUG: Fenofibrate|PROCEDURE: Cervical Conization|PROCEDURE: Hysterectomy|RADIATION: Chemoradiation
Change in p53 levels, Changes in p53 levels from initial biopsy to repeat sampling at the time of surgery, Up to six weeks after study enrollment|Change in tumor metabolic status, Changes in tumor metabolic status from initial biopsy to repeat sampling at the time of surgery evaluated via immunohistochemical testing, Up to six weeks after study enrollment
Fenofibrate tolerability, Assess tolerability of fenofibrate by comparing lab values at baseline to values at conclusion of treatment, Up to six weeks after study enrollment
