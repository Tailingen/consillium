Axitinib (AG-013736) in Patients With Progressive, Recurrent/Metastatic Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad, a new treatment called axitinib has on the patient and adenoid cystic carcinoma. This type of cancer study is called a phase II study.

Axitinib is an oral medication that can interfere with cancer cell growth and reduce the growth of blood vessels around tumors. This study will help find out if axitinib is a useful drug for treating patients with adenoid cystic carcinomas. Axitinib is an experimental drug that has not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in adenoid cystic carcinoma.
Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma
DRUG: AG-013736 (AXITINIB)
Overall Response Rate, Best overall response rate documented by RECIST v1.1 criteria of patients with progressive, recurrent/metastatic ACC treated with axitinib. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by MRI and/or CT: Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD), neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for a Partial Response nor sufficient increase to qualify for Progression of Disease (POD); POD, 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions; Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions, 2 years
Median Progression-free Survival (PFS)., Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions", 2 years|MYB Immunohistochemistry (IHC), 2 years|Number of Participants With Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), Next generation sequencing the t(6;9) translocation (MYBNFIB gene product) status will be analyzed by Fluorescent In-Situ Hybridization (FISH) assay and correlated to clinical response. The number of participants with NGS will be recorded., 2 years
