CAR T Cells Real World Evidence Study Based on the French Hospital Claims Data Source (PMSI)
This was a Retrospective cohort study based on the PMSI data source
Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)|Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)
OTHER: KYMRIAH|OTHER: YESCARTA
Overall survival: number of events, Overall survival indicator was defined as all cause death recorded at the hospital (MSO, HAD, SSR). Patients were censored at the date of last hospitalization observed (MSO/HAD/SSR/ACE)., through study completion, approximately 2 years (January 2017 to December 2019)|Time to next treatment (TTNT) analysis: number of events, Time to next treatment indicator was defined as the time between CAR-T injection and the date of the hospitalization or palliative care., through study completion, approximately 2 years (January 2017 to December 2019)|Time to next treatment (TTNT) or death analysis: number of events, Time to next treatment or death indicator was defined as the first event occurring between TNTT or death presented during the hospitalization or palliative care., through study completion, approximately 2 years (January 2017 to December 2019)|Follow-up time between the CAR-T injection and the last hospital stay observed, Follow-up is the time between the CAR-T injection (index date) and the last hospital stay observed., through study completion, approximately 2 years (January 2017 to December 2019)|Overall cost for CAR-T hospitalization, The CAR-T hospitalization included Medical, Surgical, Obstetrics (MSO) hospitalization tariff and extra tariff linked to CAR-T treatment reimbursed by the health care insurance, through study completion, approximately 2 years (January 2017 to December 2019)
A retrospective database analysis was performed using the French national hospital claims database (Medicalized Information System Program - PMSI, 2015-2019), which includes discharge summaries for all hospital admissions in France (\~99% of French residents).

The patients were identified based on the CAR-T administration hospital stay, between 2017 and 2019. Based on the exhaustivity of the database, all patients treated with CAR-T (since 2018) were identified.

The study design included multiple periods of analysis based on the CAR-T process. Three main periods were defined: the historical period, the CAR-T period, and the post CAR-T period. The CAR-T period was divided in 2 sub-periods: pre CAR-T (including the apheresis procedure and 15 days before this procedure) and per CAR-T (including the lymphodepletion and CAR-T cell injection hospital stay until the end at the discharge date related to CAR-T cell injection hospital stay). The follow-up period started at the end of CAR-T hospital stay.
