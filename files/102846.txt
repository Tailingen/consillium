Phase I Trial of IDH1 Peptide Vaccine in IDH1R132H-mutated Grade III-IV Gliomas
The NOA-16 trial is the first-in-man trial of the IDH1 (isocitrate dehydrogenase type 1) peptide vaccine targeting the IDH1R132H mutation (amino acid exchange from arginine to glutamine at position 132 of IDH1). The aim of this trial is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of and immune response to the IDH1 peptide vaccine in patients with IDH1R132H-mutated, WHO grade III-IV gliomas.

The patient population will be molecularly defined and include IDH1R132H mutant grade III and IV gliomas without co-deletion of 1p/19q and with loss of alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX) expression.

Within this trial, the IDH1 peptide vaccine will be administered to 39 patients.

In treatment group 1 vaccination treatment will be done alone starting 4-6 weeks post radiotherapy. In treatment groups 2 and 3 vaccination treatment will be done in parallel with temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy starting at day 10 of the 4th TMZ cycle (treatment group 2) or at day 10 of the 1st TMZ cycle post concomitant radiochemotherapy (treatment group 3).
