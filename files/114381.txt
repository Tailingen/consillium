Study of Adaptive Radiotherapy for High-grade Glioma Based on Interfraction MRI
The changes of target and organs at risk in patients with high-grade glioma during concurrent chemoradiotherapy were evaluated by MRI image between radiotherapy fractions.
High-grade Glioma
DEVICE: adaptive radiotherapy
Homogeneity index, HI: Homogeneity index. Dosimetric change, up to 2 weeks|conformity index, CI: conformity index. Dosimetric change, up to 2 weeks|Anatomic change, Dmax Volume, up to 2 weeks
progression-free survival (PFS), progression-free survival, assessed up to 12 months
To prospectively evaluate the changes of target organs and risk organs in patients with high-grade glioma during concurrent chemoradiotherapy.The related factors causing this change are discussed.The relationship between changes and patient survival was analyzed.A predictive model was established to provide individualized adaptive radiotherapy for patients.
