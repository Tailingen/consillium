To assess the effect of zoledronic acid on preventing incident vertebral fractures, To assess the effect of zoledronic acid on preventing incident vertebral fractures as measured by lateral spine radiographs at 15 months post-diagnosis compared to baseline (with baseline occurring 3 months post-diagnosis). An incident vertebral fracture on lateral spine radiographs will be defined as a new fracture (Genant Grade 1 or more) in a previously normal vertebral body, or worsening of an existing fracture (increase in Genant Grade by at least 1) on the follow-up x-ray that takes place 12 months after the first dose., 15 months post-diagnosis (12 months after baseline visit)
