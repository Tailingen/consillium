DRUG: Lenalidomide|DRUG: Dexamethasone|DRUG: Dexamethasone|DRUG: Dexamethasone|BIOLOGICAL: Elotuzumab (BMS-901608; HuLuc63)
Geometric Mean Maximum Observed Serum Concentration (Cmax) of Elotuzumab Following Cycle 1, Day 1 Dose Administration - Grouping by Cockcroft-Gault Creatinine Clearance Method, The quantification of elotuzumab in human serum was performed using a validated Enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA). Cycle 1, day 1 sample times for all participants: 0 hour (h) pre-dose, end of infusion, 30 minutes (min) post end of infusion, 2 h, 4 h , and 24 h post end of infusion. Trough samples were obtained in subsequent cycles and at 30 day and 60 day follow-up visits at end of treatment. ESRD had 2 additional samples: immediately prior to and immediately after dialysis. Cmax was measured in micrograms per milliliter (µg/mL). Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameter renal function group assignment criteria differed slightly from the criteria for safety and efficacy analyses (specifically for the SRI group). PK criteria: All participants with at least one pretreatment value ≥ 90 mL/min were assigned to the NRF group. All those with at least one pretreatment value \< 30 mL/min were assigned to the SRI group. All those with a screening diagnosis of ESRD, were assigned to the ESRD group., Day 1 of Cycle 1 to 28 days post dose|Geometric Mean Area Under Serum Concentration-Time Curve From Time Zero to Time of Last Quantifiable Concentration AUC(0-T) and From Time Zero Extrapolated to Infinite Time AUC(INF) of Elotuzumab Following Cycle 1, Day 1 - Grouping by C-G CrCl Method, The quantification of elotuzumab in human serum was performed using validated ELISA. Cycle 1, day 1 sample times for all participants: 0 hour (h) pre-dose, end of infusion, 30 minutes (min) post end of infusion, 2 h, 4 h , and 24 h post end of infusion.
