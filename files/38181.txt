Early Palliative Care on Quality of Life of Advanced Cancer Patients
This study compares two types of care - Standard Oncology Care (SOC) and SOC with early palliative care (EPC) (started within 8 weeks after diagnosis of advanced disease) to see which is better for improving the quality of life of patients with advanced lung, pancreas, gastric and biliary tract cancer. The study will use FACT-G questionnaire to measure patients' quality of life.

Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) (Quality of life measure), compare change in QOL from baseline to 12 weeks between study arms, Change from baseline to 12 weeks
Survival, from date of randomization until date of death or for a minimum of six months|Resource utilization at the end of life (EOL): chemotherapy utilization, percentage of patients who died, that in the 30 days preceding the death received chemotherapy, From date of randomization until death or for a minimum of six months after enrollment|Resource utilization at the end of life (EOL): hospital admissions, percentage of patients who died, that in the 30 days preceding the death were admitted to hospital, From date of randomization until death or for a minimum of six months after enrollment|Resource utilization at the end of life (EOL): emergency room admissions, percentage of patients who died, that in the 30 days preceding the death went to the emergency room, From date of randomization until death or for a minimum of six months after enrollment
The patients will complete a baseline FACT-G questionnaire and then will be randomized to a study group.

Subjects who are randomized to Standard Oncology Care (SOC) will follow up with their treating oncologist. They will consult with the palliative care team at their request or at the request of the treating oncologist or of the family. They will complete FACT-G questionnaire at 12 weeks after enrollment.

Subjects who are randomized to the SOC with Early Palliative Care (EPC) will meet with a palliative care team (basically composed by a palliative care physician and a palliative care specialized nurse) at their next medical oncology or infusion visit. They will meet with the palliative care team at least every three weeks. They will complete FACT-G questionnaire at 12 weeks after enrollment.
