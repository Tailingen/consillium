Plasma Sphingolipid Metabolites and Radiotherapy Efficacy in Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Plasma contains a variety of metabolites, among which sphingolipids, including ceramide, sphingosine, and sphingosine-1-phosphate, serve as important intracellular second messengers and are involved in various cellular signaling pathways, such as apoptosis. We hypothesize that plasma sphingolipid levels may be associated with the efficacy of radiotherapy for liver cancer. This study will utilize LC-MS/MS technology for qualitative and quantitative analysis of plasma sphingolipids in liver cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy. Clinical data related to patient prognosis will also be collected to investigate the correlation between plasma sphingolipid levels and the therapeutic efficacy of liver cancer radiotherapy. The aim is to establish the clinical diagnostic significance of plasma sphingolipid levels in predicting the efficacy of liver cancer radiotherapy, providing new insights to enhance the effectiveness of radiotherapy in liver cancer treatment.

Disease Control Rate (DCR), Disease Control Rate (DCR) is defined as the proportion of patients who achieve complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) according to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST). mRECIST is commonly used to evaluate tumor response, especially in the context of hepatocellular carcinoma and other solid tumors. DCR is an important measure to assess the overall effectiveness of the treatment in controlling disease progression., From the start of treatment to 12 weeks post-treatment assessment
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the start of treatment to disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, as assessed by mRECIST. This endpoint measures how long patients remain free from tumor progression., From treatment initiation to the date of disease progression or death, up to 24 months.|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the start of treatment to death from any cause. This endpoint assesses the overall survival benefit of the treatment., From treatment initiation to death, up to 24 months|Safety and Tolerability, The incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be evaluated according to CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) version \[specify version\]. This endpoint assesses the safety profile of the, From the start of treatment until 90 days after the last dose.
Liver cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors worldwide, posing a significant challenge to public health. Radiotherapy plays a crucial role in controlling local recurrence and metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and improving patient survival. Advanced radiotherapy techniques such as Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) and Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) have enhanced tumor dose precision, increasing local control rates while minimizing radiation-induced side effects. However, current methods for assessing radiotherapy efficacy, including CT, MRI, and PET-CT, require extended post-treatment observation periods, delaying clinical decision-making. Additionally, radiotherapy can lead to radiation-induced liver disease (RILD) and other adverse effects such as radiation enteritis and bone marrow suppression. Therefore, identifying early predictive biomarkers for radiotherapy response and toxicity is critical for optimizing treatment strategies.

Sphingolipids, including ceramide (CER), sphingosine (SPH), and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), are essential cellular signaling molecules involved in apoptosis, proliferation, and inflammation. Studies have shown that radiotherapy influences sphingolipid metabolism by altering enzyme activity, thereby affecting the balance of CER, SPH, and S1P-key regulators of tumor cell apoptosis. With advancements in lipidomics, the role of sphingolipid metabolism in radiation sensitivity has become an area of growing interest. Sphingolipid levels have been correlated with radiotherapy sensitivity in various cancers, making them potential prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

This study is designed as a single-center, prospective observational study with a two-year follow-up period, enrolling 260 primary liver cancer patients receiving radiotherapy. Plasma samples will be collected before, during, and after radiotherapy for qualitative and quantitative analysis of sphingolipid metabolites using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS). Clinical imaging and laboratory data related to treatment response and adverse events will also be collected. Patients will be classified according to the mRECIST 1.1 criteria into complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), and progressive disease (PD) groups for further correlation analysis.

The primary objective is to investigate the relationship between plasma sphingolipid levels and radiotherapy efficacy by analyzing overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), disease-free survival (DFS), and time to progression (TTP). The secondary objective is to explore the association between sphingolipid levels and radiation-induced toxicity, including RILD, radiation enteritis, and bone marrow suppression, to assess their potential as predictive biomarkers for treatment-related complications.

Patients will be followed at 1, 2, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 months post-radiotherapy. The study does not involve any interventional treatment beyond standard clinical care, and patient management decisions will remain at the discretion of treating physicians. This research aims to provide new insights into the clinical significance of sphingolipid metabolism in predicting radiotherapy outcomes and toxicity in liver cancer, potentially improving personalized radiotherapy strategies.
