A Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of BLS-ILB-E710c in Patients With Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia 2/3 (CIN2/3)
This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of the experimental drug, BLS-ILB-E710c, in patients with Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia 2/3 (CIN2/3). 2/3 of participants will receive the experimental drug, while 1/3 of participants will receive placebo.
