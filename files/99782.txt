A Study to Assess the Effect of Ketoconazole on the Metabolism of ABT-199
This is an open-label multicenter, study to assess the pharmacokinetic interaction of ketoconazole with ABT-199 in up to 12 subjects with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
DRUG: ABT-199|DRUG: Ketoconazole
Determination of maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax), time to Cmax (peak time, Tmax), terminal phase elimination rate constant (beta), terminal phase elimination half-life (t1/2), & area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of ABT-199, Blood samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis of ABT-199 will be collected at designated timepoints to assess the PK parameters for ABT-199 alone relative to ABT-199 with ketoconazole, Measured pre-dose and up to 96 hours post-dose ABT-199
Number of subjects with adverse events, Subjects will be monitored for clinical and laboratory evidence of adverse events throughout the study, Measured up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug|Percentage of subjects with adverse events, Subjects will be monitored for clinical and laboratory evidence of adverse events throughout the study, Measured up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug|Change in physical exam finding, including vital signs, Body temperature, weight, blood pressure, heart rate, Measured from Day 1 up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug|Change in clinical laboratory test results, Chemistry, coagulation, hematology, urinalysis, Measured from Day 1 up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug|Change in cardiac assessment findings, Electrocardiogram, Measured from Day 1 up to Day 12
This is a Phase 1 study designed to assess how the body processes the study drug ABT-199 when taken alone and in combination with ketoconazole and to assess the safety of ABT-199 in combination with ketoconazole. Subjects may enroll in a separate extension study to continue receiving ABT-199 after completion of this study.
