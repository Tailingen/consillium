Intravenous (IV) Decitabine and Oral Bexarotene for Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML)
The main objective is to determine the safety and tolerability of combination decitabine and bexarotene during four cycles of therapy.

The investigators are seeking to study the combination of decitabine and bexarotene. These two agents have each shown efficacy in decreasing leukemic blast counts and restoring normal hematopoiesis via different mechanisms of action and with non-overlapping side-effect profiles. By combining these agents, the investigators hope to improve overall response rates. The investigators further hope to improve platelet and neutrophil counts in an even greater number of patients, thus treating two of the most important sources of morbidity and mortality in this patient population.
