Toremifene Citrate for Prevention of Bone Fractures in Men With Prostate Cancer on Androgen Deprivation Therapy
Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) treatment for prostate cancer decreases the natural hormone called testosterone. This type of therapy is very effective for the treatment of prostate cancer. However, one of the side effects is bone loss or thinning of the bones that can lead to osteoporosis and an increased risk of bone fractures (breaking of the bones). The purpose of the study is to determine whether or not the addition of toremifene citrate (the study drug) to therapy can prevent or decrease the number of bone fractures and to evaluate its impact on side effects associated with testosterone reduction therapy.
