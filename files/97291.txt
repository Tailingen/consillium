The original base protocol (V501-018)(NCT00092547) was extended in amendments V501-018-05 and -06 to provide 37 months of follow-up. Additionally, subjects in the Placebo Group during the base study were given 3 doses of open-label GARDASIL™ (V501) at Months 30, 32, and 36.

The study was extended again in amendment V501-018-10(NCT00092547), titled "A Long Term Immunogenicity, Safety, and Effectiveness Study of GARDASIL (Human Papillomavirus \[Types 6, 11, 16, 18\] Recombinant Vaccine) Among Adolescents Who Received GARDASIL at 9-18 Years of Age" to allow a follow-up period to Month 126.
