ECP-1014 Treatment for Patients With Solid Tumor Cancers
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and optimal recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) during a 28-day dosing period of ECP-1014 in patients with solid tumors and by evaluation of dose limiting toxicities.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: ECP-1014
This is a safety and tolerability-based study in which the MTD may be determined, All AEs will be classified with respect to the MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC) and preferred term. The number and percent of patients who report treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will be summarized for each treatment group. Additional summaries by severity, relationship, and subgroup will be presented. Serious AEs (SAEs) will be summarized similarly. Clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis will be preformed and changes will be compared to baseline., 28 days
Plasma for Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax), A 24-hour intensive blood plasma sampling for pharmacokinetic concentration determination will be performed on Day 1 at Hours 0 (immediately pre-morning dose), and Hours 0.5, 1.0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18 and 24. Patients will be required to remain in-clinic overnight for this sampling.

The patient will return to the clinic on the morning of Day 5 after fasting from the evening before. Following the Hour 0 (trough) PK sample, the subject will be given their morning dose of study medication. Additional PK samples will be collected at Hours 0.5, 1.0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18 and 24., Day 1 at Hours 0 (immediately pre-morning dose), and Hours 0.5, 1.0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18 and 24. The patient will return to the clinic on the morning of Day 5 after fasting|Urine for PGE-M levels, Exploratory biomarkers such as urinary PGE-M will be measured to assess the pharmacodynamic effects of the investigational drug. Starting the morning of Day 4 through the morning of Day 5, a 24-hour urine collection will be performed to allow for assessment of ECP-1014 and metabolite excretion., Pretreatment, Days 5 & 28|Plasma for Area Under the Curve (AUC), A 24-hour intensive blood plasma sampling for pharmacokinetic concentration determination will be performed on Day 1 at Hours 0 (immediately pre-morning dose), and Hours 0.5, 1.0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18 and 24. Patients will be required to remain in-clinic overnight for this sampling.

The patient will return to the clinic on the morning of Day 5 after fasting from the evening before. Following the Hour 0 (trough) PK sample, the subject will be given their morning dose of study medication. Additional PK samples will be collected at Hours 0.5, 1.0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18 and 24., Day 1 at Hours 0 (immediately pre-morning dose), and Hours 0.5, 1.0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18 and 24. The patient will return to the clinic on the morning of Day 5 after fasting|Plasma for Half-life (t1/2), A 24-hour intensive blood plasma sampling for pharmacokinetic concentration determination will be performed on Day 1 at Hours 0 (immediately pre-morning dose), and Hours 0.5, 1.0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18 and 24. Patients will be required to remain in-clinic overnight for this sampling.

The patient will return to the clinic on the morning of Day 5 after fasting|Plasma for Time to Maximum Plasma Concentration (Tmax), A 24-hour intensive blood plasma sampling for pharmacokinetic concentration determination will be performed on Day 1 at Hours 0 (immediately pre-morning dose), and Hours 0.5, 1.0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18 and 24.

The patient will return to the clinic on the morning of Day 5 after fasting
This is a single arm, single-center, open-label, ascending dose study in which dose escalation will be determined based on safety and tolerability. Up to a total of 6 cohorts of patients will be enrolled unless additional intermediate doses are studied, not to exceed the maximal dose per protocol.

There are 2 Parts to this study.

* Part 1 involves enrolling sequential cohorts of patients into a dose-escalation design, in which doses are assessed for safety/tolerability.
* Part 2 involves randomizing a cohort of patients to the highest and second-highest tolerated doses as identified in Part 1.
