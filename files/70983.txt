Study of IPI-145 in Combination With Rituximab or Bendamustine/Rituximab in Hematologic Malignancies
The goal of this study is to characterize the safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and preliminary efficacy profile of IPI-145 given in combination with rituximab, or bendamustine plus rituximab, to subjects with select relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancies.
Lymphoma|Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma|T-cell Lymphoma
DRUG: IPI-145|DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Bendamustine
The number of adverse events, serious adverse events, and dose limiting toxicities as a measure of safety and tolerability, The maximum tolerated dose of IPI-145 defined as the optimal dose at which â‰¤1 of 6 patients experiences a DLT assessed by NCI CTCAE v4.0., up to 12 months
Antitumor activity, Preliminary information on antitumor activity of IPI-145 when combined with rituximab, or bendamustine/rituximab as measured by objective response rate, progression free survival and overall survival data, Up to 5 years
PK of IPI-145 and its metabolites, Pharmacokinetics (PK) of IPI-145 and its metabolites when combined with rituximab or bendamustine/rituximab will be obtained by evaluating maximum concentration and area under the curve pre-dose and up to 6 hours post-dose., Day 1|PDx of IPI-145, Pharmacodynamics (PDx) of IPI-145 when combined with rituximab or bendamustine/rituximab will be evaluated by assessing chemokines and cytokines., Up to 12 months|Molecular predictors of IPI-145, Develop molecular predictors of response when IPI-145 is combined with rituximab or bendamustine/rituximab by assessing protein expression and potential mutations., Up to 12 months
This trial consists of two parallel arms. For each treatment arm, a 3+3 dose escalation design will be applied in 3-6 subject cohorts until the maximum tolerated dose of IPI-145 when given with rituximab (Arm 1) or in combination with rituximab and bendamustine (Arm 2) is determined. Treatment arm selection will be chosen by the investigator and will depend on the agents previously administered to the subject. Once the MTD has been determined, the arms will move on to a dose expansion phase. During the dose expansion phase, each treatment arm will enroll to population specific cohorts to assess efficacy. All subjects must have had at least one prior anticancer treatment. The dose expansion cohorts are:

Arm 1: Cohort A - CLL: Cohort B - CD20+ NHL

Arm 2: Cohort A - CLL: Cohort B - CD20+ NHL
