Remote Symptom Monitoring on Patient-Reported Outcomes With Nudge Strategies Among Patients With Tumor in China
The goal of this clinical trial is to design a digital PRO intervention model applicable to patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, and The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Can symptom management through patients' regular completion of the PRO scale promote self-understanding, self-management and timely seeking of medical help, enable healthcare professionals to accurately and efficiently understand how patients really feel and respond in a timely manner, and ultimately improve health outcomes?
* Can digital interventions significantly improve outcomes such as symptom control and quality of life in cancer patients? Researchers divided participants into an intervention group and a control group and compared them to see if digital interventions could improve patient health outcomes.

Participants will:

* Subjects in the intervention group will be asked to report symptom information weekly (7-day natural week, hereafter) via the public number, and the back office will give symptom management advice or issue alerts based on the filling. Control subjects will not receive PRO intervention.
* Participants can offer to withdraw from the study at any time.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)
BEHAVIORAL: Digitized patient-reported outcomes
Health-Related quality of life, EORTC QLQ-C30 Quality of Life Scale(European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire) The EORTC QLQ-C30 (Version 3) uses for the questions 1 to 28 a 4-point scale. The scale scores from 1 to 4: 1 ("Not at all"), 2 ("A little"), 3 ("Quite a bit") and 4 ("Very much"). Half points are not allowed. The range is 3. For the raw score, less points are considered to have a better outcome.

The EORTC QLQ-C30 (Version 3) uses for the questions 29 and 30 a 7-points scale. The scale scores from 1 to 7: 1 ("very poor") to 7 ("excellent"). Half points are not allowed. The range is 6. First of all, raw score has to be calculated with mean values. Afterwards linear transformation is performed to be comparable. More points are considered to have a better outcome., 6 months
Change in patient-reported hepatocellular carcinoma symptoms, PRO questionnaire, 6 months|Mental health, PHQ-9 Scale((Patient Health Questionnaire-9) The total score can range from 0 to 27. Higher scores indicate greater severity of depression., 6 months|Survival period, 6 months|Treatment satisfaction, PRO questionnaire, 6 months|Treatment compliance, The Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8) The total score of the MMAS-8 scale is the sum of the scores of 8 questions. The score range is 0 to 8 points. The higher the score, the better the medication compliance. A score of 8 indicates good compliance; A score of 6 to 7 indicates moderate compliance. A score less than 6 indicates poor compliance., 6 months|The number of times the official account functions are used, The native statistics system of the WeChat Official Account backend, 6 months|The number of visits to the outpatient department, inpatient department and emergency department, PRO questionnaire, 6 months|Direct medical costs, 6 months|Direct non-medical costs, 6 months|Indirect cost, 6 months|Health State Utility, EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L) The scale measures quality of life on a 5-component scale.For each dimension, based on the level selected by the respondents, the score for that level is given respectively, with the highest being 5 points and the lowest being 1 point. Then add up the scores of all dimensions to obtain the score of the entire rating scale, with a maximum of 25 points and a minimum of 5 points.The higher the score, the lower the health state utility., 6 months
