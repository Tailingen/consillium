Immune Monitoring on Sipuleucel-T
The purpose of this protocol is perform comprehensive immune monitoring studies in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer receiving Sipuleucel-T in an effort to better understand the mechanism of action of this treatment.
Prostate Cancer
Change in Regulatory T cells (Tregs), Establish the phenotype and frequency of circulating immune cell compartments in patients undergoing treatment with Sipuleucel-T looking at the change in regulatory T cells at 1 year post treatment compared to at baseline, baseline and 1 year
Change in Antigen Presenting Cells, Establish the phenotype and frequency of circulating immune cell compartments in patients undergoing treatment with Sipuleucel-T looking at the change in antigen presenting cells: DCs and B cells at 1 year post treatment compared to at baseline, baseline and 1 year|Change in Prostate Antigen-specific T Cell Immunity, baseline and one year|Whole-blood RNA transcript-based signatures, whole-blood RNA transcript-based signatures correlate with overall survival, baseline|Whole-blood RNA transcript-based signatures, whole-blood RNA transcript-based signatures correlate with overall survival, up to 1 year|Change in cytokine milieu, baseline and 1 year|Change in chemokine milieu, baseline and 1 year
The primary objectives of this study are to:

1. Establish the phenotype and frequency of circulating immune cell compartments in patients undergoing treatment with Sipuleucel-T.
2. Determine the induction and the quality of prostate antigen-specific T cell immunity in patients undergoing treatment with Sipuleucel-T.
3. Correlate whole-blood RNA transcript-based signatures with clinical outcomes in patients treated with Sipuleucel-T.
4. Evaluate the cytokine and chemokine milieu in the peripheral blood pre- and post-treatment with Sipuleucel-T.
