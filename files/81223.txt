A Pediatric Trial Using Tranexamic Acid in Thrombocytopenia
This study evaluates the use of tranexamic acid (TXA) in addition to standard therapy in children receiving chemotherapy or blood and/or marrow transplantation to decrease the risk of bleeding. Half of participants will receive tranexamic acid and half of participants will receive placebo.
Pediatric Cancer|Thrombocytopenia|Hemostatic Disorder|Coagulation Defect; Acquired
DRUG: Tranexamic Acid|DRUG: Normal saline
Safety and Tolerability of Tranexamic Acid in Participants as the Number of Patients With Any Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) as Assessed by CTCAE v4.03, Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) will be collected on subjects throughout their participation in the study and up to 30 days following discontinuation of the study drug, regardless of attribution. Adverse events and serious adverse events will be tabulated by type and grade according to the NCI CTCAE v 4.03.

The hypothesis is that tranexamic acid can be safely added to standard care regimens in patients with hematologic malignancies or solid tumors during periods of severe thrombocytopenia. Analysis limited to a descriptive assessment of the safety of tranexamic acid in patients with hematologic malignancies or solid tumors by reported adverse events, serious adverse events and death., From activation of the study drug (maximum 30 days) through 30 days from discontinuation of study drug|Feasibility of Tranexamic Acid as an Adjunct to Standard Therapy: Number of Participants Eligible and Recruited, Number of participants eligible for study enrollment and recruited.

The hypothesis is that tranexamic acid can be safely added to standard care regimens in patients with hematologic malignancies or solid tumors during periods of severe thrombocytopenia. A descriptive assessment of feasibility of recruitment by monitoring number of patients screened, number of patients eligible for enrollment and rate of recruitment (both start-up and ongoing) during study period to be completed by collecting data on the number of patients screened, the number of patients eligible for study inclusion, the number of eligible patients who consent to study inclusion and the number of consented patients activated to the study drug, organized in visual form by CONSORT diagram., From time of recruitment of the first patient until the last patient is enrolled, up to 16 months in duration
World Health Organization (WHO) Bleeding Scale Grade 2 or Higher Bleeding, Proportion of patients with bleeding of WHO grade 2 or above, after activation of study drug. Bleeding graded on a scale ranging from 1 (minor bleeding) through 4 (bleeding that is fatal or life-threatening)., 30 days after activation of study drug|Number of Platelet and Red Blood Cell Transfusions, Number of platelet and red blood cell transfusions per patient during the first 30 days post prescription activation of study drug, 30 days after activation of study drug|Number of Days Alive and Without WHO Grade 2 Bleeding or Greater, Number of days alive and without WHO grade 2 bleeding or greater during the first 30 days post activation of study drug. Bleeding graded on a scale ranging from 1 (minor bleeding) through 4 (bleeding that is fatal or life-threatening)., 30 days after activation of study drug|The Occurrence of Thromboembolic Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events, Any venous or arterial thrombosis on standard diagnostic imaging post-randomization, From activation of the study drug (maximum 30 days) through 30 days from discontinuation of study drug|Bleeding of Any Grade, Proportion of patients with bleeding of any grade as assessed by WHO bleeding score, after activation of study drug, From activation of the study drug (maximum 30 days) through 30 days from discontinuation of study drug|Highest Observed Grade of Bleeding (as Measured on WHO Bleeding Scale) During the Study Period, Highest grade of bleeding (as measured on WHO bleeding scale) during study period in each enrolled patient. Bleeding graded on a scale ranging from 1 (minor bleeding) through 4 (bleeding that is fatal or life-threatening)., From activation of the study drug (maximum 30 days) through 30 days from discontinuation of study drug
The purpose of this study is to conduct a prospective, randomized, blinded, placebo controlled trial to evaluate the safety and feasibility of the addition of antifibrinolytic therapy with tranexamic acid to the standard care in patients who are thrombocytopenic due to primary bone marrow disorders or chemotherapy, immunotherapy and/or radiation therapy in order to prevent bleeding. The results of this study will change practice by providing evidence as to whether or not TXA is effective and safe treatment when used as an adjunct to platelet transfusion therapy in the thrombocytopenic patient.
