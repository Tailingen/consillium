Study on the Composite Endpoint Event of PCSK9 Inhibitor in Patients With Very High Risk of ASCVD and Cancer
This study is a prospective, randomized, open-label, and single center trial. To evaluate the effect of treatment with PCSK9 inhibitor on the risk for cardiovascular death, recurrent unstable angina, myocardial infarction, stroke, or coronary revascularization in patients with very high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and cancer.
ASCVD|Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease|Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 9 Inhibitor|Cancer
DRUG: Evolocumab|DRUG: Statin
Major cardiovascular adverse events, Major cardiovascular adverse events include cardiovascular death, recurrent unstable angina, myocardial infarction, stroke, and coronary revascularization, From date of randomization until the date of first documented endpoint or date of completion of follow-up, whichever came first, assessed up to 48 weeks
All cause death, All cause death, From date of randomization until the date of first documented endpoint or date of completion of follow-up, whichever came first, assessed up to 48 weeks|Composite end points, Composite end points include cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest, malignant arrhythmia, heart failure, Non-coronary revascularization, From date of randomization until the date of first documented endpoint or date of completion of follow-up, whichever came first, assessed up to 48 weeks|The compliance rate of lipid control, Main indicator: LDL-C decreased to below 1.4 mmol/L and decreased by more than 50% from baseline; secondary indicator: non HDL-C\<2.2 mmol/L;, From date of randomization until the date of first documented endpoint or date of completion of follow-up, whichever came first, assessed up to 48 weeks|The changes of carotid plaque, By carotid ultrasound, From date of randomization until the date of first documented endpoint or date of completion of follow-up, whichever came first, assessed up to 48 weeks
Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive subcutaneous injections of PCSK9 inhibitor (evolocumab:420 mg every 4 weeks) plus moderate intensity statin therapy or the statin alone therapy. After randomization, patients will come to the hospital every 4 weeks to collect relevant laboratory results and clinical outcomes, and be detected by echocardiography and carotid ultrasound every 12 weeks until the end of follow-up at week 48 or the occurrence of an endpoint event. The entire study is expected to be conducted for 3 years, with a recruitment period of 2 years.
