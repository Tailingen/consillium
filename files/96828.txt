Lutathera in People With Gastroenteropancreatic (GEP), Bronchial or Unknown Primary Neuroendocrine Tumors That Have Spread to the Liver
This study will look at whether it is practical and safe to give Lutathera directly into an artery of the liver (hepatic intraarterial infusion). The researchers will compare the effects of hepatic intraarterial infusion in the liver with the effects of the standard approach (intravenous infusion in the arm). The researchers will also determine whether Lutathera is effective against participants' cancer.
