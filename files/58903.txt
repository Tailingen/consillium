Scores for each scale and single-item range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating higher level of symptoms. TTDD for chest pain, cough and dyspnea was defined as the time from randomization to the date of event, which was defined as at least 10 points absolute worsening from baseline of the corresponding scale score, with no later change below this threshold ie.\<10 points was observed, or if this worsening was observed at the last assessment for the subject, or death due to any cause (whichever occurred earlier). If a subject did not have an event, TTDD was censored at the last adequate assessment., Up to approximately 25 months|Part 2 (Double-blind, Randomized, Placebo-controlled): Time to Definitive Deterioration in Global Health Status/Quality of Life, Shortness of Breath and Pain Per EORTC QLQ-C30 Questionnaire, The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30) is a questionnaire developed to assess the health-related quality of life of cancer participants. It assesses 15 domains consisting of 5 functional domains (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, social) and 9 symptom domains (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, financial difficulties) and a global health status/QoL scale. All domain scores range from 0 to 100. A high score for the functional or global health status scales indicates a high level of functioning or QoL; a high score for a symptom scale indicates a high level of symptoms., Up to approximately 25 months|Part 2 (Double-blind, Randomized, Placebo-controlled): Change From Baseline in Score as Per the EuroQol 5 Dimension 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) Questionnaire, The EQ-5D-5L questionnaire is a standardized measure of health status developed by the EuroQol Group in order to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal. The EQ-5D-5L measures 5 items on mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression, measured on 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. A utility index can be computed from the EQ 5D-5L descriptive system with utility scores ranging from -0.281 (worst imaginable health state) to 1 (best imaginable health state), with -0.281 representing an "unconscious" health state. A single index value is analyzed for the EQ-5D-5L score. An increase from baseline in the EQ-ED-5L utility index is indicative of an improvement.). CFB = change from baseline, Assessed every 3 weeks from Week 3 through Week 108, at follow-up visits 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 (follow-up visits occurred every 26 days from week 108), and at 7 and 28 days post-disease progression, all up to a maximum of 3.5 years|Part 2 (Double-blind, Randomized, Placebo-controlled): Change From Baseline in Score as Per the EuroQol 5 Dimension 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) Questionnaire - Visual Analog Scale (VAS), The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized questionnaire used to assess health-related quality of life, and it includes a Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The VAS score is obtained by asking the individual to rate their current health status on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst possible health state and 100 represents the best possible health state.

The change from baseline in EQ-5D-5L VAS score was calculated. A positive change from baseline indicates improvement in the health status. CFB = change from baseline, Assessed every 3 weeks from Week 3 through Week 108, at follow-up visits 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 (follow-up visits occurred every 26 days from week 108), and at 7 and 28 days post-disease progression, all up to a maximum of 3.5 years|All Collected Deaths, On-treatment deaths due to any cause were collected from first dose of study medication to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment. Post-treatment survival follow-up deaths were collected from Day 31 after last dose of study medication to the data cut-off date., On-treatment deaths: Up to approximately 29 months in Part 1 or approximately 25 months in Part 2. Post-treatment survival follow-up deaths: Up to an additional 130 days.
The study primarily assessed the safety and tolerability (safety run-in Part A) of pembrolizumab plus platinum-based doublet chemotherapy with canakinumab, and then, the efficacy (double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Part B) of pembrolizumab plus platinum-based doublet chemotherapy with or without canakinumab.
