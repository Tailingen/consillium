Niraparib Plus Aromatase Inhibitors for Luminal-like(HER2-,ER+) and gBRCA or HDR+ Metastatic Breast Cancer (LUZERN)
This study evalues the efficacy -as determined by the clinical benefit rate (CBR)- of niraparib in combination with AIs in unresectable locally advanced or metastatic HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer patients harboring either gBRCAms or gBRCAwt and HRD.

The planned number of patients is 23.

Investigational product is Niraparib and will be administered daily continuously in 28-day cycles plus aromatase Inhibitors.

Total study duration is 36 months and until 5 years of follow up.

Clinical benefit rate (CBR) of niraparib in combination with AIs in unresectable locally advanced or metastatic HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer patients harboring either gBRCAms or gBRCAwt and HRD, The CBR as best response, defined as the percentage of patients who experience a complete response, partial response or stable disease for at least 24 weeks and assessed by modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) criteria, Baseline up to 24 weeks
Efficacy determinated by the Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of the first dose of study treatment until the first documented PD based on RECIST v1.1. or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first based on local investigator's assessment according to RECIST criteria v1.1., Baseline up to 36 months|Efficacy determinated by the Objective Response Rate (ORR), The ORR is defined as the number of patients with CR and PR divided by the number of patients in the analysis set. Tumor response will be defined as best response based on local investigator's assessment according to RECIST criteria v.1.1., Baseline up to 36 months|Efficacy determined by Duration of Response (DoR), DoR is defined as the time from first documented CR or PR until disease progression or death from any cause, based on local investigator's assessment according to RECIST criteria v1.1., Baseline up to 36 months|Efficacy determined by Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of first dose of study treatment until death by any cause or the last date the patient was known to be alive., Baseline up to 36 months|Efficacy determined by Time to response (TTR), Time to response (TTR) is defined as the time from the date of first dose of study treatment to the first objective tumor response observed for patients who achieved a Complete response (CR) or parcial response (PR)., Baseline up to 36 months|Incidence of treatment-related AEs Grade 3 and 4 and serious adverse events (SAEs) [Safety], Safety will be measured by using the National Cancer Institute (NCI)-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v.5.0., Baseline up to 36 months
This is a Multicenter, Open-label, Phase II Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Niraparib plus Aromatase Inhibitors for Hormone Receptor (HR)-positive/Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2)-negative Metastatic Breast Cancers with either Germline BRCA-mutated or Germinal BRCA-wild-type and Homologous Recombination Deficiency (HRD).

The main objetive is to assess the efficacy -as determined by the clinical benefit rate (CBR)- of niraparib in combination with AIs in unresectable locally advanced or metastatic HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer patients harboring either gBRCAms or gBRCAwt and HRD.

Upon meeting all selection criteria, patients enrolled in the study will receive the combination of niraparib orally (according to baseline criteria described in Table 4), once daily, flat- fixed, continuously in 28-day cycles and AI that must be identical to the last AI-containing regimen.

A total of 23 patients will be recruited as follows:

* Stage I: N=6 patients in the cohort A;
* Stage II: N=8 patients in the cohort A; N=9 patients in the exploratory cohort B

The total duration of the study period is 36 months follow until 5 years of follow up.
