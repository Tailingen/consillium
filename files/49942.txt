OPPOSITE: Outcome Prediction of Systemic Treatment in Esophagogastric Carcinoma
Patients with locally advanced, resectable gastric or esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma will receive a biopsy of the primary tumor, followed by standard-of care neoadjuvant systemic treatment; after neoadjuvant therapy tumor biopsies will be taken from different sites of the resection specimen.

* Aim 1: Organoid cultures of pre-treatment tumor biopsies will be established and exposed to the same chemotherapy as the corresponding patient; in vitro response to treatment will be correlated with the in vivo response of patients.
* Aim 2: Whole genome, methylome and RNA sequencing of tumors biopsies and organoids will be performed prior to as well as after systemic treatment. Histological and clinical outcome will be correlated with molecular subtypes.

PROCEDURE: Biopsy
Aim 1: Correlation of in-vitro response in the organoid model with histological regression in the resected tumor, Correlation of in-vitro response to cytotoxic chemotherapy in the patient-derived organoid model with histological regression in the resected specimen and analysis of reliability of this organoid model in predicting patients' response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy., 1 year|Aim 2: Correlation of molecular subtypes with histological response after neoadjuvant therapy in patients, Prognostic impact of the molecular subtypes on histological response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients will be modeled using the logistic regression., 1 year
Aim 1: Correlation of in-vitro response in the organoid model with relapse-free survival, The possible prognostic impact of in-vitro response in the organoid model on relapse-free survival will be investigated using the Cox proportional hazards models., maximum 5 years|Aim 2: Correlation of molecular subtypes with relapse-free survival, The possible prognostic impact of molecular subtypes on relapse-free survival will be investigated using the Cox proportional hazards models., maximum 5 years
Aim 1: Correlation of in-vitro response in the organoid model with overall survival, The possible prognostic impact of in-vitro response in the organoid model on overall survival will be investigated using the Cox proportional hazards models., maximum 5 years|Aim 2: Correlation of molecular subtypes with overall survival, The possible prognostic impact of molecular subtypes on overall survival will be investigated using the Cox proportional hazards models., maximum 5 years
