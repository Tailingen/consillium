Assessment of the Fungal Infection Incidence Across Canada for High Risk Participants With Hematological Disease (P07501)
This will be a retrospective study that includes retrospective chart reviews at major institutions across Canada. The intent of the study is to generate both regional and national incidence data for non-Candida invasive fungal infections (IFI) in high risk participants. The study will include participants receiving stem cell transplant and high dose chemotherapy treatment for leukemia.
