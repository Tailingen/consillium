Chimeric Natural Killer Receptor-Universal T Cells for Relapsed or Refractory Neuroblastoma
This is a single arm, open-label, multi-center, pilot studies (Investigator Initiated Trial, IIT) to evaluate the safety, preliminary efficacy, pharmacokinetics of universal T-cells engineered with chimeric natural killer receptor (CNK-UT) to treat the patients with relapsed/refractory Neuroblastoma.
Neuroblastoma, Recurrent, Refractory
DRUG: Chimeric Natural Killer Receptor Universal T-cells (CNK-UT)
Incidence of Treatment Related adverse events (AEs), Incidence of Treatment Related AEs, AEs of special interest and serious adverse events (SAEs) assessed by NCI-CTCAE v5.0 criteria, up to 1 year
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Overall response is defined as either a complete or partial response (CR+PR), the response should be confirmed no less than 4 weeks after the first evaluation., up to 1 year|Duration of Response (DOR), The period from the first evaluation of CR or PR to the first evaluation of PD or death of any cause., up to 1 year|Disease control rate (DCR), The number of cases in which response are achieved from the start of cells infusion/the total number of evaluable cases (%)., up to 1 year|Progression-free Survival (PFS), The period from the day when the participant receives the cell therapy to the first recorded disease progression (whether treated or not) or death of any cause, which occurs first., up to 1 year|Overall survival (OS), The period from the first infusion to any cause of death., up to 1 year|Pharmacokinetics (PK) (Cmax), The Peak Plasma concentration (Cmax) of amplified CNK-UT DNA in peripheral blood after infusion., up to 1 year|Pharmacokinetics (PK) (Tmax), The time to reach the maximum concentration (Tmax)., up to 1 year
biomarkers, Ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), neuron specific enolase (NSE) will be analyzed., up to 1 year|Levels of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets, Percentage of T cell、B cell、NK Cells、Treg cell and MDSC in peripheral blood detected by FCM after infusion., up to 1 year
This is a single arm, open-label, phase I, dose escalation/dose expansion study to assess the safety of CNK-UT cells therapy, and to obtain the preliminary efficacy and pharmacokinetics result in participants who have been diagnosed with relapsed/refractory Neuroblastoma.
