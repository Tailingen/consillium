A Study of BL-M02D1 in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer or Other Solid Tumors
Phase Ib: To explore the safety and preliminary efficacy of BL-M02D1 to further define RP2D in a variety of solid tumors such as locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Phase II: To explore the efficacy of BL-M02D1 using single-agent RP2D obtained from phase I clinical studies.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: BL-M02D1
Phase Ib: Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D), The RP2D is defined as the dose level chosen by the sponsor (in consultation with the investigators) for phase II study, based on safety, tolerability, efficacy, PK, and PD data collected during the dose escalation study of BL-M02D1., Up to 21 days after the first dose|Phase II: Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants, who has a CR (disappearance of all target lesions) or PR (at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions). The percentage of participants who experiences a confirmed CR or PR is according to RECIST 1.1., Up to approximately 24 months
Treatment-Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE), TEAE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally emerging, or any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition during the treatment of BL-M02D1. The type, frequency and severity of TEAE will be evaluated during the treatment of BL-M02D1., Up to approximately 24 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), The DCR is defined as the percentage of participants who has a CR, PR, or Stable Disease (SD: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease \[PD: at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD\])., Up to approximately 24 months|Duration of Response (DOR), The DOR for a responder is defined as the time from the participant's initial objective response to the first date of either disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 24 months|Phase Ib: Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants, who has a CR (disappearance of all target lesions) or PR (at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions). The percentage of participants who experiences a confirmed CR or PR is according to RECIST 1.1., Up to approximately 24 months|Phase II: Progression-free Survival (PFS), The PFS is defined as the time from the participant's first dose of BL-M02D1 to the first date of either disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 24 months|Cmax, Maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of BL-M02D1 will be investigated., Up to 21 days after the first dose|Tmax, Time to maximum serum concentration (Tmax) of BL-M02D1 will be investigated., Up to 21 days after the first dose|Ctrough, Ctough is defined as the lowest serum concentration of BL-M02D1 prior to the next dose will be administered., Up to 21 days after the first dose|Phase Ib: T1/2, Half-life (T1/2) of BL-M02D1 will be investigated., Up to 21 days after the first dose|Phase Ib: AUC0-T, AUC0-t is defined as area under the serum concentration-time curve from time 0 to the time of the last measurable concentration., Up to 21 days after the first dose|Phase Ib: CL, CL in the serum of BL-M02D1 per unit of time will be investigated., Up to 21 days after the first dose|ADA (anti-drug antibody), Frequency of anti-BL-M02D1 antibody (ADA) will be investigated., Up to approximately 24 months
