Early Intrapleural TPA Instillation Versus Late
Chest tubes are used for air or fluid removal from the pleural space. When a chest tube is placed, it can be hard for the fluid to drain.Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and DNase are given through the chest tube to help with draining the fluid. We are doing this research to see if early addition of tPA-DNase immediately after chest tube placement will help with better fluid draining.
Tissue Plasminogen Activator
COMBINATION_PRODUCT: early tPA and DNase
Chest tube removal, Time to chest tube removal, 7 days
Fluid drainage, Volume of fluid drained after each tPA and DNase instillation, 3 days|Need for other interventions, Post tPA/DNase administration, the need for other interventions, such as surgery or additional chest tube, will be determined., 4 days|Discharge, Time to discharge, 3 weeks
The purpose of this study is to determine the timing and efficacy of early administration and late administration of t-PA/DNase via thoracostomy (n=60). Patients will be identified from the Intensive Care Unit, Coronary Care Unit, and wards/stepdown units. Prior to chest tube placement, patients will be randomized to one of the two treatment arms (early use of t-PA-DNase verus late use of t-PA-DNase). Route of administration will be via their thoracostomy tube over a period of three days twice daily.
