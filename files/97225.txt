Outcome Study of Double Bare Stent for Malignant Gastric Outlet Obstruction
Self-expandable metallic stents provide effective palliation of malignant gastric outlet obstruction. However, uncovered stent are often associated with re-stenosis caused by tumor in-growth through the stent mesh. The Self-expandable metallic stents which has the design of smaller wire mesh size (double bare stent) were developed and used in Korea. This new design was developed to minimize the re-stenosis of uncovered stent, but the outcome is unknown. The end point of this study is the 8-weeks patency rate after placement of double bare as well as technical and clinical success rates.
