The CR, CRi, or PR are defined in the above outcome measure. For CLL/SLL, PD is defined as lympho \>=50% increase from baseline with \>= 5000 B lymphocytes/µL, progressive cytopenias by bone marrow biopsy, appearance of any new lesion or new appearance of hepatomegaly or splenomegaly or \>= 50 % increase in lymphadenopathy/hepatomegaly/splenomegaly, platelets decrease of \>=50% from baseline secondary to CLL or \< 100,000/µL and worsening bone marrow or Hb decrease of \> 2 g/dL from baseline secondary to CLL or decrease to less than 100 g/L and worsening bone marrow. For RS, PD is defined as an increase by 25 % in longest diameter, new lesion or assessable disease progression. The DoR was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method., Day 1 through the final data cutoff date (approximately 7 years 6 months)|Progression Free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by the Investigator, The PFS is defined as the time from the date of first dose of study drug to the date of first PD or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first.
