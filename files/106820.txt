Phase 1 Open-label Study of TRX518 Monotherapy and TRX518 in Combination With Gemcitabine, Pembrolizumab, or Nivolumab
This study will be conducted in 5 parts (Parts A, B, C, D and E).

Monotherapy Treatment:

Subjects ≥18 years with advanced solid tumors will be enrolled in the study. Monotherapy dose escalation will be performed in Part A. Cycle 1 data from each cohort will be evaluated for safety and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) prior to dose escalation. Subjects will be assigned to a cohort in the order screening is completed. Dose will depend upon the cohort in which a patient is enrolled and cohorts will be dosed consecutively by ascending dose. Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) has been identified, an expanded cohort will be enrolled (Part B).

Combination Treatment:

Subjects ≥18 years with advanced solid tumors will be enrolled in the study. Subjects will receive TRX518 in combination with gemcitabine (Part C), pembrolizumab (Part D), or nivolumab (Part E). Dose escalation will be performed for each part (Part Cesc, Part Desc, Part Eesc) and Cycle 1 data from each cohort will be evaluated for safety and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) prior to dose escalation. Subjects will be assigned to a cohort in the order screening is completed. Dose will depend upon the cohort in which a patient is enrolled and cohorts will be dosed consecutively by ascending dose. Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) has been identified, an expanded cohort will be enrolled (Part Cexp, Part Dexp, Part Eexp).
