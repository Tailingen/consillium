A Study of Combination Amivantamab and Carboplatin-Pemetrexed Therapy, Compared With Carboplatin-Pemetrexed, in Participants With Advanced or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Characterized by Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Exon 20 Insertions
The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy, as demonstrated by progression-free survival (PFS), in participants treated with amivantamab in combination with chemotherapy, versus chemotherapy alone in participants with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) characterized by EGFR Exon 20ins mutations.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
DRUG: Amivantamab|DRUG: Pemetrexed|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Pemetrexed
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 as Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), PFS was defined as the time from randomization until the date of objective disease progression based on BICR using RECIST version 1.1 or death (by any cause) in the absence of progression, whichever came first. Participants who have not progressed or have not died at the time of analysis were censored at the time of the latest date of their last evaluable RECIST version 1.1 assessment. Pharmacodynamic: Sum of diameters increased by greater than or equal to (\>=)20 percent (%) and \>=5 millimeter (mm) from nadir (including baseline if it was smallest sum)., From randomization to either disease progression or death whichever occurs first (up to 29 months)
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Up to 5 years 3 months|Duration of Response (DoR), Up to 5 years 3 months|Overall Survival (OS), Up to 5 years 3 months|Time to Subsequent Therapy (TST), Up to 5 years 3 months|Progression-Free Survival After First Subsequent Therapy (PFS2), Up to 5 years 3 months|Time to Symptomatic Progression (TTSP), Up to 5 years 3 months|Number of Participants Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), From Day 1 to 5 years 2 months|Number of Participants TEAEs With Severity, From Day 1 to 5 years 2 months|Number of Participants With Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities, Up to 5 years 3 months|Number of Participants With Vital Signs Abnormalities, Up to 5 years 3 months|Number of Participants With Physical Examination Abnormalities, Up to 5 years 3 months|Serum Concentration of Amivantamab, Day 1 (Cycles 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13), Day 2 (Cycle 1)|Number of Participants With Anti-Amivantamab Antibodies, Day 1 (Cycles 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13), Day 2 (Cycle 1)|Change From Baseline in European Organization of Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC-QLQ-C30), From baseline to 5 years 3 months|Change From Baseline in Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System-Physical Function (PROMIS-PF), From baseline to 5 years 3 months
