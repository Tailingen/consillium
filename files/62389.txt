This is an open-label, fixed sequence, 2-part (Part A and Part B), drug-drug interaction study in healthy post-menopausal female participants. Participants enrolled in Part A may subsequently also participate in Part B.

Part A of the study will assess the effect of repeated oral doses of camizestrant on the PK of a single oral dose of midazolam. It will comprise:

* A Screening Period of maximum 28 days.
* Three Treatment Periods during which participants will be resident at the Clinical Unit from the day before study intervention administration (Day -1) until after the last camizestrant PK sample on Day 8.

  1. Period 1: participants will receive a single oral dose of midazolam (Day 1).
  2. Period 2: participants will receive an oral once daily (OD) dose of camizestrant (Day 2 to Day 6).
  3. Period 3: participants will receive a single oral dose of midazolam and camizestrant (Day 7).
* A Follow-up Visit, for which the participant will return to the Clinical Unit 7 (± 2) days after the last camizestrant PK sample in Period 3.

Part B of the study will assess the effect of multiple oral doses of carbamazepine on the PK of a single oral dose of camizestrant. It will comprise:

* A Screening Period of maximum 28 days.
* Two Treatment Periods during which participants will be resident at the Clinical Unit from the day before study intervention administration (Day -1) until after the last camizestrant PK sample on Day 16.

  1. Period 1: participants will receive a single oral dose of camizestrant (Day 1) with PK sampling on Day 1 to Day 4.
  2. Period 2: participants will receive low oral doses (Dose 1) of carbamazepine twice a day (BID) on Day 4 to Day 6, mid oral doses (Dose 2) of carbamazepine BID on Day 7 to Day 9, and high oral doses (Dose 3) of carbamazepine BID on Day 10 to Day 15. On Day 13, participants will receive a single oral dose of camizestrant.
* A Follow-up Visit, for which the participant will return to the Clinical Unit 7 (± 2) days after the last camizestrant PK sample in Period 2.
