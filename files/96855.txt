SCOOT: Sample Collection for DART
The study will use a blood sample collected from participants to:

* Develop new ways of finding and diagnosing lung health problems, such as lung cancer.
* Develop tools which make it easier to screen people with possible lung health problems, diagnose problems earlier and with fewer tests, and start the best treatment faster.
* Help improve the early diagnosis of lung cancer, as finding lung cancer early means that it can be treated more easily and successfully.
Lung Cancer
To develop an algorithm that gives a greater than chance improved ability to diagnose lung cancer using the blood biomarkers with or without the AI CT algorithm compared to not using them, by February 2025
To develop an algorithm that gives a greater than chance improved ability to diagnose lung cancer using the blood biomarkers with or without the AI CT and blood markers algorithm compared to not using them, by February 2025
The results from this study will be linked with the data from the DART study (also collecting data through the Lung Health Check programme) to develop new ways of using computer technology (artificial intelligence) to improve lung health care. The studies use computer programs (called 'algorithms') which can be trained to analyse medical samples. Once developed, these algorithms can be used to support doctors by increasing their speed and accuracy of diagnosing issues.
