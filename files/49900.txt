Addition of Cord Blood Tissue-Derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells to Ruxolitinib for the Treatment of Steroid-Refractory Acute Graft Versus Host Disease
This early phase I trial is to find out the effect of adding cord blood tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (cb-MSCs) to ruxolitinib in treating patients with acute graft versus host disease that does not respond to steroid therapy (steroid-refractory). Ruxolitinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. cb-MSCs are a type of tissue helper cell that can be removed from donated umbilical cord blood tissue and grown into many different cell types that can be used to treat cancer and other disease, such as graft versus host disease. This trial aims to learn if adding cb-MSCs to ruxolitinib may help control steroid-refractory acute graft versus host disease.

Death from any cause, Within 28 days from the start of active study treatment|Response, Will compare the patient's 28-day graft versus host disease (GVHD) status to the patient's baseline GVHD status when steroid refractory acute GVHD was diagnosed., At day 28 from start of therapy on study|Incidence of adverse events, Within 28 days from the start of active study treatment
Graft versus host disease status, Will assess complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), and progressive disease (PD)., At days 7, 14, 21 and 28 post treatment|Proportion of response, Will assess proportion of patients with CR, PR, VGPR, and no-response (NR). The event NR is defined as stable disease, mixed response, disease progression, OR initiation of additional systemic (second-line) GVHD therapies., At days 7, 14, 21 and 28 post treatment|Time to complete response, Will be estimated by the method of Kaplan and Meier., Up to 6 months|Time to very good partial response, Will be estimated by the method of Kaplan and Meier., Up to 6 months|Time to partial response, Will be estimated by the method of Kaplan and Meier., Up to 6 months|Incidence of complete response for each organ, Up to 6 months|Incidence of very good partial response for each organ, Up to 6 months|Incidence of partial response for each organ, Up to 6 months|Durability of organ response, Up to 6 months|Cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality (NRM), At 6 months post treatment|Cumulative incidence of relapse/progression of the primary disease, At 6 months|Overall survival, From enrollment to death from any cause, assessed at 6 months|Disease-free survival, From enrollment to death from any cause or relapse/progression of the primary disease, assessed at 6 months|Graft versus host disease-free survival, Patients alive, free of active acute or chronic GVHD, and without other systemic agents (or escalation of steroids to \>= 2.5 mg/kg/day of prednisone \[or methylprednisolone equivalent of 2 mg/kg/day\]) added for treatment of GVHD will be considered successes for this endpoint, At 6 months|Incidence of chronic graft versus host disease, Chronic GVHD is defined per National Institutes of Health Consensus Criteria. Diagnosis of chronic GVHD of any severity (mild, moderate, or severe) is considered an event for this endpoint. Organ involvement and maximum severity will also be described at six months., At 6 months after first mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) infusion|Incidence of systemic infections, The incidence of grade 2 to 3 systemic infections occurring from study treatment until 28 days after last study drug will be described using standard Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) criteria. Infections will be recorded by site of disease, date of onset, and severity., 28 days after last study drug|Incidence of toxicities, The incidence of grade 3-5 treatment-emergent adverse events (per CTCAE version 5.0) that occur through 28 days after completing last MSC infusion study drug will be described., Up to 28 days after completing last MSC infusion study drug|Incidence of any grade cytokine release, Up to 28 days after completing last MSC infusion study drug|Incidence of any infusional toxicity, Within 24 hours of each cord blood-MSC infusion
Cytokine biomarker analysis (optional), Will use cytokine biomarker assays to predict response to therapy., Up to 6 months|Fecal samples analysis (optional), Will use fecal samples to assess microbiome and potential predictor for response to therapy., Up to 6 months
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To estimate between-arm differences (Arm 3 versus \[vs\] Arm 1, and Arm 2 vs Arm 1) for each of the 28-day co-primary outcome probabilities.

OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.

ARM 1: Patients receive ruxolitinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for at least 3 days and may consider tapering after 6 months of therapy if response occurs and therapeutic corticosteroid doses have been discontinued.

ARM 2: Patients receive ruxolitinib PO BID as in Arm 1. Patients also receive lower dose of cb-MSCs intravenously (IV) for up to 60 minutes twice weekly (at least 3 days apart) over 4 consecutive weeks for 8 total doses.

ARM 3: Patients receive ruxolitinib PO BID as in Arm 1. Patients also receive higher dose of cb-MSCs IV for up to 60 minutes twice weekly (at least 3 days apart) over 4 consecutive weeks for 8 total doses.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up on day 28 and then for up to 6 months.
