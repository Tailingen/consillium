Cologne Esophageal Response Prediction Study (CERP-Study)
RATIONALE: The prognosis of patients with advanced esophageal cancer may be improved by preoperative chemoradiation. But only those patients have a benefit from this additional therapy, whose tumor shows a response after chemoradiation. Molecular markers may help to identify before starting the therapy those patients who response.

PURPOSE: This is the first prospective, clinical trial to study the impact of ERCC1 to predict histopathological response to neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy (RTx/CTx) in patients with cancer of the esophagus.
Esophageal Cancer
GENETIC: ERCC1 pathways analysis
histopathologic response to chemoradiation, Patients with cT3 esophageal cancer received RTx/CTx according a standardized protocol. 6 weeks after this neoadjuvant therapy a tranthoracic esophagectomy with two-field lymphadenectomy will be performed.

The histopathologic response is measured using the surgical specimen., 1 month postoperative
prognosis, All patients get a standardized follow-up every three month evaluating clinical signs of response. If necessary additional diagnostic procedures will be performed., 2 years after surgical resection
