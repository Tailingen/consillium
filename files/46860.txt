This study is a phase IV, open-label, clinical trial to determine the efficacy of niraparib maintenance therapy in BRCA1/2 wild-type, advanced-stage, low-risk, primary ovarian cancer patients. The study will assess the effectiveness of progression-free survival (12 months PFS rate) as determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. The subject will be treated up to three years or until disease progression as below:

Niraparib 200mg or 300mg (once daily \[QD\])\*

\*The recommended starting dosage of niraparib is 200mg QD. For patients who weigh ≥77 kg and have baseline platelet count ≥150,000/μL, the recommended starting dosage is 300 mg QD.
