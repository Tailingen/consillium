Reducing Dose and Irradiated Volume in Cervical Prophylactic Irradiation for Nasopharyngeal Cancer
The purpose of this study is to investigate whether reducing both the dose and the irradiated volume of cervical prophylactic irradiation in patients with nasopharyngeal cancer can maintain efficacy while decreasing toxicity. This will be achieved through a comparison of standard cervical prophylactic irradiation with a reduced-dose and reduced-volume approach.
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
RADIATION: IMRT with reduced-dose and reduced-volume cervical prophylactic irradiation
Regional failure-free survival, The regional relapse-free survival rate will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier method for each arm from the date of randomization to the date of nodal relapse or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. Their differences will be compared between treatment arms using the log-rank test., 3 years
Overall Survival, time from the date of the start of chemotherapy to death due to any cause, 3 years|Local failure-free survival (LFFS), The duration of time to LFFS was calculated from the date of histological diagnosis until documented treatment local failure or death from any cause., 3 years|Distant metastasis-free survival, The distant metastasis-free survival rate will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier, 3 years|Number of participants with adverse events, 3 years|Incidence of acute and late toxicity, 3 years
Patients with non-metastatic nasopharyngeal cancer who are candidates for receiving definitive IMRT are randomly assigned to receive either standard cervical prophylactic irradiation or a reduced-dose and reduced-volume approach. The standard arm receives the conventional dose and volume of irradiation, while the experimental arm receives a lower dose and a smaller irradiated volume. Both groups will undergo intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) to the primary tumor and involved lymph nodes. The primary endpoint of this study is regional-control (RC), and secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS), local control (LC), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and toxicity. All efficacy analyses will be conducted in the intention-to-treat population, and the safety population will include only patients who receive their randomly assigned treatment.
