Randomized Phase III Study of TS-1 Alone Versus TS-1 Plus CDDP in Advanced Gastric Cancer
This study aimed to verify the survival benefit of TS-1 plus CDDP combination chemotherapy compared with the monotherapy by TS-1 alone.
Gastric Cancer
DRUG: TS-1 and cisplatin|DRUG: TS-1
Overall survival, every course for first three courses, then every other course
Overall response rate, lesion-directed response rate, time to treatment failure (TTF), hospitalization-free survival period within the periods of TTF, and safety profile, every course for first three courses, then every other course
This is a randomized, controlled, open-label, parallel, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to 3 factors ; performance status (ECOG scale: 0, 1, 2), disease stage (unresectable gastric cancer or recurrent gastric cancer (received prior adjuvant chemotherapy or not)) and participating center. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm A: Patients receive oral TS-1 twice daily on days 1-28 followed by 14 days rest. Treatment is repeated every 42 days for up to 4 courses. Arm B: Patients receive CDDP iv on day 8 and oral TS-1 twice daily on days 1-21 followed by 14 days rest. Treatment is repeated every 35 days for up to 5 courses. Patients are followed every 6 months for up to 2 years from the day they participates in this study.
