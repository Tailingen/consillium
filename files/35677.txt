One Trial of JCXH-211 Intratumoral Injection Combined With Anti-PD-1 Antibody in Patients With Malignant Solid Tumors
This is an open-label, dose-escalation and dose-expansion Phase I clinical study divided into Phase Ia and Phase Ib to evaluate the safety and tolerability of JCXH-211 combined with anti-PD-1 antibody in patients with malignant solid tumors.
Malignant Solid Tumors
DRUG: JCXH-211 Intratumoral Injection Combined with Anti-PD-1 Antibody IV infusion
Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), The DLT observation period is 28 days after first dose of JCXH-211 combined with anti-PD-1 antibody
Phase Ia: Dose escalation study of intratumoral injection of JCXH-211 combined with anti-PD-1 antibody IV infusion A dose escalation study of intratumoral injection of JCXH-211 combined with anti-PD-1 antibody IV infusion will be planned in 2 dose groups . Three to six patients will be enrolled in each dose group.

Phase Ib:Dose Expansion Study of JCXH-211 Combined with Anti-PD-1 Antibody In this part of the study, the sponsor and investigator select the optimal dose based on the safety, PK, PD and preliminary efficacy results of the dose escalation phase, and select 1 to 2 of the tumors for JCXH-211 combined with anti-PD-1 antibody dose expansion study with reference to the approved indications of anti-PD-1 antibody (Toripalimab ) in China, and planned to enroll 15 to 30 patients in each cohort of combination therapy.

Tumor response assessments will be performed using RECIST1.1 and iRECIST at the end of study treatment/early withdrawal visit and every 6 weeks during treatment.

All patients will be followed for safety and survival. The data cut-off date for study is defined as 6 months after the last patient is enrolled.
