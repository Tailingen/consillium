Double Cord Blood Transplant for Patients With Malignant and Non-malignant Disorders
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and toxicity and feasibility of double umbilical cord blood transplantation (DUCBT) in patients with selected malignant and non-malignant, and to quantify the percentage and donor sources of mixed donor chimerism following DUCBT in patients with selected malignant and non-malignant disorders.

Allogeneic stem cell transplantation from an human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched related family donor is the treatment of choice for a wide variety of malignant and non-malignant disorders. Unfortunately, only 25% of potential recipients have an HLA matched related family donor, leaving approximately 75% of potential recipients requiring alternative sources of HLA matched allogeneic stem cells. One potential source of HLA matched allogeneic stem cells is from unrelated adult donors that have been identified in the national and international donor registries. However, several limitations restrict the uniform utilization of unrelated allogeneic adult donors including ethnic background of the recipient, acuity and timing of planned allogeneic transplant, availability of donor, and high risk of severe acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (III/IV), among others. The investigators have recently identified a new alternative source of allogeneic stem cells, unrelated cryopreserved placental/cord blood stem cells.
