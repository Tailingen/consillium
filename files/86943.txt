Preoperative IMRT With Concurrent High-dose Vitamin C and mFOLFOX6 in Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of preoperative chemoradiotherapy (IMRT) with concurrent high-dose intravenous vitamin C and mFOLFOX6 in locally advanced rectal cancer patients.
Rectal Cancer
DRUG: Vitamin C
PCR rate, The PCR rate is defined as the percentage of subjects who achieved Pathological complete remission（PCR） in the total number of the subjects who underwent surgery in the ITT population., 2 year From the first subject underwent surgery to the last subject underwent surgery.
acute toxicity, acute toxicity including diarrhea， vomiting leukopenia, er al, during the preoperative CRT and high-dose intravenous vitamin C and 30 after the radiotherapy., 2 year|Resection rate of anus preserving surgery, In patients with low rectal cancer, the percentage of subjects who underwent anus preserving surgery accounted for the total TME surgery., 2 year From the first subject underwent surgery to the last subject underwent surgery.|2-year survival rate, 2-year survival rate of ITT (Intent to treat) population., up to 2 years after the last subject being enrolled|2-year disease-free survival rate, 2-year disease-free survival rate of ITT population., up to 2 years after the last subject being enrolled.
Sixty patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (cT3-4N0M0, cT1-4N1-2M0, ≤12cm from anus) will be enrolled and receive preoperative IMRT concurrent with high-dose intravenous vitamin C and 2-3 cycles of mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy, and then after 4 weeks rest, they will continue to complete 3 cycles of preoperative chemotherapy (mFOLFOX6). Radical surgery will be performed at 10-12 weeks after IMRT.

In this study, we will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the treatment method through the acute toxicity \[during CRT (concurrent chemoradiotherapy )\], PCR (pathologic complete response) rate, sphincter preserving surgery rate, 2-year survival rate and 2-year disease-free survival rate.
