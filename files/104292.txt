Malnutrition is a major public health issue in low- and middle-income countries and forms part of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals .Cancer is a systemic disease, since even in the early stages malignancies are accompanied by homeostatic imbalance, including metabolic deregulation and increased catabolism. These abnormalities may initially seem poorly discernible in the clinic, but with disease progression they may aggravate; and may cause overt cancer-related cachexia.GI cancers show higher mortality than any other kind of cancer. In 2020, they accounted for an estimated 3.5 million deaths worldwide, with a further 5.0 million new cases diagnosed in the same year . Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the most common type of GI cancer, being the third most common of all organ cancers after lung and breast cancers, whereas gastric, liver, esophageal, and pancreatic cancers are ranked the fifth, sixth, eighth, and 12th most commonly diagnosed cancers, respectively
