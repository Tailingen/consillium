The primary endpoint requires follow-up through 30 months, but all subjects will be followed for 72 months regardless of initiation of other local or systemic prostate cancer treatments, which will allow assessments of recurrence rates and morbidity after conversion to radical therapy, long-term safety and tolerability, as well as oncologic outcomes.

This is multi-center, prospective, randomized controlled phase III clinical trial that will compare two treatment methods (PGA with TOOKAD® VTP and Active Surveillance) for treating localized prostate cancer who meet the inclusion criteria will be approached for participation in the clinical study. Patients consenting to participate will be individually randomized to TOOKAD® VTP or Active Surveillance with a 1:1 ratio. Central randomization will be performed using an independent web-based allocation system. Randomization will be stratified by center using minimization. Ongoing assessment of patients in both arms will be balanced, including follow up examinations, PSA testing, MRI and biopsies at defined intervals.

Subjects in the experimental arm will receive the experimental treatment consisting of unilateral TOOKAD® VTP treatment applied to the index lobe containing pattern 4 cancer. The treatment will be administered under general anesthesia. Routine ultrasound examination in the operating room will be performed for morphometric description of the prostate and to facilitate accurate treatment planning and probe placement. Ultrasound will not be used for diagnostic purposes.
