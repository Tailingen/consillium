Evaluation of PD-L1 (Programmed Death-Ligand 1) Tumor Expression in Patients With Large-cell Neuroendocrine Carcinoma (NEC)
Observational, multicentre, retrospective study on patients taken care according to the national guidelines. The objective is to define, after the diagnosis confirmation, the frequency of PD-L1 expression in patients with large-cell lung neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC), whatever the stage of the disease, and to correlate this parameter to clinical data at the time of diagnosis, therapeutic response and survival. Large-cell NECs present a bad prognostic and there is no evidence of treatment for these patients with advanced disease in second ligne of treatment at that time. To demonstrate the PD-L1 expression in this type of cancer might have a major therapeutic impact in a close future to access immunotherapies.

OTHER: Immunohistochemistry
Frequency of PD-L1 expression in patients with large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC), Determine the frequency of PD-L1 expression in patients with large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC)in terms of percentage of tumor cells expressing PD-L1 in immunohistochemistry (IHC) at the time of diagnosis:

The frequency of PD-L1 expression determined by IHC will be as follow:

* Negative PD-L1 tumours (\<1% of positive tumour cells)
* Positive PD-L1 tumours (\> or = to 1% of positive tumour cells)
* Low positive PD-L1 tumours (from 1% to 49% of positive tumour cells expressed)
* High positive PD-L1 tumours (\> or = 50% of positive tumour cells expressed), Retrospective central evaluation on tumour materials (slides) collected on patients diagnosed with NEC between 01 January 2014 and 31 December 2016
Correlation of PD-L1 expression of tumour cells with clinical data, Describe the disease at the time of diagnosis using TNM IASLC/UICC 2009 classification, Retrospective-data collected on patients diagnosed with NEC between 01 January 2014 and 31 December 2016|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective Response Rate (ORR): best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) to a first line of treatment using RECIST 1.1 criteria as assessed locally, Retrospective-data collected on patients diagnosed with NEC between 01 January 2014 and 31 December 2016|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS of the first line of treatment using RECIST 1.1 criteria assessed locally defined as the time from first treatment start to disease progression or death for any cause expressed in months, Retrospective-data collected on patients diagnosed with NEC between 01 January 2014 and 31 December 2016|Overall survival (OS), OS defined as the time from first treatment start to death for any cause expressed in months, Retrospective-data collected on patients diagnosed with NEC between 01 January 2014 and 31 December 2016
