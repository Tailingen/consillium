Study to Determine the Safety and Efficacy of Ribociclib in Combination With Hormone Therapy and Hypofractionated Radiotherapy in Breast Cancer, With Positive Hormone Receptors and Negative HER2 Status, in Newly Diagnosed, Not Immediately Operable Elderly Patient (CALHYS)
Women aged 70 years or older, newly diagnosed for locally advanced unilateral breast cancer, with a histological diagnosis of invasive mammary carcinoma, positive hormone receptors, HER2 status Negative, not immediately operable (stage of disease, comorbidities or refusal of surgery) with tumor in place, with indication of treatment with hormone therapy and hypofractionated radiotherapy, not eligible for neoadjuvant chemotherapy and without major comorbidity contraindicating the proposed treatment regimen.
HER2 Negative Breast Cancer Not Immediately Operated
DRUG: Ribociclib Oral Tablet
Phase I : determination of Maximal Tolerated Dose (MTD) and the Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) of Ribociclib, Phase I : the frequencies of adverse events according to the CTCAE 4.03 requiring a dose discontinuation (DLT) will be determined during the 8 weeks of radiotherapy concomitant with the Ribociclib and hormone therapy and during the 3 months of post-radiotherapy follow-up., Phase I : during the 8 weeks of radiotherapy concomitant with the Ribociclib and hormone therapy and during the 3 months of post-radiotherapy follow-up.|Phase II : evaluation of the efficacy of Ribociclib in association with hormone therapy and hypofractionated radiotherapy, Phase II :The primary endpoint will be the rate of non-progression at 24-months, defined as the percentage of patients who are alive and have not progressed 24 months after the completion of the Ribociclib and Radiotherapy concomitant phase., Phase II : at 24-months
