A Study to Investigate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Preliminary Efficacy of SIM0237 Alone or in Combination with BCG in NMIBC
This is an open-label, multicenter phase 1 study to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics (PK) characteristics of SIM0237 alone or in combination with bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) in participants with Non-Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC)
Non-Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC)
DRUG: SIM0237|DRUG: SIM0237 and BCG|DRUG: SIM0237|DRUG: SIM0237 and BCG
Dose escalation:Dose limited toxicity (DLT), DLT observation period (up to 21 days)|Dose escalation: Percentage of participants experiencing treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events(SAEs),and lab abnormalities, through study completion, an average of 5 years|Dose expansion:Complete response (CR) rate at Month 3, Complete response (CR) rate at of Cohort 1 and Cohort 3, through study completion, an average of 5 years|Dose escalation: Percentage of participants experiencing AE related dose interruptions and dose delays, dose intensity, Occurrence of AE related dose interruptions, dose delays and dose intensity, through study completion, an average of 5 years
The study starts with a dose escalation part followed by a dose expansion part. The primary objective of the dose escalation part is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SIM0237 alone or in combination with BCG, and determine the recommended dose(s) (RD). The primary objective of the dose expansion part is to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of SIM0237 alone or in combination with BCG.
