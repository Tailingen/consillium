Phase I Study of SHR-A2102 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
The study was designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of SHR2102 in patients with advanced solid tumors. The objective of this study was to determine the dose-limiting toxicity, maximum tolerance and recommended dose of SHR-A2102 in phase II study.
