Factors Affecting the Results of Treatment of Patients With Colorectal Cancer
The study attempts to quantify the relative risks for mortality, anastomotic leakage and other early and late postoperative complications, recurrence rate, cancer-specific survival, recurrence-free survival after colorectal surgery for patients with colorectal cancer depending on the localization of the tumor.
Colorectal Cancer|Colon Cancer|Rectal Cancer|Colorectal Adenocarcinoma|Colorectal Neoplasms Malignant|Rectal Adenocarcinoma
PROCEDURE: Right hemicolectomy|PROCEDURE: Left hemicolectomy|PROCEDURE: Sigmoid colon resection|PROCEDURE: Anterior resection of the rectum|PROCEDURE: Low anterior resection of the rectum|PROCEDURE: Abdominoperineal resection|PROCEDURE: Total Colectomy
Anastomotic leakage rate, Anastomotic leakage rate after colorectal resection.

AL is confirmed by one or more of the following conditions:

* fecal discharge from the pelvic drainage at any time after surgery
* rectovaginal fistula defined as fecal or mucus discharge from the vagina
* pelvic sepsis as defined by the collection of pus/ fecal material in the pelvis documented by CT scan
* contrast present outside of the anastomosis as seen by X-Ray contrast enema proctography or CT contrast enema proctography, 3 months after surgery|Mortality rate, the overall mortality after colorectal cancer surgery, 3 years after surgery
30-day complication rate, The number of patients with complications after colorectal resection. All complications will be assessed according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. It consists of 7 grades (I, II, IIIa, IIIb, IVa, IVb and V).

Grade I - Any deviation from the normal postoperative course without the need for treatment.

Grade II - Requiring pharmacological treatment with drugs other than such allowed for grade I complications.

Grade III - Requiring surgical, endoscopic or radiological intervention

* IIIa - Intervention not under general anesthesia
* IIIb - Intervention under general anesthesia Grade IV - Life-threatening complication requiring IC/ICU-management
* IVa - single organ dysfunction (including dialysis)
* IVb - multiorgandysfunction Grade V - Death of a patient, 30 days after surgery|Recurrence rate, All cases of colorectal cancer recurrence, 3 years after surgery|Cancer-specific survival, The number of patients survived within 3 years after the diagnosis, 3 years after surgery|Recurrence-free survival, The number of patients without cancer recurrence within 3 years after surgery, 3 years after surgery
The study attempts to quantify the relative risks for mortality, anastomotic leakage and other early and late postoperative complications, recurrence rate, cancer-specific survival, recurrence-free survival after colorectal surgery for patients with colorectal cancer depending on the localization of the tumor.
