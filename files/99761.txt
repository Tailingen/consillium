Association Between Mitochondrial DNA Content and Risk of Acute Leukemia
Compelling epidemiological evidence indicates that alterations of mitochondrial DNA, including mutations and abnormal content of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), are associated with the initiation and development of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).The aim of this study was to explore association between mtDNA content in peripheral blood cells could be used as a risk predictor for ALL.
Lymphoblastic Leukemia in Children
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Relative copy number of mitochondrial DNA
Relative copy number of mitochondrial DNA, The ratio of mitochondrial DNA contents to hemoglobin contents was calculated for each sample from standard curves. After that, the ratio for each sample was normalized to a calibrator DNA in order to standardize between different runs, and then defined as the measurement of relative mtDNA contents.Relative expression of mtDNA were measured in young adults suffered from chronic lymphocytic leukemiawhen compared with control group., From date of admission until the date of discharging from hospital, assessed up to 5 days
