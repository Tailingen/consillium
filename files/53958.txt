Neoadjuvant Dasatinib and Radical Cystectomy for Transitional Cell Carcinoma of the Bladder
This pilot study is designed to determine feasibility and safety of treatment with dasatinib administered orally once daily for 4 weeks duration prior to radical cystectomy for urothelial carcinoma of the bladder.
Transitional Cell Carcinoma of the Bladder
DRUG: Dasatinib|PROCEDURE: Radical Cystectomy
Feasibility, Feasibility for this trial is defined as at least 60% (\>=14 of 23) of patients completing study therapy in the absence of Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), From enrollment to completion of radical cystectomy
Grade 3/4 Toxicities, Report grade 3/4 toxicities during treatment with dasatinib prior to radical cystectomy in patients with muscle invasive transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder., Time of consent through 30 days after treatment discontinuation|Reduced pSFK Expression, pSFK levels were analyzed pre and post treatment, Baseline to post dasatinib therapy|Pathologic Complete Response (pCR) Rate, Pathologic complete response (pCR) rate is defined as no residual evidence of muscle-invasive disease at cystectomy (\< pT0)., 24 months|Post-Cystectomy Pathologic Stage, Tumor Node Metastasis (TNM) Staging. This system classifies tumors by size and extent of the primary tumor (T), involvement of regional lymph nodes (N), and the presence or absence of distant metastases (M) T0=No evidence of primary tumor, Tis=Carcinoma in situ, and T1, T2, T3, T4=Increasing size and/or local extension of the primary tumor, TX=Not assessed N0=No Regional lymph node metastases, N1, N2, N3=Increasing number or extent of regional lymph node involvement, NX=not assessed M0=No distant metastases, M1=Distant metastases present, Staged Post-Cystectomy and dasatinib treatment|Reduced Ki-67 Expression, Ki-67 levels were analyzed pre and post treatment, Baseline to post dasatinib therapy|Increase in Cas3 Expression, Cas3 levels were analyzed pre and post treatment, Baseline to post dasatinib therapy
OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

This is a pilot study designed to determine the safety and feasibility of treatment with dasatinib 100 mg administered orally once daily for 4 weeks duration prior to radical cystectomy for patients with muscle-invasive transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder ineligible for and/or willing to forgo neoadjuvant cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy. If surgery delay is imperative, dasatinib therapy should continue until at least 24 hours before planned surgery.
