Cancer Associated Thrombosis : What is the Proportion of Patients Ineligible to a Study as CARAVAGGIO
Venous thromboembolism is a common and fatal disease closely related to cancer. The therapeutic challenge is major due to the high risk of recurrent thromboembolism and bleeding in patients with cancer.

Guidelines recommend the use of low molecular-weight heparin for the treatment of Cancer-Associated venous Thromboembolism (CAT) at least for 3 to 6 months of treatment.

However, recent advances through the results of several therapeutic trials such as CARAVAGGIO (NCT03045406) open the door to the use of Direct Oral AntiCoagulants (DOACs) as first-line therapy.

Nevertheless, extrapolation of its results may be limited owing to a large number of inclusion and exclusion criteria, which may have selected a reduced population.

The proportion of patients admitted with acute CAT who may not eligible to a trial as CARAVAGGIO is unknown.

OTHER: data collection
Proportion of cancer patients with a venous thromboembolic event (VTE) ineligible for CARAVAGGIO study, Patient having at least one of the following exclusion criteria (from CARAVAGGIO study) :

* ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ) Performance Status III or IV;
* life expectancy of less than 6 months;
* thrombectomy, vena cava filter insertion, or thrombolysis used to manage the index episode;
* indication for anticoagulant treatment for a disease other than the index VTE episode;
* thienopyridine therapy (clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor) or aspirin over 165 mg daily or dual antiplatelet therapy;
* recent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery
* hemoglobin level lower than 8 g/dL or platelet count \<75x10\^9/L or history of heparin induced thrombocytopenia;
* creatinine clearance \< 30 ml /min
* acute hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis, liver cirrhosis;
* uncontrolled hypertension;
* concomitant use of strong inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome;
* bacterial endocarditis;, Up to 6 months after venous thromboembolic event
Drugs used for their VTE, Collected in medical history., Up to 6 months after venous thromboembolic event|Confirmed recurrent Venous Thromboembolic Event (VTE), Collected in medical history.

* Pulmonary embolism
* deep venous thrombosis, Up to 6 months after venous thromboembolic event|Bleeding event, Collected in medical history., Up to 6 months after venous thromboembolic event|Death, Collected in medical history., Up to 6 months after venous thromboembolic event
The aim of this study si to assess this proportion in a retrospective multicenter study, of patients admitted for acute Cancer-Associated venous Thromboembolism (CAT).
