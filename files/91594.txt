This is a Study to Evaluate the Safety and Tolerability of the Study Drug ABL001, and to Determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose and/or Recommended Phase 2 Study Dose of ABL001
The purpose of this open-label, dose escalation-dose expansion, Phase 1 clinical trial is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor activity and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of NOV1501 (ABL001).
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: NOV1501 (ABL001)
Number and percentage of subjects with adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), The maximum tolerated dose/maximum administered dose will be determined by the number of participant experiencing DLTs. The safety profile will be assessed through number of participants experiencing AEs, SAEs, abnormal laboratory parameters, vital signs and electrocardiogram (ECG) results., From time of 1st administration of ABL001 until day 21.
This is an open-label, Phase 1 dose escalation and expansion study of NOV1501 (ABL001) to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and the anti-tumor efficacy of ABL001 in patients with advanced solid tumors after failure of standard of care.

Patients will be enrolled in two stages: a dose-escalation stage and an expansion phase. DLTs will be assessed as the primary endpoint in this trial.
