A Phase Ib Study of HS-10352 Plus Fulvestrant in Patients With Advanced Breast Cancer
HS-10352 is a highly potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (p110α). The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and efficacy of HS-10352 plus fulvestrant in patients with hormone receptor (HR) positive, human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2)-negative, advanced breast cancer (ABC) harboring PIK3CA mutations.

This is a Phase Ib open-label, 2-Part, multi-center study in China. The study will be conducted in two stages: Stage 1 is the dose-escalation part, which is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK and efficacy, as well as to determine the maximum tolerable dosage (MTD) or maximum applicable dose (MAD) of HS-10352 in combination with fulvestrant. Stage 2 is the dose-expansion part, which is aimed to further assess the efficacy, safety, tolerability and PK, and to establish the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of HS-10352 in combination with fulvestrant.

All participants will be carefully monitored for adverse events (AE) during the study treatment and for 28 days after the last dose of study drug. The PK characteristics of HS-10352 and fulvestrant will be evaluated from C1 to C6. Subjects of this study will be assessed for progression once every 8 weeks until objective disease progression or withdrawal from the trial. As the disease progresses, survival follow-up is recommended bimonthly.
