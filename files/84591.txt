Health-related quality of life - EORTC QLQ-C30, Assessed using the EORTC Core Quality of Life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), which is designed to measure cancer patients' physical, psychological and social functions.

Scores among partial cystectomy patients will be compared to radical cystectomy patients., Up to 1 year|Self-reported urinary outcomes, Assessed using the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire - Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (EORTC QLQ-BLM30), a 30-item questionnaire related to general symptoms experienced during the past week or during the past 4 weeks.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Explore and compare urinary outcomes in postoperative partial cystectomy patients and matched radical cystectomy patients through patient-filled questionnaires.

II. Explore and compare health related quality of life in postoperative partial cystectomy and matched radical cystectomy patients using patient-filled questionnaires.

III. Explore the relationship of patient-specific characteristics, ranging from demographic characteristics and clinicopathologic characteristics, on variation in HRQOL and urinary outcomes among the partial cystectomy and radical cystectomy cohorts.

OUTLINE: This is an observational study.

Patients complete questionnaires and have their medical records reviewed on study.
