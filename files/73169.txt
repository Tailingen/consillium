Biological Insights of First Relapsed-refractory Patients With Mantle Cell Lymphoma: the MANTLE-FIRST BIO Study.
Retrospective observational study with a prospective biological evaluation of an historical cohort of first relapsed-refractory patients with mantle cell lymphoma who were relapsed or refractory to rituximab and chemotherapy containing induction regimens with curative intent.
Mantle Cell Lymphoma
Histopathological characterization of patients with Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL), Histopathological characterization of patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who were relapsed or refractory to rituximab and chemotherapy containing induction regimens with curative intent. 80 Mantel Cell Lymphoma (MCL) patients stratified according to Chemo-immunotherapy (CIT) or Bruton Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKi) resistance (20 for each of the groups previously identified) will undergo central pathology revision with assessment of Immunoglobulin (Ig) expression and other histopathological studies., The endpoint will be evaluated from the beginning to the end of the study (up to 36 months)
Mutational analysis of Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) driver genes, Performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections as well as, when available, on frozen material or viable cryopreserved cells at Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) diagnosis. The aim is to perform a mutational analysis for Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) driver genes: Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) on approximately 80 cases of Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL), including 20 cases Relapsed/Refractory (R/R) to Bruton Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKi), The endpoint will be evaluated from the beginning to the end of the study (up to 36 months)|Functional study of the B-Cell Receptor (BCR) activity by flow cytometry in Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) cell samples, Performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections as well as, when available, on frozen material or viable cryopreserved cells at Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) diagnosis. The aim is to perform a functional study of the B-Cell Receptor (BCR) activity: multiplexed phospho-specific flow cytometry on 10-20 Relapsed/Refractory (R/R) Mantle Cell Lymphoma cases., The endpoint will be evaluated from the beginning to the end of the study (up to 36 months)|To understand the mechanisms of evasion from B-Cell Receptor (BCR) requirement, with particular focus on Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) cases that are resistant to Chemo-immunotherapy (CIT) and/or Bruton Tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibition, Performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections as well as, when available, on frozen material or viable cryopreserved cells at Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) diagnosis. The aim is to understand the mechanisms of evasion from B-Cell Receptor (BCR) requirement as follow:

* Immunoglobulin (IgH/IgL V(D)J) profiling by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) on 80 mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cases;
* Chromatin accessibility studies (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin sequencing, ATAC-seq) on approximately 20 cases among the Immunoglobulin (Ig)-negative identified cases or Bruton Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKi) refractory cases, irrespective of their B-Cell Receptor (BCR) status, and on other 20 cases, from the group of patients sensitive to Bruton Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKi);
* Gene Expression Profiling (GEP) by RNA-seq, on about 20 cases selected on the basis of results of the Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin sequencing (ATAC-Seq) analysis;, The endpoint will be evaluated from the beginning to the end of the study (up to 36 months)|Unveil the role of the MALT1-MYC (Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1 - MYC) pathway in Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) cases expressing or not the BCR (B-Cell Receptor), Performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections as well as, when available, on frozen material or viable cryopreserved cells at Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) diagnosis. The aim is to perform RNA studies on 20 cases, The endpoint will be evaluated from the beginning to the end of the study (up to 36 months)|To correlate results of biologic studies with clinical characteristics of patients, About 80 cases of Relapsed/Refractory (R/R) Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) with available tissue samples will be considered for correlation between biological studies with clinical characteristics of patients, response to treatment and conventional outcomes (Progression Free Survival, Progression Free Survival at 2 years, Overall Survival, Overall Survival at 2 years), The endpoint will be evaluated from the beginning to the end of the study (up to 36 months)
Biological samples from 80 Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) patients will be collected and analyzed in 30 Italian sites in 36 months.

Patients will be identified and selected both on a clinical base and according to the availability of Formaline-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) material, frozen material or viable cryopreserved cells at Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) diagnosis. They will be analyzed in 4 subgroups, each with different clinical specificity: 1) refractory to Induction Chemoimmunotherapy (CIT); 2) refractory to Bruton Tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors (BTKi); 3) sensitive to induction Induction Chemoimmunotherapy (CIT); 4) sensitive to BTK inhibitors (BTKi).

Each group will undergo central pathology revision with other immunohistochemical studies (Verona, Dr. Parisi; Milano, Prof. Ponzoni; Vicenza, Dr. D'Amore; Brescia, Prof. Facchetti). Formaline-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) diagnostic specimens of Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) will be screened by immunohistochemistry for the expression of immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chains to identify Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) cases lacking Immunoglobulin (Ig) expression.

Cytofluorimetric and molecular studies will be performed in the laboratories of the Verona University and at IFOM (Istituto FIRC di Oncologia Molecolare (FIRC = Fondazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro)). Specific methods will be used: Flow cytometry for the status of surface Ig expression and multiplexed phospho-specific flow cytometry, NGS (Next Generation Sequencing), Immunoglobulin (IgH/IgL V(D)J) profiling by BIOMED2 protocol-based, NGS (Next Generation Sequencing) technology in the relapsed-refractory mantle cell lymphoma (R/R MCL) cases, Chromatin accessibility studies by Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) (on viable cell suspensions or frozen pellets) and Gene Expression Profiling (GEP) by RNA-sequencing and RNA studies of the MALT1-MYC ((Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1 - MYC) pathway.
