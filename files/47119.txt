Adjuvant Therapy for High-risk Hepatocellular Carcinoma Post Liver Transplantation
1. Explore the impact of postoperative administration of multi-kinase inhibitors (including sorafenib, lenvatinib, and regorafenib) in conjunction with bevacizumab on post-transplant recurrence, overall survival, and drug safety in liver transplant recipients at high risk of recurrence in hepatocellular carcinoma.
2. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of multi-kinase inhibitors in combination with bevacizumab as adjuvant therapy in liver transplant recipients with hepatocellular carcinoma who present high-risk factors for recurrence, based on the one-year recurrence-free survival rate (1-year RFS rate).
3. The secondary objectives of this study are to assess the effectiveness and safety of multi-kinase inhibitors in combination with bevacizumab as adjuvant therapy in liver transplant recipients with hepatocellular carcinoma who present high-risk factors for recurrence, based on the following parameters: Recurrence-free survival (RFS) duration, Overall survival (OS), Two-year and three-year RFS rates, Graft survival, Quality of life evaluation (QoL), Incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events.

DRUG: multi-kinase inhibitors in combination with bevacizumab
EFFICACY: One-year recurrence-free survival rate (1-year RFS rate), One-year recurrence-free survival rate (1-year RFS rate): The one-year recurrence-free survival rate represents the proportion of patients, within a specified study population, who remain free from disease recurrence for at least one year following a designated treatment or intervention., Baseline up to 12 months
EFFICACY: Recurrence-free survival (RFS) duration, Recurrence-free survival (RFS) duration: From randomization to the time of disease recurrence evidence or any cause-induced mortality., Baseline up to approximately 12 months|EFFICACY: Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS): The duration from randomization to mortality caused by any underlying factors serves as a crucial metric for evaluating the impact of interventions on study participants., Baseline up to approximately 3 years|EFFICACY: Two-year and three-year RFS rates, Two-year and three-year RFS rates: The two-year and three-year RFS rate represents the proportion of patients, within a specified study population, who remain free from disease recurrence for at least two or three year following a designated treatment or intervention., Baseline up to approximately 2-3 years|EFFICACY and SAFETY: Graft survival, Graft survival: The interval between the commencement of randomization and the occurrence of graft loss is a pivotal time frame in transplantation research. In cases where patients are unaware of graft loss or when graft loss is not documented upon patient demise without confirmed graft loss, the time of graft loss is retrospectively evaluated using either the date of the last documented contact or the date of death., Baseline up to approximately 3 years|QUALITY OF LIFEï¼šQuality of life evaluation, Quality of life evaluation (QoL) according by FACT-Hep., Baseline up to approximately 3 years|SAFETY: Incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events, Incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events. Grade by CTCAE 5.0., Baseline up to approximately 3 years
To investigate the effect of multikinase inhibitors (including sorafenib, lenvatinib and donafinib) combined with bevacizumab on recurrence, survival and safety in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at high risk of recurrence after liver transplantation.
