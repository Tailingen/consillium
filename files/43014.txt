Laparoscopic Approach to Cancer of the Endometrium
The primary objective of this study is to assess disease-free survival at 4.5 years postoperatively for women with apparent Stage 1 endometrial cancer, comparing patients who are randomised to receive Total Laparoscopic Hysterectomy (TLH) and patients who are randomised to receive Total Abdominal Hysterectomy (TAH).
Endometrial Cancer
PROCEDURE: Total Abdominal Hysterectomy|PROCEDURE: Total Laparoscopic Hysterectomy
Disease free survival, 4.5 years from surgery
Intra/Peri/Post-operative and long-term morbidity, 30 days from surgery|Patterns of recurrence, 4.5 years from surgery|Pain and analgesia, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months postoperative.|Quality of Life, Measured at baseline, then again 1 week, 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months postoperatively.
This phase III international, multicenter, open-label, randomized clinical trial is an equivalence study with the hypothesis is that Total Laparoscopic Hysterectomy (TLH) is associated with equivalent disease-free survival when compared to the standard treatment of Total Abdominal Hysterectomy (TAH) for women with apparent Stage I endometrial cancer.

The secondary hypotheses are:

* TLH is associated with equivalent or improved Quality of Life (QoL) at 6 months;
* TLH is associated with reduced treatment-related morbidity;
* TLH is associated with shorter hospital stay;
* TLH is associated with less analgesic consumption;
* TLH is cost effective;
* TLH is associated with improved pelvic floor function.
