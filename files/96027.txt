A Study of Olaparib and Pembrolizumab in People with Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) or Hormone Receptor-positive HER2-negative Breast Cancer
This study will test any good and bad effects of combining the study drugs pembrolizumab and olaparib, given before the standard surgical procedure, to treat TNBC or HR+ HER2- breast cancers. The study drugs could shrink cancer, but they could also cause side effects. The study researchers want to find out whether the study drugs will shrink the cancer by a certain percentage compared with its current size, which may improve the outcome of surgery.
