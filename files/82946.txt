Study of Safety and Efficacy of KTE-C19 in Combination With Atezolizumab in Adults With Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)
The primary objective of phase 1 is to evaluate the safety of KTE-C19 and atezolizumab combination regimens.

The primary objective of phase 2 is to evaluate the efficacy of KTE-C19 and atezolizumab, as measured by complete response rate in participants with refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

Participants who received an infusion of KTE-C19 will complete the remainder of the 15 year follow-up assessments in a separate long-term follow-up study, KT-US-982-5968 (NCT05041309).

BIOLOGICAL: KTE-C19|BIOLOGICAL: Atezolizumab|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Fludarabine
Phase 1: Number of Participants Experiencing Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), A DLT was defined as the following KTE-C19-related or ATZ-related events with an onset from immediately after the first ATZ infusion through 21 days after the first ATZ infusion: Grade 4 hematologic toxicity lasting \> 30 days (except lymphopenia or B-cell aplasia); All KTE-C19- or ATZ-related Grade 3 non-hematologic toxicities lasting for \> 7 days and all KTE-C19- or ATZ-related Grade 4 non-hematologic toxicities regardless of duration., Baseline up to 21 days|Phase 1 and 2: Complete Response Rate (CRR), CRR was assessed based on the International Working Group Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson, 2007), and was defined as the percentage of participants achieving a complete response (CR) as assessed by the study investigators. CR was defined as the complete resolution of all disease-related radiological abnormalities and the disappearance of all signs and symptoms related to the disease., From enrollment until first occurrence of CR or PR (maximum duration: 6.2 years)
Phase 1 and 2: Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was assessed based on the International Working Group Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson, 2007), and was defined as the percentage of participants achieving a CR or partial response (PR) as assessed by the study investigators. CR was defined as the complete resolution of all disease-related radiological abnormalities and the disappearance of all signs and symptoms related to the disease. PR was defined at least a 50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to six of the largest dominant nodes or nodal masses. Participants who did not meet the criteria for objective response by the analysis cutoff date were considered non-responders., From enrollment until first occurrence of CR or PR (maximum duration: 6.2 years)|Phase 1 and 2: Duration of Response (DOR), DOR for participants who experienced an objective response was defined as the date of their first confirmed objective response (CR or PR) to disease progression per the revised International Working Group Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson, 2007) or death regardless of cause. CR was defined as the complete resolution of all disease-related radiological abnormalities and the disappearance of all signs and symptoms related to the disease. PR was defined at least a 50% decrease in SPD of up to six of the largest dominant nodes or nodal masses. Disease progression was defined as any new lesion or increase by ≥ 50% of previously involved sites from nadir. The Kaplan-Meier approach was used to estimate DOR., From the date of first confirmed objective response (CR or PR) to disease progression or death regardless of cause (maximum duration: 6.2 years)|Phase 1 and 2: Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from the KTE-C19 infusion date to the date of disease progression per the revised International Working Group Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson, 2007) or death from any cause. Disease progression was defined as any new lesion or increase by ≥ 50% of previously involved sites from nadir. The Kaplan-Meier approach was used to estimate PFS., From the date of first KTE-C19 infusion to disease progression or death regardless of cause (maximum duration: 6.2 years)|Phase 1 and 2: Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from KTE-C19 infusion to the date of death from any cause. The Kaplan-Meier approach was used to estimate OS., From the date of first KTE-C19 infusion to the date of death regardless of cause (maximum duration: 6.2 years)|Phase 1 and 2: Percentage of Participants Experiencing Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), An adverse event was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial participant. The event did not necessarily have a relationship with study treatment. Adverse events included worsening of a pre-existing medical condition. Worsening indicated that the pre-existing medical condition had increased in severity, frequency, and/or duration or had an association with a worse outcome. A pre-existing condition that had not worsened during the study or involved an intervention such as elective cosmetic surgery or a medical procedure while in study, was not considered an adverse event. TEAEs included all AEs with onset on or after initiation of axicabtagene ciloleucel., Up to 1.8 years|Phase 1 and 2: Percentage of Participants With Serum Chemistry Toxicity Grade Shifts to Grade 3 or Higher Resulting From Increased Parameter Values, Post axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion lab toxicities were reported.
