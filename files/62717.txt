PET-MRI Esophagus Feasibility Study
This is a single arm, single centre, investigator initiated study to investigate the feasibility of using PET-MRI imaging in radiation treatment workflow in up to 15 patients with esophagogastric cancer. PET-MRI imaging will be completed before the start of radiation treatment. MRI imaging will be completed during radiation treatment and after radiation treatment. These images will not be used to plan the radiation treatment and routine clinical care will be provided.

The goal of this study is to gather information that will allow the radiation team to include MRI and PET imaging into the radiation treatment workflow for patients with esophageal cancer receiving radiation therapy in the future.
