Safety & Efficacy Study of AT-101 in Combination w/ Rituximab in Previously Untreated Grade I-II Follicular Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
This is a phase II clinical trial in patients who have not received systemic treatment for follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The study combines rituximab, an approved drug for this disease, with AT-101, an experimental drug. The hypothesis is that by adding AT-101 to the rituximab regimen, improvement to patients' response to the treatment will be observed verses rituximab alone.
