Prostate Diffusion Imaging With Distortion Correction
There has been literature demonstrating the effectiveness of correcting these MRI images by using an additional measurement of the magnetic field, but the implied improvement in lesion detection in these common distorted regions in the prostate has yet to be shown.

We propose that introducing this distortion correction would greatly improve the DWI images used for tumour detection. For this study we propose testing this hypothesis as a primary objective, and as a secondary objective including additional b-values to further refine the ADC value. The study involves adding one additional distortion correcting scan to the standard clinical study, adding approximately 2 minutes to the study.
