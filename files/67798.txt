Serplulimab Combined With Anti-VEGF Antibody in Advanced Lung Adenocarcinoma
In order to further evaluate the efficacy of immunotherapy combined with antivascular therapy in the real world, we used Serpluimab combined with Bevacizumab and platinum-based chemotherapy in previously untreated EGFR/ALK-negative advanced non-squamous NSCLC patients, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this regimen.
