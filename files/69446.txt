PET Imaging of Ovarian Carcinoma With 18F-FSPG
This clinical trial studies positron emission tomography (PET) imaging utilizing 18F-FSPG \[(S)-4-(3-\[18F\]Fluoropropyl)-L-glutamic acid\], a glutamic acid derivative, to image patients with ovarian cancer before undergoing surgery or transplant. Diagnostic procedures, such as 18F-FSPG PET, may help find and diagnose ovarian cancer and find out how far the disease has spread.

Lesion (S)-4-(3-[18F]Fluoropropyl)-L-glutamic acid (18F-FSPG) PET standard uptake values, Up to 2 years|Number of lesions detected by(S)-4-(3-[18F]Fluoropropyl)-L-glutamic acid (18F-FSPG) PET, Up to 2 years|Number of lesions detected by (S)-4-(3-[18F]Fluoropropyl)-L-glutamic acid (18F-FSPG) PET imaging before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment, Up to 2 years
Immunohistochemistry evaluation of xC- and CD 44 of resected malignant ovarian cancer with a measurement of strength of staining from 0-3., All imaging data (SUV) will be correlated to definitive, ex vivo diagnostic pathology and immunoreactivity (xC-, CD44), which will be carried out for every patient with resected tissue. and, when IHC scoring will be in terms of strength of immunostaining (scored on an ordinal scale of 0 3). This treatment of lesion-based sensitivity and specificity has not been previously described in the ovarian cancer literature., Up to 2 years|Proportion of patients whose surgical resection by novel imaging classification changed following validation by histological confirmation, Up to 2 years|Proportion of patients whose response to chemotherapy changed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria, Up to 2 years|Conditional predictive models of imaging performance and agreement, We will test that lesion 18F-FSPG PET SUV's are significantly greater than background (normal liver tissue) by tissue assessment of number of lesions noted in each arm and after treatment., Up to 2 years
