A Prospective Single-Center Evaluation of SureForm™ Staplers in Robotic-assisted Colorectal Procedures
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of SureForm™ Staplers (60 and 45) for transection and/or creation of anastomosis during robotic-assisted colorectal procedures.
Benign Colon Tumor|Malignant Colorectal Tumor|Benign Colorectal Neoplasm
PROCEDURE: Colorectal resection
Number of SureForm™ Stapler fires and reload colors, The primary endpoint of the study is to assess the number of fires and reload colors of SureForm™ Staplers utilized for the transection and/or creation of anastomosis during robotic-assisted colorectal procedures., During the procedure
Incidence of peri-operative and short term outcomes, The secondary endpoint of the study is to assess the incidence of peri-operative and short term outcomes following transection and/or creation of anastomosis using SureForm™ Staplers during robotic-assisted colorectal procedures., 30 days post-operative
This is a prospective, single-center observational study to evaluate the performance of SureForm™ Staplers during robotic-assisted resections of either ascending or transverse or descending or sigmoid colon or rectum. Subjects with either a suspected or confirmed benign or malignant disease of the colon and rectum who are scheduled to undergo a robotic-assisted resection of the colon or rectum will be asked to provide informed consent for their participation in the study.

The study will be conducted at one institution with two surgeons performing the colorectal procedures. The surgeons will be using either the da Vinci Xi or X Surgical System which ever they use as per their standard of care for the colorectal procedure. Stapling will be performed with SureForm™ Staplers and any of the reloads as per the surgeon's standard of care for the transection and/or creation of anastomosis during robotic-assisted colorectal procedures.
