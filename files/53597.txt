RC48 for Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy of HER2 Positive Breast Cancer
This is a single-arm exploratory study to explore the effect of RC48 in HER2-positive neoadjuvant therapy and evaluate the non-inferiority of RC48 by comparing the latest reported data of T-DM1 in neoadjuvant therapy.
Breast Cancer|HER2-positive Breast Cancer
DRUG: Recombinant humanized anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody-MMAE coupling agent (RC48-ADC)
Pathological complete response rate (pCR), absence of invasive carcinoma in the breast and axillary lymph nodes, while residual ductal carcinoma in situ was accepted (ypT0orTisypN0)., At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 14 days)
adverse effects, Serious adverse effect occur within neoadjuvant chemotherapy, during the period of neadjuvant chemotherapy
A single-arm exploratory study was conducted in 20 patients with HER2-positive breast cancer to explore the effect of RC48 in HER2-positive neoadjuvant therapy (treatment regimen: RC482.0 mg/kg, intravenous drip, once every 2 weeks). After 4-6 cycles, surgery was performed to evaluate the effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The latest reported data of T-DM1 in neoadjuvant therapy were compared to evaluate the non-inferiority of RC48.
