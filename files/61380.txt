Skeletal Muscle Energy Metabolism in Women With Weight Loss and Ovarian and/or Endometrial Cancer With Weight Loss
the aim is to study skeletal muscle metabolism alterations métaboliques associated with weight loss in women with ovarian and/or endometrial cancer according to BMI.
Weight Loss|Ovarian Carcinoma|Endometrial Carcinoma
OTHER: Samples
Measurement of muscle mitochondrial bioenergetics according to BMI, Measurement of muscle mitochondrial bioenergetics by high resolution oxygraphy, muscle biopsy realized during surgery
on muscle biopsy, * Quantification of lipids on electron microscope
* Type of muscular fibers
* Analyze of gene expression and proteins involved in 1/ Mitochondrial metabolism 2/ lipid metabolism and 3/ muscular proteolysis by RTqPCR with SyBR Green and Western Blot, muscle biopsy realized during surgery|on white adipose tissue, adipose tissue composition (fatty acids quantification, sterols, steroids)

* RT-qPCR quantification of molecules involved in lipid metabolism (synthesis, transport) and in inflammation (immune profile and cytokines)
* RTqPCR analysis, western blot and immunohistochemical expression of markers of transformation into brown adipose tissue
* in specific milieu, in vitro experimentation on skeletal muscular cells, adipose tissue samples taken during surgery|on ovarian cancer tumor samples, * lipid composition (fatty acids quantification, sterols, steroids)
* RT-qPCR quantification of molecules involved in lipid metabolism (synthesis, transport) and in inflammation (immune profil and cytokines)
* culture of tumour cells to evaluate resistance to chemotherapy (platinum), ovarian tumor biopsies realized during surgery|on computerized tomography, assessment of body composition (fat and muscle compartments), 1 day of abdominal CT scan imaging procedure performed at diagnosis
