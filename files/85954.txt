Consolidation Therapy With Hu3S193 for Women With Ovarian, Primary Peritoneal or Fallopian Tube Cancer
RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as Hu3S193, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well Hu3S193 works as a consolidation therapy for women with relapsing platinum-sensitive ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer.
Fallopian Tube Cancer|Ovarian Cancer|Peritoneal Cavity Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Monoclonal antibody Hu3S193
