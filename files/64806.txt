Hydroxychloroquine in Treating Patients With Solid Tumors Undergoing Radiation Therapy for Bone Metastases
This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of hydroxychloroquine in treating patients with solid tumors undergoing radiation therapy for bone metastases. Drugs, such as hydroxychloroquine, may make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy
Bone Metastases|Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific
DRUG: hydroxychloroquine|RADIATION: radiation therapy
MTD of hydroxychloroquine that can be safely administered to cancer patients in association with radiotherapy, Safety assessments weekly during treatment and at 4 weeks post-radiotherapy, 12 weeks
OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of hydroxychloroquine that can safely be administered to cancer patients in association with radiation prior to developing this approach for disease treatment.

OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

Beginning 3 days before the initiation of radiotherapy, patients receive hydroxychloroquine orally (PO) once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID). Treatment continues until completion of radiotherapy.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks.
