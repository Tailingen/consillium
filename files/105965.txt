It is planned to develop a study with a larger number of patients with lung cancer, including the population of Spain and Latin American countries to obtain a sample of more diverse and heterogeneous characteristics, with clinical, cultural, and sociodemographic differences. This will make it possible to obtain better and greater data and therefore define the clinical and treatment factors significantly associated with DS in these individuals and obtain a more complete vision of the reality of the problem.

The results of this research will make it possible to carry out interventions specifically directed at this population and to modify the oncological follow-up guidelines currently in force. Likewise, the information collected will serve as the basis for generating new protocols for a multidisciplinary approach, including the participation of psychology and specialists in urology, gynecology, and psychiatry.
