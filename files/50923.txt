Study of ABT-700 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1/1b open-label study evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary efficacy of ABT-700 in subjects with advanced solid tumors that may have MET amplification or c-Met overexpression. ABT-700, previously known as h224G11 in publications, is an anti-c-Met antibody. The early clinical development plan for ABT-700 is based on the activity demonstrated in preclinical models. Up to 124 subjects will be enrolled.
