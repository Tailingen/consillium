Inheritance of Osteosarcoma & Paget's Disease Through Chromosome 18:
Researchers have previously demonstrated loss of heterozygosity in a region on chromosome 18q, associated with osteogenic sarcomas in bone affected by Paget's disease. The loci used in this study are specifically described by those authors as showing loss of heterozygosity in 6 of 7 affected families.
