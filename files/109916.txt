A Study of Recombinant Vaccinia Virus Prior to Sorafenib to Treat Unresectable Primary Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The purpose of this pilot safety study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of JX-594 (Pexa-Vec) administered intravenously and intratumorally prior to standard sorafenib therapy.
Carcinoma, Hepatocellular
DRUG: JX-594 followed by sorafenib
Determine safety and tolerability of intravenous infusion of JX-594 followed by intratumoral injections with JX-594 prior to standard sorafenib therapy, Adverse events will be collected and assessed to assess safety and tolerability through 28 days after last dose of JX-594 (or until all events considered probably or possibly related to JX-594 have resolved, stabilized, or returned to baseline status)., Safety evaluations through 28 days after last dose of JX-594
Determine Disease Control Rate (DCR) at 12 weeks, DCR: confirmed complete response, partial response or stable disease based on modified RECIST and/or Choi response criteria, Disease control and response assessment at 12 weeks from first JX-594 dose|Determine radiographic response rate, Response rate evaluation based on modified RECIST and/or Choi response criteria, Periodically throughout study participation (average of up to 1 year)|Determine overall survival time, Ongoing (average of 1 year)
The purpose of this pilot safety study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of JX-594 (Pexa-Vec) administered intravenously and intratumorally prior to standard sorafenib therapy.
