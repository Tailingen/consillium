Minimally Invasive Interval Debulking Surgery in Ovarian Neoplasm: a Feasibility Study
Phase II multicentric study
Stage IV Ovarian Carcinoma|Effects of Chemotherapy|Peritoneal Cavity Cancer
PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic interval debulking surgery
Operative complication rate, Intra- and post-operative complication rate of total laparoscopic/robotic interval debulking surgery, 30 days
Progression Free survival, time to recurrence, one year|Overall Survival, time to last follow up/death, One year
The aim of this prospective Phase II multicentric study is to assess feasibility and early complications rate of "total laparoscopic/robotic" interval debulking surgery in patients with a clinical complete/partial response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for advanced ovarian cancer.
