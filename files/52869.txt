Study of the Change of Breast Cancer Patients' Upper Limb Lymphatic Drainage Pathway After Operation
Lymphoscintigraphy is a noninvasive，accurate and effective imaging modality. In this study, it is used to investigate the imaging characteristics of patients'upper limb lymphatic drainage before operation, and the influence of operation on it.
Lymphedema of Upper Arm
Number and relationship with the sentinel lymph node of lymph nodes containing 99mTc-Dextran injected preoperatively to do upper limb lymphoscintigraphy and resected in the process of the sentinel lymph node biopsy, Patients enrolled undertake upper limb lymphoscintigraphy before sentinel lymph node biopsy(SLNB).The lymph nodes draining upper extremity lymph will contain 99mTc-Dextran and can be detected by γ detector during operation. The number and relationship with the sentinel lymph node can be measured., During operation|Number of lymph nodes containing 99mTc-Dextran injected preoperatively to do upper limb lymphoscintigraphy and resected in the process of the axillary lymph node dissection, Patients enrolled undertake upper limb lymphoscintigraphy before axillary lymph node dissection(ALND).The lymph nodes draining upper extremity lymph can be detected by γ detector in the tissue resected and axilla after operation. The number of them can be measured., During operation
Pathological result of lymph nodes containing 99mTc-Dextran injected preoperatively to do upper limb lymphoscintigraphy and resected in the process of the sentinel lymph node biopsy, The pathological result of lymph nodes containing 99mTc-Dextran injected preoperatively to do upper limb lymphoscintigraphy and resected in the process of the sentinel lymph node biopsy will be reported in 5 days after operation, in 5 days after operation|Pathological result of lymph nodes containing 99mTc-Dextran injected preoperatively to do upper limb lymphoscintigraphy and resected in the process of the axillary lymph node dissection, The pathological result of lymph nodes containing 99mTc-Dextran injected preoperatively to do upper limb lymphoscintigraphy and resected in the process of the axillary lymph node dissection will be reported in 5 days after operation, in 5 days after operation
Patient upper limb circumference, The patients' upper limb circumference will be measured on 1 day before operation and 6 months, 1 year, 1.5year, 2 year, 2.5 year, 3 year, 4 year after operation, 1 day before operation and 6 months, 1 year, 1.5year, 2 year, 2.5 year, 3 year, 4 year after operation|Patients' bioimpedence value, The bioelectrical impedance measurement was performed during follow-up, 2016-2019
The global burden of breast cancer continues to increase largely because of the aging and growth of the world population. More than 1.38 million women worldwide were estimated to be diagnosed with breast cancer in 2008, accounting for 23% of all diagnosed cancers in women. Given that the 5-year survival rate for breast cancer is now 90%, experiencing breast cancer is ultimately about quality of life. Women treated for breast cancer are facing a life-time risk of developing lymphedema, a chronic condition that occurs in up to 40% of this population and negatively affects breast cancer survivors' quality of life. It's becoming more and more important to do more research on the breast cancer-related lymphedema. Axillary reverse mapping (ARM) is a technique used to map arm lymphatic drainage during axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and/or sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND). It's necessary for the investigators to understand the participants' upper limb lymphatic drainage before operation and what the investigators have done on it during operation. It can be easy to understand the influence of operation on the participants' upper limb lymphatic drainage, the possibility and safety of reserving lymph nodes draining the upper extremity lymph.
