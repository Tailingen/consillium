H002 in Patients With EGFR Mutation Locally Advanced or Metastatic NSCLC
This is a phase I/IIa, open-label, dose-escalation and expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK and preliminary anti-tumor activity of H002 when given orally in patients with EGFR mutation-positive locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

The study will contain two parts: Part A is dose escalation phase (i.e., Phase I) and Part B is dose expansion phase (i.e., Phase IIa).
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: H002 capsule
DOSE ESCALATION PHASE：Incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) at Cycle 0 and Cycle1. Incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), with severity determined according to National Cancer Institute (NCI) CTCAE v5.0., To evaluate the safety and tolerability of H002 and to determine the maximal tolerable dose (MTD), or if possible, a dose/exposure predicted to result in optimal biological dose (OBD) or recommended phase II dose (RP2D)., At the end of Cycle 1 (include 4 days in Cycle 0 and 21 days in Cycle1)|DOSE EXPANSION PHASE：Objective Response Rate (ORR), To obtain a preliminary evaluation of the anti-tumor activity at the selected dose(s) of H002 when given orally as determined according to RECIST v1.1., [Time Frame: Up to approximately 30 months]|DOSE EXPANSION PHASE：To evaluate the incidence and severity of TEAEs, with severity determined according to NCI CTCAE v5.0., To evaluate the safety at the selected dose(s) of H002 when given orally., Up to approximately 30 months

Part A (Dose Escalation Phase) Approximately 36 subjects will be enrolled, based on the "3+3" design for dose escalation and safety evaluation requirements. The total number of subjects will depend upon the number of dose escalations necessary.

Part B (Dose Expansion Phase) Up to 20 subjects will be enrolled in each expansion arm, the total number of subjects will depend upon the number of dose expansions (expansions may be at more than one dose depending upon emerging data).
