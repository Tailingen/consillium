Objectives:

* Evaluate the clinical effectiveness of a multi-level telehealth-based intervention for rural hospitals consisting of provider access to tumor board expertise that incorporates disease, patient and molecular tumor characteristics, together with patient access to a supportive care intervention to improve cancer care delivery.
* Evaluate the facilitators and barriers to future larger-scale dissemination and implementation of the multi-level intervention, designed to enhance quality rural cancer care delivery.
