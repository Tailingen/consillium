Improving Patient and Caregiver Understanding of Risks and Benefits of Immunotherapy for Advanced Cancer
The purpose of this study is to refine and pilot test educational material developed to educate and support patients receiving immunotherapy for advanced cancer.

The intervention is an educational video and question prompt list (QPL) to promote communication between patients, caregivers, and the oncology team about the risks and benefits of immunotherapy.

Feasibility - enrollment, Feasibility of the trial will be demonstrated if at least 70% of approached participants are enrolled, Day 1|Feasibility, defined as completion of study activities, 80% of participants randomized to the intervention watch the video and review the QPL., Baseline to 72 hours|Change in participant knowledge, using the Immunotherapy Knowledge Assessment, The primary outcome is participant knowledge, as measured by the Immunotherapy Knowledge Assessment, a 9-item survey with higher scores representing greater knowledge (minimum score = 0, maximum score =9). The investigators will compute the total knowledge score at baseline and 72 hours., Baseline to 72 hours|Change in participant knowledge, using the Immunotherapy Knowledge Assessment, The primary outcome is participant knowledge, Immunotherapy Knowledge Assessment, a 9-item survey with higher scores representing greater knowledge (Minimum score = 0, maximum score = 9). The investigators will compute the total knowledge score at baseline and 6 weeks., Baseline to 6 weeks
Change in participant anxiety, using the State Subscale of the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory, The investigators will use the State Subscale of the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory and baseline and 72 hours. Higher scores indicate greater anxiety (minimum score = 20, maximum score = 80)., Baseline to 72 hours|Change in participant anxiety, using the State Subscale of the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory, The investigators will use the State Subscale of the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory and baseline and 6 weeks. Higher scores indicate greater anxiety (minimum score = 20, maximum score = 80), Baseline to 6 weeks|Patient questions asked in visit with oncologist, The number of questions asked by patients and caregivers will be assessed by coding the transcripts of audio-recorded oncology visits and compared between arms using the negative binomial model., 72 hours
This two-part study will 1) refine and 2) pilot test an intervention to improve participant's and caregiver knowledge and increase communication with the oncology team about immunotherapy.

* The intervention involves watching a video developed to educate patients regarding the risks, benefits, and potential outcomes of immunotherapy treatment and reviewing an immunotherapy-focused QPL prior to ICI initiation.
* In Part 1 of this study, investigators will conduct a small open pilot to refine the intervention and study procedures.
* In Part 2, investigators will conduct a single-site pilot randomized controlled trial including 130 patients and their caregivers, to evaluate the feasibility of intervention delivery, and the preliminary efficacy of the intervention in improving patient and caregiver knowledge.
