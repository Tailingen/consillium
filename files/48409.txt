Randomized Phase III-Study in Stage IIIb and IV Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer. Sequential Single-Agent vs. Double-Agent vs. Triple-Agent Therapy.
This study wants to assess different intensive therapy sequences for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer.

It claims less on the efficacy of different chemotherapy combinations, than more on the comparison of different strategies of sequential single-agent, sequential double-agent or sequential triple-agent therapy.
