Clinical Study of the Efficacy of CD19-CAR-DNT Cells in the Treatment of Relapsed/Refractory B-cell NHL
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of CD19-CAR-DNT cells infusion in subjects with relapsed/refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: CD19-CAR-DNT cells
DLT, To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and determine the recommended dosage of CD19-CAR-DNT Cell Therapy for Relapsed/Refractory B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, Up to 28 days|MTD, MTD was the highest dose for DLT in ≤1/6 subjects, Up to 28 days|Incidence of abnormalities, Incidence of abnormalities in AE/SAE/AESI/laboratory tests/electrocardiograms/vital signs., Up to 28 days
Pharmacokinetics (PK) indicator (Cmax), The peak concentration of CD19-CAR-DNT cells amplified in the peripheral blood (Cmax, detected by qPCR)., Up to 90 days|Pharmacokinetics (PK) indicator (AUC), CD19-CAR-DNT cells blood concentrations will be measured at different time points to evaluate the area under the curve (AUC). (AUC, detected by qPCR)., Up to 90 days|Pharmacokinetics (PK) indicator (Tmax), CD19-CAR-DNT cells blood concentrations will be measured at different time points to evaluate the peak plasma time (Tmax). Tmax is defined as the time to reach the highest concentration (Tmax, detected by qPCR)., Up to 90 days|Pharmacokinetics (PK) indicator (T1/2), CD19-CAR-DNT cells blood concentrations will be measured at different time points to evaluate the elimination half-life in hours (T1/2). T1/2 is defined as the time point when the concentration of CD19-CAR-DNT reaches half of maximum in a patient's peripheral blood (T1/2, detected by qPCR)., Up to 90 days|Overall Response Rate, The proportion of CR or PR patients as assessed by investigators based on Lugano 2014 Response Assessment, Up to 2 years|Disease Control Rate, The percentage of PR, CR and SD patients in the total patient population, Up to 2 years|Duration of Response, The time from the start of the first assessment of CR or PR to the first assessment as disease recurrence or progression or death, Up to 2 years|Progression Free Survival, The length of time that a participant's disease did not progress during or after CD19-CAR-DNT treatment., Up to 2 years|Overall Survival, From the date of entry into the clinical study until death from any cause, Up to 15 years
This is an open, single-arm, single-dose, dose-escalation and dose-expansion clinical trial designed to evaluate the maximum tolerated dose of CD19-CAR-DNT cells, the safety, the preliminary efficacy and the pharmacokinetic profile of CD19-CAR-DNT cells in vivo after infusion in clinical studies. 9 patients are planned to be enrolled in the dose-escalation trial (1×10\^6 CD19-CAR-DNT cells/kg, 3×10\^6 CD19-CAR-DNT cells/kg, 9×10\^6 CD19-CAR-DNT cells/kg) and 3 patients in the dose-expansion trial. The primary endpoints are DLT, MTD, and the incidence of abnormalities in AE/SAE/AESI/laboratory tests/electrocardiograms/vital signs.
