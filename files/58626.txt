This was a prospective, multi-center, open-label, randomized, Phase IIIb study evaluating efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib versus BAT as selected by the Investigator in patients with PV who are resistant to, or intolerant of HU.

The study comprised of the following periods:

Screening Period (up to 5 weeks: Day -35 to Day -1): Screening evaluations were performed at one or more clinic visits, and reviewed to determine eligibility before the patient was randomized in the study.

Core Treatment Period (Day 1 to Week 80):

Patients were randomized in 1:1 ratio to either treatment group (ruxolitinib or BAT) and were to be treated with their randomized treatment.

Crossover Treatment Period (Week 28 or after) for BAT patients only:

Patients randomized to BAT who did not respond by Week 28 were eligible to crossover and start treatment with ruxolitinib. Patients crossing over on or after Week 28 had to complete all assessments for the End of Treatment (EoT) visit of the Core Treatment Period followed by the assessments in Cross-over visit evaluation schedule.

Extended Treatment Period (Week 80 to Week 260):

Patients receiving ruxolitinib at Week 80 (including patients who have crossed over from BAT) were eligible to continue up to Week 260 in the Extended Treatment Period. Patients continued the ruxolitinib dose that they received at Week 80. Patients who received BAT at Week 80 were not eligible to enter the Extended Treatment Period and had to have the EoT visit at Week 80 and an End of study (EoS) visit 30 days after the EoT visit.

Follow-up Period:

Patients were followed for safety during 30 days after the last dose of study drug and EoS visit assessments were performed post 30 days after the last dose of study drug. Patients who completed EoT (Week 80 for patients who received BAT, Week 260 for patients who received ruxolitinib or from the time of premature discontinuation) were to be followed-up for every 3 months for survival till the end of the study.
