L-NMMA Plus Taxane Chemotherapy in Refractory Locally Advanced or Metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients
This is a Phase Ib/II study assessing the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), and efficacy of L-NMMA when combined with docetaxel in refractory locally advanced or metastatic triple negative breast cancer patients. The Phase Ib portion of the study is designed to investigate the combination at two dose levels of docetaxel (75 and 100 mg/m2) and 7 dose levels of L-NMMA (5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, 15, 17.5, and 20 mg/kg). The starting dose of L-NMMA will be 7.5 mg/kg. In the Phase II portion of the study, the starting dose will be the RP2D determined in the Phase Ib portion of the study.
Metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer
DRUG: L-NMMA|DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Amlodipine|DRUG: Pegfilgrastim|DRUG: Enteric-coated aspirin
Asses the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of L-NMMA When Combined With Docetaxel/Amlodipine in the Treatment of Refractory Locally Advanced or Metastatic TNBC Patients, Based on the Number of Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) Per Dose Level., The Phase Ib portion of the study is designed to investigate the combination at two dose levels of docetaxel (75 and 100 mg/m2) and 7 dose levels of L-NMMA (5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, 15, 17.5, and 20 mg/kg). The starting dose will be L-NMMA at 7.5 mg/kg and docetaxel at 75 mg/m2. As patients are accrued, a standard Bayesian model averaging continual reassessment method (CRM) approach will be used to determine the appropriate dosage. For a dose level to be chosen as the MTD, at least 4 patients must have received said dose without experiencing a significant number of DLTs based on the Bayesian Model Averaging Continual Reassessment Method., DLTs assessment window is the duration required for completing one full cycle (through Day 21).|Clinical Benefit Rate, Primary Outcome Measure for Phase II: Determine the number of participants with complete response, partial response, or stable disease after 6 cycles of L-NMMA combined with taxane chemotherapy (docetaxel, paclitaxel, or nab-paclitaxel)/amlodipine, as assessed by the RECIST 1.1.

* CR (complete response) = disappearance of all target lesions
* PR (partial response) = 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions
* PD (progressive disease) = 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions
* SD (stable disease) = small changes that do not meet above criteria
* Treatment Failure: taken off the study because of adverse events before the first restaging scan after cycle 2, The approximate length of the study from Cycle 1, Day 1 will be approximately seven months (approximately four months of treatment plus three months of follow-up).|Asses the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Docetaxel When Combined With L-NMMA/Amlodipine in the Treatment of Refractory Locally Advanced or Metastatic TNBC Patients, Based on the Number of Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) Per Dose Level., The Phase Ib portion of the study is designed to investigate the combination at two dose levels of docetaxel (75 and 100 mg/m2) and 7 dose levels of L-NMMA (5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, 15, 17.5, and 20 mg/kg).

Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) and Other Adverse Events, Describe the DLTs and other adverse events associated with L-NMMA when combined with docetaxel/amlodipine, as assessed by the CTCAE v4.03 Any Grade â‰¥ 3 Adverse Events (AE) unless there is clear alternative evidence that the AE was not caused by the study treatment., The approximate length of the study from Cycle 1, Day 1 will be approximately seven months (approximately four months of treatment plus three months of follow-up).|Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of the L-NMMA and Docetaxel Combination, Determine the RP2D of the L-NMMA and docetaxel combination based on the occurrence of DLTs during Phase Ib portion of the study.

As patients are accrued, they will start with 7.5 mg/kg of L-NMMA and 75 mg/m2 of docetaxel and their DLTs will be assessed after completion of the first cycle. This will determine the next cohort dose, until at least 4 patients receive the dose with minimal DLTs that won't require dose reduction., The Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT) assessment window is the duration required for completing one full cycle (through Day 21).|Antitumor Activity, Assess the antitumor activity of L-NMMA when combined with taxane chemotherapy (docetaxel, paclitaxel, or nab-paclitaxel)/amlodipine, as assessed by the RECIST 1.1.

This is a Phase Ib/II study assessing the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), and efficacy of L-NMMA when combined with docetaxel in refractory locally advanced or metastatic triple negative breast cancer patients. The Phase Ib portion of the study is designed to investigate the combination at two dose levels of docetaxel (75 and 100 mg/m2) and 7 dose levels of L-NMMA (5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, 15, 17.5, and 20 mg/kg). The starting dose of L-NMMA will be 7.5 mg/kg. L-NMMA dose will escalate/de-escalate based on DLT occurrence. For the 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, and 15 mg/kg L-NMMA doses, docetaxel will be administered at 75 mg/m2. For the 17.5 and 20 mg/kg L-NMMA doses, docetaxel will be administered at 100 mg/m2. In the Phase II portion of the study, the starting dose will be the RP2D determined in the Phase Ib portion of the study. In the phase II portion of the study, patients will be treated with L-NMMA and taxane (docetaxel, paclitaxel, or nab-paclitaxel) per physician's choice. Patients will be treated with L-NMMA and taxane chemotherapy (docetaxel, paclitaxel, or nab-paclitaxel) per physician's choice. L-NMMA will be administered on Days 1-5 and taxane chemotherapy on Day 1 Q3W or Day 1 Q1W. L-NMMA and docetaxel will be administered at the RP2D determined in the phase Ib portion of the study. Paclitaxel at 175 mg/m2 will be IV infused over 3 hours or 80 mg/m2 will be IV infused over 1 hour, and nab-paclitaxel at 260 mg/m2 will be IV infused over 30 minutes. For L-NMMA-induced hypertension, amlodipine (10 mg) and enteric-coated low-dose aspirin (81 mg) will be orally administered. Amlodipine will be administered for 6 days at each cycle, starting 24 hours before the first dose of L-NMMA. Enteric-coated low-dose aspirin will be administered once daily during the 6 21-day cycles. For docetaxel-induced leukopenia, pegfilgrastim (6 mg) will be administered via subcutaneous injection approximately 24 hours after every dose of docetaxel.
