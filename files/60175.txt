Dose-Escalation and Dose-Expansion Study of ZX-4081 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
A Phase 1, first-in-human, open-label, multicenter, dose escalation and dose expansion study to investigate the safety, tolerability, PK, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor activity of ZX-4081 administered orally (PO) twice daily (BID) in 28-day cycles in patients with Advanced Solid Tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: ZX-4081
Determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ZX-4081, To assess number of patients experiencing dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in the dose escalation phase, At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Safety and tolerability of ZX-4081, To examine the incidence of clinical and laboratory adverse events after multiple doses of ZX-4081 in the dose escalation and dose expansion phases, From first dose of ZX-4081 through 28 days after the last ZX-4081 treatment (up to 2 years); each cycle is 28 days
Peak Plasma Concentration of ZX-4081, To evaluate the maximum observed concentration (Cmax) after single and repeated oral, twice daily (BID) doses of ZX-4081, Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Area under the plasma concentration of ZX-4081, To evaluate the area under the curve (AUC) plasma-concentration after single and repeated oral, BID doses of ZX-4081, Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Half-life of ZX-4081, To evaluate the half-life of ZX-4081 after single and repeated oral, BID doses of ZX-4081, Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Objective response rate (ORR), To evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) as determined by the specific disease response criteria, Up to 2 years|Duration of Response (DOR), To examine the duration of response (DoR), defined as time from the date of first documentation of response to the date of the first documentation of progressive disease (PD), or death due to any cause, Up to 2 years|Progression Free Survival (PFS), To examine the the progression free survival (PFS), defined as time from the date of first dose of study treatment to the first date of documentation of PD, or death due to any cause, Up to 2 years|Overall Survival (OS), To examine the overall survival (OS), defined as time from the date of first dose of study treatment to death due to any cause, Up to 2 years|Peripheral myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) proportion in the blood, To assess the changes of peripheral MDSC proportion in the blood after single and repeated oral, BID doses of ZX-4081, Cycle 1 Day1 , Cycle 2 Day 1, and Cycle 3 Day 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|T cell composition and activation status, To assess the impact on T cell profiles after repeated oral, BID doses of ZX-4081, Cycle 1 Day1 , Cycle 2 Day 1, and Cycle 3 Day 1 (each cycle is 28 days)
A Phase 1, first-in-human, open-label, multicenter, dose escalation and dose expansion study to investigate the safety, tolerability, PK, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor activity of ZX-4081 administered orally (PO) twice daily (BID) in 28-day cycles in patients with Advanced Solid Tumors.
