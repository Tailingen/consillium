Phase II Umbrella Study of Novel Anti-cancer Agents in Patients With NSCLC Who Progressed on an Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 Containing Therapy
This is an open-label, multi-centre, umbrella Phase II study in patients with metastatic NSCLC who have progressed on an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 containing therapy. This study is modular in design, allowing initial assessment of the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of multiple treatment arms.

Incidence of adverse events/serious adverse events to assess the safety and tolerability of each treatment, Physical examinations, laboratory findings, and vital signs AEs/SAEs collected throughout the study, from informed consent until the safety follow-up visit, Through to study completion, up to 3.5 years.
This is an open-label, multi-centre, umbrella Phase II study in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have progressed on an anti-programmed cell death-1/anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 (anti-PD-1/PD-L1) containing therapy. This study is modular in design, consisting of a number of treatment cohorts, allowing evaluation of the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of multiple treatment arms. There is currently no established therapy for patients who have received immune checkpoint inhibitors and platinum-doublet therapies, and novel treatments are urgently needed.

This protocol has a modular design, with the potential for future treatment arms to be added via protocol amendment.
