A Single Center Pilot Study to Assess the Intra-observer Reliability of Measuring Muscle Strength Using a Hand Held Dynamometer in Children and Adults With Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) and Type 2 (NF2)
Patients with clinically confirmed neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) or neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) or a known neurofibromatosis (NF) mutation aged 5 years and above will be eligible to participate and will be recruited from the neurofibromatosis clinic. Given the need for identifying measures that can reliably and sensitively measure focal muscle weakness and allow for measuring muscle strength as a functional outcome in therapeutic clinical trials in NF, this pilot study will assess the reliability of measuring muscle strength in NF1 and NF2 using a hand-held dynamometer.
Neurofibromatosis 1 and 2 (NF1 and NF2)
BEHAVIORAL: hand-held dynamometer
Intra-class correlation coefficient of strength measurement in the clinically identified weak muscle, A sample size of 20 subjects with three observations per subject achieves 90% power to detect an intraclass correlation of 0.91 under the alternative hypothesis when the intraclass correlation under the null hypothesis is 0.75 using an F-test with a significance level of 0.05., 1 day
Intra-class correlation coefficient of strength measurement in the dominant biceps, A sample size of 20 subjects with three observations per subject achieves 90% power to detect an intraclass correlation of 0.91 under the alternative hypothesis when the intraclass correlation under the null hypothesis is 0.75 using an F-test with a significance level of 0.05., 1 day|standard error of measurement of measuring strength in the weak muscles, 1 day|standard error of measurement of measuring strength in the dominant biceps muscle, 1 day
