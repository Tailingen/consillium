Robotic surgery has many well-known benefits for patients and surgeons, while it comes with higher acquisition and maintenance costs. On the other hand, a higher proportion of minimally invasive procedures can save costs by reducing complications, decreasing hospital stays due to lower morbidity, and saving personnel.

To what extent can robotic surgery be cost-covering or even profitable, depending on the postoperative course? This question is investigated under the conditions of the German DRG system.
