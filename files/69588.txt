Neoadjuvant Study of Palbociclib in Combination With Letrozole and Trastuzumab in Stage II-III ER+ HER2+ Breast Cancer
The investigators propose to influence estrogen receptor (ER) signaling by combining endocrine therapy with CDK4/6 inhibition along with trastuzumab in ER+/ human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)+ early stage breast cancer.
Breast Cancer|Cancer of Breast|Breast Carcinoma
DRUG: Palbociclib|DRUG: Letrozole|BIOLOGICAL: Trastuzumab|DRUG: Goserelin|PROCEDURE: Breast surgery|PROCEDURE: Research tumor biopsy|PROCEDURE: Research bone marrow (OPTIONAL)|PROCEDURE: Research blood sample|GENETIC: Research blood for germline DNA|PROCEDURE: Blood for detection of circulating tumor cells
Number of Participants With Pathologic Complete Response (pCR), A pathologic complete response (pCR) is defined as no histology evidence of invasive tumor cells in the surgical breast specimen and sentinel or axillary lymph nodes., Completion of 4 cycles of treatment (approximately 16 weeks)
Safety and Tolerability of Palbociclib in Combination With Neoadjuvant Letrozole and Trastuzumab (or FDA Approved Biosimilar) as Measured by Number of Participants With Grade 3 & 4 Adverse Events, -The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for all toxicity reporting., 30 days after completion of neoadjuvant therapy (approximately 21 weeks)|Change in Patient Reported Outcomes as Measured by NCI PRO-CTCAE, * Answers ranging from None to Very Severe (none=0 to very severe=4); Not at All to Very Much (not at all=0 to very much=4), Never to Almost Constantly (0=never to almost constantly=4)
* PRO-CTCAE responses are scored from 0 to 4, and there are no standardized scoring rules yet established for how to combine attributes into a single score or how best to analyze PRO-CTCAE data longitudinally.
* PRO-CTCAE scores for each attribute (frequency, severity and/or interference) will be presented descriptively, Baseline, cycle 2 day 1 (approximately 29 days), and end of cycle 4 (approximately 16 weeks)
