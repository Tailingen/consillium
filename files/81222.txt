Mesothelioma Avastin Plus Pemetrexed-cisplatin Study
Our hypothesis is that the addition of bevacizumab to the standard chemotherapy treatment of MPM will improve overall survival and quality of life beyond that achieved with chemotherapy alone.

A phase II trial associating the reference chemotherapy (pemetrexed plus cisplatin) with bevacizumab is needed to ensure that no specific toxicity is induced by this association, and that this triplet have interesting activity. As pleural mesoth√©lioma is a rare tumor, a phase III trial, using the survival data from the phase II part study, will be able to include a sufficient number of patients, in a reasonable period of time, to answer the question of efficacy of the anti-angiogenic triplet, providing the efficacy outcomes could be considered as favorable, at the end of the phase II part of the study.
