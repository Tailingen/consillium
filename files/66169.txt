Chemoradiation for Bladder Preservation After Complete Response to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
Bladder preservation in patients with complete response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy will lead to equivalent or superior relapse free rates compared to cystectomy rates from historical controls.

PROCEDURE: Transurethral Resection of the Bladder Tumor & Cystoscopy|RADIATION: Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy|BEHAVIORAL: Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite Short Form 12|BEHAVIORAL: International Prostate Symptom Score
Rate of Failure-Free Survival With Intact Bladder (FFSIB) in Study Participants, Rate of failure free survival with intact bladder (FFSIB) at two years in subjects undergoing bladder preservation. FFSIB is defined by the absence of any failures (locoregional, distant metastasis, and death) and bladder preservation (no radical cystectomy for any causes) after definitive chemoradiation. FFSIB is defined as the time elapsed from the start of neoadjuvant chemotherapy to the date of documented failure events or radical cystectomy. For failure-free patients (without failure events and no radical cystectomy), FFSIB will be censored at the last date of documented failure-free bladder preservation (FFBP) status., 2 years
Rate of Failure-Free Survival (FFS) at Two Years, The two year rate of failure free survival (FFS) in study participants. This will include locoregional recurrence, and distant metastases. FFS is defined as absence of any failures (locoregional, distant metastasis, and death) during the time elapsed from the start of neoadjuvant chemotherapy to the date of documented failure events or radical cystectomy., 2 Years|Rate of Acute and Late Grade 2 or Higher Treatment-Related GU, GI and Hematologic Toxicity., The rate of acute and late grade 2 or higher (CTCAE v4.0) treatment-related genitourinary (GU), gastrointestinal (GI) and hematologic toxicity of bladder preservation in study participants., Up to 2 years Post-Treatment|Rate of Overall Survival in Study Participants, Rate of Overall Survival in Study Participants. Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time elapsed from the start of neoadjuvant chemotherapy until death. Surviving patients (including patients lost to follow up) will be censored at the date of last contact., Up to 3 years
Evaluation of Known Predictive and Prognostics Biomarkers for Complete Response to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy and Bladder Preservation., To evaluate known predictive and prognostic biomarkers for complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and bladder preservation. Blood, urine and tumor tissue will be collected pre- and post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy, post-cystectomy or chemoradiation, and at any time point of distant metastases., Up to 1 year Post-Treatment, About 2 years|Identification of New Predictive and Prognostic Biomarkers for Response to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy, and Bladder Preservation., To perform exploratory molecular analysis to identify new predictive and prognostic biomarkers for response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and bladder preservation. Blood, urine and tumor tissue for muscle invasive bladder cancer. Blood, urine and tumor tissue will be collected pre and post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy, post-cystectomy or chemoradiation, and at any time point of distant metastases., Up to 1 year Post-Treatment, About 2 years
1. Transurethral Resection of the Bladder Tumor (TURBT) and Cystoscopy performed by participating urologist:

   * cystoscopic evaluation
   * bimanual examination under anesthesia,
   * as thorough as possible a transurethral resection (TUR) of the bladder tumor,
   * and a biopsy of the prostatic urethra including both mucosa and stroma using a resection loop.
2. Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy, per standard of care: All patients will receive the neoadjuvant course of chemotherapy. The recommended neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen consists of Gemcitabine and Cisplatin given on a 21-day cycle.This regimen will begin within 8 weeks following the TURBT and cystoscopic evaluation by the urologic surgeon;
3. Post-Neoadjuvant Evaluation: This evaluation will take place â‰¤ 6 weeks following the completion of the neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Evaluation will include:

   * urine cytology,
   * cystoscopy,
   * tumor site transurethral biopsy,
   * and bimanual examination after biopsy
   * and biopsy of TURBT site
4. For subjects with complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy: Chemoradiation within 6 weeks after post-neoadjuvant evaluation. Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT/VMAT), and concurrent Cisplatin therapy, per standard of care; OR
5. For subjects with pT1 or worse tumor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy: Radical Cystectomy within 12 weeks after post-neoadjuvant evaluation;
6. Post-Consolidation Endoscopic Evaluations: The first post-treatment evaluation will be 30 days +/- 14 days within the end of chemoradiation, surgery or at progression. Subsequent cystoscopic evaluation will be every three months in the first year, every four months in the second year, and every six months in the third year (all evaluations to occur +/- 14 days). Each evaluation will include serum, plasma, whole blood, urine cytology.
