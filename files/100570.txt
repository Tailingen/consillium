Phase I/II Study of Decitabine and Valproic Acid in Relapsed/Refractory Leukemia or Myelodysplastic Syndromes
Valproic acid is a medication that is currently used in the prevention of seizures, bipolar disorder, and migraine headaches. Researchers hope that it may improve the effects of decitabine. Decitabine is a chemotherapy drug with known activity in leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes.
Leukemia|Myelodysplastic Syndromes
DRUG: Decitabine|DRUG: Valproic acid
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Valproic Acid + Decitabine, MTD is the dose level at which less than two participants develop a dose limiting toxicity (DLT). Response evaluated after completing first cycle, 4-8 weeks of therapy., Up to 8 weeks of therapy
Recent studies have shown synergy between demethylating agents and histone deacetylase inhibitors. It has been shown that both DNA methylation and histone deacetylation work together in affecting gene expression.

Therefore, drugs that inhibit DNA methylation and those that inhibit histone deacetylase can reactivate silenced genes in combination better than they can individually. Decitabine (5 aza-2'deoxycytidine), a drug that produces marked DNA hypomethylator, has demonstrated antileukemic activity at low doses. There are several drugs that have been shown to have histone acetylase activity. One of these is valproic acid that has been used safely for many years as an anti-seizure medication.
