Evaluation of Circulating Tumor Cells (CTC) Relevance in Breast Cancer Follow-up Using the ScreenCell Device
Liquid biopsy is a noninvasive method for detecting and quantifying circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Thanks to ScreenCell technology, this study aims to evaluate the evolution of the number of CTCs during breast cancer follow-up.

The identification and characterization of CTCs would make it possible to obtain information on the stage and molecular characteristics of cancer during follow-up

DEVICE: The DM/DIV ScreenCell is the experimental product studied during this research
Evolution of the kinetics of CTC during treatment, Evolution of the number of CTC isolated by ScreenCell technology thanks to a blood draw during the therapeutic management of metastatic and infiltrative non-metastatic breast cancer patients. Average number of CTCs measured during the study (D0, W6, W12, W24, W36), From enrollement to the end of follow up at 9 months
Molecular characterisation of CTC, Analysis of the expression of specific antigens and the presence of informative mutations on CTCs isolated by ScreenCell technology thanks to a blood draw during the therapeutic management of metastatic and infiltrative non-metastatic breast cancer patients during the study (D0, W6, W12, W24, W36), From enrollement to the end of follow up at 9 months
