Activity and Safety of Front-line Venetoclax and Rituximab in Young and Fit Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) is the gold treatment for fit and young patients with Chronic Lymphoid Leukemia (CLL). However, patients with a mutation known as IGVH unmutated and patients with a particular characteristic known as 'disrupted TP53' show an inferior outcome after FCR in terms of survival. Venetoclax as a single agent or combined with rituximab is an effective treatment for relapsed/refractory patients with IGVH unmutated CLL and/or del(17p) and is associated with a high rate of clinical responses.

Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) is the gold treatment for fit and young (age â‰¤65 years) patients with CLL. However, IGVH unmutated patients and patients with disrupted TP53 show an inferior outcome after FCR in terms of PFS and OS. Venetoclax as a single agent or combined with rituximab is an effective treatment for relapsed/refractory patients with IGVH unmutated CLL and/or del(17p) and is associated with a high rate of clinical responses and MRD-negative responses. The achievement of a MRD negative response in CLL is the best treatment endpoint since it is associated with an improved PFS.

In treatment-naive patients with unmutated IGVH and/or disrupted TP53 the venetoclax and rituximab combination could be a more effective regimen than FCR with a 15% increase in the CR rate.
