Habitat Escalated Adaptive Therapy (HEAT), With Neoadjuvant Radiation for Soft Tissue Sarcoma
The purpose of the study is to utilize radiomic images to precisely locate areas of tumor that can be treated with dose escalation radiation therapy.
High Grade Sarcoma
RADIATION: Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT)|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: MRI
Rate of Favorable Pathologic Response (FPR), Percentage of participants with Favorable Pathologic Response (FPR): tumor necrosis \>/= 95% at time of surgery. FPR is associated with improved R0 resection rates, local control, distant control, and overall survival. Therefore, FPR acts as an early surrogate for outcome., Week 10
Percentage of tumor with clear margin and positive margin, Review of final tumor margin of the surgical specimen, defined as tumor at ink margin, will be conducted by pathologist. A clear margin (R0) or a positive margin (R1/R2) will be designated, along with the location of the margin, which will be radiographically correlated to the habitat . Surgical margins are independent predictors for local control., Weeks 10-13
Disease Control Rate, Disease control rate defined as the sum of complete response, partial response, and stable disease rates., Up to 6 months|Overall Survival, Overall Survival defined as the time from date of initial treatment to date of death., Up to 8 months
The purpose of the study is to utilize radiomic images to precisely locate areas of tumor that can be treated with dose escalation radiation therapy.
