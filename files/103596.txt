Campath-1H Plus Rituximab for CD52- and CD20- Positive Refractory or Relapsed Chronic Lymphoid Disorders
The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if giving CAMPATH-1H with rituximab can shrink or slow the growth of the disease in patients with chronic lymphoid disorders that have either not responded or whose disease has returned after treatment with standard therapies.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
DRUG: Campath-1H|DRUG: Rituximab
Overall Response, Overall response categorized as 'Complete Remission,' 'Partial Remission,' or 'No Response.' Blood tests weekly while on active therapy, within 4-6 weeks following last dose of therapy, and every 3 to 6 (+/- month) thereafter as long as on study. Repeat bone marrow biopsy/aspirate with flow cytometry as applicable at the end of first course of therapy, (1 week) within 4-6 weeks following the last dose of therapy and every 6 to 12 months (+/-) thereafter as long as on study., After each 4 week course of treatment
Objectives:

1. To determine the efficacy and response rates of Campath-1H when given as a continuous intravenous infusion followed by subcutaneous injection plus rituximab in the treatment of chronic lymphoid disorders that are refractory to conventional therapy, have relapsed, or have no established frontline therapy.
2. To assess the safety of the combination of Campath-1H when given as a continuous intravenous infusion followed by subcutaneous injection plus rituximab in chronic lymphoid disorders that express both CD52 and CD20 cell surface antigens.
3. To measure levels of soluble (s) CD20 and sCD52 as well as levels of Campath-1H, rituximab and antibody complexes of rituximab/CD20 and Campath-1H/CD52 in patients with chronic lymphoid disorders treated with Campath-1H plus rituximab.
