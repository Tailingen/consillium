A Study of XMT-1660 in Solid Tumors
Triple Negative Breast Cancer|Breast Cancer|Endometrial Cancer|Ovarian Cancer|Fallopian Tube Cancer|Primary Peritoneal Cavity Cancer|Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma
DRUG: XMT-1660
Frequency of adverse events that are considered dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and associated with XMT-1660 during the first cycle of treatment (Dose Escalation), Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of XMT-1660, 17 months|Incidence of adverse events (Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion), Assess the safety and tolerability of XMT-1660 by determining the number of patients with adverse events from date of first dose to 30 days post last dose, 3 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR) (Dose Expansion), The percentage of patients with a best overall response of complete or partial response as assessed by the investigator per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, approximately 3 years
Objective Response Rate (ORR) (Dose Escalation), The percentage of patients with a best overall response of complete or partial response as assessed by the investigator per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, Up to approximately 3 years|Duration of response (DOR) (Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion), The time from when response criteria are first met until disease progression or death in participants who achieve a complete or partial response, Up to approximately 3 years|Time of maximum observed plasma concentration of XMT-1660 (Tmax) (Dose Expansion), Assess the pharmacokinetics of XMT-1660, 3 years|Maximum observed plasma concentration of XMT-1660 (Cmax) (Dose Expansion), Assess the pharmacokinetics of XMT-1660, 3 years|Area under the concentration-time curve of XMT-1660 (AUC) (Dose Expansion), Assess the pharmacokinetics of XMT-1660, 3 years|Systemic clearance of XMT-1660 (Dose Expansion), Assess the pharmacokinetics of XMT-1660 by measuring the rate at which the drug is eliminated from the body, 3 years|Apparent terminal elimination half-life of XMT-1660 (Dose Expansion), Assess the pharmacokinetics of XMT-1660, 3 years|Volume of Distribution (Dose Expansion), Assess the pharmacokinetics of XMT-1660, 3 years|Trough concentration of XMT-1660 (Ctrough) (Dose Expansion), Assess the pharmacokinetics of XMT-1660 by measuring the lowest concentration of drug before dosing, 3 years|Assess antidrug antibodies (ADA) and neutralizing antibodies (nAB) (Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion), Assess the development of antidrug antibodies (ADA) and neutralizing antibodies (nAb) to XMT-1660, 3 years
This first-in-human (FIH) study will test the safety and side effects of a drug called XMT-1660. A side effect is anything a drug does to the body besides treating the disease.

Participants in the study will have cancer that has come back after a period of time during which the cancer could not be detected (recurrent), spread in the body near where it started (advanced) or spread through the body (metastatic).

The study will have two parts. The first part called Dose Escalation will find out how much XMT-1660 should be given to participants. The second part called Dose Expansion will use the dose found in the first part to find out how safe XMT-1660 is and if it works to treat solid tumor cancers.
