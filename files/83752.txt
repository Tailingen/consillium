A Study of SY-5933 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors Harboring the KRAS p.G12C Mutation
This is a single-arm, open-label, phase 1 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and anti-tumor activity of SY-5933 in patients with KRAS p.G12C mutant advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: SY-5933
Incidence of Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), Number of participants with DLTs, 31 days after the first dose (single dose for 3 days and dose-escalation cycle 1 for 28 days)|Number of participants with adverse events, Patients will be assessed for incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) according to NCI-CTCAE v5.0 criteria, Up to 18 months
Pharmacokinetics (Cmax) for SY-5933, Defined as maximum observed plasma concentration, Protocol-defined time points during 3 days after the first dose and cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Pharmacokinetics (Tmax) for SY-5933, Defined as time to maximum plasma concentration, Protocol-defined time points during 3 days after the first dose and cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Pharmacokinetics (AUC0-t) for SY-5933, Defined as area under the single-dose plasma concentration-time curve from Hour 0 to the last quantifiable measurable plasma concentration, Protocol-defined time points during 3 days after the first dose and cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Pharmacokinetics (tÂ½) for SY-5933, Defined as the apparent plasma terminal phase disposition half-life, Protocol-defined time points during 3 days after the first dose and cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Overall Response Rate (ORR) as assessed by RECIST 1.1 criteria, Preliminary measure of anti-tumor activity of SY-5933 in patients with KRAS p.G12C mutant advanced tumor, Up to 24 months|Disease control rate (DCR) as assessed by RECIST 1.1 criteria, Preliminary measure of anti-tumor activity of SY-5933 in patients with KRAS p.G12C mutant advanced tumor, Up to 24 months|Duration of response (DOR), Preliminary measure of anti-tumor activity of SY-5933 in patients with KRAS p.G12C mutant advanced tumor, Up to 24 months
The study will be conducted in 2 parts: Part 1 - Dose Escalation and Part 2 - Dose Expansion. Part 1 is aimed at evaluating the safety, tolerability, PK and pharmacodynamics of SY-5933 and determining the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of repeat daily (QD) dosing schedule in subjects with advanced KRAS p.G12C mutant solid tumors using accelerated titration and 3+3 design. The dose escalation part of the study will consist of 7-13 subjects and the dose expansion part will consist of 30-60 additional subjects, comprising 2 cohorts. Cohort A includes patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring KRAS p.G12C mutations and Cohort B includes patients with other advanced solid tumors (colorectal, pancreatic cancers, etc.). Patients in dose expansion study will receive SY-5933 tablets QD, oral administration, 28 days as a dosing cycle, to further evaluate the safety, PK profile, and efficacy of SY-5933, and to further define RP2D. Administration of SY-5933 may continue until evidence of disease progression, intolerance to SY-5933, or withdrawal of consent.
