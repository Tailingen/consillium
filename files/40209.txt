Patients will participate in training in AMMA use and will be asked to bring the device to the chemotherapy infusion center for use during each chemotherapy treatment visit. The device will be used for 30 minutes prior to the start of chemotherapy, during chemotherapy and for 2 hours after chemotherapy. Scalp photos will be obtained at baseline and after the last chemotherapy treatment. Patients will be asked to complete the following questionnaires: training evaluation after training is complete; and symptoms from device use, experience with device use and self-assessment of hair loss after each chemotherapy treatment.
