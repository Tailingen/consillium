Anti-GD2 CAR T Cells in Pediatric Patients Affected by High Risk and/or Relapsed/Refractory Neuroblastoma or Other GD2-positive Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of GD2-CART01, a CAR T cell treatment targeting GD2 in paediatric or young adult patients with High Risk and/or relapsed/refractory Neuroblastoma.

A small exploratory cohort of patients with GD2-positive tumors other than Neuroblastoma has also been included.
Neuroblastoma|Neuroblastoma Recurrent|GD2-positive Solid Tumors|Osteosarcoma|Ewing Sarcoma|Sarcoma
BIOLOGICAL: GD2-CART01
Phase I - Identification of the dose limiting toxicity (DLT), Toxicity will be assessed according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) scale, version 4 and the number of patients experiencing DLT will be evaluated, 4 weeks after T cell infusion|Phase II - Antitumor effect, Assessment of Best Overall Response (BOR), Up to 6 months after T cell infusion
In vivo persistence/expansion of infused CAR T cell, Detection of infused CAR T cell in the peripheral and bone marrow blood, UP to 5 years|Serum cytokine profiling, Assessment of the seric cytokines profile, First 2 weeks after T cell infusion|Time To Progression (TTP), Up 5 years after T cell infusion|Event-Free Survival (EFS), Up 5 years after T cell infusion|Overall Survival (OS), Up 5 years after T cell infusion|Disease outcome according to INRC vs irRC, Tumor response assessment through the two different criteria, Up to 5 years|Elimination of CAR T cell through iC9 in case of toxicity, Assessment of the kinetic of CAR T cell elimination after infusion of the dimerizer, Up to 15 years
The study will consist of 2 phases, a Phase I or dose escalation phase and a Phase II or expansion phase. Paediatric or young adult patients with relapsed High Risk and/or relapsed/refractory Neuroblastoma will be enrolled in the study.

After completion of the phase I portion of the study, a small cohort of patients with GD2-positive tumors other than Neuroblastoma has also been included.

Eligible patients will undergo leukapheresis in order to harvest T cells, which will be manufactured to obtain the autologous CAR T product GD2-CART01, a GD2-targeting CAR T product. Briefly, the patients will be treated with a lymphodepleting regimen containing conventional chemotherapic agents and subsequently will receive a single infusion of GD2-CART01. Moreover, the product contains a suicide gene safety switch (namely inducible Caspase 9): in case of relevant toxicities, the patient will receive the dimerizing agent in order to activate the apoptotic pathway in the infused T cells.

After infusion of CAR T cells, the patients will enter a 5-year active follow-up period.
