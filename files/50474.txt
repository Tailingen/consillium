Laboratory Study of Cancer & Immune Cells in Ascites Fluid of Ovarian Cancer Patients to Test Alternative Therapies
Ascites samples from women undergoing surgery for ovarian cancer will be collected for use in translational research.
Ovarian Cancer
Collect ascites fluid obtained from ovarian cancer patients during cytoreductive surgery or paracentesis, To elucidate the conditions of the tumor environment that contribute to cancer dissemination in the peritoneal cavity through ex vivo evaluation of malignant ascites collected from women with ovarian, tubal, or primary peritoneal cancer., 5 years
To correlate specific features of peritoneal cell populations or soluble factors with patient outcome., To correlate specific features of peritoneal cell populations or soluble factors with patient outcome., 5 years
The purpose of this study is to collect ascites fluid obtained from ovarian cancer patients during cytoreductive surgery or paracentesis at the University of New Mexico Hospital or Cancer Center. Cancer cells and immune cells from the ascites fluid will be used to test novel immunotherapies for ovarian cancer treatment and to establish patient derived xenograft models to perform preclinical testing on a cancer cell population that better models the heterogeneity in patient disease
