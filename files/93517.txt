Almonertinib as Upfront Treatment for Uncommon EGFR Mutation Harboring Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Patients: A Multicenter, Open-Label, Phase II Trial
This is a Phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy and the safety/ tolerability of Almonertinib in NSCLC patients with uncommon EGFR Mutation or EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations. Patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations have to had at least one prior systemic treatment for locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Almonertinib
Objective Response Rate, The proportion of subjects who achieve Complete Response (CR) and Partial Response (PR) by the best response from the first dose of Almonertinib to the end of study., To evaluate objective response rate 6-8 weeks after the initiation of Almonertinib
Progression Free Survival, The PFS time is defined as time from enrollment to locoregional or systemic recurrence, second malignancy or death due to any cause; censored observations will be the last date of : "death", "last tumor assessment", "last follow up date" or "last date in drug log", 30 months|Disease Control Rate, Disease Control Rate (DCR) defined as the percentage of participants with Disease Control best overall response (complete response, partial response or stable disease)., 30 months|Overall Survival, OS was defined as time from date of enrollment to date of death due to any cause. For participants still alive at the time of analysis, OS time was censored on last date that participants were known to be alive., 30 months|Duration of Response, Number of days from the date that measurement criteria are first met for CR or PR (whichever status is recorded first) until the first subsequent date that progressive disease or death is documented., 30 months|Safety and Tolerability, Number of Participants with treatment related Adverse Events as Assessed by CTCAE v5.0, 30 months
