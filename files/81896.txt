Prior to any assessments, all subjects must provide a signed ICF. Prior to inclusion in the program, the patients must undergo all appropriate screening procedures to check for eligibility.

Once eligibility is confirmed, patients will receive treatment with surufatinib 300mg, orally (PO), daily (QD). All patients will undergo continuous monitoring for safety until the end of treatment.

There is no pre-defined duration of treatment for each patient. Patients will be treated until progressive disease (as defined by treating physician), unacceptable toxicity, death, withdrawal from program, the treatment becomes commercially available, or halting of product development.

A follow-up clinic visit is recommended for all patients approximately 30 days after last dose of treatment to complete the final safety assessments, as applicable.
