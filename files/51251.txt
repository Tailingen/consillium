Chemo-immunotherapy Using Ibrutinib Plus Indoximod for Patients With Pediatric Brain Cancer
Recent lab-based discoveries suggest that IDO (indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase) and BTK (Bruton's tyrosine Kinase) form a closely linked metabolic checkpoint in tumor-associated antigen-presenting cells. The central clinical hypothesis for the GCC2020 study is that combining ibrutinib (BTK-inhibitor) with indoximod (IDO-inhibitor) during chemotherapy will synergistically enhance anti-tumor immune responses, leading to improvement in clinical response with manageable overlapping toxicity.

GCC2020 is a prospective open-label phase 1 trial to determine the best safe dose of ibrutinib to use in combination with a previously studied chemo-immunotherapy regimen, comprised of the IDO-inhibitor indoximod plus oral metronomic cyclophosphamide and etoposide (4-drug combination) for participants, age 6 to 25 years, with relapsed or refractory primary brain cancer. Those previously treated with indoximod plus temozolomide may be eligible, including prior treatment via the phase 2 indoximod study (GCC1949, NCT04049669), the now closed phase 1 study (NLG2105, NCT02502708), or any expanded access (compassionate use) protocols. A dose-escalation cohort will determine the best safe dose of ibrutinib for the 4-drug combination. This will be followed by an expansion cohort, using ibrutinib at the best safe dose in the 4-drug combination, to allow assessment of preliminary evidence of efficacy.
