The Effect of Remote Ischemic Preconditioning on Kidney Function in Patients Undergoing Partial Nephrectomy
This study is intended to evaluate the renal protective effect of Remote Ischemic Preconditioning (RIPC) in patients undergoing partial nephrectomy. Half of the enrolled subjects will receive 4 cycles of brief ischemia on the upper arm after anesthesia induction and prior to the surgery, while the other half will not receive this treatment as a control group.

Remote Ischemic Preconditioning (RIPC) is the concept of mitigating ischemia-reperfusion injury to target organs by a brief episode of ischemia-reperfusion of the limb. The protective effect of RIPC on major organs has been demonstrated in an animal study, but its clinical efficacy has not yet been established.

The kidney is a typical organ vulnerable to ischemic injury, and the renal protective effect of RIPC can be expected. There have been many reports of renal protective effects of RIPC in cardiac and vascular surgery. On the other hand, few studies have investigated the effect of RIPC during partial nephrectomy in which ischemia-reperfusion injury can occur during the surgery.

In this study, the investigators will evaluate the effect of RIPC in patients undergoing partial nephrectomy to prevent renal impairment and improve the prognosis after the surgery.
