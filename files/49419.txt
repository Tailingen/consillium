Real World Evidence for the Cycle of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Gastric Cancer With Shared Decision Making
The purpose of the study is to evaluate the maximal cycle of effective neoadjuvant chemotherapy for resectable gastric cancer, to determine what is the best cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for the patients who receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

DRUG: NACT|PROCEDURE: SDM|PROCEDURE: Surgery|DRUG: ACT|OTHER: Questionnaire
The cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, The cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy means the maximal cycle of effective neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The effective means no disease progress by image diagnosis, 18months
The clinical response rate, The clinical response is evaluated by CT/MRI according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST)1.1, 18 months|The completion rate of perioperative chemotherapy, The completion rate of perioperative chemotherapy means the patient completed the 8 cycles of perioperative chemotherapy as planned (n cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and 8-n cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy), 18 months|The progressive disease rate, The progressive disease during neoadjuvant chemotherapy with shared decision making is is evaluated by CT/MRI according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST)1.1, 18 months|The pathological response, The pathological response during neoadjuvant chemotherapy with shared decision making is evaluated according to the tumor regression grade of NCCN guideline., 18 months|The pathological complete response, The pathological complete response is defined as ypT0N0M0, 18months|The adverse event of chemotherapy, The adverse event of chemotherapy is evaluated and recorded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v.3, 18 months|Surgical morbidity, Surgical morbidity is defined as the events which occurs with-in postoperative 30 days, extension of hospitalization and re-hospitalization. It is necessary to evaluate the complication and if it occurs during the hospitalization, it is required to record complication name, date of on-set (postoperatively), grade on Clavien-Dindo Classification and treatment for complication., 18 months|The 3-year progression-free survival, In terms of locally advanced gastric cancer, to evaluate the progression-free survival rate in gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection at postoperative 3 years, 48months|The cTNM,ycTNM,ypTNM stage, The cTNM stage, ycTNM stage and ypTNM stage is defined according to the 8th TNM stage., 60months|The decisional conflicts, The decisional conflicts is evaluated by Decisional Conflict Scale, 12months|The decisional regrets, The decisional regrets is evaluated by Decision Regret Scale, 12months|The involvement of patients during the shared decision making, The involvement of patients during the shared decision making is evaluated by MAPPIN'SDM questionnaire, 12months
The study is a non-randomized clinical trial. The protocol has been approved by the Ethics Committee of Beijing Cancer Hospital. MRI and enhanced CT are used to evaluate the clinical response of the tumor. The primary endpoint is the maximal cycle of effective neoadjuvant chemotherapy for resectable gastric cancer.
