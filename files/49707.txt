TK-based Suicide Gene Therapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to determine whether activation of a prodrug after intratumoral gene transfer is safe in humans, and to determine dose levels for further clinical development.
Carcinoma, Hepatocellular
GENETIC: TK99UN
Adverse Events, Daily for the first 16 day, monthly thereafter for 6 months, 3-monthly since then
Tumor response by WHO criteria, at day 63 and months 4, 6, 9 y 12
The study is a phase I clinical trial evaluating the intratumoral injection of defective adenovirus containing HSVtk (the thymidine kinase of herpes simplex virus), in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma that were not amenable to curative therapy. The study was conducted in a single center in Spain. Five consecutive cohorts of two patients received increasing doses of the vector by intratumoral injection and equal doses of either intravenous ganciclovir or oral valganciclovir. The dose received by each consecutive cohort of patients was progressively higher according to a prefixed scale.
