LS301-IT in Partial Mastectomy and Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB) for DCIS or Stage I-II Primary Invasive Breast Cancer
The aim of this Phase 1b/2 study is to investigate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single dose of LS301-IT, a novel fluorescence imaging agent developed by Integro Theranostics (IT), administered by intravenous (IV) injection in female patients undergoing partial mastectomy for DCIS (whether or not undergoing planned SLNB) or Stage I-II primary invasive breast cancer undergoing SLNB. Safety is the primary objective of this study, followed by efficacy that will be assessed from fluorescence imaging observations and data.

This is a Phase 1b/Phase 2, open-label study to investigate the use of LS301-IT (investigational medicinal product \[IMP\]), a fluorescence imaging agent used for visualization of tumor margins and SLNs in female patients with DCIS or Stage I-II, primary invasive carcinoma of the breast, for which the patient's primary surgical treatment is partial mastectomy.

Eligible patients will be enrolled into either:

* Phase 1b (Period 1): dose finding (escalation/de-escalation), and dose timing adjustment;
* Phase 2a (Period 2): expanded sample size based on acceptable dosing regimen, that being the dose level(s) and time interval between LS301-IT injection and surgery, determined in Period 1; or
* Period 2b (Period 3): allow surgeon to make additional surgical decisions based on fluorescence imaging findings during surgery (Period 3 will not be opened until results are available from Periods 1 and 2 and further FDA consultation is obtained).
