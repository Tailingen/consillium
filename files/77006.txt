Neoadjuvant Immune Checkpoint Blockade in Resectable Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma
The proposed study will evaluate the safety and feasibility of neoadjuvant nivolumab +/- ipilimumab in resectable MPM. In addition, maintenance nivolumab will be administered for 1 year following completion of standard bi-/tri-modality therapy.

Safety Profile of neoadjuvant nivolumab +/- ipilimumab in patients with resectable malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) with grade III/IV adverse events defined by CTCAE v5.0, Number of participants with grade III/IV adverse events defined by CTCAE v5.0, occurring within 100 days of last study drug administration or 30 days post-surgery (whichever is longer)., up to 5 years|Feasibility of neoadjuvant nivolumab +/- ipilimumab in patients with resectable MPM who complete of neoadjuvant treatment and proceed to surgery, Feasibility as measured by the number of participants who complete of neoadjuvant treatment with nivolumab +/- ipilimumab and proceed to surgery without extended treatment-related delay (\>24 days from preplanned surgery date)., up to 5 years
Pathological Response to neoadjuvant nivolumab +/- ipilimumab in resected tumor and lymph nodes in patients with resectable MPM defined as ≤10% residual viable tumor cells and pathologic complete response, Number of participants with pathologic response, defined as ≤10% residual viable tumor cells in the resection specimen, and pathologic complete response (no residual viable tumor cells in the resection specimen)., 5 years|Radiographic Response to neoadjuvant nivolumab +/- ipilimumab utilizing RECIST 1.1, Number of participants with radiographic response as determined utilizing RECIST 1.1, modified RECIST for pleural tumors, and change in FDG avidity on PET/CT pre- and post-treatment., 5 years|Toxicity as assessed by number of participants experienced grade III/IV adverse events as defined by CTCAE v5.0 within 100 days of last study drug administration, Toxicity as assessed by number of participants experienced grade III/IV adverse events as defined by CTCAE v5.0 within 100 days of last study drug administration, up to 100 days post-intervention
For Arm A 15 patients with resectable MPM will be enrolled and receive preoperative nivolumab, 240mg IV, on Day -42, -28 and Day -14 (+/- two days for each timepoint) prior to planned surgery on Day 0 (to allow for scheduling surgery may take place between Day -3 and Day +10).

Subsequent to full accrual to Arm A, 15 patients with resectable MPM will be enrolled and receive preoperative nivolumab, 3mg/kg IV, on Day -42, -28 and Day -14 (+/- two days for each timepoint) + ipilimumab 1mg/kg IV on Day -42 prior to planned surgery on Day 0 (to allow for scheduling surgery may take place between Day -3 and Day +10).
