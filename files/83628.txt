Study of Selumetinib (AZD6244)(ARRY-142886) in Combination With Irinotecan in Previously Treated Patients With Colorec
The purpose of this study is to determine whether treatment with Selumetinib (AZD6244) (Hyd-Sulfate) in combination with Irinotecan as a second treatment in patients with K-ras or B-raf mutation will prevent tumor progression and prolong progression free survival.
Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: AZD6244|DRUG: Irinotecan
Dose Finding will be calculated based upon toxicity screening and dose modification guidelines within protocol., AEs will be assessed at each cycle visit, discontinuation treatment visit, and 30 days post last day of study treatment|Objective Response Rate will be assessed by the RECIST guideline documented in the European Journal of Cancer, 2009., Tumor evaluation via RECIST guidelines will be done on screening visit, day 22 of every other cycle, and treatment discontinuation visit
Safety of combination of Selumetinib (AZD6244) with irinotecan by SAE and AE documentation, AEs will be assesed at the screening visit, each cycle visit, treatment discontinuation date, and 30 days post last day of study treatment|PK of Selumetinib (AZD6244), N-desmethyl Selumetinib(AZD6244) and selumetinib (AZD6244) amide in combination with irinotecan, PK sample draws will take place on Day 1 and 15 of first cycle|Progression Free Survival (PFS) for patients with K-ras or B-raf mutations treated with combination of irinotecan and Selumetinib (AZD6244), PFS will be determined via the RECIST guidelines on tumor measurement done on day 22 of every other cycle and on the treatment discontinuation visit
