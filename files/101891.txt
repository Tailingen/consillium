This phase II study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of S-1 plus Abraxane as second-line treatment for cholangiocarcinoma.
Cholangiocarcinoma
DRUG: S-1 plus Abraxane
Response rates, 6 months
Progression-free survival, 6 months|Number of participants with adverse events, Adverse events evaluated by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0., 12 months
There are no standard second-line treatment for cholangiocarcinoma, new therapies are needed. The efficacy of S-1 as first-line treatment for cholangiocarcinoma was confirmed in several studies. The IMPACT study showed that Abraxane plus gemcitabine provide better survival than gemcitabine alone. Since cholangiocarcinoma displayed similar sensitivity to chemotherapy which was used in pancreatic carcinoma, we assume that S-1 plus Abraxane is effective and safe in treating cholangiocarcinoma.
