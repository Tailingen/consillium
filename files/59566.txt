Enfortumab Vedotin and Stereotactic Radiation for Localized, Cisplatin Ineligible Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer
STAR-EV will evaluate the combination of enfortumab vedotin plus radiotherapy (RT) as neoadjuvant treatment for muscle invasive bladder cancer prior to radical cystectomy surgery. The study will use "dose escalation" to evaluate the safety and efficacy of study treatment at three dose regimens:

Level 0: EV treatment followed by RT to the bladder Level 1: EV treatment with RT starting on Cycle 2, Day 15 Level 2: EV treatment with RT starting on Cycle 1, Day 15

Following completion of EV+RT neoadjuvant therapy, all subjects will undergo surgery as part of routine care.
Bladder Cancer
DRUG: Enfortumab vedotin
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) Regimen, A standard 3 + 3 dose escalation schedule will be used for all escalations. Enfortumab Vedotin will be given for three 21 day cycles. Radiation therapy will be administered at dose level 0, level 1 or level 2., From initiation of Enfortuman Vedotin treatment until post neoadjuvant therapy visit (approximately 120 days)|Pathologic Complete response rate at radical cystectomy, Rate of complete pathologic response in bladder tumor biopsy at cystectomy according to postsurgical staging., At radical cystectomy following completion of neoadjuvant therapy (approximately 6 weeks after completion of EV treatment)
Adverse Events, Adverse events reported and observed according to CTCAE v5.0, From initiation of neoadjuvant therapy to completion of final post treatment study visit (approximately 4 months)|Rate of pathologic downstaging in the bladder, Rate of post surgical pathologic staging being less than clinical staging., At radical cystectomy following completion of neoadjuvant therapy (approximately 6 weeks after completion of EV treatment)
STAR EV is a phase I/II trial with safety lead in, designed to assess safety and preliminary efficacy signal in improving pathologic complete response by adding stereotactic radiation to neoadjuvant enfortumab vedotin. Participants will be adult patients with urothelial predominant bladder cancer ineligible for neoadjuvant cisplatin-based therapy (based on provider assessment) and planned for radical cystectomy.

All participants will undergo the same treatment:

* Enfortumab vedotin (PADCEV) 1.25mg/kg (max 125mg) IV Day 1, 8 q21 day cycle x 3 cycles
* Radiation: Stereotactic radiotherapy to bladder (partial bladder volume preferred) 5 fractions; either sequential to EV treatment or concurrent with EV treatment
* Surgery: Standard of care radical cystectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection with urinary diversion per surgeon discretion.

The study will use a patient safety lead-in incorporating escalation of EV-RT from sequential to concurrent use with pre-defined stopping rules according to treatment-related adverse event (TRAE) rate of grade 3 or above. Primary endpoints are related to safety (maximum tolerated dose "regimen" based on dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) observed) and pathologic complete response rate at the time of surgery. Subjects will be followed for one year following cystectomy, or completion of neoadjuvant therapy for any subject who does not undergo cystectomy for any reason.
