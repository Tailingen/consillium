EON: A Single-arm Phase II Study of Etigilimab (OMP-313M32) in Combination With Checkpoint Inhibition (Nivolumab) in Patients With Platinum-resistant, Recurrent Epithelial Ovarian Cancer
To learn if adding etigilimab to nivolumab therapy can help to control clear cell ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers that are resistant to platinum-based therapy
Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: Etigilimab
Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, through study completion; an average of 1 year.
Primary Objectives:

1. To estimate the objective response rate of the combination of etigilimab and nivolumab in patients with platinum resistant clear cell ovarian cancer.
2. To evaluate the toxicity of the combination of etigilimab and nivolumab in patients with platinum resistant clear cell ovarian cancer.

Secondary Objectives:

1. To determine PFS of the combination of etigilimab and nivolumab in patients with platinum resistant clear cell ovarian cancer.
2. To estimate the disease control rate of the combination of etigilimab and nivolumab in patients with platinum resistant clear cell ovarian cancer.
3. To investigate molecular and immunological changes associated with the combination of TIGIT and PD-1 inhibition; specifically to describe changes in T cell populations (including but not limited to CD3, CD8, CD4, FOXP3) and cell proliferation, as well as report changes in the proportion of macrophage phenotypes M1 and M2 (with phenotypic markers potentially including arginase1, CD11b, PDL-1, and CD206)
4. To determine feasibility of interrogating the gut microbial signatures and dietary patterns in an ovarian cancer cohort.
5. Identify components and determinants of the gut microbiome that could modulate toxicity or provide a signature of excellent or poor response to cancer immunotherapy.
