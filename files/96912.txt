PD-1 Antibody and Radiotherapy for Recurrent Cervical Cancer
This study is to investigate retrospectively the effects of combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors anti-programmed death-1 antibody (PD-1 antibody) and radiotherapy for recurrent, metastatic and persistent advanced cervical carcinomas. Patients may or may not accept PD-1 antibody as maintenance therapy. Patients are followed up and the survival outcomes are evaluated. The primary endpoint are objective remission rate. The secondary endpoints are progression-free survival, overall survival and severe adverse events.
