INCMGA00012 in Combination With Other Therapies in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, preliminary evidence of clinical activity, and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of INCMGA00012 in combination with other agents that may improve the therapeutic efficacy of anti-PD-1 monotherapy.
