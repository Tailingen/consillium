APG-115 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors or Lymphomas
APG-115 is a novel, orally active small-molecule mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2) inhibitor. Mechanistically, APG-115 increases p53 and p21 overexpression, activates p53 - mediated apoptosis in tumor cells retaining wild-type p53. APG-115 has shown strong dose- and schedule-dependent antitumor activities in multiple human cancer xenograft and a patient derived xenograft (PDX) models. The preclinical data generated from APG-115 suggest that it may have a broad therapeutic potential for the treatment of human cancer as a single agent and in combination with other classes of anticancer drugs. APG-115 is intended for the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors and lymphomas. Upon completion of the Phase 1 dose escalation study to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), and/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), several phase Ib/II studies will be implemented accordingly.
