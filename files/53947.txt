A Trial of a Botanical Drug Containing East Indian Sandalwood Oil (EISO) for Treatment of Common Warts
Nonclinical studies have shown sandalwood oil to have anti-inflammatory, anti-fungal, antiviral, and anti-bacterial activities. Previous clinical studies have shown East Indian Sandalwood oil to be promising as a treatment for common warts in adults and children.

The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 10%, 20%, and 30% East Indian Sandalwood Oil (EISO) ointment compared with the ointment placebo administered twice daily (bid) for 12 weeks for the treatment of common warts (Verruca vulgaris).

Complete Resolution of All Treated Warts by or at Week 12, During the Treatment Period, subjects will apply study medication to all warts in the treatment area for 12 weeks and will then be followed for an additional 12 weeks. Subjects achieving complete resolution will continue to apply the study medication for the entire 12-week treatment period. During the Follow-up Period, subjects will be followed by telephone every 4 weeks for 12 weeks. Clinical evaluations, including wart counts, wart measurements and recording of adverse events and concomitant medications will be performed. Photographs of the treatment area will be taken at all study visits, 12 weeks
