3D Ultrasound Microvessel Imaging for Breast Masses
This early phase I trial studies how well 3D ultrasound microvessel imaging works for the diagnosis of breast mass. The 3D ultrasound microvessel imaging technology demonstrates significantly increased vessel detection sensitivity over conventional doppler methods without the need of using contrast agents. This study may improve cancer diagnosis and reduce unnecessary biopsy on benign tumors.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Optimization of imaging protocol for this new ultrasound technology. II. Investigate the diagnostic performance of the new ultrasound technology using clinically indicated biopsy as the reference standard.

OUTLINE:

Patients undergo 3 dimensional (D) ultrasound microvessel imaging over 45 minutes. Patients' medical records are reviewed.
