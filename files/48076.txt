This Phase I/II study will be conducted according to a multicenter, open-label design. At least 20 patients will receive the vaccine as first-line and at least 20 as second-line treatment. The treatment will comprise a maximum of 18 injections of dHER2 vaccine. Follow-up phase: This will commence with the end-of-treatment examination, followed by examinations three months, six months and twelve months after the last study vaccination. The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.
