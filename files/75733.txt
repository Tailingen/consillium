A Study Evaluating Safety, Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, And Clinical Activity Of RO7119929 (TLR7 Agonist) In Participants With Unresectable Advanced Or Metastatic Hepatocellular Carcinoma, Biliary Tract Cancer, Or Solid Tumors With Hepatic Metastases
Phase I study of RO7119929 given orally to participants with unresectable advanced or metastatic primary liver cancers and other solid tumors with predominant liver involvement. The primary objective of the study is to explore the safety and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or optimal biologic dose (OBD) of RO7119929 as single agent.

Number of Participants With Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLT), A DLT is defined as a clinically significant AE (classified according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events \[NCI CTCAE\] v.5.0) or significant laboratory abnormality 1) occurring during an assessment period of 21 days or 28 days after first dose of study treatment, respectively, and 2) is not attributed to disease progression, concomitant illness or another clearly identifiable cause., Baseline up to approximately 14 months|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) According To NCI CTCAE v5.0, An Adverse Event is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment., Baseline up to approximately 14 months
