Radiation-Induced Cytokine Cascades and Their Correlation With Central Nervous System Injury
Treatment for brain cancer may include radiation therapy. Radiation therapy is the treatment of tumors with X-rays. This study is related to understanding the side effects of radiation treatment for brain tumors.

This study is being conducted by the University of Rochester Cancer Center to compare the extent of side effects of brain cancer treatment with changes in levels of blood proteins called cytokines.
