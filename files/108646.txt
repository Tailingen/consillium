A Phase I Trial of CCT303-406 in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory HER2 Positive Solid Tumors
This clinical study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of CCT303-406 CAR modified autologous T cells (CCT303-406) in subjects with relapsed or refractory stage IV metastatic HER2-positive solid tumors.
Solid Tumor|Gastric Cancer|Breast Cancer|Ovarian Cancer|Sarcoma
BIOLOGICAL: CCT303-406
MTD: to determine the maximum tolerated dose of CCT303-406, To assess the DLT (dose limiting toxicities) attributed to CCT303-406 per cohort and determine the RP2D (recommended phase 2 dose)., 28 days following infusion
ORR (overall response rate): Proportion of subjects with the best overall response (BOR), Best overall response (BOR) of subjects with PR (partial response) and CR (complete response) as determined by local investigator using RECIST 1.1, Up to 52 weeks|12 month survival rate, The proportion of living subjects within 52 weeks of infusion, Up to 52 weeks|DCR: Disease control rate, The proportion of subjects with CR (complete response), PR (partial response) or SD (stable disease lasting over 6 months) as determined by local investigator using RECIST 1.1., Up to 52 weeks|DOR: Duration of reponse, The duration of time from record of response to first progression of disease as determined by RECIST 1.1 or death date not relevant to disease progression, Up to 52 weeks|PFS: Progression free survival, The time of disease progression by RECIST 1.1 or death since cell infusion, Up to 52 weeks|AE: Adverse Events, The incidence, severity and duration of AE, TEAE and SAE as determined by NCI-CTCAE v5.0, Up to 52 weeks|The expansion over time of genetically modified CCT303-406 cells in the peripheral blood as determined by QPCR (copies/ug gDNA), PK: Pharmacokinetics, Up to 52 weeks|The persistence over time of genetically modified CCT303-406 cells in the peripheral blood as determined by Flow Cytometry (% CAR + cells), PK: Pharmacokinetics, Up to 52 weeks
Exploration of target-efficacy correlation, The correlation between levels of HER2 expression and ORR, Up to 52 weeks
This is a single arm, open label, dose escalation clinical study to evaluate the safety and preliminary therapeutic efficacy of CCT303-406 cells in adult subjects with HER2 positive relapsed or refractory stage IV metastatic solid tumors.

Subjects that meet inclusion criteria with positive biopsy HER2 (IHC 3+ in â‰¥50% tumor cells) will receive CCT303-406 according to the 3+3 dose escalation design.
