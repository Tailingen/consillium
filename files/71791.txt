A Phase I/Ib Study of NZV930 Alone and in Combination With PDR001 and /or NIR178 in Patients With Advanced Malignancies.
The purpose of this study was to assess the safety, tolerability, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of experimental medication NZV930 alone and when combined with PDR001 and/or NIR178, in patients with advanced cancers
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)|Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC)|Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC)|Colorectal Cancer Microsatellite Stable (MSS)|Ovarian Cancer|Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)|Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC)
OTHER: NZV930|OTHER: PDR001|DRUG: NIR178
Number of participants with adverse events as a measure of safety and tolerability of the NZV930 in combination with PDR001 and/or NIR178, Incidence and severity of AEs and SAEs, incl. changes in laboratory parameters, vital signs, and ECGs Dose limiting toxicity in cycle 1 (28 days) for single agent NZV930 and NZV930 in combination with PDR001 and/or NIR178 during dose escalation phase only Tolerability: dose interruptions Tolerability: dose reductions Tolerability: dose intensity, 3 years
Overall response rate (ORR), Defined as the proportion of patients with best overall response of CR or PR, 3 years|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), Defined as the proportion of patients with best overall response of CR, PR or SD \>= 16 weeks, 3 years|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Defined as the time from the date of start of treatment to the date of the event defined as first documented progression or death due to any cause, 3 years|Serum concentration vs. time profiles of NZV930 (free drug) and PDR001., Serum concentration vs. time profiles of NZV930 (free drug) and PDR001., 3 years|Plasma concentration vs. time profiles for NIR178 and derived PK parameters, Concentration time profile of NIR178 and its metabolites, 3 years|To assess the immunogenicity of NZV930 and PDR001, Presence and titer of anti-drug antibodies, anti-NZV930 and anti-PDR001 in (patients receiving combination with PDR001)., 3 years
