A Phase II Non-Controlled, Open-Label, Efficacy, Safety, Pharmacokinetic, and Pharmacodynamic Study of Pacritinib in Myelofibrosis
To evaluate the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of pacritinib in Asian subjects with myelofibrosis (MF), which includes primary MF (PMF), post-polycythemia vera MF (PPV-MF) or post-essential thrombocythemia MF (PET-MF).
Primary Myelofibrosis
