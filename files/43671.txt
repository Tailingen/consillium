Procalcitonin Reveals Early Dehiscence in Gastric Surgery: the PREDIGS Study
Background. Gastric cancer surgery is associated with high risk for postoperative morbidity and mortality. Anastomotic leak (AL) is one of the worst complications associated with relevant short and long-term sequelae. Procalcitonin (PCT) is a biomarker used to monitor bacterial infections and guide antibiotic therapy and has been shown to have better predictive value of AL after colorectal surgery than C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell count (WBC).

Purpose. Investigators designed a monocentric pilot study to test if PCT might be a sensitive and reliable marker of AL after gastric surgery
Gastric Cancer
OTHER: gastric cancer pts undergoing surgery
% of patients with leaks after gastric surgery correctly identified by the biomarkers (PCT and CRP), PCT: procalcitonin, CRP: C-reactive protein, 2 years|% of patients without leaks after gastric surgery correctly identified by PCT and CRP, PCT: procalcitonin, CRP: C-reactive protein, 2 years
PCT cut-off that gives good negative predictive (NPV) value for leak after gastric surgery in 3rd POD, procalcitonin (PCT) cuts-off in 3rd post-operative day (POD) with a good NPV, 2 years|PCT cut-off that gives good negative predictive value for leak after gastric surgery in 5th POD, PCT cuts-off in 5th POD with a good NPV, 2 years
