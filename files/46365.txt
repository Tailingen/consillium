Pathologic Complete Response（pCR） rate, Pathological complete response (pCR) rate is defined as the proportion of participants whose tumor in the stomach and lymph node completely disappeared, as determined by a pathologist., up to 8 weeks after surgery
Major pathological response (MPR) rate, Major pathological response (MPR) rate is defined as the proportion of participants whose percentage of residual tumor in the stomach and lymph node decreased to \< 10%, as determined by a pathologist., up to 8 weeks after surgery|Objective Response Rate （ORR）, An objective response is defined as either a confirmed CR or a PR, as determined by the investigator using RECIST v1.1Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) from the National Cancer Institute (NCI)., through study completion, an average of 1 year|Event Free Survival（EFS）, proportion of participants who have no events，including death, disease progression, change of chemotherapy regimen, switching to chemotherapy, addition of other treatments, occurrence of lethal or intolerable side effects, etc, up to 3 years
