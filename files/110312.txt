Doxorubicin, Paclitaxel, and Carboplatin in Treating Patients With Primary Stage III, Stage IV, or Recurrent Endometrial Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining doxorubicin, paclitaxel, and carboplatin in treating patients who have primary stage III, stage IV, or recurrent endometrial cancer.
Endometrial Cancer
DRUG: carboplatin|DRUG: doxorubicin hydrochloride|DRUG: paclitaxel
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the response rate and duration of response in patients with primary stage III or IV or recurrent endometrial cancer treated with sequential doxorubicin, paclitaxel, and carboplatin.

OUTLINE: Patients receive sequential chemotherapy comprised of doxorubicin IV once every 2 weeks for 3 courses, followed by paclitaxel IV over 1 hour once weekly for 9 courses, and then carboplatin IV once every 3 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-46 patients will be accrued for this study.
