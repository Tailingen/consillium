Overall response rate (ORR), To evaluate disease objective response rate (ORR) of nivolumab in combination with gemcitabine and TS1 in patients with advanced biliary tract cancer, 1 year
The primary endpoint will be evaluating overall response rate (ORR) of nivolumab in combination with gemcitabine and TS-1 in patients with advanced BTC. Simon's two-stage design will be used. If there are 3 or fewer subjects with controlled disease in these 19 patients, the study will be stopped. Otherwise, 25 additional patients will be accrued for a total of 44. The null hypothesis will be rejected if 11 or more subjects with controlled disease are observed in 44 patients.
