PROCEDURE: IVF|DRUG: Gonadotropin
Live birth rate, Number of live births divided by the number of women, 9 months
Clinical pregnancy rate, Number of clinical pregnancies divided by the number of women, 6-8 weeks gestational age|Multifetal pregnancy rate, Number of multifetal pregnancies divided by the number of clinical pregnancies, 12 weeks gestational age|Miscarriage rate, Number of first trimester miscarriages (before 12 weeks gestational age) divided by the number of clinical pregnancies, 12 weeks gestational age|Incidence of early ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), Incidence of OHSS within 9 days of final triggering of oocyte maturation, Within 9 days of final triggering of oocyte maturation
Women will be randomly divided into two groups; IVF group and gonadotropin group. Women in the IVF group will undergo one full IVF cycle. Women in the gonadotropin group will be subjected to ovarian stimulation for 6 months with the gonadotropin low-dose step-down protocol.
