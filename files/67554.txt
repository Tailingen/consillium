Combination Margetuximab, Retifanlimab, Tebotelimab, and Chemotherapy Phase 2/3 Trial in HER2+ Gastric/GEJ Cancer
This is a Phase 2/3, randomized, open-label study for the treatment of patients with HER2-positive Gastric cancer (GC) or Gastroesophageal Junction (GEJ) cancer conducted in two parts.

Part A is a single-arm cohort (Cohort A, 40 to 110 participants) will evaluate safety and efficacy of margetuximab plus retifanlimab.

Part B Part 1 has 4 arms (50 patients/arm). Participants will be randomized to margetuximab plus retifanlimab plus chemotherapy, margetuximab plus tebotelimab, plus chemotherapy, margetuximab plus chemotherapy, or trastuzumab plus chemotherapy.

Number of Participants With Adverse Events of Margetuximab Plus Retifanlimab in Cohort A, as Assessed by CTCAE v5.0, Evaluation of adverse events and serious adverse events (Cohort A), Throughout the study, an average of 11 months.|Objective Response Rate (ORR) for Non-microsatellite Instability-high (Non-MSI-H) Participants (Cohort A) Using Investigator-assessed Radiology Reviews, Percent of non MSI-H participants with best overall response of complete response (CR) plus partial response (PR) per RECIST 1.1 (Cohorts A ) based on investigator assessment.

CR is defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions with no new lesions appearing PR is defined as \>= to a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of target lesions, non-progression of non- target lesions, with no new lesions appearing.

CR + PR = ORR, Throughout the study, an average of 11 months.
Median Progression-free Survival Using Investigator-assessed Radiology Reviews in Cohort A, Time from start of study treatment to the first documented disease progression per RECIST v1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. (Cohorts A) based on investigator assessment, Throughout the study, an average of 11 months.|Median Duration of Response in Cohort A Using Investigator-assessed Radiology Reviews, Time from the date of initial response (CR or PR) to the date of first documented progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (Cohorts A), Throughout the study, an average of 11 months.|Disease Control Rate, Percentage of patients who experienced response of CR, PR or stable disease for at least 3 months from start of study treatment (Cohorts A and B), Throughout the study, an average of 11 months.|ORR for Cohort B, Proportion of participants with best overall response of CR plus PR per RECIST 1.1, Throughout the study, an average of 11 months.|Number of Participants Who Have Antidrug Antibodies (ADA) to Margetuximab, Throughout the study, an average of 11 months.|Number of Participants Who Have ADA to Retifanlimab, Throughout the study, an average of 11 months.|Number of Participants Who Have ADA to Tebotelimab, Throughout the study, an average of 11 months.
