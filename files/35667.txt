Personalising and Refining Neo-adjuvant Chemotherapy in Locally Advanced but Resecable Colon Cancer in the Elderly of 70 Years Old or More
Colon cancer (CC) is the 5th most common cancer worldwide. Standard care for locally advanced disease is surgical resection followed by 3-6 months of adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) with oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil (OxFp).

Almost all of these patients undergo surgery, but many do not receive AC due to frailty (following surgery). This particularly affects patients over 70, who represent the majority of patients diagnosed with CC.
