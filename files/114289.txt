High Field Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Imaging for Follow Up of Prostate Cancer Post Brachytherapy Implantation
The purpose of this study is to establish the correct scanning parameters for obtaining good quality 3 Tesla (3T) magnetic resonance spectroscopy images (MRSI) of the prostate gland before and after brachytherapy implantation for prostate cancer. Three Tesla MRSI may be a valuable additional diagnostic and follow-up investigation for prostate cancer patients.
