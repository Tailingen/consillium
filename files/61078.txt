Treatment of Advanced or Metastatic Triple-negative Breast Cancer With Adoptive Therapy of PD1+ TILS
This is a prospective, multicenter, phase I/II, open-label, two-stage design of PD1+ TILs infusion in metastatic or advanced TNBC. TILS001 includes 3 parts. Previous to each phase inclusion, a specific ICF must be signed by the patient. Participants potentially eligible to participate in the clinical trial will be offered to sign a ICF three times prior to TILs treatment: 1) to allow for collection of archival FFPE tissue samples for determination PD1 by mRNA (Part #1), 2) prior to a fresh metastatic biopsy for selection, isolation and partial expansion of PD1+ TILs (Part #2) and 3) prior to allow for remaining study procedures and TILs therapy (Part #3, Main Consent).
Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Carcinoma
DRUG: PD1+ TILs (NUMARZU-001) product infusion

This trial has been developed in TNBC, a breast cancer subtype with a particularly poor prognosis. The product used for treating participating patients will be selected PD1-positive TILs. Such TILs will be manufactured in Hospital Clinic under the name of NUMARZU-001. The procotol has been designed in three parts to better select participating patients. Molecular pre-screening has been established to select tumors with a higher probability of enrichment by PD1-positive TILs. The pre- screening consists of performing a tumor biopsy and selecting isolation and expansion of PD1- postive TILs to manufacture the final product NUMARZU-001. This part could last almost four weeks, as such patients will continue with the established treatment in the meanwhile. Finally, NUMARZU-001 will be administered if the patient is eligible for part three of the protocol.
