Proactive Care Coordination for Cancer Survivors Who Smoke
This is a population-based randomized controlled trial of 600 patients with a diagnosis of cancer in the past 2 years and registry indicating smoking at the time of diagnosis, that will inform critical questions regarding the relative efficacy of care coordination options, the reliability of Electronic Health Record (EHR) tobacco use data, and how patients will react to proactive tobacco related communications. Investigators will compare the reach and efficacy of two proactive approaches to enrolling cancer survivors in tobacco treatment (Arm 1: mailed care coordination vs. Arm 2: telephone care coordination) using a two-arm randomized design at two urban cancer centers, and will explore cancer survivor attitudes and preferences about proactive tobacco treatment.
