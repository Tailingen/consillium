AGN-CognI.Q Acute Dose Safety and Pharmacokinetics Dose-Response in Prostate Cancer Patients
This study is to obtain acute dose safety and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) data in a dose-response trial in prostate cancer patients.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: AGN-CognI.Q
Electrocardiography (EKG) QTC Interval, Cardiac safety measured by EKG QT Interval at baseline, at 5 hours (+/-60mins) and 24 h (+/-2hrs) after study drug treatment every study visit (usually weekly) up to 5 weeks, 5-6 weeks|Safety blood lab tests, CBC diff for hematological safety and CMP for liver and kidney safety at baseline and 24 +/- 2 h after dose and before the next dose level (the latter also serves as baseline for the next dose)., 5-6 weeks
Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax), PK metrics of decursin (D) and its isomer decursinol angelate (DA) and their metabolite decursinol (DOH) will be measured in blood collected at pre-each dose baseline (0 h labs= baseline), 2h (+/- 30 mins), 3h (+/- 30 mins), 4h (+/- 30 mins), 5h (+/- 30 mins), 6h (+/-30mins), 7h (+/- 30 mins), and 24 h (+/-2hrs) to estimate Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax)., 4-6 weeks|Plasma Concentration versus time curve (AUC), PK metrics of decursin (D) and its isomer decursinol angelate (DA) and their metabolite decursinol (DOH) will be measured in blood collected at pre-each dose baseline (0 h labs= baseline), 2h (+/- 30 mins), 4h (+/- 30 mins), 6h (+/-30mins) and 24 h (+/-2hrs) to estimate Area under the Plasma Concentration versus time curve (AUC)., 4-6 weeks
The long-term goal of the study is to conduct human clinical trials to test Angelica gigas Nakai (AGN) root alcoholic extract herbal supplement product (AGN-CognI.Q, or CognI.QTM, made with INMÂ®176 proprietary ingredient, Quality of Life Laboratories, Purchase, NY) as a safe and potential efficacious modality for prostate cancer interception akin to secondary prevention to delay hormonal therapy or avoid it entirely after patients have developed recurrent disease following their standard of care (SOC) surgery and radiation curative treatment. The acute dose safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) information in the target patient population from the current proposed acute PK dose-response trial will inform the optimal design and execution of the longer-term safety and efficacy (phase I/II) trials.
