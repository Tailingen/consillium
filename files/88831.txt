Racotumomab in Patients With High-risk Neuroblastoma
This clinical trial will be carried out in children diagnosed with high-risk neuroblastoma that have achieved a complete or very good partial response after standard therapy. An additional cohort of children who could not achieve these response criteria or that relapsed after standard therapy but do not have progressive disease will receive Racotumomab together with metronomic chemotherapy.

The main objectives of this study are to determine the immune response after one-year duration immunization with Racotumomab, to describe the response of Racotumomab therapy in minimal residual disease (MRD) in bone marrow and to describe the toxicity profile of Racotumomab.
Neuroblastoma
DRUG: Racotumomab
Number of participants who elicit an immune response to a one-year immunization schedule of racotumomab in a cohort study of patients with high-risk neuroblastoma., 1 year
Number of participants in whom minimally disseminated disease in the bone marrow decreases or disappears with a one-year immunization schedule of racotumomab compared to baseline values at study entry., 1 year|Number of Participants With Treatment-Related Adverse Events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0 after a one-year immunization schedule of racotumomab when administered alone or together with onco-specific metronomic chemotherapy therapy., 1 year|Pattern of expression of N-Glycolyl-GM3 gangliosides in tumor samples obtained at disease diagnosis and during follow up if available., 1 year
Neuroblastoma is the most common extra-cranial tumor in childhood but prognosis is still poor, even with the advances in its treatment.

New therapeutic strategies have been examined, and several immunotherapeutic approaches, including combined therapy with monoclonal antibodies (anti-GD2), intravenous interleukin-2 (Il-2) and intravenous granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and anti-idiotype vaccines are currently being assessed.

Racotumomab is an anti-idiotype antibody capable of inducing anti-N-glycolyl GM3 antibodies in patients with neuroblastoma.

The expression of the ganglioside N-glycolyl GM3 was shown in neuroblastoma and this expression could be useful as a specific target for immunotherapy.

Ractoumomab will be administered once standard therapy for neuroblastoma has been completed.
