Immunotherapy SBRT Sensitization of the Programmed Death-1 (PD-1) Effect
The purpose of this study is to determine efficacy, safety of Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) in combination with immunotherapy in participants with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who are eligible for an immunotherapy agent.

RADIATION: Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy
Overall Survival, Determine overall survival in patients receiving SBRT and immunotherapy as compared to landmark trials of patients receiving immunotherapy alone (Checkmate 057, Keynote 024), 24 months|Acute Toxicity: Radiation pnuemonitis measured using NCI CTCAE version 4.0, Determine excess/unexpected toxicity that cannot be attributed to routine radiation therapy or immunotherapy side effects., 0-15 weeks
Progression Free Survival, 1. To determine the progression free survival measured from time of enrollment to first evidence of progressive disease and evaluated 3 months after treatment initiation, 3-24 Months|Local Control, To determine the local control measured from time of enrollment to first evidence of progressive disease at the treatment site, 0-24 Months|Late Toxicity: Pulmonary, Bone or Visceral organ toxicity evaluated 6 months from completion of treatment using NCI CTCAE version 4., the incidence of grade ≥ 3 , pneumonitis 6 months after completing SBRT the incidence of any grade pulmonary fibrosis 6 months after completing SBRT the incidence of grade ≥ 3 , bone fracture 6 months after completing SBRT the incidence of grade ≥ 3 visceral organ toxicity at or near a treated site (e.g colitis, nephritis, hepatitis) 6 months after completing SBRT, 6-24 Months|Impact of Tumor Burden, To determine the influence of number of metastatic sites on OS, and PFS. Patients will be stratified based on number of metastatic sites \<=3, 4-5, \>5, 24 Months
Blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 T-cell checkpoint pathway is an effective and well tolerated approach to stimulating the immune response which is a critical option in the treatment of metastatic NSCLC. However, progression free survival (PFS) is increased by only 2-4 months and median overall survival (OS) by 3-9 months.

There is compelling evidence that PFS is increased up to 3 fold and OS by 2 fold in patients receiving a course of radiation therapy while on immunotherapy. Radiotherapy is known to induce immunogenic tumor cell death and upregulation of dendritic cells and antigen presentation leading to activation of cytotoxic T-Cells. Dramatic T-cell activation has been demonstrated where tumor regression occurs outside the radiation treatment field in a phenomenon termed the abscopal effect and is associated with high dose radiation delivered via SBRT.

As such, SBRT activation of T-cells could be complementary to immunotherapy and enhance T-cell mediated killing via PD-L1 blockade which could lead to lasting and durable tumor response with improved progression free survival and overall survival.
