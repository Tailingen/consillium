Study on Fluids Associated to Lung Cancer
The diagnosis of lung cancer is the first cause of cancer deaths for man and woman. It requires invasive procedures (at least endoscopy, transthoracic puncture, or surgery).

This study is about the set up of an innovative test for lung cancer prognosis, based on biopsies and surgical material : LungCancerTest, with the creation of a start-up in progress.

The main goal of this study is to approve the diagnostic value of the molecular signature of the 26 genes (LungCancerTest) revealed in blood and respiratory fluids among patients with lung cancer.
