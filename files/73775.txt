Immediate Axillary Plasty With a Pedicled Muscle Flap for Breast Cancer Related Lymphedema Prevention
The purpose of this comparable cohort study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of immediate axillary plasty with pedicled partial Latissimus Dorsi muscle flap for lymphedema prevention in breast cancer patients who are undergoing axillary dissection.
Lymphedema|Breast Neoplasm
PROCEDURE: Immediate Axillary Plasty
Incidence of lymphedema and/or severity of lymphedema, Up to 3 years
Shoulder Mobility, Shoulder Mobility： the difference between baseline and postoperation，including flexion extension rotation abduction and adduction., up to 3 years|Postoperation seroma, The incidence of axilla and donor site, up to one month|Acute Upper limb thrombosis, The incidence of thrombosis linked to postoperation immobility, Up to one month
Upper limb lymphedema is the main complication of axillary dissection. It is estimated that as many as 50% of patients undergoing lymph node dissection go on to develop lymphedema, with significantly decreased quality of life with frequent infections, decreased range of motion, and a cosmetic deformity. The treatment of lymphedema was be frustrated by technical difficulties and gave rise to a heavy budget burden. Some retrospective studies revealed that immediate and delayed breast reconstruction with lattismus dorsi flap brought unexpected relief to the upper limb lymphedema. The current study was composed to assess whether transferring a pedicled partial latissimus dorsi muscle flap to the axilla would prevent the occurrence of post-mastectomy lymphedema.

This prospectively designed cohort study have two parallel arms. Patients undergoing axillary dissection would be recruited to one of the two groups, according their own preference.
