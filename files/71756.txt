Electrocautery vs Q-switch for Seborrheic Keratosis
The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy and risk of adverse events of electrocautery versus 532 nm Q-switched neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) laser for the treatment of flat seborrheic keratoses.

This study is a pilot study designed to determine feasibility of these procedures.
