Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) for Unresectable Liver Metastases
This is a Phase II study to determine the efficacy of SBRT to treat liver metastases in patients with Colorectal Adenocarcinoma, Carcinoma of the Anal Canal and Gastrointestinal Neuroendocrine Tumors that are not amenable to surgery. Patients should have no evidence of extra-hepatic disease or have disease that is planned to be treated with curative intent.

Therefore, SBRT is being considered as a potentially curative procedure.

Local Progression Free Survival, - Local Progression Free Survival of treated lesions in evaluable patients. Local Progression Free Survival will be defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria applied to the Planning Target Volume (PTV) and 1cm around (assessment of marginal failure).

Time-to-events will be counted from the date of initiation of treatment. Patients will be considered evaluable if followed for at least 6 months after SBRT. A review after 6 months is due to the transient changes after irradiation that make uncertain radiological evaluation before 6 months., 2 years
