Utility of CAML as Diagnostic for Early Stage Lung Cancer
Primary Objective Determine the prevalence of CAMLS in patients with pulmonary nodules.

Secondary Objectives Determine the positive and negative predictive value of CAMLS in patients with pulmonary nodules who undergo biopsy.

Model combinations of clinical factors with the presence/absence of CAMLS to refine strategies for assessment of patients with pulmonary nodules. Evaluate whether these measures result in enhanced T-cell activity and/or NK cell function and number
Pulmonary Nodule, Multiple|Pulmonary Nodule, Solitary
Determination of prevalence pf CAMLs in Pulmonary modules, Laboratory studies performed on blood drawn at Creatv Microtech will determine the prevalence of CAMLS in pulmonary nodules., During the first 2 years of study
Determination of positive and negative predictive value, sensitivity and specificity of CAMLS in patients with pulmonary nodules who undergo biopsy, Positive Predictive Value and Negative Predictive Value, sensitivity and specificity at the initial screen will be computed for the entire study population., Through study completion, an average of 3 years|Model combinations of clinical factors with the presence/absence of CAMLs to refine strategies for assessment of patients with pulmonary nodules. Evaluate whether measures result in enhanced T-cell activity/Natural Killer (NK) cell function and number, Bidimensional measurements of lung nodules done by a radiologist or pulmonary physician from CT scans with 5mm (or less) cuts, using lung windows in the axial plane, Through study completion, a maximum of 3 years
Primary Objective Determine the prevalence of CAMLS in patients with pulmonary nodules.

Secondary Objectives Determine the positive and negative predictive value of CAMLS in patients with pulmonary nodules who undergo biopsy.

Model combinations of clinical factors with the presence/absence of CAMLS to refine strategies for assessment of patients with pulmonary nodules. Evaluate whether these measures result in enhanced T-cell activity and/or NK cell function and number
