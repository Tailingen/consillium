Refractory Acute Leukemia|Relapsed Acute Leukemia
DRUG: Cladribine|DRUG: Cytarabine|DRUG: Sorafenib|DRUG: Decitabine
Safety and adverse events (AEs), Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, Through study completion; an average of 1 year
Primary Objectives - To determine the safety, tolerability, and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of the combination of cladribine, low-dose cytarabine, sorafeneib alternating with decitabine for pediatric participants with acute leukemias.

Secondary Objectives

- To determine the preliminary assessment of efficacy by overall response (OR), including complete remission (CR), CR with partial hematological recovery (CRh), CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi), Morphologic leukemia free state (MLFS) and partial remission (PR), overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS) and duration of response (DOR) of pediatric participants treated with this combination.
