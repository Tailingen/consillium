Phase 1 Study of CC-486 in Japanese Subjects With Hematological Neoplasms
To identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of oral azacitidine on different treatment schedules in Japanese subjects with hematological neoplasms
Myelodysplastic Syndromes|Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia|Acute Myeloid Leukemia|Multiple Myeloma|Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma|Hodgkin Lymphoma
DRUG: Oral azacitidine
Dose limiting toxicities, Number of subjects experiencing dose limiting toxicity during the first 28-day cycle, For 28 days
Number of participants with adverse events., Number of participants with adverse events. An AE is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the subject's health, including laboratory test values (as specified by the criteria below), regardless of etiology., Up to 4 years|Pharmacokinetics - Cmax, Maximum observed concentration in plasma, On day 1 and day 8|Pharmacokinetics - Tmax, Observed time to first maximum plasma concentration, On day 1 and day 8|Pharmacokinetics - AUCt, Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to the last quantifiable time point, calculated by the linear trapezoidal rule, On day 1 and day 8|Pharmacokinetics - AUC Zero to Infinity, Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity, calculated by the linear trapezoidal rule and extrapolated to infinity will be calculated according to the following equation: AUC∞ = AUCt + (Ct/λz), where Ct is the last quantifiable concentration If the percentage of AUC extrapolated is ≥ 25%, AUC∞ will not be reported., On day 1 and day 8|Pharmacokinetics - AUCext%, Percentage of AUC∞ due to extrapolation from the time from the last quantifiable concentration to infinity, calculated as (AUC∞ - AUCt) / AUC∞ ×100, On day 1 and day 8|Pharmacokinetics - Terminal Phase, Terminal phase rate constant, determined by linear regression of the terminal points of the log-linear plasma concentration-time curve Visual assessment may be used to identify the terminal linear phase of the concentration versus time profile. A minimum of three data points will be used for calculation. λz will not be estimated if the terminal phase of the log-concentration versus time profile does not exhibit a linear decline phase, or if the regression coefficient \< 0.8., On day 1 and day 8|Pharmacokinetics - Terminal Half-Life, Terminal phase half-life, will be calculated according to the following equation: t1/2 = 0.693/λz, On day 1 and day 8|Pharmacokinetics - Total Clearance, Apparent total clearance, calculated as Dose/AUC∞, On day 1 and day 8|Pharmacokinetics - Volume of distribution, Apparent volume of distribution will be calculated according to the equation: Vz/F = (CL/F)/λz, On day 1 and day 8|Pharmacokinetics - Aet, Cumulative amount excreted from time zero to time t (ng), calculated as the summation of the amounts (Aet, product of urine volume and urine concentration) excreted in subsequent collection intervals, On day 1 and day 8|Pharmacokinetics - fet, Cumulative fraction of dose excreted in the urine from time zero to time t (%), calculated as Ae t divided by dose, On day 1 and day 8|Pharmacokinetics - Renal Clearance, Renal clearance (mL/min), calculated as Aet divided by AUCt, On day 1 and day 8|Investigator's response assessment, Number of participants who demonstrate response by investigator's assessment based on International Working Group (IWG) criteria Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS), Chronic myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML) and Acute Myeloid (AML), IMWG criteria for Multiple Myeloma (MM), and modified Cheson 2007 criteria for Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) or Hodgkin's Lymphoma (HL), Up to 4 years
This is a phase 1, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study that will evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of CC-486 in Japanese subjects with hematological neoplasms including myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), multiple myeloma (MM), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), or Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). A standard phase 1 design for MTD determination, an open label, dose ascending, "3 + 3" design, is adopted in this study. This study consists of screening phase, MTD determination phase, and treatment phase. Each subject continues study treatment until documentation of progressive disease or discontinuation of study treatment for any reason. Originally only MDS subjects were targeted and the MTD of CC-486 when administered once daily (QD) for 21 days in a 28-day cycle would be evaluated in this study. Currently CC-486 is being clinically developed with both 14-day and 21-day dosing schedules in various diseases. This study was suspended to amend protocol to evaluate the MTD on these different dosing schedule in larger population. This study was re-opened after amended protocol was approved by institutional review board at study site.
