Short-term Preoperative Treatment With Enzalutamide, Alone or in Combination With Exemestane in Primary Breast Cancer
Open-label, international, multicentre window of opportunity phase II trial to evaluate the effects of short-term preoperative therapy with enzalutamide (alone or in combination with exemestane) in women with newly diagnosed invasive primary breast cancer. The study has two cohorts:

* ER+ve breast cancer
* AR+ve, Triple-negative (i.e. ER-negative, PR-negative and HER2-negative) breast cancer

Study treatment is planned for a minimum of 15 days and a maximum of 29 days unless there is evidence of unacceptable toxicity or the patient requests to be withdrawn from the trial. Thereafter, patients will either be considered for definitive surgery or primary medical treatment (e.g. neoadjuvant chemotherapy) at the discretion of the treating physician.

The effects of enzalutamide (alone or in combination with exemestane) will be assessed on tumour tissue specimens taken at baseline and on the last day of study treatment.

DRUG: Enzalutamide|DRUG: Exemestane
Determine the difference in geometric mean change in Ki67 expression between the two treatment groups of patients in the ER+ Cohort, The geometric mean change will be determined by the change in Ki67 expression in tumour biopsy samples collected at the End of Treatment to those collected at Pre-Treatment, 24 months|Determine the individual anti-proliferative response (RRΔKi67) for patients in the AR+ TNBC cohort, The anti-proliferative response is defined as a ≥50% fall in Ki67 expression over the course of the study treatment, 24 months
Determine the geometric mean change in Ki67 expression at the end of study treatment (Mean ΔKi67) for patients in the AR+ TNBC cohort, 24 months|Determine the geometric mean Ki67 expression at the end of study treatment (Mean Ki67post) for patients in the ER+ cohort, 24 months|Determine the individual end-of treatment anti-proliferative response (RRKi67-Post) for all patients., The RRKi67-Post is defined as the natural logarithm of percentage positive Ki67 of less than 1 at the end of study treatment. For patients in the TNBC cohort, the analysis will be limited to patients with pre-treatment Ln (%Ki67) ≥ 1., 24 months|Determine the individual anti-proliferative response (RRΔKi67) for patients in the ER+ cohort., The RRΔKi67 is defined as a ≥50% fall in Ki67 expression over the course of the study treatment, 24 months|Determine the geometric mean change in Caspase-3 between end of study treatment and pre-treatment tumour samples (Mean ΔCaspase-3)., 24 months|Determine the individual apoptotic response (RRΔCaspase-3)., RRΔCaspase-3 is defined as a ≥50% increase in Caspase-3 over the course of the study treatment, 24 months|Establish the safety and tolerability of enzalutamide alone and in combination with exemestane in this population through review of all AEs and SAEs assessed by CTCAE v4.03, Safety and tolerability will be assessed through reviewing:

* Incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs)
* Incidence of grade 3 and 4 adverse events (AEs) (CTCAE, version 4.03)
* Incidence of all AEs of all grades
* Clinically significant changes in vital signs and clinical laboratory results during and following study drug administration, 24 months|Measure the plasma levels of circulating hormones in blood samples collected prior to and at the end of study treatment., Plasma levels of androstenedione, DHT, estradiol, estrone, estrone sulfate, follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, progesterone, sex hormone binding globulin, and total/free testosterone will be measured., 24 months
