A Study Comparing Neoadjuvant Chemoimmunotherapy and Immuno-consolidationafter Compared With Immunoconsolidation After Radical Chemoradiotherapy for Stage III Potentially Resectable NSCLC
To evaluate the efficacy and safety adebrelimab in Combination with chemotherapy after 3 cycles as neoadjuvant therapy and surgery or chemoradiotherapy based on MDT compared with adebrelimab after chemoradiotherapy in potentially operable stage III NSCLC.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Adebrelimab|RADIATION: radical chemoradiotherapy|DRUG: Platinum based chemotherapy
2 year EFS rate, From the start of randomization to 2 years, the proportion of participants who experience any of the following events: disease progression making surgical treatment impossible, local or distant recurrence, or death due to any cause.

Event-free Survival (EFS) is a term commonly used in the context of clinical trials and oncology to describe a period during which a patient with a disease, typically a cancer, remains free from any adverse events that are of clinical significance., Up to 2 years
OS, Overall Survival, the time from the date of randomization until the death of the participant or the last follow-up., Up to 2 years|TTDM, the time from the initial diagnosis of a cancer until the first occurrence of distant metastasis., Up to 2 years|TRAEs, Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by NCI-CTCAE v5.0, Up to 2 years
In recent years, tumor immunotherapy has become an important means of clinical treatment of tumor. The emergence of immunotherapy has provided a new direction for the exploration of neoadjuvant therapy for non-small cell lung cancer. The purpose of this study is to compare the use of adebrelimab in patients with stage III potentially resectable locally advanced NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer). The study will directly compare the curative chemoradiotherapy plus immune maintenance therapy model (Pacific model) with the neoadjuvant immune therapy plus curative surgery plus immune maintenance therapy model (Keynote-671 model). This comparison aims to provide a basis for determining treatment plans for patients with locally advanced NSCLC.
