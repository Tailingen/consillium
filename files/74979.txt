The Value of Dual-parametric Magnetic Resonance Combined with Regional Saturation Biopsy in Patients with Suspected Prostate Cancer
The aim of this study was to investigate the value of dual-parameter magnetic resonance imaging(bpMRI) combined with regional saturation biopsy in the diagnosis of prostate cancer by means of a prospective randomized controlled study.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

Can bpMRI guide the timing of prostate puncture and avoid unnecessary prostate biopsy? Effectiveness of focal saturation biopsy versus systemic biopsy + targeted biopsy.
Prostate Cancer
PROCEDURE: Follow up if MRI is negative|PROCEDURE: Systematic biopsy if MRI is negative
The clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) detection rate, csPCa was defined as PCa with a grade group \> 2 or GS â‰¥ 7. The reference standard was the pathological result., One month after the biopsy procedure.
The Gleason score (GS) of the biopsy sample, The Gleason score (GS) was reported by senior uropathologists according to the Standards of Reporting for MRI Targeted Biopsy Studies (START) criteria and interpreted according to the recommendations of the International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Grade Group. The minimum and maximum of GS are 3 and 5. The higher GS means the higher pathological grade., One month after the biopsy procedure.|The PCa detection rate, One month after the biopsy procedure.
