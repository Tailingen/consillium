Reducing Pain and Disability After Breast Cancer Surgery
The purpose of this study is to determine if the combination of thoracic paravertebral block and multimodal analgesia will decrease chronic pain and arm morbidity in patients undergoing breast cancer surgery with lymph node dissection as compared to patients receiving local anesthesia with multimodal analgesia.
Breast Cancer|Chronic Pain
PROCEDURE: Thoracic Paravertebral Block (TPVB)|PROCEDURE: Local Anesthetic
The Proportion of Individuals Reporting Chronic Postoperative Pain 12 Months Following Breast Cancer Surgery With Lymph Node Dissection., 1 year
Arm Morbidity, Shoulder Range of Motion, Quality of Analgesia, Arm Lymphedema, Time to Meet Discharge Criteria, Quality of Recovery, Quality of Life, Incidence of Postoperative Side Effects., Brief Pain Inventory (BPI); Flexion, extension, abduction, internal, and external rotation of the shoulder; Constant score; Quality of life was assessed using the FACTB4 and the SF-12 Health Survey (SF12); Details of the surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy were recorded, 1 year
Sixty percent of breast cancer patients undergo some form of breast surgery in the treatment of the early stages of the disease. The recovery from surgery can be associated with severe disabling pain persisting beyond 12 months after surgery. Research in pain has shown that early intervention of acute pain can prevent long term chronic pain.

At The Ottawa Hospital, patients receive either paravertebral blocks or wound infiltration with local anesthetic for postoperative pain management. We would like to compare these two methods of pain control to determine an analgesic technique that will reduce acute and chronic pain, and maximally improve long-term functional recovery and patient's quality of life.
