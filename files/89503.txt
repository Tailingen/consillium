A Study of Intravesical Apaziquone as a Surgical Adjuvant in Participant Undergoing Transurethral Resection Bladder Tumor (TURBT)
This is a Phase 3, randomized, multicenter, multi-arm, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of apaziquone in participants with ≤4 non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), ≤3.5 centimeters (cm) in diameter, all of which must had been fully resected at TURBT.

In addition to Screening, participants underwent an assessment of urothelial carcinoma of the bladder via cystoscopy for clinically apparent tumor Ta, G1-G2.

Following TURBT on Day 1, eligible participants were randomized to one of three treatment arms in a 1:1:1 ratio.

Arm 1 : One dose of Apaziquone. Arm 2 : Two Doses of Apaziquone. Arm 3 : Placebo. Primary endpoint was to evaluate the Time to Recurrence with either a one instillation of 4 mg apaziquone or two instillations of 4 milligram (mg) apaziquone relative to placebo instillation following TURBT in a participant with NMIBC who received TURBT.
Bladder Cancer
DRUG: Apaziquone|OTHER: Placebo
Time to Recurrence, Time from randomization to the date of histologically confirmed recurrence of bladder cancer. A recurrence was defined as any pathologically confirmed disease of ≥Ta tumor histology or carcinoma in situ (CIS) post-treatment., From randomization to the date of first histologically confirmed recurrence of bladder cancer (up to 1.5 years)
2-Year Recurrence Rate, The percentage of participants with histologically confirmed recurrence of the bladder tumor at any time after randomization and on or before Year 2. A recurrence was defined as any pathologically confirmed disease of ≥Ta tumor histology or CIS post-treatment., 2 years|1-Year Recurrence Rate, The percentage of participants with histologically confirmed recurrence of the bladder tumor at any time after randomization and on or before Year 1. A recurrence was defined as any pathologically confirmed disease of ≥Ta tumor histology or CIS post-treatment., 1 year|Time to Progression, Time to disease progression was defined as the time from randomization to the first disease progression. The development of T2 or greater disease was only included in the assessment of time to disease progression., From randomization to the date of first disease progression (up to 1.5 years)|Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Treatment-Related Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), TEAEs Leading to Discontinuation and Death, An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. TEAEs were adverse events that occurred from the first dose of study treatment until 40 days after the last dose of study drug administration or 40 days after the date of participant early discontinuation. Treatment-related AEs included TEAEs with relationship to study treatment reported as possible, probable, definite, or missing. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the outcomes: death; initial/prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience; persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly., Up to 1.5 Years
This is a Phase 3, randomized, multicenter, multi-arm, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of apaziquone in participants with ≤4 non-muscle invasive bladder tumors, ≤3.5 cm in diameter, all of which must have been fully resected at TURBT.

In addition to Screening, participants underwent an assessment of urothelial carcinoma of the bladder via cystoscopy for clinically apparent tumor Ta, G1-G2.

Following TURBT on Day 1, eligible participants were randomized to one of three treatment arms in a 1:1:1 ratio :

Arm 1 : One Dose of Apaziquone:

* Day 1: administration of 4 mg of apaziquone 60±30 minutes post-TURBT
* Day 15 (±5 days): administration of placebo

Arm 2 : Two Doses of Apaziquone :

* Day 1: administration of 4 mg of apaziquone 60±30 minutes post-TURBT
* Day 15 (±5 days): administration of 4 mg of apaziquone

Arm 3: Placebo :

* Day 1 : administration of placebo 60±30 minutes post-TURBT
* Day 15 (±5 days) : administration of placebo

Once randomized, Day 1 study drug instillation occurred 60 ±30 minutes post TURBT. Participants returned on Day 15 (±5 days) for a second instillation unless their pathology results showed non Ta, G1-G2 histology; in the absence of local pathology results by the Day 15 visit, participants received a second instillation of study drug. All histology specimens were reviewed by a local pathology laboratory and all clinical treatment decisions and study analyses were based on the local pathology review. Participants whose pathology was other than Ta, G1-G2 were followed for safety at Day 35 (±5 days) from the last dose of study drug and then discontinued from the study.

Participants with pathology confirmed Ta, G1-G2 disease were followed according to the schedule below :

* Cystoscopic examination and urine cytology every 90 days (±10 days) (calculated from date of TURBT) through 24 months for tumor recurrence and progression.
* If at any time during the 24 months follow up period there was a tumor recurrence, the participant continued on study with follow-up cystoscopic examination and urine cytology every 90 days (±10 days) (calculated from date of TURBT) through the end of 24 months. Participants with a recurrence were permitted to have a follow-up TURBT.
* If at any time during the 24 months follow up period there was a tumor recurrence and/or participant started on another therapy, the participant was followed by telephone, for safety every 90 days (±10 days) (calculated from date of TURBT) through the end of 24 months.

Duration of Study: The duration of the study for each participant was approximately 24 months including:

* Screening Period : 30-days
* Treatment Period : Day 1 and Day 15 (±5 days)
* Safety and Follow-up Period: 24-months
