Universal Chimeric Antigen Receptor-modified AT19 Cells for CD19+ Relapsed/Refractory Hematological Malignancies
This is a single-center, open-label, single-arm study to evaluate the primary safety and efficacy of universal chimeric antigen receptor-modified AT19 cells in patients with relapsed or refractory hematological malignancies.
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia|Chronic Lymphoblastic Leukemia|B-cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Fludarabine + Cyclophosphamide + CAR-NK-CD19 Cells
Incidence of Treatment-related Adverse Events, Therapy-related adverse events will be recorded and assessed according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, Version 5.0)., within 2 years after infusion
Overall response rate(ORR) of administering AT19 cells in Relapsed/Refractory CD19+ B-cell hematological malignancies., ORR will be assessed from CAR T cell infusion to death or last follow-up (censored)., within 2 years after infusion|Complete response rate(CRR) of administering AT19 cells in Relapsed/Refractory CD19+ B-cell hematological malignancies., CRR will be assessed from CAR T cell infusion to death or last follow-up (censored)., within 2 years after infusion|Progress-free survival(PFS) of administering AT19 cells in Relapsed/Refractory CD19+ B-cell hematological malignancies., PFS will be assessed from CAR T cell infusion to death or last follow-up (censored)., 2 years after infusion|Duration of Response(DOR) of administering AT19 cells in Relapsed/Refractory CD19+ B-cell hematological malignancies., DOR will be assessed from CAR T cell infusion to death or last follow-up (censored)., 2 years after infusion|Overall survival(OS) of administering AT19 cells in Relapsed/Refractory CD19+ B-cell hematological malignancies., OS will be assessed from CAR T cell infusion to death or last follow-up (censored)., 2 years after infusion
In vivo expansion and survival of AT19 cells, Quantity of AT19 CAR copies in bone marrow and peripheral blood will be determined by using qPCR., 2 years after infusion
* Adoptive transfer of autologous anti-CD19 CAR-T cells can induce durable remissions in patients with relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancies, including CD19+ B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia(B-ALL), B-cell chronic lymphoblastic leukemia(B-CLL), and B-cell lymphoma.
* However, multiple challenges exist for manufacturing CAR-T cells from patients with advanced disease including inability to manufacture a product, disease progression or death while waiting for the CAR-T product to be available, and heterogeneity among autologous CAR-T products that contributes to unpredictable and variable clinical activity.
* Healthy donor T cells can provide a source for production of universal CAR-T cells when combined with gene editing to prevent expression of endogenous TCRs and avoid generation of GvHD in HLA mismatched recipients.
* Cord blood derived T cells from healthy donor are the source for production of universal anti-CD19 CAR-modified AT19 cells. CRISPR/cas9 gene-editing technology has been used to knockout TCRs and HLA-I to avoid GvHD and transplant rejection.
* AT19 cells have exhibited potent cytotoxicity in CD19+ tumor cells and can effectively eradicate CD19+ tumor cells in xenograft mice models, without showing GvHD.
* This study aims to evaluate prelimary safety and efficacy of the universal AT19 cells in patients with relapsed/refractory B-ALL, B-CLL, and B-cell lymphoma.
