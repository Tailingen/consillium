Efficacy and Safety of GTx-024 in Patients With Estrogen Receptor (ER)+/Androgen Receptor (AR)+ Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine if GTx-024 at different dosages (9 mg or 18 mg) is effective and safe in the treatment of patients with metastatic or locally advanced Estrogen Receptor (ER)+ and Androgen Receptor (AR)+ breast cancer in postmenopausal women.
ER+ and AR+ Breast Cancer
DRUG: GTx-024
Clinical Benefit Rate, in Centrally Confirmed Androgen Receptor (AR)+ Subjects, To estimate the clinical benefit rate (defined as complete response, partial response, or stable disease) according to RECIST 1.1, in subjects with estrogen receptor positive/androgen receptor positive (ER+/AR+) BC who have centrally confirmed AR+ status. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions assessed by CT or MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR; Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR)= CR + PR + SD., 24 weeks
Clinical Benefit Rate, in Full Analysis Set, To estimate the clinical benefit response rate in all subjects randomized who receive at least one dose of study medication (the FAS) regardless of AR status as determined by the central laboratory. o estimate the clinical benefit rate (defined as complete response, partial response, or stable disease) according to RECIST 1.1, in subjects with estrogen receptor positive/androgen receptor positive (ER+/AR+) BC who have centrally confirmed AR+ status. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions assessed by CT or MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR; Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR)= CR + PR + SD., 24 weeks|Objective Response (CR + PR) in AR+ Patients, To estimate the clinical benefit rate (defined as complete response, partial response, or stable disease) according to RECIST 1.1, in subjects with estrogen receptor positive/androgen receptor positive (ER+/AR+) BC who have centrally confirmed AR+ status. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions assessed by CT or MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR; Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR)= CR + PR + SD., 24 weeks|Best Overall Response in AR+ Patients, To estimate the best overall response of GTx-024 9 mg and 18 mg, From treatment initiation to end of treatment|Progression Free Survival in All Subjects, To estimate the progression free survival of subjects receiving Gtx-024 9 mg and 18 mg. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions. Subjects were assessed up through 24 months., From randomization to tumor progression or death|Time to Progression in All Subjects, To estimate the time to progression in subjects receiving Gtx-024 9 mg and 18 mg in all subjects. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions. Time to progression was assessed up through 24 months., From randomization to tumor progression or death
Number Subjects Experiencing Adverse Events, To describe the safety profile of GTx-024 9 mg and 18 mg in all subjects randomized and treated. Reported adverse events were described by system organ class (SOC) as opposed to individual events, Up to 24 months
The purpose of this study is to determine if GTx-024 at different dosages (9 mg or 18 mg) is effective and safe in the treatment of patients with metastatic or locally advanced Estrogen Receptor (ER)+ and Androgen Receptor (AR)+ breast cancer in postmenopausal women.
