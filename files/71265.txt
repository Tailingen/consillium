This exploratory project is a prospective and multicenter study designed to evaluate the mechanisms of primary and acquired resistance to Kadcyla in a cohort of 50 progressive/recurrent HER2+ BC patients planned to be treated with Kadcyla within the approved indication in Spain.

This study will collect high quality molecular data derived from the analysis of serial biological samples (primary tumor and/or metastatic tissue, plasma, serum and whole blood samples), together with annotated clinical follow up, to reach a better understanding of the biological events that drive breast cancer progression and response/resistance to Kadcyla in ABC patients.
