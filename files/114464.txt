Study C4161001 is a Phase 1, open label, multi dose, multi center, dose escalation, safety, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic study of PF-07104091 in adult patients with advanced or metastatic small cell lung cancer (SCLC), advanced platinum resistant epithelial ovarian cancer/fallopian tube cancer/primary peritoneal cancer, locally recurrent/advanced or metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), HR-positive HER2-negative advanced or mBC, advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This two part study will assess the safety and tolerability of increasing dose levels of PF-07104091 in Part 1, and establish the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) in Part 2.
