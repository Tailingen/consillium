A Post-treatment Program to Identify and Manage Complications Related to Oncology or Hematology Treatments in Cancer Survivors.
INTRODUCTION: Approximately 44% of cancer survivors experience a deteriorated quality of life 5 years after diagnosis due to late onset of complications related to cancer treatments. The objective of the study is to evaluate the incidence rates of treatment-related complications, identify sub-clinical abnormalities and risk factors in patients participating in the PASCA post-treatment program.

METHOD: PASCA is a single-center, interventional cohort study of adult patients who received at least chemotherapy and with a complete remission to a testicular germ cell tumor, primary non-metastatic invasive breast carcinoma, high-grade soft tissue sarcoma, osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, acute myeloid leukemia, Hodgkin's or aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Four assessment visits will be scheduled at 1 month (T1), 6 months (T2), 24 months (T3) and 60 months (T4) after completion of treatment. During these visits, 22 complications will be screened and follow-up care will be systematically offered to the health professional concerned by the complication in case of a positive result. The screening will contain the following elements: screening self-questionnaires, quality of life questionnaire, 12 biological parameters, a urinalysis evaluating hematuria, proteinuria, and leukocyturia, a spirometry, an electrocardiogram, 5 tests evaluating physical condition, vital signs and the perimetric measurement between both arms.

DISCUSSION: This systematic screening could highlight a number of complications occurring after cancer treatments. Sub-clinical abnormalities and new risk factors could also be identified. This new organization of care could improve the quality of life of adult cancer survivors.
