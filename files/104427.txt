Genetic Counseling for Breast Cancer Survivors (GC for BC)
The purpose of this study is to review and evaluate the effectiveness of new educational materials (informational booklet \& DVD) that promote participation in genetic counseling among breast cancer survivors.

There are two phases to this study:

Part 1 - reviewing the newly developed educational materials, and Part 2 - evaluating the effectiveness of the newly developed educational materials
Breast Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Video and Booklet|BEHAVIORAL: Factsheet
Part 1: Rate of Initial Survey Responses, Intervention Development: Rate of feedback of draft materials required to complete a formative evaluation., Up to 8 months|Part 2: Rate of Participation, Participation in the Psychoeducational Intervention (PEI) group compared to the Factsheet group., Up to 8 months
Rate of Impact, Self-Reported Feedback Scoring Method: Frequencies and descriptives will be calculated for response options. Positive feedback rate of Psychoeducational Intervention (PEI) group compared to the Factsheet group., Up to 8 months
Part 1: Intervention Development

Aim 1: Develop a psychoeducational intervention (PEI) for high-risk breast cancer survivors about genetic counseling (GC) and hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC).

Part 2: Intervention Pilot

Aim 2: Assess the feasibility and acceptability of a PEI from the perspective of the BC patients and health care professionals.

Exploratory Aim 3: Estimate the preliminary efficacy of the PEI compared to standard clinical care. We hypothesize that women in the intervention group will have higher uptake of GC, greater increases in knowledge, and more perceived benefits related to GC compared to the control group.
