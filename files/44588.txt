The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of ponatinib in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase (CP), accelerated phase (AP) or blast phase (BP) or with Ph positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who either are resistant or intolerant to either dasatinib or nilotinib, or have the T315I mutation.
