Study of Valemetostat Tosylate as a Single Agent in Patients With Relapse/Refractory B-cell Lymphoma
This is a multicenter, prospective, single arm, non-randomized, open-label, phase 2 clinical study to evaluate safety and efficacy of valemetostat tosylate (DS-3201b) in patients with relapsed or refractory B cell lymphoma with 6 cohorts of patients including 2 biology-driven cohorts. Up to 141 patients will be enrolled in 6 different cohorts (40 patients with aggressive B-cell lymphoma, 41 with follicular lymphoma (FL), 20 with Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) and 20 with other indolent lymphomas, and 20 patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL)). FL patients with EZH2 mutant (gain of function mutations) will be enrolled in the cohort 2bis. At least 8 aggressive B-cell lymphoma patients with EZH2 mutant will be enrolled in the cohort 1. The primary endpoint is the overall response rate (ORR) determined by investigator assessment.
Lymphoma, B-Cell
DRUG: Valemetostat tosylate
Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR according to Lugano Response Criteria (2014), when mature response rate data have been observed, estimated as no later than 12 months after the last patient in each cohort has received the first dose of study drug

Each cycle consists of 28 days. Valemetostat tosylate (DS-3201b) is given continuously at 200 mg once daily (QD). The total duration is expected to be approximately 3 years, assuming an expected enrollment duration of 2 years and a minimum duration of valemetostat tosylate (DS- 3201b) administration of 12 cycles of 28 days for the last enrolled patient.
