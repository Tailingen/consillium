Clinical Study of EBV-TCR-T Cells for EBV-associated Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis or EBV Infection
This is a multi-center, single arm, open-label, phase I study to determine the safety and effectiveness of EBV-TCR-T cell immunotherapy in treating EBV-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (EBV-HLH) or EBV infection
EBV-associated Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis|EBV Infection

Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), Toxic effects considered by the investigators to be related to the EBV-TCR-T, 28 days after EBV-TCR-T treatment|Maximum tolerated dose （MTD）, The highest dose of DLT was seen in 1/6 of subjects, 28 days after EBV-TCR-T treatment|The proportion of EBV-DNA negative patients, The proportion of patients EBV-DNA negative after EBV-TCR-T treatment, 180 days after EBV-TCR-T treatment|The time to EBV-DNA negative, The time from the start of therapy to EBV-DNA negative detected, 180 days after EBV-TCR-T treatment|Changes of EBV-DNA copies number, Quantitative PCR will be used to determine viral copy numbers in peripheral blood., 1 year after EBV-TCR-T treatment|Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of EBV-TCR-T cells, Cmax of EBV-TCR-T cells in patients with EBV-HLH or EBV infection, 28 days after EBV-TCR-T treatment|Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) of EBV-TCR-T cells, AUC of EBV-TCR-T cells in patients with EBV-HLH or EBV infection, 28 days after EBV-TCR-T treatment|Time to peak (Tmax) of EBV-TCR-T cells, Tmax of EBV-TCR-T cells in patients with EBV-HLH or EBV infection, 28 days after EBV-TCR-T treatment|Half life time (T1/2) of EBV-TCR-T cells, T1/2 of EBV-TCR-T cells in patients with EBV-HLH or EBV infection, 28 days after EBV-TCR-T treatment
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a widely disseminated herpesvirus that is spread by intimate contact between susceptible persons and asymptomatic EBV shedders. The inability to control EBV infection can lead to some patients developing EBV-positive B-cell lymphomas, chronic active EBV infections, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). In this prospective study, HLA-A\*02:01/11:01/24:02-restricted EBV-specific T cell receptor (TCR) will be introduced into the T cells of donors by ex vivo lentiviral transduction to generate EBV-TCR-T cells. An escalated dose ranging from 1×10\^6/kg to 1×10\^8/kg of EBV-TCR-T cells will be infused into patients with EBV-HLH or EBV infection. The safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics and cytokine levels of allogenic EBV-TCR-T cell therapy will be evaluated.
