Vaccine Therapy and Sargramostim After Rituximab in Treating Patients With Refractory or Progressive Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Vaccines made from a person's cancer cells may make the body build an immune response to kill cancer cells. Colony-stimulating factors such as sargramostim may increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of rituximab followed by vaccine therapy and sargramostim in treating patients who have refractory or progressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: autologous immunoglobulin idiotype-KLH conjugate vaccine|BIOLOGICAL: sargramostim
Progression-free survival (PFS) in groups I and II and median PFS by Kaplan-Meier curves quarterly for 1 year and then twice a year after study completion
Immune response rates in patients who received at least 4 immunizations by anti-idiotype antibody and anti-KLH antibody assays during every other immunization, last immunization, 2 and 8 weeks post immunization, and then quarterly for 1 year|Clinical response in patients who received at least 1 immunization in groups I and II by modified Cheson criteria post-immunization and then every 6 months for 1 year|Safety at the start of immunization, every 8 weeks during immunization, 2 and 8 weeks post immunization, and then quarterly for 1 year
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine progression-free survival in patients with refractory or progressive follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with immediate or delayed autologous immunoglobulin idiotype-KLH conjugate vaccine and sargramostim after rituximab (groups I and II).
* Determine the immune response rate in patients treated with these regimens (groups I, II, and III).
* Determine the safety and toxicity of these regimens in these patients (groups I, II, and III).

OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study for patients previously registered on and confirmed ineligible for randomization in protocol Genitope-G2000-03.

Patients receive rituximab IV weekly for 4 weeks.

* Group I: The first 30 patients to achieve and maintain a partial response (PR) or better receive autologous immunoglobulin idiotype-KLH conjugate vaccine subcutaneously (SC) on day 1 and sargramostim SC on days 1-4 beginning 26 weeks after the last dose of rituximab. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 14 weeks (8 immunizations).
* Group II: All subsequent patients who achieve a PR or better receive autologous immunoglobulin idiotype-KLH conjugate vaccine and sargramostim SC as in group I beginning 13 weeks after the last dose of rituximab.
* Group III: Patients who are not eligible for group I or II and, in the investigator's opinion, are suitable candidates for immunization with autologous immunoglobulin idiotype-KLH conjugate vaccine and sargramostim SC receive the same treatment as groups I and II, beginning no more than 1 year after the last (fourth) dose of rituximab.

In all groups, treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or emergence of an illness that may interfere with study assessments.

Patients are followed for initial response 8 weeks after completion of immunizations and then every 12 weeks for an additional year. Thereafter, all immunized patients will be followed every 6 months until receipt of first subsequent anti-lymphoma therapy.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 120 patients will be accrued for this study.
