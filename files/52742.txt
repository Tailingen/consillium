New Adjuvant Vaccine in Glioblastoma, a Phase 1/2a Study
This phase I/II trial evaluates the safety and the immunological efficacy of a cancer vaccine against 2 glioma-associated antigens in newly-diagnosed glioblastomas. All patients enrolled in the study will receive standard treatment consisting of surgical resection of the tumor followed by radio-chemotherapy. Immunotherapy will begin 4 weeks after the completion of radiotherapy.
Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma
BIOLOGICAL: immunization
safety/efficacy, - phase 1: to assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), 12 months|safety/efficacy, - phase 2a : to assess anti-PTPRZ1/ TERT specific T cell responses, 2 months
Overall survival, The time interval from the start of treatment to the date of death from any cause., 12 months|Progression free survival, Tumor response will be assessed using RANO 2.0 criteria, 12 months|the evaluation of quality of life, EORTC-QLQC30 questionnaire and BN20 module will be completed by each patient (Not all= 1; A little=2; Quite a bit= 3 ; Very Much=4), 5 months
This therapeutic vaccine targeting 2 identified glioma-associated antigens (TERT and PTPRZ1) is based on a new formulation that contains synthetic melanin and a TLR9 agonist, which is caable to induce strong cellular immune responses.

One month after glioblastoma patients have completed the initial phase of treatment with concurrent radiochemotherapy, patients will be immunized during the adjuvant phase of monthly temozolomide. Immunizations will follow the standard schedule of a priming phase (D0, W2, W4, and W6) followed by a boost phase with one immunization every 2 months for a total of 12 months.

Phase 1: subcutaneous injections at one of 3 pre-specified dose levels of peptides Phase 2a: subcutaneous injections at the dose selected in the phase 1 part. Safety will be evaluated clinically and with blood samples at each treatment visit. Efficacy will be assessed with anti-PTPRZ1 and anti-TERT specific T cell responses in peripheral blood, and with cerebral MRI every other months
