HR Versus RFA for Early Stage HCC
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading death cancer in the world. It is important to explore a safe and effective therapy for early-stage HCC. Previous studies reported that radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has higher efficacy and is associated with fewer complications and shorter hospital stays than hepatic resection (HR) for early-stage HCC. However, meta-analysis and systematic review found that RFA is associated with higher recurrence rate and lower long-term overall survival.
