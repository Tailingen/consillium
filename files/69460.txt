A Phase IIa Clinical Study of Purinostat Mesylate for Injection in Patients With Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma and Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma
Primary Objective To evaluate the preliminary efficacy of Purinostat Mesylate for Injection in patients with relapsed or refractory Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma (PTCL) and Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma (CTCL).

Secondary Objectives

1. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of Purinostat Mesylate for Injection in patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL and CTCL.
2. To evaluate the population pharmacokinetic characteristics of Purinostat Mesylate for Injection in patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL and CTCL.

Exploratory Objective To investigate the relationship between tumor biomarkers and the therapeutic efficacy/safety profile of Purinostat Mesylate for Injection.

Objective remission rate (ORR), Defined as the proportion of subjects with an overall efficacy response of complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR) after at least one post-baseline evaluation during the trial period, Evaluated every two cycles (Each cycle is 21 days)
Complete Remission Rate (CRR), Defined as the proportion of subjects with an overall efficacy response of CR after at least one post-baseline evaluation during the trial;, Evaluated every two cycles (Each cycle is 21 days)|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Defined as the proportion of subjects with an overall efficacy response of CR, PR, and stable disease (SD) after at least one post-baseline evaluation during the trial;, Evaluated every two cycles (Each cycle is 21 days)|Duration of remission (DOR), Duration of first remission (PR or CR) to disease progression or death;, Evaluated every two cycles (Each cycle is 21 days)|Time to Tumor Remission (TTR), Time from first dose to the onset of remission, Evaluated every two cycles (Each cycle is 21 days)|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Defined as the time from the first administration of the drug to disease progression or death (whichever occurs first)., Week 96|Overall Survival (OS), Defined as the time from the first administration of the drug to death (due to any cause)., Week 96
