Study for AZD4360 in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumours
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, immunogenicity, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of AZD4360 in adult participants with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours selected for expression of CLDN18.2.

DRUG: AZD4360
Incidence of participants with Dose-Limiting Toxicity (in dose escalation cohort), Adverse events (AEs) , Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and AEs leading to discontinuation of AZD4360, To investigate the safety and tolerability, and to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and/or a Recommended Phase II Dose (R2PD) of AZD4360 in previously treated participants with advanced solid tumours, through the assessment of Dose Limiting Toxicities, Adverse Events and Severe Adverse Events., Through study completion, up to approximately 2 years
