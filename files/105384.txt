Pilot Study of Intervention to Reduce Sunburns in Melanoma Survivors
This project will pilot test whether a wearable device that tracks sun exposure and provides alerts regarding sun exposure and protection behaviors will reduce sunburns in melanoma survivors. The use of wearable technology devices has grown quickly over the last decade and studies using these devices to promote physical activity and weight loss have been promising. The investigators will pilot test the technology device versus a similar control device in 80 melanoma survivors and compare sunburns between the two groups after the three month intervention.
