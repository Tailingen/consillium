Phase 1 Study of MGD007 in Relapsed/Refractory Metastatic Colorectal Carcinoma
The primary goal of this Phase 1 study is to characterize the safety and tolerability of MGD007 and establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and schedule of MGD007 administered to patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma. Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and the anti-tumor activity of MGD007 will also be assessed.
Colorectal Carcinoma
DRUG: MGD007
Characterize dose limiting toxicity and establish a maximum tolerated dose and schedule, Safety is based on evaluation of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) from the time of study drug administration through the End of Study visit. The MTD will be defined separately for both the weekly and every three week schedules of MGD007 administration, and will be determined as the highest dose level at which the incidence of DLT is \< 33% during the first cycle of MGD007 treatment., Cycle 1 of a 6 week cycle
Characterize the PK and Immunogenicity of MGD007, Serum concentrations of MGD007 will be monitored. PK modeling will be performed and an appropriate model will be selected to describe the data., Beginning of treatment through end of treatment, an expected duration of less than 12 months|Describe any evidence of anti-tumor activity, Obtain regular radiographic and clinical evaluations to assess treatment response., Every 6 weeks until End of Study, an expected duration of less than 12 months
This is an open-label, multi-center, Phase 1 dose-escalation study to define a MTD, describe preliminarily safety, and to assess PK, immunogenicity, and potential anti-tumor activity of MGD007 in patients with relapsed or refractory metastatic colorectal cancer.

In the initial phase of the study, two dose schedules will be assessed in dose escalation, once weekly and once every three weeks administration of single agent MGD007. Following the establishment of an MTD, additional patients will enroll in four separate dose expansion cohorts to further optimize the dose and schedule of MGD007 administration.

In all segments of the study, patients who benefit from MGD007 treatment and continue to meet eligibility may continue treatment in Cycles 2 and beyond.
