Patients with a recent diagnosis and treatment of a brain tumor (primary or metastatic; N=105, 61% female, 39% male) were identified in the clinics of Semmes-Murphey Neurologic and Spine Institute or the Methodist University Hospital in Memphis, TN. Caregivers were recruited from among relatives and friends who provide the most day-to-day care to the patient. All participants were between 3 months and 1 year from their most recent brain tumor treatment. Participants were given a simple, 5-point based survey to asses treatment-specific satisfaction, patient education, posttreatment quality of life, and pre- and post-treatment emotional impact. Therapeutic modalities surveyed include: surgery, external beam radiotherapy, whole-brain radiotherapy, stereotactic radiosurgery, and chemotherapy.
