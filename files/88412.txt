Robotic-arm Assisted 68 Ga PSMA PET/CT Guided Prostate Biopsy Versus MR Directed TRUS Guided Prostate Biopsy
The present study aimed to compare the diagnostic accuracy, radiation exposure, complication rates between 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT guided robotic arm assisted prostate biopsy and MRI directed TRUS guided prostate biopsy.
Prostate Cancer|Prostate Neoplasm
PROCEDURE: PSMA PET guided prostate biopsy|PROCEDURE: MRI directed TRUS guided prostate biopsy
Diagnostic yield of mpMRI directed vs PET/CT directed prostate biopsy, The number of participants (with percentages) in whom the biopsy procedure yielded a tissue specimen adequate for a definite pathological diagnosis will be tabulated., 12 months|Diagnostic performance of mpMRI directed vs PET/CT directed prostate biopsy, The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of mpMR directed TRUS guided (cognitive fusion) and PSMA PET/CT directed biopsy will be compared., 12 months
Incidence of procedure related complications, The procedure-related complications in the number and percentage of recruiting participants will be tabulated., three months
To compare the diagnostic yield of Robotic-arm assisted 68Ga PSMA PET/CT guided prostate biopsy and MRI directed TRUS guided prostate biopsy in patients with PIRADS grading 4/5.

To compare the visual pain index of the patients between two arms during the procedure.

To compare the complication rates between the two arms during and after the procedure for a period of 2 weeks
