The Selective Personalized Radio-Immunotherapy for Locally Advanced NSCLC Trial
The goal of this study is to explore if, for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients whose tumors have high levels of PD-L1 (a marker associated with benefits from immunotherapy), a combination of immunotherapy and a personalized 4-week radiotherapy course could be more effective than standard treatment, which is a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer, NSCLC
DRUG: PembroRT
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), To characterize progression-free survival (PFS) rates following treatment with sequential pembrolizumab and radiotherapy for locally advanced NSCLC with PD-L1 expression ≥ 50%, the percentage of participants with PFS at 12 months will be reported., 12 months
Freedom From Distant Metastasis, To characterize freedom from distant metastases following treatment with sequential pembrolizumab and radiotherapy for locally advanced NSCLC with PD-L1 expression ≥ 50%, cumulative incidence was calculated treating other events as competing risks. Competing risks are those events which prevent the occurrence or modify the risk of the outcome of distant metastasis. For this study, cumulative incidence is defined as the percentage of patients free from distant metastases up to 18 months following completion of treatment / number of people at risk in the study population and is reported as a percentage., Up to 18 months following completion of treatment, up to 30 months total|Intrathoracic Disease Progression, To characterize freedom from intrathoracic disease progression rates following treatment with sequential pembrolizumab and radiotherapy for locally advanced NSCLC with PD-L1 expression ≥ 50%, the cumulative incidence rate will be determined using competing risk analysis. For this study, intrathoracic disease progression will be reported as a percentage of patients., Up to 18 months following completion of treatment, up to 30 months total|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) of patients alive at 1 year and 2 years following treatment with sequential pembrolizumab and radiotherapy for locally advanced NSCLC with PD-L1 expression ≥ 50% was analyzed. OS was defined as the percentage of treated participants who were still alive at 1 year or 2 years following completion of treatment, divided by the total number of treated participants, multiplied by 100. Overall survival was censored at the time of the last clinic visit or contact., 1 year and 2 years following completion of treatment, up to 3 years total|Radiographic Response Rate Based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), Radiographic Response will be scored using RECIST V1.1 criteria to quantify objective measures of change in tumor burden. Although RECIST 1.1 references a maximum of 5 target lesions in total and 2 per organ, the Sponsor allows a maximum of 10 target lesions in total and 5 per organ, if clinically relevant to enable a broader sampling of tumor burden. RECIST will be used to quantify the percentage of patients demonstrating Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), Stable Disease (SD), Progressive Disease (PD), as follows:

CR - resolution of all target lesions to background levels PR - at least 30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions (noting baseline diameters) SD - neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR or sufficient increase to qualify for PD (noting smallest sum on study) PD - at least 20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions (noting smallest sum on study); absolute increase of 5mm must be demonstrated; \>=1 new lesion is considered PD, 2 months|Unplanned Hospitalization Rate, The unplanned hospitalization rate will be determined as the percentage of participants hospitalized due to treatment-related toxicities., Up to 18 months following completion of treatment, up to 30 months total
This is a Phase II trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of sequential pembrolizumab (200 mg every three weeks) and accelerated, dose-painted radiotherapy for patients with locally advanced NSCLC with PD-L1 expression ≥ 50%. Patients with PD-L1 expression \< 50% will be treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy as part of standard of care.
