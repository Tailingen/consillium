Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Imaging in Stage III Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (PET START Trial)
Locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer, NSCLC, (Stage III) is potentially curable with aggressive combined modality therapy (chemotherapy and radiation). Conventional imaging can only evaluate gross anatomic abnormalities but functional imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) may more accurately identify patients who will benefit from aggressive combined modality therapy.

This prospective randomized clinical trial will enroll 400 patients that have undergone conventional staging for lung cancer and have been found to have Stage III NSCLC. The patients will then be randomized to either standard combined modality therapy for Stage III NSCLC or to PET imaging prior to combined modality therapy with curative intent. Based on the PET findings, patients will either be suitable for combined modality therapy with curative intent or not.
