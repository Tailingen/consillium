Novel BCMA-targeted CAR-T Cell Therapy for Multiple Myeloma
This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of novel BCMA-targeted CAR-T cell therapy (CBG-002) for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (r/r MM). CBG-002 is designed based on the fourth-generation of CAR-T techonology.
Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
BIOLOGICAL: anti-BCMA CAR-T|DRUG: Cyclophosphamid|DRUG: Fludarabine
Rate of grade 3 or 4 treatment related adverse effect, All the CAR-T treatment related adverse eventsï¼Œincluding Dose limiting toxicity (DLT), cytokine release syndrome (CRS), CAR-T associated encephalopathy syndrome, will be assessed and graded by NCI CTCAE v 5.0., 24 weeks after last dose of CAR-T treatment|Overall response rate (ORR) after treated by CAR-T treatment, ORR will be assessed and graded by the international Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Unified response criteria for multiple myeloma, up to 2 years after CAR-T treatment
Pharmacokinetics of CAR-T cells (implantation endpoint), To assess the duration of CAR-positive T cells in circulation, the copy number of CAR DNA was measured at the preset follow-up time point. The time when the results of any two consecutive tests were negative, were recorded as the "implantation endpoint"., up to 2 years after CAR-T treatment|Overall survival, From date of inclusion to date of progression, relapse, or death from any cause., up to 2 years after CAR-T treatment|Progression free survival, The length of time that a participant's disease did not progress during and after CAR-T treatment., up to 2 years after CAR-T treatment
