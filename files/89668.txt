Dose Escalation and Expansion Study of BH3120 Alone or With Pembrolizuamb in Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is a First-in-Human, Phase 1, Dose-Escalation and Dose-Expansion study of BH3120, as a single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab, to assess safety, tolerability, MTD, RP2D, PK, and efficacy in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Dose-Escalation part is planned to establish the MTD or RD for Dose-Expansion part, while Dose-Expansion part is designed to assess potential efficacy of BH3120, as a single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab, when administered at the RD to subjects in indication-specific expansion cohorts.
