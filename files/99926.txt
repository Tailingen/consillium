A Study of Venetoclax in Combination With Bendamustine + Rituximab or Bendamustine + Obinutuzumab in Participants With Relapsed/Refractory or Previously Untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)
This multi-center, open-label, dose-finding study will evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of venetoclax (GDC-0199, ABT-199) administered in combination with bendamustine and rituximab (BR) (MabThera/Rituxan) or bendamustine and obinutuzumab (BG) to participants with first-line (1L)/previously untreated or relapsed/refractory (R/R) chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The study will explore two venetoclax combination regimens in participants with 1L CLL: BR+venetolax (V) and BG+V. Participants with R/R CLL will be administered BR+V.

CR requires all of the following: Peripheral blood lymphocytes below 4x10\^9/L, absence of lymphadenopathy by physical examination and computed tomography (CT) scan, No hepatomegaly or splenomegaly, Absence of disease or constitutional symptoms, Blood counts of neutrophils \>1.5\*10\^9/L, platelets \>100\*10\^9/L and hemoglobin \>110 g/L, Bone marrow at least normocellular for age without clonal infiltrate (except for Cri). PR: two of the following features for at least 2 months: \>/= 50% decrease in peripheral blood lymphocyte count from the pretreatment value, \>/=50% reduction in lymphadenopathy, \>/=50% reduction of liver and/or spleen enlargement, and at least one of the following blood counts: neutrophils \>1.5\*10\^9/L, platelets \>100\*10\^9/L and hemoglobin \>110 g/L., Baseline up to approximately 5.75 years|Duration of Response According to IWCLL 2008 Guidelines, CR or CR with incomplete bone marrow recovery (CRi) or PR or nodular PR (nPR) was determined by the investigator according to IWCLL 2008 criteria. CR requires all of the following: Peripheral blood lymphocytes below 4x10\^9/L, absence of lymphadenopathy by physical examination and computed tomography (CT) scan, No hepatomegaly or splenomegaly, Absence of disease or constitutional symptoms, Blood counts of neutrophils \>1.5\*10\^9/L, platelets \>100\*10\^9/L and hemoglobin \>110 g/L, Bone marrow at least normocellular for age without clonal infiltrate (except for Cri).

CR requires all of the following: Peripheral blood lymphocytes below 4x10\^9/L, absence of lymphadenopathy by physical examination and computed tomography (CT) scan, No hepatomegaly or splenomegaly, Absence of disease or constitutional symptoms, Blood counts of neutrophils \>1.5\*10\^9/L, platelets \>100\*10\^9/L and hemoglobin \>110 g/L, Bone marrow at least normocellular for age without clonal infiltrate (except for Cri)., Baseline up to approximately 5.75 years|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) According to IWCLL 2008 Guidelines, PFS was determined according to IWCLL 2008 criteria and defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of progressive disease (PD) or death. Disease progression was characterized by at least one of the following: 1) \>/= 50% increase in the absolute number of circulating lymphocytes to at least 5\*10\^9/L, 2) Appearance of new palpable lymph nodes (\> 15 mm in longest diameter) or any new extra-nodal lesion; 3) \>/= 50% increase in the longest diameter of any previous site of lymphadenopathy; 4) \>/= 50% increase in the enlargement of the liver and/or spleen; 5) Transformation to a more aggressive histology., Baseline up to approximately 5.75 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause., Baseline up to approximately 5.75 years|Number of Participants With Adverse Events, An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events., Up to approximately 5.75 years
