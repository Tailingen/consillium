Progression-free survival (PFS), To assess progression-free survival of patients treated with target treatment according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 by investigator, define as first dose to first documented disease progression assessed by investigator or death due to any cause., Time from first subject dose to study completion, or up to 36 month
Overall survival (OS), To assess overall survival, define as first dose to the death of the subject due to any cause, To assess overall survival, define as first dose to the death of the subject due to any cause up to 5 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR), To assess progression-free survival of patients treated with target treatment according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 by investigator, define as first dose to first documented disease progression assessed by investigator or death due to any cause., Time from first subject dose to study completion, or up to 36 month|Adverse events (AEs) according to CTCAE 5.0, Number of participants with adverse events (AEs) according to CTCAE 5.0, From first dose until 28 days after the last dose, up to 24 month|Patient reported outcome (PRO), Patient reported outcome defined as the quality of life during the whole process treatment., To assess overall survival, define as first dose to the death of the subject due to any cause up to 5 years
The purpose of this study is to assess the Treatment Strategies and Survival Outcome for Non-small Cell Lung Cancer With Oncogenic Mutation.

Our study was set up with several group with EGFR mutant, ALK fusion, ROS1 fusion, RET fusion, BRAF mutation, NRG1 fusion, MET alteration, KRAS mutation, etc.
