Sotatercept in Treating Patients With Myeloproliferative Neoplasm-Associated Myelofibrosis or Anemia
This phase II trial studies the side effects of and how well sotatercept works in treating patients with myeloproliferative neoplasm-associated myelofibrosis or anemia. Sotatercept may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
Anemia|Myelodysplastic/Myeloproliferative Neoplasm|Myelofibrosis
BIOLOGICAL: Sotatercept|DRUG: Ruxolitinib
Anemia-response, Defined as an increase in hemoglobin level equal to or greater than 1.5 g/L without red blood cell-transfusion OR becoming red blood cell-transfusion-independent in a patient who is red blood cell-transfusion-dependent. Will be based on the intent-to-treat principle., Up to 84 days|Duration of Response, Response date to loss of response or last follow up., Up to 9 years
The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if sotatercept can help to control MPN-associated myelofibrosis and anemia. The safety of this drug will also be studied.

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

Patients receive sotatercept subcutaneously (SC) once every 3 weeks. Cycles repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients unable to achieve anemia-response after 8 cycles will be taken off study.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month.
