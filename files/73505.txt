Incidence of Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), A dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as an adverse event or abnormal laboratory value of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade ≥ 3 assessed as unrelated to disease, disease progression, inter-current illness or concomitant medications, which occurs within the DLT period. The DLT period for Schedule 1 is 28 days and covers two infusions. The DLT period for Schedule 2 and Schedule 3 is 35 days to cover two infusions of the Experimental dose. Other clinically significant toxicities may be considered to be DLTs, even if not CTCAE grade 3 or higher., Up to 35 days|Incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events during the on-treatment period, Number of participants with AEs (any AE regardless of seriousness) and SAEs, including changes from baseline in vital signs, electrocardiograms and laboratory results qualifying and reported as AEs.

Overall Response Rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1, ORR is the percentage of patients with a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), based on local investigator assessment per Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. For RECIST v1.1, CR=Disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions. In addition, any pathological lymph nodes assigned as target lesions must have a reduction in short axis to \< 10 mm; PR= At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameter of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters., Up to approximately 48 weeks (KAZ954 single agent), 16 weeks (KAZ954+PDR001) and 20 weeks (KAZ954+NIR178)|Overall Response Rate (ORR) per iRECIST, ORR is the percentage of patients with a best overall response of complete response (iCR) or partial response (iPR), based on local investigator assessment per immune-related RECIST (iRECIST).

In addition, any pathological lymph nodes assigned as target lesions must have a reduction in short axis to \< 10 mm; PR= At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameter of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters; SD= Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR or CR nor an increase in lesions which would qualify for progression., Up to approximately 48 weeks (KAZ954 single agent), 16 weeks (KAZ954+PDR001) and 20 weeks (KAZ954+NIR178)|Disease Control Rate (DCR) per iRECIST, DCR is the percentage of patients with a best overall response of complete response (iCR), partial response (iPR), stable disease (iSD), based on local investigator assessment per immune-related RECIST (iRECIST).

The purpose of this trial was to explore the clinical utility of several therapies in patients with advanced cancer.

This is a multi-center, open-label Phase I/Ib study. The study consisted of a dose escalation part and a dose expansion part testing KAZ954 as a single agent or KAZ954 in combination with PDR001, NZV930 and NIR178.

The dose escalation part estimated the MTD and/or RD and tested different dosing schedules. The dose escalation arm KAZ954 + NZV930 was not opened.

The dose expansion part of the study was planned to use the MTD/RDE determined in the dose escalation part to assess the activity, safety and tolerability of the investigational products in patients with specific types of cancer. The dose expansion part of the study was not started.
