Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiotherapy in Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor in adults. The treatment comprises maximal safe resection followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Despite appropriate management, 90% of the patients will develop relapse or progression. After progression, the median survival is 5.2 months (Stupp, 2009).

The treatment of GBM relapse remains investigational. Reirradiation is an option in selected cases.

The objective of this study is to compare 2 schemes of stereotactic hypofractionated radiotherapy in the management of recurrent GBM.
Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme
RADIATION: Stereotactic hypofractionated RT 5x5Gy|RADIATION: Stereotactic hypofractionated RT 5x7Gy
progression free survival, progression free survival as defined by the "Response Assesment in Neuro Oncology Working Group"(Wen, 2010). Briefly progression is defined as:

* increase in 25% of the product of perpendicular diameters of enhancing lesions
* significant increase in T2/Flair non enhancing component
* appearance of new lesions
* clinical deterioration not attributable to other causes other than the tumor or reduction in corticosteroid dose, from date of randomization until date of first documented progression or death from any cause, which ever comes first, assessed up to 48 months
overall survival, from date of randomization until death from any cause, assessed up to 48 months|local control, from date of randomization until date of local progression, assessed up to 48 months|toxicity, * toxicity scored by the Common Terminology of Adverse Events version 4
* will be assessed every 2 months or in case of patient hospitalization or visit to the E.R., from date of randomization until death, assessed up to 48 months|quality of life, * quality of life measured by the "FACT Br" questionary
* will be assessed every 2 months, from date of randomization until last follow-up, assessed up to a period of 48 months
