A Phase I Study of IGN523 in Subjects With Relapsed or Refractory AML
This study will examine the safety and tolerability of IGN523 administered as an IV infusion. The main purpose of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), which is the highest dose that does not cause unacceptable side effects of IGN523 in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The MTD will be determined by observing the dose-limiting toxicities (the side effects that prevent further increases in dose) of IGN523. In addition, the pharmacokinetic profile and anti-leukemia activity of IGN523 will be assessed. A recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of IGN523 will be identified, on the basis of safety, pharmacokinetic (PK), and pharmacodynamic (PD) data.

DRUG: IGN523
Incidence of adverse events, Through 1 month following last dose
Incidence of antidrug antibodies to IGN523, Through 6 months following last dose|Blood concentrations of IGN523, Through 6 months following last dose|Assess anti-leukemic activity of IGN523, Subjects with measurable disease will be assessed by standard criteria (Cheson). Subjects will be formally evaluated for response at the end of Cycle 2; additional evaluations may be performed during the study as clinical indicated., Initial assessment after 8 weeks of treatment
Primary Objectives:

* Evaluate the safety and tolerability of IGN523 administered weekly
* Determine the MTD and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of IGN523 when administered weekly during the DLT Evaluation Period
* Identify a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of IGN523 on the basis of safety, PK, and PD data

Secondary Objectives:

* Assess the incidence of antibody formation to IGN523
* Characterize the PK of IGN523 in subjects with relapsed or refractory AML
* Perform a preliminary assessment of the anti-leukemic activity of IGN523 in subjects with relapsed or refractory AML
* Perform a preliminary assessment of biologic markers that might predict IGN523 anti-leukemic activity
