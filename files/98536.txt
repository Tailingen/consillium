Reproductive Health Outcomes in Young Patients with Ovarian Cancer After Surgical Treatment: a Retrospective Study
Ovarian cancer (OC) is the second commonest gynecological cancer with an overall incidence of 1.4% , associated with high mortality rate , There are three major types of ovarian cancers: epithelial ovarian carcinomas, germ cell tumors, and stromal cell tumors .

Ovarian cancer directly affects fertility, as treatment consists of surgical removal of the reproductive system and/or exposure to gonadotoxic agents. However, patients in early stages who meet established criteria can be treated with fertility-sparing surgeries and reach equivalent oncological results to those of traditional treatments. Fertility preservation techniques such as cryopreservation of oocytes, embryos and ovarian tissue may also be offered in some situations.

Ovarian cancer (OC) has a high mortality rate and usually presents late in advanced stage, which poses challenges to management. Better understanding of the disease biology and application of radical surgery (RS) to achieve no visible residual tumor, alongside with chemotherapy, may lead to longer survival amongst these patients. Our purpose is to find out the fertility and survival rates of women with Overian Cancer in reproductive women who underwent surgical intervention. Radical Surgery for Overian cancer is one of the most challenging procedures in gynecologic oncology surgery.
