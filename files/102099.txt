A Study of Filanesib (ARRY-520) and Carfilzomib in Patients With Advanced Multiple Myeloma
This is a Phase 2 study during which patients with advanced multiple myeloma will receive either carfilzomib alone (single-agent) or carfilzomib in combination with investigational study drug filanesib (ARRY-520). Patients will be followed to determine the effectiveness of both single-agent carfilzomib and carfilzomib + filanesib in treating myeloma. Patients will be allowed to crossover from single-agent carfilzomib to carfilzomib + filanesib if disease progression occurs. Approximately 75 patients from the US will be enrolled in this study.
Advanced Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Carfilzomib, proteasome inhibitor; intravenous|DRUG: Filanesib, KSP(Eg5) inhibitor; intravenous|DRUG: Dexamethasone, steroid; oral or intravenous|DRUG: Filgrastim, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF); subcutaneous
Assess the efficacy of both carfilzomib + study drug and single-agent carfilzomib in terms of progression-free survival., 18 months
Assess the efficacy of both carfilzomib + study drug and single-agent carfilzomib in terms of objective response rate., 18 months|Assess the safety of both carfilzomib + study drug and single-agent carfilzomib in terms of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests and electrocardiograms., 18 months|Characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of study drug, carfilzomib and a carfilzomib metabolite in patients treated with carfilzomib + study drug in terms of plasma concentration-time profiles and model-based PK parameters., 6 months|Following crossover from single-agent carfilzomib, assess the efficacy of carfilzomib + study drug in terms of objective response rate., 18 months|Following crossover from single-agent carfilzomib, assess the safety of carfilzomib + study drug in terms of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests and electrocardiograms., 18 months
Evaluate patient serum levels of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) at Baseline and during the treatment period., 18 months
