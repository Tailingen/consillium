A Feasibility Phase II Study in the Treatment of Resected Cholangiocarcinoma, Gallbladder, Pancreatic and Ampullary Cancers
To assess the feasibility of administering induction chemotherapy with gemcitabine and docetaxel followed by concurrent radiation and continuous infusion 5FU and consolidation gemcitabine/docetaxel chemotherapy.
Cholangiocarcinoma Cancer|Gallbladder Cancer|Pancreatic Cancer|Ampullary Cancer
DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Docetaxel|RADIATION: Radiation
Incidence of Severe Toxicities, Toxicity was graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC) version 2.0, 1 month after completion of treatment (treatment lasts approximately 19 weeks)
Toxicities Associated With Treatment (Grade 1-2), Toxicity was graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC) version 2.0. The most common grade 1-2 non-hematologic and hematologic toxicities were collected for this outcome., 30 days after completion of treatment (treatment lasts approximately 19 weeks)|Toxicities Associated With Treatment (Grade 3-4), Toxicity was graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC) version 2.0. The most common grade 3-4 non-hematologic and hematologic toxicities were collected for this outcome., 30 days after completion of treatment (treatment lasts approximately 19 weeks)|Disease Free Survival (DFS) - Median, DFS was defined as the time from the initiation of treatment to relapse or death, whichever occurred first., Median follow-up was 24 months (range 3.2-97 months)|Overall Survival (OS) - Median, OS was defined as the time from the initiation of treatment to death from any cause or last follow-up., Median follow-up was 24 months (range 3.2-97 months)|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from the initiation of treatment to death from any cause or last follow-up, 1 year|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from the initiation of treatment to death from any cause or last follow-up, 2 years
