Canakinumab With Darbepoetin Alfa in PTs With Lower-Risk MDS Who Have Failed ESA
This study is a multi-institution, open-label, Phase 1b/2 clinical trial evaluating the toxicity and efficacy of canakinumab in combination with darbepoetin alfa in patients with lower-risk MDS who have failed prior treatment with an Erythropoietin Stimulating Agent (ESA)
Myelodysplastic Syndromes
DRUG: Canakinumab Injection|DRUG: Darbepoetin Alfa
Phase 1b: Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), Maximum tolerated Dose will be determined by testing increasing doses of canakinumab along with a fixed dose of darbepoetin alfa. Patients will be followed for at least 1 cycle before the safety of each cohort can be fully assessed and decisions made for dose escalation in the next cohort. The MTD is defined as the dose level below which DLT is manifested in â‰¥33% of the patients or at dose level 2 if DLT is manifested in \<33% of the patients (with at 6 patients treated at the MTD)., up to 28 days per cohort|Phase 2: Rate of Hematologic Improvement-Erythroid (HI-E) response, To determine the rate of hematologic improvement-erythroid (HI-E) response, defined as red blood cell transfusion independence (RBC-TI) of at least 8 weeks in transfusion dependent patients or a mean Hgb increase of \>/=1.5g/dL above baseline sustained for at least 8 weeks in non-transfusion dependent patients., 8 - 12 weeks from baseline
Phase 1b and Phase 2: Duration of Hematologic Improvement-Erythroid (HI-E) response, Duration of HI-E response: defined as the total duration for which patient is free from transfusions, or in non-transfusion dependent patients, the duration of sustained Hgb improvement of ./=1.5g/dL above pre-treatment baseline., Up to 12 months per cohort|Phase 1b and Phase 2: Degree in reduction of PRBC Transfusions, Degree in reduction of PRBC Transfusions: defined as the total reduction in absolute number of units of PRBCs transfused over the first 24 weeks on study versus the number of units of PRBCs during the 16 weeks prior to treatment, at 24 weeks per cohort|Phase 2: Overall Response Rate (ORR), Overall Response Rate (ORR) is defined by achieving a complete response (CR), partial response (PR), marrow CR (mCR) or hematologic improvement (HI) by IWG 2006 response criteria in MDS, Up to 60 months|Phase 2: Duration of Response, Duration of response is defined as the duration that begins on the day patient first achieves a response, until the day that patient loses response/progresses as per IWG criteria or dies., Up to 60 months|Phase 2: Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the duration of time starting from first treatment with canakinumab until death, Up to 60 months|Phase 2: Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the duration of time starting from first treatment with canakinumab until death or disease progression or transformation, as defined by IWG 2006 criteria., Up to 60 months
This study is a multi-institution, open-label, Phase 1b/2 clinical trial evaluating the toxicity and efficacy of canakinumab in combination with darbepoetin alfa in patients with lower-risk MDS who have failed prior treatment with an ESA. The study will be conducted in two parts, an initial Phase 1b dose escalation study followed by a dose expansion phase.
