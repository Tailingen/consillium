Allogeneic Natural Killer (NK) Cell Therapy in Patients With Lymphoma or Solid Tumor
Allogeneic natural killer (NK) cells (MG4101) were manufactured from normal healthy donor who underwent leukapheresis. These cells were processed based on a novel method for ex vivo activation and expansion using an irradiated and activated autologous feeder cell system. MG4101 has anti-tumor activities against various tumors including malignant lymphomas in vitro as well as in vivo tumor model.
Malignant Lymphomas|Solid Tumors
BIOLOGICAL: Allogeneic NK cells
To determine the MTD of allogenetic NK cells, DLT is defined as follows:

* Any toxicity at grade 3 or over for 5 days or more
* All grade 4 toxicities
* GVHD at grade 2 or over, 4-5 weeks
To determine the overall response rate, RECIST v1.1 for solid tumor or revised response criteria for malignant lymphoma, 4-5 weeks|To evaluate the safety, NCI-CTCAE v3.0, 4 -5 weeks|To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of allogeneic NK cells, To quantify the persistence of donor NK cells in recipients, 4-5 weeks
