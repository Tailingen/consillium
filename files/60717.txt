Impact of Surgical Management for Relapse After Conversion Hepatectomy for Initially Unresectable Colorectal Liver Metastasis
For patients with initially unresectable colorectal liver metastasis (IU-CRLM) receiving effective conversion therapy, disease relapse after conversion hepatectomy is common due to the extensive tumor load. Yet, few studies have focused on the assessment and management of relapse after conversion hepatectomy for IU-CRLM. This study aimed to investigate the impact of surgical management for relapse after conversion hepatectomy in IU-CRLM.
