The investigators aim to optimize implementation of opportunistic salpingectomy throughout the Netherlands. The investigators will evaluate the implementation by enrolling patients in a database to evaluate healthcare experiences and to register EOC diagnosis and vital status through yearly PALGA (the nationwide network and registry of histopathology and cytopathology in the Netherlands) and municipal administration searches. In addition, the investigators will perform medical record check to assess which percentage of eligible women have been offered OS.

The investigators expect that a decision aid will be a necessary tool for the decision whether women opt for an OS or not, based on their personal values. After development of the tool(s), the investigators will evaluate the implementation process.
