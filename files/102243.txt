Topotecan and Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Solid Tumors or Lymphoma
Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of topotecan and radiation therapy in treating patients who have solid tumors or lymphoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage cancer cells. Combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more cancer cells.

DRUG: topotecan hydrochloride|RADIATION: low-LET electron therapy|RADIATION: low-LET photon therapy
OBJECTIVES:

I. Define the maximum tolerated dose and safety profile of topotecan (TOPO) administered with daily high-dose thoracic radiotherapy to a total of 60 Gy in patients with solid tumor or lymphoma.

II. Assess the qualitative and quantitative nature of the toxic effects encountered in this treatment.

III. Estimate the tissue and tumor TOPO concentrations during radiotherapy by evaluating plasma TOPO levels.

IV. Evaluate, using Western blot and immunohistochemical stain, the effects of TOPO/radiotherapy on topoisomerase I levels in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL).

V. Determine whether TOPO induces apoptosis in PBL from this patient population.

VI. Examine tumor tissue pre- and post-treatment (if available) for topoisomerase I levels, DNA damage, topoisomerase I/DNA complexes, and apoptotic events.
