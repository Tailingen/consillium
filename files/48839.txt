A Study of DXC006 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors and Hematologic Malignancies
This is a phase I, open-label, first-in-human clinical study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, MTD, DLT, RP2D, the PK characteristics, preliminary anti-tumor activity, the immunogenicity of DXC006 in patients with a variety of solid tumors, including small cell lung cancer, multiple myeloma, and neuroblastoma, and hematological malignancies.
Advanced Solid Tumors|Hematological Malignancies
DRUG: DXC006
Number of participants that experienced dose limiting toxicities(DLTs) at given dose level., Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) In Order to Determine the Maximum Tolerated., 28 days|Number of participants with adverse events (AEs), The adverse events will be evaluated in accordance with CTCAE v5.0. The investigator shall assess the relationship between the events and investigational product., After first infusion of study drug, Through study completion an average of 1 year
