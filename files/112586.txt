Safety of PUR001 Monotherapy in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a Phase I, First-In-Human, open label, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary anti-cancer activity of PUR001, an anti-CD39 monoclonal antibody, in adult patients with advanced solid tumors, as monotherapy. A "3+3" design will be used to determine MTD and RP2D. .

This is a Phase I, First-In-Human, open label, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary anti-cancer activity of PUR001 in adult patients with advanced solid tumors, as monotherapy.

The primary objective of this study is to determine the dose-limiting toxicity(ies) (DLT) and/or maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of PUR001 monotherapy in patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumors.

Study consists of two parts:

Dose Escalation Cohort and Dose Expansion Cohort.

Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) will be evaluated and managed per the pre-defined DLT criteria and rules specified in the protocol. MTD and/or RP2D will be confirmed in a dose confirmation cohort.
