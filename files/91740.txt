Efficacy and Safety Study of Bendamustine With or Without Rituximab in Chronic Lymphoproliferative Disorders
The purpose of this study is collect and evaluate the clinical experience reached in Italy on the use of bendamustine alone or combined with rituximab as treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphoproliferative disorders.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia
Overall Response Rate (ORR), Evaluate the activity of Bendamustine +/- Rituximab in term of ORR, At least 2 months after completion of therapy
Progression Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS), Evaluate the activity of Bendamustine +/- Rituximab in term of PFS and OS, From the date of frist treatment cycle until the date of first documented progression or date of death for any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 150 months|Number of Adverse Events, Assess to efficacy of Bendamustine +/- Rituximab in term of grade III and IV National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI CTC) adverse events, From the date of first tratment cycle until 6 months after the date of last treatment cycle
All patients who meet the criteria for inclusion will be included in the study. A specific database will be created to collect the following information: personal data, medical history, histology related to the underlying disease, comorbidities, laboratory data, initial staging, data on the dosage and the number of cycles administered, the recorded toxicity data, the clinical response and the main events (relapse, progression, death, and cause of death). These data will then be retrospectively examined in order to obtain information about the life-saving treatment.
