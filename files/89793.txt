Repeat-Dose Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Bortezomib in Patients With Relapsed Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of this study is to characterize the clinical pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of the 2 doses of VELCADE (bortezomib) for Injection. Patients who volunteer to participate in the pharmacogenetic portion of the study, an additional blood sample will be collected before the Cycle 1 Day 1 dose of bortezomib to assess the genotype of drug metabolizing enzymes.
