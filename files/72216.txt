HealthSmart: Promoting Healthy Lifestyles for Young Adult Cancer Survivors Using Educational Videos
To assess the efficacy of the two SunSmart intervention videos to change sun protection attitudes and behaviors
Environmental Exposure to Ultraviolet Light
OTHER: THE INFORMATION + APPEARANCE VIDEO|OTHER: Information SunSmart video|OTHER: Sleep hygiene video
Change in SP Index scores from baseline to post-summer assessment, SP index is comprised of 15 self-report items assessing SP Behaviors, 3 months
Perceived appearance vulnerability, 2 items assessing perceived likelihood that UV exposure will lead to negative appearance changes, one month|Perceived health and appearance benefit, 8 self-report items assessing expected benefits to SP, one month|Perceived health vulnerability, 2 items assessing perceived likelihood that UV exposure will lead to future skin cancers., one month|SP Intentions, 13 items measuring intentions to practice SP, one month|Insomnia symptoms, 7 -item Insomnia Severity Scale (ISS). Total ISS scale scores range from a low of 0 (least insomnia) to a high of 28 (worst insomnia), one month|Change in SP Index scores from post-summer assessment to one year later, SP index is comprised of 15 self-report items assessing SP Behaviors, 12-months
SunSmart is a novel video intervention designed to prevent secondary skin cancer in young adult cancer survivors by increasing their adherence to recommended sun protection.

This study will assess two versions of the SunSmart video intervention. These are: 1) The INFORMATION VIDEO providing basic information about UV risks, including secondary skin cancer and the benefits of sun protection (SP), as well as specific SP recommendations and steps to integrate SP as part of routine self-care for the healthy cancer survivor; and 2) THE INFORMATION + APPEARANCE VIDEO which will include the full information video, along with an additional embedded video segment emphasizing negative appearance consequences of UV exposure. Primary aim of the study is to assess the impact of the video intervention on sun protection intentions and behavior in young adult cancer survivors compared to a control intervention. Secondary aims are to describe the impact of the appearance information when included in the SunSmart intervention, to investigate the extent to which the intervention changes sun protection through hypothesized mediating variables, and to describe the consistency of sleep behaviors over time in cancer survivors.
