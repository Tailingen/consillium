Lung-MAP: Talazoparib in Treating Patients With HRRD Positive Recurrent Stage IV Squamous Cell Lung Cancer
This phase II trial studies how well talazoparib works in treating patients with homologous recombination repair deficiency (HRRD) positive stage IV squamous cell lung cancer that has come back after previous treatment. Talazoparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and partial) with talazoparib (BMN 673) in HRRD Medivation (MDVN)-positive patients.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate investigator assessed progression-free survival (IA-PFS) and overall survival (OS) associated with therapy in HRRD MDVN-positive patients.

II. To evaluate ORR, IA-PFS, and OS in HRRD Foundation Medicine, Inc. (FMI)-positive patients.

III. To evaluate ORR in HRRD MDVN-negative/HRRD FMI-positive patients. IV. To evaluate the frequency and severity of toxicities associated with talazoparib (BMN 673) in HRRD FMI-positive patients.

TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To assess if the homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) score is associated with clinical outcomes (response, PFS, OS) in HRRD FMI-positive patients treated with talazoparib (BMN 673).

II. To assess if the level of PARP protein expression determined by immunohistochemistry is associated with clinical outcomes (response, PFS, OS) in HRRD FMI-positive patients treated with talazoparib (BMN 673).

III. To characterize pharmacokinetic properties of talazoparib (BMN 673).

OUTLINE:

Patients receive talazoparib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and at the end of year 3.
