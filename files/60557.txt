Chinese Surgical Robot Clinical Study on Rectectomy for Rectal Cancer
Central South University in collaboration with Tianjin University developed the first domestically produced Chinese minimally invasive surgical (MIS) robot system which named "Micro Hand S" in 2013. This new MIS robot had been authorized to enter the clinical trial stage by the Ethics Committee of the Third Xiangya Hospital at Central South University. The Micro Hand S robot is safe and feasible in the preliminary study. However, compared with minimally invasive approaches (da Vici, laparoscope), the merits and demrits of rectectomy for rectal cancer are unclear. Therefore, the investigators conduct this retrospective study to focus on this concern.
