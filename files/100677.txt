A Study of Pemetrexed Plus Carboplatin, or Pemetrexed Plus Cisplatin With Radiation Therapy Followed by Pemetrexed in Patients With Inoperable Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer
The primary purpose of this study is to determine the 2-year survival rate of both of the chemotherapy regimens in patients with inoperable non-small-cell lung cancer.
Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: pemetrexed|DRUG: cisplatin|DRUG: carboplatin|RADIATION: radiation therapy
Phase 1 - Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Carboplatin, MTD was defined as a dose at which the occurrence of at least 2 dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) was observed. DLT was defined as any of the following events occurring during the entire radiation therapy (RT) course, including a 2-week recovery period following completion of RT: Grade 4 neutropenia (\<0.5 x 10\^9 cells per liter) lasting \>7 days, febrile neutropenia; ≥Grade 3 neutropenia with fever \>38.5 degrees Celsius (°C), Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with ≥Grade 2 bleeding, ≥Grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity (excluding nausea, vomiting, and transaminase elevations) and ≥Grade 3 pulmonary or esophageal toxicity (radiation-related pneumonitis or esophagitis)., Phase 1 enrollment to the end of study treatment up to Week 11|Phase 1 - Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Cisplatin, MTD was defined as a dose at which the occurrence of at least 2 dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) was observed. DLT was defined as any of the following events occurring during the entire radiation therapy (RT) course, including a 2-week recovery period following completion of RT: Grade 4 neutropenia (\<0.5 x 10\^9 cells per liter) lasting \>7 days, febrile neutropenia; ≥Grade 3 neutropenia with fever \>38.5 degrees Celsius (°C), Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with ≥Grade 2 bleeding, ≥Grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity (excluding nausea, vomiting, and transaminase elevations) and ≥Grade 3 pulmonary or esophageal toxicity (radiation-related pneumonitis or esophagitis)., Phase 1 enrollment to the end of study treatment up to Week 11|Phase 2 - Survival Probability at 2 Years, Phase 2 randomization up to 2 years
Phase 1 - Pharmacology Toxicity: Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), Phase 1 pharmacology toxicity was defined as the number of participants experiencing dose limiting toxicities (DLTs). DLT was defined as any of the following events occurring during the entire radiation therapy (RT) course: Grade 4 neutropenia (\<0.5 x 10\^9 cells per liter) \>7 days, febrile neutropenia, ≥Grade 3 neutropenia with fever \>38.5 degrees Celsius (°C), Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with ≥Grade 2 bleeding, ≥Grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity (excluding nausea, vomiting, and transaminase elevations), and ≥Grade 3 pulmonary or esophageal toxicity (radiation-related pneumonitis or esophagitis). Grade 5 events are the events leading to the death., Phase 1 enrollment up to Week 11|Phase 1 - Percentage of Participants With Complete Response or Partial Response (Response Rate), Response rate is the percentage of participants with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), as assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines. CR is disappearance of all target and non-target lesions; PR is ≥30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions. Response rate is calculated as a total number of participants with CR or PR divided by the total number of participants treated multiplied by 100., Phase 1 enrollment to the end of the study treatment up to Week 11|Phase 2 - Pharmacology Toxicity: Number of Participants With Adverse Events, Phase 2 pharmacology toxicity was defined as the number of participants who experienced serious adverse events or all other nonserious adverse events during the study. A summary of serious adverse events and other nonserious adverse events is located in the Reported Adverse Events section., Phase 2 randomization to the end of the study treatment up to 30.0 months|Phase 2 - Time to Progression, Time to disease progression was measured from randomization of Study Phase 2 to the first observation of disease progression according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. Disease progression is ≥20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions and/or a new lesion., Phase 2 randomization to measured disease progression up to 24 months|Phase 2 - Median Survival, Phase 2 randomization to death as the result of any cause up to 30.0 month|Phase 2 - Percentage of Participants With Complete Response or Partial Response (Response Rate), Response rate is the percentage of participants with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), as assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines. CR is disappearance of all target and non-target lesions; PR is ≥30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions. Response rate is calculated as a total number of participants with CR or PR divided by the total number of participants treated multiplied by 100., Phase 2 randomization to the end of the treatment up to 30.0 months
