This is a phase 2, open-label, multicenter, multi-cohort study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Linperlisib combined with standard immunochemotherapy in the treatment of relapsed/refractory LBCL after first-line treatment. This study is divided into a safety run-in phase and a dose expansion phase.The primary objective of the safety run-in phase was to determine the recommended dose for the dose expansion phase based on dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs).

The dose expansion phase consisted of Cohort 1 and Cohort 2.Cohort 1 was transplant-ineligible patients who received Linperlisib in combination with R-Gemox at RP2D for 6 cycles.Cohort 2 consisted of patients scheduled for transplantation who received 3 cycles of Linperlisib combined with R-ICE/DHAP/GVM regimen, followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in responding patients
