Phase I Trial of Vorinostat (MK-0683, SAHA) in Combination With Decitabine in Patients With AML or MDS (MK-0683-055 EXT1)
This study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of vorinostat in combination with decitabine as well as the in vivo molecular and biological effects of vorinostat in patients with refractory or relapsed Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) and intermediate or high risk as defined by International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS). Participants with Acute Myelogenous Leukemia or Myelodysplastic Syndrome are eligible.

DRUG: vorinostat|DRUG: decitabine
Number of Participants Experiencing Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) Events, Participants who received at least one dose of vorinostat in combination with decitabine intravenous (IV) at a dose of 20 mg/m\^2 daily for 5 days along with oral vorinostat 400 mg once daily for 7 to 14 days in a 28-day cycle concurrently or sequentially, were evaluated to determine the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) determined by the number of participants experiencing dose limiting toxicity (DLT) events defined as any Grade 3 or 4 non-hematological toxicity (reported adverse event) and/or myelosuppression lasting \>42 days., Day 1 to 28 of Cycle 1
Objective Response Rate in Participants Treated With Vorinostat + Decitabine With Refractory or Relapse Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML), Objective Response Rate was measured in participants with refractory or relapse AML (acute myelogenous leukemia) in combination with Decitabine who were treated with vorinostat and decitabine on either a concurrent or sequential regimen. The Objective response was defined as any confirmed complete remission or any confirmed partial remission for AML participants and complete remission, confirmed partial remission or confirmed hematologic improvement for Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) participants., Approximately 6 months|Objective Response Rate in Participants Treated With Vorinostat + Decitabine With Intermediate-high Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) or Untreated Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML), Objective Response Rate was measured in participants with intermediate-high risk MDS or untreated AML who were treated with vorinostat and decitabine either on a concurrent or sequential regimen. The Objective response was defined as any confirmed complete remission or any confirmed partial remission for AML participants and complete remission, confirmed partial remission or confirmed hematologic improvement for MDS participants., Approximately 6 months
