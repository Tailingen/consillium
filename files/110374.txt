Dual Inhibition of EGFR With Afatinib and Cetuximab in the Treatment of Advanced Squamous Cell Cancers of the Head and Neck
This is a single arm Phase II study for patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, who are previously treated with a platinum based regimen or with an immune checkpoint inhibitor. The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of cetuximab and afatinib.
Squamous Cell Cancers of the Head and Neck
DRUG: cetuximab|DRUG: afatinib
Tumor shrinkage, Objective Response Rate (Complete Response + Partial Response), defined by tumor shrinkage (mm), per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1., Disease progression or end of treatment (up to 2 years)
Progression-free survival in weeks, We will use Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to estimate the median PFS in the cohort., 1 year follow-up|Overall survival in months, Measured by a monthly phone calls. We will use Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to estimate the median and OS in the cohort., 1 year follow-up|Duration of response in weeks, 1 year follow-up|Toxicity assessed with National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0, Up to 2.5 years
Exploratory biomarker analysis, Analysis of tumor-tissue from biopsies obtained at baseline, after four weeks of treatment with the combination, and again at disease progression or end of treatment, Up to 2 years
This study will be a multicenter, single-arm, open-label Phase II trial. Patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, who are previously treated with a platinum based regimen or with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy or both, will be eligible for participation on the study. After a baseline evaluation and biopsy (where feasible), they will be treated with weekly/bi-weekly intravenous cetuximab and daily oral afatinib. Biopsy will be repeated where feasible after 4 weeks (window of +1 week) on therapy and again at disease progression or end of treatment.

Treatment will continue until disease progression or development of Grade 3 or higher drug related toxicities that fail to resolve to Grade 2 despite appropriate supportive care.
