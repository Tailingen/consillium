CINC424A2X01B Rollover Protocol
This is a long term safety study for patients that have been treated with either ruxolitinib or a combination of ruxolitinib with panobinostat, on a Novartis or Incyte sponsored study, who have been judged by the study Investigator to benefit from ongoing treatment.
Primary Myelofibrosis|Polycythemia Vera|Graft Versus Host Disease|Acute Myeloid Leukemia|Thalassemia
DRUG: ruxolitinib|DRUG: panobinostat
Incidence and severity of AEs and SAEs, The incidence of treatment-emergent AEs and SAEs (new or worsening from baseline) will be summarized by system organ class and/or preferred term, severity (based on CTCAE grades)., 12 years
Proportion of participants with clinical benefit as assessed by the investigator at scheduled visits., The analysis of clinical benefit will be descriptive only and cannot be compared to efficacy results of other studies. In addition, as clinical benefit was only added in protocol amendment 1, it may not be available for all participants., 12 years|Incidence and severity of AEs and SAEs by treatment group, AEs and SAEs for participants in the Safety group will be listed and summarized by treatment group (ruxolitinib monotherapy / ruxolitinib + panobinostat combination), 12 years
This roll-over protocol allows patients from multiple protocols, who are still receiving clinical benefit, to continue their treatment in one study that covers multiple indications. The population for the roll-over study should be consistent with the population defined in the parent studies. The primary eligibility criteria for a patient to enter the roll-over protocol is the participation and completion of a Novartis or Incyte study with ruxolitinib monotherapy or combination of ruxolitinib and panobinostat. Efficacy parameters will not be measured; however safety data and an evaluation of clinical benefit will be collected.
