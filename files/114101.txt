Compare Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy of DOS Versus SOX in Locally Advanced Gastric Adenocarcinoma.
This is a randomized, multicenter, controlled, adaptive phase II/III clinical study. The aim is to compare neoadjuvant chemotherapy of Docetaxel，Oxaliplatin combined with S-1(DOS) versus Oxaliplatin combined with S-1(SOX) in locally advanced gastric adenocarcinoma
Gastric Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Oxaliplatin
The rate of pathologic complete response（pCR%）, Evaluation of pCR% of DOS regimen versus SOX regimen in locally advanced gastric adenocarcinoma, 1 year
Overall Survival : From date of enrollment until the date of death, Evaluation of the Overall Survival of DOS regimen versus SOX regimen in locally advanced gastric adenocarcinoma, 5 years|Progression-free Survival：From date of enrollment until the date of first documented progression or second gastric cancer or death from any cause, whichever came first., Evaluation of the Progression-free Survival of DOS regimen versus SOX regimen in locally advanced gastric adenocarcinoma, 3 years
This trial is conducted in patients with locally advanced gastric adenocarcinoma. Eligible patients are randomized into two arms at 1:1 ratio to receive Docetaxel, Oxaliplatin combined with S-1(DOS) for 4 cycles or Oxaliplatin combined with S-1(SOX) for 3 cycles as neoadjuvant chemotherapy. All eligible patients will receive D2 gastrectomy if possible. Then, all eligible patients will also received DOS for 4 cycles or SOX for 3 cycles within 8 weeks after surgery. Study evaluation time is until death of patients or deadline set by the researchers.
