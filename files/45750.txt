Study of CC-96191 in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This Phase 1, clinical study of CC-96191 will explore the safety, tolerability and preliminary biological and clinical activity of CC-96191 as a single-agent in the setting of Relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (R/R AML).

The dose escalation (Part A) of the study will explore escalating intravenous doses of CC-96191 to estimate the MTD and/or RP2D of CC-96191 as monotherapy.

The expansion (Part B), will further evaluate the safety and efficacy of CC-96191 administered at or below the MTD in one or more expansion cohorts in order to determine the RP2D.
Leukemia, Myeloid
DRUG: CC-96191
Dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), Are defined as toxicities that meet the protocol-specified criteria occurring within the DLT assessment window (Cycle 1, Days 1 to at least 28 and up to 42 days) that cannot be attributed to a clearly identifiable cause such as underlying illness, disease progression, other concurrent illness, or concomitant medication., Up to 42 days after the first dose|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), Is defined as the highest dose at which less than 33% of the population treated with CC-96191 experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in the first cycle., Up to 35 days after the last dose|Adverse Events (AEs), Type, frequency, seriousness, severity and relationship of AEs to CC-96191, Up to 35 days after the last dose
Complete remission rate (CRR), As defined by the European Leukemia Net (ELN) AML response criteria., Up to approximately 2 years|Objective response rate (ORR), As defined by the European Leukemia Net (ELN) AML response criteria., Up to approximately 2 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), Is defined as the time from the first dose of CC-96191 to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause., Up to approximately 2 years|Overall survival (OS), Is measured as the time from the first dose of CC-96191 to death due to any cause., Up to approximately 2 years|Duration of remission, For subjects with best response of complete remission (CR) of any type, morphologic leukemia free state (MLFS) or partial remission (PR), duration of response (DOR) is measured from the time when criteria for CR/MLFS/PR are first met (whichever is first recorded) until the first date at which relapse, or progressive disease is objectively documented, Up to approximately 2 years|Time to remission, Time from the date of first dose to the earliest date of any response (CR of any type, MLFS or PR), Up to approximately 2 years|Pharmacokinetics - Cmax, Maximum serum concentration of drug, Up to 35 days after last dose|Pharmacokinetics - AUC, Area under the serum concentration time-curve, Up to 35 days after last dose|Pharmacokinetics - tmax, Time to peak (maximum) serum concentration, Up to 35 days after last dose|Pharmacokinetics - t1/2, Terminal half-life, Up to 35 days after last dose|Pharmacokinetics - CL, Total body clearance of the drug from the serum, Up to 35 days after last dose|Pharmacokinetics - Vss, Volume of distribution at steady-state, Up to 35 days after last dose|Presence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA), Detection of anti-drug antibodies in participants, Up to 35 days after last dose|Frequency of anti-drug antibodies (ADA), Frequency of anti-drug antibodies in participants, Up to 35 days after last dose
