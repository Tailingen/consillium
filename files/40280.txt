CaboCHECK - Cabozantinib in Adult Patients With Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma Following Prior Systemic Check Point Inhibition Therapy: a Retrospective, Non-interventional Study
This is a non-interventional study to retrospectively evaluate the safety and to describe the effectiveness of cabozantinib after immunoncologic treatment with nivolumab or nivolumab plus ipilimumab in routine clinical practice. It consists of a retrospective chart review of patients who have already completed treatment with cabozantinib after nivolumab or nivolumab plus ipilimumab before inclusion.
