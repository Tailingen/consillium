A Study to Evaluate Subcutaneous Daratumumab in Combination With Standard Multiple Myeloma Treatment Regimens
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical benefit of subcutaneous (SC) daratumumab administered in combination with standard multiple myeloma (MM) regimens in participants with MM as measured by overall response rate (ORR) or very good partial response (VGPR) or better rate.

D-VMP, D-Rd, and D-Kd Cohorts: Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved partial response (PR) or better according to international myeloma working group (IMWG) criteria. IMWG criteria for PR: greater than or equal to (\>=) 50 percent (%) reduction of serum M-protein and reduction in 24-hour urinary M-protein by \>=90% or to less than (\<) 200 milligrams (mg) per 24 hours, If the serum and urine M-protein are not measurable, a decrease of \>=50% in the difference between involved and uninvolved free light chain (FLC) levels is required in place of the M-protein criteria, If serum and urine M-protein are not measurable, and serum free light assay is also not measurable, \>=50% reduction in bone marrow plasma cells (PCs) is required in place of M-protein, provided baseline bone marrow plasma cell percentage was \>=30%. In addition to the above criteria, if present at baseline, a \>=50% reduction in the size of soft tissue plasmacytomas is also required., Up to 2 years 3 months|D-VRd Cohort: Percentage of Participants With Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) or Better Response, VGPR or better rate was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved VGPR or complete response (CR) (including stringent complete response \[sCR\]) according to the IMWG criteria during or after the study treatment. VGPR: Serum and urine component detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis, or \>= 90% reduction in serum M-protein plus urine M-protein level \<100 mg/24 hour; CR: negative immunofixation on the serum and urine, Disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas and \<5% PCs in bone marrow; sCR: CR in addition to having a normal FLC ratio and an absence of clonal cells in bone marrow by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, 2-4 color flow cytometry., Up to 2 years and 3 months
Maximum Observed Serum Concentration (Cmax) of Daratumumab, Cmax was defined as maximum serum concentration observed following daratumumab administration. Each cycle for: D-VRd cohort is of 21 days, D-VMP cohort is of 42 days and D-Rd and D-Kd cohorts is of 28 days. Each cohort have a treatment period of 84 days., D-VRd: Day 4 of Cycles 1 and 4 and post treatment at Week 8; D-VMP: Day 4 of Cycles 1 and 2 and post treatment at Week 8; D-Rd and D-Kd: Day 4 of Cycles 1 and 3 and post treatment at Week 8|Percentage of Participants With Infusion-Related Reactions (IRRs), Percentage of Participants with IRRs were reported. The administration-related systemic reactions are referred to as IRRs., For D-VRD Arm: Baseline up to 2 years 3 months; For D-VMP, D-Rd and D-Kd Arms: Baseline up to 2 years 7 months|D-VMP, D-Rd, and D-Kd Cohorts: Percentage of Participants With VGPR or Better Response, VGPR or better rate was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved VGPR or CR (including sCR) according to the IMWG criteria during or after the study treatment. VGPR: Serum and urine component detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis, or \>= 90% reduction in serum M-protein plus urine M-protein level \<100 mg per 24 hour; CR: negative immunofixation on the serum and urine, Disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas and \<5% PCs in bone marrow; sCR: CR in addition to having a normal FLC ratio and an absence of clonal cells in bone marrow by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, 2-4 color flow cytometry., From baseline up to 2 years 7 months|D-VRd Cohort: Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved a PR or better, IMWG criteria, during the study or during follow up. IMWG criteria for PR \>= 50% reduction of serum M-protein and reduction in 24 hour urinary M-protein by \>=90% or to \<200 mg/24 hours, if the serum and urine M-protein are not measurable, a decrease of \>=50% in the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels is required in place of the M-protein criteria, If serum and urine M-protein are not measurable, and serum free light assay is also not measurable, \>=50% reduction in bone marrow PCs is required in place of M-protein, provided baseline bone marrow plasma cell percentage was \>=30%, in addition to the above criteria, if present at baseline, a \>=50% reduction in the size of soft tissue plasmacytomas is also required., Up to 2 years and 3 months|Percentage of Participants With CR or Better Response, CR or better rate was defined as the percentage of participants with a CR or better response (that is, CR and sCR) as per IMWG criteria. CR: as negative immunofixation on the serum and urine and disappearance of soft tissue plasmacytomas and less than (\<) 5 percent plasma cells in bone marrow; sCR: CR plus normal FLC ratio and absence of clonal PCs by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence or 2- to 4-color flow cytometry., For D-VRD Arm: Baseline up to 2 years 3 months; For D-VMP, D-Rd and D-Kd Arms: Baseline up to 2 years 7 months|D-VMP, D-Rd and D-Kd Cohorts: Duration of Response (DOR), DOR was defined as the time from the date of initial documented response (PR or better response) to the date of first documented evidence of progressive disease (PD) or death due to PD. PD is defined as an increase of 25% from the lowest response value in one of the following: serum and urine M-component (absolute increase must be \>=0.5 gram per deciliter \[g/dL\] and \>=200 mg/24 hours respectively); only in participants without measurable serum and urine M-protein levels the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels (absolute increase must be \>10 mg/dL); definite development of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas or definite increase in the size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas; development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium \>11.5 mg/dL) that can be attributed solely to PC proliferative disorder., From baseline up to 2 years 7 months|Percentage of Participants With Anti-Daratumumab Antibodies, Percentage of participants with antibodies to daratumumab were reported., For D-VRD Arm: Baseline up to 2 years 3 months; For D-VMP, D-Rd and D-Kd Arms: Baseline up to 2 years 7 months|Percentage of Participants With Anti-rHuPH20 Antibodies, Percentage of participants with antibodies to rHuPH20 were reported., For D-VRD Arm: Baseline up to 2 years 3 months; For D-VMP, D-Rd and D-Kd Arms: Baseline up to 2 years 7 months|D-VMP, D-Rd, and D-Kd Cohorts: Percentage of Participants With Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Negative Rate, MRD negativity rate was defined as the percentage of participants who were considered MRD negative after MRD testing at any timepoint after the first dose by bone marrow aspirate. MRD negativity rate was assessed by next-generation sequencing at a threshold of \<10\^5., Up to 2 years and 3 months
The hypothesis is that the addition of daratumumab administered SC to standard MM regimens will improve responses compared to response data observed in completed phase 3 studies without daratumumab. Disease evaluations will include measurements of myeloma proteins, bone marrow examinations, skeletal surveys, assessment of extramedullary plasmacytomas, and measurements of serum calcium corrected for albumin. Safety will be measured by adverse events, laboratory test results, electrocardiogram (ECGs), vital sign measurements, physical examination findings, SC injection-site assessments, and assessment of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score. Study will consist of 3 phases (screening, treatment and follow-up) and duration of study is approximately 3 years.
