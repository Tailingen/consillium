IL13Rα2 CAR-T for Patients With r/r Glioma
This is a dose exploration clinical trial to assess the safety and feasibility of the IL13Ra2-targeted CAR-T in glioma.
Glioma
BIOLOGICAL: IL13Rα2 CAR-T
Safety of IL13Rα2 CAR-T, The safety of IL13Rα2 CAR-T will be assessed based on the totality of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and adverse event (AE) data collected during this phase., Day 0 - Day 730
Overall Response Rate (ORR), To evaluate the percentage of subjects who have a confirmed partial response (PR) and complete response (CR) per immunotherapy response assessment in neuro-oncology (iRANO) criteria., Day 0 - Day 730|Duration of Response (DOR), To evaluate the duration from the time that criteria are met for CR or PR per iRANO until disease progression or death due to any cause., Day 0 - Day 730|Progression Free Survival (PFS), To evaluate the time from the date of the first CAR-T infusion until disease progression per iRANO or death due to any cause., Day 0 - Day 730|Overall Survival (OS), To evaluate the time from the date of the first CAR-T infusion to death due to any cause., Day 0 - Day 730|Overall Survival (OS) at 6 months (OS6), To evaluate the percentage of survival subjects at 6 months after the first CAR-T infusion., Day 0 - Day 180|Overall Survival (OS) at 12 months (OS12), To evaluate the percentage of survival subjects at 12 months after the first CAR-T infusion., Day 0 - Day 365|The levels of IL13Rα2 CAR-T cell and IL13Rα2 CAR in the CSF and peripheral blood, To detect the levels of IL13Rα2 CAR-T cell and IL13Rα2 CAR in the CSF and peripheral blood., Day 0 - Day 730|The levels of cytokines in the CSF and peripheral blood, To detect levels of cytokines in the CSF and peripheral blood, cytokines will include IL-2, IL-6, IFN-γ, TNF-α, etc., Day 0 - Day 730
The Exploratory Indicators, To analyze tumor microenvironment and CAR-T cell infiltrative levels in tumor tissues before and after treatment by immunohistochemistry and/or transcriptome sequencing, and explore the tumor or immune cell markers related to disease prognosis and IL13Rα2 expression., Day 0 - Day 730
Interleukin 13 receptor subunit alpha-2 (IL13Ra2A) is a high-affinity membrane receptor of the anti-inflammatory Th2 cytokine IL13, which is overexpressed in glioma and correlated with poor prognosis.

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy is a promising treatment approach for many malignancies. IL13Ra2-targeted CAR-T cells are under investigation in several clinical trials in primary CNS malignancies.

The investigators now designed a new structure CAR targeted IL13Ra2, and initiated a single arm, open, dose exploration clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, clinical efficacy, and pharmacokinetic characteristics of IL13Rα2 CAR-T for patients with glioma. This clinical trial will enroll 12-30 cases of patients with IL13α2-positive recurrent or refractory WHO grade 4 glioma (r/r WHO4 glioma), aiming to find the maximum tolerable dose (MTD), the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and preliminary efficacy of the new structure IL13Ra2 CAR-T.
