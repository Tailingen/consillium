A Phase I Study of SOR-C13 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of SOR-C13 in treating patients with solid tumors that have spread to other places in the body (advanced) and does not respond to treatment. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as SOR-C13, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To define the maximum tolerated doses (MTD) of TRPV6 calcium channel inhibitor SOR-C13 (SOR-C13) in subjects with advanced solid tumor cancers of epithelial origin.

II. To define the safety profiles of the treatment.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate clinical response signals to the treatment. II. To assess predictive biomarkers (baseline molecular mutation status) and/or resistant pathways by comparing molecular signatures at baseline versus at time of relapse in patients who have achieved objective responses.

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

Patients receive TRPV6 calcium channel inhibitor SOR-C13 intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22, and 23. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
