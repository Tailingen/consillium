A Dose Exploration Study of Almonertinib for EGFRm NSCLC Patients With Brain/Leptomeningeal Metastasis (ARTISTRY)
Almonertinib is a three-generation epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor(EGFR-TKI), which has shown competitive potential in the second-line treatment against first-generation TKIs. This study aims to explore the efficacy and safety of different doses of almonertinib in the first-line and second-line treatment of brain metastases/meningeal metastases in NSCLC patients.
