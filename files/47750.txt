Radioimmunotherapy With 131I-L19SIP in Patients With Cancer
The aim of this Study Protocol is to provide a basis for the clinical development of 131I-L19SIP as an anti-cancer therapeutic agent, following the promising results of a Phase I study.
Patients With Cancer
DRUG: 131I-L19SIP Radioimmunotherapy (RIT)
Phase I: Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), Establishment of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended dose (RD) for the radiolabelled L19SIP monoclonal antibody., 4 weeks|Phase II: Antitumour activity, Investigation of the antitumour activity of 131I-L19SIP at the RD, in patients with advanced cancer., 1- 14 months
Phase I: Study of the variation of radioactivity of 131I in whole blood, at several time intervals (Pharmacokinetics), Evaluation of the pharmacokinetics of 131IL19SIP., 2 days|Phase II: Safety profile, Determination of the overall safety profile of the iodinated antibody characterized by type, frequency, severity, timing and relationship to study therapy of adverse events and laboratory abnormalities in the first and following cycles in all patients receiving a therapeutic dose., 30 days/ administration|Phase II: Overall Response Rate (ORR), Evaluation of the overall Response Rate (ORR) for all patients having received a therapeutic dose., 6 and 12 months|Phase II: Progression free survival (PFS), Evaluation of the progression free survival (PFS) for all patients having received a therapeutic dose., 6 and 12 months|Phase II: Survival rate, Evaluation of the survival rate at 6 and 12 months and overall survival time for all patients having received a therapeutic dose., 6 and 12 months
The L19SIP antibody is a fully human antibody, capable of preferential localization around tumor blood vessels while sparing normal tissues. The formation of new blood vessels is a rare event in the adult (exception made for the female reproductive cycle), but is a pathological feature of most aggressive types of cancer. The study aims at determining the therapeutic potential of the L19SIP antibody in SIP format, labelled with the radionuclide 131I, for the treatment of patients with different cancer types. The study follows a Phase I study performed with 131I-L19SIP in over 30 patients with cancer, which has shown an excellent tolerability at radioactive doses as high as 150 mCi and therapeutic benefit for some patients enrolled in the study.
