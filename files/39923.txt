PF-00477736 Is Being Studied In Advanced Solid Tumors In Combination With Chemotherapy With Gemcitabine
To determine the overall safety of PF-00477736 when given in combination with gemcitabine, a chemotherapy agent, in patients with advanced solid tumors and determine the maximum dose of PF-00477736 that can be safely given in combination with gemcitabine. This is the first study of PF-00477736 in humans.

The study was closed to enrollment as of 17 May 2010 due to business reasons. The patient on study continued treatment until 19 April 2011 when stopped for complete response. Premature closure was not prompted by any safety or efficacy concerns.
