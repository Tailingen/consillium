Nab-Paclitaxel and Gemcitabine Plus Camrelizumab and Radiotherapy for Locally Advanced Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
The study is a prospective and observational cohort study. The purpose is to to investigate the safety and efficacy of nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine plus camrelizumab and radiotherapy versus nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine alone for locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC)
PDAC - Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma
RADIATION: Radiotherapy|DRUG: Nab-paclitaxel|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Camrelizumab
Progression-free survival, defined as the time from randomization until disease progression or death from any cause, whichever happens first. Patients who withdraw or who are lost to follow-up will be censored at the date last known to be alive and progression free. Patients not having an event will be censored at the date last seen alive., two years|Overall survival, defined as the time from randomization until death from any cause. Patients who withdraw or who are lost to follow-up will be censored at the date last known to be alive. Patients remaining alive throughout the duration of the study will have their survival time censored on the date last seen alive., two years
Adverse events, adverse events during the treatment period using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) (version 5.0)., two years|Tumor response, measured according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria 1.1 by means of computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at each follow-up., two years
We will prospectively collect 100 patients who receive nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine plus camrelizumab and radiotherapy or nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine alone. Data will be stored in a private database. The process of data collection will be supervised and regular data examination will be performed.
