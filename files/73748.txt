Bomedemstat (IMG-7289/MK-3543) in Participants With Myelofibrosis (IMG-7289-CTP-102/MK-3543-002)
This is a Phase 1/2 open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, steady-state pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of a lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) inhibitor, bomedemstat (IMG-7289/MK-3543), administered orally once daily in participants with myelofibrosis.

The primary hypothesis is that bomedemstat is a safe and tolerable orally available agent when administered to participants with myelofibrosis including primary myelofibrosis (PMF), post-polycythaemia vera-myelofibrosis (PPVMF), and post-essential thrombocythaemia-myelofibrosis (PET-MF) (collectively referred to as 'MF'); inhibition of LSD1 by bomedemstat will reduce spleen size in those with splenomegaly, improve haematopoiesis and reduce constitutional symptoms associated with these disorders.

DRUG: Bomedemstat
Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), DLT was defined as any one of the following adverse events (AEs) that occured through Day 7 of the Initial Treatment Period (ITP) and was considered by the Investigator to be possibly, probably or definitely related to bomedemstat:

* Thrombocytopenia leading to clinically significant sequelae (i.e., a clinically significant bleeding event or the need for prophylactic transfusions)
* A clinically significant bleeding event in a participant with a platelet count \>50 x 10\^9/L (50 k/μL)
* Any Grade 4 or 5 non-haematologic adverse event
* Any Grade 3 non-haematologic adverse event with failure to recover to Grade 2 within 7 days of drug cessation, with the following exceptions: ≥ Grade 3 nausea, vomiting or diarrhea that responds to standard medical care; ≥ Grade 3 aesthenia lasting less than 14 days; any Grade 3 electrolyte abnormality unrelated to the underlying malignancy and persisting greater than 24 hours.

The number of participants with a DLT were reported., Up to Day 7 of the ITP|Number of Participants With Serious Adverse Events, An AE was any undesirable physical, psychological or behavioral effect experienced by a participant, in conjunction with the use of the drug or biologic, whether or not product-related. This included any untoward signs or symptoms experienced by the participant from the time of first dose with bomedemstat until completion of the study. Serious AEs (SAEs) were any AE that resulted in death, life-threatening experience, required or prolonged inpatient hospitalization, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly, or important medical events. The number of participants with at least one treatment-emergent (TE) SAE was reported for each arm., Up to approximately 30 months|Number of Participants With Adverse Events, An AE was any undesirable physical, psychological or behavioral effect experienced by a participant, in conjunction with the use of the drug or biologic, whether or not product-related. This included any untoward signs or symptoms experienced by the participant from the time of first dose with bomedemstat until completion of the study. The number of participants with at least one TE AE was reported for each arm., Up to approximately 30 months|Number of Participants That Discontinued Study Treatment Due To AEs, An AE was any undesirable physical, psychological or behavioral effect experienced by a participant, in conjunction with the use of the drug or biologic, whether or not product-related. This included any untoward signs or symptoms experienced by the participant from the time of first dose with bomedemstat until completion of the study. The number of participants that discontinued study treatment with bomedemstat due to a TE AE was reported for each arm., Up to approximately 29 months|Phase 1/2a Portion: Observed Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of Bomedemstat, Cmax was defined as the maximum observed concentration after administration obtained directly from the concentration time profile. Blood and plasma samples were collected at pre-specified timepoints to calculate Cmax in participants of the Phase 1/2a portion of the study. As pre-specified by the protocol and Pharmacokinetic Analysis Plan (PAP), Phase 2b participants were excluded from this analysis., Day 21: Pre-dose and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 24 hours (Day 22) after dosing.|Phase 1/2a Portion: Time to Maximum Concentration (Tmax) of Bomedemstat, Tmax was defined as the time to maximum concentration after administration obtained by inspection. Blood and plasma samples were collected at pre-specified timepoints to calculate Tmax in participants of the Phase 1/2a portion of the study. As pre-specified by the protocol and Pharmacokinetic Analysis Plan (PAP), Phase 2b participants were excluded from this analysis., Day 21: Pre-dose and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 24 hours (Day 22) after dosing.|Phase 1/2a Portion: Area Under the Concentration-time Curve of Bomedemstat From Time 0 to 24 Hours Post-dose (AUC0-24), AUC0-24 was defined as the area under the concentration versus time curve calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule from the zero time-point to the 24-hour time-point concentration. Blood and plasma samples were collected at pre-specified timepoints to calculate AUC0-24 in participants of the Phase 1/2a portion of the study. As pre-specified by the protocol and Pharmacokinetic Analysis Plan (PAP), Phase 2b participants were excluded from this analysis., Day 21: Pre-dose and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 24 hours (Day 22) after dosing.|Phase 1/2a Portion: Apparent Total Clearance (CL/F) of Bomedemstat After Oral Administration, CL/F was defined as the apparent total clearance of drug after oral administration. Blood and plasma samples were collected at pre-specified timepoints to calculate CL/F in participants of the Phase 1/2a portion of the study. As pre-specified by the protocol and Pharmacokinetic Analysis Plan (PAP), Phase 2b participants were excluded from this analysis., Day 21: Pre-dose and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 24 hours (Day 22) after dosing.|Percentage Change From Baseline in Spleen Volume, Change in spleen volume was assessed based on calculated spleen volume (ml) measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or computerized tomography (CT) scan (where locally permitted) if the participant was not a candidate for MRI from Day 0. Percentage change from baseline in spleen volume was reported at Initial Treatment Period (ITP) Day 84, ITP Day 168, Additional Treatment Period 1 (ATP1) Day 84 (Study Day 253), and ATP1 Day 168 (Study Day 337)., Baseline, ITP Day 84 (Study Day 84), ITP Day 168 (Study Day 168), ATP1 Day 84 (Study Day 253), and ATP1 Day 168 (Study Day 337)|Percentage Change From Baseline in Spleen Size, Change in spleen size was assessed based on spleen palpation (in cm) at each visit. Percentage change from baseline in spleen size was reported at ITP Day 84, ITP Day 168, ATP1 Day 84 (Study Day 253), ATP1 Day 168 (Study Day 337), ATP2 Day 84 (Study Day 422), ATP2 Day 168 (Study Day 506), and ATP3 Day 84 (Study Day 591). As prespecified by the Statistical Analysis Plan, assessments for the Phase 1/2 groups were summarized using visit windowing after the Day 84 visit of the ITP to allow for comparison with the Phase 2b groups at ITP Day 168., Baseline, ITP Day 84 (Study Day 84), ITP Day 168 (Study Day 168), ATP1 Day 84 (Study Day 253), ATP1 Day 168 (Study Day 337), ATP2 Day 84 (Study Day 422), ATP2 Day 168 (Study Day 506), and ATP3 Day 84 (Study Day 591)
This study initiated as a Phase 1/2a study assessing the safety of the starting dose, an 85-day duration of treatment, and the PK and PD effects of bomedemstat, with transition to a Phase 2b study incorporating changes supported by the Phase 1/2a data.
