A Self-Management Energy Conservation Program for Cancer-Related Fatigue
The purpose of this pilot study is to examine a 12-week self-management energy conservation program (ECAM)'s effects on fatigue, and secondarily on sleep, physical activity, anxiety and depression, self-efficacy, and beliefs about fatigue in a group of Thai women with breast cancer who are undergoing chemotherapy. We will also evaluate how well women like the intervention, how easy it is to use and whether women will do the activities.

BEHAVIORAL: Self-management energy conservation
Cancer-related fatigue (CRF), A 22-item scale, 0 to 10 numerical scaling, with four dimensions of fatigue will be used to measure CRF severity., Change from baseline CRF scores at 12 weeks
Acceptability, Open-ended questions will be used to ask about the most positive and negative aspects of the intervention, what modules did they use the most, what were barriers to using the intervention, what would they like to see added or deleted in future modules, and any suggestions on how the program could be improved., at 12 weeks|Satisfaction, Scaling questions about satisfaction with the intervention will be responded on a 5-point scale (1 = dissatisfied to 5 = completely satisfied)., at 12 weeks|The General Sleep Disturbance (GSD), A 21-item, eight-point Likert scale from 0 (never) to 7 (every day) will be used to measure subjective sleep disturbance., Change from baseline GSD scores at 12 weeks|Physical Activity (subjective measure), Godin Leisure-Time Physical Activity Questionnaire (GSLTPAQ): A 4-item self-administered questionnaire asking information about the number of times one engages in mild, moderate, and strenuous leisure-time physical activity bouts of at least 15 minutes duration in a week, and also asking how often participants typically engage in any regular activity until sweating or a racing heart on a scale of often, sometimes, never or rarely., Change from baseline GSLTPAG scores at 12 weeks|Physical Activity (objective measure), A pedometer will be used to assess how many steps are taken each day., Changes from baseline steps per day at 12 weeks|Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), The HADS is a 14-item questionnaire, Change from baseline HADS scores at 12 weeks|Self-Efficacy for Managing Chronic Disease Scale (SEMCDS), This 6-item scale contain items will be used to measures self-reported current level of confidence to manage control the patient's symptoms, role function, emotional functioning, and communicating with physicians., Change from baseline SEMCDS scores at 12 weeks|Fatigue Belief Questions (FBQ), A 20-item, six-point Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree) will be used to measure the fatigue beliefs., Change from baseline FBQ scores at 12 weeks
Cancer-related fatigue is a distressing and multidimensional symptom. Research in the US has explored the efficacy of energy conservation interventions for fatigue and related symptoms but no previous ECAM programs have been tested in Thailand.
