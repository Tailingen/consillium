A Study Comparing BL-B01D1 With the Investigator's Choice of Chemotherapy in Patients With Platinum-resistant Recurrent Epithelial Ovarian Cancer
This trial is a registered, phase III, randomized, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BL-B01D1 in patients with platinum-resistant recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer.
Epithelial Ovarian Cancer|Fallopian Tube Cancer|Primary Peritoneal Cancer
DRUG: BL-B01D1|DRUG: Liposomal doxorubicin, Paclitaxel or Topotecan
Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by BIRC is defined as the time between the date subjects are randomized and the first observation of disease progression (based on BICR's image-based assessment) or death., Up to approximately 24 months
Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time between the subject's randomization date and subject's death., Up to approximately 24 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the number of CR and PR in the treatment and control groups divided by the number of that group in the full analysis set (FAS)., Up to approximately 24 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Disease Control Rate (DCR) : Percentage of all randomized subjects who rated the best overall response (BOR) as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), and disease stabilization (SD) according to RECIST 1.1 criteria., Up to approximately 24 months|Duration of Response (DOR), Duration of Response (DOR) : defined as the period from the date when tumor response is first recorded to the date when objective tumor progression is first recorded or the date of death., Up to approximately 24 months|RR (Response Rate), RR is defined as the proportion of subjects with an overall assessment of remission by RECIST v1.1 and GCIG CA-125 criteria., Up to approximately 24 months|CA-125 Response Rate, CA-125 Response Rate is defined as the proportion of subjects evaluated as remission by GCIG CA-125 criteria., Up to approximately 24 months|Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE), TEAE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally emerging, or any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition during the treatment of BL-B01D1. The type, frequency and severity of TEAE will be evaluated during the treatment of BL-B01D1., Up to approximately 24 months|Anti-drug antibody (ADA), Frequency of anti-BL-B01D1 antibody (ADA) will be investigated., Up to approximately 24 months
