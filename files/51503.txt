Relationship Between Microbiota and Prognosis of Hepatocellular Carcinoma(HCC) After Systemic Treatments
By tracking the short-term and long-term results of HCC patients treated with systemic therapies,the difference of microbiota between responded patients and non-responded patients was analyzed, and the correlation between gut and oral microbiota and short-term and long-term results was explored, so as to improve people's awareness of microbiota and pay attention to its prevention and treatment.
Liver Cancer|Microbiota|Adverse Event|Prognosis|Efficacy
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: questionnaire survey
Post-treatment adverse events, Post-treatment complications are recorded, 3 months|Long-term outcomes after treatment, Overall survival and progression-free survival, 1 year
Objective response rate, Tumor response, 3 months
The investigators consecutively admit patients the questionnaire and collect the fecal. And by tracking the short-term and long-term outcomes of HCC patients treated with systemic therapies,the difference of gut microbiota between responded patients and non-responded patients is analyzed, and the correlation between gut and oral microbiota and short-term and long-term results is explored.Adverse events (AE) are recorded using the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.0).Tumor response is mainly evaluated by experienced hepatologists using radiological method within 4-12 weeks after treatments according to the RECIST 1.1 and Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST).Overall survival (OS) and Progression-free survival (PFS) are recorded.
