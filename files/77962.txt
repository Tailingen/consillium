Efficacy and Safety of Combination Therapy of Sintilimab and Chemotherapy With Cryoablation in NSCLC
This study aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of immuno-chemotherapy in combination of cryoablation as the first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC
Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer
DEVICE: Cryoablation
Progression-free survival (PFS), Assessed by the investigators using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 and iRECIST. In case of any discrepancies, the investigators will consult a third party., up to 3 years
Objective response rate (ORR), Proportion of subjects whose tumors were assessed by the investigators using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 and iRECIST. In case of any discrepancies, the investigators will consult a third party., up to 3 years|Disease control rate (DCR), Proportion of subjects whose tumors were assessed as CR, PR or stable disease (SD) by the investigators using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 and iRECIST. In case of any discrepancies, the investigators will consult a third party., up to 3 year|Duration of response (DOR), The time from onset of response to progression or death due to any reason, whichever occurs earlier, up to 3 years|Safety profile, Number of participants with adverse events as a measure of safety and tolerability., up to 3 years
Expression of immune factors, Flow cytometry analysis of the expression of immune factors in peripheral blood, an average of 6 weeks since immuno-chemotherapy, and at 1, 3, and 7 days after cryoablation
This study aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of immuno-chemotherapy in combination of cryoablation as the first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC
