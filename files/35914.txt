Salvage Ovarian FANG™ Vaccine + Carboplatinum
This is a Phase II study of Vigil™ autologous tumor cell vaccine integrated with carboplatinum. All patients will have Vigil™ prepared and stored from ovarian tumor cells obtained at the time of primary surgical debulking. Patients meeting eligibility criteria will receive either carboplatinum alone (AUC 6/30 minute infusion) or carboplatinum (AUC 5/30 minute infusion) and taxol (175 mg/m2/3 hour infusion) one day prior to Vigil™ 1.0 x 10e7 cells/intradermal injection, once every 3 weeks.
Stage III Ovarian Cancer|Stage IV Ovarian Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Vigil™ Vaccine|DRUG: Carboplatinum|DRUG: Carboplatinum and Taxol
Time to Progression (TTP), Time to progression (TTP) will be determined following Carboplatinum integrated with Vigil vaccine in patients failing standard of care in study CL-PTL 105 or in those not otherwise qualifying after vaccine production. This will be measured from the treatment start date (date of first dose) to either the date the patient is first recorded as having disease recurrence (even if the patient went off treatment because of toxicity), or the date of death if the patient dies due to any causes before progression., 24 months|Response Rate, Response will be evaluated using the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline., Up to 12 months
Immune Analysis in Blood, To determine if subjects will have a positive (defined as \>10 ELISPOTS from baseline) immune response to Vigil. Blood was collected to compare ELISPOT results from baseline until 30 days after last dose., Baseline, End of Treatment (30 days after last dose) up to 12 months
Number of Alive Subjects, Survival status of patients after treatment will be determined., 24 months
