Benefit of Paramedical Care in Accompanying Caregivers of Patients That Had Surgery for an Head and Neck Invasive Cancer
Head and Neck invasive cancer usually requires surgery that is associated with modifications of the body structure of patient regarding breathing, eating and communication. These modifications are correlated with an important loss of autonomy in patients. During the study, while the patient is hospitalised after the surgery, the paramedical team will train the caregiver of the patient from experimental group a new dimension of autonomy in order to assure a safe return home. The level of learning depends on each caregiver and patient; therefore, an adapted training is provided.

This study evaluates the impact of paramedical care in accompanying caregivers of patients that had surgery for an ENT invasive cancer, by comparing the experimental group (paramedical care) to the standard group (standard care).

The hypothesis of the study is that a benefit will be seen in the experimental group, by reducing the caregiver burden, improving the quality of life of patients and lowering the rate of hospitalisations and prolonged hospitalisations in these patients.
