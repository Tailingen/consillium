This study will focus on R-DXd in participants with platinum-resistant, high-grade ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer. R-DXd is an antibody-drug conjugate that specifically binds to CDH6, which is overexpressed in tumor cells. The Phase 2 dose-optimization part of the study (Part A) intends to define the recommended dose based on safety and efficacy, while the Phase 3 (Part B) part of the study will compare R-DXd with Investigator's choice of chemotherapy and further evaluate efficacy.
