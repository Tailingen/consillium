Personalized Therapy in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
Excision repair cross complementing 1 (ERCC1) ribonucleotide reductase M1 (RRM1) and thymidylate synthase(TS) are molecular determinants that predict sensitivity or resistance to platinum agents „ÄÅ gemcitabine and pemetrexed respectively.

Tailored therapy using these molecular determinants suggested patient benefit in a previously reported phase 2 trial. Here, we designed a study for an individual patient analysis of prospectively accrued patients who were treated with the "personalized therapy" approach versus other standard approaches.
Lung Cancer|Carboplatin Adverse Reaction
DRUG: carboplatin, gemcitabine , pametrexed
The disease-free survival, The disease-free survival was measured from the day of tumor resection until tumor recurrence (progression) or death as the end point, Followed up these patients for disease-free survival for 4 years
Patients who had nonsmall- cell lung cancer (NSCLC) performance status of 0/1 were accrued to 2 phase 2 clinical trials Trial A (carboplatin and chemotherapy individuation based on sensitivity marker ), Trial B (carboplatin non-individuation or chemotherapy non-individuation ).

Patients who were treated on Trials B were analyzed as the "standard therapy" group. Patients accrued to Trial A were called the "personalized therapy" group. disease free survival (DFS) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.
