Evaluation of the Predictive Value of Blood Levels of Angiopoietin 1 and Endothelial Internal Tunica Cell Kinase 2 in Patients With Ovarian Cancer Treated With Chemotherapy Associated to Bevacizumab
This is a monocentric prospective observational pilot study of translational research in women with advanced ovarian epithelial cancer. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the predictive value of response to treatment with bevacizumab of the circulating levels of Ang1, Tie2 and VEGF before start of therapy. Secondary aims of the study are to explore the predictive value of response / resistance to bevacizumab of changes in circulating levels of Ang1 and Tie2 during treatment and at progression of disease, and to explore the possible role of circulating VEGF in the modulation of bioavailability of bevacizumab.
Ovarian Cancer
OTHER: Observational study. Blood samples will be collected at scheduled blood draws performed as per clinical practice before each cycle of chemotherapy.
