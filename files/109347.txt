A Clinical Study of Anti-CD19 Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cell Injection (CNCT19) in the Treatment of Cluster of Differentiation 19 (CD19) Positive Relapsed or Refractory B Cell Malignancies
This is a single arm, open-label, single center study to determine the safety and efficacy of CNCT19 in adult patients with Relapsed or Refractory B cell Malignancies.
Relapsed or Refractory Hematological Malignancies
BIOLOGICAL: CNCT19
Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, 24 months|Overall remission rate (ORR), 3 months
Response at Day 28±3 days, 1 month|Percentage of patients who achieve complete remission (CR) or complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) (partial remission，PR) at month 6 without SCT between CNCT19 infusion and Month 6 response assessment., 6 months|Percentage of patients who achieve CR or CRi (PR) with minimal residual disease negative bone marrow., 6 months|Relapse-free survival, 24 months|Progression-free survival, 24 months|Percentage of patients who achieve best overall response (BOR), 24 months|Duration of remission (DOR), 24 months|Overall survival, 24 months|Percentage of patient who achieve CR or CRi (PR) and then proceed to stem cell transplantation（SCT） while in remission., 24 months|Proportion of patients with detectable replication competent lentivirus (RCL) by vesicular stomatitis virus, glycoprotein (VSV-G), at Month 3 post treatment then Month 6 and Month12, yearly until year 15 if CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) transgene is still detected
This is a single arm, open-label, single-center study to determine the safety and efficacy of CNCT19 in adult patients with r/r B cell Malignancies. The study will have the following sequential phases: Screening, Pre-Treatment (Cell Product Preparation \& Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy), Treatment and Follow-up, and Survival Follow-up. The total duration of the study is 2 years from CNCT19 cell infusion.
