A Phase 2 Study of HX301 in Patients with High-grade Giloma
The study will include a dose-escalation and dose-expansion component to establish the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for HX301 in combination with Temozolomide and to evaluate the preliminary antitumor activity of HX301.HX301 is an investigational drug that has not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or any other regulatory authorities for commercial purposes.
