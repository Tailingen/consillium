Observational Study on the Patients With Rectal Cancer
The aim of this observational study is to retrospectively collect current survival data for 3995 primary rectal cancer patients who were extracted from 5097 rectal cancer patients admitted in Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences from January 2000 to December 2010. Moreover, based on a Cox model, we want to develope a nomogram that predicts local recurrence, distant metastases, and survival for patients with rectal cancer treated with pre- or postoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT).
Rectal Cancer|Adjuvant Chemoradiotherapy|Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy|Adjuvant Chemotherapy|Surgery
Overall survival, 5-10 years|Cancer-specific survival, 5-10 years|Locoregional recurrence free survival, 5-10 years|Distant metastasis free survival, 5-10 years
Chemotherapy/Radiotherapy/Chemoradiotherapy toxicities, Chemotherapy toxicities are evaluated by NCI-CTC version 3.0 and radiotherapy toxicities are graded using the RTOG/EORTC Radiation Morbidity Scoring Schema., the duration of hospital stay (an expected average of 6 weeks for chemoradiotherapy and 4-6 months for chemotherapy), as well as within 30 days after completion of the treatment and all the follow-up time|Surgery complication, within 30 days after surgery
