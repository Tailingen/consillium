A Phase II Clinical Trial of Chemo-radiotherapy in Combination With INO-3112 in Patients With Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer
The aim of this study is to assess the potential benefit of the addition of immunotherapy with VGX-3100 and INO-9012 (i.e. INO-3112) to concomitant CRT or, to concomitant CRT and continued as adjuvant in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer.

Safety run-in: To test the safety of CRT combined with immunotherapy with INO-3112. This safety run-in phase will include the first 3 patients treated in each of the two INO-3112 combination arms who are exposed to at least two immunotherapy doses and evaluate whether the combination does not pose undue immediate risks to the patients further enrolled in the trial.

Phase II:To demonstrate sufficient activity in the experimental combination arms to warrant a further phase III conclusive trial based on progression free survival (PFS) at 18 months assessed by RECIST by the local investigator. The efficacy will be assessed within each experimental arm while the standard arm will serve as a reference arm to check the reliability of the results.
Uterine Cervical Neoplasms
BIOLOGICAL: INO-3112 vaccine|RADIATION: Radiotherapy (Extrernal beam radiotherapy + brachytherapy)|DRUG: Cisplatin chemotherapy
Occurence of Adverse Events, In order to ensure adequate safety of the combination treatment, a safety run-in will be performed. This safety run-in phase will include the first 3 patients treated in each of the experimental arms (arms A \& B) exposed to at least two immunotherapy doses. The acute safety of the combination of INO-3112 with concomitant CRT will be evaluated similar to a phase I "3+3" safety design. The safety evaluation will be done by the Data Safety Monitoring Board who will invoke an IDMC evaluation of the whole study if undue safety signals are observed.

Acute toxicity is defined as a grade 3 or more related AEs occurring between the first dose of vaccine administration and up to 14 days after the second dose of immunotherapy. Adverse events are graded according to the NCI CTCAE v4.0. Use of narcotics will be reviewed on case-to-case basis by a medical review team to assess its relevance towards the safety evaluation, 6 months|Progression free survival (PFS) at 18 months assessed by RECIST, Progression Free Survival at 18 months assessed by local investigator, 18 months
