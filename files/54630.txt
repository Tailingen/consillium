Integrated PET/MRI and Germline Variants to Differentiate Brain Tumopr Recurrence From Iatrogenicchanges in Children
Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMR) is used in pediatric brain tumors for purposes of diagnosis, evaluation of response to treatments, and monitoring of patients in follow-up. Through conventional imaging techniques it remains difficult to differentiate tumor recurrence from pseudo-progression or other iatrogenic changes after radiotherapy or chemotherapy, but it remains a relevant and essential clinical need for patient management.
Pediatric Brain Tumor
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: 11C-MET-PET/RMN
MET-PET/brain MRI in children with brain tumor for diagnosis of brain tumor recurrence compared to therapy-induced changes., The role of MET-PET/MRI and radiogenomics could play in the follow-up management of children and adolescents with brain tumors and in ensuring timely intervention in case of tumor recurrence/progression., 4 years
