18F-FLT (PET/CT) in Pediatrics With Myeloproliferative Neoplasms
The Main purpose of this project to study the uptake pattern of FLT-PET and it is value in assessing the malignant hematopoiesis in MPN within the pediatric age group, in terms of diagnosis, staging and monitoring response to therapy. As well as, evaluating FLT-PET as a novel non-invasive technique in cases with MPN and its role in comparison to the standard bone marrow biopsy with regard to disease diagnosis, assessment of disease activity, detection of transformation, monitoring of treatment response and grading of fibrosis.Furthermore, we aim to study the association of FLT-PET uptake patterns with different genetic makeup (JAK2, CALR positive, MPL, or Triple negative disease) or allele burden in cases of Pre-PMF with the ability of FLT-PET to differentiate between Pre-PMF and ET.

Although MPNs are diseases of elderly, MPN is diagnosed in younger age groups in a considerable number of cases. Since most of the available data as well as current WHO classification criteria emphases on the "average" MPN patients who range in age between 55 and 65 years. Less consistent data are available in the groups of patients presenting below this median age, such as children and younger adults which we're planning to reveal.

DEVICE: Diagnostic (18F-FLT PET/CT)
Evaluate the uptake of 3'-deoxy-3'-[18F] fluorothymidine (FLT) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET) in children with MPNs, Evaluate the uptake of 3'-deoxy-3'-\[18F\] fluorothymidine (FLT) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET) imaging and it is value in assessing the malignant hematopoiesis in children with MPNs., 12 Months
Number of patients who have similar diagnosis and pattern between FLT and Bone Marrow, Assessing of WHO diagnostic criteria for diagnosing MPNs. Measurements would include: Bone marrow cellularity, trilineal assessment, megakaryocytic morphologic characteristics (atypia, clustering, size, lobulation), staging of primary myelofibrosis into prefibrotic/early stage, Primary myelofibrosis and overt fibrotic stage prefibrotic, grade of fibrosis, blast percentage, presence of transformation, intrasinusoidal hematopoiesis, dysplasia (if present)., 12 months
