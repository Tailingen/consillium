Localization of Parathyroid Adenoma by Fluorocholine PET/MRI (Positron Emission Tomography -MRI)
A comparative prospective study to evaluate different imaging modalities (pet-ct and pet-mr) prior to surgery in parathyroid tumor patients.
Primary Hyperthyroidism
DEVICE: PET-MR|DEVICE: PET-CT
Adenomas size and location, Location of adenomas by a report analyzing the pathological examination (PET-CT/PET-MR output)., 24 months
Parathyroid hormone levels, approval late addition level of parathyroid hormone (PTH) before and during the course of the operation after the conclusion of adenomas (Hormone levels)., 24 months|Chronic disease duration, time from chronic diseases indication and duration of symptoms measured in months (from the medical records)., 24 months|Disease related medication consumption, Disease related medication consumption measured in miligram (mg) for each medication (from medical records)., 24 months
Patients with Hyperthyroidism and surgery indication will be recruited and directed to imagine exams. in addition to the conservative 99mTc-MIBI (methoxyisobutylisonitrile) and US, patients will also undergo 18FCH (¹⁸F-choline) PET/MRI for detecting adenomas and their location. imaging experts will decode the imaging exams. sensitivity and specificity of the exams will be examined.
