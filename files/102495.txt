A Safety, Tolerability and PK Study of DCC-2618 in Patients With Advanced Malignancies
This is a Phase 1, open-label, first-in-human (FIH) dose-escalation study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary antitumor activity of DCC-2618, administered orally (PO), in adult patients with advanced malignancies. The study consists of 2 parts, a dose-escalation phase, and an expansion phase. All active patients (from both dose-escalation and expansion phases) will then transition into an extension phase.

DRUG: DCC-2618|DRUG: DCC-2618
Safety/tolerability of oral DCC-2618: incidence of adverse events, Dose limiting toxicities, AEs, SAEs, discontinuation of drug due to toxicity, physical exams and ECOG PS, ophthalmologic examinations, changes from baseline in laboratory parameters, electrocardiograms, LVEF, and vital signs., Approximately 24 months|Determination of the Maximum Tolerated Dose and the Recommended Phase 2 Dose, 18 months|Expansion Phase: Assess Antitumor Activity of DCC-2618 in all diseases, Objective response rate (ORR); Disease control rate (DCR), Approximately 24 months
Determine the PK profile of oral DCC-2618, Predose and up to 24 hours postdose (Cycle = 28 Days)|Escalation Phase: Assess Antitumor Activity of DCC-2618 in patients with advanced malignancies, Objective response rate (ORR); Disease control rate (DCR), Approximately 24 months
