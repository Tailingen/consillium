Circulating Tumor Cells in Lung Cancer
TITLE : Circulating tumor cells identification in advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer (CIRCUBRONCH)

BACKGROUND : Circulating tumor cells identification is a new field of research in oncology, and some studies have been conducted with success on breast and prostate cancer. Nearly 80% of lung cancers are diagnosed in an advanced stage (IIIB, and IV). Circulating tumor cells identification and monitoring these cells after treatment could help the clinicians to detect relapse or be a prognostic factor.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : Circulating tumor cells identification, and monitoring in advanced stage lung cancers (IIIB and IV).

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : Predictive value of the monitoring of circulating tumor cells on the therapeutic response. Prognostic value of identification of circulating tumor cells at the time of diagnosis.

STUDY DESIGN : This study is a prospective, monocentrique trial analyzing the identification of circulating tumor cells in stage IIIB, and IV non-small cell lung cancers.

Duration of the inclusions: 54 months.

Duration of the study: 66 months.

PROCEDURES : Detection of circulating tumor cells with CellSearch system (Veridex), and a cut-off of 5 cells/7,5 ml of blood.

SAMPLE SIZE : 200 patients

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS : Detection of circulating tumor cells is predicted in 20% of stage IIIB, and IV non-small cell lung cancers included in this study. The cut-off is 5 circulating tumor cells per 7,5 ml of blood.
Stage IIIB Non Small Cell Lung Cancer|Stage IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
