Docetaxel in Treating Patients With Stage II or Stage III Prostate Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of docetaxel in treating patients who have stage II or stage III prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: docetaxel
Complete Response Rate, Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test, 2 Months, 6 Months
Percentage of Participants with mild to moderate toxicity, 6 months
OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the pathologic complete response rate to docetaxel in patients with high risk stage II or III prostate cancer. II. Determine the toxicity of this treatment in these patients. III. Correlate clinical measures of response (e.g., symptoms, physical exam, serum PSA, and endorectal MRI) with pathologic response to this treatment in these patients.

OUTLINE: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 30 minutes weekly for 4 weeks. Treatment continues for 2-6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-45 patients will be accrued for this study over 18 months.
