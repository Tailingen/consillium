Irinotecan Liposome，Albumin Paclitaxel and Gemcitabine First-line Treatment for Pancreatic Cancer
This is a Phase I/II , Open-label , Investigator-initiated Trail of liposomal irinotecan,nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine as First-line Treatment in Advanced pancreatic cancer. The study was designed in two stages, the first stage was the tolerance observation stage, and the second stage was the curative effect expansion stage.

The first part of the study is the Dose-finding Phase designed to establish the safety of nab-paclitaxel，gemcitabine and liposomal irinotecan at different dose Levels(40 mg/m2, iv. q2w or 60 mg/m2, iv. q2w). The second part of the study is the Expansion Phase designed to generate additional clinical data at specified doses .

This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of liposomal irinotecan，nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine in the First-line treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer.

Progression free Survival, Defined as the time between signing the informed consent form to the disease progression (according to RECIST v1.1 criteria) or death due to any cause., 1 year|Overall survival, Defined as the time between signing the informed consent form to death due to various causes., 2 years|Disease Control Rate, Defined as the proportion of patients who achieved complete response (CR), partial response (PR), and stable disease (SD) according to RECIST v1.1., 6 months|Incidence of adverse events, Use NCI-CTCAE version 5.0 for classification and grading, 6 months
The study consists of a dose escalation and expansion phase to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for liposomal irinotecan combination with AG, and a dose confirmation phase which will further characterize the treatment of liposomal irinotecan in combination at the RP2D.
