PH III Study of Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone With or Without Elotuzumab to Treat Previously Untreated Multiple Myeloma (ELO 1 Substudy)
The purpose of the study is to look at subjects who receive Lenalidomide, Dexamethasone, and Elotuzumab and determine if they will have lower surface CS1 expression on malignant plasma cells at the time of progression than those who receive Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone without Elotuzumab
Newly Diagnosed, Previously Untreated Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Lenalidomide|DRUG: Dexamethasone|BIOLOGICAL: Elotuzumab
Change From Baseline to Progression of the Cell Surface Expression of CS1 From Bone Marrow-Derived Multiple Myeloma (MM) Cells, CS1 (CD2 subset-1, also known as CRACC, SLAMF7, CD319) expression levels in multiple myeloma cells were analyzed from bone-marrow aspirates collected at baseline and at time of progression through mean fluorescent intensity.

The following conditions were considered to describe multiple myeloma cells expressing CS1 (CS1+/CD38++/CD138+/CD56+/CD19-/CD45DIM), From baseline (screening) to time of progression (up to approximately 54 months)
Percent of Bone Marrow-Derived Multiple Myeloma (MM) Cells Expressing Cell Surface CS1 at Time of Progression, CS1 (CD2 subset-1, also known as CRACC, SLAMF7, CD319) expression levels in multiple myeloma cells were analyzed from bone-marrow aspirates collected at time of progression.

The following conditions were considered to describe multiple myeloma cells expressing CS1 (CS1+/CD38++/CD138+/CD56+/CD19-/CD45DIM), Time of progression (up to approximately 54 months from pre-treatment screening)|Levels of CS1 Soluble Form (sCS1) in Serum, Expression levels of the free form of soluble CS1 were analyzed at different timepoints from serum samples derived from peripheral blood collection, At baseline (screening), during main study therapy (cycle 3 day 1, up to 64 days) and at time of progression (up to approximately 31 months)|Change From Baseline in the Levels of CS1 Soluble Form (sCS1) in Serum During Therapy and At Progression, Expression levels of the free form of soluble CS1 were analyzed at different timepoints from serum samples derived from peripheral blood collection, From baseline (screening) to cycle 3 day 1 of the main study therapy (up to 64 days) and from baseline (screening) to time of progression (up to approximately 31 months)|Change From Baseline in the Number of Circulating Multiple Myeloma (MM) Cells, Circulating MM cells isolated from peripheral blood, From baseline (screening) to cycle 3 day 1 of the main study therapy (up to 64 days) and from baseline (screening) to the time of progression (up to approximately 54 months)|Change From Baseline in Cell Surface CS1 Expression Levels in Circulating Multiple Myeloma (MM) Cells, Circulating MM cells isolated from peripheral blood, From baseline (screening) to cycle 3 day 1 of the main study therapy (up to 64 days) and from baseline (screening) to the time of progression (up to approximately 54 months)|CS1 Expression Levels in Matched Samples of Bone Marrow-Derived Multiple Myeloma (MM) Cells and Circulating MM Cells, CS1 expression levels analyzed from matching bone marrow aspirates (for bone marrow-derived MM cells) and from peripheral blood (for circulating tumor cells) collected from the same participants, At baseline (screening), during main study therapy (cycle 3 day 1) and at time of progression (up to approximately 54 months)
