PD-L1 Expression in Cancer (PECan Study).
Measurement of PD-L1 expression in cancer to monitor treatment response.

A prospective non-blinded, single centre, single interventional arm diagnostic imaging study.

To determine the baseline level and variability within and between patients and tumour types of PD-L1 expression in melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer in immunotherapy na√Øve patients using \[99mTc\]-anti-PD-L1 SPECT/CT and immunohistochemistry.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer|Melanoma
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: [99mTc]-NM-01 SPECT/CT
Percentage change in PD-L1 expression (using [99mTc] SPECT) in NSCLC., PD-L1 expression reported by measurement of tumour:blood pool ratio and/or SUV of \[99mTc\]-anti-PD-L1-sdAb uptake on SPECT. Measurement at baseline and 9 weeks will be compared to determine % change.

Standard clinical imaging assessment at 9 and 18 weeks used as comparators., Up to 18 weeks|Percentage change in PD-L1 expression (using [99mTc] SPECT) in melanoma lesions., PD-L1 expression reported by measurement of tumour:blood pool ratio and/or SUV of \[99mTc\]-anti-PD-L1-sdAb uptake on SPECT. Measurement at baseline and 12 weeks will be compared to determine % change.

Standard clinical imaging assessment at 12 and 24 weeks used as comparators., Up to 24 weeks
Report PD-L1 tumour expression (using [99mTc] SPECT) of immunotherapy naive participants compared to PD-L1 expression determine by standard immunohistochemistry., Correlation between PD-L1 expression reported by measurement of tumour:blood pool ratio and/or SUV of \[99mTc\]-anti-PD-L1-sdAb uptake on SPECT and PD-L1 expression determined by standard of care immunohistochemistry., Baseline
Using \[99mTc\]-labeled anti-PD-L1 single-domain antibody, this study aims to prospectively measure changes in PD-L1 expression determined with SPECT/CT imaging and correlate these changes with response to anti-PD(L)1 immunotherapy.
