Enteral Nutrition After Pancreaticoduodenectomy
Pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) is the treatment of choice for resectable periampullary cancer. PD is still associated with a relatively a high incidence of delayed gastric emptying. And, there are no acknowledged strategies to avoid DGE. Several feeding strategies have been investigated to cope with this problem. However, there is still no consensus concerning the best nutrition support method after pancreaticoduodenectomy. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of nutrition support methods on DGE after pancreaticoduodenectomy: early enteral nutrition or total parenteral nutrition.

Patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy will be randomized to receive early enteral nutrition (EN group), or Saline administration (Saline group), or oral intake only (Natural control). The EN group will receive standard enteral diet administered through a nasojejunal tube. Enteral nutrition will be started on the 1st postoperative day and increased daily by 20-40 ml up to the estimated level. The Saline group will receive saline administered through a nasojejunal tube beginning from the 1st postoperative day. Oral intake will not be restricted in all three group.

Incident rate of delayed gastric emptying, DGE represents the inability to return to a standard diet by the end of the first postoperative week and includes prolonged nasogastric intubation of the patient. Three different grades (A,B,and C) were defined based on the impact on the clinical course and on postoperative management by ISGPS., 30 days
