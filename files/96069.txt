Interval Between Neoadjuvant Therapy and Surgery in the Treatment of Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer (CRONOS)
The investigators evaluate the response of rectal cancer to neoadjuvant therapy and classify the response according to specific periods of time after the end of neoadjuvant treatment.
Rectal Cancer|Neoadjuvant Therapy
PROCEDURE: Interval between NAT and surgery
Pathological response, Grade as complete, 2000-2019|Circumferential margin (CRM), Described as free (CRM \>1 mm), 2000-2019|Distal resection margin (DRM), Described as free (DRM \>1 mm), 2000-2019|Quality of the specimen, Described as complete or incomplete, 2000-2019
In the treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer, an optimal interval between neoadjuvant therapy and surgery might improve oncological outcomes. Besides, those patients who achieve a good response might benefit from active surveillance, avoiding surgical comorbidities. This optimal interval is yet to be defined. This study will aim to better define the role of time interval between the end of neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) and TME in Spanish regions, together with analyzing the importance of restaging MRI and define the basis for implementing a "watch and wait" protocol.
