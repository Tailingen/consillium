A Phase 1b/2 Study of OMP-59R5 (Tarextumab) in Combination With Nab-Paclitaxel and Gemcitabine in Subjects With Previously Untreated Stage IV Pancreatic Cancer
The study consists of a Phase1b lead-in portion to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of OMP-59R5 in combination with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine followed by a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled portion to evaluate the efficacy and safety of OMP-59R5 in combination with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine in subjects with previously untreated stage IV pancreatic cancer.
Stage IV Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: OMP-59R5|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Nab-Paclitaxel
Phase Ib: Number of Participants With Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLT), Number of participants with dose-limiting toxicities when administered OMP-59R5 every of other week (Days 1 and 15) in combination with nab-paclitaxel (Nab-P) 125 mg/m2 and gemcitabine (Gem) 1000 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8, and 15 of every 28-day cycle in subjects with previously untreated stage IV pancreatic cancer. In the event that no DLTs are observed, maximum tested dose would be considered the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)., Up to 1 year in absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.|Phase 2: Overall Survival (ITT Population), To determine the clinical benefit, as measured by overall survival (OS) ofthe addition of OMP-59R5 to nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine in all subjects who are receiving first-line therapy for stage IV pancreatic cancer., Up to 1 year in absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.|Phase 2: Median OS by Notch 3 Percentile (ITT Population), To determine the clinical benefit, as measured by OS of the addition of OMP-59R5 to Nab-P+Gem across the 4 subject subsets: subjects with Notch3 ≥ 25th percentile, subjects with Notch3 ≥ 50th percentile, subjects with Notch3 ≥ 75th percentile and all subjects receiving first-line therapy for stage IV pancreatic cancer with Notch3 high expression level., Up to 1 year in absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.
