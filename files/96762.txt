Study of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in Participants With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC)(MK-3475-199/KEYNOTE-199)
This is a study of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in participants with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Participants will be enrolled into one of five cohorts: Cohort 1 (participants with programmed cell death ligand 1 \[PD-L1\]-positive, measurable disease), Cohort 2 (participants with PD-L1 negative, measurable disease), Cohort 3 (participants with bone-metastases and non-measurable disease) post-chemotherapy, Cohort 4 (participants with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1- \[RECIST 1.1\]-measureable disease) and Cohort 5 (participants with bone metastases only or bone-predominant disease) pre-chemotherapy.

Participants without PSA progression were censored at the last PSA assessment date. PSA progression was defined as the date that an increase of 25% or more and an absolute increase of 2 ng/mL or more from the nadir were documented. For participants who had a decline in PSA during treatment, PSA progression must have been confirmed by a second value 3 or more weeks later increased with respect to the nadir PSA.

Participants with mCRPC previously treated with docetaxel-based chemotherapy in Cohorts 1 to 3 will receive monotherapy with pembrolizumab. Chemotherapy-naïve subjects with mCRPC either having failed or showing signs of failure with enzalutamide in Cohorts 4 and 5 will receive pembrolizumab monotherapy in addition to their current regimen of enzalutamide. In all cohorts, pembrolizumab administration will occur on Day 1 of each 3-week dosing cycle and will continue for a maximum of 35 cycles (approximately 2 years) unless specific withdrawal/discontinuation criteria are met. Participants who discontinue after 35 infusions of pembrolizumab for reasons other than disease progression or intolerability, or who discontinue after attaining a complete response may be eligible for up to 17 additional infusions (approximately 1 year) after they have experienced disease progression.
