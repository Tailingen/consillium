Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics Study of TQB3702 Tablets in Hematologic Tumor Subjects
This project is an open, dose escalation and expansion phase I clinical study. The first phase is a dose escalation study, and the second phase is a dose expansion study based on the Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) / Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) obtained in the first phase. The purpose is to evaluate the tolerability and preliminary efficacy of TQB3702 tablets in hematological tumor subjects.
