Paclitaxel Liposome and Cisplatin as First-line Chemotherapy in Patients With Metastatic Esophageal Cancer
There are no standard chemotherapy regimens for metastatic esophageal cancer. Cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil is widely used as first-line treatment with a response rate ranged from 30% to 40%. Combination of paclitaxel and cisplatin has been investigated in small size clinical trial, producing promising outcome.Liposome capsuled paclitaxel has been proved to be as effective as paclitaxel.The usefulness of the the regimen of paclitaxel liposome with cisplatin is evaluated by median survival time, progression free survival,and response rate.
