Application of Thrombin Gel Matrix for the Prevention of Lymphocele in Patients With Endometrial Cancer.
To compare the incidence of lymphocele in Endometrial cancer patients with thrombin gel matrix used and not used during pelvic lymph node dissection.
Lymphocele|Lymphocele After Surgical Procedure|Endometrium Cancer
DRUG: Thrombi-Gel|PROCEDURE: Conventional Pelvic lymphadenectomy

Pelvic lymph node dissection is the most accurate staging tool to determine lymph node involvement in endometrial cancer. Lymphoceles developed after surgery can cause serious morbidity, additional costs and delays in chemotherapy or radiotherapy. In this study, conventional pelvic lymphadenectomy will be compared with thrombin gel matrix application after pelvic lymphadenectomy. Our goal is to prospectively assess the lymphostatic effect of thrombin gel matrix in endometrial cancer patients undergoing pelvic lymph node dissection.
