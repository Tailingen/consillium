Study of Docetaxel/Gemcitabine Followed by Chemo-radiotherapy (Chemo-RT), With or Without Consolidation Chemotherapy, in IIIA/IIIB Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
The combination of chemotherapy with radiotherapy remains the standard of therapy for patients with stage III NSCLC. A recent phase II study has presented encouraging data regarding the administration of docetaxel as consolidation treatment after definitive concurrent chemo-radiotherapy.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Carboplatin|RADIATION: Chemoradiotherapy|DRUG: Docetaxel
Time to tumor progression (TTP), 1 year
Response rate, Objective responses confirmed by CT or MRI (on 3rd and 6th cycle)|Overall survival, Probability of 1-year survival (%)|Toxicity, Toxicity assessment on each chemotherapy cycle|Quality of life, Assessment every two cycles|Symptom improvement, Assessment every two cycles
To evaluate whether the administration of consolidation therapy with docetaxel/carboplatin after induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy, offers any advantage regarding time to tumor progression
