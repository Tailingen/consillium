dTACE-HAIC Combined With Bevacizumab and Atezolizumab for Huge Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This study intends to evaluate the efficacy and safety of drug-eluting transcatheter arterial embolization-hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy of oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin (dTACE-HAIC) plus Bevacizumab and Atezolizumab for patients with intermediate-advanced huge hepatocellular carcinoma.

PROCEDURE: dTACE-HAIC
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR, as determined based on tumor response according to RECIST 1.1, is defined as the proportion of all included patients whose best overall response (BOR) is either a complete response or partial response., 12 months
Progression-Free-Survival (PFS), PFS is the length of time from the date of inclusion until tumor progression., 12 months|Overall survival (OS), OS is the length of time from the date of inclusion until death from any cause., 24 months
Drug-eluting transcatheter arterial embolization (dTACE) and hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) of oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin are effective and safe for hepatocellular carcinoma. Atezolizumab + Bevacizumab was superior to sorafenib in overall survival in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. The anti-VEGF combined programmed cell death protein-1 legend 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor were effective and tolerable in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. We aimed to describe the efficacy and safety of locoregional therapy (dTACE/HAIC) combined with Bevacizumab and Atezolizumab inhibitor in patients with huge hepatocellular carcinoma who can not receive radical therapy.
