Safety and Efficacy of Repeated Infusion of CELYVIR in Children and Adults With Metastatic and Refractory Tumors.
The investigators will evaluate the safety of weekly infusions (n=6) of CELYVIR in children and adults with metastatic and refractory solid tumors. CELYVIR consists in bone marrow-derived autologous mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) infected with ICOVIR5, an oncolytic adenovirus. In addition to data on toxicities the investigators will evaluate clinical response.
