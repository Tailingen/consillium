A Phase 1b Open-Label Study Investigating the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Administration of Subcutaneous Blinatumomab for the Treatment of Relapsed/Refractory Indolent Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
Primary Objective:

• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of subcutaneous (SC) blinatumomab dose administrations

Secondary Objectives:

* To determine pharmacokinetics (PK) with continuous intravenous (cIV) and SC administrations
* To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) tested for blinatumomab administered subcutaneously
* To determine the incidence of anti-blinatumomab antibody formation following SC administration
* To evaluate efficacy response following treatment with SC blinatumomab administration

Exploratory Objective:

* To determine the pharmacodynamics (PD) time profiles for B-and T-lymphocytes as well as cytokine profiles during SC administration
* To evaluate efficacy response following treatment with SC blinatumomab administration using Lugano criteria if positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) is used for evaluation
Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
DRUG: blinatumomab
Number of Participants With Dose Limiting-Toxicities (DLTs) After SC Administration, The occurrence of any of the following toxicities during the DLT evaluation period was considered a DLT, if judged by the investigator to be related to the administration of blinatumomab:

* Death
* Any toxicity, regardless of grade, that lead to a participant's removal from the study by the investigator and/or sponsor
* Persistent Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade \>/= 2 non-hematologic adverse events (AEs) that were deemed intolerable by the participant or the treating physician and that did not respond to appropriate medical management within 5 days and lead to treatment discontinuation
* Recurrent grade 2 seizures
* All grade 3 and 4 AEs and laboratory abnormalities, which occurred during the SC administration portion of the treatment period with exceptions noted in protocol section 6.2.1.2.3., Day 1 to Day 7 of Week 4|Number of Participants With DLTs CTCAE Grade ≥ 3 After SC Administration, All toxicities were graded using the CTCAE version 4.0: Grade 1 = mild; Grade 2 = moderate; Grade 3 = severe; Grade 4 = life-threatening; Grade 5 = fatal., Day 1 to Day 7 of Week 4|Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) After SC Administration, An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant. The AE did not necessarily have a causal relationship with study treatment. The definition of AEs included worsening of a pre-existing medical condition.

TEAEs included AEs starting on or after first dose of investigational product and up to the end of study date. All AEs were graded using the CTCAE version 4.0: Grade 1 = mild; Grade 2 = moderate; Grade 3 = severe; Grade 4 = life-threatening; Grade 5 = fatal., Day 1 to end of study (approximately 17 weeks)
Steady State Serum Concentration (Css) of Blinatumomab After cIV Administration, Summarized as the observed concentrations collected after 5 half-lives after the start of the IV infusion of each dose (i.e., 9, 28 and 112 μg/day)., Once at any timepoint during Day 2 of Weeks 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6|Systemic Clearance (CL) of Blinatumomab After cIV Administration, Calculated as CL=R0/Css; where R0 is the infusion rate (μg/hr) and Css is the average Css.

* CR: disappearance of all evidence of disease.
* PR: regression of measurable disease and no new sites.

The 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using Clopper-Pearson exact CI. Participants were considered as non-responders if there was no response assessment available., Day 1 to end of study (approximately 17 weeks)
