Phase 2 Study of Bexxar in Relapsed/Refractory DLCL
The purpose of this study is to obtain safety and efficacy data using Bexxar in patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large cell Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (DLCL).
Lymphoma
DRUG: Bexxar|DRUG: Acetaminophen|DRUG: Diphenhydramine|DRUG: Potassium Iodide (KI)
Clinical Response Rate, Clinical response rate for all participants, reported as the sum of the numbers of patients achieving complete response (CR, complete disappearance of all lesions); functional CR (fCR, minimal residual disease but clear of disease by positron emission tomography (PET)-scan); or partial response (PR, â‰¥ decrease in size of lesions and negative for active disease by PET-scan). Progressive disease (PD, advancing cancer) or stable disease (not CR, fCR, or PD) not included as Clinical Response., 6 years
Time to Progression (TTP), Time of disease progression reported as the number of subjects experiencing disease progression at the time point of progression., 1.5 months; 3 months; 6 months; or Not Progressed|Overall Survival (OS) Rate, Overall survival reported as the percentage of participants (less lost-to-follow-up) surviving at 6 years., 6 years
There is a lack of efficacious treatment options for patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large cell Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (DLCL) who are not appropriate candidates for stem cell transplantation. DLCL is a relatively radiosensitive disease and patients with DLCL have been reported to respond to anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (MAB) therapy. Therefore, radioimmunotherapy targeting CD20 is a rational and promising therapeutic approach for this patient population.

This study evaluated if Bexxar is safe and efficacious for diffuse large cell Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
