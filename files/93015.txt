A Study of Opevesostat (MK-5684) in China Participants With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) (MK-5684-001)
The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of opevesostat in the treatment of male Chinese participants with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of opevesostat. There are no formal hypotheses to be tested in this study.

Number of Participants Who Experience an Adverse Event (AE), An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in a participant, whether or not considered drug related. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product and does not imply any judgment about causality., Up to approximately 20 months|Number of Participants Who Discontinue Study Intervention Due to an AE, An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in a participant, whether or not considered drug related. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product and does not imply any judgment about causality., Up to approximately 20 months|Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of opevesostat, Blood samples will be collected at pre-specified timepoints to determine the Cmax of opevesostat., Day 1 and Day 8: predose and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 12 hours postdose, Day 29, Day 57, and Day 89: pre-dose|Time to Maximum Plasma Concentration (Tmax) of opevesostat, Blood samples will be collected at pre-specified timepoints to determine the Tmax of opevesostat., Day 1 and Day 8: predose and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 12 hours postdose, Day 29, Day 57, and Day 89: pre-dose|Area Under the Curve from Time 0 to 12 hours postdose (AUC0-12) of opevesostat, Blood samples will be collected at pre-specified timepoints to determine the AUC0-12 of opevesostat., Day 1 and Day 8: predose and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 12 hours postdose, Day 29, Day 57, and Day 89: pre-dose|Apparent Volume of Distribution (Vz/F) of opevesostat, Blood samples will be collected at pre-specified timepoints to determine the Vz/F of opevesostat., Day 1 and Day 8: predose and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 12 hours postdose, Day 29, Day 57, and Day 89: pre-dose|Oral Clearance (CL/F) of opevesostat, Blood samples will be collected at pre-specified timepoints to determine the CL/F of opevesostat., Day 1 and Day 8: predose and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 12 hours postdose, Day 29, Day 57, and Day 89: pre-dose|Half-Life (t1/2) of opevesostat, Blood samples will be collected at pre-specified timepoints to determine the t1/2 of opevesostat., Day 1 and Day 8: predose and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 12 hours postdose, Day 29, Day 57, and Day 89: pre-dose
Prostate-specific Antigen (PSA) Response Rate, The PSA response rate is defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population with a reduction in PSA level of ≥50% measured twice ≥3 weeks apart., Up to approximately 37 months|Radiographic Progression-free Survival (rPFS) Per Prostate Cancer Working Group (PCWG)-modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), rPFS is defined as the time from first dose of study intervention to radiographic progression per PCWG-modified RECIST 1.1 as assessed by the investigator OR death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 37 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR) Per PCWG-modified RECIST 1.1, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who have a best overall response of either confirmed Complete Response (CR: disappearance of all target lesions) or a confirmed Partial Response (PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per PCWG-modified RECIST 1.1 as assessed by the investigator., Up to approximately 37 months|Duration of Response (DOR) Per PCWG-modified RECIST 1.1, For participants who demonstrate a confirmed Complete Response (CR: disappearance of all target lesions) or Partial Response (PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per PCWG-modified RECIST 1.1, DOR is defined as the time from first documented evidence of confirmed CR or PR until disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 37 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as time from first dose of study intervention to death due to any cause., Up to approximately 37 months|Blood Concentrations of Steroids, Blood samples collected at multiple timepoints after the administration of opevesostat will be used to determine the blood concentrations of steroids., At designated timepoints (up to approximately 37 months)
