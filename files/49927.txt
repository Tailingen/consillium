PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Identify Asian American adults newly diagnosed with colorectal, liver, or lung cancer using a population-based cancer registry.

II. Conduct outreach to these patients to let them know about the availability of information on these cancers, the Patient Cancer OUtreach, Navigation, Technology and Support (COUNTS) web portal, and the Patient COUNTS patient navigation program.

III. Provide patient navigation either virtually or in-person.

OUTLINE:

Patients attend focus groups to help develop patient portal and navigation program. Patients use in-person navigation program. In phase II, patients use an online portal to access navigation program and may choose to have online/virtual navigation support or in-person navigation support. Patients also complete data collection and surveys over 15 minutes via web portal at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months and user experience survey at end of program participation.
