Number of Participants With Solicited Local Adverse Events (AEs), Number of participants with solicited local AEs were reported. Solicited local AE's included pain/tenderness, erythema, and induration/swelling., Up to 7 days after each vaccination (Up to Day 64)|Number of Participants With Solicited Systemic AEs, Number of participants with solicited systemic AEs were reported. Solicited systemic AEs included headache, fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, chills, and fever., Up to 7 days after each vaccination (Up to Day 64)|Number of Participants With Unsolicited AEs, Number of participants with unsolicited AEs were reported. Unsolicited AEs included all AEs for which the participant was not specifically questioned in the participant diary., 28 days after each vaccination (Up to Day 85)|Number of Participants With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Number of participants with SAEs were reported. SAE is any AE that results in: death, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, is life-threatening experience, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect and may jeopardize participant and/or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above., Up to 12 months after the first vaccination (target visit Day 366)
Percentage of Participants With Human Papillomavirus (HPV)-Specific CD4+ T-cell Responses: Interferon (IFN)g+, Percentage of participants with HPV-Specific CD4+ T-cell responses for IFNg+ to peptide pools were reported. Cellular immunogenicity was measured by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS), allowing characterization of individual CD4 and CD8 T cell immune responses to vaccination. The different peptide pools for HPV16 or HPV 18 were: E2, E6/E7 and combined (E2 and E6/E7 both)., Day 57, Day 78, Day 239, and Day 366|Percentage of Participants With HPV-Specific CD4+ T-cell Responses: Interleukin (IL)2+, Percentage of participants with HPV-Specific CD4+ T-cell responses for IL2+ were reported. Cellular immunogenicity was measured by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS), allowing characterization of individual CD4 and CD8 T cell immune responses to vaccination. The different peptide pools for HPV16 or HPV 18 were: E2, E6/E7 and combined (E2 and E6/E7 both)., Day 57, Day 78, Day 239, and Day 366|Percentage of Participants With HPV-Specific CD4+ T-cell Responses: Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)a+, Percentage of participants with HPV-Specific CD4+ T-cell responses for TNF a+ were reported. Cellular immunogenicity was measured by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS), allowing characterization of individual CD4 and CD8 T cell immune responses to vaccination. The different peptide pools for HPV16 or HPV 18 were: E2, E6/E7 and combined (E2 and E6/E7 both)., Day 57, Day 78, Day 239, and Day 366|Percentage of Participants With HPV-Specific CD8+ T-cell Responses: IFNg+, Percentage of participants with HPV-Specific CD8+ T-cell responses for IFNg+ were reported. Cellular immunogenicity was measured by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS), allowing characterization of individual CD4 and CD8 T cell immune responses to vaccination. The different peptide pools for HPV16 or HPV 18 were: E2, E6/E7 and combined (E2 and E6/E7 both)., Day 57, Day 78, Day 239, and Day 366|Percentage of Participants With HPV-Specific CD8+ T-cell Responses: IL2+, Percentage of participants with HPV-Specific CD8+ T-cell responses for IL2+ were reported. Cellular immunogenicity was measured by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS), allowing characterization of individual CD4 and CD8 T cell immune responses to vaccination. The different peptide pools for HPV16 or HPV 18 were: E2, E6/E7 and combined (E2 and E6/E7 both)., Day 57, Day 78, Day 239, and Day 366|Percentage of Participants With HPV-Specific CD8+ T-cell Responses: TNFa+, Percentage of participants with HPV-Specific CD8+ T-cell responses for TNFa+ were reported. Cellular immunogenicity was measured by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS), allowing characterization of individual CD4 and CD8 T cell immune responses to vaccination. The different peptide pools for HPV16 or HPV 18 were: E2, E6/E7 and combined (E2 and E6/E7 both)., Day 57, Day 78, Day 239, and Day 366
This study is part of a vaccine program which aims to generate a therapeutic vaccine for women with HPV types 16 or 18 infection, with a focus on early disease interception. The study consists of 3 periods: Screening period of up to 42 days (6 weeks), followed by prime and boost immunizations and follow-up visits up to 12 months after the first vaccination. Evaluation of the safety/reactogenicity of the vaccine regimens will include physical assessment by study-site personnel, participant reports on signs and symptoms and laboratory assessments following vaccinations. Immunogenicity and Virology/Histology assessments will also be performed.
