Sensitivity/Specificity Study of Non-invasive Imaging for Melanoma Diagnosis
The purpose of this study is to show how well a new device, confocal microscope, works to detect malignant melanoma, a type of skin cancer.
Melanoma
DEVICE: VivaScope System
Sensitivity of confocal microscope to improve melanoma detection, Determine the sensitivity of confocal microscopy in the diagnosis of melanoma by comparison to the gold standard histopathologic diagnosis., Up to 1 year|Specificity of the confocal microscope to improve melanoma detection, Determine the specificity of confocal microscopy in the diagnosis of melanoma by comparison to the gold standard histopathologic diagnosis, Up to 1 year
Patterns seen on the confocal image, Evaluate and confirm patterns seen on the confocal image, which are characteristic of melanoma and atypical nevi:

A) Pagetoid melanoma cells: melanocytes in suprabasal areas of the epidermis B) Irregular dermal-epidermal junction, Up to 1 year
