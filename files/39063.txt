Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for Unresectable Pancreatic Cancer
This study will evaluate the local control rate as well as acute and late toxicity rates of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for the treatment of unresectable pancreatic cancer.
Pancreatic Cancer
RADIATION: Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy
Local Control Rate, Local recurrence is defined as tumor recurrence within the planning target volume. Local control rate will be evaluated by imaging techniques such as CT or MRI. Local recurrence will be defined as an increase of \> 20% in tumor size. If necessary, a Positron Emission Tomography scan may be used to aid in diagnoses of local tumor recurrence., 5 years
Late Toxicity Rate, Toxicities will be graded using CTCAE criteria at specified timepoints., 5 years
This is a single institution, non-randomized, prospective, phase IV trial of SBRT for unresectable pancreatic cancer.

Data collected will include patient demographics, pathology data, tumor stage, SBRT dose fractionation scheme, dose received by adjacent critical normal tissues, tumor recurrence data, and acute and late toxicities.

Follow up data will be collected during the patient's standard office visits. The anticipated duration of this study is 5 years.
