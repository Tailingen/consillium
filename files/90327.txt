A Study Evaluating ABT-199 in Multiple Myeloma Subjects Who Are Receiving Bortezomib and Dexamethasone as Standard Therapy
The primary objectives of this study are to assess the safety profile, characterize pharmacokinetics (PK) and determine the dosing schedule, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and the recommended phase two dose (RPTD) of ABT-199 when administered in subjects with relapsed /refactory multiple myeloma who are receiving bortezomib and dexamethasone as their standard therapy.
Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: ABT-199|DRUG: bortezomib|DRUG: dexamethasone
Determination of peak concentration (Cmax) of ABT-199, Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis of ABT-199 will be collected at designated timepoints, Approximately 5 days in Cycle 1 then on Day 1 of Cycles 2,4,6,8|Determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and recommended phase two dose (RPTD) of ABT-199, ABT-199 will be dose-escalated until the largest dose is reached that is determined to be safe based on adverse event reporting and dose-limiting toxicities information from all subjects., Minimum first cycle of dosing (21 days)|Number of participants with adverse events, Collect all adverse events at each visit., From subject's first dose of ABT-199 until 30 days after subject's last dose of ABT-199; up to 2 years following last subject first dose.|Determination of trough concentration (Ctrough) of ABT-199, Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis of ABT-199 will be collected at designated timepoints, Approximately 5 days in Cycle 1 then on Day 1 of Cycles 2,4,6,8|Determination of area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) of ABT-199, Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis of ABT-199 will be collected at designated timepoints, Approximately 5 days in Cycle 1 then on Day 1 of Cycles 2,4,6,8|Determine recommended phase two dose (RPTD) of ABT-199, ABT-199 will be dose-escalated until the largest dose is reached that is determined to be safe based on adverse event reporting and dose-limiting toxicities information from all subjects., Minimum first cycle of dosing (21 days
Duration of Response, Number of days from the day of initial response is objectively documented to the day that disease progression is objectively documented, Measured up to 48 months after the last subject has enrolled in the study|Objective Response Rate, The proportion of subjects with response using International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) response criteria will be computed for all subjects with active disease at baseline (in the opinion of the investigator), Measured up to 48 months after the last subject has enrolled in the study|Time to Disease Progression, Number of days from the date of the first dose of ABT-199 to the date of the subject's disease progression., Measured up to 48 months after the last subject has enrolled in the study
