INFORM2 Study Uses Nivolumab and Entinostat in Children and Adolescents With High-risk Refractory Malignancies
The aim of this trial is to determine preliminary activity of the combination treatment with nivolumab and entinostat in children and adolescents with high risk refractory/relapsed/progressive tumors harboring a high mutational load, focal MYC(N) amplification or ATRT-MYC subgroup as well as tumors with high tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) or a tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS).

DRUG: Nivolumab and Entinostat
Phase I: Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) of the combination treatment., A dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as any AE according to the definitions and exceptions listed below that is related to the administration of the combination of investigational agents occurring during the priming week and first cycle of combination treatment (first 5 weeks) in phase I of the trial.

A study participant will be considered evaluable for a DLT if at least 2 doses of nivolumab and 4 doses of entinostat were administered during the first 5 weeks (5 weeks normally incorporate the priming week and 1 cycle of planned combination treatment). Participants who discontinue treatment or have treatment delays preventing them from receiving the above defined minimal amount of treatment in the first cycle of combination treatment for reasons unrelated to study drug toxicity, are not evaluable for DLT and will be replaced in enrollment (maximum number of replacement subjects will be 3 per dose level)., 5 weeks|Phase II: Best response (CR or PR), Best response (CR or PR) will be based on RANO criteria for all primary CNS tumors and RECIST for non-CNS tumors, defined for each patient as the best response under study combination therapy during the first 6 cycles (assessment every 2 cycles).

Compared to adult cancers, most pediatric cancers carry a relatively low mutational burden. HDAC inhibition (HDACi) modifies T-cell regulation and can augment response to checkpoint inhibition by reducing the number of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and creating an immunogenic tumor microenvironment including induction of MHCI and neo-antigens. In vitro and in vivo models showed enhanced anti-tumor activity of the combination of checkpoint inhibition and HDACi compared to either agent alone. This provides a strong rationale to combine these drug classes. Checkpoint inhibition results in activation of tumor-associated T cells. It is now becoming increasingly evident that patients with tumors with a high number of tumor infiltrating T cells at baseline show an increased response rate. Additionally, recent clinical data on immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) for melanoma patients detected tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) as indicators of an activated adaptive immune response. Their presence has been linked to objective treatment responses in patients with different cancer entities receiving ICI.

Furthermore, MYC- or NMYC-driven (referred to as MYC(N)) malignancies like very high-risk medulloblastomas or very high-risk neuroblastomas still have a dismal outcome. MYC is not only reported to upregulate PD-L1 and thereby a possible biomarker for checkpoint inhibition but also very compelling recent preclinical data strongly suggests that HDAC inhibitors are active against MYC amplified medulloblastoma in vitro and in vivo. In NMYC amplified neuroblastoma cell lines similar observations were made in vitro. In addition, it has been shown recently that the molecular MYC subgroup of atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors (ATRT) exhibit a strong T-cell infiltrate in contrast to the SHH-ATRT subtype and are considered immunological "hot" tumors. Taken together, our results suggest that MYC(N)-driven tumors depend on HDAC and we hypothesize that MYC(N) status can serve as a biomarker for response prediction to a combinatorial treatment of checkpoint inhibition and HDAC inhibition.

Pediatric patients aged 2-21 years with refractory/relapsed/progressive high-risk malignancies with a high mutational load (group A), with MYC(N) amplification or from the ATRT-MYC subgroup (group C) as well as patients with high TILs and/or TLS positive (group E) are eligible for this trial. Phase I determines the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for the combination of the HDACi entinostat and the checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab for the age groups 6-11 and 12-21 years, respectively. Phase II investigates activity in 3 groups A, C, E for patients in the two age cohorts 2-11 and 12-21 years. The duration of treatment is 12 cycles (1 cycle = 28 days), preceded by 1 priming week.

In addition, a comprehensive accompanying research program investigates PD biomarkers for immune checkpoint and HDAC inhibition.

Clinical trials investigating the combination of nivolumab and entinostat in children have not been reported so far.
