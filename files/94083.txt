Role of microRNA in the Development of Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma
The aim of this study is to analyze the differential expression of the miR transcriptome in the distinctive stages of the development of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (C-SCC). In this aim the investigators plan to recruit a cohort of 20 patients suffering of C-SCC and to collect from each of them, biopsies corresponding to i) non UV-exposed areas ii) UV-exposed areas, iii) actinic keratosis and iv) tumoral regions. Total RNAs will be prepared from each biopsy and the miRNA profiles will be characterized using a dedicated miR array.

miRNAs, We will select the miRNAs differently expressed between biopsies obtained respectively from areas of normal, pretumoral and tumoral areas (candidate miRs = miRs potentially involved in tumor transformation of epidermal keratinocytes). This will be assessed by analyzing in each of the biopsies from each patient, the expression of different miRs that are known to date, using a dedicated microarray, then by checking the data obtained by quantitative PCR., 1 year
