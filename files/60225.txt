Application of a Novel Biomarker Based on Plasma cfDNA Assay in the Early Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer
The goal of this diagnostic test is to obtain multiple cell-free DNA （cfDNA） fragment profiles of subjects by whole genome sequencing based on plasma cfDNA, build a prostate cancer prediction model by machine learning, and to validate the efficacy of this model in patients who need to undergo needle prostate biopsy base on their prostate-specific antigen（PSA） or clinical or imaging evidence. Therefore, this study aims to explore the efficacy of this prostate cancer prediction model in distinguishing between patients with PSA "gray zone" (4-10 ng/ml) in the diagnosis of prostate cancer and patients with clinically significant prostate cancer.
