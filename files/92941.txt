Safety and Anti-Disease Activity of Oral Tosedostat (CHR-2797) in Elderly Subjects With Refractory or Relapsed AML
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tosedostat in elderly patients suffering from refractory or relapsed AML.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia|AML
DRUG: Tosedostat
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of tosedostat in elderly subjects with treatment refractory or relapsed AML by measuring CR and CRp., Months 1, 2, 3 & 6
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of tosedostat in elderly subjects with treatment refractory or relapsed AML, Screening, Days 1, 2, 8, 15, 29, monthly thereafter + unschedulded visits when deemed necessary|To evaluate the efficacy of tosedostat in elderly subjects with treatment refractory or relapsed AML, as determined by measures other than CR and CRp for the type and duration of response, Months 1, 2, 3 & 6
There is an urgent need for novel compounds and treatment strategies for elderly patients with AML, particularly those with refractory or relapsed disease for whom there are few effective treatment options. Treatment options for elderly patients are further limited by co-morbidity and tolerability constraints.

Tosedostat is a new aminopeptidase inhibitor, which in preclinical experiments has shown potent activity in both in vitro and in vivo cancer models as a single agent. In early clinical studies particularly good results have been observed in refractory and relapsed AML in older patients and these observations form the basis for the current study.

This multi-center, open label phase II study will enrol approximately 70 subjects in Part A and 130 subjects in Part B.
