Regorafenib and Yttrium-90 Radioembolization for Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to determine the effects that Regorafenib in combination with Yttrium-90 (Y-90) radioembolization has on patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.
Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma|Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: Regorafenib|RADIATION: TheraSphereâ„¢ Yttrium-90 Trans-Arterial Radioembolization
Disease Control Rate (DCR) Measured by Number of Participants, Disease Control Rate (DCR) is defined as the number of participants experiencing a best response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) after receiving protocol therapy. Response will be assessed using modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST) criteria for hepatocellular carcinoma., Up to 24 months|Number of Participants Experiencing Treatment Related Adverse Events, The number of participants experiencing treatment-related adverse events (AEs) in participants receiving protocol therapy will be assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) Version 5, per physician discretion., Up to 25 months|Number of Participants Experiencing Treatment Related Serious Adverse Events, The number of participants experiencing treatment-related serious adverse events (SAEs) in participants receiving protocol therapy will be assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) Version 5, per physician discretion., Up to 25 months
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective response rate (ORR) is the proportion of patients achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as the best response. Response will be assessed using modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST) criteria for hepatocellular carcinoma., Up to 36 months|Time to Tumor Progression, Time-to-tumor progression is defined as the period of time in months from start date of study treatment until documented date of confirmed disease progression. For participants without progression, follow-up time will be censored at the date of last disease assessment (as per mRECIST)., Up to 36 months|Duration of Overall Response (DOR), The duration of overall response (DOR) is measured in months from the time measurement criteria are met for complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per mRECIST criteria, until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is documented. For participants without progression, follow-up time will be censored at the date of last disease assessment, per mRECIST criteria., Up to 36 months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the elapsed time in months from the first date of study treatment until documented disease progression, per mRECIST criteria or death from any cause, whichever is earlier. For participants who remain alive without progression, follow-up time will be censored at the date of last disease assessment, per mRECIST criteria., Up to 36 months|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the elapsed time in months from date of first study treatment until death from any cause. Participants without documented death will be censored at the last date known to be alive., Up to 36 months
