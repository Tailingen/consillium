UV1 Vaccination Plus Nivolumab and Ipilimumab in Treatment of Melanoma
This is a randomized, open label study to investigate efficacy and safety of UV1 vaccination in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab as first line treatment of adult patients with histologically confirmed unresectable metastatic melanoma.

PFS Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 (by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), Compare progression free survival (PFS) of UV1 vaccination in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab to that of nivolumab and ipilimumab, Time from randomization to progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause (approximately 44 months)
Overall Survival, Compare Overall Survival of UV1 vaccination in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab to that of nivolumab and ipilimumab ., Time from randomization to death from any cause /follow-up until 70 PFS events/18 months post rand, approximately 44 months.|ORR Per RECIST 1.1, Compare the objective response rate (ORR) of UV1 vaccination in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab to that of nivolumab and ipilimumab., Number of complete and partial responses during the study, approximately 44 months.|DOR Per RECIST 1.1, Compare duration of response (DOR) of UV1 vaccination in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab to that of nivolumab and ipilimumab., Time from first CR or PR to PD or death from any cause, approximately 44 months.|Evaluation of Adverse Events, Vital Signs, Laboratory Assessments and ECOG Performance Status, Compare the safety of UV1 vaccination in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab to that of nivolumab and ipilimumab. Safety will be listed and summarized descriptively by treatment arm comparing number of participants with observation and changes from baseline and at each visit related to AEs, deaths, vital signs (weight (kg), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mmHg), pulse rate (bpm), body temperature (Â°C)), laboratory assessments and ECOG performance status (Grade 0 - Grade 5)., Time from randomization to end of study, approximately 47 months.
Immunological Mechanisms, To elucidate the immunological mechanisms underlying the interplay between immune activation provoked by UV1 vaccination and inhibition of tumor resistance mechanisms and peripheral immune tolerance induced by checkpoint blockade and how biological factors affect the efficacy of the combination therapy. This will be evaluated by change in immune- and tumor-related gene, cell, and protein profiles in blood over time in both treatment arms (analysis of plasma proteins, cell-free plasma DNA, and cellular genomic DNA)., Time from randomization to end of study to readout of primary objectives, approximately 44 months.
This is a randomized, open label study to investigate efficacy and safety of UV1 vaccination in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab as first line treatment of adult patients with histologically confirmed unresectable metastatic melanoma.

Patients in the experimental arm will receive 8 UV1 vaccinations over 4 cycles of nivolumab and ipilimumab. Patients in the control arm will receive 4 cycles of nivolumab and ipilimumab. Patients in both arms will start maintenance therapy 6 weeks after the last dose of induction therapy, nivolumab at a dose of 480 mg every 4 weeks.

All patients will be followed up until death or until the end of the study.

To support the Extended Exploratory Cohort of the study, an additional 20 patients at selected sites will be enrolled in a single arm UV1 cohort for collection of additional biological material. These patients are in addition to the 156 randomized patients in the main part of the study and will not be included in the main analysis of the study.
