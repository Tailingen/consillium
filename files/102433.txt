AMG386 Comb w. Either Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin or Topotecan Subjects w. Advanced Recurrent Epithelial Ovarian CR
This study is a 2 part, 2 cohort, open-label, dose escalation/de escalation study of AMG 386 in combination with either pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or topotecan in subjects with recurrent ovarian cancer. Up to 100 subjects will be enrolled to receive AMG 386 in combination with either pegylated liposomal doxorubicin every 4 weeks (cohort A) or topotecan weekly on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28 day dosing schedule (cohort B). Subject enrollment and assignment to either cohort will be based on eligibility and the investigator's discretion.

It is hypothesized that AMG 386, in combination with each of the chemotherapy regimens: either pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or topotecan will be safe and well tolerated in subjects with recurrent ovarian cancer.

DRUG: A1: AMG 386 10 mg/kg + Liposomal doxorubicin|DRUG: A3: AMG 386 15mg/kg + Liposomal doxorubicin|DRUG: B1: AMG 386 10 mg/kg + Topotecan|DRUG: B3: AMG 386 15mg/kg + Topotecan
The primary objective is to identify the incidence of adverse events and clinical laboratory abnormalities defined as dose limiting toxicity in subjects treated with AMG 386 + pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (cohort A) and with AMG 386 + topotecan, first 4 weeks of treatment
To evaluate the treatment effect as measured by: objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), PFS, change in tumor burden, CA 125 Response and Progression by GCIG and CA-125 duration of response, Treatment and follow-up phase of study|To evaluate the incidence of adverse events and clinical laboratory abnormalities not defined as DLTs., first 4 weeks of treatment|To determine the pharmacokinetics of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (and its metabolite, doxorubicinol), topotecan and AMG 386 (Cmax, AUC, and Cmin for intensive assessment; Cmax and Cmin for sparse assessment)., Treatment and follow-up phase of study|To estimate the incidence of anti AMG 386 antibody formation., Treatment and follow-up phase of study
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of AMG 386 when used with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or topotecan in subjects with advanced recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer
