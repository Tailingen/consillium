Topotecan in Treating Patients With Recurrent, Progressive, or Refractory Cancer That is Metastatic to the Lining Around the Brain
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of intrathecal or intraventricular topotecan in treating recurrent, progressive, or refractory cancer that is metastatic to the lining around the brain.
Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors
DRUG: topotecan hydrochloride
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the maximum tolerated dose of intrathecal or intraventricular topotecan in patients with recurrent, progressive, or refractory leptomeningeal disease.
* Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.
* Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.
* Determine the anti-tumor activity of this regimen in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are stratified according to disease (leukemia or lymphoma vs solid tumor or other malignancy).

Patients receive topotecan intrathecally or intraventricularly continuously on days 1-7. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 7 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of topotecan until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose- limiting toxicity.

Patients are followed for 6 months.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 50 patients (25 per stratum) will be accrued for this study.
