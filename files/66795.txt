Study of Olaparib (Lynparzaâ„¢) Versus Enzalutamide or Abiraterone Acetate in Men With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (PROfound Study)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of olaparib versus enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate in subjects with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who have failed prior treatment with a new hormonal agent and have homologous recombination repair gene mutations.
Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer
DRUG: olaparib|DRUG: enzalutamide|DRUG: abiraterone acetate|DRUG: abiraterone acetate|DRUG: enzalutamide
Radiological Progression Free Survival (rPFS) by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) - Cohort A Only, The time from randomisation until the date of objective radiological disease progression (determined by RECIST 1.1 (soft tissue) and Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG-3) (bone)) or death (by any cause in the absence of progression) regardless of whether the patient withdrew from randomised therapy or received another anti-cancer therapy prior to progression. Progression is defined using (i) Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for soft tissue, as a \>=20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions and an absolute increase of \>=5mm taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters since treatment started including the baseline sum of diameters; (ii) Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PGWG-3) for bone as \>= 2 new bone lesions on the 1st week 8 scan compared to baseline. The confirmatory scan, \>=6 weeks later, must show \>=2 more new bone lesions (for a total of \>=4 new bone lesions since baseline)., Tumor assessments every 8 weeks from randomisation until radiographic progression assessed by BICR (median duration of treatment of 7 and 4 months for Olaparib and Investigators Choice of NHA respectively).
Confirmed Objective Response Rate (ORR) by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) - Cohort A Only, ORR is the percentage of patients with at least one visit response of Complete response (CR) or Partial response (PR), in their soft tissue disease assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), in the absence of progression on bone scan assessed by Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3)). Per RECIST v1.1, CR=Disappearance of all target lesions; PR = \>=30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions; For each treatment group, ORR is the number of patients with a CR and PR., Tumor assessments every 8 weeks from randomisation until radiographic progression assessed by BICR (median duration of treatment of 7 and 4 months for Olaparib and Investigators Choice of NHA respectively).|Radiological Progression Free Survival (rPFS) by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) - Cohort A+B, The time from randomisation until the date of objective radiological disease progression (by RECIST 1.1 and Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PGWG-3)) or death (by any cause in the absence of progression) regardless of whether the patient withdrew from randomised therapy or received another anti-cancer therapy prior to progression., Tumor assessments every 8 weeks from randomisation until radiographic progression assessed by BICR (median duration of treatment of 7 and 4 months for Olaparib and Investigators Choice of NHA respectively).|Time to Pain Progression - Cohort A Only, Time from randomisation to time point at which worsening in pain is observed (ie date of pain progression - date of randomisation + 1). Based on average Brief Pain Inventory - short form (BPI-SF) worst pain \[Item 3\] and Analgesic Quantification Algorithm \[AQA\] score., Every 4 weeks from randomisation (for 7 consecutive days) throughout the study (median duration of treatment of 7 and 4 months for Olaparib and Investigators Choice of NHA respectively).|Overall Survival (OS) - Cohort A Only, Number of Participants with Overall Survival (OS) - Cohort A only., Approximately 35 months after the first patient was randomised.
This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of olaparib versus enzalutamide or abiraterone in subjects with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have failed prior treatment with a new hormonal agent (NHA) and have a qualifying tumor mutation in one of 15 genes involved in the homologous recombination repair (HRR) pathway. Subjects will be divided into two cohorts based on HRR gene mutation status.

Approximately 340 subjects will be randomized 2:1 (olaparib : investigator choice of enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate) into the trial.
