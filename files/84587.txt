Twenty-eight patients with HER2-positive gastric cancer with brain metastasis were divided into two cohortsï¼š Cohort A: Patients with brain metastases who have not previously received central nervous system radiotherapy, distance from the last systemic treatment junction The beam should be longer than 2 weeks. Cohort B: Patients with disease progression or new lesions after whole brain radiotherapy or stereotactic radiotherapy; For accepted offices For partially treated lesions, there is clear evidence of progress in imaging examination, and the lesions that have received radiotherapy can be selected as target diseases The kitchen range.
