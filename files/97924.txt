Melanoma Margins Trial-II: 1cm v 2cm Wide Surgical Excision Margins for AJCC Stage II Primary Cutaneous Melanoma
Patients with a primary invasive melanoma are recommended to undergo excision of the primary lesion with a wide margin. There is evidence that less radical margins of excision may be just as safe. This is a randomised controlled trial of 1 cm versus 2 cm margin of excision of the primary lesion for adult patients with stage II primary invasive cutaneous melanomas (AJCC 8th edition) to determine differences in disease-free survival. A reduction in margins is expected to improve patient quality of life.
Cutaneous Melanoma, Stage II
PROCEDURE: Wide Local Excision = 1cm Margin|PROCEDURE: Wide Local Excision = 2cm Margin
Disease-Free Survival, Time from randomisation until the first clinically, histologically or radiologically confirmed recurrence of melanoma at any body site, or death from any cause., 0-60 months
Local Recurrence, Time from randomisation to any clinically, histologically or radiologically confirmed LR of melanoma including satellite lesions and in transit metastases between the primary site and the regional draining lymph nodes or death from any cause., Day 0-Trial Completion (max. 120 months)|Distant Disease-Free Survival, Time from randomisation to any clinically, histologically or radiologically confirmed distant recurrence of melanoma or death from any cause, Day 0-Trial Completion (max. 120 months)|Melanoma-Specific Survival, Time from randomisation to death due to melanoma, Day 0-Trial Completion (max. 120 months)|Overall Survival, Time from randomisation to death from any cause, Day 0-Trial Completion (max. 120 months)|Melanoma-specific Quality of Life: FACT-M questionnaire, Measured by FACT-M (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Melanoma) questionnaire - It consists of two subsections: The FACT-G subsection is a 27-item compilation of general questions divided into four primary QOL domains: Physical Well-Being, Social/Family Well-Being, Emotional Well-Being, and Functional Well-Being. It is considered appropriate for use with patients with any form of cancer. The Melanoma Surgery Subscale evaluates melanoma-specific symptoms such as surgical morbidity and side effects., Baseline, 3, 6, 12 & 24 months|Neuropathic Pain: PainDetect questionnaire, Measured by PainDetect questionnaire, Baseline, 3, 6, 12 & 24 months|Health-related Quality of Life: EQ-5D-5L questionnaire, Measured by EuroQoL EQ-5D-5L questionnaire - This tool contains 5 domains including mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression., Baseline, 3, 6, 12 & 24 months|Surgery Related Adverse Events, The following surgical-related adverse events will be recorded from the time of surgery to 12-months following surgery (inclusive):

* wound dehiscence
* seroma/haematoma
* haemorrhage
* infection
* skin graft failure
* necrosis of flap used for reconstruction
* deep venous thrombosis
* urinary tract infection
* pneumonia
* cardiac complications
* lymphoedema, Up to 12-months from the date of surgery|Health Economic Evaluation, Data collected for economic analysis will be from hospital notes, MBS and PBS data (Australia) and patient reported outcome measures (including an employment questionnaire) at baseline, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months and at melanoma recurrence., Baseline, 3, 6, 12 & 24 months|Serious Adverse Events, All Serious Adverse events (SAEs), will be recorded from randomisation until 12 months post the surgical intervention or until the patient withdraws or dies., from randomisation up to 12-months post-surgery
This study will determine whether there is a difference in disease-free survival rates for patients with primary cutaneous melanoma with Breslow thickness \> 2mm or 1-2mm with ulceration (pT2b-pT4b, AJCC 8th edition), treated with either a 1cm excision margin or 2cm margin. The study is designed to be able to prove or disprove that there is no difference in risk of the tumour recurring around the scar or anywhere else in the body between the two groups of patients. If the study shows no risk of tumour recurrence then we will also be able to determine how much of an impact the narrower excision has on patients in terms of improved quality of life and reduced side effects from the surgery and melanoma disease. This trial will also evaluate and determine the economic impact of narrower excision margins on the health services and society in general.
