Establishment and Clinical Application of Precise SLNB System in Breast Cancer: a Randomized, Multicenter, Controlled Study
The investigatorsconduct the precise sentinel lymph node biopsy using preoperative computed tomographic lymphography in breast cancer. The investigators aimed to summarize the law of lymphatic drainage of breast, and to conduct the accurate surgical treatment of breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: Participants receive SLNB as well as non SLNs resection
Disease free survival, Time from randomization to recurrence, metastasis, appearance of a second primary tumor, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 10 years., Up to 10 years
Overall survival, Time from randomization to death from any cause, assessed up to 10 years., Up to 10 years
AIM:Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is the standard technique for patients with early stage breast cancer. The investigators conduct the precise sentinel lymph node biopsy using preoperative computed tomographic lymphography in breast cancer. And The investigators identify the true sentinel lymph nodes(SLNs) followed by lymphatic ducts during operation. The investigators aimed to identify the non-sentinel lymph node, and to investigate the relationship between upper extremity lymphatic drainage. The SLNB procedure could avoid unnecessary lymph node resection and reduce treatment-related sequela.
