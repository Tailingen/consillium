3D Port-A Catheter Model for New Staff
The aim of this study is to develop a highly realistic 3D-printed Port-A catheter upper body model to enhance the effectiveness of training new nursing staff in Port-A catheter placement and care skills.

Background： Cancer patients often require long-term administration of chemotherapy drugs, nutritional supplementation, and blood transfusions. During these treatments, an implantable central venous access (port-a catheter) is often utilized to avoid the inconvenience of repeated needle insertions for treatment and to minimize the risk of medication leakage. Port-A catheters are considered a safer clinical measure. However, poor care and maintenance of the catheter can lead to complications such as infection, catheter damage, and leakage, which can even result in death. Proper care and maintenance are crucial for the successful use of Port-A catheters. For nursing staff, acquiring professional knowledge in Port-A catheter care is essential for improving the quality of cancer patient care. Insufficient education and training in Port-A catheter care can lead to clinical errors that endanger patients' lives.

Methods： This study involves providing training to participants and assessing their performance and effectiveness. It employs a prospective quasi-experimental design with a single group and pre- and post-test evaluations. The study includes 50 newly recruited nursing staff.

Effect： The investigators anticipate that the use of a 3D-printed upper body Port-A catheter model will yield better results in the training of newly recruited nursing staff.
