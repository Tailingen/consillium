Study of Oral AEE788 in Adults With Advanced Cancer
AEE788 is an orally active, reversible, small-molecule, multi-targeted kinase inhibitor with potent inhibitory activity against ErbB and VEGF receptor family of tyrosine kinases. It has an IC50 of less than 100 nM against p-EGFR, p-ErbB2, and p-KDR (VEGFR2). This study will assess the safety, pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles and clinical activity of AEE788 in advanced cancers.
