A Study of Modakafusp Alfa in Adult Participants With Multiple Myeloma
The main aims of this study are to test for any side effects from modakafusp alfa in combination therapy and to determine the recommended dose of combination therapy with modakafusp. The dose of modakafusp alfa will be increased a little at a time until the highest dose that does not cause harmful side effects is found. Participants will be given modakafusp alfa through a vein.

The drug being tested in this study is called modakafusp alfa (TAK-573). The study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and determine the recommended dose of modakafusp alfa in combination with lenalidomide in participants with multiple myeloma (MM), or in combination with pomalidomide, bortezomib, carfilzomib, or daratumumab in participants with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM).

The study consists of 3 Groups: Group 1: MM Maintenance Therapy, Group 2: RRMM Doublets, Group 3: RRMM Triplets.

The study will enroll approximately 18 participants in Group 1, 66 in Group 2, and 36 in Group 3. Participants will be assigned to one of the following treatment groups as given below:

* Group 1 (MM Maintenance) Arm 1: Modakafusp alfa + Lenalidomide
* Group 2 (RRMM Doublets) Arm 2: Modakafusp alfa + Pomalidomide
* Group 2 (RRMM Doublets) Arm 3: Modakafusp alfa + Bortezomib
* Group 2 (RRMM Doublets) Arm 4: Modakafusp alfa + Carfilzomib
* Group 3 RRMM Triplets) Arm A: Modakafusp alfa + Pomalidomide + Bortezomib
* Group 3 (RRMM Triplets) Arm D: Modakafusp alfa + Daratumumab + Pomalidomide

Group 2 Arm 4 is closed for enrollment.

The study will be conducted worldwide. The maximum treatment duration in this study for Group 1 is until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or up to 2 years for minimal/measurable residual disease (MRD) negative \[-\] participants, whichever occurs first. The maximum treatment duration in this study for Group 2 and Group 3 is until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or until any other discontinuation criterion is met, whichever occurs first. Overall time to participate in the study is approximately up to 5 years.
