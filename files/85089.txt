SBRT for Oligometastatic Lymph Node Recurrence in Prostate Cancer: a Single Institution Experience
Single-institution retrospective analysis for predictive factors of prostate cancer patients presenting with isolated or limited lymph node (LN) recurrence (1-3 lesions) on F-Ccholine PET-CT (CholPET) treated with SBRT between January 2010 and July 2015.

time to biochemical recurrence, time interval from SBRT until second PSA rise, 18 months
biochemical response rate, reduction by at least 10% of the initial PSA value, 18 months|time interval between SBRT and ADT start, time interval between SBRT and ADT start, 18 months
Single-institution retrospective analysis of consecutive prostate cancer patients after definitive primary treatment, without local recurrence, presenting with isolated or limited lymph node (LN) recurrence (1-3 lesions) on F-Ccholine PET-CT (CholPET) treated with SBRT between January 2010 and July 2015.

Endpoints of interest are biochemical response rate (defined as a reduction by at least 10% of the initial PSA value), time to biochemical recurrence (TBR) (defined as the time interval from SBRT until second PSA rise), and time interval between SBRT and ADT start. Univariate analysis is used to identify prognostic factors.
