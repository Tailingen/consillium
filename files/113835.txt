Phase1/2 Study of IPH6501 in Patients With Relapsed /Refractory B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
This is an international, first-in-human, multicenter, open-label Phase 1/2 study to evaluate the safety profile, tolerability of IPH6501, and determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for patients with B-Cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
Non Hodgkin Lymphoma
DRUG: IPH6501
Safety and tolerability, To evaluate the safety profile (including dose limiting toxicities (DLT(s), the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or highest tested dose), tolerability and determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), From time of informed consent through treatment period and including the follow-up: up to 22 months
Objective Response Rate (ORR), To investigate any preliminary antitumor activity, From time of informed consent through treatment period and including the follow-up: up to 22 months|Duration Of Response (DoR), To investigate any preliminary antitumor activity, From time of informed consent through treatment period and including the follow-up: up to 22 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), To investigate any preliminary antitumor activity, From time of informed consent through treatment period and including the follow-up: up to 22 months|Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax), To characterize and evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of IPH6501, From time of informed consent through treatment period and including the follow-up: up to 22 months|Area Under the Plasma Concentration (AUC), To characterize and evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of IPH6501, From time of informed consent through treatment period and including the follow-up: up to 22 months|Incidence of antidrug antibodies (ADA) against IPH6501, To evaluate the immunogenicity of IPH6501, From time of informed consent through treatment period and including the follow-up: up to 22 months
In Phase 1 - Dose finding, patients with advanced histologically confirmed, documented CD20+ B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) will be enrolled. The dose finding part will include 2 sub-parts: Dose escalation will determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) or the highest tested dose, Dose assessment will determine RP2D.

In Phase 2 - Dose expansion, one or more cohorts will be selected with patients with subtypes of advanced histologically confirmed, documented CD20+ B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
