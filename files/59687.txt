Effect of G-CSF on MDSC and Cancer Stem-cells Interactions in Non-small Cell Lung Cancers (CIRCUIT)
Immunotherapy have revolutionized the field of oncology, but response rates are low and all patients relapse, due to immunologic (myeloid immunosuppressive cells) and non-immunologic (cancer stem- cells (CSC)) mechanisms. CSC are able to circulate within blood, protected from destruction by immunosuppressive cells such as MDSC. Some factors such as G-CSF, administered to lower febrile neutropenia, should modulate properties of MDSC and CSC, but data are contradictory, and literature remain poor regarding its effects on the interactions between MDSC and CSC in blood clusters. Indeed, this project aims at better characterizing the effect of G-CSF on these interactions and on their functions in NSCLC patients receiving G-CSF.

Phenotype of MDSC and CSC, Expression of different MDSC markers corresponding to the rate of the different MDSC subpopulations, At baseline, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months (end of chemo-immunotherapy) or in case of relapse|Functions of MDSC and CSC, Immunosuppressive and non immunosuppressive functions of the different populations of MDSC, At baseline, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months (end of chemo-immunotherapy) or in case of relapse
MDSC, CSC and the clusters in blood from NSCLC patients will be assessed to evaluate the impact of G-CSF on their phenotype and functions. Samples from 2 groups of NSCLC patients receiving chemotherapy and immunotherapy will be used: 15 receiving concomitant G-CSF, and 15 not receiving concomitant G-CSF
