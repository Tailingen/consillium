Plasma Biomarkers C-RAC, ICORG 12-27, V1
This is an exploratory, translational, non-interventional and multi-centre clinical study.
Colorectal Cancer
Disease free survival or progression free survival, Identify plasma biomarkers with improved sensitivity to predict early recurrence of CRAC and presence of residual occult metastases following completion of adjuvant chemotherapy, Duration of treatment and follow up, expected to be 4 years
Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and concordance index, To validate a panel of predictive and/or prognostic plasma biomarkers, proving its accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and concordance index., Duration of treatment and follow up period, expected to be 4 years|To investigate the correlation between biomarkers identified in plasma samples with the expression of the same biomarkers at tissue level., This allows for further understanding of the role of cancer-related and/or host-related proteins in disease response and progression, For the duration of treatment and follow up, expected to be 4 years
Cohort A will consist of 100 CRAC patients with stage II/III resectable disease due for adjuvant chemotherapy.

Cohort B will consist of 30 patients with stage II resectable disease for observation only.

Both cohorts will have a follow up period of up to 2 years, post chemotherapy for cohort A and post resection for cohort B.
