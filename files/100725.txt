Role of Uterine Manipulator in Hysterectomy - Ro.Man.HY
Prospective multicentric randomized trial to evaluate the role of uterine manipulator on laparoscopic/robotic total hysterectomy for the treatment of early stage G1 - G2 endometrial cancer (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics - FIGO stages IA-IB).
Endometrial Cancer
DEVICE: Clermont-Ferrand Uterine Manipulator|OTHER: No uterine Manipulator
Upstaging rate, Evaluation of Lymphovascular space invasion and pre- / post-Hysterectomy pelvic cytology in order to investigate if the use of uterine manipulator has a role in upstaging of early-stage endometrial cancer, 30 days
Complications, To measure intra- and postoperative complication rate in order to investigate the specific role of uterine manipulator in complication occurred during hysterectomy or within 30 days after., within 30 days from surgery|Blood Loss, To measure intraoperative estimated blood loss (EBL) in order to investigate the specific role of uterine manipulator in hemostatic control during Hysterectomy safety of laparoscopic hysterectomy, Intraoperative|Impact of surgical procedure, To measure the specific role of uterine manipulator in impact on surgery. More in dept operative time (OT), ileus, discharge time will be respectively measured in minutes, hours and days., Perioperative|Role of uterine manipulator in Obesity, To determine the specific correlations between the use or not of uterine manipulator and Body Mass Index (BMI measured in kg/m2). To investigate if even this issue could influence the intraoperative safety, Intraoperative|Impact on postoperative pain, To investigate if the use or not of uterine manipulator could have a role in postoperative pain. Visual Analog Score (VAS) will be used to evaluate it., Postoperative|Oncological Outcomes: Rate of local relapses, To investigate if the use or not of uterine manipulator could determine an higher rate of local relapses, 1 years - 5 years
This multicentric prospective randomized Phase III trial is aimed to verify if the use of uterine manipulator for laparoscopic/robotic treatment of early stage endometrial cancer can influence the impact of peritoneal cytology and lymph vascular space invasion (LVSI) and the outcomes in terms of perioperative and oncological (disease free survival - DFS, overall survival - OS) outcomes.
