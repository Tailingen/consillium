Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin is currently the only German University Hospital with an available capacitive radiofrequency electromagnetic field treatment device. While there is retrospective data available regarding the assumed effectiveness and low toxicity profile of radiofrequency electromagnetic field treatment for glioblastoma in the palliative setting, there is only few prospective data available on the combined effect first-line chemoradiation and radiofrequency electromagnetic field treatment. The investigators aim to conduct a feasibility trial and plan to compare the results with data of a prospective trial with a comparable patient population.
