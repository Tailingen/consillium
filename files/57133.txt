A Study of MM-121 With Paclitaxel in Platinum Resistant/ Refractory Advanced Ovarian Cancers
To determine whether the combination of MM-121 plus paclitaxel is more effective than paclitaxel alone
Epithelial Ovarian Cancer|Fallopian Tube Cancer|Peritoneal Cancer
DRUG: MM-121|DRUG: Paclitaxel
Progression Free Survival, To determine whether MM-121 + paclitaxel was more effective than paclitaxel alone in prolonging progression-free survival in advanced ovarian cancers resistant or refractory to platinum agents. PFS was a time to event measure, and progression of disease is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), "as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions". Progression free survival was defined as the number of months from the date of randomization to the date of death or progression. If neither death nor progression was observed during the study, PFS data was censored at the last non-progressive disease valid tumor assessment unless the patient was discontinued due to symptomatic deterioration. If this occurred, the patient was counted as having progressive disease (PD)., Time from first dose to date of progression, the longest time frame of 3.9 years
Overall Survival, To determine whether MM-121 + paclitaxel is more effective than paclitaxel alone in prolonging overall survival. This was a time-to-event analysis of time from first dose to date of death., Time from first dose to date of death, with a median of approximately 13 months
This is a multicenter, open-label, randomized, Phase II study of MM-121 in patients with platinum resistant or refractory recurrent/advanced ovarian cancers. Up to 210 patients will be randomized (2:1) to receive MM-121 plus paclitaxel or paclitaxel alone.
