Adoptive Transfer of Specific HCC Antigens CD8+ T Cells for Treating Patients With Relapsed/Advanced HCC
This study enrolls patients who have relapsed/advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, BCLC stage C). The HCC tumor relapsed or metastasized through the body after standard treatment or the patients cannot receive standard treatment under current conditions. This research study uses specific HCC antigens CD8+ T cells, a new experimental treatment.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerance as well as the potential clinical efficacy of an adoptive transfer of CD8+ T cells, sorted with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-peptide multimers and specific for Glypican (GPC)-3 /New York Esophageal Squamous-1 (NY-ESO-1) /alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) antigens and cultured in vitro, to patients suffering from relapsed/advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: HCC antigens-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes|DRUG: IL-2|DRUG: Tegafur
Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events [Safety], Defined as signs/symptoms, laboratory toxicities, and clinical events that are possibly, likely, or definitely related to study treatment Adverse events assessed according to NCI-CTCAE v4.0 criteria 2., 4 weeks
Biological activity of infused T cells, To assess the biological activity of infused in vitro expanded and sorted HCC antigens-specific T cells., 4 weeks
Progress Free Survival (PFS), PFS is the time that passes from the date that patient enrolled in the clinical trial and the date on which HCC progresses or the date on which the patient dies. HCC progression was evaluated by imaging according to the irRC standard., 12 weeks or up to death|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is the proportion of patients who had a response rate including complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR) and disease stabilization (SD) evaluated by imaging according to the irRC standard., 12 weeks or up to death
