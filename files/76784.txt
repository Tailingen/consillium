Observational Study of the Effectiveness of Funded Drugs for Genitourinary Tumors.
SOGUG-PRINCIS is a retrospective (regarding patient inclusion) and prospective follow-up, epidemiological, non-interventional, non-blinded, non-randomized, multicenter, national observational study with drugs. This study will collect data from patients with genitourinary tumors to analyze the effectiveness under routine clinical practice conditions of drugs recently approved for funding in the Spanish National Health System.

In all cases, the decision to start treatment will be made prior to and independently of participation in the study, which will be limited to subsequently collecting the data necessary to assess the objectives of the study.

This study will serve as a registry for genitourinary cancers. Every time a new drug will be authorized, a new subproject with a primary endpoint will be opened to recruitment. The substudy will try to validate with real-world data the endpoints reported in the phase III clinical trials that led to the marketin authorization.
