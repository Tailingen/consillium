A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Bevacizumab in Combination With Chemotherapy in Previously Treated Metastatic Breast Cancer (RIBBON 2)
This phase III, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, blinded trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab when combined with standard chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone in subjects with previously treated metastatic breast cancer.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Standard chemotherapy
Progression-free Survival, PFS was defined as the time from randomization to first documented disease progression (PD) as determined by the investigator using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. For target lesions, PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of the longest diameter recorded since treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions. For non-target lesions, PD was defined as the appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (those with the longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements by imaging techniques or clinically. All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions per organ and 10 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions., Baseline to data cut-off for analysis of the primary Outcome Measure (up to 3 years, 2 months)
Progression-free Survival Within Individual Standard Chemotherapy Cohorts (Taxanes, Gemcitabine, Capecitabine, and Vinorelbine), Progression-free survival was defined as the time from randomization to first documented disease progression as determined by the investigator using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Results are reported for each of the 4 standard chemotherapy cohorts used in the study., Baseline to data cut-off for analysis of the primary Outcome Measure (up to 3 years, 2 months)|Overall Survival, Overall survival was defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause., Baseline to the end of the study (up to 6 years, 7 months)|One-year Survival, Percentage of patients who survived 1 year in the study., Baseline to the end of the study (up to 6 years, 7 months)|Objective Response, A patient had an objective response if they had a complete response or a partial response determined on two consecutive occasions â‰¥ 4 weeks apart as determined by the investigator using RECIST. For target lesions, a complete response was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions; a partial response was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter. For non-target lesions, a complete response was defined as the disappearance of all non-target lesions; a partial response was defined as the persistence of 1 or more non-target lesions., Baseline to data cut-off for analysis of the primary Outcome Measure (up to 3 years, 2 months)|Duration of Objective Response, Duration of objective response was defined as the time from the initial response to documented disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. Duration of objective response was only analyzed in patients who achieved an objective response., Baseline to data cut-off for analysis of the primary Outcome Measure (up to 3 years, 2 months)
For all Outcome Measures except Overall Survival and One-year Survival, the Time Frame was from Baseline to data cut-off for analysis of the primary Outcome Measure (up to 3 years 2 months). For the Outcome Measures Overall Survival and One-year Survival, the Time Frame was from Baseline to the end of the study (up to 6 years, 7 months).
