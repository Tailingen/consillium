This study is an open-label, prospective phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of of combination of Apatinib and Fluzoparib with or without Adebrelimab in previously-treated TP53-mutant advanced non-small cell lung cancer. The study is divided into 2 cohorts. Cohort 1 is a two-drug cohort \[Apatinib 375 mg po qd; Fluzoparib 100mg po bid\], and cohort 2 is a three-drug cohort \[apatinib 375 mg po qd; fluzoparib 100mg po bid; Adebrelimab 1200mg, iv, d1, q3w\]. The sample sizes of these two cohorts were determined according to Simon's Two-Stage Design, and enrollment of cohort 2 will be initiated after the enrollment of cohort 1 is completed. Ultimately, 34 patients are enrolled in the cohort 1 and 26 in the cohort 2.
