ENABLE-1 (Engaging Toll-like Receptor Signalling for B-cell Lymphoma Chimeric Antigen Receptor Therapy)
This Phase 1, single centre, open label dose escalation study aims to identify a safe dose of third-generation anti-CD19 CAR T-cells (WZTL-002) in the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) B-cell Non Hodgkin Lymphoma, for use in further efficacy trials. An expansion cohort will assess automated closed-system manufacture of WZTL-002 and outpatient management of participants.

This is a Phase 1 study, designed to evaluate the safety, feasibility, efficacy and kinetics of third-generation autologous anti-CD19 CAR T-cells, WZTL-002, in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma without other curative options. The initial dose escalation cohort will use a 3+3 dose escalation design to identify a Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of WZTL-002 using pre-defined Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) criteria. Within a subsequent dose expansion cohort at the recommended phase 2 dose, an automated closed-system manufacturing process for WZTL-002 and outpatient clinical management will be implemented.

Eligible participants will undergo leukapheresis to harvest peripheral blood mononuclear cells, the starting material for the manufacture of the autologous third generation anti-CD19 CAR T-cell product, WZTL-002. After WZTL-002 manufacture and confirmation that product release criteria are met, participants will receive lymphodepleting chemotherapy comprising fludarabine and cyclophosphamide on days -5 to day -3, inclusive. WZTL-002 will be administered intravenously on day 0 as a single dose.

Following WZTL-002 administration, participants will be monitored closely for 14 days, including targeted assessments for the specific CAR T-cell related toxicities of Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) and Immune Effector Cell Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS). Initial DLT assessment will occur at day 21 after WZTL-002 infusion. A PET/CT Scan to assess treatment response will take place 3 months after WZTL-002 infusion, marking the end of the primary follow up period. The secondary follow up period will occur between 3 months up until 2 years after WZTL-002 treatment. Long term follow up within the trial will occur annually from 2 to 5 years after WZTL-002 treatment, with further follow-up within the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMT) Cellular Therapies Registry and the Australasian Bone Marrow Transplant Recipient Registry (ABMTRR). In addition to clinical data, this study incorporates sample collection for exploratory endpoints including serum cytokine profile following WZTL-002 infusion, and WZTL-002 expansion, persistence and phenotype.
