A database on 400 patients diagnosed with lymphomas was built up over 20 years at Nîmes University Hospital. Biopsies were made on these tumours and all the samples were frozen.

Considering the heterogeneous nature of lymphomas, randomized clinical trials based on very precise criteria for the inclusion or non-inclusion of patients are the gold standard for studying the various sub-types of lymphomas by concentrating on homogeneous populations for which a limited number of parameters are analyzed simultaneously. However, due to the complexity of their medical situation, many patients may be excluded form these trials, thus making it difficult to obtain reliable results.

The analysis of a non-selected cohort has two main advantages: (1) to better understand the diversity of patients with lymphomas for which the recommendations are constantly evolving and (2) to analyze how, exactly, these are managed by integrating points which are currently poorly evaluated such as comorbidities and accessibility to treatment.

The aim of the study is to describe how these patients are managed and to demonstrate that not all patients are able to benefit from the official management recommendations applicable to their pathology.
