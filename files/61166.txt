Perioperative Iron for Colorectal Cancer (PICoC Study)
The PICoC study aims to investigate whether oral ferric maltol given postoperatively offers an improvement in patient and clinician reported outcomes compared to standard care.

the feasibility of running the study, to see if it could be run as a large multi-centre study, Feasibility measures will include the number of patients:

whether the use of ferric maltol could improve the postoperative quality of life of patients after colorectal cancer surgery compared to standard care., Quality of life as determined by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)-An questionnaire scoring between 0 and 184 values. Higher scores mean a better or worse outcome on different parts of the questionnaire., 1 year|whether the use of ferric maltol could improve the postoperative quality of life of patients after colorectal cancer surgery compared to standard care., Quality of life as determined by the Short Form Health Survey questionnaire (SF-36) Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability., 1 year|whether the use of ferric maltol could improve the postoperative quality of life of patients after colorectal cancer surgery compared to standard care., Quality of life as determined by the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire which has 2 scales - the EQ-5D descriptive system (page 2 of the questionnaire) and the EQ-5D visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). Responses are coded as a number (1, 2, 3, 4 or 5) that corresponds to the respective level of severity: 1 indicates no problems, and 5 extreme problems. In this way, a person's health state profile can be defined by a 5-digit number, ranging from 11111 (having no problems in any of the dimensions) to 55555 (having extreme problems in all the dimensions)., 1 year|the change in postoperative haemoglobin in response to ferric maltol compared to standard care., change in postoperative haemoglobin in g/l, 1 year|the change in postoperative ferritin levels in response to ferric maltol compared to standard care., change in postoperative ferritin levels in ng/mL, 1 year|postoperative allogenic red blood cell transfusion rates, postoperative allogenic red blood cell transfusion rates in patients receiving ferric maltol or standard care, 1 year
Colorectal cancer is associated with iron deficiency anaemia in 40-60% of cases. This anaemia can lead to poorer post-operative outcomes such as higher complication rates, increased length of stay and reduced survival. There has been a recent shift towards the correction of preoperative anaemia in order to optimize perioperative outcomes. However, despite improvements in preoperative haemoglobin there exists a group of patients who develop worsening or recurrent anaemia in the post-operative period. Without intervention up to 90% of patients in the immediate postoperative period may develop anaemia. This is not unexpected given the peri-operative blood loss; poor nutritional intake in the postoperative period; and the frequent blood sampling for laboratory tests. Our data from previous trials has demonstrated that despite preoperative intravenous iron therapy 75% of patients remain anaemic at the time of their colorectal cancer operation. In addition, our unpublished data has found that around 1/3 of patients treated with preoperative iron therapy develop a recurrence of their anaemia in the first year postoperatively. Studies have identified that traditional oral ferrous iron supplementation is largely ineffective for the treatment of postoperative anaemia. However, a newer oral iron preparation - ferric maltol (Ferracru) has been found to be better tolerated and more efficacious than ferrous iron. This study aims to evaluate whether the use of iron supplementation in the form of Feraccru could lead to a more sustained or improved a response in haemoglobin if given after a colorectal cancer operation. Improving this postoperative anaemia may have important implications for clinician and patient reported outcomes. The Perioperative Iron in Colorectal Cancer (PICoC) trial will run as a feasibility study to assess the proposed design, recruitability and outcome measures. Anaemic colorectal cancer patients treated with preoperative intravenous iron will be randomised in an open label design to receive a course of Ferric maltol (intervention group) or standard care (control group) postoperatively. Secondary outcome measures will focus on a comparison of change in blood indices, quality of life, allogenic red blood transfusion rates and postoperative complications between groups. Follow up will continue until the first postoperative outpatient visit at approximately 12 weeks following discharge.
