Endoscopic Treatment of Rectal Neuroendocrine Tumor(NET) Less Than 10mm
Cap-assisted endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR-C) and endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) have both been reported to be effective treatment methods for small rectal neuroendocrine tumor (NET) in limited studies. Which one is better has not been determined. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of EMR-C and ESD for the treatment of small rectal NET.
