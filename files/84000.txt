Bendamustine Plus Rituximab Versus CHOP Plus Rituximab
The study addresses the question if the first line therapy of low malignant and mantle cell lymphomas with bendamustine plus rituximab is comparable (non inferior) with CHOP plus rituximab with regard to progression free survival (PFS).
Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas|Follicular Lymphomas|Immunocytomas|Lymphocytic Lymphomas|Marginal Zone Lymphomas
DRUG: Bendamustine|DRUG: Standard chemotherapy CHOP + Ritiximab
Progression free survival, observation 3 years or significant differences between two arms
Determination and comparison of remission rates, of toxicity, infectious complications, overall survival, EFS, TTNT, capacity of peripheral blood stem cell mobilization, ongoing
The 4 agent chemotherapy (CTX) CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine prednisone) in combination with the monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody rituximab (CHOP-R) represents a standard CTX for the treatment of lymphomas of high or low malignancy. The combination of bendamustine and rituximab (B-R) is also highly effective with a more advantageous toxicity profile. If B-R could be shown to be non inferior to CHOP-R, this could improve the quality of life of the patient and possibly also the prognosis.
