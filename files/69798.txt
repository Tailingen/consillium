Docetaxel With or Without Ascorbic Acid in Treating Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer
This randomized phase II trial studies how well docetaxel works when given with or without ascorbic acid in treating patients with prostate cancer that has spread to other places in the body. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is a water-soluble vitamin that may help inhibit the growth of cancer cells. It is not yet known whether docetaxel works better when given with or without ascorbic acid in treating prostate cancer.

DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Ascorbic Acid|DRUG: Docetaxel|OTHER: Laboratory Biomarker Analysis|OTHER: Pharmacological Study|OTHER: Placebo|OTHER: Quality-of-Life Assessment
Number of Participates With a Decline in Prostate-specific Antigen From Their Baseline Measurement, prostate-specific antigen decline will be defined as â‰¥ 50% from baseline measurement, up to 24 weeks|Number of Participants With Adverse Events, Number of participants experiencing fatigue, nausea, bone pain, and anorexia as defined by CTCAE 4.0, Up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug
Average Number of Times Docetaxel Had Dose Reductions, The number of dose reductions and total number of completed cycles will be summarized by study arm., Up to 24 weeks|Number of Serious Adverse Events, Number of serious adverse events of all types as defined by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 4.0.

A serious adverse event is an undesirable sign, symptom, or medical condition that:

* Results in death
* Is life threatening
* Requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of existing hospitalization for \>24 hours
* Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
* Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
* Is an important medical event, Up to 30 days after last dose of study drug|Number of Participates Experiencing Serious Adverse Events (SAE), Number of serious adverse events defined as grade 3 or higher (fatigue, nausea, bone pain, and anorexia) in participates as defined by CTCAE 4.0, Up to 24 weeks|Change in Quality of Life (QoL) as Measured by the FACT-P Questionnaire, The (FACT-P) is made up of 39 question, with the total score ranging between 0 and 156 with 0 being the best and 156 as the worst., Up to course 6 of therapy (18 weeks)|Radiographic Progression Free Survival (rPFS), To determine the rPFS of participates that receive at least one dose of ascorbic acid compared to those who received placebo, Up to 3 years
Effect of Ascorbic Acid on Docetaxel Exposure, To determine whether ascorbic acid alters docetaxel exposure and compare between treatment arms, pharmacokinetics samples will be collected prior to, during, and after ascorbic acid and docetaxel infusions., Up to 24 weeks|F2-isoprostanes, a Pharmacodynamic Measure of Oxidant Injury in Vivo, Correlative analyses will assess the association between ascorbic acid and lipid peroxidation (F2-isoprostanes) in the two study arms, globally, and over time. Comparisons of ascorbic acid and F2-isoprostanes by study arm at cycle 1, cycle 2, cycle 4 and cycle 6, accounting for baseline measures obtained from the same patient, will be made by taking differences between post baseline and baseline values and comparing these differences between arms of the study with t-tests. Regression will also be used to assess the association between F2-isoprostane and ascorbic acid at cycle 4 and at cycle 6., Up to course 6 (18 weeks)|Peak and Trough Ascorbic Acid Levels, Up to 24 weeks
