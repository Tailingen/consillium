Modernizing Instructions to Improve Treatment Participation of Subjects During Their First Radiotherapy
Daily patient participation is critical to the successful, life-saving delivery of radiotherapy. There is very little in the literature describing the best way to prepare patients to give optimal participation. This study aims to look at an already-prepared conversion of patient instruction materials and measure whether the improvement in clarity and specificity produces the desired changes in patient decision-making and emotional comfort.
