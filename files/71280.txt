Prospective Clinical Investigation Comparing Standard Wound Closure Technique With Drains (Control) to Standard Wound Closure Techniques With TissuGlu® and No Drains (Test) in Mastectomy
Comparing standard wound closure technique with drains (control) to standard wound closure techniques with TissuGlu® and no drains (test) in mastectomy
Cancer, Breast
DEVICE: Test - Standard Closure with TissuGlu Surgical Adhesive
Number of Post-Operative Clinical Interventions, Clinical Intervention is defined as one of the following events:

1. Removal of an in-dwelling drain (As defined in the Protocol);
2. Needle aspiration to remove fluid from a Clinically-Relevant Seroma (As defined in the Protocol);
3. Invasive action to the drain or drain wound such as repositioning or re-attaching the drain retention sutures;
4. Reinsertion or insertion of a drain post operatively;
5. Surgical procedures due to wound healing complications related to wound management, from day 0 to day 90

A prospective, randomized, controlled, multicenter non-inferiority study comparing standard wound closure technique with drains (control) to standard wound closure techniques with TissuGlu® and no drains (test) in mastectomy. Patients will be enrolled for 90 Days from day of Surgery. It is expected that it will take 6-9 months for the full duration of the study including the 90 day follow up period.
