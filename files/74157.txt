A Study of INCB099280 in Combination With Axitinib in Adults With Advanced Solid Tumors
This study is being conducted to evaluate the safety and tolerability of INCB099280 in combination with axitinib and to assess the antitumor activity of INCB099280 in combination with axitinib. This study will only be open in the UK and EU.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: INCB099280|DRUG: axitinib
Part 1: Number of participants with Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), Dose-limiting toxicity will be defined as the occurrence of any of the toxicities as per protocol., Up to 21 days|Part 1: Number of participants with Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Defined as adverse events reported for the first time or worsening of a pre-existing event after first dose of study drug., Up to 2 years and 90 days|Part 1: Number of participants with TEAEs leading to dose modification, Number of participants with TEAEs leading to a dose modification (treatment interruption, dose reduction, and permanent discontinuation of either study drug)., Up to 2 years|Part 2: Objective response rate (ORR), Defined as the percentage of participants with best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), as determined by investigator according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1., Up to 2 years
Part 2: Number of participants with Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Defined as adverse events reported for the first time or worsening of a pre-existing event after first dose of study drug., Up to 2 years and 90 days|Part 2: Number of participants with TEAEs leading to dose modification, Number of participants with TEAEs leading to a dose modification (treatment interruption, dose reduction, and permanent discontinuation of either study drug)., Up to 2 years|Part 1: Objective response rate (ORR), Defined as the percentage of participants with best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), as determined by investigator according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1., Up to 2 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Defined as the best overall response of CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) of at least 11 weeks from the start of treatment by investigator assessment per RECIST v1.1., Up to 2 years|Duration of Response (DOR), Defined as the time from the first CR or PR until disease progression by investigator assessment per RECIST v1.1 or death from any cause, whichever occurs earlier., Up to 2 years|INCB099280 and axitinib plasma concentrations., PK parameters will be calculated from the blood plasma concentrations of INCB099280 and axitinib using standard noncompartmental (model independent) PK methods., Up to 2 years
