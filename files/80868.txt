Gut Microbiota in Intestinal Barrier Damage in Acute Leukemia Patients Undergoing Inpatient Induction
This is an observational study to collect stool, blood, and urine from acute leukemia patients undergoing induction chemotherapy in order to generate preliminary data regarding the association between microbiota and chemotherapy-induced gut barrier damage. This study consists of inpatient collections of blood, urine, and stool while the patients are undergoing inpatient induction therapy. Patients will not be scheduled for any additional procedures or testing beyond what is required for clinical care.
