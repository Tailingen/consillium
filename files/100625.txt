Establishment of a national biorepository including biospecimen and clinical data collections for future use, The objective of this study to establish a biorepository of biospecimen and clinical data. There is no primary clinical outcome for this study., Up to 1 year
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

To establish a national biorepository including biospecimen and clinical data collections from patients treated with immuno-oncology (IO) therapeutics who experience one or more serious (grade 3-4) immune-related adverse events (irAEs), rare infections or hyperprogression (acceleration of tumor growth).

OUTLINE:

Patients undergo collection of tissue and blood samples (and optional stool samples from patients experiencing colitis) at the time of registration (within 72 hours of confirmation of one or more severe irAEs) and at 1 month after registration. Patients' medical records are also reviewed for up to 1 year.
