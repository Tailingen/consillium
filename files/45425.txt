A Study Evaluating the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Anti-tumor Activity of ABBV-321 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors Associated With Overexpression of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)
This is an open-label, Phase 1, dose-escalation study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase two dose (RPTD), and to assess the safety, preliminary efficacy, and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of ABBV-321 for participants with advanced solid tumors likely to overexpress the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The study will consist of 2 phases: Dose Escalation Phase and Expansion Phase.

Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the number of days from the first dose date to the earliest date of disease progression per RECIST 1.1 or RANO criteria or death, whichever occurred first., Up to approximately 5 years|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR for a given participant is defined as the number of days from the day CR or PR (whichever is recorded first) occurred to the earliest date of disease progression per RECIST 1.1 or RANO criteria or death, whichever occurred first., Up to approximately 5 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the proportion of participants with objective evidence of complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD); a participants best overall response assignment of SD must be maintained for at least 6 weeks since the first dose date of study drug., Up to 5 years|Time to progression (TTP), TTP is defined as the number of days from the first dose date to the earliest date of disease progression per RECIST version 1.1 or RANO criteria., Up to approximately 5 years|Change from Baseline in QTcF, QT interval measurement corrected by Fridericia's formula (QTcF) change from baseline, Up to 61 days post dose|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as number of days from the date of the first dose to the date of death for all dosed participants. For participants who are not deceased, the data will be censored at the last known date to be alive., Up to approximately 5 years|Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of participants with a response of partial response (PR) or better; Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria will be used for glioblastoma (GBM) participants, and Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria will be used for all other participants., Up to 5 years
