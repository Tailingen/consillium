Study of the Prognostic Role of Gene Polymorphism in the Development of B-cell Leukemias and Lymphomas in Children of Kazakh Nationality
To search for a genetic marker of B-cell leukemias and lymphomas in children of Kazakh nationality, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of DNA obtained from the peripheral blood of patients with B-cell leukemias and lymphomas in children of Kazakh nationality and normal control will be performed.
