Effect on QTc, Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and Preliminary Efficacy of Single-agent Palifosfamide-tris in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is an open-label study of palifosfamide-tris administered intravenously on Days 1, 2, and 3 of a 21-day cycle to subjects with advanced solid tumors. Enrolled subjects will receive a placebo-control infusion on Day -1 and then commence palifosfamide-tris study treatment 24 hours later on Day 1.

Time-matched, intensive ECG monitoring will occur during and following placebo and palifosfamide-tris infusions on Days -1, 1, 2, 3 and 8. Generation of ECG data for study analysis will be performed in a blinded fashion at a central ECG laboratory.

Blood and urine sampling to characterize the pharmacokinetics of palifosfamide-tris will be performed on Days 1 through 8 of Cycle 1.
