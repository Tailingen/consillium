A Novel Target Delineation Scheme in High-grade Glioma Patients: a Randomized Single-blind Clinical Trial
The main question it aims to answer are:

1. whether the new target delineation scheme can improve Progression-free Survival
2. whether it can reduce the incidence of radiation complications in high-grade glioma patients.

Participants in trial group will be performed radiotherapy of new target delineation method after the completion of the operation within 4-6 weeks., while participants in the control group be performed radiotherapy of EORTC(European organisation for research and treatment of cancer) target delineation method.Temozolomide 75 mg / ( m² · d ) will be given to both groups of patients during radiotherapy. After radiotherapy, its dose changes to 150 \~ 200 mg / ( m² · d ) for 5 days and stopped for 23 days as a cycle. There are 6 cycles in total.
Radiation Toxicity|MRI Simulated Positioning|High Grade Glioma|Progression-free Survival|Overall Survival
RADIATION: reduced target volume|RADIATION: EORTC (European organisation for research and treatment of cancer) target volume
progression-free survival, confirm if the participant's cancer progresses or he/she dies every time back to the hospital during screening and follow-up, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 3 years
overall survival, confirm if the participant dies every time back to the hospital during screening and follow-up, From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 3 year|European organisation for research and treatment of cancer QLQ-C30 (EORTC-QLQ-C30), EORTC-QLQ-C30 questionnaire, through study completion, up to 3 years|radiotherapy complication incidence, through study completion, up to 3 years
