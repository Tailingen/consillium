Circulating Tumor DNA As Liquid Biopsy in Patients with Stage IV Solid Tumors, a Feasibility Study At MUSC HCC
1. To demonstrate the ability to detect specific cancer mutations in ctDNA isolated from plasma of stage IV cancer patients at HCC.
2. To compare, in each patient, ctDNA longitudinal samples through treatment, and when available, with those of primary tumor and metastasis.
Solid Tumor, Adult
PROCEDURE: research blood draws
Detecting specific cancer mutations in ctDNA isolated from plasma of stage IV cancer patients at HCC., 24 months|Changes in patients' ctDNA longitudinal samples through treatment, and when available, of primary tumor and metastasis., 24 months
The overall goal of this study is to study circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the blood to determine how cancer cells in patients react to treatment. DNA is short for deoxyribonucleic acid. DNA contains information that determines in part the traits, such as eye color, height, or disease risk, that are passed on from parent to child. This reaction will be measured by studying patient blood that will be collected before and during treatment until there is disease progression.
