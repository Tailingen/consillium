Infusion of Depleted T Cells Following Unrelated Donor Stem Cell Transplant (ICAT)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the administration of allodepleted donor T cells to patients with haematological malignancies after stem cell transplant can improve the recovery of the patients immune system.
Haematological Malignancies
BIOLOGICAL: CD25/71 allodepleted donor T-cells
Circulating CD3+ve T cell count at 4 months post-SCT, 4 months post transplant
Incidence of grade II-IV acute and chronic GVHD, 1 year post transplant|Time to recovery of normal T-cell (>700/uL) and CD4 (>300/uL) counts and normal TCR diversity as assessed by Vb spectratyping, 1 year post transplant|In vitro anti-viral responses of circulating PBMC, 1 year post transplant|Transplant related mortality at 1 year post-SCT, 1 year post transplant|Disease-free survival at 1 year post-SCT, 1 year post transplant
