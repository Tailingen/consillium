A Study to Evaluate the Safety of Concurrent Durvalumab With CRT Followed by Durvalumab for Chinese Unresectable Stage III NSCLC
This is a prospective, multi-center, single arm study assessing the efficacy and safety of durvalumab given concurrently with platinum-based CRT (durvalumab + SoC CRT) in patients with locally advanced, unresectable NSCLC (Stage III).

Approximately 35 patients with locally advanced, unresectable NSCLC (Stage III) who are eligible to receive platinum-based CRT will be enrolled in and receive durvalumab + SoC CRT. Patients with CR, partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD）based on Investigator assessment at the 16-week tumor evaluation following completion of SoC CRT will continue to receive durvalumab as consolidation treatment. Patients with RECIST 1.1-defined radiological progressive disease (PD) will proceed to follow-up.
