Comparative Efficiency of Three Regimen, CEFci, CEF and EC as Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Primary Breast Cancer
This is a phase IV, prospective, single-center, open-label, randomized, controlled study. Eligible patients are randomly assigned into three groups. The investigators propose to evaluate and compare the efficacy and safety of different neoadjuvant chemotherapies in women with primary breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: 5-FU（intravenous infusion）+epirubicin+cyclophosphamide|DRUG: 5-FU（intravenous bolus）+epirubicin+cyclophosphamide|DRUG: epirubicin+cyclophosphamide
Pathologic complete response （PCR）, pathological evaluation by Miller \& Payne Grading System. Pathological complete response (pCR) was defined as no histological evidence of invasive tumor cells in the breast. The presence of DCIS alone was considered as pCR (G5). Residual cancer consisting of scattered tumor cells, not directly measurable, was reported as near pCR (G4), up to four weeks after surgery
Number of Participants with Ⅲ° and Ⅳ° Adverse Events According to NCI-CTC, All adverse events that occur after the initiation of the treatment will be handled with utmost attention, and carefully documented. Investigator will identify the adverse events according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC) version 3.0, the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events.Development of a severe side effect will be an indication for drop-outs., at the last day of every chemotherapy cycle|Number of patients undergoing breast conserving surgery, up to a week after operation
