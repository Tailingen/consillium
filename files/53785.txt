Hydroxyurea in Treating Patients With Recurrent and/or Unresectable Meningioma
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of hydroxyurea in treating patients who have recurrent and/or unresectable meningioma.
Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors
DRUG: hydroxyurea
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine complete, partial, or stable response to hydroxyurea in patients with recurrent and/or nonresectable meningioma.
* Determine response at 2 years to this regimen in these patients.
* Determine overall and disease free survival of these patients after this regimen.
* Determine quality of life of these patients.
* Determine the toxicities of this regimen in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to grade of disease (I vs II or III).

Patients receive oral hydroxyurea daily for 2 years.

Quality of life is assessed before treatment, then every 3 months for 2 years.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients (30 per stratum) will be accrued for this study.
