Fluorescence-navigated Thoracoscopy for Detection of Small Pulmonary Nodules
Fluorescence-navigated thoracoscopic imaging with indocyanine green (ICG) is a novel technique for detection of small pulmonary nodules other than traditional radiography or intraoperative palpation. As a non-targeted fluorescent contrast agent, ICG accumulates in tumors by the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR), making the lesions fluoresce under fluorescent imaging. However, the optimal dosage and injection time of ICG are still under exploration. Hence, we perform this study in humans made up of four groups to determine the optimal time and dose.
Pulmonary Nodule, Solitary|Pulmonary Nodule, Multiple
PROCEDURE: Preoperative Infusion of Indocyanine Green
Signal-to-background Ratio (SBR) of the Tumor and Normal Parenchyma, We use image analysis software ImageJ to evaluate the strength of luminosity in tumors and normal parenchyma using intraoperative images and calculate signal-to-background-ratios., within 1 week after surgery
