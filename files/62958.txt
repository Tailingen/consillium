Amonafide in Combination With Cytarabine in Secondary AML
This protocol is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of amonafide in combination with cytarabine in subjects with previously untreated secondary AML.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Amonafide L-Malate|DRUG: Cytarabine
- To determine the rate of complete remission with or without complete hematopoietic recovery (CR + CRi).
Determine the median duration of complete remission with or without complete hematopoietic recovery (CR or CRi)|Determine the proportion of subjects remaining in complete remission (CR +CRi) at 6 months, at 12 months and at 18 months|Determine the median duration of overall survival (OS)|Correlate clinical responses and duration of responses with specific cytogenetic abnormalities|Define the population pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of amonafide and its metabolites when administered as an intravenous infusion daily x 5 days in combination with a standard-dose of cytarabine|Define the safety profile and confirm the acceptability of amonafide and cytarabine|Correlate PK exposure of amonafide and acetylation of amonafide with safety and efficacy assessments in individual subjects
This is a two-stage, open-label, phase 2, multicenter study of amonafide L-malate in combination with standard-dose cytarabine in subjects with secondary AML.

Amonafide is a DNA intercalating agent and inhibitor of topoisomerase II that has been extensively studied in patients with malignant solid tumors. Amonafide has also been studied in patients with AML. In three phase I clinical trials, amonafide demonstrated anti-leukemic activity, both as monotherapy and in combination with cytarabine. This protocol is designed to further assess the safety and efficacy of amonafide in combination with cytarabine in subjects with previously untreated secondary AML.

The duration of the study is approximately 42 months: enrollment approximately 18 months and subject duration up to 24 months
