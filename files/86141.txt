Virtual Reality Colonoscopy : a Study From Nancy
Colonoscopy is an exam which can be responsible for pain and discomfort for the patient.

Therefore colonoscopy is performed most of the time under general anaesthesia. Moreover, drug-induced sedation comes with adverse effects especially among fragile patients.

Besides, monitoring patients during and after sedation is both logistically demanding and costly.

Virtual reality offers immersive and three dimensional experiences that distract the attention and might improve patients comfort.

The aim of the study is to investigate the use of virtual reality during colonoscopy versus general anaesthesia.
