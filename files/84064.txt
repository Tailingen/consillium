Fluoxetine for the Modification of Colorectal Tumor Immune Cells Before Surgery in Patients With Colorectal Cancer
This phase I trial tests whether fluoxetine (prozac) works to modify the tumor immune cells before surgery in patients with colorectal cancer. Fluoxetine is a commonly used selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) prescribed for major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety. Giving fluoxetine may modify the immune cell composition in the tumor and its microenvironment and may induce changes in body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread in patients with colorectal cancer.
Colorectal Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: Fluoxetine
Immune cell composition and microenvironment, Will be assessed by changes in the immune cell composition in the tumor and its microenvironment before and after exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors therapy. Fixed tumor samples will be analyzed by immunohistochemistry for immune cell tumor infiltration and relevant lineage/activation/exhaustion markers. Will use descriptive statistics and graphical displays to compare the changes in tumor immune markers between the pre- and post-treatment tissue., within a year of surgery
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To evaluate alterations in tumor immune cell composition and activity under SSRI treatment.

OUTLINE:

Patients receive fluoxetine orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 10 days prior to surgery.
