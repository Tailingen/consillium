Radiotherapy for Solid Tumor Spine Metastases
Although it is being increasingly used off protocol, there is minimal data regarding the efficacy of stereotactic radiosurgery to the tumor bed following surgical resection of metastatic lesions to the spine. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate radiographic local recurrence in the tumor bed following stereotactic radiosurgery compared to the expected rate following conventional radiation therapy.

Number of Participants With Radiographic Recurrence at 12 Months, To estimate the rate of radiographic local recurrence at 12 months in patients treated with a post-operative stereotactic radiosurgery boost for resected spine metastases., 1 year|Time to Local Recurrence, To estimate the time (in months) to radiographic local recurrence in patients treated with a post-operative stereotactic radiosurgery boost for resected spine metastases., 1 year
Number of Participants Receiving Re-treatment, To estimate the rate of re-treatment at 12 months in patients treated with a post-operative stereotactic radiosurgery boost for resected spine metastases, 1 year|Number of Participants With Symptomatic Recurrence, To estimate the rate of symptomatic local recurrence at 12 months in patients treated with a post-operative stereotactic radiosurgery boost for resected spine metastases, 1 year|Number of Participants Experiencing Radiation Myelopathy, Number of participants experiencing radiation myelopathy in patients treated with a post-operative stereotactic radiosurgery boost for resected spine metastases, 1 year|Number of Participants Experiencing Wound Dehiscence, Number of participants treated with a post-operative stereotactic radiosurgery boost for resected spine metastases, experiencing wound dehiscence., 1 year|Time to Return to Chemotherapy, Time in months to return to chemotherapy in patients treated with a post-operative stereotactic radiosurgery boost for resected spine metastases., 1 year|Number of Participants With Radio-sensitive Tumors Who Had Symptomatic Local Recurrence, To evaluate the post-treatment symptomatic local recurrence in patients with radio-sensitive tumors., 1 year
This is a phase II trial evaluating the rate radiographic local recurrence following post-operative stereotactic radiosurgery boost in patients with metastatic solid malignancies with spine metastases status post resection. Patients will be treated with 600 cGy x 5 fractions to the tumor bed and then followed both clinically and radiographically to determine if local recurrence following this treatment is better than might be expected for conventional radiation therapy.
