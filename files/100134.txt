Safety & Radiation Distribution Study of Cotara® in Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme
RATIONALE: Cotara® is an experimental new treatment that links a radioactive isotope (iodine 131) to a targeted monoclonal antibody. This monoclonal antibody is designed to bind tumor cells and deliver radiation directly to the center of the tumor mass while minimizing effects on normal tissues. Cotara® thus literally destroys the tumor "from the inside out." This may be an effective treatment for glioblastoma multiforme, a malignant type of brain cancer.

PURPOSE: This trial is studying the safety and radiation distribution of Cotara® in patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.
Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme
DRUG: 131-I-chTNT-1/B MAB
To confirm dose limit and maximum tolerated dose and to characterize radiation distribution
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To confirm the dose limiting toxicities (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 131I-chTNT-1/B MAb (Cotara®) when given as a single 25 hour interstitial infusion in patients with recurrent GBM
* To characterize the biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of Cotara®

OUTLINE:

This is an open-label, dose escalation study of Cotara®.

All patients will receive 3 mCi of Cotara® for biodistribution and radiation dosimetry purposes. In addition, patients will receive escalating therapeutic dose levels of Cotara® for confirmation of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for a minimum of 12 weeks and until disease progression.
