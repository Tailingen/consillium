Detection of Cancer in Breath Samples by Trained Detection Dogs
The goal of this study is to show that trained detection dogs can identify breast, lung, prostate or colorectal cancer by sniffing masks containing breath samples. In this study, individuals who will undergo cancer screening at an integrated cancer prevention center or biopsy for a suspected malignancy, will be asked to provide a breath sample by breathing into a surgical mask. The mask will then be sent to the laboratory, where trained detection dogs will determine if the person who provided the mask has breast, lung, prostate or colorectal cancer or if the person does not have these types of cancer. The results provided by the dogs will be compared to the actual cancer screening results or biopsy results in order to determine the accuracy of cancer detection by the trained dogs.

Specificity of detection of any cancer (breast, lung, prostate or colorectal cancer) by the breath test., Specificity is defined as the number of participants who were identified by the breath sample test as negative for cancer divided by the number of participants who were identified by the gold standard test as being negative for cancer., 2 years|Sensitivity of detection of any cancer (breast, lung, prostate or colorectal cancer) by the breath test., Sensitivity is defined as the number of participants who were identified by the breath sample test as positive for cancer divided by the number of participants who were identified by the gold standard test as being positive for cancer., 2 years
