Integrative Analysis of CRC Liver Metastasis
The investigators will perform integrative analysis of CRC liver metastasis
Metastasis
OTHER: normal colorectal tissues
5 years overall survival, 5 years
5 years disease-free survival, 5 years
The investigators will analyzed proteomes of paired normal colorectal tissues and colorectal cancer (CRC) with or without liver metastasis, sequenced transcriptomes, performed whole exome sequencing, and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array profiling for triplets, each comprising normal colorectal tissue, primary colorectal carcinoma, and its synchronous matched liver metastasis, as well as analyzed genomics of CRC characterized previously by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to conduct integrated proteogenomic analyses.
