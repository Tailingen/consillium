Vulnerability and Therapeutic Changes in Older Patients With Multiple Myeloma.
The aim of this study is to determine whether the presence of vulnerability detected by geriatricians is associated with treatment discontinuation in older patient. During the comprehensive geriatric assessment realized before the decision-treatment, the following data are recorded and their impact in the therapeutic changes will also be analysed: comorbidity, age, depression, functional status, the cognitive impairment and malnutrition.
