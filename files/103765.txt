Neoadjuvant Pembrolizumab and Axitinib in Renal Cell Carcinoma With Inferior Vena Cava Tumor Thrombus
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate whether the combination of Pembrolizumab and Axitinib given in the neoadjuvant setting can change the Inferior Vena Cava Tumor Thrombus burden. A decrease in the size of the tumor thrombus can potentially lead to decrease in surgical complications, improve patient related health outcomes, and improve long term outcomes such as progression free survival and overall survival.

DRUG: Axitinib|DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Evaluate Change in IVC Tumor Thrombus Extent Based on the Mayo Classification, * Patients will get baseline imaging with an MRI of the abdomen to evaluate the level of the IVC TT based on the Mayo Classification. Patients will get an end of treatment MRI at 12 weeks to evaluate the efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy with Pembrolizumab and Axitinib. The Mayo classification is described as below:
* Level 0: thrombus limited to the renal vein
* Level 1: into IVC \<2cm from renal vein ostium level
* Level 2: IVC extension \>2cm from renal vein ostium and below hepatic vein
* Level 3: thrombus at the level of or above the hepatic veins but below the diaphragm
* Level 4: thrombus extending above the diaphragm, baseline and 12 weeks|Evaluate a change in IVC TT Size from Baseline, o Evaluation of IVC TT anteroposterior and transverse diameter will also be measured at baseline and the end of treatment at 12 weeks. The baseline largest diameter will be subtracted to the largest diameter as the end of treatment divided by the baseline largest diameter will be computed to evaluate the percentage change in the IVC TT size., baseline and 12 weeks
Evaluate Surgical Complications after the Neoadjuvant Combination of Pembrolizumab and Axitinib Among Patients with RCC with IVC TT, * Surgical morbidity will be graded based on the Clavien- Dindo Classification. This will be graded as below:
* Grade I: Any deviation from the normal post-operative course not requiring surgical, endoscopic, or radiological intervention (inc. certain drugs, physiotherapy and wound infections that are opened at the bedside)
* Grade II: Complications requiring drug treatments other than those allowed for Grade I complications (inc. blood transfusion and total parenteral nutrition (TPN))
* Grade III: Complications requiring surgical, endoscopic, or radiological intervention (IIIa=not under general anesthetic/IIIb=under general anesthetic)
* Grade IV: Life-threatening complications (inc. CNS complications requiring intensive care, but excludes transient ischemic attacks (TIAs)) (IVa=single-organ dysfunction (inc. dialysis)/IVb=multi-organ dysfunction)
* Grade V: Death of the patient, Date of surgery up to 30 days post operative or date of hospital discharge whichever occurs first|Safety profile of the combination of Axitinib and Pembrolizumab, Catalogue o Any grade adverse event

o Grade 3 or higher adverse event possibly, probably, or definitely related to study therapy All treatment related adverse events will be assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5.0, baseline to 30 days post operative|1 year Progression Free Survival, Progression-free survival is defined as any clinical or radiographic progression or death from any cause one year after enrollment in the study, baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months from study enrollment|1 year Overall Survival, One year- Overall survival. Overall survival is defined as death from any cause one year after enrollment in the study, 12 months from study enrollment
Patients will receive the combination of Axitinib 5 mg orally twice daily (can be increased to 7 mg twice daily after 2 weeks, and further to 10 mg twice daily as tolerated) and Pembrolizumab 200 mg IV every 21 days. This combination will be given for a total of 12 weeks (4 cycles). A radiographic assessment will be done up to 12 weeks (4 cycles of therapy) to evaluate the primary endpoint of IVC TT response. Patients will undergo a definitive surgery per treating urologist within 2 weeks (+/- 7 days) after the end of treatment scan.

During the course of the trial, patient-related health outcomes using Kidney Cancer validated questionnaires with FKSI-DRS and FKSI-19 will also be obtained. These are validated paper questionnaires that will be given to each patient on study visits while receiving neoadjuvant therapy.
