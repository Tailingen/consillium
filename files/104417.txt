This study compares HP802-247 versus an antibiotic ointment for healing the wound after Mohs surgery.
Non-melanoma Skin Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: HP802-247|BIOLOGICAL: Bacitracin Ointment
The Primary Efficacy Measure Was the Investigator's Global Assessment of Healing (IGAH)., The IGAH is a four-point scale based on the following assessment scores: 0 = not effective, 1 = slightly effective, 2 = moderately effective, 3 = very effective. The descriptive statistics for both a continuous variable and a categorical variable were summarized for IGAH by treatment week and treatment endpoint. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to test the difference in IGAH score between HP802-247 and bacitracin ointment for each treatment week and treatment endpoint. Since this was a small and exploratory study, the P-value of a 1-sided test was reported., 13 weeks- The IGAH was measured at study Weeks 4 and 13
The Number of Subjects With Complete Wound Closure at Each Evaluation Visit., Complete wound closure was assessed at each evaluation visit., Over 12 weeks or until wound closure, which ever occurred first. Following completion of treatment subjects were followed for a further 4 weeks|Time in Days to Wound Closure, The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to calculate the mean time in days to complete wound closure., Over the 12 week treatment period|Investigator Reported Signs and Symptoms, Investigator reported signs and/or symptoms, based on the following 12 items, each scored as none (=0), mild (=1), moderate (=2), or severe (=3): Erythema, Erosion, Ulceration, Swelling, Scarring, Infection, Crusting, Necrosis, Peeling, Contact Dermatitis, Hyper/Hypopigmentation. Item scores were averaged., At each evaluation visit: Weeks 3 and 12 post-surgery.|Subject Reported Signs and Symptoms, Subjects reported signs or symptoms, based on the following 6 items, each scored as none (=0), mild (=1), moderate (=2), or severe (=3): irritation, itchiness, burning, tenderness, pain, and stinging.
