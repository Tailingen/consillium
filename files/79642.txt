German Multicenter Trial for Treatment of Newly Diagnosed Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in Adults (06/99)
The study evaluates the efficacy and tolerability of an intensified induction and consolidation therapy. Thereafter patients receive individualised treatment stratified according to relapse risk with stem cell transplantation for patients with high and very high risk of relapse. Patients with standard risk receive further consolidation and reinduction chemotherapy. In parallel minimal residual disease (MRD) is evaluated. A MRD based risk stratification and treatment decision is developed.
