Assess Efficacy and Safety of AZD6244 in Combination With Docetaxel in Patients Receiving Second Line Non Small Cell Lung Cancer Treatment.
The purpose of this study is to treat patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with a combination therapy of selumetinib and two different doses of docetaxel 75mg/m2 or 60 mg/m2 vs placebo and compare how well each dose affects how their cancer responds. It will also help us to understand the tolerability profile of the different dosing regimens in these patients
Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer Stage IIIb - IV
DRUG: Selumetinib 75 mg|DRUG: Docetaxel 75 mg/m2|DRUG: Docetaxel 60 mg/m2|DRUG: Placebo
Progression Free Survival (PFS), Median time from randomisation until the date of objective disease progression or death (by any cause in the absence of progression). Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST v1.1): \>= 20% increase in the sum of diameters of Target Lesions (TL) and an absolute increase in sum of diameters of \>=5mm (compared to the previous minimum sum) or progression of Non TLs or a new lesion., Baseline and then every 6 weeks after randomization until objective disease progression, up to 29 months (at the time of the analysis)
Overall Survival (OS), The time from randomisation until death due to any cause. Any subject not known to have died at the time of analysis will be censored based on the last recorded date on which the subject was known to be alive, Following progression, survival status was collected every 8 weeks until death, withdrawal of consent, or end of study, whichever occurred first, up to 29 months (at the time of the analysis)
A Phase II, Double-Blind, Randomised, Placebo-Controlled Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of Selumetinib (AZD6244; ARRY-142886) (Hyd-Sulfate) in Combination with Docetaxel, Compared with Placebo in Combination with Docetaxel, in Patients receiving second line treatment for Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (Stage IIIB - IV)
