Exercise Preconditioning in Ovarian Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine if exercise preconditioning can mitigate the off target effects of chemotherapy treatment on measures of cardiovascular function, peripheral neuropathy, and quality of life.
Ovarian Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: High intensity interval exercise|BEHAVIORAL: Attention control
VO2 Peak, Change in VO2peak (L/min) measured at pre-surgery, pre-chemotherapy, and post chemotherapy, 22 weeks
Global Longitudinal Strain, Global longitudinal strain (%) will be used to assess changes in cardiac contractile function and be measured by echocardiogram at pre-surgery, pre-chemotherapy, and post-chemotherapy, 22 weeks|Ejection Fraction, Ejection fraction (%) will be used to assess changes in cardiac contractile function and be measured by echocardiogram at pre-surgery, pre-chemotherapy, and post-chemotherapy, 22 weeks|Diastolic Function, E' and A' (cm/s) will be used to calculate the E'/A' ratio to assess for diastolic dysfunction and be measured by echocardiogram at pre-surgery, pre-chemotherapy, and post-chemotherapy, 22 weeks|Brachial Artery Endothelium-Dependent Flow-Mediated Dilation, Changes in endothelial function as measured by brachial artery endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilation (%) at pre-surgery, pre-chemotherapy, and post-chemotherapy, 22 weeks|Carotid-Femoral Pulse Wave Velocity, Changes in arterial stiffness as measured by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (m/s) at pre-surgery, pre-chemotherapy, and post-chemotherapy, 22 weeks|Blood pressure, Changes in measures of central and brachial blood pressure (mmHg) at pre-surgery, pre-chemotherapy, and post-chemotherapy, 22 weeks|Peripheral Neuropathy, A Neuropen will be used to assess for peripheral neuropathy via changes in perception to pressure prior to chemotherapy, at cycle 4, and after cycle 6., 22 weeks|Peripheral Neuropathy as assessed by the FACT-GOG-NTX Questionnaire, The functional assessment of cancer therapy/gynecologic oncology group- neurotoxicity (FACT-GOG-NTX) questionnaire is used to assess symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. This 38 item questionnaire utilizes the same questions as the FACT questionnaire with 11 questions specific to peripheral neuropathy. A 5 point Likert scale is used for each question and subscores are added together with high scores indicating better quality of life, 22 weeks|Health Related Quality of Life as Measured by the FACT-O Questionnaire, The functional assessment of cancer therapy- ovarian cancer(FACT-O) questionnaire is used to assess health-related quality of life specific to cancer and includes a subscale for ovarian cancer. This 38 item questionnaire utilizes the same questions as the FACT questionnaire with 12 questions specific to ovarian cancer. A 5 point Likert scale is used for each question and subscores are added together with high scores indicating better quality of life, 22 weeks|Quality of Life as Assessed by the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), The Short Form Health survey is a 36 item questionnaire that is used to measure general health and quality of life. Responses in each section are scored on a scale of 0-100 (with 100 indicating good health) and averaged together for each subscale score., 22 weeks
NTproBNP, Assess changes in NTproBNP (pg/ml) as a biomarker of myocardial strain at pre-surgery, pre-chemotherapy, and post-chemotherapy, 22 weeks|Inflammation, C-reactive protein (mg/dl) will be used as a biomarker for inflammation to be measured at pre-surgery, pre-chemotherapy, and post-chemotherapy, 22 weeks|Lipids, A lipid panel will be performed to measure total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoproteins, and low-density lipoprotein (mg/dl) to assess changes in cardiometabolic health at pre-surgery, pre-chemotherapy, and post-chemotherapy, 22 weeks|Insulin, Fasting insulin levels (U/ml) will be tested to assess changes in cardiometabolic health at all 3 time points, 22 weeks|Fasting Blood Glucose, Fasting blood glucose levels (mg/dl) will be tested to assess changes in cardiometabolic health at pre-surgery, pre-chemotherapy, and post-chemotherapy, 22 weeks
While survivorship for those diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer has continued to improve, the significant off target effects of adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy have become more prominent. These off-target effects include increased risk of cardiovascular disease, neuropathy, and decreased quality of life. Exercise initiated prior to chemotherapy induction and continued through treatment has promise in terms of preserving VO2peak and potentially mitigating the negative cardiovascular and neuropathic effects of chemotherapy. The goal of this study is to examine the effects of initiating exercise prior to any oncologic therapy and sustaining this exercise paradigm in newly diagnosed women with ovarian cancer who are undergoing initial surgery and chemotherapy.
