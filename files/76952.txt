A Pilot Study of Single Fraction Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) in Central Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine if a single treatment of targeted radiation (called SBRT or Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy) can be as safe and effective as multiple doses of radiation in patients with central non-small cell lung cancer
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
RADIATION: SBRT
Rate of grade 3-5 adverse events, Rates of treatment related grade 3-5 adverse events. Assessed using CTCAE v.5, Up to 5 years
Progression-free Survival, Progression free is defined as time from initiation of SBRT to disease progression or death from any cause. Estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method., Up to 5 years|Overall Survival, Overall Survival is defined as time from initiation of SBRT to patient death from any cause. Estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method., UP to 5 years|Quality of life scores, Comparison of QoL scores between time points will be made using the Wilcoxon signed rank test, Up to 5 years|Local Control Rate, Local control is defined as absence of local failure among patients evaluable for efficacy, Up to 5 years
