Boron Neutron Capture Therapy, Radiation Therapy, and Temozolomide in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme
RATIONALE: Boron neutron capture therapy and radiation therapy use high-energy x-rays and other types of radiation to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving boron neutron capture therapy followed by radiation therapy and temozolomide may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of giving boron neutron capture therapy together with radiation therapy and temozolomide in treating patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.
Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors
RADIATION: BNCT(boron neutron capture therapy)|RADIATION: XRT(X-ray radiation treatment)|DRUG: TMZ(temozolomide)
Overall survival (OS), Time to death from BSH injection（up to 6 years）
Tumor response（RECIST）, From BSH injection to the end of treatment, whichever came first, assessed up to 96 weeks|Objective Response Rate (ORR), From BSH injection to the end of treatment, whichever came first, assessed up to 96 weeks|Disease Control Rate (DCR), From BSH injection to the end of treatment, whichever came first, assessed up to 96 weeks|Adverse event, Time to final follow-up survey from the date of enrollment
OBJECTIVES:

* Evaluate the overall survival of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme treated with boron neutron capture therapy, radiotherapy, and concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide.
* Evaluate tumor response in patients treated with this regimen.
* Evaluate the adverse effects of this regimen in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients undergo boron neutron capture therapy followed by radiotherapy and concurrent and adjuvant oral temozolomide.
