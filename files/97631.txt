Safety and Pharmacokinetics of SM04755 in Subjects With Advanced Colorectal, Gastric, Hepatic, or Pancreatic Cancer
This is an open-label, multi-center, dose escalation study in adult subjects with advanced colorectal, gastric, hepatic or pancreatic cancer. The study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of SM04755 administered orally. Upon determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), expansion cohorts may be enrolled.
