Neuroendocrine Tumour (GI.NET)21 at EOCT Visit, The GI.NET21 module was intended for use among participants with gastrointestinal related (GI.- related) neuroendocrine tumours, who vary in disease stage and treatments. The module comprises 21 questions, consisting of 5 scales (endocrine symptoms, G.I. symptoms, treatment related symptom, social function, disease related worries) and 4 single items that assessed muscle /bone pain symptom, sexual function, information/communication function, and body image. Each question was quoted from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Each scale in the questionnaire was scored from 0 to 100. A higher value was equivalent to worse or more problems. Baseline was defined as the last non-missing measurement collected prior to the first dose of study drug (Day 1)., Baseline (Day 1) and EOCT visit (30 months)
