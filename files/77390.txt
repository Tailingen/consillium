Rasburicase (Fasturtec) Registration Trial
Primary:

To compare the efficacy of Rasburicase versus allopurinol in controlling tumor lysis-related hyperuricemia in Chinese patients with leukemia or lymphoma.

Secondary:

To compare the efficacy and safety of Rasburicase versus allopurinol in Chinese patients stratified according to disease (leukemia or lymphoma ).
