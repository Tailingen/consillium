Peripheral neuropathy (PN) is an adverse event of numerous chemotherapy agents commonly used, including taxanes (paclitaxel, docetaxel) and platinum-based treatments (oxaliplatine, cisplatine, carboplatine).

Taxanes are widely used in breast cancer. Docetaxel and paclitaxel became indispensable during the last decade in metastatic and early stage breast cancer treatment. For platinum-based chemotherapies, oxaliplatine is one of the main molecules used in digestive oncology, particularly in colorectal cancer.

The limiting toxicities of taxanes and platinum-based treatments which can lead to the therapeutic scheme modification (therefore to a potential diminution of efficacy and eventually to treatment stop) are mainly hematologic (neutropenia) and neurological, the most frequent neuro-toxicity event being a PN associated or not to neuropathic pains. The PN induced by chemotherapy can occur prematurely during the treatment course, persist between the treatments' cycles and last a long time after the end of cycles, with an impact on patients' quality of life. Symptoms are mainly sensitive, including pain, paresthesia and hands / foot numbness. These symptoms, as the hematologic toxicity, represent a major limiting factor for the treatment.

According to the ASCO recommendations, there is no effective prophylactic method against the chemo-induced PN. In a retrospective study, the chilled gloves used for preventing the nail lesions during chemotherapy may reduce the incidence of docetaxel-induced PN. Recently, the surgical gloves efficacy against paclitaxel-induced PN has been evaluated prospectively in women presenting a metastatic or early stage breast cancer, with a percentage of grade \>=2 NP significantly lower for the hand protected by surgical gloves than the control hand without glove (compression-induced vasoconstriction responsible for a blood flow reduction in the hands and therefore for the local exposure to chemotherapy agents) and a good tolerance.

Chilled gloves, which use the same principle of vasoconstriction through cold, are also used in the current practice for preventing the PN occurrence. However, contrary to surgical gloves, they can be not well tolerated since the very first cycles (intolerance to cold sensation).

The objective of this study is to evaluate the medium and long term efficacy of compression induced by surgical gloves against the PN development in two frequent indications in oncology, patients treated with paclitaxel (breast cancer) or oxaliplatine (colorectal cancer) and patients' satisfaction.
