Predictive Power of Share Wave Fibro Scan in HCC After HCV Infection
Shear wave electrography score allows stratification of HCC risk in a noninvasive and reliable way and can guide the surveillance strategy for HCC in patients with CLD
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Share wave fibro scan
Shear wave elastography score, it measures liver stiffness as it is a rapid technique taking less than 5 min that can be easily performed at bedside or in outpatient clinic,according to the manufacturer's recommendations and the machine scale result ranges from 2.5 to 75 kPa with normal value around 5.5 kPa, through study completion, an average of 1 year
Liver fibrosis is common to all chronic liver disease (CLD) , With time, this progressive disruption of hepatic architecture can develop into cirrhosis, characterized by "diffuse conversion of normal liver architecture into structurally abnormal nodules", About1% to 4% of patients with HCV-induced liver cirrhosis are diagnosed with HCC each year .

The historical gold standard for quantifying fibrosis is liver biopsy, but its invasive nature and potential for complications make it unpopular among patients and impractical for serial assessments of CLD. Furthermore, since histological lesions are not uniformly distributed across the liver parenchyma, this allows for large sampling error. The need for credible alternatives to biopsy has stimulated research into non-invasive methods of fibrosis assessment, including serum biomarkers , axial imaging and transient elastography.

FibroScanâ„¢ (Echosens, Paris, France) allows a non-invasive liver stiffness measurement (LSM), it is a relatively simple, highly reproducible and operator independent technique which examines an area 100 times that of a biopsy, reducing sampling bias , Shear wave elastography (SWE) measures LS by quantifying the velocity of shear waves produced in the liver tissue and uses a normal B-mode ultrasound probe for measuring LS in real time. In addition, SWE imaging using the Aixplorer system provides a high frame-rate and may be able to provide more accurate scoring of fibrosis .
