Primary Tumor Ablation and Outcome in Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Treated With Immunotherapy Combinations.
This is Phase IV, randomized, multi arm, multicenter, low interventional clinical trial, aiming to evaluate if treatment of primary tumor in mRCC patients with initial benefit to anti-PD1- based therapy (SOC) can improve the overall survival.

All patients eligible according to inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled and randomized to different treatment options based on tumor extension of the primary kidney cancer.

Those with primary kidney cancer ≤ 4 cm will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive:

* Cytoreductive Nephrectomy + standard of care (SOC) or
* RT on primary tumor + SOC or SOC alone.

Those with primary kidney cancer \> 4 cm will be randomized 1:1 to receive:

• Deferred Cytoreductive Nephrectomy + SOC or SOC alone. Patients randomized to Deferred Cytoreductive Nephrectomy can be treated with one among radical nephrectomy; partial nephrectomy or lumpectomy.

Patients randomized to RT should be treated with single shot of 25 Gy (or with multiple fractions with equivalent biological dose).

The SOC medical therapy is the continuation of the combination of medical therapy for mRCC including one of the available combination among axitinib + pembrolizumab or cabozantinib + nivolumab or lenvatinib + pembrolizumab or nivolumab alone after nivolumab + ipilimumab.

30-months Overall Survival for surgery vs. control, The primary endpoint of the study is to assess the difference in 30-months overall survival (OS) between patients who receive or not the deferred citoreductive nephrectomy (CN) while on therapy with SOC for mRCC., 30 months
Median overall survival for surgery vs. control, To assess the difference in overall survival (OS) between patients who receive or not the deferred citoreductive nephrectomy (CN) while on therapy with SOC for mRCC from the beginning of the anti-PD1-based therapy., 30 months|Median Progression Free Survival for surgery vs. control, To assess the difference in progression-free survival (PFS) between patients who receive or not the deferred citoreductive nephrectomy (CN) while on therapy with SOC for mRCC., 30 months|Median Overall Survival for radiotherapy vs. control, To assess the difference in overall survival (OS) between patients who receive or not the radiotherapy on primary tumor while on therapy with SOC for mRCC among those with primary tumor up to 4 cm at randomization., 30 months|Median Progression Free Survival for radiotherapy vs. control, To assess the difference in progression-free survival (PFS) between patients who receive or not the radiotherapy on primary tumor while on therapy with SOC for mRCC among those with primary tumor up to 4 cm at randomization., 30 months|Incidence of adverse events, To evaluate the safety of the CN and RT on primary tumor among patients receiving SOC for mRCC. Adverse events will be graded according to NCI CTCAE version 5.0., 30 months|Difference in EQ-5D-5L quality of life test, To evaluate the quality of life before and after 8 weeks from the surgery or radiotherapy on primary tumor among patients receiving SOC for mRCC evaluated by the questionnaires EQ-5D-5L., Baseline and 8 weeks after surgery or radiotherapy.|Difference in FKSI-19 quality of life test, To evaluate the quality of life before and after 8 weeks from the surgery or radiotherapy on primary tumor among patients receiving SOC for mRCC evaluated by the questionnaires FKSI-19., Baseline and 8 weeks after surgery or radiotherapy.|Incidence in of surgical complications., To evaluate the incidence of surgical complications by the Clavien- Dindo classification., 8 weeks after surgery
Difference in the proteomic profile, The study aims also to describe the change of proteome after surgery or radiotherapy on primary tumor compared to the baseline and to evaluate if specific proteome profiles at baseline are related to different outcomes. A blood tumor sample will be performed at the time of randomization for all patients and after eight weeks from CN or the end of RT to assess the proteomic profile., Before and 8 weeks after surgery or radiotherapy.
