New Chemotherapy Regimen in the Treatment of Advanced Gallbladder Carcinoma
Objective Primary:

Determine the objective response rate in patients with advanced gallbladder treated with new Chemotherapy regimen

Secondary:

Determine time to progression-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

Determine quality of life of patients treated with this regimen. Determine the toxicity of new chemotherapy regimen
Gallbladder Neoplasms
DRUG: Somatostatin|DRUG: epirubicin, cisplatin, LV（Leucovorin）、 5-FU（5-Fluorouracil）
(Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, RECIST,2009 ), CR(complete response) and PR(partial response), 6 month after first treatment
A: KPS (karnofsky performance score) B:Laboratory tests: Reexamination of CA19-9（Carbohydrate Antigen 19-9）、 CEA（ carcinoembryonic antigen）, especially for those which are abnormal prior to chemotherapy, 6 month after first treatment
Study Design: Treatment, Randomized, Open Label, controlled,Multicenter Group Assignment, Safety/Efficacy Study

Chemotherapy regimen:

Group A: Conventional chemotherapy regimen Group B: New chemotherapy regimen: conventional regimen plus SST（somatostatin） Cycles repeat every 4 weeks and 6 cycles in total

Patients: A total of 260 patients (130 per group) will be accrued for this study.

Patients distribution:

10patients per center are enrolled in the study and 30 centers (hospitals) in total which meet the total number of patients in trial.

Clinical Outcome Assessments:

Primary: the objective response rate (response evaluation criteria in solid tumors ,RECIST criteria) Secondary: progression-free survival, overall survival, quality of life，the adverse event

Safety Assessments:

Physical exam, laboratory test, probably occurred adverse event.
