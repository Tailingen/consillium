This is a prospective , interventional, open label, single arm, single center study.

The study is designed to evaluate the Feasibility and Safety of DaRT seeds for the treatment of Recurrent Lung Cancer. The study will be comprised of a screening period, DaRT insertion visit, acute follow-up phase of 4- 8 weeks and a long-term follow up phase of 3 months. The total duration of the study will be 3 months from the DaRT insertion procedure.

A total of 10 subjects will be enrolled to the study .

Eligible patients who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria (as assessed during the screening period) will be invited to the site for the procedure of DaRT seeds insertion. The patients will be monitored for a period of 3 months post insertion
