Correlation Between ADR of Screening and All Colonoscopies
The aim of the study is to compare ADR for colonoscopies from various indications and to find correlations between ADR of screening and all examinations.

correlation between ADR of screening and all colonoscopies (screening, surveillance, diagnostic), Pearson´s correlation coefficient, january 2013 - december 2017
ADR (adenoma detection rate) is generally accepted quality indicator and it is calculated from screening colonoscopies in patients over 50 years of age. For possible gaming with ADR for screening colonoscopies, monitoring of ADR for all colonoscopies is discussed nowadays.The aim of the study is to compare ADR for colonoscopies from various indications and to find correlations between ADR of screening and all examinations.

We want to retrospectively assess the quality indicators of all colonoscopies performed from January 2013 to December 2017. We want to calculate ADR for all colonoscopies in patients over 50 years of age excluding therapeutic, IBD, management of complications and sigmoidoscopies (screening, surveillance, diagnostic) and separately only for screening colonoscopies. Correlation analysis will be performed using Pearson´s correlation coefficient.
