Changes in body mass index, BMI measured with the formula BMI=weight \[kg\]/heightÂ² \[m\]., before and after 2, 4, 8 weeks of intervention|Changes in waist-to-hip ratio, Calculated with the formula: waist circumference/hip circumference., before and after 2, 4, 8 weeks of intervention|Changes in blood pressure, before and after 2, 4, 8 weeks of intervention
This study aims to evaluate the effects of NMN on reproductive endocrine and metabolism, chronic inflammation, and reproductive outcomes in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and to explore its underlying mechanisms to provide the intervention strategies for PCOS.
