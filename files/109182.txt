AZD2014 Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax) Following Single Dose, Fasted, no Fulvestrant., 1 Day|Time to AZD2014 Peak Plasma Concentration (Tmax) Following Single Dose, Fasted, no Fulvestrant., 1 Day|Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve for AZD2014 From 0 to 12 Hours (AUC 0-12) Following Single Dose, Fasted, no Fulvestrant., 1 Day|Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve for AZD2014 From 0 to Infinity (AUC 0-∞) Following Single Dose, Fasted, no Fulvestrant., 1 Day|Objective Response Rate, Objective Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the number (%) of patients with a confirmed overall response of either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)., Up to 12 months|Best Objective Response (BOR), Best objective response was the best response a patient had following start of treatment but prior to starting any subsequent cancer therapy and prior to RECIST v1.1 progression or the last evaluable assessment in the absence of RECIST v1.1 progression., Up to 12 months|Duration of Response (DoR), Duration of response is defined as the time from the date of first documented response until the date of documented progression or death in the absence of disease progression., Up to 12 months|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) at 24 Weeks, The Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) at 24 weeks is defined as the percentage of patients who had a confirmed BOR of CR or PR in the first 24 weeks or who demonstrated SD for a minimum interval of 24 weeks (minus 1 week to allow for an early assessment within the assessment window, i.e., 161 days) following the start of treatment., Up to 12 months|Percentage Change From Baseline at 16 Weeks in Target Lesion (TL) Size., Baseline was defined as last evaluable assessment prior to starting treatment. Tumour size was the sum of the longest diameters of the target lesions. TLs are measurable tumour lesions., Up to 12 months|Progression Free Survival, Up to 12 months|Progression Free Survival at 26 Weeks, Up to 12 months
