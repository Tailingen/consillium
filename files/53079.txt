Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) Positive Unresectable Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer Disease Registry Study
This disease registry is a prospective, multicenter non-interventional study designed to observe the different anticancer treatment regimens and their sequencing throughout the course of the disease in participants with unresectable locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) or metastatic breast cancer (mBC) and to describe the clinical outcome for each treatment regimen measured as progression-free survival.
