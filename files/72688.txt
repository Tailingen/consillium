NOTION: iN-home Sampling Of cyTokines in ImmunOtherapy patieNts
This study will explore the ability of patients on first line combination immunotherapy to sample cytokines at home. The data from this study will be used to evaluate the feasibility of in-home testing and the ability to analyse patients cytokine profiles retrospectively to help feed the development of further studies.

Patient adherence to protocol defined DBS time points., the number of DBS samples successfully collected against the number of total expected samples, 12 months|Number of in-home DBS samples passing quality assurance checks in patients receiving CPI therapy by multi-cytokine ELISA., the number of DBS samples passing quality assurance checks against the number of DBS samples successfully collected., 12 months
Compare cytokine concentrations by DBS sampling and intravenous blood sampling by multi-cytokine ELISA., The changes of cytokine concentrations will be estimated by the log-ratio of cytokine concentrations measured at two time points. The trend of cytokine concentration during treatment will be estimated by fitting a linear regression model based on all cytokine concentrations collected during treatment., 12 months
Retrospective mapping of immune-related adverse events with cytokine concentrations over time by in-home DBS sampling., The association between these statistics and the development of immune-related adverse events will be estimated using a logistic regression analysis., 12 months|Patient reported outcomes from semi-structured interviews., The patient satisfaction level will be assessed by survey interviews., 12 months
Patients will be informed of the study and given a minimum of 24 hours to consider. Once consented patients will enter the study where they will take cytokine samples at home over a 12 week period.
