Arterial Stiffness Index as a Predictor of Surgically Correctable Primary Aldosteronism
Our main objective is to assess whether aortic stiffness is a predictor of blood pressure response after surgery in patients with an aldosterone producing adenoma or a unilateral adrenal hyperplasia.
Adenoma
DEVICE: complier device
Responders to surgery, patients not receiving aldosterone antagonists, with mean-24h-ABP < 130/80 mmHg with or without antihypertensive treatment, 2 years
Day-time and night-time ABP and circadian BP variability, number of antihypertensive agents at 1 year after surgery, prediction of post-operative complications, prediction of cardiovascular morbidity at 1 year., 2 years
Secondary objectives are to investigate whether aortic stiffness predicts cardiovascular , operative and postoperative morbid-mortality at 1 year, to evaluate the benefit of adrenalectomy in patients with primary aldosteronism due to unilateral adrenal hyperplasia and in patients with aldosterone producing adenoma associated with controlateral adrenal morphological abnormalities, and to participate to a national DNA repository of patients with primary aldosteronism.
