A Study of JNJ-75276617 in Combination With Conventional Chemotherapy for Pediatric and Young Adult Participants With Relapsed/Refractory Acute Leukemias
The purpose of this study is to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose(s) (RP2Ds) of JNJ-75276617 in combination with a conventional chemotherapy backbone in pediatric and young adult participants with relapsed/refractory acute leukemia harboring histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2A1 (\[KMT2A1\], nucleophosmin 1 gene (NPM1), or nucleoporin alterations in Part 1 (Dose Escalation) and to further evaluate safety at the RP2D(s) of JNJ-75276617 in combination with chemotherapy in pediatric and young adult participants with relapsed/refractory acute leukemia harboring KMT2A1, NPM1, or nucleoporin alterations and safety at the RP2D(s) of JNJ-75276617 as monotherapy in a select low burden of disease cohort in Part 2 (Dose Expansion).

Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant participating in a clinical study that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the pharmaceutical/biological agent under study., Up to 3 years 5 months|Number of Participants with AEs by Severity, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant participating in a clinical study that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the pharmaceutical/biological agent under study. Severity will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 5.0. Severity scale ranges from Grade 1 (Mild) to Grade 5 (Death). Grade 1= Mild, Grade 2= Moderate, Grade 3= Severe, Grade 4= Life-threatening and Grade 5= Death related to adverse event., Up to 3 years 5 months|Number of Participants with Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT), Percentage of participants with DLT will be assessed. The DLTs are specific adverse events related to JNJ-75276617 and are defined as any of the following: high grade non-hematologic toxicity, or hematologic toxicity., Cycle 1 (28 days)
Plasma Concentration of JNJ-75276617, Plasma concentration of JNJ-75276617 will be reported., Up to 3 years 5 months|Number of Participants with Depletion of Leukemic Blasts, Number of participants with depletion of leukemic blasts will be reported., Up to 3 years 5 months|Number of Participants with Differentiation of Leukemic Blasts, Number of participants with differentiation of leukemic blasts will be reported., Up to 3 years 5 months|Changes in Expression of Menin-histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2A (KMT2A) Target Genes or Genes Associated With Differentiation, Changes in expression of menin-histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2A (KMT2A) target genes or genes associated with differentiation will be reported., Up to 3 years 5 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR) per Response Criteria in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve complete response (CR), CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) or CR with partial hematologic recovery (CRh) per the Response Criteria in AML., Up to 3 years 5 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR) per the Response Criteria in B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), ORR in participants with B-cell ALL is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve CR or CRi per the response criteria in B-cell ALL., Up to 3 years 5 months|Time to Response (TTR), TTR is defined for the responders as the time from the date of the first dose of JNJ-75276617 to the date of the first documented response., Up to 3 years 5 months|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR will be calculated among responders from the date of initial documentation of a response to the date of first documented evidence of relapse, as defined in the disease-specific response criteria, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 3 years 5 months|Percentage of Participants With Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT), Percentage of participants who receive an allogeneic HSCT after treatment will be reported., Up to 3 years 5 months
