Real-world Data (RWD) of Ramucirumab Plus Paclitaxel
Real World Data (RWD) obtained from real clinical sites is data obtained after administering a drug to patients with different characteristics in daily practice, and Real World Evidence (RWE) is established based on RWD. It is possible to overcome the disadvantage of RCT, which cannot reflect all the various variables in the actual clinical field as it is conducted for only subset of patients.

Researchers planned to prospectively collect RWD of ramucirumab/paclitaxel combination therapy as 2nd-line chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.

Most drugs are introduced into the medical market based on efficacy derived from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in a subset of patient groups in which the age, presence of comorbidities, and general conditions of the target patient are strictly controlled by the researcher.

Real World Data (RWD) obtained from real clinical sites is data obtained after administering a drug to patients with different characteristics in daily practice, and Real World Evidence (RWE) is established based on RWD. It is possible to overcome the disadvantage of RCT, which cannot reflect all the various variables in the actual clinical field as it is conducted for only subset of patients.

Researchers have collected retrospective RWD from patients who used ramucirumab/paclitaxel in a previous study (KCSG ST19-16). Considering the limitations of RWD obtained through retrospective data collection, it is necessary to generate RWE through RWD, which prospectively collects various clinical data obtained in the process of using new anticancer drugs.
