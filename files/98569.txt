Optimisation of Follicular Recruitment in IVM Cycles
The study will focus on important aspects related to follicle recruitment using exogenous gonadotropins in patients with polycystic ovaries:

1. Early follicle recruitment in patients with polycystic ovaries using corifollitropin alfa: does administration of this drug result in earlier and higher FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) concentrations above the threshold for follicle recruitment in an IVM (in vitro maturation) cycle preceded by oral contraceptive suppression, in comparison to normal daily administration of rFSH (recombinant follicle stimulating hormone, Puregon)?;
2. The maturation rate of the obtained oocyte-cumulus complexes in standard IVM media registered for clinical use: does stimulation with corifollitropin alfa versus recombinant FSH have an impact on the maturation rate and developmental capacity of the oocytes ?
