Post-authorization Safety Study on the Long Term Safety of Sonidegib in Patients With Locally Advanced Cell Carcinoma
Collect real world safety data on the use of sonidegib in adult patients with laBCC. Document major safety parameters such as on treatment deaths, adverse events (AEs)/ serious adverse events (SAEs) and discontinuation secondary to AEs.
Basal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: sonidegib
Proportion of patients with AEs/SAEs, including on-treatment deaths and discontinuation due to AEs/SAEs, 3 years
Proportion of patients with AEs of special interest (AESI) or populations, in patients with: relevant polymorphism, â‰¥65 yrs, hepatic or renal impairment, female patients with child bearing potential using anticonceptives, anemia (hemoglobin \<9 g/dL), recent myocardial ischemia or cardiac failure, concomitant medications with known risk of creatine kinase elevation, 3 years
This is a non-interventional, multinational, multi-center post-authorization safety study (PASS), to assess the safety of sonidegib administered in routine clinical practice in patients with laBCC who are not amendable to curative surgery or radiation therapy. This study is observational in nature and does not impose a therapy protocol, diagnostic/therapeutic interventions or a specific visit schedule. For this study, each enrolled patient will be followed up for 3 years after enrollment.
