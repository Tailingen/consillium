Evaluating an Anchored Transponder in Lung Cancer Patients Receiving Radiation Therapy
Clinical study investigating the feasibility and safety of using an anchored Calypso transponder in the airways of the lung for real-time monitoring of tumor location during radiotherapy
Lung Cancer
DEVICE: Implantation of anchored Beacon transponder in the lung
To Determine the Proportion of Patients Who Can be Localized by the Calypso System Using the Anchored Transponders., Whether a patient can be localized by the Calypso System using the anchored transponders will be determined during the first week (i.e., the first five fractions) of radiation therapy., 1-2 weeks following implantation
To Assess the Implantation Procedure of the Anchored Transponder in the Lung, The implantation procedure of the anchored transponder in the lung will be assessed with respect to a number of criteria: ability to implant transponders where intended, implanting physician's satisfaction with the process, and geometric configuration of the implanted transponders., 1-2 weeks following implantation|To Assess the Positional Stability of the Anchored Transponders Short Term Through the Completion of Radiotherapy and Long Term Through One Year of Follow-up., The positional stability of the anchored transponder configuration will be assessed using changes in intertransponder distance. Inter-transponder distance will be calculated from CT scans acquired at treatment planning (baseline), 2-4 subsequent follow-up CT scans acquired during radiation therapy, and 4 follow-up CT scans taking place between 10-13 months post-radiotherapy, 1-14 months, depending on the duration of radiotherapy and time between follow-up visits.|To Evaluate Adverse Events Associated With the Anchored Transponder and the Implantation Procedure, Adverse events associated with the anchored transponder and implantation procedure from the time of implantation through the completion of the follow-up period will be recorded and assessed., Time of implantation through the completion of the follow-up period of the study (0-14 months)|To Collect Target Localization and Tracking Data With the Calypso System During Radiation Treatment Sessions, Target localization and tracking data will be collected with the Calypso System during radiation treatment sessions., Depending on the type of radiation treatment, this will take place over the course of 1-2 weeks or 1-7 weeks|To Record Usability Data, Including User Intervention in Response to the Localization and Tracking Data During the Radiation Treatment Sessions, To record usability data, including user intervention in response to the localization and tracking data (e.g., pausing the bean, patient re-alignment, etc.) during the radiation treatment sessions., Depending on the type of radiation treatment, this will take place over the course of 1-2 weeks or 1-7 weeks|To Calculate the Potential Reduction in Volume and Dose of Normal Lung Irradiated When a Reduced Margin is Used for the Planning Target Volume, To calculate the potential reduction in volume and dose of normal lung irradiated when routine institutional planning target volume margins are reduced to a margin of 0.5 cm circumferentially made possible by realtime localization and tracking of the tumor. This calculation will be done for a subset of the patients., 1-2 weeks following implantation
The Calypso anchored lung transponders are a modified version of the previously FDA-cleared Calypso soft tissue transponders. This modification includes an anchoring mechanism to hold the transponder positionally stable within small airways of the lung. Transponders are placed locally to the tumor within the lung and during subsequent radiotherapy the Calypso system may be used to monitor the location of the transponders and, by extension, the tumor, in real-time. This allows for improved tumor-targeting as well as gating of the radiation beam when the tumor moves outside the target field during respiratory motion.

The goals of this investigation are to show that patients with implanted anchored transponders can be localized with the Calypso System, that anchored transponder implantation and use are feasible and safe, and that anchored transponders are positionally stable in the small airways of patients with cancer of the lung.
