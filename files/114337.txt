Open-label, Uncontrolled Phase II Trial of Intravenous PI3K Inhibitor BAY80-6946 in Patients With Relapsed, Indolent or Aggressive Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas
The objective of the study (part A) is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BAY80-6946 in patients with indolent or aggressive Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, who have progressed after standard therapy. 30 patients will be enrolled to both indolent and aggressive disease group. The objective of the study part B (CHRONOS-1) is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BAY80-6946 in patients with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma. 120 patients will be enrolled in the part B of the study. Further objectives are to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and biomarkers. Quality of life will be a further objective of part B of the study.

In a cohort of 20 patients (enrolled both in part A and B) an ECG substudy will be performed to assess the potential for cardiac toxicity and QT/QTc interval prolongation of BAY80-6946.

After an up to 28-day screening period, eligible patients will start treatment with BAY80-6946 at a dose of 0.8 mg/kg (Part A) and at a dose of 60 mg (Part B).

Treatment will be continued until disease has progressed or until another criterion is met for withdrawal from study. An end-of-treatment visit will be performed within 7 days after discontinuation of study treatment. Thirty to 35 days after last study drug administration, a safety followup visit will be performed for the collection of adverse events (AEs) and concomitant medication data. Patients will be contacted quarterly to determine overall survival status up to 4 years after last patient completed treatment. Patients who discontinue study drug for reasons other than disease progression will enter the Active Assessment Follow-up period. The end of study notification to Health Authorities will be based on the completion of the collection of survival data.

The efficacy is measured by the decrease in tumor size. Tumor assessments will be done at Screening, every 8 weeks during Year 1, every 12 weeks during Year 2, and every 6 months during Year 3. Blood samples will be collected for pharmacokinetic analysis. Archival tumor tissue and blood samples will be collected for biomarker analysis (mandatory) and for central pathology review (part B), fresh biopsy tissue will also be collected if available.

Duration of Response (DOR) Based on Independent Review-Part A, DOR was defined as the time from the date of the first observed tumor response of CR or PR (whichever was noted earlier) to first subsequent disease progression (either first progressive disease \[PD\], first clinical progression or first AE associated with clinical disease progression) or death caused by disease progression, if this death occurred before progression was documented. All deaths were considered as 'caused by disease progression' except deaths with the reason "other" or "AE not related to disease progression. DOR was evaluated only for patients with at least one tumor response of CR, CRu, or PR. Some patients may have had no report of disease progression nor death caused by disease progression until the date of the LPLV. With regards to DOR, these patients were considered as right censored at the date of their last tumor assessment after first observed tumor response., Baseline up to approximately 6 years|DOR Based on Independent Review-Part B, DOR was defined as the time from the date of the first observed tumor response of CR or PR (whichever was noted earlier) to first subsequent disease progression (either first progressive disease \[PD\], first clinical progression or first AE associated with clinical disease progression) or death caused by disease progression, if this death occurred before progression was documented.

It contains 42 items (questions) covering HRQoL, common lymphoma symptoms and treatment side-effects. The FACT - General (FACT-G) questionnaire contains 27 items covering 4 core HRQoL subscales: Physical Wellbeing (7 items), Social/Family Wellbeing (7), Emotional Wellbeing (6), and Functional Wellbeing (7). The FACT-Lym also includes an Additional Concerns subscale (15 items) (FACT-Lym LymS), addressing issues typically experienced by lymphoma patients. Some of the issues covered include pain, itching, night sweats, trouble sleeping, fatigue and trouble concentrating. FACT-Lym also asks patients about lumps and swelling, fevers, infections, weight, appetite, emotional stability and treatment. Score range for the FACT-Lym LymS was 0 - 60, higher score represent less symptoms.
