Exploratory Study of MSLN-CAR T Cells Secreting PD1/CTLA-4 Nanoantibody for the Treatment of Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a single arm, open-label, dose escalation clinical study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of autologous mesothelin (MSLN)-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (MSLN-CAR) T cells secreting PD-1 and CTLA-4 nanobodies (αPD1/CTLA-4-MSLN-CAR T cells) in patients with solid tumors.
