Laparoscopic Versus Open Liver Resection in the Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to investigate the clinical value of laparoscopic liver resection in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma by assessing its Surgical and oncologic outcomes comparing with open liver resection.
