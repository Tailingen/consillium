Comparison of Bi-level Erector Spine Plane Block and Combined Pectoral I-II Block in Breast Surgery
In this study, we compared ultrasound-guided modified pectoral nerve (PECS) block and bi level erector spinae plane (ESP) block on postoperative analgesic effect in breast surgery.
Postoperative Pain|Analgesia
OTHER: Ultrasound guided bi-level erector spinae plane block|OTHER: Ultrasound guided modified pectoral nerve block
Morphin consumption, Patients in both groups will provide with intravenous patient-controlled analgesia device containing morphine for postoperative analgesia., during postoperative 24 hour|numerical rating scale (NRS), A numerical rating scale (NRS) requires the patient to rate their pain on a defined scale. For example, 0-10 where 0 is no pain and 10 is the worst pain imaginable, during postoperative 24 hour
After being informed about the study and potential risks, written consent was obtained from all patients. Patients who meet eligibility requirements will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to bi- level erector spinae plane block and modified pectoral block.
