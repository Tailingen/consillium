Screening Test Accuracy of Gynocular™, HR-HPV Testing, VIA for Detection of Cervical Neoplastic Lesions, in Women Living With HIV
Cervical cancer in HIV-positive women is largely preventable through regular screening. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends cervical screening for HIV-positive women every three years. Currently the least costly method for screening and the most viable option for many countries is visual inspection after application of acetic acid (VIA). Alternative testing methods are HPV testing and assessment with a portable magnification device. The investigators plan to assess and compare the screening test accuracy of these screening tests in women living with HIV. All women will receive histopathology reference standard.

Safety outcomes: For each adverse event found the investigators will calculate crude frequencies, Adverse events will be recorded. The investigators will ask participants to inform the study nurse or assistant if they develop any of these, in person or by phone. Given the health system in this context is not centralized, it is most efficient to ask participants to report these to the clinical team and investigators. Information describing these events will include: time of onset, duration, resolution, action to be taken, assessment of intensity, relationship with study treatment. The clinical team will also complete assessments of seriousness, causality and expectedness. Participants are asked to inform the clinical team immediately if any AE occur in the 9 months following their initial enrolment. At each visit, the Study nurse/assistant will also inquire about any adverse events that have occurred, for verification. For each adverse event found the investigators will calculate crude frequencies., 9 months
The simplest and least costly method for cervical cancer screening is visual inspection after application of acetic acid (VIA). However, the ability of this screening method to correctly identify precancerous lesions (sensitivity) and women free from these lesions (specificity) is limited. The investigators aim to identify alternative screening methods which maximize sensitivity and specificity, particularly in HIV-infected women in receiving care in Southern Africa. The investigators will evaluate the screening test accuracy of a new portable magnification device , the Gynocular™ with Swede score assessment, in women who are HIV-positive and eligible for cervical cancer screening. The investigators will assess the accuracy of the device when used as a stand alone test, as well as when used subsequent to positive VIA or HPV tests. The investigators will make comparisons with current screening practices (VIA alone), as well as, recommended screening practices (HPV testing). The investigators will enrol 450 HIV-positive women receiving care for HIV/AIDS at the Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, in Lusaka, Zambia. Consenting women will be screened with VIA, HPV testing and visual assessment with Gynocular™. All women undergo biopsy (reference standard) and receive treatment as indicated and in accordance with national guidelines.
