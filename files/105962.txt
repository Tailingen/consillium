Tracking Triple-negative Breast Cancer Evolution Through Therapy
A prospective multicentre study which aims to examine the relationship between intratumour heterogeneity (ITH) and pathological response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with histological confirmation of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) who are eligible for neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Triple-Negative Breast Neoplasm
PROCEDURE: Biopsy|PROCEDURE: Biopsy (optional)|PROCEDURE: Biopsy (metastatic)
Rate of pathological complete response (pCR), pCR is defined as the absence of residual invasive cancer on hematoxylin and eosin evaluation of the complete resected breast specimen and all sampled ipsilateral lymph nodes (i.e., ypT0/Tis ypN0 in the current American Joint Committee on Cancer \[AJCC\] staging system), pCR will be defined at the time of surgery on the tumor specimen
Invasive disease-free survival, the time from neoadjuvant treatment initiation until the date of the first occurrence of one of the following events: invasive ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence (same breast), local /regional invasive recurrence, invasive contra lateral breast cancer, appearance of metastasis, second primary invasive cancer (non-breast cancer), ipsilateral ductal carcinoma in situ, contralateral ductal carcinoma in situ, death attributable to any cause., from surgery until 5 years post-surgery|Overall survival, the time from neoadjuvant treatment until death due to any cause, from surgery until 5 years post-surgery
