Virtual Health Insurance Navigation Pilot Program for Colorectal Survivors
This trial aims to assess the feasibility and acceptability of colorectal survivors approached and engaged in HINT and aims to assess the preliminary efficacy of HINT to improve 1) health insurance literacy and 2) financial burden related to medical cost concerns colorectal survivors. The study investigators propose that, compared to the control arm (who will receive a health insurance information guide, but will not receive the navigation intervention), participants in the HINT intervention arm will have improved health insurance literacy and decreased financial distress related to medical costs.

Acceptability of the Health Insurance Navigation Program, 10-point (1-10; 1= least helpful and 10= most helpful) scale rating of program quality, including the following (higher scores indicate higher levels of acceptability)-, 5 month follow-up|Change From Baseline Health Insurance Literacy to 5-month Follow-up, 16 items with a 4-category Likert scale ranging from 16-64 (higher scores denoting lower literacy) of confidence on understanding of health insurance terms (higher scores indicate higher levels of health insurance literacy). We report mean health insurance literacy change from baseline to follow-up. Scale adapted from the Urban Institute Health Reform Monitoring Survey-

* premium
* deductible
* co-payments
* co-insurance, baseline and 5 month follow-up|Program Feasibility, Program feasibility is measured by the percentage of navigator participants completing all 5 intervention sessions., 5-month follow-up
With support from the American Cancer Society, Dr. Park designed a 5-session health insurance navigation treatment program, Health Insurance Navigation Tools (HINT), that is currently being delivered remotely, as a collaboration with the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study. Given the current insurance landscape and the additional insurance burden that adult colorectal cancer survivors face, the present study seeks to conduct a pilot trial with the existing health insurance intervention and adult colorectal cancer survivors seen at MGH Cancer Centers to improve health insurance literacy and decrease financial burden related to medical costs. The present study seeks to develop and pilot a health insurance navigation program with adult colorectal cancer survivors recruited from MGH. Patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer have a higher risk of experiencing financial burden related to health care costs when compared to patients diagnosed with other types of cancer. While many cancer survivors report experiencing financial burden, financial burden is particularly acute among survivors of colorectal cancer. Outcomes of financial burden among colorectal cancer survivors include lower health related quality of life, employment concerns, and delay or lack of engagement in needed surveillance and follow-up care.

Understanding and navigating insurance benefits in the current landscape is crucial for colorectal cancer survivors to obtain and utilize the health care that they need. With this in mind, the study investigators propose to develop and pilot an insurance navigation intervention to examine its feasibility and acceptability among colorectal cancer survivors receiving care at the MGH.
