A Clinical Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Biologic Effect of VG2025 in Patients with Solid Tumors
VG2025 is a Recombinant Human IL12/15 Dual-Regulated Oncolytic HSV-1 Injection. This Phase I study will be conducted in herpes simplex virus (HSV) -seropositive subjects with advanced malignant solid tumors that are refractory to conventional therapies. This is an open label study to determine the safety and tolerability of VG2025, and recommended dose of VG2025 for Phase II trials.

This is a Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation trial using standard 3+3 dose-escalation design in patients with advanced malignant solid tumors. The trial will be conducted in multiple dosing cohorts, and evaluated for safety to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D). Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) evaluation period is for 4 weeks from the start of treatment Day 1 through Day 28.
