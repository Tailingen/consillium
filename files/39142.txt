Changes in Tumor Tissue and Serum Biomarkers Before and After Cetuximab Combined With Preoperative Radiotherapy in Locally Advanced Thoracic Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
This study aim to investigate Changes in tumor tissue and serum biomarkers before and after cetuximab combined with preoperative radiotherapy in locally advanced thoracic middle-lower segment esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.We want to find one or more effective biomarkers to predict and evaluate the patients who will be benefit from cetuximab combined with preoperative radiotherapy.
Locally Advanced Thoracic Middle-lower Segment Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
RADIATION: preoperative radiotherapy|DRUG: cetuximab
Expression of Survivin protein in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma before and after Radiotherapy, Survivin, an inhibitor of apoptosis protein, is highly expressed in most cancers and associated with radiotherapy resistance, increased tumor recurrence, and shorter patient survival., before radiotherapy and 1 months after the radiotherapy|Expression of p53 in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma before and after Radiotherapy, p53 (also known as protein 53 or tumor protein 53), is a tumor suppressor protein that in humans is encoded by the TP53 gene.p53 is important in multicellular organisms and involved in preventing cancer., before radiotherapy and 1 months after the radiotherapy|changes of serum vascular endothelial growth factor（VEGF）level before and after radiotherapy, Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a signal protein produced by cells that stimulates vasculogenesis and angiogenesis., before radiotherapy and 1 months after the radiotherapy
Quality of life (QOL), Quality of life (QOL) as measured by European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30）, up to 3 years|Overall survival, time from randomization to death, up to 3 years|PFS（progression-free survival）, time from randomization to one of the following events, whichever comes first:

1. Tumor progression at any time (progression of primary tumor or local lymph nodes, appearance of new lesions)
2. Recurrence at local, regional or distant site after surgery
3. Death from any cause, up to 3 years|local control rate（LCR）, Time to locoregional failure after R0 resection, up to 3 years|Pathological remission, 1 months after the end of surgery|grade 3-5 adverse events, Grade 3-5 adverse events as assessed by NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects (CTCAE) v3.0，such as esophagitis、pneumonitis and hematologic toxicity, up to 3 years
