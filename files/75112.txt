ADP-A2M4CD8 as Monotherapy or in Combination With Either Nivolumab or Pembrolizumab in HLA-A2+ Subjects With MAGE-A4 Positive Tumors (SURPASS)
This study will investigate the safety and tolerability of ADP-A2M4CD8 T-cell therapy in subjects who have the appropriate human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and MAGE-A4 tumor antigen. Tumor indications include endometrial, esophageal, esophagogastric junction (EGJ), gastric, head and neck, melanoma, non-small cell lung (NSCLC), ovarian or urothelial cancer.
Endometrial Cancer|Esophageal Cancer|Esophagogastric Junction (EGJ)|Gastric (Stomach) Cancer|Head and Neck Cancer|Melanoma|Ovarian Cancer|Non-small Cell Lung (NSCLC)|Urothelial Cancer
GENETIC: Autologous genetically modified ADP-A2M4CD8 cells alone or in combination with nivolumab every four weeks or pembrolizumab every 6 weeks
To evaluate safety and tolerability of ADP-A2M4CD8 as monotherapy or in combination with either nivolumab or pembrolizumab, Determination of incidence of dose-limiting toxicities, adverse events and tolerable dose, 2.5 years|To evaluate safety of ADP-A2M4CD8 as monotherapy or in combination with either nivolumab or pembrolizumab, Incidence of patients with Replication-competent Retrovirus, persistence of ADP-A2M4CD8 T-cells and incidence of insertional oncogenesis., Up to 15 years
Anti-tumour activity: Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as incidence of complete responses or partial responses as assessed by RECIST v1.1, 2.5 years|Anti-tumor activity: Best overall response (BOR), BOR is per RECIST V1.1., 2.5 years|Time to response (TTR), For patients who are observed to respond to ADP-A2M4CD8 as monotherapy or in combination with either nivolumab or pembrolizumab, the time taken to achieve a partial response or complete response (TTR) is assessed., 2.5 years|Duration of Response (DOR), For patients who are observed to respond to ADP-A2M4CD8 as monotherapy or in combination with either nivolumab or pembrolizumab, the DOR is the date of first response (including confirmation) up until disease progression per RECIST v 1.1 or death, 2.5 years|Duration of stable disease (DoSD), For patients who are observed to have stable disease by RECIST v 1.1, the duration of period of stable disease until disease progression or death, 2.5 years|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is assessed from date of infusion of ADP-A2M4CD8 as monotherapy or in combination with either nivolumab or pembrolizumab up until the date of disease progression per RECIST v1.1 or death., 2.5 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS is assessed from date of infusion of ADP-A2M4CD8 as monotherapy or in combination with either nivolumab or pembrolizumab up until the date of patient death., 15 years
