Consolidation Chemotherapy After Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation for Lymphoid Malignancies
To imporve the outcome of patients with relapsed/refractory lymphoma, we conduct a clinical trial to test the efficacy and feasibility of consolidation chemotherapy after autologous stem cell transplantation
Effects of Chemotherapy
DRUG: Bu-CY-E
progression free survival, 2-year
overall survival, 2-year|progression, PET-CT measurement, 2-year|transplantation-related mortality, 2-year
Patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoma will be included. All patients will undergo PBSC mobilization with CTX and G-CSF. After sucessful collection of CD34+ over 1x109/L, autologous stem cel ltransplantation with Bu-Cy-E conditioning will be given. Two months after auto-HSCT, a PET-CT will be performed and all patients with CR, CRu and PR will recieved 3 cycles of mini-Bu-Cy-E as consolidation 3, 6 and 9 months after auto-HSCT. For patients with SD or PD after auto-HSCT will refered to the allogeneic transplantatio program and take off the study.
