Safety Study of ABT-263 in Combination With Rituximab in Lymphoid Cancers
This is a Phase 1 study evaluating the safety of ABT-263 administered in combination with rituximab in participants with CD20-positive lymphoproliferative disorders. The extension portion of the study will allow active participants to continue to receive ABT-263 for up to 14 years after the last participant transitions with quarterly study evaluations.

DRUG: rituximab|DRUG: ABT-263
Extension Study: Continued assessment of the safety profile of ABT-263 when administered in combination with rituximab, Safety will be assessed until the participant discontinues the extension portion of the study.|Assess the safety profile and characterize the pharmacokinetics of ABT-263 when administered in combination with rituximab, Safety and pharmacokinetics will be assessed until the participant discontinues the study or transitions to the extension portion of the study (whichever comes first).|Determination of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) when ABT-263 is administered in combination with rituximab, DLTs and MTD will be assessed after all participants in a dose level have completed the lead-in period plus 28 days if dosing with ABT-263 and rituximab
Extension Study: Continued assessment of the preliminary progression-free survival (PFS), response rate, and duration of response., PFS will be measured upon study completion via statistical analysis of the study data.|Preliminary progression-free survival (PFS), response rate, and duration of response., PFS will be measured upon study completion via statistical analysis of the study data.
