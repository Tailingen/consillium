PK and Drug Interaction Study of Utidelone Plus Capecitabine in Patients With Advanced Breast Cancer
This trial is an open, multi-center, phase Ic clinical study on the pharmacokinetics and drug interactions of utidelone injection combined with capecitabine in patients with recurrent and metastatic breast cancer.

The purpose of this trial is:

1. To evaluate the pharmacokinetic characteristics of continuous intravenous administration of utidelone.
2. To evaluate the drug interaction of utidelone and capecitabine.
Advanced and Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Utidelone Injection; capecitabine|DRUG: Utidelone
Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax), To measure the maximal plasma concentration of the study drugs and evaluate the pharmacokinetic characteristics of continuous intravenous administration of utidelone, measure PK parameters such as Maximum Plasma Concentration \[Cmax\], 12 weeks|C-T curve, To evaluate the pharmacokinetic interaction of utidelone and capecitabine in patients when administered in combination., 12 weeks|Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), To get area under the plasma concentration versus time curve, 12 weeks
Measure and plot r-t curve, To analyse mass balance, 12 weeks|Incidence of treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, To evaluate the safety of the study, 6 months
