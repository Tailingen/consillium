Improving SUrgery of Liver Metastases: a Trial of the Arterial Chemotherapy Network
National trial, multicenter, randomized, phase II comparing treatment intensification with hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy plus systemic chemotherapy (CT) to systemic chemotherapy alone in patients with liver-only colorectal metastases (CRLM) considered still non resectable after at least two months of systemic induction chemotherapy.
Colorectal Cancer Metastatic
DRUG: Oxaliplatin, Cetuximab, Bevacizumab, Panitumumab, Irinotecan, Leucovorin, 5-Fluorouracil
Curative-intent (R0-R1) resection (and/or ablation) rate (CRR) of CRLM, Curative-intent (R0-R1) resection (and/or ablation) rate (CRR) of CRLM confirmed by a systematic review of the surgical and pathological report by an independent committee blind to the treatment received, 6 months
to compare the efficacy of CT intensification combining hepatic arterial infusion(HAI) oxaliplatin plus IV FOLFIRI plus targeted therapy (anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or bevacizumab) to conventional systemic CT alone plus targeted therapy (anti-EGFR or antiangiogenic antibody), in patients with liver-only CRLM not amenable to curative-intent resection (and/or ablation) after systemic induction CT in terms of conversion to complete (R0 R1) resection (or ablation) rate (CRR).
