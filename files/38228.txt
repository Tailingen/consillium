A Phase II Study of Total Neoadjuvant Therapy for Locally Advanced Gastric Cancer
This prospective, single arm phase II study is designed to evaluate the rate of pathologic complete response of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery for locally advanced gastric adenocarcinoma
Gastric Cancer|Neoadjuvant Therapy
RADIATION: SIB-IMRT|DRUG: S-1|DRUG: SOX|PROCEDURE: Surgery
PCR rate, Pathological response were classified into three grades.Grade I signifies that there is little shrinkage in the tumor; only mild regression in the tumor cells is observed under telemicroscope. Grade II shows gross reduction in size of the tumor and marked regression in the cancer cells microscopically, yet viable nests of cancer tissue are still visible. Grade III implies complete or almost total resolution of the tumor on exploration, and disappearance of the tumor tissue microscopically; only remnants of degenerated cancer cells can be seen (so-called ghost cancer cells)., 6-8 months
Acute chemotherapy/Chemoradiotherapy toxicities, chemotherapy toxicities are evaluated by NCI-CTC version 4.0 and radiotherapy toxicities are graded using the RTOG/EORTC Radiation Morbidity Scoring Schema., 6-8 months|surgery complications, During hospital stay and within the first 30 days after completion of surgery., 6-8 months|Tumor down-staging, Down-staging was considered as any stage reduction between clinical and pathologic stage., 6-8 months|R0 resection rate, The surgical procedure was total or subtotal gastrectomy with recommended D2 lymphadenectomy 4-6 weeks after total neoadjuvant therapy., 6-8 months
