A Study of Alectinib (RO5424802) in Participants With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Who Have Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) Mutation and Failed Crizotinib Treatment
This open-label, non-randomized, multicenter, Phase 1/2 study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of alectinib in participants with non-small cell lung cancer who have ALK mutation and failed crizotinib treatment.
