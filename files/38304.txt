Pediatric-Inspired Chemotherapy Plus Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor in Adult Philadelphia Chromosome-Positive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
This study will combine a standard, pediatric-inspired, chemotherapy regimen with the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) Dasatinib and Ponatinib to treat adults with Philadelphia Chromosome-Positive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.

There are two age groups/cohorts:

* participants aged 18 to 59 years
* participants aged 60 years and older

One tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), either Dasatinib or Ponatinib, will be administered in each of the respective chemotherapy cycles. The TKI (either Dasatinib or Ponatinib) administered in a given cycle of chemotherapy will be dictated by the given cycle's standard chemotherapy, in order to minimize overlapping side effects of the chemotherapy and TKI.

The dosages of the standard chemotherapy agents, as well as the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)--Dasatinib and Ponatinib--have been adjusted for each age group to allow continuous administration of these TKIs.
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
DRUG: Dasatinib|DRUG: Ponatinib|DRUG: Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster Chemotherapy|DRUG: Methotrexate and Cytarabine
Rate of complete molecular remission (CMR) at the end of one cycle of Dasatinib + BFM, CMR will be assessed by minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative status, using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis from bone marrow aspirates, after 1 cycle of induction therapy with Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster (BFM) protocol and Dasatinib., Post day 36; up to day 43
Rate of Adverse Events related to Dasatinib and Ponatinib, Per NCI CTCAE v5.0 toxicity data, specifically:

* for dasatinib: pulmonary hypertension (any grade) or grade ≥ 3 serositis/volume overload.
* for ponatinib: arterial embolism (any grade) and grade ≥ 3 venous thromboembolism, heart failure, or pancreatitis, 30 days after last treatment, up to approximately 3 years|Percentage of participants who begin ponatinib post-induction that complete at least one cycle., Feasibility will be assessed by the percentage, among patients who begin the ponatinib post-induction regimen, that complete at least one cycle. Completion is defined as the ability to tolerate ≥ 80% dose intensity of all prescribed anti-cancer agents per cycle of ponatinib initiated., At 18 weeks|Complete hematologic (morphologic) remission (CHR) rate after induction, Bone marrow assessed by morphologic review of both the aspirate smear and core biopsy, After Remission Induction Phase I and at end of study treatment, up to approximately 3 years|Complete cytogenic remission (CCyR) rate post induction, Bone marrow aspirate assessed by karyotype and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)., After Remission Induction Phase I and at end of study treatment, up to approximately 3 years|Complete molecular remission (CMR) rate, Bone marrow aspirate analyzed by RT-qPCR., After Remission Induction Phase I and at end of study treatment, up to approximately 3 years|Disease-free survival (DFS), Disease-Free Survival (DFS) is defined as the duration of time from attainment of CR (morphologic remission, hematologic remission, etc) to Morphologic Relapse (Relapsed Disease) or Death., up to five years after end of study treatment (approximately 8 years)|Overall survival (OS)., Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the length of time from the date of diagnosis that patients diagnosed with the disease are still alive., up to five years after end of study treatment (approximately 8 years)
