Trial of Olaparib in Patients With Metastatic Urothelial Cancer Harboring DNA Damage Response Gene Alterations
This is a single arm open label multi-institutional phase II trial of olaparib monotherapy in subjects with metastatic urothelial cancer harboring somatic DNA damage response (DDR) alterations. The primary objective of the study is to estimate the objective response rate (per RECIST 1.1) to treatment with olaparib.
Metastatic Urothelial Cancer
DRUG: Olaparib
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST): Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD) \>= 20% increase in tumor burden relative to nadir or the appearance of one or more new lesions; Stable Disease (SD), not meet criteria for CR/PR/PD.

ORR is defined as the proportion of all subjects with confirmed PR or CR according to RECIST 1.1., Up to a maximum of 17 months
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST): Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD) \>= 20% increase in tumor burden relative to nadir or the appearance of one or more new lesions; Stable Disease (SD), not meet criteria for CR/PR/PD. PFS is defined as time from registration until disease progression met by RECIST 1.1 or death from any cause., Time of treatment start until the criteria for disease progression or death. Up to a maximum of 17 months.
Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the time from treatment start until death or date of last contact., Time of treatment start until death or date of last contact, up to a maximum of 23 months.|Adverse Events, Number of participants with treatment related adverse events are reported by CTCAEv4 term and grade., AE had been recorded from time of signed informed consent until 30 days after discontinuation of study drug(s) or until a new anti-cancer treatment starts, whichever occurs first, up to a maximum of 18 months.
