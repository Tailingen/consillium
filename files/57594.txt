Lorlatinib in ALK Inhibitor Treated Unresectable Advanced/Recurrent ALK-Positive Non Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients in India
Lorlatinib is a third-generation, oral, reversible, ATP-competitive, macrocyclic TKI of ALK and ROS1. Lorlatinib was specifically designed to penetrate the CNS and to overcome known secondary resistance mutations in the ALK tyrosine kinase domain.

This is a Phase 4, open-label, multicenter, non-randomized, prospective, single arm study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of lorlatinib in adult participants with unresectable advanced and/or recurrent ALK-positive NSCLC with resistance or intolerance to at least 1 prior ALK inhibitor treatment.

This study is being conducted as a post approval study to fulfill Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) request relating to additional information on use of Lorlatinib in Indian patients.
Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Lorlatinib
Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a product or medical device; the event did not necessarily need to have a causal relationship with the treatment or usage. A TEAE was defined as an event that emerged during treatment, having been absent pretreatment, or worsened relative to the pretreatment state. If the investigator did not know whether or not the investigational product caused the event, then the event would be handled as "related to investigational product" for reporting purposes, as defined by the sponsor. If the investigator's causality assessment was "unknown but not related to investigational product," this was clearly documented on study records., From Day 1 up to 35 days post last dosing date or the date of initiation of a new anticancer therapy (up to 1.9 years)
Confirmed Objective Responses Rate (ORR) Based on Investigator Assessment, ORR was defined as the percentage of participants with best overall response as confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. ORR was provided along with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) based on Wilson's Score Method. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the target lesions., Assessed at least 1 year from first dose or until progression of disease, death or received subsequent anti-cancer therapy, whichever came first up to a maximum of 2 years.|Confirmed Intracranial Objective Response Rate (IC-ORR) Based on Investigator Assessment, IC-ORR was defined as the percentage of participants with intracranial response (ie, best overall intracranial response as confirmed CR or confirmed PR considering only intracranial lesions) relative to participants with central nervous system (CNS) metastases at study entry. IC-ORR was provided along with the corresponding 95% CI based on Wilson's Score Method. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the target lesions., Assessed at least 1 year from first dose or until progression of disease, death or received subsequent anti-cancer therapy, whichever came first up to a maximum of 2 years.|Duration of Response (DoR), DoR was defined as the time from the first documentation of objective tumor response (confirmed CR or confirmed PR) to the first documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. For participants whose responses proceed from PR to CR, the onset of PR was taken as the onset of response. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the target lesions., Assessed at least 1 year from first dose or until progression of disease, death or received subsequent anti-cancer therapy, whichever came first up to a maximum of 2 years.|Intracranial Duration of Response (IC-DoR), IC-DoR was defined as the time from the first documentation of an intracranial objective response (confirmed CR or confirmed PR) to the first documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first in the subgroup of participants with brain metastasis at baseline. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the target lesions., Assessed at least 1 year from first dose or until progression of disease, death or received subsequent anti-cancer therapy, whichever came first up to a maximum of 2 years.
