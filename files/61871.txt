Incidence of Ocular Antibodies in Patients With Sturge - Weber Syndrome (SWS)
Sturge-Weber Syndrome (SWS) is a neurological disorder characterized at birth by seizures and a large port-wine stain birthmark on the forehead and upper eyelid of one side of the face. SWS is also accompanied by an increased pressure within the eye (glaucoma) which can develop very early in life.

Glaucoma represents a group of ocular disorders that are characterized by the loss of retinal ganglion cells and their axons, damage to the optic nerve, and gradual loss of visual field. Recently, several studies provided evidence that there is a potential role of the immune system in the pathogenesis of glaucoma.

These findings suggest that there might be changes in systemic humoral immunity possibly underlying the optic neuropathy in at least some glaucoma patients.

OTHER: blood sample tear drop sample
The ocular antibody profile in patients with SWS is unknown.The researchers want to study on blood and tear drop samples from patients with SWS to determine the incidence of ocular antibodies in patients with this syndrome.
