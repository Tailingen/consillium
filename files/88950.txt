Erector Spinae Plane Block Versus Serratus Plane Block for Breast Surgery
Serratus plane block (SPB) was first described in 2013 by Blanco and designed to primarily block the thoracic intercostal nerves. And this block provides sufficient analgesia lateral anterior and posterior part of thoracic wall.Erector Spinae Plane Block (ESPB) is a newly described and effective interfascial plane block for thoracic and abdominal surgery. It was first described by Forero et al. in 2016, effectiveness being reported in four cases. The aim of this study is to compare Serratus plane block and erector spinae plane block on postoperative pain in patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection
