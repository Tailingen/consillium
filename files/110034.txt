Study of Low-Dose Radiotherapy (LDRT) Concurrent Cisplatin/Carboplatin Plus Etoposide With Atezolizumab for Patients With Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a Phase II, single arm, multicenter study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of low-dose radiotherapy (LDRT) concurrent cisplatin/carboplatin plus etoposide with atezolizumab in participants who have extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) and are chemotherapy-navïe for their extensive-stage disease.

DRUG: Atezolizumab|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Etoposide|RADIATION: Thoracic radiation therapy (TRT)
Objective Response Rate, Objective response rate (ORR), defined as the proportion of participants with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) on two consecutive occasions \>= 4 weeks apart, as determined by the investigator according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1)., Baseline up to approximately 36 months
Duration of Response, Duration of response (DOR), defined as the time from the first occurrence of a documented objective response to disease progression or death from any cause (whichever occurs first), as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1., Baseline to disease progression or death from any cause (whichever occurs first)(up to approximately 36 months)|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Disease control rate (DCR), defined as the proportion of participants who have a best overall response of CR or PR or stable disease (SD), as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1., Baseline up to approximately 36 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression Free Survival (PFS), defined as the time from initiation of study treatment to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause (whichever occurs first), as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1., Baseline to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause (whichever occurs first) (up to approximately 36 months)|PFS Rate at 6 Months and 1 Year, PFS rate at 6 months and 1 year, defined as the proportion of patients who have not experienced disease progression or death from any cause at 6 months and 1 year separately, as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1., Baseline up to 1 year|Overall Survival (OS), OS, defined as the time from initiation of study treatment to death from any cause., Baseline until death (up to approximately 36 months)|OS Rate at 1 Year and 2 Years, OS rate at 1 year and 2 years, defined as the proportion of patients who have not experienced death from any cause at 1 year and 2 years., Baseline to 2 years or death, whichever occurs first.|Percentage of Participants With Adverse Event, Baseline up to approximately 36 months
