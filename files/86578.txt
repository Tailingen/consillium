Noninvasive Assessment of Lymphedema Among Breast Cancer Survivors
This proof of concept study will evaluate the ability of a new, ultrasound based technology called Bullseye Constructive Shearwave Interference (CSI) (trade name, Bullseye Elasticity Quantification) to measure lymphedema of the upper arm among breast cancer survivors.

The study's hypothesis is that the CSI device can detect the presence of clinically significant lymphedema when compared with the standard arm tape measurement.
Lymphedema of Upper Arm|Breast Cancer
DEVICE: Constructive Shearwave Interference (CSI)
Difference in mean shear wave speed across sites measured between lymphedema and non-lymphedema limbs, differences in shear wave speed (Bullseye) device measurements between lymphedema affected and non-affected contralateral limb, baseline
