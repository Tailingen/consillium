Study Evaluating MST-997 in Advanced Malignant Solid Tumors
MST-997 is a taxane analog with the potential to treat subjects with a variety of tumor types. Preclinical data demonstrated that MST-997 inhibited tumor growth when administered intravenously (IV). This phase 1 dose escalation study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of if IV MST-997 formulated in Polysorbate 80 Diluent can be safely administered on a weekly basis.
