A Two-part Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Efficacy of KRP203 in Patients Undergoing Stem Cell Transplant for Hematological Malignancies
Two part study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy (in Part 2 only) of KRP203 in patients undergoing allogeneic hemopoietic stem cell transplant for hematological malignancies
Hematological Malignancies
DRUG: Study Part 1: KRP203|DRUG: Study Part 2: KRP203 lower dose|DRUG: Study Part 2: KRP203 higher dose
Number of participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of safety, Safety and tolerability of KRP203 in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoetic stem cell transplant for hematological malignancies, 111 days
Plasma Pharmacokinetics of KRP203: Area under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve (AUC), The main PK parameters will be determined in whole blood using non-compartmental methods. Pk parameters being measured are: AUCtau AUC during a dosing interval (tau) of 24 hours \[h.ng/mL\] , AUCtauR Molar ratios between KRP203-P and KRP203 based on Cmax or AUCtau, 111 days|Plasma Pharmacokinetics (PK) of KRP203: Observed Maximum Plasma Concentration Following Drug Administration (Cmax), Cmax Maximum (peak) blood drug concentration after drug administration \[ng/mL\], 111 days|Plasma Pharmacokinetics (PK) of KRP203: Time to reach the maximum concentration after drug administration, Tmax Time to reach maximum (peak) concentration \[ng/mL\], 111 days|GVHD-free, relapse free survival, occurence of GVHD, disease relaps and death will be assessed, 1 years post-transplant|GVHD-free, relapse free survival, occurence of GVHD, disease relaps and death will be assessed, 2 years post transplant
