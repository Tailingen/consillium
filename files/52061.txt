Ocular Conservative Treatment for Retinoblastoma : Efficacy of the New Management Strategies and Visual Outcome
This protocol includes 2 independent studies. Both studies are multicenter studies, evaluating different therapeutic approaches in two different populations of patients:

* Study 1, a randomized phase-II study evaluating the efficacy of Intra-Arterial Chemotherapy (IAC) with melphalan and topotecan versus melphalan alone, both in association with ophthalmologic treatments.
* Study 2, a minimally invasive interventional study evaluating the results on visual function following reference treatment with intravenous (IV) chemotherapy in association with ophthalmologic or local ophthalmological treatment without IV chemotherapy.
Retinoblastoma
DRUG: Melphalan or Melphalan + Topotecan|DRUG: etoposide, carboplatin and vincristine or local ophthalmological treatment without IV chemotherapy|DRUG: Carboplatin administered on Day 1|DEVICE: Thermotherapy (local treatment)|DEVICE: Cryotherapy (local treatment)|DEVICE: Iodine-125 plaques (local treatment)|DRUG: Intravitreal Melphalan chemotherapy injections (local treatment)
Study 1: Rate of eye preservation, Rate of eye preservation in the 2 treatments' arms, 24 months after randomization|Visual function, Percentage of patients with major, mild or no impairment of visual function according to WHO criteria, i.e. normal bilateral visual acuity (≥ 6/10) or mild bilateral visual impairment (3/10 to 5/10) according to tumor location and extension, when patient is 6 years old and at least 24 months of follow-up after study inclusion
Ocular toxicity, Percentage of patients with at least one grade-3 or -4 toxicity (CTCAE v. 5.0), Up to 24 months after inclusion in the study|Systemic toxicity, Rate of specific grade 3-4 toxicity (CTCAE v. 5.0), Up to 24 months after inclusion in the study|Relapse, Percentage of patients with relapse within 24 months after inclusion, broken down into: Local relapse, Extra-ocular relapse, within 24 months after inclusion|Second malignant tumor, Percentage of patients with second malignant tumor within 24 months after study inclusion, 24 months after study inclusion|Additional assessment of visual function, Additional assessment of visual function at follow-up: Percentage of patients at each of the four levels of visual acuity according to WHO criteria, In the year patients turn 6 years of age and at least 24 months of treatment|Retinal assessment, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Optical Coherence Tomography-Angiography (OCT-A) measures on retina, In the year patients turn 6 years of age and at least 24 months of treatment|Integration at school, Rate of children able to attend the common primary school : without specific help or with the help of a dedicated person and/or with specific features to facilitate reading and writing, In the year patients turn 6 years of age and at least 24 months of treatment
Primary objective of the studies:

* Study 1: To evaluate the efficacy of IAC in term of local control of the disease in patients eligible for IAC (randomized phase II study);
* Study 2: To assess the visual function, based on World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, in patients eligible for other conservative treatments (IV chemotherapy in association with local ophthalmologic trématent or local ophthalmological treatment without IV chemotherapy; this is a minimally invasive interventional study).
