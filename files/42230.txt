Targeted Therapy With Gefitinib in Patients With USP8-mutated Cushing's Disease
The USP8 gene and its downstream target, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), is a potential therapeutic target of Cushing disease. The EGFR inhibitor, Gefitinib, has been shown to reduce the production of ACTH both in vitro and in vivo, especially in USP8-mutated corticotrophin adenomas. The investigators hypothesize that Gefitinib will suppress pituitary corticotroph tumor ACTH production and normalize urinary free cortisol levels in patients with USP8-mutated Cushing's disease. Gefitinib is an FDA approved drug used to treat non-small cell lung cancer. However, in this study, the drug will be used to treat corticotrophin adenoma.

Change in levels of 24 hour urinary free cortisol after 4 weeks, Full response is defined as the reduction of 24 hour urinary free cortisol more than 50% or normalized. Partial response is defined as the reduction of 24 hour urinary free cortisol between 25%\~ 50%. Poor response or resistance is defined as the reduction of 24 hour urinary free cortisol less than 25%., Baseline, Week 4
