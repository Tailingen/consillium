Olutasidenib, Venetoclax, and Azacitidine in IDH1 Mutated Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia Patients Eligible for Intensive Induction Chemotherapy
The purpose of this study is as follows:

1. Determine whether people receiving the combination treatment of olutasidenib, venetoclax, and azacitidine have the same, more, or fewer side effects compared to the usual chemotherapy treatment that people with this condition receive.
2. Determine how well the combination treatment of olutasidenib, venetoclax, and azacitidine works compared to the usual chemotherapy treatment that people with this condition receive.

Duration of CR is defined as time in months from CRc is first achieved until relapse, death, or off-study for other acute myeloid leukemia (AML) therapy., Up to 12 months|Time to Composite Complete Remission (CRc), Time to composite complete remission (CRc) among participants will be reported in months. Time to CRc is defined is the period from Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1) to the date CRc is first achieved., Up to 12 months|Percentage of Participants Receiving Allogeneic HCST, The percentage of participants receiving allogenic stem cell transplant (HCST), over the duration of study treatment will be reported., Up to 12 months|Percentage of Participants Achieving Complete Response (CR), The percentage of study participants achieving complete response (CR) to study treatment will be reported. Response will be assessed using on modified 2022 European LeukemiaNet (ELN) criteria for AML., Up to 12 months|Overall Response Rate, Overall response rate (ORR) (reported as a percentage), which includes complete remission (CR), complete remission with partial hematologic recovery (CRh), complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi), morphologic leukemia free state (MLFS), and partial response (PR) over the duration of study treatment, as defined by modified 2022 European LeukemiaNet (ELN) criteria., Up to 12 months|Duration of response (DOR), Duration of response (DOR) over the duration of study treatment will be reported. The DOR is defined as the number of days from the date of initial response to the date of first documented disease progression/relapse or death, whichever occurs first., Up to 12 months|Time to Response (TTR), Time to response (TTR) over the duration of study treatment will be reported in months. TTR is defined as the elapsed time from Cycle 1 Day 1 until complete remission (CR), complete remission with partial hematologic recovery (CRh), complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi), morphologic leukemia free state (MLFS), or partial response (PR) is first achieved., Up to 12 months|Event-free survival (EFS), Event-free survival (EFS) among study participants over the duration of study treatment will be reported. EFS is defined as time in months from the date of treatment initiation (i.e., C1D1) to the date of documented treatment failure, relapse, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, and will be calculated for all participants., Up to 12 months|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the elapsed time in months from the start of treatment until death from any cause. Alive participants will be censored at the last date known to be alive., Up to 36 months|Minimal residual disease (MRD) negative rates, Minimal residual disease (MRD) negative rates as assessed by multi-parameter flow cytometry (MPFC) and/or next generation sequencing (NGS)/polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based technology performed locally, will be reported as a percentage over the duration of study treatment., Up to 12 months|Pharmacokinetics (PK): Cmax, Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) among study participants will be reported via the collection and analysis of blood samples.
