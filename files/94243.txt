Cryoablation of Bone Metastases From Endocrine Tumors
This study will evaluate the clinical response and safety of cone beam computed-tomography guided percutaneous cryoablation in bone metastases from thyroid, adrenal and neuroendocrine tumors in 30 patients.

Thyroid neoplasms, as well as adrenal and neuroendocrine tumors have the potential to metastasize to bone. About 3% of patients with well-differentiated thyroid carcinomas develop secondary bone lesions, while adrenal and neuroendocrine tumors have 10% and 13% bone metastases rates, respectively. Spinal metastases are associated to a worst prognosis. The progressive systemic disease, the post-operative complications, and the pre-operative neurologic impairment were associated to a worst global survival rate in the thyroid cancer. Additionally, extensive spinal instrumentation of metastatic thyroid carcinoma was associated to greater complication rates. Interventional radiology offers promising techniques for the minimally invasive approach of bone metastases. Image-guided percutaneous radiofrequency ablation and cryoablation techniques have been studied in clinical trials and are considered effective options in pain palliation of patients with bone metastatic disease. These techniques may be associated with conventional treatment, as well as radiation therapy and percutaneous embolization, avoiding major surgical interventions and its complications.
