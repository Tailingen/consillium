Biobehavioral-Cytokine Interactions in Ovarian Cancer
The purpose of this study is to understand relationships between behavioral factors, hormones, and chemicals produced by the body that may help tumor growth in ovarian cancer.

Ovarian cancer is the second most common gynecologic cancer. Because of low rates of survival for the majority of ovarian cancer patients, identification of factors contributing to tumor progression is of paramount importance. Epidemiologic studies have suggested an association between biobehavioral factors such as life stress, depression, low social support and cancer progression. Direct links have been demonstrated between biobehavioral factors and cytokines supporting angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels that enhance tumor growth and progression. However, little is known regarding tumor associated macrophages (TAM) and interactions between TAM tumor cells in a way that favors tumor growth, but there is preliminary data indicating that ovarian cancer patients with higher levels of depressive symptoms and life stress have greater TAM production of matrix metalloproteinase-9, a key molecule promoting angiogenesis and tumor invasion. We also have preliminary data that ovarian cancer patients with high levels of depressive symptoms accompanied by low social support have greater tumor expression of a number of genes related to inflammation and tumor progression.
