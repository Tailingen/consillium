Evaluation of a Multi-phosphopeptide Vaccine Plus PolyICLC in Participants With High Risk and Advanced Malignancies
The purpose of this study is to learn what effects (good and bad) experimental phosphopeptide vaccines plus a tetanus peptide and other substances called polyICLC and Montanide ISA-51 have on people with melanoma. The investigators will also look at whether the experimental reagents cause any changes in the immune system.
Melanoma
BIOLOGICAL: pBCAR3-phosphopeptide|BIOLOGICAL: pIRS2-phosphopeptide|BIOLOGICAL: 2-MpP (pBCAR3-phosphopeptide + pIRS2-phosphopeptide)
Safety, Adverse events occurring in each subject will be reported until 30 days post administration of the last vaccine., 30 days post administration of the last vaccine
Immunogenicity of phosphopeptide vaccines, Evaluation of immunogenicity will be measured by immune response to the phosphopeptides by ELIspot assay of PBL., Through Day 85
