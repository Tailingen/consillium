A Trial With Metronomic Low-dose Treosulfan, Pioglitazone and Clarithromycin Versus Standard Treatment in NSCLC
This is a Phase II, multicentre, open-label, randomized, and controlled study, evaluating the efficacy and safety of combined modularized treatment of treosulfan, pioglitazone and clarithromycin in patients with with squamous and non- squamous cell lung cancer, respectively after platin failure.
Squamous Cell Lung Cancer|Non-Squamous Cell Lung Cancer|Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Pioglitazone|DRUG: nivolumab|DRUG: Treosulfan|DRUG: Clarithromycin
Progression Free Survival, up to 6 months after study completion
Overall Survival, up to 6 months after study completion|Duration of Response, up to 6 months after study completion|Number of participants experiencing adverse events related to the study drugs, Safety and Tolerability assessments will include the incidence, nature, and severity of adverse events and laboratory abnormalities graded per the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE v4.0). Laboratory safety assessments will include, but are not limited to, the regular monitoring of hematology and blood chemistry, up to 6 months after study completion|Number of participants experiencing a change in cellular secretome analytics in serum, To measure the effect on inflammation, angiogenesis and immune response (proteomics, lipidomics) on serum samples, at screening, at the beginning of each new treatment cycle (each cycle consists of 28 days) and at the end of treatment visit, which will take place within 3 weeks of the last intake of study drug|proportion of patients who report a considerable degree of impairment in a respective dimension, i.e. a score value <50, evaluate and compare patient reported outcomes (PROs) of lung cancer symptoms and patient functioning between treatment arms, up to 6 months after study completion|proportion of patients who report a considerable degree of impairment in a respective dimension, i.e. a score value <50, evaluate and compare health-related quality of life (HRQoL) between treatment arms, up to 6 months after study completion|Comparison of participants tumour response according to (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) RECIST criteria version 1.1 and Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) expression, tissue microarray for analysis of PPAR-γ expression for each tumour sample will be performed., Baseline|description of change in predictive and prognostic exploratory biomarkers for each participant, For patients participating in University Clinic Regensburg only: Secretome analytics (proteomics, lipidomics) will be performed to monitor functions of tumor-associated cellular compartments on serum samples. Serum samples are taken at the beginning of each new treatment cycle. epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), K-ras, Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), and Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) will be analyzed., at screening,at the beginning of each treatment cycle (each treatment cycle consists of 28 days), and at the end of treatment visit, which will take place within 3 weeks of the last intake of study drug
Patients will be randomized 1:1, and will be stratified according to histology (squamous cell carcinoma vs adenocarcinoma).

86 patients with platin refractory Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) will be treated either with metronomic low-dose treosulfan, pioglitazone and clarithromycin (experimental arm) or with nivolumab (squamous cell lung cancer and nonsquamous cell lung cancer).

Patients will undergo tumor assessments at baseline and every 6 weeks (approximately every two cycles) thereafter, until progression. Patients without progression after 36 weeks will undergo tumor assessments every 12 weeks.
