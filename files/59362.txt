Evaluate Durvalumab and Tremelimumab +/- Lenvatinib in Combination With TACE in Patients With Locoregional HCC
A global study to evaluate transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in combination with durvalumab, tremelimumab and lenvatinib therapy in patients with locoregional hepatocellular carcinoma
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: Tremelimumab|DRUG: Durvalumab|PROCEDURE: Transarterial Chemoembolization (TACE)|DRUG: Lenvatinib
Progression Free Survival (PFS) for Arm A vs Arm C, PFS is defined as time from randomization until progression per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR or death due to any cause, Approximately 5 years
Overall Survival (OS) for Arm A vs Arm C, OS is defined as the time from the date of randomization until death due to any cause, Approximately 5 years|Progression Free Survival (PFS) for Arm B vs Arm C, PFS is defined as time from randomization until progression per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR or death due to any cause, Approximately 5 years|Overall Survival (OS) for Arm B vs Arm C, OS is defined as the time from the date of randomization until death due to any cause, Approximately 5 years
This is a Phase III, parallel, randomized, open-label, sponsor-blinded, 3-arm, multicenter, international study assessing the efficacy and safety of durvalumab + tremelimumab + TACE with or without lenvatinib compared with TACE alone in participants with locoregional HCC not amenable to curative therapy (eg, surgical resection, transplantation, or ablation).
