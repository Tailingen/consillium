Padeliporfin VTP Using Robotic Assisted Bronchoscopy in Peripheral Lung Cancer
Phase 1/1b, safety, feasibility, and light dose titration study followed by further study of therapeutic ablation effects.

Patients with high risk of peripheral primary lung cancer, stage 1A1/1A2, for whom surgical treatment is planned, will be recruited. Surgery will be performed at 5-21 days following the VTP procedure.

Study intervention: robotic assisted bronchoscopic Padeliporfin VTP lung ablation: vascular targeted photodynamic therapy using Padeliporfin photosensitizer.

A multicenter, open label, phase 1/1b, safety, feasibility, and light dose titration study followed by further study of therapeutic ablation effects.

Patients with high risk of peripheral primary lung cancer, stage 1A1/1A2, for whom surgical treatment is planned, will be recruited. Patients who are candidates for lung resection will be recruited as a diagnose and treat in the same anaesthesia, protocol; surgery will be performed at least 5 days and up to 21 days following the VTP procedure.

Study intervention will consist of robotic assisted bronchoscopic Padeliporfin VTP lung ablation: vascular targeted photodynamic therapy using Padeliporfin photosensitizer, an ablation mechanism with efficacy related to immune response post-ablation.
