This open label Phase 1 multicenter study was designed to evaluate the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of SAR442720 in combination with pembrolizumab in participants with solid tumors in Part 1.

In Part 2, in the expansion cohort (Cohort A) we assessed the antitumor activity and safety of SAR442720 combined with pembrolizumab in participants with metastatic 1L lung cancer.

In Part 3, we evaluated the safety, MTD, RP2D and antitumor activity of SAR442720 in combination with adagrasib in participants with lung cancer and KRAS G12C mutation.

In Part 4, we evaluated the impact of the formulations (formulation 1 and formulation 2) and of the food on the PK of SAR442720 when dosed in combination with pembrolizumab. The expected duration of study intervention for participants may vary, based on progression date; median expected duration of study per participant was estimated to be about 10 months in Part 1, Part 3 and Part 4 (up to 1 month for screening, a median of 6 months for treatment, and a median of 3 months for long term follow-up) and in Part 2 16 months (up to 1 month for screening, a median of 12 months for treatment and a median of 3 months for long term follow up.)
