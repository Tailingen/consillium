First in Human Study of the Infusion of ARI0003 Cells in Relapsed/Refractory to Treatment B-cell Aggressive Lymphoma
ths study consist in testing a CAR T therapy (ARI0003 cells (antiCD19 and antiBCMA) in patients suffering relapsed NHL (that means that symptoms of NHL reappeared ) or refractory (that means that they did not respond to other treatments). This is a first in human study.
Refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma|Relapsed Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
GENETIC: ARI0003
Rate of > grade 3 CRS and/or ICANS, Rate of patients who develop grade \> 3 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and/or grade \> 3 immune cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) according to the criteria and grading defined in the international consensus document of the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT criteria). ASTCT score can be between 1 and 4 (being 1 the minimum value and 4 the maximum) and where higher score means worse outcome., in the first 30 days after ARI0003 administration|ORR, Overall response rate (ORR) according to Lugano criteria (best response within 3 months post ARI0003 infusion, within 3 months post ARI0003 infusion
Procedure-related mortality (PRM), Procedure-related mortality (PRM), defined as any death not directly cause by the lymphoma that is related with the procedure. For the estimation of PRM, disease relapse will be considered as a competing event, through study completion, an average of 24 months|Toxicity: incidence of AE, Toxicity defined as the incidence of grade \>3 adverse events (AEs) as per CTCAE version 5.0. The following AEs will be considered AEs of special interest (AESI): CRS, ICANS, macrophagic activation syndrome (MAS), tumour lysis syndrome (TLS), prolonged cytopenia (beyond 6 months), infections and second primary malignancies, at 3 and 12 months|Complete response rate, Complete response rate, at 3 months|Duration of response,, Duration of response, calculated from the time of first disease evaluation (3 months);, from month 3 to study completion, an average of 24 months|Progression-free survival, Progression-free survival, calculated from ARI-0003 cell infusion, through study completion, an average of 24 months|Overall survival, Overall survival, calculated from ARI-0003 cell infusion, through study completion, an average of 24 months
