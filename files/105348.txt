Abscopal Effect of Radiotherapy and Nivolumab in Relapsed Hodgkin Lymphoma After Anti-PD1 Therapy
The aim of the trial is to improve efficacy of nivolumab in patients with relapsed or refractory HL who recently progressed on anti-PD1 therapy. Nivolumab is highly effective and well tolerated in rrHL, nevertheless CR-rates are low and a considerable proportion of patients suffers from progressive disease. Localized RT induces an immunogenic effect which might work synergistically and facilitate augmented systemic (i.e. abscopal) responses in combination with nivolumab.
Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma
OTHER: Nivolumab plus radiotherapy
Abscopal response rate (ARR-6), Abscopal response rate (ARR-6) with abscopal response centrally confirmed as restaging result after RT to a single lesion and at least four but not more than six nivolumab infusions (RE-6 result), 12 weeks
