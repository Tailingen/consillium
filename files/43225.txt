Neoadjuvant Adebrelimab and Chemotherapy in High-rish ER+/HER2- BC
Investigators plan to conduct a single-arm clinical study of adebelimab, a novel PD-L1 inhibitor, in the neoadjuvant treatment of early or locally advanced high-risk ER+/HER2- breast cancer, to explore whether the addition of immune checkpoint inhibitors to traditional neoadjuvant chemotherapy can improve the pathologic complete response rate (pCR) of patients, evaluate its therapeutic safety, and further analyze the biomarkers of the efficacy of neoadjuvant immunotherapy for ER+/HER2- breast cancer, so as to support the clinical application of the drug.
Breast Cancer
