A Study of GDC-0853 in Patients With Resistant B-Cell Lymphoma or Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.
This open-label, Phase I study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of increasing doses of GDC-0853 in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In a dose-expansion part, GDC-0853 will be assessed in subsets of patients.
