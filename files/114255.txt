En-bloc vs Conventional Resection of Primary Bladder Tumor
Based on current evidence, we hypothesize that eTURB represents an improvement in the surgical management of NMIBC. The resection is more precise and complete compared to cTURB. Moreover, the quality of an en-bloc specimen, including the tumor with its adjacent bladder wall layers, allows an accurate pathological review which leads to correct risk allocation and therapy.

To answer these questions, we designed a RCT comparing eTURB with cTURB. Primary outcome of our study will be the accuracy of pathological staging assessment measured by the presence of detrusor muscle in the specimen as a surrogate parameter for quality of resection.

DEVICE: En-Bloc TURB|DEVICE: Conventional TURB
The pathological staging assessment for eTURB compared to cTURB, The primary objective of the study is to assess whether eBLOC is associated with a higher rate of detrusor muscle in the pathologic specimen, compared to cTURB, 4 weeks
