Sorafenib in Combination With RAD001 in Advanced Solid Tumors Selected on Molecular Targets
Sorafenib is an oral multikinase inhibitor and among its targets are several RTKs involved in tumor genesis (Raf, Flt-3, c-Kit and RET) and angiogenesis (VEGFR1, 2 and 3 and PDGFRß). Therefore sorafenib inhibits tumor growth by a dual mechanism, acting either directly on the tumor (through inhibition of Raf and Kit signaling) and/or on tumor angiogenesis (through inhibition of VEGFR and PDGFR signaling.

RAD001 is a novel derivative of rapamycin. It selectively inhibits mTOR directly blocking tumor cells by preventing tumor cell growth and proliferation and indirectly by inhibiting angiogenesis (via potent inhibition of the HIF-1 and consequently VEGF production).

Targeting mTOR in combination with sorafenib might lead to more profound effects on tumor cell biology than could be achieved through individual targeting of some proteins.

New drugs have often met only limited success since not always target pathways responsible for tumor development and growth are targeted. To overcome this problem, the specific pathways targeted by the investigators two drugs will be analyzed in each single patient before the inclusion.
