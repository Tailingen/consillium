A Study of Subcutaneous Nivolumab Versus Intravenous Nivolumab in Participants With Previously Treated Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma That is Advanced or Has Spread
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the drug levels, efficacy, safety, and tolerability of subcutaneous nivolumab versus intravenous nivolumab in participants with previously treated clear cell renal cell carcinoma that is advanced or has spread. The purpose of this study's substudy is to evaluate drug level biocomparability of subcutaneous nivolumab manufactured using two different manufacturing processes.
