Nordihydroguaiaretic Acid in Treating Patients With Nonmetastatic Relapsed Prostate Cancer
RATIONALE: Nordihydroguaiaretic acid may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of nordihydroguaiaretic acid in treating patients with nonmetastatic relapsed prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: masoprocol
Dose-limiting toxicity as measured by CTC v3.0
Maximum tolerated dose|Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at baseline and on day 1 of each course
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine the maximum tolerated dose of nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) in patients with nonmetastatic, biochemically relapsed prostate cancer.

Secondary

* Determine prostate-specific antigen-modulating effects of NDGA in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

Patients receive oral nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) twice daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of NDGA until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
