Phase 1 Study of Fusilev to Prevent or Reduce Mucositis in Patients With Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma Receiving Folotyn
The purpose of this study is determine the optimal dose and schedule of Fusilev to prevent or reduce Mucositis in patients with Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma receiving Folotyn treatment.
Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma
DRUG: Fusilev|DRUG: Folotyn
Optimal dose and schedule of Fusilev to prevent or reduce mucositis, The patient will be seen in the clinic for an oral mucositis assessment at baseline. During the 6 weeks of Folotyn treatment, oral mucositis assessment will be performed weekly prior to each Folotyn dose and again on Day 4 (prior to the Fusilev dose when applicable) by a qualified health care professional. Patients will complete an Oral Mucositis Daily Questionnaire (OMQD) starting at Day 1 of Week 1 and ending at the End of Treatment Visit., Up to 8 weeks
Impact of Fusilev on Folotyn related Oral Mucositis, To determine the impact of Fusilev on the number of Folotyn-related dose modifications secondary to oral mucositis To determine the impact of Fusilev on the frequency of Folotyn-related oral mucositis To determine the impact of Fusilev on the number of Folotyn doses delivered, 7 weeks|Relationship between Fusilev use and oral mucositis, To determine the relationship between Fusilev use and oral mucositis as a function of the pretreatment homocysteine (HCY) and methylmalonic acid (MMA) levels, 7 weeks
Overall Response Rate (ORR), To determine overall response rate (ORR) of Folotyn in relapsed or refractory Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma other than PTCL, Up to 24 months
This is an open label, uncontrolled, nonrandomized, multicenter, dose finding, Phase 1 study primarily to determine the optimal dose and schedule of Fusilev to prevent or reduce Folotyn-related Grade 3 or higher oral Mucositis.
