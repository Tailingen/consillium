Umbilical Cord Blood Transplantation Using a Myeloablative Preparative Regimen for Hematological Diseases
This is a treatment guideline for an unrelated umbilical cord blood transplant (UCBT) using a myeloablative preparative regimen for the treatment of hematological diseases, including, but not limited to acute leukemias. The myeloablative preparative regimen will consist of cyclophosphamide (CY), fludarabine (FLU) and fractionated total body irradiation (TBI).

This is a study to collect routine clinical data from UCBT using unrelated single or double UCB units as an alternative, non-HLA-matched stem cell source for patients with hematological diseases.

* data collection from transplant preparative therapy consisting of treatments with chemotherapeutic regimens and total body irradiation.
* data collection from umbilical cord blood selection and infusion.
* data collection from standard supportive disease and transplant related care.

Pre- and post-transplant medication, UCB selection and infusion, supportive care, and follow-up will be according to the current University of Minnesota BMT guidelines.

An average of 18 patients are expected to be treated on this protocol per year.
