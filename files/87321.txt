Treatment With Pyrotinib-Based Therapy in Lapatinib Resistant HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer
This is a multicenter, observational, single-arm real world study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pyrotinib after lapatinib progression.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Pyrotinib
Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods is defined as the time from the date of informed consent to the earlier of death or disease progression. Patients alive without disease progression are censored at the date of last disease evaluation. Progressive disease (PD) based on RECIST 1.1 is at least a 20% increase in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. Equivocal progression of non-target lesions also qualifies as PD., 2 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR), The overall response rate is defined as the percentage of patients with a best overall response of CR or PR relative to the appropriate analysis set, 2 years
The Number of Participants Who Experienced Adverse Events (AE), Safety will be assessed by standard clinical and laboratory tests (haematology, serum chemistry). AE grade were defined by the NCI CTCAE (National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events)., 2 years
HER2-positive breast cancers account for 15%-20% of all breast cancers. The development of HER2 targeted therapies have greatly improved the survival of HER2-positive breast cancer patients. Lapatinib has shown effectiveness in treating HER2-positive metastatic breast cancers, but therapies after lapatinib progression are still controversial. This study is aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pyrotinib after lapatinib progression.
