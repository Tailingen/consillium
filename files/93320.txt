Volasertib in Japanese Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
To investigate safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose of volasertib in Japanese patients with AML
Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute
DRUG: Volasertib
Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT) in Cycle 1 for the Determination of the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Volasertib, Primary objective for this trial was to identify the MTD of volasertib. The MTD was defined as the highest dose level at which DLTs were reported in at most 2 in 6 evaluable patients during cycle 1. In this outcome measure the number of participants with DLTs in cycle 1 is presented., From first administration of trial drug up to 28 days|MTD of Volasertib, Primary objective for this trial was to identify the MTD of volasertib. The MTD was defined as the highest dose level at which DLTs were reported in at most 2 in 6 evaluable patients during cycle 1. In this outcome measure the MTD is presented., From first administration of trial drug up to 28 days
Best Response by Complete Remission (CR), The secondary outcome best response will be presented by the CR, CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) and partial remission (PR).

In this outcome measure the CR will be presented.

The criteria for the CR are:

Bone marrow blasts less than 5%; absence of blasts with Auer rods; absence of extramedullary disease; absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \>1.0 × 10\^9/Litre (L) (1000/microlitre (μL)); platelet count \>100 × 10\^9/L (100 000/μL); independence of red cell transfusions., From first administration of trial drug up to 486 days|Best Response by CRi, The secondary outcome best response will be presented by the CR, CRi and PR. In this outcome measure the CRi will be presented.

The criteria for the CRi are:

All CR criteria are met except for residual neutropenia (\<1.0 × 10\^9/L \[1000/μL\]) or thrombocytopenia (\<100 × 10\^9/L \[100 000/μL\])., From first administration of trial drug up to 486 days|Best Response by PR, The secondary outcome best response will be presented by the CR, CRi and PR. In this outcome measure the PR is presented.

The criteria for the PR are:

All haematologic criteria of CR; decrease of bone marrow blast percentage to 5% to 25%; and decrease of pretreatment bone marrow blast percentage by at least 50%., From first administration of trial drug up to 486 days|Remission Duration, The remission duration is the time from the date of achieving CR or CRi until relapse for patients with documented CR or CRi., From first administration of trial drug up to 486 days
