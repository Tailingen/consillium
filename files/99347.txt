Evaluation of 18F-DCFPyL PSMA- Versus 18F-NaF-PET Imaging for Detection of Metastatic Prostate Cancer.
The objective of this study is to evaluate a radiolabeled urea-based small molecule inhibitor of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), \[18F\]DCFPyL (DCFPyL) PET/CT (or PET/MRI imaging if available) for detection of metastatic prostate cancer. PSMA is a well characterized histological marker of prostate cancer tumor aggressiveness and metastatic potential. Preliminary first-in-human studies demonstrate high specific uptake of a first generation less avid compound, DCFBC, in metastatic prostate cancer and demonstrated feasibility for prostate cancer metastatic detection. Investigators propose to assess the ability of DCFPyL PET to detect metastatic prostate cancer by visual qualitative and quantitative SUV analysis. Correlation will be made to sites of suspected metastatic disease detected by ultra sensitive but less specific \[18F\]Sodium Fluoride (NaF)-PET/CT imaging for prostate cancer.
Metastatic Prostate Cancer
DRUG: 18F-DCFPyL Injection|DRUG: 18F-NaF
Comparison of DCFPyL- PET/CT (or PET/MRI imaging) to NaF-PET/CT, Compare the diagnostic accuracy during visit 2 18F-DCFPyL imaging and visit 3 NaF imaging, 4 years
Estimation of new or progressive metastatic lesions found on NaF and 18F-DCFPyL, Compare proportion of new or progressive metastatic lesions found on NaF-PET/CT that are DCFPyL- PET/CT (or PET/MRI imaging if available) positive, and vice-versa., 4 years
