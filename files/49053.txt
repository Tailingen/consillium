Tissue Sample Collection from Patients with Head and Neck Cancer and from Healthy Participants
RATIONALE: Collecting and storing samples of tissue, saliva, and blood from patients with cancer and from healthy participants to study in the laboratory may help the study of cancer in the future.

PURPOSE: This research study is collecting and storing tissue samples from patients with head and neck cancer and from healthy participants.
Head and Neck Cancer
OTHER: biologic sample preservation procedure|OTHER: medical chart review
Maintenance of a clinical database pertaining to diagnosis and treatment outcome of patients with head and neck cancer, Collection of data for both groups from the Vanderbilt Otolaryngology Patient Intake questionnaire as well as the medical record, such as medical history, family history, and exposures to risk factors for cancer (tobacco and alcohol use), and results of tests related to diagnosis of tumor and treatment response (for tumor patients only)., ongoing|Development of a repository of biospecimens, Collection of blood, tissue, saliva, bronchial washings and other specimens as indicated from both tumor and healthy patients., ongoing
OBJECTIVES:

* Maintain and update a clinical database pertaining to diagnosis and treatment outcome of patients with head and neck cancer.
* Develop a repository of biospecimens from these patients.

OUTLINE: Tumor tissue samples and/or bronchial washings are collected from patients undergoing planned surgery and/or bronchoscopy, respectively. Buccal swabs and/or mouthwash samples and saliva samples are collected. Patients also undergo blood sample collection at baseline and then every 2-6 months thereafter.

Healthy participants contribute blood samples, buccal swabs, and mouthwash samples at baseline only.

Information about medical and family history and cancer risk factors is also collected.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: No limit.

FOLLOW UP: Indefinite, until date of death or lost to follow up.
