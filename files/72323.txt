Construction of an Ultrasound Profile and a Mammographic Profile Corresponding to the Different Molecular Subtypes of Brest Cancer. A Retrospective Study
PROFILS is a retrospective, exploratory study on data collected in 203 breast cancer cases diagnosed during a national screening campaign from 2015 to 2018.

The aim of the study is to analyse histological, clinical and radiological data collected during the screening campaign to build an ultrasound profile and a mammographic profile corresponding to brest cancers' different molecular sub-types (Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2+, Triple negative) using the BI-RADS classification.

The study has the following objectives:

* To compare molecular profiles of breast cancers detected in a cohort of women diagnosed with tomosynthesis and ultrasound with molecular profiles of brest cancers detected in the cohort of women diagnosed with classical mammography and ultrasound
* To describe molecular profiles of cancers detected only with ultrasound,
Breast Cancer
Tumors' characterization using descriptive criteria of the BI-RADS classification, The primary outcome will be tumors' characterization using descriptive criteria of the BI-RADS classification within the framework of a mammography and an ultrasound, and then the research of a correlation with the molecular profile in 203 patientes diagnosed with a breast cancer, 3 years
Comparison of molecular profiles of breast cancers detected in the cohorte "mammography and ultrasound" with molecular profiles of breast cancers detected in the cohorte "tomosynthesis and ultrasound", Chi 2 test or Fisher test for molecular profiles in both cohorts, 3 years|Description of molecular profiles in breast cancers detected only with ultrasound, Descriptive statistics concerning the selection of cancers, 3 years
