Persistent Lymphopenia in Liver Transplantation and Its Molecular Insights for Hepatocellular Carcinoma
A total of 145 Liver transplantation (LT) recipients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were retrospectively enrolled at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital between 2006 and 2019. Clinical records from 7 days before LT (pre-LT) to 1 year after LT (post-LT) were analysed. In a prospective study from March 2022 to June 2023, 20 lymphopenia and 25 non-lymphopenia HCC recipients were enrolled, and a phenotypic analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes was performed using multiparameter flow cytometry.
Lymphopenia
Persistent lymphopenia predict poor overall survival, The clinical records of 145 patients with HCC from seven days pre-LT to one-year post-LT illustrated that the longitudinal values of lymphocytes were persistently low in patients with peritransplant high neutrophil lymphocyte ratio, indicating a significant decrease in survival rate when compared to other patients., From 2006 to 2019|T cell and its subtype were mainly decrease in pre-LT lymphopenia population of HCC patient, A significant decrease in cell counts and percentage of overall T cells in the peritransplant lymphopenia group. In particular, the counts of T cell subsets, T helper cells, and cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8+) cytotoxic/activated T cells significantly decreased in the peritransplant lymphopenia group with all of their na√Øve, effector, and memory forms., From March 2022 to June 2023|Long-term peri-LT lymphopenia HCC recipients is associated with increased sirolimus use and decreased tacrolimus use, In the subset of 116 of 145 HCC recipients (80%) who did not experience or recover from lymphopenia, no significant associations were observed with immunosuppressant use. Surprisingly, HCC recipients with long-term peritransplant lymphopenia exhibited a significant association with increased sirolimus use (p = 0.024) and decreased tacrolimus use (p = 0.001), whereas those with post-LT lymphopenia showed no association with the use of different immunosuppressants., From 2006 to 2019
A total of 145 Liver transplantation (LT) recipients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were retrospectively enrolled at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital between 2006 and 2019. Clinical records from 7 days before LT (pre-LT) to 1 year after LT (post-LT) were analysed including overall survival, recurrence-free survival, association between clinical parameter with mortality, patient characteristics by pre-lymphopenia and post-lymphopenia levels and lymphocyte status of HCC patients with usage of different immunosuppressants. In prospective study from March 2022 to June 2023, 20 lymphopenia and 25 non-lymphopenia HCC recipients were enrolled, and a phenotypic analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes was performed using multiparameter flow cytometry to identify the major immune cell subsets and the characteristics of patients in the prospective cohort between pre-LT lymphopenia and non-lymphopenia groups.
