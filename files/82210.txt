An In-vitro Real-time System Based on Tissue Smears to Identify Malignancy During Hysteroscopic Procedure
The aim of the current study is to develop a near real-time system using infrared spectroscopy, that will evaluate the histological specimen that was removed from the uterine cavity during the hysteroscopy.
Uterine Cervical Neoplasm|Uterine Neoplasms
PROCEDURE: Hysteroscopy|DEVICE: Infrared Spectroscopy
Comparison of infrared spectroscopy with routine histopathology, Tissue smears that have undergone infrared spectroscopy during hysteroscopy will have a different spectral absorption than healthy tissue, thus indicating malignancy. These results will be compared to the results of routine histopathology to determine accuracy of spectroscopy to indicate malignancy., 3 years
