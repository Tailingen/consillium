Serum-Ascites Albumin Gradient Analysis in Cancer Patients in Palliative Care
Current recommendations do not recommend the concomitant administration of albumin after ascites puncture in patients with ascites neoplasia unlike cirrhotic ascites. The etiology of ascites in cancer patients is multifactorial, particularly by hepatic invasion that can lead to ascites loaded with albumin. Ascites punctures therefore lead to undernutrition, recurrent early ascites by decreasing the oncotic pressure by hypo albuminemia and a state of anasarca affecting the quality of life.
Solid Cancer in a Palliative Situation With Ascites
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: cirrhotic albumin|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: serum albumin
Serum-Ascites Albumin Gradient Prevalence, Elevated Serum-Ascites Albumin Gradient Prevalence in Palliative Cancer Patients, 3 months
Metastatic sites, Number of Metastatic sites of patients with a high gradient., 3 months
According to the recommendations, each ascites fluid must be sent for biochemical and bacteriological analysis.

Demonstrate the high gradient proportion (percent only, no threshold of significance required). The literature has already validated the importance of supplementing albumen with cirrhotic ascites. Demonstrating that some cancer patients have high gradients, this will be enough to make the practitioner think to supplement.
