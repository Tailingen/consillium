Research Study of IV Vitamin C in Combination With Irinotecan vs Irinotecan Alone for Advanced Colorectal CA
This protocol is a phase I/II, study of ascorbic acid (AA) infusions combined with treatment with irinotecan versus treatment with irinotecan alone in patients with recurrent or advanced colorectal cancer who have failed at least one treatment regimen with a 5-FU based therapy. This study will be conducted as an amendment to Investigational New Drug # 77486.
Stage IV Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Ascorbic Acid|DRUG: Irinotecan
Number of Participants That Experience Serious Adverse Events as Defined by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0., Safety: The primary aim is to assess whether or not (IV) Ascorbic Acid (AA) with irinotecan therapy is relatively safe and well-tolerated according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0., 9 weeks +/- 2 weeks
Number of Participants That Are Alive After 11 Weeks., To evaluate progression-free survival related to treatment of patients with advanced or recurrent colorectal cancer, 9 weeks +/- 2 weeks
Phase I: To assess whether or not (IV) Ascorbic Acid (AA) with irinotecan therapy is relatively safe and well-tolerated. This aim will be assessed by enrolling a minimum of 6 subjects meeting inclusion criteria, using a modified 3+3 design. Safety will be assessed with the following: toxicity graded by the NCI CTC, urinalysis pre- and post-infusion, basic metabolic panel, and CBC. From our experience and in the experience of our study collaborators, we hypothesize that the combination of IV AA with irinotecan will not be associated with adverse events.

Phase II: To utilize CT or PET/CT (when available) scans to evaluate disease progression to assess overall tumor response rate (complete and partial response) in subjects with advanced or recurrent colorectal cancer treated with the combination of ascorbic acid and irinotecan versus irinotecan alone.
