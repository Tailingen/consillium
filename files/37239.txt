A Phase I Trial of SIM1811-03 in Subjects With Advanced Tumors
This is a first in human, open-label, dose escalation and expansion Phase I study of SIM1811-03 in adult patients with advanced tumors. SIM1811-03 is a first-in-class IgG1-based humanized anti-tumor necrosis factor type 2 receptor (TNFR2) monoclonal antibody for the treatment of malignant tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumor|Cutaneous T Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: SIM1811-03 or in combination with Sintilimab injectiont
Part I The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended dose (RD), Part I (dose escalation): To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended dose (RD) of SIM1811-03 Monotherapy or in combination with sintilimab, Within 28 days after the first dose in Q2W; Within 21 days after the first dose in Q3W|Part II ORR for Solid Tumor, Solid tumors: objective response rate (ORR) assessed by Investigator per RECIST 1.1 from baseline to disease progression, Q2W: Participants will be evaluated every 8 weeks from baseline to Treatment Cycle 12 (an average of 1 year); Q3W:Participants will be evaluated every 6 weeks from baseline to Treatment Cycle 12 (an average of 1 year)|Part II ORR for CTCL, CTCL: ORR assessed by Investigator per global response score, Q2W:Participants will be evaluated every 8 weeks from baseline to Treatment Cycle 12 (an average of 1 year); Q3W:Participants will be evaluated every 6 weeks from baseline to Treatment Cycle 12 (an average of 1 year)

This is a phase I trial to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic characteristics of SIM1811-03 in participants with advanced tumors.

The trial is composed of two parts, Part I and Part II. Part I is a dose escalation part to determine the MTD and/or RD of SIM1811-03 or SIM1811-03 in combination with Sintilimab Injection . Part II is a dose expansion part at RD level SIM1811-03 determined in Part I to assess the anti-tumor activity of SIM1811-03 or SIM1811-03 in combination with Sintilimab Injection in participants with advanced solid tumors or CTCL. The tumor types in Part II will be adjusted based on the response observed in Part I.
