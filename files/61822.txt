Screening of Hereditary Upper Gastrointestinal Cancer in China
Through exploring the specific genetic mutations in the upper gastrointestinal tract tumors with a family history and specific clinical pathological types，we establish a complete family and follow-up system，in order to improve the screening criteria of Chinese hereditary upper gastrointestinal tumors and carry on primary prevention of disease.
Improve the Screening Criteria of Chinese Hereditary Upper Gastrointestinal Tumors
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Gene detection
Pedigree analysis, We plan to analyse the families of patients who met the inclusion criterias through gene detection., In the first phase of the project, we plan to detect 40-50 families in one year. And in the second phase，we will increase the number of predigree to 200. We hope to finish the phase before 2022.3
somatic mutation landscape of hereditary upper gastrointestinal cancer, By comparing the landscape of somatic mutation of patients with different pathogenic germiline mutation , we want to explore the pathogenesis and molecule mechanism of hereditary upper digestive tract tumors., We plan to accomplish sample collection, sequencing and data analysis before 2022.3
