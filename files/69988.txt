Clinical studies related to immunotherapy of HNSCC have shown that PD1 monoclonal antibody has better clinical benefits than conventional chemotherapy. This phase II clinical study is a single arm, open, single-center study. The aim of this study is to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of Sintilimab combined with paclitaxel-albumin-binding for injection in patients with advanced recurrent and metastatic HNSCC who fail to receive first-line or more treatment. Participation in this study for treatment may benefit patients with advanced recurrence or metastasis of HNSCC.
