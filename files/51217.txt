Combination 5-azacitidine and Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin Therapy for Treatment of Relapsed Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
This study will test an experimental combination of the drugs Mylotarg and 5-azacitidine in the hopes of finding a treatment that may be effective against Acute Myeloid Leukemia that has come back after treatment.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: 5-Azacitidine|DRUG: Gemtuzumab ozogamicin
Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities, MTD was the maximum number of 5-azacitadine doses (75mg/m2) at which fewer than 1/3 of patients experienced a DLT during cycle 1 of therapy based on CTCAE Version 3.0. In the phase I portion, we assessed 3 dose levels of azacitidine starting on day 1, with 6, 4, and 4 patients in cohort 1, 2, and 3, respectively. We identified no dose-limiting toxicities and identified the phase 2 dose as 75 mg/m2 of 5-azacitadine for 6 days., up to 28 days
Number of Participants With Response to the Combination Treatment of Mylotarg With 5-azacitidine, Hematologic and Cytogeneic Response to treatment will be assessed when evaluated at the time the ANC has reached 1000/mm3 for three consecutive days, assessed up to 4 years
In the Phase I portion of the study patients with a diagnosis of AML who have relapsed disease will be treated with an assigned number of doses of 5 azacitidine followed by Mylotarg administered two times over two weeks

In the Phase II portion of the study patients will be treated with the dose of 5azacitidine determined to be safe in the Phase I portion of the study followed by Mylotarg.

A sample of blood or bone marrow will be obtained prior to initiation of treatment and another sample obtained after treatment with 5-azacitidine but before Mylotarg and the samples will be tested in the laboratory to determine response to treatment.
