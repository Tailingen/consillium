Trial of Photodynamic Therapy Versus Argon Plasma Coagulation for Lung Cancer With Endobronchial Obstruction
The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT) in relieving airway obstruction in subjects with lung cancer compared to treatment with argon plasma coagulation (APC).
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
PROCEDURE: Photodynamic Therapy|PROCEDURE: Argon Plasma Coagulation
Treatment time until failure, Measure the time until treatment failure. Treatment failure is defined in this study as the occurrence of any of the following: failure to improve airway patency, airway-re-obstruction, need for additional airway intervention, and/or worsening symptoms at 90 days after the last PDT or APC treatment ., 90 days
Change in mean score of quality of life using the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire and Lung Cancer Module (EORTC QLQ-LC13) at 30, 90 and 180 days after the last PDT or APC, QLQ-LC13 incorporates one multi-item scale to assess dyspnoea, and a series of single items assessing pain, coughing, sore mouth, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy, alopecia, and haemoptysis. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high score for the scales and single items represents a high level of symptomatology or problems., 30 days through 180 days|Need for additional bronchoscopic therapies for either endobronchial obstruction at the treated site or for recurrent obstruction with no additional therapies offered at 30, 90, and 180 days following the last PDT or APC treatment, This will be assessed as Yes/No at each of the time points as to whether additional bronchoscopic therapies are needed, in the opinion of the treating investigator, 30 days through 180 days|Median survival time, The median survival time for each treatment cohort will be estimated in days after the last PDT or APC treatment using a Kaplan-Meier survival curve, 6 months|Percent reduction in airway obstruction as measured by bronchoscopy at 30 and 90 days after the last PDT or APC treatment, Percent reduction in airway obstruction will be calculated with the formula: \[(baseline obstruction percentage - residual obstruction percentage)/baseline obstruction percentage x 100%\]., 30 days through 90 days|Resolution of atelectasis, if present, at 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, and 180 days after the last PDT or APC treatment, This will be assessed by examining subject chest x-rays and/or chest CT scans at each of these time points for the presence or absence of atelectasis., 30 days through 180 days|Resolution of post-obstructive pneumonia, if present, at 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, and 180 days after the last PDT or APC treatment, This will be assessed by examining subject chest x-rays and/or chest CT scan for the presence or absence of post-obstructive pneumonia, as well as the physical examination of subjects for post-obstructive pneumonia symptoms (such as fever, pleuritic chest pain, and productive cough) at each of these time points., 30 days through 180 days|Change in dyspnea (as measured by the transitional dyspnea index (TDI), using the score obtained from the Baseline Dyspnea Index (BDI) as the baseline comparator) at 30, 60, 90, and 180 days after the last PDT or APC treatment, The Baseline Dyspnea Index measures the severity of dyspnea at baseline using the sum of the scores for three items that assess functional impairment and magnitude of effort required for daily activities. Total possible score ranges from 0 to 12. A lower total score indicates more severe dyspnea. The Transitional Dyspnea Index evaluates change in dyspnea as compared to the score obtained by the Baseline Dyspnea Index using a scale of -9 to +9. A negative score (-1 to -9) indicates worsening dyspnea as compared to baseline, a positive score (+1 to +9) indicates improvement in dyspnea as compared to baseline, and a score of 0 indicates no change in dyspnea as compared to baseline., 30 days through 180 days|Change in hemoptysis, if present, at 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, and 180 days after the last PDT or APC treatment using categorical measures (worsened, unchanged, improved, resolved), 30 days through 180 days|Change in cough, if present, at 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, and 180 days after the last PDT or APC treatment using categorical measures (worsened, unchanged, improved, resolved), 30 days through 180 days|Change in Karnofsky performance status, if present, at 30, 60, 90, and 180 days after the last PDT or APC treatment using categorical measures (worsened, unchanged, improved, resolved)., 30 days through 180 days|Proportion of patients experiencing treatment failure at 90 days, Treatment failure is defined as failure to improve airway patency, airway re-obstruction, need for additional airway intervention and/or worsening symptoms., 90 days
This is a multi-center, randomized study that will compare the efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT) and argon plasma coagulation (APC) in the treatment of airway obstruction caused by non small cell lung cancer. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive treatment with one of these two treatment modalities.
