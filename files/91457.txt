S0331: Imatinib Mesylate in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Unresectable Merkel Cell Cancer
This phase II trial is studying how well imatinib mesylate works in treating patients with metastatic or unresectable Merkel cell cancer. Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for tumor cell growth

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To assess the feasibility of a Southwest Oncology Group Phase II trial or oral STI-571/imatinib (Gleevec) administered to patients with metastatic or unresectable Merkel cell carcinoma.

II. To evaluate the objective response probability (confirmed and unconfirmed complete and partial responses) of oral STI-571/imatinib (Gleevec) administered to patients with metastatic or unresectable Merkel cell carcinoma.

III. To assess qualitative and quantitative toxicities of oral STI-581/imatinib (Gleevec) administered to patients with metastatic or unresectable Merkel cell carcinoma.

IV. To analyze tumor samples for activating mutations of STI-571/imatinib-sensitive kinases (KIT, PDGFRA, PDGFRB) by denaturing HPLC and direct DNA sequencing.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or symptomatic deterioration.

Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.
