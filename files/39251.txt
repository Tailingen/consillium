Prognostic Score To Predict Major Complications After Pancreaticoduodenectomy
Pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) still carries a high rate of severe postoperative complications. No score is currently available to help identify the patient's surgical risk. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a prognostic score to predict major postoperative complications after PD.
Pancreatic Neoplasm
PROCEDURE: Pancreaticoduodenectomy
Major Complication rate, Clavien-Dindo grade III to V complications considered as major, Postoperative. Until 30 days after discharge
The investigators prospectively collected in an electronic database preoperative, intraoperative and outcome data of 700 patients undergoing PD in our Institution from 2002 to 2010. The investigators used a multivariate logistic regression analysis to create a new score to predict severe complications defined as Clavien-Dindo classification III, IV and V. The score was developed using a random two-thirds of the population (469 patients), and was then validated and calibrated in the remaining third of the patients (231).
