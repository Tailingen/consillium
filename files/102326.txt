MEDI2228 in Subjects With Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics and tolerability, describe the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD \[in the absence of establishing the MTD\]) for single agent MEDI2228 in adult subjects with multiple myeloma who are either transplant ineligible or post autologous stem cell transplant and are relapsed/refractory.
