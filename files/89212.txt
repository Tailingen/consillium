90Y Transarterial Radioembolization Versus Microwave Ablation in Small Hepatocellular Carcinoma With Hypoalbuminemia
This clinical trial will compare 1-year outcomes in patients with hypoalbuminemia and a new diagnosis of small, early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who are candidates for both 90-Yittrium Therasphere transarterial radioembolization (90Y) and microwave ablation (MWA). The study will determine whether treatment with 90Y lowers the risk of disease progression within the first year after diagnosis. Participants will be randomized to receive either first cycle 90Y or MWA and then proceed with standard of care.
Carcinoma, Hepatocellular
DEVICE: Therasphere 90Y|DEVICE: Microwave Ablation
Disease Progression, Progression in disease staging according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer Staging Algorithm, 1-year
Target Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors modified for HCC, Durable target tumor response rate, 60 - 120 days post-treatment|Time to Retreatment, Duration of time following the first cycle treatment until the targeted tumor requires additional treatment, 1 year|Duration of Response, Duration of time after first cycle treatment the target tumor continues to respond to treatment, 1 year
This study will compare 1-year outcomes in patients with hypoalbuminemia and a new diagnosis of early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who are candidates for both 90-Yittrium Therasphere transarterial radioembolization (90Y) and microwave ablation (MWA). The study will focus on patients with solitary, small HCC, defined as a single tumor â‰¤ 3cm in diameter, and with hypoalbuminemia at the time of HCC diagnosis, defined as albumin \< 3.4 g/dL. Participants will be randomized to receive either 90Y or MWA as a first cycle liver-directed therapy.

The study will enroll 50 participants randomized at a 1:1 ratio to 90Y or MWA. After first cycle treatment, the participants will resume standard of care management for early-stage HCC. Participants will undergo observational follow-up for 1-year after first cycle treatment to collect data on adverse events, response to treatment, time to retreatment, duration of response, and progression of disease staging.
