Immunogenicity and Safety of GSK Biologicals' HPV Vaccine 580299 in Healthy Japanese Females 10-15 Years of Age
Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection has been established as a necessary cause of cervical cancer. GSK Biologicals has developed an HPV vaccine (580299) which targets the 2 most common oncogenic HPV types (HPV-16 and HPV-18), found in approximately 70% of all cervical cancers. In previous trials, the vaccine has been found to be efficacious in the prevention of incident and persistent HPV-16/18 infections and associated cytological abnormalities. HPV vaccination should ideally be performed before onset of sexual activity. Previous studies showed that GSK Biologicals' HPV vaccine 580299 is safe and immunogenic when administered to European, Asian, Latin American and Australian pre-adolescents and adolescents. Here, we aim to assess the immunogenicity and safety of the GSK Biologicals' HPV vaccine 580299 in healthy Japanese pre-adolescent and adolescent female subjects aged 10-15 years. The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.
Infections, Papillomavirus
BIOLOGICAL: Cervarix™ (HPV-16/18 L1 VLP AS04)
Number of Subjects Seroconverted for Anti-human Papilloma Virus 16 (Anti-HPV-16) and Anti-human Papilloma Virus 18 (Anti-HPV-18) Antibodies, Seroconversion is defined as the appearance of anti-HPV-16 and/or anti-HPV-18 antibodies (i.e. antibody titer ≥ cut-off value) in the sera of subjects seronegative before vaccination.

Cut-off values were 8 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay units per milliliter (EL.U/mL) for anti-HPV-16 antibodies and 7 EL.U/mL for anti-HPV-18 antibodies., One month post Dose 3 (Month 7)|Anti-HPV-16 and Anti-HPV-18 Antibody Titers, Titers are given as geometric mean titers (GMTs) calculated on all subjects., Before vaccination (PRE) and one month post Dose 3 (Month 7)|Number of Subjects Reporting Solicited Local Symptoms, Solicited local symptoms assessed include pain, redness and swelling., During the 7-day (Days 0-6) period following each vaccination|Number of Subjects Reporting Solicited General Symptoms, Solicited general symptoms assessed include arthralgia, fatigue, fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, headache, myalgia, rash, and urticaria., During the 7-day (Days 0-6) period following each vaccination
Number of Subjects Reporting Unsolicited Adverse Events (AE), Unsolicited adverse event= Any adverse event (AE) reported in addition to those solicited during the clinical study. Also any "solicited" symptom with onset outside the specified period of follow-up for solicited symptoms was reported as an unsolicited adverse event., During the 30-day (Days 0-29) period following each vaccination|Number of Subjects Reporting New Onset of Chronic Diseases (NOCDs) and Other Medically Significant Conditions, NOCDs assessed include e.g. autoimmune disorders, asthma, type I diabetes. Medically significant conditions assessed include adverse events prompting emergency room visits and physician office visits not related to common illnesses or Serious Adverse Events that are not related to common illnesses., From Day 0 up to Month 7|Outcome of All Pregnancies, According to the study protocol, the outcome of all pregnancies reported during the entire study period was to be reported, even if delivery occurs after the end of the study., Up to Month 7|Number of Subjects Reporting Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Serious adverse events assessed include medical occurrences that result in death, are life threatening, require hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, result in disability/incapacity or are a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a study subject., From Day 0 up to Month 7|Number of Subjects Reporting Clinically Relevant Abnormalities in Biochemical and Haematological Parameters, Abnormalities include values outside (above or below) the normal ranges.

Normal ranges:

alanine aminotransferase (ALT): 5-35 U/L aspartate aminotransferase (AST): 5-50 U/L basophils: 0-2 % bilirubin total: 0.1-1.1 mg/dL blood urea nitrogen: 0-20 mg/dL creatinine: 0.2-1.2 mg/dL eosinophils: 0-7 % hematocrit: 30-45 % hemoglobin: 10-15 g/dL lymphocytes: 18-50 % monocytes: 1-8 % neutrophils: 42-74 % platelets: 10-60 10E4/microL red blood cells: 350-550 10E4/microL total protein: 6.5-8.6 g/dL white blood cells: 4000-15000 /microL, At Day 0 and Month 7
