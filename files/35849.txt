A Study of Home Administration of Pemetrexed as Maintenance Treatment for Advanced Nonsquamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
The main purpose for this study is to answer the following research questions:

* Can pemetrexed be administered safely at the participant's home, using the same treatment procedure as in a hospital setting?
* Will the participant be satisfied with home care?
* How might this impact the participant's quality of life?
* What are the required medical resources needed to give pemetrexed in a home setting?
Nonsquamous Non-Small Cell Neoplasm of Lung|Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Metastatic|Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Stage IIIB
DRUG: Pemetrexed
Percentage of Participants Who Adhered to Treatment Administration at Home, Participants were considered adherent from the time of the first dose in Cycle 1 (hospital administration) until either the last day of the cycle when the participant reverted to pemetrexed hospital administration or the last day of the cycle when the participant discontinued study treatment or the study for reasons related to the home setting. The percentage of participants who adhered to treatment administration at home was estimated by a Kaplan-Meier survival analyses approach. Participants who died or discontinued the study and treatment without reverting to hospital administration were censored at the time of discontinuation., Cycle 1, Day 1 through Cycle 19, Day 1 and Cycle 19, Day 1 (21 days/cycle)
Change From Baseline in the European Quality of Life Instrument (EQ-5D) Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), The EQ-5D scale was used to provide an estimate of the health state utility in this population. The EQ-5D scale includes a 5-dimensional descriptive system that measures each of the health state attributes: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression according to a 3-point scale (no problem, some problems, and major problems) and a VAS that allows participants to rate their present health condition from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state). The change from baseline in EQ-5D VAS is reported., Baseline, Day 1 of Cycles 2 and 4 (21 days/cycle) and 30 days post treatment discontinuation|Change From Baseline in the EQ-5D Index Score, The EQ-5D scale was used to provide an estimate of the health state utility in this population. The EQ-5D scale includes a 5-dimensional descriptive system that measures each of the health state attributes: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression according to a 3-point scale (no problem, some problems, and major problems) and a VAS that allows participants to rate their present health condition from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state). The change from baseline EQ-5D Index score is reported and the EQ-5D Index score was calculated by converting health state scores into a weighted health state index according to a United Kingdom population-based algorithm. The possible values for the EQ-5D Index score range from -0.59 (severe problems in all 5 dimensions) to 1.0 (no problem in any dimension), on a scale where 1 represents the best possible health state., Baseline, Day 1 of Cycles 2 and 4 (21 days/cycle) and 30 days post treatment discontinuation|Maximum Improvement Over Baseline in Individual Lung Cancer Symptoms Scale (LCSS) Item Scores, LCSS is a 9-item questionnaire; 6 items are symptom-specific measures for lung cancer (loss of appetite, fatigue, cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis, and pain), and 3 summation items describe overall symptomatic distress, interference with activity level, and overall quality of life during the past 24 hours. Participant responses were measured using a VAS with 100-millimeter (mm) lines. Scores ranged from 0 mm (no symptoms and no impact on activities, quality of life) to 100 mm (symptoms as bad as they could be, impacting activities and quality of life)., Baseline, Day 1 of each cycle (up to Cycle 19, 21 days/cycle), and 30 days post treatment discontinuation|Participant Satisfaction: Chemotherapy at Hospital, Participants were asked to evaluate their hospital experiences in this study by answering 4 questions (Q).
