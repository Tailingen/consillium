Study of the Specific Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in a Sample of Patients and Salaried Staff From a French Anti-cancer Center at the End of the Containment Period of the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic
Since March 2020, France has been confronted with the SARS-COV-2 pandemic. Analysis of the data of its spread would indicate that close contact between individuals is necessary and containment would be the best way to contain this virus. France has therefore been contained since March 17, 2020 until 11 May 2020.

In order to assess the impact of the measures taken (containment) to protect patients and salaried staff of a french anti-cancer center on the spread of the virus, this observational study assesses the specific seroprevalence of SARS-COV-2 in all caregivers and non-carers of this hospital and in patients treated in consultation, day hospitalization, full hospitalization at the end of the containment period.

The objective for the staff cohort is to describe the seroprevalence and the link between the seroprevalence and sociological / demographic factors relating to the category of profession, to the contacts with the patients, to the presence in the hospital during the period of containment, to the conditions of home containment.

The objective for the patient cohort is to describe the seroprevalence and the link between the seroprevalence and factors relating to the type of cancer treated, the type of treatment and their possible modification during the period of containment, to the conditions of home containment.
