Certepetide Phase 1b/2a Continuous Infusion Trial in mPDAC
The goal of this clinical trial is to test a new drug plus standard treatment compared with standard treatment alone in people with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

* is the new drug plus standard treatment safe and tolerable
* is the new drug plus standard treatment more effective than standard treatment

Participants will:

* Visit the clinic three times every 28 days for treatment and tests
* Have CT or MRI scans every 8 weeks while on treatment

Incidence of adverse events, The National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0 (NCI CTCAE) will be used to grade the intensity of adverse events throughout the study, 30 days after treatment discontinuation
This is a Phase 1b/2a, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-arm, randomized study evaluating a single intravenous push of certepetide followed by a continuous infusion of certepetide over 4 hours when added to standard of care (SoC) versus two intravenous pushes of certepetide given 4 hours apart when added to SoC, versus SoC alone in people with previously untreated metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (mPDAC).

The study will consist of a screening period, a run-in period, a treatment period, an end-of-treatment follow-up visit, and a long-term follow up period.

Participants who provide informed consent will be screened for eligibility within 28 days prior to beginning the study treatment run-in period. Once eligibility is confirmed, participants will be randomized to one of the three treatment groups.

During the 3-day run-in period, participants will only receive the LSTA1 or placebo components of their randomized treatment regimen. After the 3-day run-in, Cycle 1 of treatment will commence. Tumor scans will be performed every 8 weeks (56 days Â± 7 days) while on treatment.
