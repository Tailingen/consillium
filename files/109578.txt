A Long-term Study Evaluating Hepatotoxicity Associated With TURALIO™ (Pexidartinib) Treatment
A study to evaluate the long-term risk of hepatic failure with TURALIO™ (pexidartinib) and the mechanism of liver injury based upon liver biopsy information among patients who received or are receiving TURALIO™ (pexidartinib) and experience hepatotoxicity.
Hepatotoxicity|Tenosynovial Giant Cell Tumor
DRUG: TURALIO™
Frequency of Hepatic Failure After Discontinuation of TURALIO™ (pexidartinib), Hepatic failure is defined as severe liver injury with encephalopathy and impaired synthetic function (INR \>= 1.5) as well as liver transplant and hepatic-related death., Baseline up to 10 years
Number of Participants With Liver Test Abnormalities, Liver test abnormalities were defined as the following: Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) \>3 × upper limit of normal (ULN) with concurrent total bilirubin (TBIL) \>2 × ULN; Isolated TBIL \>2 × ULN (excluding patients with Gilbert's syndrome); Isolated AST or ALT \>10 × ULN; Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) \>2 x ULN with gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) \>2 x ULN., Baseline up to 10 years|Number of Participants With A Liver Transplant, Baseline up to 10 years|Number of Participants Experiencing Death, Baseline up to 10 years
This FDA post-marketing requirement study will evaluate the long-term risk of hepatic failure with TURALIO™ (pexidartinib) and the mechanism of liver injury based upon liver biopsy information among patients who received or are receiving TURALIO™ (pexidartinib) for symptomatic tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT) associated with severe morbidity or functional limitations and not amenable to improvement with surgery, and who experience hepatotoxicity. A liver biopsy will be collected from enrolled patients for central laboratory analysis of macrophage and immune cell profiles to investigate possible mechanisms of the hepatotoxicity. Additionally, 4 blood samples will be collected to evaluate liver function, other relevant safety tests, peripheral immune cells, and for pharmacogenomic testing. Enrolled patients will be followed at least yearly for 10 years to assess long-term risk of hepatic failure.
