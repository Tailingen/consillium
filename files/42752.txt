2. The symptom is of moderate intensity, causing obvious discomfort to the patient
3. The symptom is stated as very irritating and severe in intensity, week 3 and week 12 vs baseline|Changes in Total Score of Symptoms of Vaginal Atrophy, Changes in Symptoms of vaginal atrophy (vaginal dryness, dyspareunia and pruritus) at week 3 and week 12 vs baseline.

Each symptom will be scored in a numeric scale from 0 to 3, as shown below:

0 Absence. The symptom is not present

1. The symptom is of mild intensity, without interfering in the patient's activity
2. The symptom is of moderate intensity, causing obvious discomfort to the patient
3. The symptom is stated as very irritating and severe in intensity A Global Symptoms Score will be calculated by summing the intensities of all the three symptoms of vaginal atrophy in a certain time point, thus ranging between 0 and 9., week 3 and week 12 vs baseline|Changes in Dryness of the Mucosa, It will be scored by the investigator on a numerical scale in accordance with their presence and degree of severity as follows:

0 Absence. The sign is not present.

1. The sign is present and is considered a mild alteration
2. The sign is present and is considered a moderate alteration
3. The sign is present and is considered a severe alteration, week 3 and week 12 vs baseline|Changes in Fragility of the Mucosa [Time Frame: Week 3 and Week 12 vs Baseline], It will be scored by the investigator on a numerical scale in accordance with their presence and degree of severity as follows:

0 Absence. The sign is not present.

1. The sign is present and is considered a mild alteration
2. The sign is present and is considered a moderate alteration
3. The sign is present and is considered a severe alteration, from baseline to week 3 and 12|Changes in Vaginal Mucosa With Flattening of Folds or Thinning, It will be scored by the investigator on a numerical scale in accordance with their presence and degree of severity as follows:

0 Absence. The sign is not present.

1. The sign is present and is considered a mild alteration
2. The sign is present and is considered a moderate alteration
3. The sign is present and is considered a severe alteration, week 3 and week 12 vs baseline|Changes in Total Score of Signs of Vaginal Atrophy Between Week 3 and Week 12 to Baseline, The signs evaluated Will be the following: vaginal mucosa with flattening of folds or thinning, dryness of the mucosa and Fragility of the mucosa.

It will be scored by the investigator on a numerical scale in accordance with their presence and degree of severity as follows:

0 Absence. The sign is not present.

1. The sign is present and is considered a mild alteration
2. The sign is present and is considered a moderate alteration
3. The sign is present and is considered a severe alteration A Total Signs Score will be calculated by summing the intensities of all the three signs of vaginal atrophy in a certain time point, thus ranging between 0 and 9., week 3 and week 12 vs baseline|Changes in Vaginal Maturation Value, Vaginal cytology sample to evaluate the vaginal Maturation Value. For the cytologic evaluation, the number of parabasal, intermediate and superficial cells will be calculated in duplicate on 100 consecutive cells of vaginal cytology. The average of the two percentages obtained for each cell type will be calculated, which will serve to determine the maturation value (MV) based on the following formula:

0.2 x (% parabasal) + 0.6 x (% intermediate) + 1.0 x (% superficial)., week 3 and week 12 vs baseline
This is a phase II, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international (Spain and Sweden) and multicentre study.

In the setting of postmenopausal hormone receptor positive breast cancer, treatment with aromatase inhibitors (AIs) is the most effective and well-studied therapy. Vaginal dryness is one of the most frequently reported symptom caused by this adjuvant therapy which may lead to a reduced adherence in breast cancer women.

This study will explore the safety of 0.005% estriol vaginal gel in this oncological context, to demonstrate that this medicinal product is a safe option to treat the vaginal atrophy caused by AIs, without a clinically relevant influence in gonadotropins or systemic estrogen levels.

The main objective is to evaluate the levels of Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) after treatment with 0.005% estriol vaginal gel in hormone receptor-positive postmenopausal women with early stage breast cancer in treatment with Non-Steroidal Aromatase Inhibitors (NSAIs) in the adjuvant setting and symptoms of vaginal atrophy.
