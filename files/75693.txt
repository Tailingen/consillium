Verification of Novel Survival Prediction Algorithm for Patients With NSCLC Spinal Metastasis
The purpose of this study is to learn whether our own made predictive algorithm can be used as a clinical practical decision support for patients with NSCLC spinal metastasis. The scoring system consists of the use of EGFR-TKI, KPS, Age, SCC, CA125 and smoking history. By predicting survival doctors could determine which patients are suitable for palliative therapy.

Survival, Accuracy and sensitivity of novel survival prediction algorithm derived from differences between the predicted and actual survival of NSCLC spinal metastasis patients from 3 different risk groups., Every 6 months from date of diagnosis of NSCLC spinal metastasis until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 3 years
Primary and Metastatic Lesions, Differences in the primary and metastatic lesions after therapy according to NCCN suggestion of NSCLC spinal metastasis patients from 3 different risk groups., Every 6 months from date of diagnosis of NSCLC spinal metastasis until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 3 years|Serum Markers, Differences in the serum markers after therapy according to NCCN suggestion of NSCLC spinal metastasis patients from 3 different risk groups., Every 6 months from date of diagnosis of NSCLC spinal metastasis until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 3 years|Visceral Metastasis, The correlation between visceral metastasis and overall survival (OS) of NSCLC spinal metastasis patients, Every 6 months from date of diagnosis of NSCLC spinal metastasis until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 3 years|Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Assessment of pain level (1-10, higher value represents more pain), Every 6 months from date of diagnosis of NSCLC spinal metastasis until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 3 years|Ambulatory Status, Assessment of walking ability, Every 6 months from date of diagnosis of NSCLC spinal metastasis until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 3 years|EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ) Bone metastasis (BM) 22,, Assessment of quality of life (22-88, higher value represents worse quality of life), Every 6 months from date of diagnosis of NSCLC spinal metastasis until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 3 years|Modified Frankel grade, Assessment of neurological function (A-E, higher value represents better function), Every 6 months from date of diagnosis of NSCLC spinal metastasis until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 3 years|The Spinal Instability Neoplastic Score (SINS), Assessment of spinal instability (0-18, higher value represents worse instability), Every 6 months from date of diagnosis of NSCLC spinal metastasis until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 3 years
Investigators have performed a retrospective study on 176 patients with NSCLC spinal metastasis under the oversight of hospital's ethics committee, and investigators found that the use of EGFR-TKI, KPS, Age, SCC, CA125 and smoking history had significant association with survival. Then investigators built a simple, easy to use scoring system based on the features mentioned above. The score was calculated as 1 (for patients didn't receive EGFR-TKI), +2 (for KPS \<50%), +1 (for KPS 50-70%), +1 (Age \>60years), 2 (SCC ≥1.5ng/ml), +3 (CA125 ≥35 U/ml), +1 (smoking history 1-10/day), +2 (smoking history \>10/day), and 0 otherwise. This algorithm was used to divide the patients into low risk (0-3), intermediate risk (4-6), high risk groups (7-10) to predict survival and determine which patients are suitable for palliative therapy. Now investigators wish to register this study to do a further research, in order to verify the accuracy and sensitivity of this algorithm.
