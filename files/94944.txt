Sequential Radiotherapy With CAR-T Cells in the Treatment of Relapsed and Refractory Hematological Malignancies With Extramedullary Lesions
Clinical trial for the safety and efficacy of sequential radiotherapy with CAR-T cells in the treatment of relapsed and refractory hematological malignancies with extramedullary lesions
Hematological Malignancies
DRUG: CAR-T cells
Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), Adverse events assessed according to NCI-CTCAE v5.0 criteria, Baseline up to 28 days after CAR-T cells infusion|Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events \[Safety and Tolerability\], Up to 2 years after CAR-T cells infusion
Complete Remission Rate, Complete Remission Rate after CAR-T cell therapy, up to 28 days after CAR-T cells infusion|Overall survival (OS), From the first infusion of CD19 CAR-T cells to death or the last visit, Up to 2 years after CAR-T cells infusion|Disease-free survival (DFS), From the complete remission to the occurrence of any event, including death, relapse (any one occurs first), and the last visit, Up to 2 years after CAR-T cells infusion|Quality of life, Assessment using European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) scale \[For item1-28: max score: 112, min score: 28, higher scores mean a better outcome; for item 28-29: max score: 14, min score: 2, higher scores mean a worse outcome\] to measure Quality of life at Baseline, Month 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12, At Baseline, Month 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12
This is a prospective, single arm study. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of sequential radiotherapy with CAR-T cells in the treatment of relapsed and refractory hematological malignancies with extramedullary lesions. The main endpoints were dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and incidence of adverse events (TEAEs).
