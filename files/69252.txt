Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Stage II Bladder Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy following surgery in treating patients with stage II bladder cancer.
Bladder Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: filgrastim|DRUG: cisplatin|DRUG: doxorubicin hydrochloride|DRUG: methotrexate|DRUG: vinblastine sulfate|PROCEDURE: conventional surgery
OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of combination chemotherapy with methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (MVAC) following aggressive transurethral resection of bladder tumors in patients with stage II transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder without nuclear overexpression of mutant p53. II. Determine the proportion of patients treated with this regimen in whom bladder preservation rather than radical cystectomy is possible.

OUTLINE: All patients undergo complete or near complete transurethral resection of the bladder tumor at entry or within 6 weeks prior to entry. Upon confirmation of staging and histology, patients receive combination chemotherapy with methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (MVAC) every 21 days for 4 courses. Subcutaneous G-CSF is given with each course. Patients with a complete response after chemotherapy proceed to intravesical therapy or observation; those with a partial response, stable disease, or progression proceed to definitive surgery.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 30 patients will be entered over approximately 18 months.
