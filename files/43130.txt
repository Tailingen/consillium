Phase 1 Study of CI-8993 Anti-VISTA Antibody in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumor Malignancies
This is a phase 1, open-label, multicenter dose-escalation study to determine the RP2D of CI 8993 for administration to patients with relapsed/refractory solid tumors by evaluating the safety and tolerability and characterizing the PK, PD, and anti cancer activity of CI-8993 in this population.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: CI-8993
To determine the maximum tolerated dose of CI-8993, The highest dose at a schedule, at which the DLT rate during the first cycle of this study (28 days from the first full dose) is \< 33% in at least 6 patients., 2 years|Determine the Recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), The RP2D will be a dose considered to be appropriately safe for a target phase 2 population and exhibit PK and PD characteristics that are favorable and considered likely to support clinical efficacy of CI-8993. The RP2D will be defined by the Safety Review Committee (SRC) based on PK, PD, safety, efficacy results in this study, as well as practical limitations., 2 years

The plan is to enroll approximately 50 patients with metastatic or unresectable solid tumor malignancy (non-lymphoma) that is considered relapsed and/or refractory to prior therapy into specific dose cohorts to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of full doses of CI-8993, based on the occurrence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) 28 days from the first full dose. Administration is every 2 weeks. To assure patient safety, each patient will receive an initial low dose of CI-8993 (step-dose) one week prior to their first full dose.

A Safety Review Committee (SRC) will review all safety data and make cohort escalation/de-escalation decisions.
