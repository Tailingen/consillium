A Study of Duvelisib in Combination With Rituximab or Obinutuzumab in Subjects With Previously Untreated CD20+ Follicular Lymphoma (CONTEMPO)
A Two-arm, Phase 1b/2 Study of duvelisib Administered in Combination with Rituximab or Obinutuzumab in Subjects with Previously Untreated CD20+ Follicular Lymphoma.
CD20+ Follicular Lymphoma
DRUG: Duvelisib|DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Obinutuzumab
Number of Subjects With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) - Part 1, 28 days from first dose of study treatment|Complete Response Rate (CRR)- Part 2, Up to 2 years from the first dose of study treatment
Safety: Composite Measure of Safety, as Indicated by Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Changes in Safety Laboratory Values, Composite measure of safety, as indicated by Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and changes in safety laboratory values. TEAEs assessed as \>=Grade 3., Up to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment|Overall Response Rate (ORR), Up to 2 years from the first dose of study treatment|Duration of Response (DOR), The median DOR was non-estimable., Up to 2 years from the first dose of study treatment|Overall Survival (OS), Up to 2 years from the first dose of study treatment|Pharmacokinetic (PK): Plasma Concentrations of Duvelisib and IPI-656 (Metabolite), Plasma concentrations of Duvelisib and IPI-656 (metabolite), Every 4 weeks for 16 weeks
This is a two-arm, open-label, Phase 1b/2 trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of duvelisib in combination with rituximab and duvelisib in combination with obinutuzumab in subjects with previously untreated CD20+ FL.

The study will be conducted in two parts, a Safety Lead-in (Part 1) followed by a randomized, 2-Stage Design in Part 2. Each treatment arm will be assessed independently for dose limiting toxicity (DLT) within Part 1.
