Safety and Effectiveness of OCL 503 in the Treatment of Women With Leiomyomata
This is a prospective, pilot, open-label, uncontrolled, safety and effectiveness study of uterine artery embolization with OCL 503 in women with leiomyomata who are scheduled for hysterectomy.
Leiomyomata
DEVICE: OCL 503 (uterine artery embolization)
Number of Participants With Serious Adverse Events, Short-term safety of OCL 503 at 7 days post treatment of women with leiomyomata by UAE, as measured by Adverse Events reporting - Serious Adverse Events, 7 days|Change in Fibroid Perfusion From Baseline at 7 Days Post Treatment, Number of participants with decreased fibroid perfusion from baseline at 7 days post treatment of women with leiomyomata by UAE - Decreased Fibroid Perfusion Fibroid perfusion indicative of blood flowing to the fibroid at baseline and 7 days after embolization was determined using MRI., Baseline and 7 days|Number of Participants With Serious Adverse Events, Short-term safety of OCL 503 at 28 days post treatment of women with leiomyomata by UAE, as measured by Adverse Events reporting - Serious Adverse Events, 28 days|Change in Fibroid Perfusion From Baseline at 28 Days Post Treatment of Women With Leiomyomata by UAE, Number of participants with decreased fibroid perfusion from baseline at 28 days post treatment of women with leiomyomata by UAE., Baseline and 28 days

Patients will be allocated to Cohort 1 or Cohort 2. Following pelvic angiogram to delineate the uterine vasculature, embolization procedures of the left and right uterine arteries (as required) will be performed on each patient, using OCL 503 as the embolic agent. Patients in Cohort 1 will proceed to hysterectomy 1 week after embolization, and patients in Cohort 2 will undergo hysterectomy 1 month after embolization. Tumor response, as measured by changes in leiomyomata size and perfusion, will be determined by Magnetic Resonance Imaging or Magnetic Resonance Angiography. Histology of the resected uterus will be conducted to evaluate inflammatory response and viable tumour tissue.
