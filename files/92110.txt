Machine Learning to Predict Factors Affecting Rehabilitation Length of Stay and Healthcare Costs for Neurological Rehabilitation
The aim of this retrospective study is to ascertain total direct costs, rehabilitation length of stay (RLOS) and factors associated with RLOS for neurological inpatient rehabilitation at the tertiary care hospital.

Rehabilitation length of stay, Duration of which patient is admitted to and discharge from the rehabilitation ward., 1998-2022|Hospital bill, Bill size of patient's stay in the rehabilitation ward, including subsidies, insurance and copayment., 2012-2022|Housing type, Type of housing to look at the socio-economics status of the patients., 2014-2023
The aim of the study is to identify factors that influence RLOS and the correlated costs for neurological rehabilitation in tertiary rehab using data extracted from EPIC. It is also aimed to identify the median direct costs to find out the main contributors to the costs in the local population. Lastly, the study aims to utilise artificial intelligence or machine learning to analyse the compiled data to develop a predictive model. The model aspires to understand factors associated with extended RLOS and to predict RLOS of patients who require neurological rehabilitation, aiding preemptive measures.
