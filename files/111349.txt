Breast Neoplasms|Mammaplasty
DRUG: ARTISS 4mL Fibrin Sealant Topical Solution (Frozen)|OTHER: no ARTISS
post-operative abdominal mean drainage duration, post-operative abdominal mean drainage duration, 42 days
The principle aim of the study is to investigate the effect of ARTISS on abdominal wound drainage whether this could result in earlier drain removal and earlier patient discharge from hospital. The primary outcome investigated will be post- operative abdominal drainage duration in days which is vital information during this Covid pandemic to reduce hospital stay (and therefore possible Covid exposure) which could result in earlier discharge from hospital, as well as significantly reducing cost of the procedure to the NHS and frees in-patient beds for more efficient use of resources.
