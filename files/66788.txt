Extension to Study of Effects of Pomegranate Extract on Rising PSA Levels After Primary Therapy for Prostate Cancer
High concentrations of anti-oxidants in pomegranate seeds present a potential strategy to delay clinical prostate cancer progression and prolong the interval from primary treatment failure to hormonal ablation. This is a 48 month extension to the double-blind GUP-0205-1 study, to compare the effects of daily consumption of pomegranate liquid extract versus placebo on the absolute prostate-specific antigen (PSA) doubling time at the end of 12, 24, 36 and 48 months in male subjects who rolled-over from the GUP-0205-1 study.

The primary outcome variable will be the mean PSA doubling time at the end of 12, 24,36 and 48 months., 48 months
The mean change in PSA doubling time from baseline to end-of-treatment., 48 months|Response rates in positive and negative PSA doubling times with a clinically significant positive doubling time is defined as >150% of baseline., 48 months|Overall efficacy responses categorized as Objective Response, Progressive Disease, Stable Disease., 48 months|Measures of tolerability (adverse events) and toxicity (clinical chemistries, etc.)., 48 months
The primary objectives are to compare the effects of daily consumption of pomegranate liquid extract versus placebo on the absolute prostate-specific antigen (PSA) doubling time at the end of 12,24, 36 and 48 months in male subjects who rolled-over from the GUP-0205-1 study. Secondary objectives are to determine the effect of the pomegranate treatment on the change in PSA doubling time from baseline to each 12-month visit, to determine the time to tumor recurrence, to assess the tolerability and toxicity of the pomegranate treatment and to determine the effect of the pomegranate treatment on response rates for positive PSA doubling times and for declining post-treatment PSA levels (negative doubling times).
