Study of ORIC-101 in Combination With Enzalutamide
The purpose of this study is to establish the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary antitumor activity of ORIC-101 in combination with enzalutamide (Xtandi®) when administered to patients with metastatic prostate cancer progressing on enzalutamide.

ORIC-101 is a small molecule GR antagonist being developed for the treatment of patients with solid tumor malignancies. Mechanistically, ORIC-101 inhibits GR transcriptional activity and blocks the pro-survival signals mediated by the activated nuclear receptor.

This is an open-label, single arm, multicenter, dose escalation followed by dose expansion study to assess the safety and preliminary antitumor activity of ORIC-101 in combination with enzalutamide in patients progressing on enzalutamide. Patients deemed eligible will receive treatment with ORIC-101 in addition to continuing their current enzalutamide therapy.

Escalating dose levels of ORIC-101 will be administered orally, once daily in combination with enzalutamide 160 mg. Parallel enrollment for assessment of PK/PD modulation in up to 3 additional patients presenting with tumors expressing high levels of GR (GR-high) may be performed at each dose level after the dose level has cleared the initial dose-limiting toxicity evaluation period; these additional patients may serve as supplemental patients for selection of the maximum tolerated dose and/or RP2D.

Dose expansion will further evaluate the safety and preliminary antitumor activity of ORIC-101 in patients presenting with different levels of GR expressing-tumors.
