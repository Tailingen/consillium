Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of Proxalutamide Therapy in Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer
This study is a multi-center, open-label, dose-esclation I/Ib clinical study to explore safety, efficacy an pharmacokinetics of proxalutamide in patients with metastatic breast cancer.

This study includes two stages, stage I: single- and multiple-dose tolerance and pharmacokinetic study; stage 2: preliminary efficacy and safety study.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Proxalutamide
Dose-limiting Toxicity(DLT), Each dose cohort will initially include 3 evaluable patients for assessment of toxicity within the 35 days following the first dose of GT0918., 35 days|maximum tolerated dose (MTD), 100 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg, 400 mg or 500 mg of GT0918, 35 days|Disease Control Rate(DCR), Preliminary evaluation of the DCR of GT0918 tablets in AR positive metastatic breast cancer patients, and determination of the recommended dose of proclamine in clinical trials., 16 weeks

This study is a multi-center, open-label, dose-esclation study.

Subjects will be enrolled to the 100mg, 200mg, 300mg, 400mg and 500mg group in turn. Unless DLT was found, the dose esclation will continue. 28 days of DLT observation period is needed after 7-day single dose administration, until disease progression, intolerable toxicities (AEs), or withdrawn consent.

After the completion of stage 1, 2 doses for the stage 2 will be determined. In stage 2, patients with AR-positive metastatic breast cancer will be selected to explore the efficacy and safety of proxalutamide, and biomarkers will be explored.
