Barrigel® PPRT (Post-Prostatectomy Radiation Therapy) Trial
Barrigel is intended to temporarily position the anterior rectal wall away from the prostate or prostate bed during radiotherapy treatment for prostate cancer and, in creating this space, it is the intent of Barrigel to reduce the radiation dose delivered to the anterior rectum.
Prostate Cancer
DEVICE: Barrigel|DEVICE: Transrectal Ultrasound
Reduction in volume of rectum receiving radiation dose, Investigational subjects only: Achievement of a ≥ 25% change in reduction in the volume of rectum receiving 90% of the prescription dose in 70% of the subjects., 3 months
Grade 2 Toxicities, Test whether the use of the Barrigel spacer does not increase the incidence of acute grade 2+ GI toxicity within the first 3 months, which will be assessed using the proportion of subjects who have one or more incidences of acute grade 2+ GI toxicity within the first 3 months., 3 Months|Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) bowel QOL, Evaluate the change in Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) Bowel Assessment composite score (from baseline within 3 months after completion of radiation therapy. The EPIC is graded on a 12 point scale, with a higher score indicating a higher outcome., 3 months|Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) Urinary QOL, Evaluate the change in Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) Urinary Assessment composite score from baseline within 3 months after completion of radiation therapy. The EPIC is graded on a 12 point scale, with a higher score indicating a higher outcome., 3 months
Adverse Events, All adverse events, 3 months
Barrigel is composed of biodegradable material and maintains space for the entire course of prostate or prostate bed radiotherapy and is intended to be absorbed by the patient's body over time.

To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Barrigel to reduce the radiation dose delivered to the anterior rectum by creating a space when injected between the rectum and the prostate bed in men receiving definitive external beam radiation therapy (intensity-modulated radiation therapy) for recurrence of prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.

A prospective, randomized, controlled, single-masked multicenter study.
