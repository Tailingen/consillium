A Phase 2 Study of Lamivudine in Patients With p53 Mutant Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
This research study is studying a drug as a possible treatment for p53 mutant metastatic colorectal cancer.

The drug involved in this study is:

-Lamivudine
Colorectal Cancer Metastatic
DRUG: Lamivudine
Overall Response Rate, Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by CT scan or MRI, complete response (CR) is the disappearance of all target lesions and partial response (PR) is a \>/=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions. Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR. The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). The patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria., 2 years
Progression Free Survival, Progression-Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from registration to the earlier of progression or death due to any cause. Participants alive without disease progression are censored at date of last disease evaluation., 2 years|Overall Survival, Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from registration to death due to any cause, or censored at date last known alive., up to 2 years|Overall Disease Control Rate, Disease control rate (DCR) describes the percentage of patients with advanced cancer whose therapeutic intervention has led to a complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 criteria:

* CR is the disappearance of all target lesions
* PR is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions
* SD is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD)
* PD is at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions, and the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions., up to 2 years
This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied.

The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved lamivudine for this specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.

In this research study, the investigators are studying the effects of lamivudine on this type of cancer. This drug may help prevent the growth and spread of the cancer cells to other parts of the body. The investigators have discovered that this particular type of colon cancer, which has a p53 mutation may be sensitive to treatment with lamivudine by impairing the ability of the cancer cells to grow.
