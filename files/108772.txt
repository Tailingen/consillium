Lenvatinib Combined Toripalimab in Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The investigators design a phase IIB clinical study to explore the efficacy and safety of Lenvatinib plus Toripalimab in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and to analyze potential biomarkers of therapeutic response.

This trial is a single-arm, non-randomized and single-center clinical study of targeted therapy combined immunotherapy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.

It is estimated that 76 patients who met the study criteria will be enrolled in Peking Union Medical College Hospital(PUMCH) and treated with Lenvatinib and Toripalimab. The investigators will follow up and collect subjects' data monthly to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment, including overall survival and time to progression. Multi-omics data analysis will be used to find potential biomarkers of treatment response.
