A Study to Test Whether Treatment With BI 770371 in Combination With Pembrolizumab With or Without Cetuximab Helps People With Head and Neck Cancer Compared With Pembrolizumab Alone
This study is open to adults with head and neck cancer. The purpose of this study is to find out whether combining different study medicines makes tumors shrink in people with head and neck cancer.

The tested medicines in this study are antibodies that act in different ways against cancer. BI 770371 and pembrolizumab may help the immune system fight cancer. Cetuximab blocks growth signals and may prevent the tumor from growing.

Participants are put into 3 groups randomly. Each group receives a different combination of study medicines. All study medicines are given as an infusion into a vein at the study site.

Participants can stay in the study as long as they benefit from treatment. Doctors regularly check the size of the tumor and check whether it has spread to other parts of the body. The doctors also regularly check participants' health and take note of any unwanted effects.
Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: BI 770371|DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Cetuximab
Objective response (OR) with confirmation, OR defined as the best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), where best overall response is determined according to response evaluation criteria in solid tumours version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1).

Objective response (OR) will be defined by investigator's assessment from first treatment administration until the earliest of disease progression, death, or last evaluable tumour assessment before start of subsequent anti-cancer therapy, lost to follow-up or withdrawal of consent., Up to 27 months
Occurrence of treatment related adverse event (AE) from first treatment administration until the earliest of death, subsequent anti-cancer therapy, lost to follow-up or withdrawal of consent, Up to 27 months|Occurrence of treatment related adverse event (AE) leading to treatment discontinuation from first treatment administration until the earliest of death, subsequent anti-cancer therapy, lost to follow-up or withdrawal of consent, Up to 27 months|Overall survival (OS), OS defined as the time from first treatment administration until death from any cause., Up to 27 months|Overall survival at 6 and 12 months (OS6 and OS12), OS defined as being alive at 6 months or at 12 months from first treatment administration., At 6 months and 12 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS defined as the time from first treatment administration until Disease progression (PD) according to RECIST v1.1 or death from any cause, whichever occurs earlier., Up to 27 months|Progression-free survival at 6 months (PFS6), PFS defined as being alive and without progression at 6 months from first treatment administration., At 6 months|Duration of objective response (DOR), DOR defined as the time from first documented CR or PR (RECIST v1.1) until the earliest of PD or death among patients with OR., Up to 27 months
