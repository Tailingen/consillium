Ramucirumab and Carbo-Paclitaxel for Untreated Thymic Carcinoma / B3 Thymoma With Carcinoma (RELEVENT)
This is a multicentric study. All patients with TET (thymic epithelial tumors) of any histological type will participate in the study. This is an open-label phase 2 study that will follow a Green-Dahlberg 2-stage design whose objective is to evaluate the activity and safety of the combination of ramucirumab (10 mg / kg) + carboplatin (AUC 5) and paclitaxel (200 mg / m2) in patients with relapsed and / or metastatic thymic carcinoma/ thymoma B3, in the first line (RELEVENT trial).
Thymic Carcinoma|Thymoma
COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Ramucirumab
Best tumour response (CR+PR), Objective tumor response will be assessed according to RECIST 1.1., 6 months
Progression Free Survival (PFS), Disease progression will be established as the radiological progression according to RECIST 1.1 or through clinical assessment in case radiological evaluation is not feasible or as death from any cause due to clinical condition. PFS will be estimated through Kaplan-Meier method, 4 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS will be estimated through Kaplan-Meier method, 4 years|Safety, AE/SAE will be reported and graded. Evaluaton of relationship with experimental drug will be done, 4 years
Comprehensive analysis of tumor mutational status on paraffin-embedded tissue, Targeted re-sequencing of genes mutated in TETs in order to define the prognostic role of somatic mutations and their potential association to prognosis or response to therapy, 4 years|Comprehensive analysis of single nucleotide polymorphism in blood, Genome-wide approach using a platform able to investigate more than 4 million SNP in order to find potential association with prognosis or response to therapy, 4 years|Analysis of circulating micro-RNA, Analysis of micro-RNA in plasma and their evaluation as possible biomarker associated with prognosis or response to therapy, 4 years|Quality of life analysis through collection of Patients Reported Outcome (PROs), Web based PROs will be administered at each visit and data about compliance will be collected, 4 years
Clinical and quality of life data will be collected for all treated patient. Based on the histological evaluation performed by each participating center, patients will be screened for inclusion in one of the four studies, based on the following criteria:

* TOPS study only: all patients with A, AB, B1, B2, B3 without areas of carcinoma histology, diagnosed during or after 2018, that do not have a fresh tissue sample and screen failures of the RELEVENT and BIOTET study;
* TRY registry: all patients with TETs diagnosed, treated or followed from 2010 to 2017 included (retrospective data collection);
* BIOTET only: all patients with A, AB, B1, B2, B3 without areas of histology of the carcinoma that have a fresh tissue sample;
* RELEVENT only: all patients with thymoma B3 and areas of carcinoma and pa-tients with thymic carcinoma who do not have a fresh tissue sample.

Patients with thymic carcinoma or thymoma B3 with areas of carcinoma will receive a centralized pathological review of the tumour block or slides and will be screened to participate in the Phase II RELEVENT pharmacological study.Histological diagnosis will be confirmed before screening.
