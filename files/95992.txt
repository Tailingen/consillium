Radiotherapy Combined With Thymosin for Metastatic NSCLC Patients Who Showed Stable Disease After First Line TKI Therapy
The investigators postulated that the exploitation of the pro-immunogenic effects of radiotherapy with thymosin might result in abscopal responses among patients with metastatic cancer. The research is designed to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of patients treated with hypofractionated radiotherapy combined with thymosin alpha 1. An exploratory biomarker analysis in blood and tumor samples is also planned.
Lung Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: TKI|RADIATION: Thoracic Hypofractionated Radiotherapy|DRUG: Thymosin Alpha 1
The proportion of patients with an abscopal response assessed at 1-6 months after the radiation therapy, To assess the proportion of patients with an abscopal response (defined as at least a 30% decrease in the longest diameter of the best responding abscopal lesion) at 1-6 months after the radiation therapy, 1-6 months
To assess the short-term quality of life (QOL), FACT-E score at the 4 months after docetaxel consolidation therapy, 4 months|Rate of CTCAE grade 2 or higher radiation pneumonitis, The investigators will assess the rate of symptomatic radiation pneumonitis in patients who received the radiation therapy, 1 years|Overall Survival, 2 years
