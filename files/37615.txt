3-Dimensional Conformal Radiation Therapy In Treating Women With Stage I or Stage II Breast Cancer Previously Treated With Lumpectomy and Axillary Node Dissection
RATIONALE: 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor and may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue.

PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy in treating women who have undergone lumpectomy and axillary node dissection for stage I or stage II breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
RADIATION: radiation therapy
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the technical feasibility and reproducibility of three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy confined to the region of the lumpectomy cavity in women with stage I or II breast cancer.
* Determine the cosmetic results in patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the complication rates in patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the local control rate in patients treated with this regimen.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients undergo three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy twice daily for 5 days beginning within 8 weeks after surgery.

Patients are followed at 6 weeks, every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-46 patients will be accrued for this study within 6.3 to 15.3 months.
