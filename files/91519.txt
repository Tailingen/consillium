Detection of Heterogeneity in Central Lung Cancer - EBUS-TBNA and ctDNA Analysis vs. Endobronchial Forceps Biopsy
Study participants will be selected from clinical routine patients with endobronchial infiltration of a central lung cancer and indication for bronchoscopic sampling.

Consented patients will undergo bronchoscopy for tumor sampling applying two routine sampling methods during one single procedure (EBUS-TBNA and conventional forceps sampling). The sequence of both sampling methods will be randomized in advance.

The resulting tissue samples will be analyzed by a pathologist using multiplex PCR and FISH. The corresponding analysis results will be compared between sampling methods.

Assignment of a subject to a particular therapeutic strategy is not influenced by this protocol. Medicinal products will be used according to current practice and marketing authorisation.
Lung Neoplasms
PROCEDURE: EBUS-TBNA|PROCEDURE: Endobronchial forceps biopsy
Number of detected mutations, The number of different mutations detected based on each biopsy method as well as ctDNA analysis is determined, within 7 days after biopsy
