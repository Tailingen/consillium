From Fetal-maternal Interface Immune Tolerance to Endometrial Cancer Immune Escape: Potential Targets for Immunotherapy
Non-interventional retro-prospective study on Endometrial tissue samples taken from surgically treated patients.
Endometrial Cancer
Validate the differential expression of LOX-1 and NALP3 receptors., Validate the differential expression of LOX-1 and NALP3 receptors at different steps progression of endometrial cancer; identify immune signatures shared between using transcriptomics the maternal-fetal interface and the different stages of progression of endometrial cancer; investigate their role functional in the immune escape process in endometrial carcinoma and/or in the pro-inflammatory response., 36 months
Characterize phenotypic alterations., Characterize the phenotype and functional alterations of multiple candidate biomarkers relevant selected in AIM1 (surface antigens / cytokines / molecular pathways), a level of the cells of the immune infiltrate, in the different stages of cancer progression to the endometrium., 36 months|Evaluate the predictive and/or prognostic value., Evaluate the predictive and/or prognostic value of the immuno-score deriving from the data of Aim 1 and Aim 2 alone or in combination with clinical and prognostic risk factors known histopathological findings, expressed in the ESMO-ESGO-ESTRO consensus conference., 36 months
The picture of precisely coordinated immune adaptations over time at the maternal-fetal interface level and altered in pregnancy complications, could reveal a specific "immune clock" in tumors. The study aims to decipher mechanisms of immunodeficiency by helping to predict recurrence in patients with endometrial cancer and identify molecular pathways that are turned on or off in progression from lesions early to advanced neoplasia. This will allow the discovery of potential immunotherapy targets to interfere with the immune escape activation process or to reactivate/re-educate the immune response.
