Artificial Intelligence for Determination of Gastroscopy Surveillance Intervals
The purpose of this study is to develop and validate a clinical decision support system based on automated algorithms. This system can use natural language processing to extract data from patients' endoscopic reports and pathological reports, identify patients' disease types and grades, and generate guidelines based follow-up or treatment recommendations
