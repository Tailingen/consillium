The Efficacy and Drug Resistance Molecular Biology of Apatinib Combined With EGFR-TK1 Treated for Advanced Slow-progressed Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
Patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who progress slowly after Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors（EGFR-TKI）resistance. The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and drug resistance mechanism of Apatinib combine with EGFR-TK1 treated for advanced slow progressed non-small cell lung cancer and provide new treatment options.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Apatinib（250mg/d） combined with EGFR-TKI
Objective response rates (ORR), Objective response rate is defined as the percentage of subjects having achieved confirmed Complete Response + Partial Response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1（RECIST1.1）, two years
Disease control rate (DCR), Disease Control Rate is defined as the percentage of subjects having achieved confirmed Complete Response + Partial Response + Stable Disease according to radiological assessments., two years|Overall survival (OS), Time from randomization to death for any cause., two years|Progression free survival (PFS), PFS defined as date of randomization until the date of objectively determined progression defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria or death from any cause, whichever is first., two years|Drug safety: Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events, Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, two years
Epidermal growth factor receptor Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR TKI) have been approved to treat NSCLC harboring EGFR mutation as first-line therapy. However, a large proportion of patients would become acquired resistant of EGFR-TKI after about one year although initially sensitivity. Previous studies demonstrated that the anti-angiogenesis combined with EGFR-TKI in slow-progressed EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer achieved good efficacy and disease control rates, prolonged the progression free survival. The present study is aim to expand the number of samples to monitor resistance-related genes and tumor cells. Furthermore, to investigate the mechanism of anti-angiogenesis combine with EGFR-TKI and provide the theory for the use and promotion of clinically protocols. In this study, the primary objective is the objective response rates and the secondary goal are disease control rates, overall survival, progression free survival and drug safety.
