A Study of 18F-AlF-NOTA-Neurotensin PET/CT for Imaging Prostate Cancer
The aim of this study is to investigate the clinical value of \[18F\]aluminum fluoride-1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid-neurotensin（18F-AlF-NOTA-neurotensin）positron emission tomography / computed tomography (PET/CT) in patients with prostate cancer (PCa).
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: 18F-AlF-NOTA-neurotensin
18F-AlF-NOTA-neurotensin PET/CT imaging of patients with Prostate Cancer, The radioligand 18F-AlF-NOTA-neurotensin can be used to visualize prostate cancer, 12 months
18F-AlF-NOTA-neurotensin PET/CT prognostic factor for overall and disease specific survival, The standard uptake value (SUV) of the 18F-AlF-NOTA-neurotensin in prostate cancer lesions is associated with Gleason score, staging and risk stratification of prostate cancer.

SUV (g/mL)=Cimg / (ID/BW) ; Cimg is the prostate cancer pixel intensities of a calibrated PET image (MBq/ml), ID is the injected dose or injected radioactivity (MBq),BW is the body weight (g) .

Gleason score of a prostate biopsy or radical prostatectomy., 24 months
18F-AlF-NOTA-neurotensin is a radioligand targeting the neurotensinreceptor, which is widely expressed on the cell surface of PCa. The radioligand can be used for the diagnosis and stage of the PCa. A total of 5 volunteers and 60 PCa patients will be subjected to a 18F-AlF-NOTA-neurotensin PET/CT scan. The uptake of 18F-AlF-NOTA-neurotensin in organs and tumor lesions will be quantified as Standardized Uptake Values (SUVmax/SUVmean).
