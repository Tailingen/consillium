A Study Evaluating the Efficacy, Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of AUR 109 in Patients with Colorectal, Ovarian, and Renal Cancers
This is an open-label, multicentre, randomized, Phase II study and will be conducted with co-primary objectives of the study are to assess the efficacy of AUR109, as measured by ORR and safety / tolerability at three different dose levels of the study drug in three cancer indications i.e., colorectal, ovarian cancer and renal cancer.
Ovarian Cancer|Colorectal Cancer|Renal Cancer
DRUG: AUR109 200mg|DRUG: AUR109 300mg|DRUG: AUR109 400mg
Safety and Efficacy, To assess the safety and efficacy of three dose levels of AUR109 (200 mg, 300 mg, and 400 mg) in patients with colorectal, ovarian, and renal cancers, as measured by Objective Tumor Response Rate (ORR) (CR + PR)., Baseline, Cycle 2 Day 1,Cycle 4 Day 1,Cycle 6 Day1,Cycle 8 Day 1 and Cycle 10 Day 1 (each cycle is 21 days)
Pharmacokinetic Profile (Cmax), Maximum concentration of AUR109, Day 1 and Day 15|Pharmacokinetic Profile (Tmax), Tmax in hours, Day 1 and Day 15|Pharmacokinetic Profile (AUC), Area under the curve of AUR109 in ng/ml, Day 1 and Day 15|HRQoL, FACT-G (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General) Score (scalle range is 0 (Lowest) to 4 (Highest), Assessment will be performed at 3 rd week (Day 15 to 21) of every 3 cycles (21 days per Cycle) until either progressive disease or intolerable toxicity occurs
This is a Phase II, open-label, multicenter study evaluating the efficacy and safety of the drug AUR109 at three different dose levels (200 mg, 300 mg, and 400 mg) in patients with colorectal, ovarian, or renal cancer. Participants must have undergone at least two lines of systemic therapy and exhausted all local treatment options. The 200 mg and 300 mg doses will be administered continuously over a 21-day cycle, while the 400 mg dose will follow an interrupted regimen (2 weeks on, 1 week off). The drug is to be taken once daily according to the specified dosing schedule.
