Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety With CAR-T for Liver Cancer
This single-arm,multicenter Phase 2 trial will treat the patients who have relapsed or refractory liver cancer with an infusion of the patient's own T cells that have been genetically modified to express a chimeric antigen receptor(CAR)that will bind to tumour cells that express the EPCAM protein on the cell surface.The study will determine if these modified T cells help the body's immune system eliminate tumour cells.The trial will also study the safety of treatment with CAR-T,how long CAR-T cells stay in the patient's body and the impact of this treatment on survival.
Liver Neoplasms
BIOLOGICAL: EPCAM-targeted CAR-T cells
Disease control rates, Tumor complete remission number + partial response number + number of stable disease /Total number of cases being treated, CAR - T back to lose 0 days to 180 days
This is a single-arm,multicenter Phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the CAR-T for Liver Cancer.The study will be conducted using a phaseⅠ /Ⅱ disign.The study will have the following sequential phases:Part A(screening leukapheresis,cell product preparation,and cytoreductive chemotherapy) and Part B(treatment and follow-up).The follow-up period for each paticipant is approximately 35 months after the final CAR-T infusion.The total duration of the study is expected to be approximately 3 years.A total of 25 patients may be enrolled over a period of 3 years.
