A Clinical Trial Aimed At Assessing the Efficacy and Safety of VT-101 for the Treatment of Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer
This is an experimental study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of VT-101 for the treatment of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer
Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Recombinant oncolytic adenovirus injection solution of VT-101
Incidence and severity of possible adverse events after intravesical instillation of VT-101, To evaluate the safety of VT-101 in the treatment of non-muscular invasive bladder cancer.Changes in vital signs, physical examination results, ECOG performance score, laboratory tests, and 12-lead electrocardiogram before, after, and during treatment., 3 months after VT-101 intravesical instillation|The proportion of patients who suspend or discontinue treatment due to drug toxicity, Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) is defined as an event related to the investigational drug that meets any of the following criteria during the observation period:

Any toxicity ≥ Grade 3 except for fatigue lasting ≤3 days or fatigue and weakness that can be relieved through rest or self-adjustment; clinically insignificant reversible laboratory abnormalities ≥ Grade 3.

Any toxicity that cannot recover to ≤ Grade 1 baseline level within seven days after discontinuation of dosing., 3 months after VT-101 intravesical instillation
Complete Response (CR) Rate, To observe the efficacy of VT-101 after intravesical infusion.Complete Response (CR) is defined as either a) negative cystoscopy and negative urine cytology (including atypical) or b) negative cystoscopy, positive urine cytology and negative random bladder biopsy., 3 months after VT-101 intravesical instillation|Partial Response (PR) Rate, To observe the efficacy of VT-101 after intravesical infusion.Partial Response (PR) is defined as a reduction of the tumor by more than 50% over a period of not less than 4 weeks, which can be measured by either double-path or single-path measurements. (a) Double diameter measure1) Single lesion: tumor area (the product of the two largest vertical diameters of the mass) reduced by ≥50%; 2) Multiple lesions: the sum of the product of the two largest vertical diameters of multiple masses is reduced by more than 50%. (b) Single diameter measurement: The measured value of linear mass is reduced by more than 50%., 3 months after VT-101 intravesical instillation|Stable Disease (SD), To observe the efficacy of VT-101 after intravesical infusion.Stable disease (SD) is defined as being somewhere between partial remission and disease progression., 3 months after VT-101 intravesical instillation|Progressive Disease (PD), To observe the efficacy of VT-101 after intravesical infusion.Progressive Disease (PD) is defined as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest tumor diameters or the appearance of one or more new lesions compared to the sum of the smallest tumor longest diameters recorded after the start of treatment., 3 months after VT-101 intravesical instillation|Disease-Free Survival (DFS), To observe the efficacy of VT-101 after intravesical infusion.Disease-free survival (DFS) was defined as continuous CIS≥6 months from the time of first dosing to the onset of any Ta, any T1 grade, new CIS, disease progression, cystectomy, change in treatment due to disease deterioration, or death (any cause)., 3 months after VT-101 intravesical instillation
The investigators designed a clinical study and divided the trial into two phases.

Phase 1(climbing test): The first dose group (2×10\^10 IFU) in the ramp-up phase is the accelerated titration dose group, which will include one patient. During the observation period of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in the accelerated titration phase (set as 7 days after initial drug administration for each participant), if a grade 2 or higher treatment-related adverse event (TRAE) is observed, or when escalating to the second dose group (5×10\^10 IFU dose group), it will transition to a conventional escalation phase using a 3+3 dose escalation design: If no DLT occurs in 0/3 participants during the observation period, it will escalate to the next dose; if DLT occurs in 1/3 participants during the observation period, an additional three participants will be enrolled at this dosage level simultaneously. If no DLT occurs among these additional three participants during their observation period (total of 1/6 subjects with DLT), it will proceed to the next dose group. If ≥2/6 participants experience DLT, then the ramp-up trial will terminate and a lower dosage level below current level will be selected for dosing expansion stage. Alternatively, based on existing clinical data, the investigators may redefine ramp-up doses. If no DLT occurs in 0/3 or 1/6 of participants during the observation period of the 10×10\^10 IFU dose group, the investigators determine whether to continue increasing ramp-up doses and ultimately determine dosages for expansion stage based on exploration results from ramp-up phase. Participants who do not experience DLT during ramp-up phase can continue receiving study drug at same dosage via intravesical instillation once weekly for six consecutive weeks (including initial administration). Subsequent administration is determined by the investigators monthly and should not exceed one year unless disease progression or recurrence occurs, intolerable toxicity develops, participant withdraws informed consent or dies, the investigator deems continued treatment inappropriate or other termination criteria are met according to earliest.

Phase 2:During the expansion phase, approximately 8-10 participant will be enrolled based on the recommended dose from the escalation phase. The number of participant may be adjusted by the investigators based on existing trial data, and non-resectable high-risk and very high-risk NMIBC patients may also be included in the expansion phase study. The dosing plan for the expansion phase is as follows: multiple administrations once a week through intravesical instillation for six consecutive weeks. Subsequent administration frequency will be determined by the investigators (once a month, up to a maximum of one year) or until disease progression or recurrence occurs, intolerable toxicity arises, participant withdraws informed consent or dies, the investigator deems it inappropriate to continue treatment, or other termination criteria are met with priority given to events occurring first.

Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) is defined as an event related to the investigational drug that meets any of the following criteria during the observation period:

1. Any toxicity ≥ Grade 3 except for fatigue lasting ≤3 days or fatigue and weakness that can be relieved through rest or self-adjustment; clinically insignificant reversible laboratory abnormalities ≥ Grade 3.
2. Any toxicity that cannot recover to ≤ Grade 1 baseline level within seven days after discontinuation of dosing.
