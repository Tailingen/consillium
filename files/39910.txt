Study of Bexxar <Tositumomab> Combined With External Beam Radiation Therapy
The purpose of the study is to assess the response rate of patients with relapsed or refractory low-grade or transformed low-grade, CD20-positive, B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma to Iodine-131 (I-131) tositumomab (Bexxar) therapy plus local palliative radiation therapy (XRT).
Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin
DRUG: Bexxar (tositumomab)|PROCEDURE: External beam radiotherapy (XRT)|DRUG: Potassium Iodide (KI)
Complete Response (CR) Rate, Participants assessed for by the following Complete Response (CR) criteria

CR or Functional CR

* No evidence of disease and symptoms
* Any macroscopic nodules detected in any organs no longer present.
* Any palpable lymph node is normal and greatest diameter is \< 1.0 cm.
* The enlarged organs decreased in size and not palpable
* The bone marrow biopsy and aspirate are negative for disease
* Negative for disease by PET-scan (functional CR)

CR Unconfirmed (CRu) criteria

* No evidence of disease and symptoms
* Any lymph node mass \> 1.0 cm\^2 diameter has regressed is size by more than 75%.
* No macroscopic nodules in any organs
* Any palpable lymph node is normal and greatest diameter is \< 1.0 cm.
* The bone marrow biopsy and aspirate are negative for disease
* The bone marrow biopsy may have increased number or size of lymphoid aggregates without cytologic or architectural atypia, 12 weeks
Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is assessed as the sum of the overall rates of

* CR confirmed by positron emission tomography (PET)
* CR not confirmed by PET, and
* Partial response (PR) negative for progression by PET, 12 weeks|Time-to-Progression (TTP), 2 years
Response will be assessed on the basis of the presence or absence of measurable lesion ≥ 1.4 x 1.4 cm (operationally defined as ≥ 2.0 cm2) by radiographic evaluation OR ≥ 1.0 cm in greatest diameter detected by palpation on physical exam
