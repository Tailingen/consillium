Phase Ⅰ Clinical Study of Anti-CD52 Monoclonal Antibody in NHL and T-PLL
Phase I clinical study of multicenter, single-arm, open, non-randomized evaluation of recombinant humanized anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody in the NHL and T-PLL
Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin|Lymphoma, T-Cell
BIOLOGICAL: Recombinant Humanized Anti-CD52 Monoclonal Antibody Injection
Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by NCI-CTCAE v5.0, Adverse events that occurred during the entire study period were evaluated and graded according to NCI-CTCAE v5.0, and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) were observed.

Safety evaluation indexes include vital signs, physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram, echocardiography, clinical laboratory examination indexes (blood routine, blood biochemistry, urine routine, coagulation function, etc.), changes of ECOG physical fitness score, adverse events and serious adverse event, etc., 6 weeks
