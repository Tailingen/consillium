Second-line Regimen Combined With Radiotherapy Versus Without Radiotherapy in Patients With Locally Advanced/Oligometastatic ICC After Failure of First-line Treatmentï¼šan Open-label, Randomized, Controlled Phase II Clinical Study
Second-line regimen with or without consolidative radiotherapy in patients with oligometastatic/locally advanced unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: an open-label, randomised, controlled study.
Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma (Icc)
RADIATION: radiotherapy|DRUG: FOLFIRI or FOLFOX or Regorafenib
PFS, PFS is will be measured from the randomization to progression or death from any cause. Progression includes enlargement of target lesions and development of new distant metastases and will be assessed using RECIST 1.1., Up to 2 years
OS, OS will be the time from randomization until death from any cause., Up to 2 years|LCR, Local control of all metastases (refers to all lesions present at time of randomization) will be measured from date of randomization until progression of target lesions., Up to 2 years|AEs, Toxicity will involve treatment-related toxicity, including early and late toxicity, as assessed using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5.0. All adverse events occurring from randomization until 3 months after the end of treatment, regardless of relatedness to study medication, will be recorded as acute toxicities. Adverse events considered relevant and occurring later than 3 months after the end of treatment will be recorded as late toxicities., Up to 2 years
Second-line regimen with or without consolidative radiotherapy in patients with oligometastatic/locally advanced unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: an open-label, randomised, controlled study. Eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either second-line regimen alone (control arm) or second-line regimen plus consolidative radiotherapy to all sites of known disease (investigational arm). patients in both arms have the option of receiving upfront or subsequent standard palliative radiotherapy to any symptomatic sites requiring prompt intervention. Because of the different treatment modalities in the study, it is not possible to blind the patient or physician to the treatment arm. Follow-up for tumor assessment will conclude 52 weeks after randomization.
