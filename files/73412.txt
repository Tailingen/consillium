Biomarker in Tissue Samples From Patients With Ewing Sarcoma
RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

PURPOSE: This research trial studies biomarkers in tissue samples from patients with Ewing sarcoma.

Frequency of INI1 protein loss in Ewing Sarcoma
OBJECTIVES:

* To determine the frequency of INI-1 protein loss in Ewing Sarcoma.

OUTLINE: Previously collected tissue samples are analyzed for INI-1 protein loss by IHC and tissue microarray.
