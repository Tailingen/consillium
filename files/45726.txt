Cryotherapy in the Treatment of Desmoid Tumors
Desmoid tumor is a benign neoplasm with an unpredictable course and a high rate of local recurrence if treated surgically. Therefore, over time the surgical approach has become conservative, preferring simple observation or medical therapy in case of disease progression through the use of hormonal therapy and low-dose chemotherapy. Since this neoplasm remains benign, our study aims to avoid chemotherapy in patients usually young through the use of a minimally invasive treatment such as cryotherapy.
