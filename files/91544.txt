Cancer and Aging Resilience Evaluation in Older Adults with Hematologic Malignancies: the CARE-Heme Registry
The primary purpose of this protocol is to create a registry of older (≥50 years old) patients with Hematologic Malignancies. Our main objectives include: To understand the prevalence of frailty and geriatric impairments among patients aged ≥50y and above diagnosed with a hematologic malignancy at UAB and to gather information that would lend support for future research in this vulnerable population.

Create the CARE-Heme Registry, To establish and maintain a well-annotated registry (to be called the 'CARE-Heme' Registry) of adults ≥50 years of age with a hematologic malignancy to improve our understanding of this vulnerable population., 5 years
To administer a patient reported geriatric assessment and a brief objective physical assessment., To measure the proportion of patients with overall and domain-specific geriatric impairments, the proportion of patients with Myopenia, and the proportion of patients with frailty., 5 years
All participants will be invited to participate in a patient reported geriatric assessment questionnaire as well as an objective physical function testing. This includes the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) that evaluates lower extremity performance and muscle strength assessment via hand grip dynamometer. Participants will also complete a 12 item modified version of PRO-CTCAE. This will be administered by trained research staff at the time of study enrollment. Repeat CARE instruments (Follow-up GA questionnaire and Physical Function test) will be administered after the baseline visit to measure changes in patient reported outcomes at 3 months, 6 months, and one year. A one-time blood or saliva sample will be requested and obtained at baseline or a follow-up visit.
