Twice-daily SIB Radiotherapy Versus Standard Radiotherapy for Patients With SCLC
This trial is a multicenter, perspective, non-blinded, randomized controlled phase 3 trial. In order to establish whether the SIB technique can improve the results of twice-daily chemo-RT for patients with LS-SCLC, the investigators will primarily compare survival of patients treated with standard chemotherapy (cisplatin and etoposide) and either SIB twice-daily RT or standard dose twice-daily RT.

Three hundred and twenty-six patients with a histological or cytological proven diagnosis of SCLC will be recruited from 35 centers in 14 areas including provinces, municipalities and autonomous region, from May 2017 to May 2020.
