Microwave Ablation for Uterine Fibroids
This study is aimed to evaluate the clinical safety and effectiveness of Microwave ablation (MWA) in treating patients with uterine fibroid.
Uterine Fibroid
PROCEDURE: Microwave ablation
Assessment of technical success, Technical success was defined as successful completion of the planned treatment of target lesions, within one hour
Assessment of adverse effects and complications, Adverse effects and complications will be recorded during each treatment procedure, during each hospital admission related to the treatment, during each clinical visit at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 18 months, up to 18 months|Assessment of volume change of the fibroids, Magnetic resonance imaging will be performed at 3 and 15 month after treatment., 15 months after treatment
Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is another form of thermal ablation that has been used for the treatment of uterine fibroids. Although RFA is more invasive when compared to High-Intensity-Focused-Ultrasound (HIFU), the treatment is less limited by the location of the lesions, and the treatment procedure is more time efficient. To further improve the technology of thermal ablation for uterine fibroid, percutaneous microwave ablation (MWA) could be a promising option because it allows increased efficiency of energy transmission and reduction in procedure time, and may allow effective treatment of large lesions.
