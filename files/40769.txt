MEN-10755 in Treating Patients With Progressive Prostate Cancer That Has Not Responded to Hormone Therapy
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of MEN-10755 in treating patients who have progressive prostate cancer that has not responded to hormone therapy.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: sabarubicin
OBJECTIVES:

* Assess the activity of MEN-10755 in patients with progressive hormone-refractory adenocarcinoma of the prostate.
* Determine the rate and duration of objective PSA response in patients treated with this drug.
* Determine the clinical response rate in patients with measurable disease treated with this drug.
* Determine the acute side effects of this drug in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Beginning within 2 weeks after the last PSA measurement, patients receive MEN-10755 IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for at least 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve a complete or partial response continue to receive additional courses. Patients who achieve stable disease may receive more than 4 courses at the discretion of the investigator.

Patients are followed every 6 weeks until disease progression or initiation of a new therapy.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-32 patients will be accrued for this study.
