Imatinib Discontinuation in Patients With Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Chronic Phase With Sustained MR4log
This study will evaluate the proportion of subjects with chronic myeloid leukemia chronic phase that sustain major molecular response after imatinib discontinuation. To be eligible for this protocol, the subject must have received imatinib as first line regiment for at least 3 years with sustained molecular response of 4log (RM4log) or higher for one year.
Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase
OTHER: imatinib discontinuation
Number of subjects that remain with RM3log after imatinib discontinuation, Number of subjects that sustain BCR-ABL level below 0,1% after 24 months of follow up., 24 months
Number of subjects that recover MR3log after imatinib reintroduction, In the population that do not sustain BCR-ABL below 0,1% during the study, the time to recover the response after imatinib reintroduction will be measured, 6 months|Analysis of immunological profile of all subjects, Study of lymphocytes population by flow cytometry, including NK and T population, 24 months|Safety and tolerability of imatinib discontinuation, Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, 24 months
Patients will be followed for 2 years, with molecular monitoring, every month in the first year and then every 2 months. Imatinib will be restarted if the major molecular response (RM3log) is lost during the study or if the subject withdraw the informed consenting.

The primary objective is to measure the number of subject that sustain the major molecular response (RM3log or BCR-ABL level below 0.1%) after 2 years of follow-up.

BCR: breakpoint cluster region

ABL: abelson murine leukemia

RM3log: major molecular response, BCR-ABL level below 0.1% (IS)
