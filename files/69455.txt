Research on Effectiveness and Safety of the Treatment, Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy Combined With Tislelizumab and Targeted Therapy, That is Used for High-risk Hepatocellular Carcinoma After R0 Resection
There are limited treatment options for HCC with high recurrence risk, and there is no consistent plan for adjuvant therapy after surgery. Hence an unmet clinical need. Based on previous studies on unresectable HCC patients combined with targeted and immunotherapy, it has been found that the effect is significant, but the effect of combined with HIPEC is not clear, and no similar studies have been reported. Therefore, this project intends to carry out a single-arm clinical study on the efficacy and safety of HIPEC + tislelizumab combined with targeted therapy for high recurrence risk HCC. And observe the clinical benefits, to provide new ideas and evidence-based basis for the treatment of HCC with high recurrence risk.
