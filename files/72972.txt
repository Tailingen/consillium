A Study to Reveal the Patient Characteristics and Treatment Patterns of Stage III Non-small-cell Lung Cancer Patients
This large multinational, non-interventional study (NIS), will retrospectively collect data derived from established medical records over a period of up to approximately 6 years (2013 to 2018), building a platform to capture and consolidate information on treatment patterns, Overall Survival (OS) and treatment effectiveness outcomes in the real-world setting.
Non-small-cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
Overall survival (OS), The length of time from stage III NSCLC diagnosis (index date) or time of therapy initiation to death due to any cause., Up to 5 years
Progression-free survival (PFS), The length of time from time of therapy initiation to documented disease progression (as available in the medical record) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 5 years
Time to progression (TTP), The length of time from time of therapy initiation to disease progression (as available in the medical record)., Up to 5 years
This is multi-centre, multicountry, longitudinal cohort of patients with primary stage III NSCLC (Non-small Cell Lung Cancer), identified through the review of established patient medical records. Patients diagnosed with primary stage III NSCLC between 01 January 2013 and 31 December 2017 will be targeted for study inclusion, allowing at least 9 months of follow-up for living patients recruited at last day of the enrolment window. It is estimated that a total of approx. 2000 patients from 15-20 countries (approax.)

Patients' demographic and clinical characteristics and treatment patterns will be described. Clinical outcomes such as Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Time to Progression (TTP), Objective Response Rate (ORR) and Disease Control Rate (DCR) will be described by Line of Therapy (LOT). Overall survival will be described, where available. Healthcare resource utilisation will be described, as available from medical records.
