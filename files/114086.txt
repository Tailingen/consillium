The Association of G9a Protein and the Outcome of Patients With Cervical Cancer
G9a protein was approved to be highly associated with recurrence of breast cancer, gastric cancer, hepatocellular cancer, prostate cancer and lung cancer. Therefore, the aim of this study was to clarify the association and G9a protein and cervical cancer by analyzing the immunohistochemical staining of G9a protein to the histopathologic specimen of cervical cancer and clinical data.
Cervical Cancer
determine whether G9a protein is a risk factor of overall survival of patients with cervical cancer, From the date of primary treatment until the date of death from any cause or the date of last follow-up, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months
determine whether G9a protein is a risk factor of progression-free survival of patients with cervical cancer, From the date of primary treatment until the date of first documented progression or last follow-up, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months
