Validation of Radio-induced Damage Biomarkers
The aim of this study is to confirm in humans the relevance and the kinetics of radio-induced bio-markers in plasma and urines, previously described at the preclinical stage.

Total dose of radiation, The total dose of radiation will be calculated for each patient and compared will the biologic results., Day 3|Radiation field, The radiation field will be define for each patient and compared with the biological results., Day 3
The nuclear and radiologic risks monitoring is a major preoccupation for our society. During an accident, it is primordial to define the biologic dosimetry. The dose and distribution knowledge is crucial for the medical care. Indeed, Total Body Irradiation (TBI) and Partial Body Irradiation (PBI) do not have the same clinical outcome. A Total Body Irradiation induces an acute radiation syndrome with a Medullary Aplasia. A quick diagnostic would allow the optimization of the medical care.

Nowadays, the analyse of the chromosome with two centromeres is the current norm to estimate the radiation dose, but this technique is time consuming, and not adapted to an emergency situation, and to a large population.

The new genetic techniques could permit the quick radiation dosimetry diagnosis. The research of early exposition bio-markers seems to be of a major interest. These bio-markers would allow to rapidly define the radiations perceived by an exposed subject, before the apparition of the symptoms, and by the way, to conduct to a therapeutic strategy more adapted to the patient.

In this purpose, the present study will need blood and urines samples of patients totally or partially exposed to radiations, according to their usual medical care.
