Carboplatin/Nab-Paclitaxel and Pembrolizumab in NSCLC
This is a phase I/II study for previously untreated subjects with advanced NSCLC. The study will take place in two phases. First, a cohort of twelve participants will be enrolled in phase I part and will be treated with carboplatin, nab-paclitaxel and pembrolizumab. A cohort of twelve subjects will be evaluated for safety and tolerability after 2 cycles of therapy. All subjects who receive either nab-paclitaxel or pembrolizumab will be evaluable. If 33% of subjects or less have unacceptable toxicity in the first cohort or any subsequent cohort (if necessary), the study will proceed to the Phase II part. If more than 33% have unacceptable toxicity, 12 additional subjects will be enrolled in a second cohort, if necessary. If unacceptable toxicity is seen in more than 33% in Cohort 2, the study will end due to unacceptable toxicity of this drug combination.

The phase II part of the study is a single arm study. All subjects will be treated with carboplatin, nab-paclitaxel, and pembrolizumab in 21-day cycles for up to 4 cycles.

Mandatory pre-treatment tumor biopsies will be obtained prior to initiating treatment for all subjects (only if adequate archived samples are unavailable). Mandatory tumor biopsies will be obtained in the Phase II part of the study after 4 cycles of study treatment or at the time of progression, whichever comes first.

For subjects without progression of disease after Cycle 4, pembrolizumab will continue every 3 weeks for up to 2 years or until unacceptable toxicity.
