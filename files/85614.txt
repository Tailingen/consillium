Post-Transplant Cyclophosphamide in Patients Aged >/= 65 Years Undergoing Haploidentical Transplant
The purpose of this phase 1 study is to determine the optimal dose of the immune suppressive drug, cyclophosphamide, following standard allogeneic stem cell transplant in patients aged \>/= 65 years with hematologic malignancies.
Hematologic Malignancies
DRUG: Cyclophosphamide
Maximum grade acute GVHD by day +100 by Modified Keystone Criteria, Evaluate the frequency of grade III/IV acute GVHD using Modified Keystone Criteria, 100 days post-transplant
Time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment, Days to neutrophil and platelet engraftment since transplant, 60 days post-transplant|Non-Relapse mortality, Rate of treatment-related mortality, 100 days post-transplant|Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD) at 1 year, * Rate and severity of patients with chronic GVHD at day 365 post-transplantation.
* Chronic GVHD is when the donated stem cells attack the body after 100 days post-transplant. Chronic GVHD is defined by NIH Consensus Criteria for chronic GVHD., 1-year post-transplant|Relapse, Percentage of patients who relapse by year 1, 1-year post-transplant|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival at 1 year, 1-year post-transplant|Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD)-free and Relapse Free Survival, Percentage of patients without relapse or GVHD at 1 year, 1-year post- transplant|Change in cardiac function, Change in cardiac (heart) injury defined by any of an increase in T1 time \> 500 ms from pre-transplant imaging, T2 time \> 5 ms from pre-transplant imaging, or a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction \> 10% of the original measurement to below 53% from post-transplant imaging., From 60 days prior to transplant to 365 days post-transplant|Change in active daily living, Change in function over time as determined by Lawton Activities of Daily Living questionnaire.

- Patients will choose either 0 or 1 to rate their level of function with 1 being the highest level of function., From 60 days prior to transplant to 365 days post-transplant|Change in function, Change in function over time as determined by the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Cancer Function Brief 3-Dimensional Profile.

- Patients will rate their physical condition and fatigue using an inverse 5-item likert scale where 5 represents the highest level of function or the greatest amount of impact on function., From 60 days prior to transplant to 365 days post-transplant|Change in pain, Change in pain over time as determined by the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Cancer Function Brief 3-Dimensional Profile.

- Patients will rate their level of pain using a scale from 0 to 10 with 10 being the highest level of pain., From 60 days prior to transplant to 365 days post-transplant|Change in physical function, Change in lower limb functioning over time as evaluated by the Short Physical performance Battery. (SPPB).

- Patients will complete a series of tests evaluating balance, speed and standing capabilities. Patients will be rated using a scale of 0 to 12 where a score of less than 10 indicates mobility limitations., From 60 days prior to transplant to 365 days post-transplant|Change in grip strength, Change in grip strength as measured using the Jamar dynamometer (device used to measure grip), From 60 days prior to transplant to 365 days post-transplant|Change in cognitive function, Change in cognitive function over time using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Cognition questionnaire.

-Patients will rate their cognitive ability on a scale of 1 to 5 with 5 representing the least amount of difficulty., From 60 days prior to transplant to 365 days post-transplant|Change in mental health, Change in mental health over time using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 29 Depression Questionnaire.

- Patients will rate their level of depression on a scale of 1 to 5 with 5 representing the greatest level of depression., From 60 days prior to transplant to 365 days post-transplant
The patients will receive a standard dose, or a reduced amount of the immune suppressive drug, cyclophosphamide, that is routinely administered after the transplant procedure. The following procedures will be performed: cardiac MRI scans and/or transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE); laboratory tests, geriatric assessments and tests to measure strength and stability.

Participation in the study is expected to last up to one year with follow-up visits occurring on Day +30, Day +100, Day +180 and Day +365 following allogenic stem cell transplant.
