We enrolled 20 patients with recurrent acute myeloid leukemia after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation of RUNX1::RUNX1T1 or CBFB::MYH11 with C-KIT mutation.

The study was divided into induction therapy period and consolidation therapy period, and the study design was as follows:

A: Induction therapy period: After patients were screened and enrolled, they began to receive 1-2 cycles of induction therapy, and the specific administration regimen was as follows: Avapritinib 100mg po qd D1-D14, azacitidine 35mg/m2 ih D1-D5, Venetoclax 100mg po qd D1-D14. The 28-day cycle was followed by curative effect evaluation at the end of each cycle. Patients who achieved complete remission entered the consolidation treatment stage.

B: Consolidation therapy period: Patients who achieved complete remission after 1-2 cycles of induction therapy continued to receive avapritinib 100mg/d po. monotherapy for consolidation therapy, with a cycle of 28 days and a total of 4 cycles.
