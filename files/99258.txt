Study of the Safety and Efficacy of Elagolix in Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
This study will assess the potential impact of elagolix on disordered pituitary and ovarian hormones in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
DRUG: Elagolix|DRUG: Placebo
Percentage of Menstrual Cycle Responders, A participant was considered a menstrual cycle responder if she has at least 2 normal menstrual cycles during the final 4 months of the treatment period. In addition, a participant was considered a complete menstrual cycle responder if she has normal menstrual cycles beginning at or before Month 3 that are maintained through Month 6 during the treatment period., Week 0 (Baseline) to Week 24 (Month 6)
Change From Baseline in Area Under the Luteinizing Hormone (LH) Serum Concentration-time Curve (AUC) at Week 1, Week 0 (Baseline), Week 1: before the morning dose (0 hour) and at 0.5 (± 5 minutes), 1 (± 5 minutes), 1.5 (± 5 minutes), 2 (± 15 minutes), 2.5 (± 15 minutes), 3 (± 15 minutes), 3.5 (± 15 minutes), and 4 (± 15 minutes) hours after dosing.
This is a phase 2, multicenter, double-blind (sponsor-unblinded), randomized, placebo-controlled study to assess the safety and efficacy of elagolix in women with PCOS. PCOS is one of the most common hormonal disorders in women of reproductive age, yet few treatment options are available. This study will help determine if elagolix can impact disordered hormonal dynamics in women with PCOS and at what dosage.
