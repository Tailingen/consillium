A Study of KER-050 to Treat Anemia Due to Very Low, Low, or Intermediate Risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of KER-050 on anemia in patients with very low, low or intermediate risk MDS.
Myelodysplastic Syndromes|Cytopenia

In HTB participants, the proportion of participants having a reduction of ≥ 50% or ≥ 4 RBC units transfused compared to pretreatment over an 8-week period., Measured at multiple timepoints over the course of study from study day 1 to end of study, approximately 2 years|Incidence of progression to higher risk MDS or AML per World Health Organization 2016 criteria, Change in baseline laboratory assessments prior to treatment with KER-050 and after treatment with KER-050, Measured at multiple timepoints over the course of study from study day 1 to end of study, approximately 2 years|Incidence of progression to higher risk MDS or AML per World Health Organization 2016 criteria, Change in baseline bone marrow assessments prior to treatment with KER-050 and after treatment with KER-050, Measured at multiple timepoints over the course of study from study day 1 to end of study, approximately 2 years|Modified 2006 International Working Group (IWG) Hematologic Improvement Erythroid (HI-E) response, In LTB participants, the proportion of participants with an increase of ≥ 1.5 g/dL from pretreatment hemoglobin during any 8-week period on study compared to Baseline.

In HTB participants, the proportion of participants having a reduction by ≥ 4 units of RBCs transfused (for a hemoglobin ≤ 9.0 g/dL) during any 8-week period on study, compared with the 8-week period prior to study Cycle 1 Day 1., Measured at multiple timepoints over the course of study from study day 1 to end of study, approximately 2 years|Mean change from baseline in hemoglobin, Change in baseline hemoglobin prior to treatment with KER-050 and after treatment with KER-050, Measured at multiple timepoints over the course of study from study day 1 to end of study, approximately 2 years|Time to erythroid response and modified 2006 IWG HI-E response, Time to erythroid response prior to treatment with KER-050 and after treatment with KER-050, Measured at multiple timepoints over the course of study from study day 1 to end of study, approximately 2 years|Duration of erythroid response and modified 2006 IWG HI-E response, Duration of erythroid response prior to treatment with KER-050 and after treatment with KER-050, Measured at multiple timepoints over the course of study from study day 1 to end of study, approximately 2 years|Frequency of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions and rate of RBC transfusion independence ≥ 8 weeks, Frequency and rate of RBC transfusions prior to treatment with KER-050 and after treatment with KER-050, Measured at multiple timepoints over the course of study from study day 1 to end of study, approximately 2 years|Change from Baseline in RBC counts and reticulocytes, Change in baseline RBC counts and reticulocytes prior to treatment with KER-050 and after treatment with KER-050, Measured at multiple timepoints over the course of study from study day 1 to end of study, approximately 2 years
KER-050 is a therapeutic protein designed to increase red blood cell and platelet production by inhibiting the signaling of a subset of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-ß) family of proteins to promote hematopoiesis. It is being developed for the treatment of low blood cell counts, or cytopenias including anemia and thrombocytopenia in patients with Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) and Myelofibrosis (MF).
