Enhanced Supportive Care for Advanced Cancer Patients: Evaluation of Standardized Care Pathway
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the standardized care pathway which provides enhanced supportive care for patients with advanced cancer.

A pilot study (single arm pre-post test) will be conducted to evaluate feasibility of applying standardized care pathway to provide enhanced supportive care. A Randomized Controlled Trial will be conducted by randomly allocating participants in a 1:1 ratio to intervention arm (receiving enhanced supportive care according to the standardized care pathway) or control arm (receiving usual care: symptom monitoring only). Participants in the intervention arm will receive enhanced supportive care consisted of symptom management and coping enhancement counseling for 5 times. Data from advanced cancer patients will be collected at baseline (before start of chemotherapy), during chemotherapy (intervention arm), at the visit for cycle 5 of chemotherapy, at 6 month, and at 12 month Data from caregivers will be collected at baseline, 3 month, and 6 month. Primary outcomes will be measured as advanced cancer patients' symptom, coping and quality of life.
Advanced Cancer
OTHER: Enhanced supportive care based on standardized care pathway|OTHER: Control group with usual care
Symptom measured by the ESAS (Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale + 5 additional symptoms), at the visit for cycle 5 (each cycle is from 2 weeks to 4 weeks depending on chemotherapy regimen) of chemotherapy (at average 3 month)|Coping measured by brief COPE, at the visit for cycle 5 of chemotherapy (at average 3 month)|Quality of life measured by the EORTC QLQ C-30, at the visit for cycle 5 of chemotherapy (at average 3 month)
