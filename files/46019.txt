Identification of Metabolic Phenotypes Associated With Melanoma Metastasis
The goal of this study is to observe metabolic features associated with human melanoma tumors.
Melanoma (Skin)
Glucose Utilisation in the TCA cycle, In patients receiving a \[U-13C\]Glucose infusion, assess glucose utilization in the TCA cycle by melanoma tumors (defined as fractional enrichment of 13C-label in TCA metabolites), 5 years
Relapse free survival, Defined as the time from surgery to disease recurrence or melanoma-related death, whichever occurs first, 5 years|Overall Survival, Measured as the time of surgery until death from any cause, 5 years|Development of Lymph Node or Distant Metastasis, Defined as yes/no for each type of metastasis, 5 years
Tumor Metabolomic and Lipidomic Profiling, Abundance of metabolites and lipid species, quantified by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, 5 years
This is a single center, correlative study designed to assess metabolic features of melanoma tumors in patients. The study will involve the collection of melanoma tissue at the time of surgical biopsy or excision. All samples will be assessed by mass spectrometry for metabolomic analysis. A subset of patients will have received \[U-13C\]glucose infusions which will be utilized for isotope tracing metabolic analysis. Relevant clinical data (eg survival, metastasis) will be correlated with metabolic findings.
