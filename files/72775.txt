MR Radiomic Features in Prostate Cancer
A combination of correct interpretation of imaging and biopsy has given promising results in terms of detecting clinically significant cancer at radical prostatectomy.

Quantitative approaches to medical image analysis have been developed in recent years with the aim to overcome the limitation of qualitative image interpretation, and provide biomarkers for disease characterization. In particular, the new paradigm, "radiomics", is emerging as the high-throughput extraction of quantitative features from imaging which can aid in characterizing phenotype as in vivo expression of tumoral genotype. The goal of radiomics is to extract accurate and reliable quantitative biomarkers which enhance diagnostic confidence in oncology.
