Ph 2 Open Label Study of GC4419 to Reduce SOM Associated With Chemoradiotherapy for Head and Neck Cancer
GTI-4419-202 is a Phase 2 open-label study of the effects of GC4419 (IV) when administered in combination with IMRT and cisplatin to up to subjects with head and neck cancer, who are at high risk for Severe Oral Mucositis (SOM)
Head and Neck Cancer|Oral Mucositis
DRUG: Drug: GC4419|RADIATION: Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT)|DRUG: Cisplatin
Incidence of Treatment Emergent AE's, Number of Subjects with at Least One Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE), First dose of study medication through the 30 days following the last dose of IMRT, GC4419, or cisplatin (whichever occurs last) which is estimated to be 11 weeks
Cumulative Incidence of Severe OM, Cumulative Incidence of WHO Grade 3-4 from the start of IMRT through the end of the study treatment period (last day of IMRT), From start of Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) through approximately 30 fractions which is estimated to be 6-7 weeks.
Subjects will receive 90 mg GC4419 per day (60 min IV infusion to complete within 60 minutes prior to IMRT), concurrent with daily fractions of IMRT (2.0-2.2 Gy) to a total of 60-72 Gy over approximately 7 weeks, plus cisplatin administered 100 mg/m2 once every three weeks for 3 doses or 40 mg/m2 once weekly for 6-7 doses (Investigator's choice).

All subjects will be assessed twice weekly for Oral Mucositis (OM) per WHO grading criteria until 28 days post end of study treatment period (last day of IMRT).
