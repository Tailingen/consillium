A Study of Loncastuximab Tesirine and Rituximab (Lonca-R) in Previously Untreated Unfit/Frail Participants With Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)
The main objective of the trial is to assess the efficacy and tolerability of Lonca-R in unfit and frail participants with previously untreated DLBCL.
Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Loncastuximab Tesirine|DRUG: Rituximab
CR Rate, Defined as percentage of participants with a best overall response (BOR) of CR as determined by the Investigator according to the 2014 Lugano Classification criteria.

CR was defined as achieving:

* Complete metabolic response for positron emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT) OR
* Complete radiologic response (target node regress to \<1.5 cm, no non-measured lesions, no organ enlargement, no new lesions and normal bone marrow morphology) for CT if disease was not fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid at baseline., Up to a maximum of 17.1 months|Cohort B: Percentage of Participants Who Completed 4 Cycles of Treatment, Defined by the number of participants who completed a total of 4 cycles of therapy divided by the total number of participants \* 100., Up to 12 weeks (3 week cycle length)
Overall Response Rate (ORR), Defined as the percentage of participants who achieved either CR or PR as BOR as determined by Investigator according to the 2014 Lugano Classification criteria.

CR was defined as achieving:

* Complete metabolic response for PET-CT OR
* Complete radiologic response (target node regress to \<1.5 cm, no non-measured lesions, no organ enlargement, no new lesions and normal bone marrow morphology) for CT if disease was not FDG-avid at baseline.

PR was defined as achieving:

* Partial metabolic response (findings indicate residual disease) for PET-CT OR
* Partial remission (\>50% decrease in target measurable nodes, regression/ absence/ no increase of non-measured lesions, spleen regressed by \>50% in length and no new lesions) for CT if disease was not FDG-avid at baseline., Up to a maximum of 17.1 months|2-year Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from first dose of study drug until the first date of either disease progression (PD) or death due to any cause. The 2-year PFS was defined as the percentage of participants that were PFS event-free at 2 years per investigator assessment with 95% confidence interval (CI) estimated using Kaplan-Meier method., 2 years|3-year Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from randomization date until death due to any cause. The 3-year OS was defined as the percentage of participants that were OS event-free at 3 years with 95% CI estimated using Kaplan-Meier method., 3 years|Duration of Response (DoR), Defined for participants with CR or PR only as the interval between the date of initial documentation of a response and the date of the first documented progressive disease (based on radiographic or clinical progression at end of study or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first) per investigator assessment with 95% CI estimated using Kaplan-Meier method.

CR was defined as achieving:

* Complete metabolic response for PET-CT OR
* Complete radiologic response (target node regress to \<1.5 cm, no non-measured lesions, no organ enlargement, no new lesions and normal bone marrow morphology) for CT if disease was not FDG-avid at baseline.

PR was defined as achieving:

* Partial metabolic response (findings indicate residual disease) for PET-CT OR
* Partial remission (\>50% decrease in target measurable nodes, regression/ absence/ no increase of non-measured lesions, spleen regressed by \>50% in length and no new lesions) for CT if disease was not FDG-avid at baseline., Up to a maximum of 17.1 months|Number of Participants Who Experienced a Treatment-emergent Adverse Event (TEAE), An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product. A TEAE was defined as an AE that occurred or worsened in the period extending from the first dose of study drug to 15 weeks after the last dose of study drugs in this study or start of a new anticancer therapy, whichever was earlier. A serious AE (SAE) was defined as an AE that resulted in death, was life threatening, required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, was a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or an important medical event. A severe AE was defined as Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0 Grade 3 (severe) or above.

Clinically significant changes in safety laboratory variables, vital signs, physical examinations, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score were recorded as AEs., Up to approximately 8 months|Maximum Observed Concentration (Cmax) of Conjugated Antibody, Pharmacokinetic (PK) was assessed by a central laboratory using validated bioanalytical methods. Analysis considered model development for conjugated antibodies and total antibodies only, as pre-specified in protocol section 9.9., Cycle 1 Day 2: predose (preferably within 2 h prior to start of infusion) and at the end (within -5 to +10 min) of loncastuximab tesirine infusion; Cycles 2-6 Day 1 predose and at the end of loncastuximab tesirine infusion (3 week cycle length)|Cmax of Total Antibody, PK was assessed by a central laboratory using validated bioanalytical methods. Analysis considered model development for conjugated antibodies and total antibodies only, as pre-specified in protocol section 9.9., Cycle 1 Day 2: predose (preferably within 2 h prior to start of infusion) and at the end (within -5 to +10 min) of loncastuximab tesirine infusion; Cycles 2-6 Day 1 predose and at the end of loncastuximab tesirine infusion (3 week cycle length)|Trough Concentration (Ctrough) of Conjugated Antibody, PK was assessed by a central laboratory using validated bioanalytical methods. Analysis considered model development for conjugated antibodies and total antibodies only, as pre-specified in protocol section 9.9., Cycle 1 Day 2: predose (preferably within 2 h prior to start of infusion); Cycles 2-6 Day 1 predose (3 week cycle length)|Ctrough of Total Antibody, PK was assessed by a central laboratory using validated bioanalytical methods. Analysis considered model development for conjugated antibodies and total antibodies only, as pre-specified in protocol section 9.9., Cycle 1 Day 2: predose (preferably within 2 h prior to start of infusion); Cycles 2-6 Day 1 predose (3 week cycle length)|Number of Participants With Confirmed Positive Anti-Drug Antibody (ADA) Response, Detection of ADAs against loncastuximab tesirine was performed by using a screening assay for identification of antibody positive samples/participants and a confirmation assay. A participant was considered to have an ADA response if ADA sample was positive at any pre-specified, post-treatment timepoint., Cycle 1 Day 2 pre-dose (preferably within 2 h prior to start of infusion) then Day 1 pre-dose of Cycles 2, 4, and 6 (3 week cycle length)|Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lymphoma (FACT-Lym) Subscale and Composite Scores, The following score ranges were possible for the FACT-Lym subscale and composite scores, with higher scores indicating better quality of life/outcome: 0 to 28 for physical well-being, social/family well-being, and functional well-being; 0 to 24 for emotional well-being; 0 to 60 for lymphoma subscale score; 0 to 116 for FACT-Lym trial outcome index; 0 to 108 for FACT-G total score; and 0 to 168 for FACT-Lym Total. An increase in subscale/composite scores from Baseline indicated better quality of life/outcome., Baseline and End of Treatment Visit (a maximum of 19 weeks)
The primary objectives of this trial are shown below:

Cohort A: To assess the efficacy of a response-adapted treatment of Lonca-R in unfit participants with previously untreated DLBCL, high-grade B cell lymphoma (HGBCL), or Grade 3b follicular lymphoma (FL).

Cohort B: To assess the tolerability and efficacy of a response-adapted treatment of Lonca-R in frail participants with previously untreated DLBCL, or HGBCL, or Grade 3b FL who are ineligible for standard R-mini-CHOP.

The simplified geriatric assessment (sGA) developed by the Fondazione Italiana Linfomi (FIL) identifies three distinct categories (fit, unfit, and frail) based on age, activities of daily living (ADL), instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) and the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale for Geriatrics (CIRS-G). Participants will be assigned to Cohort A (unfit) or B (frail) using the sGA.
