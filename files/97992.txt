This study aims to assess whether follow-up calls can increase the return rate of mailed FIT Kits. Patients ages 45 to 59 due for colorectal cancer screening, who had not received a FIT Kit in the previous 3 months but had completed one sometime in the past and had an assigned primary care provider, were sent a FIT Kit in October of 2024. Half of patients were randomized to receive a follow-up call reminding the patient to return the FIT Kit. This work analyzes the return rate of the mailed FIT Kit, with or without phone call follow-up.
