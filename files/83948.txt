Almost 90% of cancer patients suffer from symptoms of fatigue during treatment. Supporting treatments are increasingly used to alleviate the burden of fatigue. This study examines the short-term effects of yoga on fatigue, depression and quality of life. The aim of this study will evaluate the efficacy of yoga for cancer patients with mixed diagnoses reporting fatigue. We will randomly allocate 124 patients to an intervention group (N=62) receiving yoga and a wait-list control group (N=62) receiving yoga 9 weeks later. The yoga therapy will be performed in weekly sessions of 60 minutes each for 8 weeks. The primary outcome will be self-reported fatigue symptoms. Secondary outcome will be depression and Quality of life
