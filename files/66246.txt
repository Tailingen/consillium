Electronic Patient Reporting of Symptoms During Cancer Treatment
The current study is designed to test nationally whether patients' outcomes and utilization of services can be improved through symptom monitoring via patient-reported outcomes between visits.
Metastatic Cancer
OTHER: Patient Self-Reporting of Symptoms|OTHER: Usual Care Delivery
Overall Survival, Unadjusted Kaplan-Meier estimated survival, based on administrative datasets and practice self-report/medical records., 24 months
Physical Functioning, Physical functioning was measured at the 3 month time point using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 questionnaire. The QLQ-C30 is a widely used 30 item questionnaire with excellent measurement properties. Physical functioning was assessed via 5 items from the QLQ-C30 which generated a single score on a 0-100 point scale (higher scores are better).

Mean changes from baseline were measured using the QLQ-C30 at 3 months and compared between arms with a linear combination of parameters from a general linear mixed model. Patients who completed the QLQ C30 at baseline and each follow up time point were categorized as improved on each outcome if their score increased by \>/=5 points from baseline; worse if their score decreased by \>/=5 points and otherwise as stable., Month 3|Symptom Control, Symptom control was measured at the 3 month time point using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 questionnaire. The QLQ-C30 is a widely used 30 item questionnaire with excellent measurement properties. Symptom control was assessed as a composite of 8 QLQ-C30 symptom scale scores on a 0-100 point scale (higher scores are better).

Mean changes from baseline were measured using the QLQ-C30 at 3 months and compared between arms with a linear combination of parameters from a general linear mixed model. Patients who completed the QLQ C30 at baseline and each follow up time point were categorized as improved on each outcome if their score increased by \>/=5 points from baseline; worse if their score decreased by \>/=5 points and otherwise as stable., Month 3|Health-related Quality of Life, Health-related quality of life was measured at the 3 month time point using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 questionnaire. The QLQ-C30 is a widely used 30 item questionnaire with excellent measurement properties. Health-related quality of life was assessed as a composite of function and symptom scale scores on a 0-100 point scale (higher scores are better).

Mean changes from baseline were measured using the QLQ-C30 at 3 months and compared between arms with a linear combination of parameters from a general linear mixed model. Patients who completed the QLQ C30 at baseline and each follow up time point were categorized as improved on each outcome if their score increased by \>/=5 points from baseline; worse if their score decreased by \>/=5 points and otherwise as stable., Month 3|Patient Satisfaction/Communication, Patients in the ePRO arm were measured via Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire assessing comprehension of ePRO questions, usability of digital ePRO system, meaningfulness/relevance of ePRO questions, communication/actionability with care team, clinical utility of ePRO system and patient self efficacy. The number of patients analyzed is the number of patients who completed the questions. Some questions were not administered to all patients., Month 3|Emergency Department Utilization, Data for emergency department visits were obtained from data abstracted at each practice from the electronic medical record., 1 year
This is a cluster RCT at approximately 50 sites where randomization will occur in a 1:1 ratio at the site level (not at the individual patient level). Therefore, approximately 25 sites will be randomized to the PRO-TECT intervention arm (patient-reporting of symptoms), and approximately 25 sites will be randomized to the control arm (usual care delivery). Approximately 1200 patients will be enrolled. Specifically:

PROCEDURES AT ALL SITES (CONTROL SITES AND INTERVENTION SITES):

* Site staff (CRA and Nurse Champion required) will attend the site initiation webinar with UNC staff, including training for the PRO-Core online data management system and orientation to the symptom management guidelines.
* At enrollment, all participants will be given a booklet with patient-level symptom advice and a link to the content online.
* All participants will receive compensation for participation, mailed to them as gift cards by UNC.
* CRAs will train all participants how to complete outcomes questionnaires for the trial using the PRO-Core online system. Participants will be given a choice to complete these in clinic or from home online, or if necessary via paper in clinic (with the CRA entering the data into PRO-Core). If the patient does not self-complete this information, the CRA will contact them to collect the information and then enter it into PRO-Core. The outcomes questionnaires will be completed at baseline; and at month 1 (+/- 2 weeks); and at months 3, 6, 9, and 12/off-study (+/- 4 weeks each), and will be available in English, Spanish, or Mandarin Chinese. At each time point, the CRA will contact the participant to remind them about the upcoming questionnaire and offer help.
* Chart abstraction will be conducted by CRAs at baseline and at off-study for each participant, with data entered into the PRO-Core system. Date of death information will additionally be abstracted at 18 and 24 months, and possibly later per the UNC study team.
* CRAs will be asked to complete a feedback survey (entered by the CRA into the PRO-Core online system) and may be asked to participate in a brief telephone debriefing and/or site visit.
* Accrual will be monitored in a weekly teleconference between the UNC team and site CRAs.

ADDITIONAL PROCEDURES AT INTERVENTION SITES ONLY:

* At baseline, CRAs will also train patients to self-report symptoms and physical functioning using the PRO-Core system weekly for up to a year, with a choice to do this online or via an automated telephone system (patient choice), and a choice of English, Spanish, or Mandarin Chinese.
* Whenever a concerning symptom is reported, an automated "email alert" notification will be sent to the site CRA. The CRA will forward the email alert to the responsible clinical nurse (or other covering clinician) and CC the site's Nurse Champion. Within 72 hours, the CRA will document what action(s), if any, were taken by the nurse in response to the alert (entered by the CRA into a form in the PRO-Core system).
* A symptom report will be printed/generated by the site CRA whenever the patient has a clinic visit, and will be given to the oncologist and nurse caring for the patient.
