Diagnostic Study of Gene Alterations in Children Who Have Been Treated for Relapsed Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia
RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as genetic testing, may improve the ability to detect acute lymphocytic leukemia and determine the extent of disease.

PURPOSE: Diagnostic study to try to detect changes in the genes of children who have been treated for relapsed acute lymphocytic leukemia.
Leukemia
OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the incidence of p16/p15 homozygous deletions and p15 promoter hypermethylation in acute lymphocytic leukemia cells of children treated on protocol CCG-1941.
* Determine the prognostic importance of p16/p15 abnormalities in these children.
* Determine the presence or absence of p16/p15 abnormalities in the dominant clone at diagnosis if present at relapse in these patients.

OUTLINE: Frozen cells are obtained from samples collected on protocol CCG-1941. DNA is isolated and examined using Southern blot analysis to assay for deletions and promoter hypermethylation of p16 and/or p15.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 100 samples will be obtained for this study.
