RD13-02 for Patients With r/r CD7+ T Cell Hematologic Malignancies
This is a single-arm, open-label, single-center, phase I study. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety of CD7 CAR-T therapy for patients with CD7-positive relapsed or refractory T-ALL/LBL, and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of CD7 CAR-T in patients.
