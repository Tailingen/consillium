Cardiac Management of Patients With Thalassemia Minor and Breast Cancer
This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the demographic characteristics, clinical conditions in term of physical examination findings), functional status, and laboratory results of patients with thalassemia minor (TM) and breast cancer (BC) in order to identify any differences between the group with BC only.

Available data as anticancer treatment, comorbidities, weight and height will be combined to report body mass index (BMI) in kg/m2, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, ECG, transthoracic echocardiography, blood count, lipid panels, glucose, kidney function tests, (N terminal) NT-proBNP, troponins, handgrip assessments, functional status were extracted from patients files and hospital electronic archives.

Incidence of any rise in troponin, Troponin results from baseline and at 3, 6 and 12 months of cancer treatment ., From enrollment to 12 months|Incidence of any rise in NT-ProBNP, NT-ProBNP results from baseline and at 3, 6 and 12 months of cancer treatment ., From enrollment to 12 months|Incidence of any reduction in LV, Echocardiographic measurements of Left ventricle (LV) ejection fraction from baseline and at 3, 6 and 12 months of cancer treatment., From enrollment to 12 months
Following data was extracted from files and hospital electronic records, and will be evaluated (at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months):

1. Physical examination findings (as pretibial edema, jugular venous distension, lung rales),
2. Clinically significant changes in cardiac function as determined by Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) measurements using transthoracic echocardiography,
3. Any changes in (N terminal) NT-ProBNP and troponin,
4. Any changes in manual handgrip measurements for both hands using hydraulic hand dynamometer,
5. Applied medications,

were extracted and will be evaluated.
