Neoadjuvant Intense Endocrine Therapy for High Risk and Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer
This is a prospective, multicenter, multi-arm, non-randomized, open-label clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant intense endocrine therapy for high-risk or locally advanced prostate cancer.

All grades of adverse events will be documented., up to 5 years
The study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of different forms of neoadjuvant intense androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) compared with ADT alone, followed by prostatectomy.
