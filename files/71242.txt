Study of HPN536 in Patients With Advanced Cancers Associated With Mesothelin Expression
An open-label, Phase 1/2a study of HPN536 as monotherapy to assess the safety, tolerability and PK in patients with advanced cancers associated with mesothelin expression.(Phase 2 portion of the study was not conducted.)
