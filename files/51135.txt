Safety and Efficacy Clinical Study of SNS-595 in Patients With Advanced Small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the objective tumor response rate to SNS-595 in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC).
Carcinoma, Small Cell|Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: SNS-595
Objective Response Rate, Objective tumor response rate based on the RECIST criteria for target lesions as assessed by CT or MRI: Complete Response (CR), disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD; Progressive Disease (PD), at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD), Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD. Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR, up to 6 months
Best Overall Response, The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started), classified as CR, PR, SD or PD per RECIST criteria., upto 6 months
Other objectives of this study are to assess the safety, survival rate, best response, time to disease progression, duration of tumor response, and to explore several potential biomarkers to see how these levels change after administration of SNS-595.
