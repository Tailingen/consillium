Incidence and Mortality
Estimated new cases and deaths from breast cancer (men only)  in the United States in 2025:[
1
]
New cases: 2,800.
Deaths: 510.
Male breast cancer is rare.[
2
]  Fewer than 1% of all breast carcinomas occur in
men.[
3
,
4
]  The mean age at diagnosis is between 60 and 70 years; however, men of all
ages can be affected by the disease.
Anatomy
Enlarge
Anatomy of the male breast. The nipple and areola are shown on the outside of the breast. The lymph nodes, fatty tissue, ducts, and other parts of the inside of the breast are also shown.
Risk Factors
Predisposing risk factors for male breast cancer appear to include:[
5
,
6
]
Radiation exposure to breast/chest.
Estrogen
use.
Diseases associated with hyperestrogenism, such as
cirrhosis or Klinefelter syndrome.
Family health history: Definite familial
tendencies are evident, with an increased incidence seen in men who have a number of female
relatives with breast cancer.
Major inheritance susceptibility: Increased male breast cancer risk has been
reported in families with
BRCA
pathogenic variants, although risk appears to be higher with inherited
BRCA2
variants than with
BRCA1
variants.[
7
,
8
]  At age 70 years,  men have an estimated cumulative breast cancer risk of 1.2% if they have
BRCA1
pathogenic variants and 6.8% if they have
BRCA2
pathogenic variants.[
9
]  Other genes may be involved in male breast cancer predisposition, including pathogenic variants in the
PTEN
tumor suppressor gene,
TP53
(Li-Fraumeni syndrome),
PALB2
, and in mismatch repair genes associated with Lynch syndrome (also called hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer).[

and
BRCA2
: Cancer Risks and Management.
Clinical Features
Most breast cancers in men present with a retroareolar mass.  Other signs include:
Nipple retraction.
Bleeding from the nipple.
Skin ulceration.
Peau d’orange.
Palpable axillary adenopathy.
Because of delays in diagnosis, breast cancer in men is more likely to present at an advanced stage.[
2
,
5
,
13
]
Diagnostic Evaluation
Breast imaging should be performed when  breast cancer is suspected.  The American College of Radiology recommends ultrasonography as the first imaging modality in men younger than 25 years because breast cancer is highly unlikely. Mammography is performed if ultrasonography findings are suspicious.
For men aged 25 years or older, or  those who have a highly concerning physical examination, mammography is recommended as the initial test and ultrasonography is useful if mammography is inconclusive or suspicious.[
14
] Suspicious findings should be confirmed with a core biopsy. If the presence of tumor is confirmed, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor type 2 (HER2) expression/amplification should be evaluated.[
15
]
For more information, see the
Diagnosis
section in Breast Cancer Treatment.
Histopathologic Classification
Infiltrating
ductal cancer is the most common tumor type of breast cancer in men, while invasive lobular carcinoma is very rare.[
16
] Breast cancer in men is almost always hormone receptor positive. In a male breast cancer series, 99% of the tumors were estrogen receptor positive, 82% were progesterone receptor positive, 9% were HER2 positive, and 0.3% were triple negative.[
16
]
Prognosis and Predictive Factors
Tumor size, lymph node involvement, and grade are anatomical prognostic factors, while estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2 status are predictive of response to therapy.
A more advanced stage at diagnosis confers a worse prognosis for men with breast cancer.[
2
,
5
,
13
] A study found that mortality after breast cancer diagnosis was higher in male patients than in female patients. This disparity appeared to persist after accounting for clinical characteristics, treatment factors, and access to care, suggesting that biological factors and treatment efficacy may play a role.[

Stage Information for Male Breast Cancer
Staging for male breast cancer
is identical to staging for female breast cancer.  For more information, see the
TNM Definitions
section in Breast Cancer Treatment.
Treatment Option Overview for Male Breast Cancer
The approach to the treatment of men with breast cancer is similar to that for women.  Because male breast cancer is rare, there is a lack of randomized data to support specific treatment modalities.  Treatment options for men with breast cancer are described in
Table 1
.
Table 1.  Treatment Options for Male Breast Cancer
Stage (
TNM Definitions
)
Treatment Options
T = primary tumor; N = regional lymph node; M = distant metastasis; GnRH = gonadotropin-releasing hormone.
Early/localized/operable male breast cancer
Surgery with or without radiation therapy
Adjuvant therapy
Locally advanced male breast cancer
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy
Surgical excision
Radiation therapy and endocrine therapy
Metastatic male breast cancer
Aromatase inhibitor therapy in conjunction with a GnRH agonist
Treatment of Early/Localized/Operable Male Breast Cancer
In This Section
Surgery With or Without Radiation Therapy
Adjuvant Therapy
Current Clinical Trials
As in women, treatment options for men with early-stage breast cancer include:
Surgery with or without radiation therapy
(locoregional therapy).
Adjuvant therapy
(systemic therapy).
Chemotherapy.
Endocrine therapy.
Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)–directed therapy.
Surgery With or Without Radiation Therapy
Primary treatment is a mastectomy with axillary
lymph node dissection.[
1
-
3
] Responses in men are generally similar to those seen in women with breast cancer.[
2
] Breast conservation surgery with lumpectomy and radiation therapy has also been used and can be offered if standard criteria for breast conservation therapy are met. Results in men have been similar to those seen in women with breast cancer.[
4
]
For more information, see the
Surgical Treatment for Breast Cancer
section in Breast Cancer Treatment.
Adjuvant Therapy
The optimal systemic treatment in men with breast cancer has not been studied in randomized clinical trials. Adjuvant therapy should be administered according to the same criteria used for women. Adjuvant therapies used to treat early/localized/operable male breast cancer are outlined in
Table 2
. For more information, see the
Systemic Therapy for Stages I, II, and III Breast Cancer
section in Breast Cancer Treatment.
Table 2.  Adjuvant Therapy Used to Treat Early/Localized/Operable Male Breast Cancer
Type of Adjuvant Therapy
Agents Used
HER2 = human epidermal growth factor receptor 2; LHRH = luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone.
Chemotherapy
Docetaxel and cyclophosphamide
Doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide with or without paclitaxel
Endocrine therapy
Tamoxifen [
5
]
Aromatase inhibitors with LHRH agonist [
5
-
9
]
HER2-directed therapy
Trastuzumab [
1
,
5
]
Pertuzumab
Tamoxifen
Evidence (tamoxifen):
A retrospective analysis of 257 men with stage I to stage III breast cancer included 50 men who were treated with an aromatase inhibitor (AI) and 207 men who were treated with tamoxifen.[
10
]
With a median follow-up of 42 months, treatment with an AI was associated with a higher risk of death compared with tamoxifen (32% with AI vs. 18% with tamoxifen; hazard ratio, 1.55; 95% confidence interval, 1.13–2.13).
In men with contraindications for tamoxifen, single-agent AI therapy is not recommended.  AIs should be combined with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues.[
6
]
In male breast cancer patients, tamoxifen
use is associated with a high rate of treatment-limiting symptoms such as hot
flashes and impotence.[
11
]
The German Breast Group conducted a randomized phase II clinical trial (
NCT01638247
) of tamoxifen 
with or without a GnRH analogue versus AI plus a GnRH 
analogue in men with early-stage, hormone receptor–positive breast cancer. Results of this trial are 
pending.

Treatment of Locally Advanced Male Breast Cancer
In This Section
Current Clinical Trials
Treatment options for men with locally advanced breast cancer include:[
1
]
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Surgical excision.
Radiation therapy and endocrine therapy.
The decisions regarding the order and choice of treatments in men are guided by the same principles used for the treatment of breast cancer in women (in particular, evaluation of pathological response).[

Treatment of Metastatic Male Breast Cancer
In This Section
Current Clinical Trials
Treatment options for men with metastatic breast cancer include:
Aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy in conjunction with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist.
The management of metastatic hormone receptor–positive male breast cancer relies on the same treatment options used in women. However, data regarding the activity of AIs with GnRH agonists and fulvestrant in men are limited to case series.[
1
-
4
] The administration of an AI in conjunction with a GnRH agonist is recommended on the basis of the adjuvant data. There are no data comparing the activity of fulvestrant alone with fulvestrant in combination with a GnRH agonist.
Based on real world data and limited studies, it is reasonable to extrapolate the use of additional treatment options for men. These treatment options include cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitors, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitors, used in combination with endocrine therapy.
The use of chemotherapy, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors in men with metastatic breast cancer is guided by similar treatment principles as in women.[
