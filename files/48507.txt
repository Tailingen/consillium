A Study of PLX51107 in Advanced Malignancies
The purpose of this research study is to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of the investigational drug PLX51107 in subjects with advanced solid tumors (including lymphoma), and advanced hematological malignancies
