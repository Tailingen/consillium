Assess Diversity of Gut Microbiome in Met NSCLC in Correlation to Tx & Adverse Effects
This is a pilot study collecting data on the diversity and composition of gut microbiomes in subjects with advanced/metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) while receiving treatment for NSCLC.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Microbiome
