CD19/CD20 Dual-CAR-T in B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma Patients.
This is a single center, single arm, open-label, phase I study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CD19/CD20 Dual-CAR-T cells in patients with refractory or relapsed B-NHL.
B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: CD19/CD20 Dual-CAR-T cells
Percentage of adverse events, Percentage of participants with adverse events., 6months|Objective remission rate(ORR), The percentage of participants who achieved complete remission (CR) and partial remission over all participants., 6 months
Relapse-Free Survival(RFS ), 6 months|Overall-Survival(OS), 6 months

This Phase I study is designed as a pilot trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of CD19/CD20 Dual-CAR-T cell therapy in subjects with refractory and relapsed B-NHL. Subjects will receive cytoreductive chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine on days -5, -4 and -3 followed by infusion of CD19/CD20 Dual-CAR-T cells. Safety and efficacy of CD19/CD20 Dual-CAR-T cells therapy will be monitored. The purpose of current study is to determine the clinical efficacy and safety of CD19/CD20 Dual-CAR-T cells therapy in patients with refractory and relapsed B-NHL.
