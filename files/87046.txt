CD8 Minibody Repeatability Study
Zr-89 crefmirlimab berdoxam is a Zirconium-89 labelled minibody developed by ImaginAb for full body PET imaging of CD8+ cell distribution (CD8 ImmunoPET). The primary objective of this study is to assess the test-retest repeatability of CD8 immunoPET imaging in oncology patients with stable disease.
