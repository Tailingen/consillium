A Safety and Efficacy Study of Treatment Combinations With and Without Chemotherapy in Adult Participants With Advanced Upper Gastrointestinal Tract Malignancies
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and preliminary clinical activity of treatment combinations with and without chemotherapy in participants with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic gastric, GEJ, and esophageal adenocarcinoma. Chemotherapy will consist of FOLFOX (oxaliplatin, leucovorin, fluorouracil).
