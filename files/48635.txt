An Open-label Study to Investigate the Clinical Efficacy of Different Dosing Regimens of Efgartigimod IV in Patients With Generalized Myasthenia Gravis
The purpose of this open-label study is to investigate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of a continuous regimen of efgartigimod compared with a cyclic regimen in participants with Generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG).

Study details include:

The study duration will be up to 138 weeks (including screening and a safety follow-up of up to 9 weeks)

* Part A (regimen comparison period) - 21 weeks
* Part B (extension period) - up to 105 weeks

The visit frequency, including virtual visits, will be weekly through Week 21 and every 5 weeks for the remainder of the study.
