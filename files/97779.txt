Conditioning regimen with double alkylating agents such as busulfan + melphalan or Busulfan + thiotepa have been shown to improve the transplantation outcome in terms of lower relapse rate in various myeloid malignancies. In this multiple-center phase II study, the aim is to evaluate the clinical outcome of reduced intensity conditioning regimen with fludarabine (150mg/m2), busulfan (6.4mg/kg) and melphalan (100mg/m2) in patients with myeloid malignancies including AML, MDS and CMML \>=55 years.
