Combination Chemotherapy of Gemcitabine and Paclitaxel for Metastatic Breast Cancer
To investigate efficacy, safety and PK of gemcitabine and paclitaxel combination in patients with metastatic breast cancer after adjuvant/neo-adjuvant chemotherapy with anthracycline regimen
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: gemcitabine|DRUG: paclitaxel
Tumor Response, Best response recorded from the start of treatment until disease progression/recurrence using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria that defines when participants improve ("respond"), stay the same ("stable"), or worsen ("progression") during treatment. Responders are patients with complete response or partial response., baseline to measured progressive disease
Duration of Response, The duration of a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) was defined as the time from first objective status assessment of CR or PR to the first time of progression or death as a result of any cause., time of response to progressive disease|Time to Progressive Disease, Defined as the time from study enrollment to the first date of disease progression. Time to disease progression was censored at the date of death if death was due to other cause., baseline to measured progressive disease|Number of Participants Alive at One Year (1-Year Survival), baseline to date of death from any cause, evaluated at 1 year|Pharmacokinetics - Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Maximum plasma concentration of gemcitabine plus paclitaxel on Day 1, Cycle 1, and gemcitabine monotherapy on Day 8, Cycle 1., cycle 1, day 1 (0 minutes, 3, 3.25, 3.5, 3.58, 3.75, 4, 4.5, 5 hours) and 8 (0, 15, 30, 35, 45, 60, 90, 120 minutes)|Pharmacokinetics - Area Under the Concentration Curve (AUC), Area under the concentration curve from time zero to infinity., cycle 1, day 1 (0 minutes, 3, 3.25, 3.5, 3.58, 3.75, 4, 4.5, 5 hours) and 8 (0, 15, 30, 35, 45, 60, 90, 120 minutes)|Pharmacokinetics - Half Life (tÂ½), Apparent elimination half-life., cycle 1, day 1 (0 minutes, 3, 3.25, 3.5, 3.58, 3.75, 4, 4.5, 5 hours) and 8 (0, 15, 30, 35, 45, 60, 90, 120 minutes)
