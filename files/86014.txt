The present study is to determine the adverse effects and clinical efficacy of AI combined with Capecitabine metronomic chemotherapy in postmenopausal breast cancer patients with Estrogen receptor and/or Progestrogen receptor positive.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Capecitabine|DRUG: aromatase Inhibitors (AIs)
adverse events, adverse events (Hand-foot syndrome,Gynecological events, blood lipids, thrombosis, cardiovascular diseases,and etc.), average 10 months
PFS, Progression-free survival (PFS), average 10 months|TTF, time to treatment failure（TTF), average 10 months
