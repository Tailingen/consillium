Varlitinib in Combination With mFOLFOX6 for Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (First Line)
This protocol for Varlitinib is developed for the treatment of Gastric Cancer. Varlitinib (also known as ASLAN001) is a small-molecule, adenosine triphosphate competitive inhibitor of the tyrosine kinases - epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)2, and HER4. Varlitinib may be beneficial to subjects with cancer by simultaneous inhibition of these receptors. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of Varlitinib in combination with mFOLFOX6 for the treatment of Gastric Cancer. Treatment groups are Varlitinib+mFOLFOX6 and Placebo+mFOLFOX6.
