Evaluation Protocols for Isolation of Analytes From Urine for Future Oncology Applications
The aim of this study is to evaluate and optimize protocols for the isolation and analysis of analytes in urine (cell-free nucleic acids, extracellular vesicles and proteins). The following factors will be evaluated (1) volumetric collection with Colli-Pee®, a collection device developed by Novosanis for standardized collection of urine, and (2) stabilization methods.

This is a prospective study in which urine samples will be collected from healthy volunteers, urine samples and a blood sample from pregnant women and cancer patients with solid tumors with emphasis on breast- and prostate cancer. The participants will be asked to provide a urine sample collected with the Colli-Pee® device and fill out an online questionnaire to collect usability data. Thereafter, the urine sample will be aliquoted to be used in different pilot studies for the protocol optimization. For the pilot study where the effect of volume will be assessed, participants will be requested to collect multiple samples with different Colli-Pee® variants and fill out questionnaires accordingly.

Detection (presence/absence) of specific biomarker targets (SRY, HER2, PIK3CA, AR-V7, TMPRSS2-ERG) for pregnant women, breast cancer patients and prostate cancer patients measured using ddPCR., Comparison of target detection measured using ddPCR assays \[positive, negative or copies/µL\] in first-void urine samples from all study participants compared to blood testing using ddPCR. (Proof of concept study), Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Usability characteristics of the Colli-Pee UAS devices., All study participants will receive a questionnaire regarding the usability characteristic of the Colli-Pee UAS devices. These questions cover physical information, previous experiences, and usability questions. When scores need to be given participants can score between 0 and 100%, in which 0% is a negative score and 100% is a positive score. When an opinion is asked participants can choose between very difficult, difficult, neutral, easy, and very easy. Analysis will be done using descriptive statistics., Through study completion, an average of 1 year
