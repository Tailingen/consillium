Scleral Hydrops and Intralabyrinthine Schwannoma
The symptoms of intralabyrinthine schwannomas (vertigo, deafness, instability, tinnitus) cut across the symptoms found in pressure pathologies involving the inner ear, particularly the endolymphatic hydrops.

Some publications have described dilatation of the membranous labyrinth (hydrops) in the presence of intralabyrinthine tumors.

It would be interesting to measure the size of the saccule (structure of the membranous labyrinth) in the presence of an intralabyrinthine schwannoma, to evaluate if some of the symptoms presented by the patients could be explained by the concomitant presence of an endolymphatic hydrops (accessible to drug therapy - Betahistine).
