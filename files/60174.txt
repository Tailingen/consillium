Selinexor Combined With R-GDP Regimen for TP53-altered R/R DLBCL
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of selinexor combined with R-GDP regimen in the treatment of patients with TP53-altered relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphoma.
Relapsed or Refractory B-cell Lymphoma
DRUG: SR-GDP
Objective Response Rate, Objective Response Rate (ORR) : The investigator-assessed best disease status of patients with TP53-altered R/R DLBCL was the rate of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR), At the end of Cycle 6 (each cycle is 21 days)
progression free survival, Progression-free survival was defined as the time from the date of diagnosis until the date of the first documented day of disease progression or relapse, using 2014 Lugano criteria,or death from any cause, whichever occurred first., Baseline up to data cut-off (up to approximately 2 years)|overall survival, Overall survival was defined as the time from the date of diagnosis to the date of death from any cause. Reported is the percentage of participants with event. of disease progression or relapse, using 2014 Lugano criteria,or death from any cause, whichever occurred first., Baseline up to data cut-off (up to approximately 2 years)|Number of Participants With Treatment-Related Adverse Events as Assessed by CTCAE v4.0, An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events, Up to 30 days after completion of study treatment
This study is a single-arm, open-label exploratory clinical trial. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of selinexor combined with R-GDP regimen in the treatment of patients with TP53-altered relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphoma.
