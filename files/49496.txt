Exploring Whether Disease-free Intervals Can Guide Endocrine Combined Targeted Therapy for ER+/HER2+ Advanced Breast Cancer (T-sunflower)
This study is a prospective, single-arm, phase II clinical study for patients with ER+/HER2+ advanced breast cancer.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Trastuzumab|DRUG: pyrotinib|DRUG: Dalpiciclib|DRUG: fulvestrant
PFS, time to progressive disease (according to RECIST1.1), Randomization until the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, which ever occurs first, through the completion of study (approximately 5 years)
ORR, The proportion of participants whose best outcome is complete remission or partial remission (according to RECIST1.1), Randomization until the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, which ever occurs first, through the completion of study (approximately 5 years)|CBR, the percentage of subjects with CR+PR+SD and last more than 24 weeks in all of the, Randomization until the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, which ever occurs first, through the completion of study (approximately 5 years)|DOR, Duration of whose best outcome is complete remission or partial remission (according to RECIST1.1), Randomization until the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, which ever occurs first, through the completion of study (approximately 5 years)
Patients with ER+/HER2+ advanced breast cancer are planned to be enrolled. Patients will receive first-line endocrine therapy combined with anti-HER2 therapy. The main purpose is to evaluate whether disease-free intervals can guide first-line endocrine combined targeted therapy for ER+/HER2+ advanced breast cancer.
