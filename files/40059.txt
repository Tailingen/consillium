Study of Oral OSI-027 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors or Lymphoma
The primary objective of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and to establish the recommended phase 2 dose of oral OSI-027 when administered via 3 schedules, namely, intermittent, weekly, and continuous in patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphoma, namely, intermittent, weekly, and continuous.
Any Solid Tumor or Lymphoma
DRUG: OSI-027
Maximum tolerated dose, 21 days
Safety profile of OSI-027, up to 5 years|Pharmacokinetic profile of OSI-027, up to 23 days|Preliminary pharmacodynamic relationship with OSI-027 systemic exposure, up to 23 days|Preliminary antitumor activity of OSI-027, up to 5 years
The study will open with Schedule 1 (S1, intermittent) with initiation of Schedule 2 (S2, weekly) and Schedule 3 (S3, continuous), which may occur in parallel after observation of clinically significant related dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in the S1 schedule. Dosing will be initiated on Day 1 with intermittent weekly dosing continuing for 21 days (1 Treatment Period). Expansion of Dose Escalation Cohorts may occur for S1 and S2 at the recommended phase 2 dose level(s) and a Biomarker Expansion Cohort may be opened in S1 and/or S2.
