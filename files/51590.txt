Phase 1, First-in-human, Dose-finding and Expansion Study to Evaluate XmAb®808 in Combination With Pembrolizumab in Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of intravenous (IV) administration of XmAb808 in combination with pembrolizumab in subjects with selected advanced solid tumors and to identify the minimum safe and biologically effective/recommended dose (RD) and schedule for XmAb808.

This is a Phase 1, open-label, first-in-human (FIH), multiple-dose, dose escalation study with cohort expansion at the RD, designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of XmAb808 in combination with pembrolizumab. This study will be conducted in 2 parts: Part A (dose escalation) and Part B (cohort expansion).
