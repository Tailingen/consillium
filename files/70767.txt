A Study of Talquetamab and Teclistamab Each in Combination With a Programmed Cell Death Receptor-1 (PD-1) Inhibitor for the Treatment of Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of the study is to identify the safe dose(s) of a PD-1 inhibitor in combination with talquetamab or teclistamab, and to characterize the safety and tolerability of talquetamab or teclistamab when administered in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor.
Relapsed/ Refractory Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Talquetamab|DRUG: Teclistamab|DRUG: PD-1 Inhibitor
Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant participating in a clinical study that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the pharmaceutical/biological agent under study., Up to 2 years 5 months|Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) by Severity, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant participating in a clinical study that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the pharmaceutical/biological agent under study. Severity will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 5.0. Severity scale ranges from Grade 1 (Mild) to Grade 5 (Death). Grade 1= Mild, Grade 2= Moderate, Grade 3= Severe, Grade 4= Life-threatening, and Grade 5= Death related to adverse event., Up to 2 years 5 months|Number of Participants with Abnormalities in Clinical Laboratory Assessments, Number of participants with abnormalities in clinical laboratory assessments (serum chemistry and hematology) will be reported., Up to 2 years 5 months|Number of Participants with Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLTs), The DLTs are specific adverse events and are defined as any of the following: high grade non-hematologic toxicity, or hematologic toxicity., Up to 2 years 5 months
Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve partial response (PR) or better according to the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) 2016 criteria., Up to 2 years 5 months|Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) or Better Response Rate, VGPR or better response rate is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve a VGPR or better response (stringent complete response \[sCR\]+ complete response \[CR\]+VGPR) according to the IMWG 2016 criteria., Up to 2 years 5 months|Complete Response (CR) or Better Response Rate, CR or better response rate is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve a CR or better response (sCR+CR) according to the IMWG 2016 criteria., Up to 2 years 5 months|Stringent Complete Response (sCR) Rate, sCR rate is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve an sCR according to the IMWG 2016 criteria., Up to 2 years 5 months|Duration of Response, Duration of response is defined as time from date of initial documentation of a response (PR or better) to date of first documented evidence of progressive disease (PD), per IMWG 2016 criteria or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 2 years 5 months|Time to Response, Time to response is defined as the time between date of first dose of study treatment and the first efficacy evaluation at which the participant has met all criteria for PR or better., Up to 2 years 5 months|Serum Concentrations of Talquetamab, Serum samples will be analyzed to determine concentrations of Talquetamab using validated, specific, and sensitive immunoassay methods., Up to 2 years 5 months|Serum Concentrations of Teclistamab, Serum samples will be analyzed to determine concentrations of Teclistamab using validated, specific, and sensitive immunoassay methods., Up to 2 years 5 months|Serum Concentrations of PD-1 Inhibitor, Serum samples will be analyzed to determine concentrations of PD-1 inhibitor using validated, specific, and sensitive immunoassay methods., Up to 2 years 5 months|Number of Participants with Anti-Talquetamab Antibodies, Number of participants with anti-talquetamab antibodies will be reported., Up to 2 years 5 months|Number of Participants with Anti-Teclistamab Antibodies, Number of participants with anti-teclistamab antibodies will be reported., Up to 2 years 5 months|Number of Participants with Anti-PD-1 Inhibitor Antibodies, Number of participants with anti-PD-1 inhibitor antibodies will be reported., Up to 2 years 5 months
