A Parallel Group Comparison of the Efficacy and Safety of Degarelix at Two Different Dosing Regimens in Patients With Prostate Cancer
The purpose of the study was to contribute, along with other such dose-finding studies, to the identification of the most effective treatment regimen for a one month depot injection of degarelix in the treatment of prostate cancer by a rapid and sustained suppression of testosterone.
