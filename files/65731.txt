Rh-endostatin in Combination With Dacarbazine and Cisplatin as the First Line Therapy for Metastatic Melanoma
The incidence of Melanoma is rapidly growthing,and in China,dacarbazine combined with cisplatin is conmendly used as the first-line chemotherapy of metastatic melanoma. But the response rate and survival results are very limited.This trial aim to add a safe and effective anti-angiogenesis drug,Human-recombinant endostatin,to find out a new strategy which may further extend the PFS and OS with a tolerated toxicity.
