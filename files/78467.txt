A Study to Evaluate Vaccines Against COVID-19 in the Real World
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and the resulting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have afflicted tens of millions of people in a worldwide pandemic. Considering its high mortality and rapid spread, an effective vaccine is urgently needed to control this pandemic. Recently, mass vaccination campaigns using newly approved vaccines, ranging from conventional viral and protein-based vaccines to those that are more cutting edge, including DNA- and mRNA-based vaccines are beginning in many parts of the world. Randomized clinical trials of different vaccines reported efficacies for preventing COVID-19 in the range of 50% to 95%.

Although these randomized clinical trials are considered the "gold standard" for evaluating intervention effects, they have notable limitations of sample size and subgroup analysis, restrictive inclusion criteria, and a highly controlled setting that may not be replicated in a mass vaccine rollout.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and efficacy of different vaccines against COVID-19 under real-world practice conditions.

Immunogenicity index-seroconversion rates of neutralizing antibody, Neutralizing antibody assay will be performed using the micro-neutralization method. Seroconversion will be defined as a change from seronegative (\<1:8) to seropositive (≥1:8), or ≥4 fold increase from baseline., The 4 weeks after the second dose vaccination
Safety index-incidence of adverse reactions, Incidence of adverse reactions after each dose vaccination, Day 0-28 after each dose vaccination|Immunogenicity index-seropositive rates of neutralizing antibody, neutralizing antibody assay will be performed using the micro-neutralization method, and subjects with a antibody titer ≥1:8 will defined as seropositive., The 4, 12, 24, and 48 weeks after the second dose vaccination
