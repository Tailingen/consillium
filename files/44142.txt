DRUG: Envafolimab
pathological complete response (pCR), Pathological complete response (pCR) is defined as the absence of residual invasive cancer on hematoxylin and eosin evaluation of the complete resected breast specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes following completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy (i.e., ypT0/Tis ypN0 in the current AJCC staging system), one year
R0 resection rates, R0 resection was performed if there was no visible tumor residue within 1 mm of the surgical margin., one year|pathological partial response(MPR), It was defined as â‰¤ 10% remaining viable tumor cells at surgical resection of the primary tumor, one year
All eligible subjects will receive 5\*5Gy (25Gy/5F) fractionated radiotherapy, rest for 1 week, 3 cycles of Envafolimab, Endostatin and SOX regimen, and radical surgery 2 to 4 weeks after completion of the last neoadjuvant therapy, according to the study plan. Each patient will be followed up 12 months after initiation of treatment in the study. Whether the subjects need adjuvant therapy after surgery and the adjuvant treatment plan are determined by the investigator. All subjects were required to complete the study follow-up plan after surgery.
