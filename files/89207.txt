This paper evaluates the initial complications and the complications two years postoperatively necessitating re-hospitalisation for three surgical procedures for renal tumour partial nephrectomy (open (OPN), standard laparoscopy (LPN) and robot assisted laparoscopy (RAPN)) in 2016-2017 in France (9119 initial hospitalisations included 4035 OPN, 1900 RAPN, 1709 LPN). The investigators have extracted for these all hospitalisations from the French national hospital data base (PMSI-MCO). The investigators concluded mini-invasive and robotic surgery had lower morbidity and a shorter initial hospitalisation.
