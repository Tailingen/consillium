DRUG: PEN-221|DRUG: PEN-221
Phase 1: Maximum Tolerated Dose of PEN-221 and Recommended Phase 2a Dose (RP2D), MTD was determined by testing increasing doses up to 25 mg flat dose IV over 1 hour on an every 3 week cycle on dose escalation cohorts 1 to 7 with 2 participants in cohort 1 and 3-6 participants each in cohorts 2-7. The MTD was defined as the highest drug dosage not causing a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) in \> 33% of the treated participants during the first cycle of treatment. DLTs were defined as any Grade 3 or 4 adverse event (AE) using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.03 occurring within the first 4 weeks for cohort 1 and within 3 weeks for each subsequent cohort that was not related to underlying disease, disease progression, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medications.

Protocol PEN-221-001 will first enroll patients into a dose escalation phase, where a Bayesian logistic regression model, guided by the escalation with overdose control principle and overseen by a safety review committee, will be used to make dose recommendations and estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

Once the MTD has been confirmed, remaining patients will be enrolled into a full expansion phase to assess PEN-221 efficacy in patients with gastrointestinal mid-gut neuroendocrine tumors or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors or small cell lung cancer.
