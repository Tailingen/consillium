Phase I/II Open-Label, Dose Escalation Study To Determine The Maximum Tolerated Dose And To Evaluate The Safety Profile of Lenalidomide (RevlimidÂ® CC-5013) With Liposomal Doxorubicin In Subjects With Advanced Ovarian and Primary Peritoneal Carcinoma
Phase I will determine the MTD and evaluated the safety profile of oral lenalidomide on days 1-21 when given with liposomal doxorubicin on day 1 of every 28 day cycle Phase II will commence once the MTD is established, additional subjects will be enrolled and receive oral lenalidomide on days 1-21 with liposomal doxorubicinon day 1 in 28 day cycles until disease progression is documented.
