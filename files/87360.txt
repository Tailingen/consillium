Ph II CABOGIST in GIST
The study is a multi-center, multi-national, open label, single arm Phase II study of single-agent cabozantinib. The objective of the study is to assess the safety and activity of cabozantinib in patients with metastatic GIST who have previously progressed on imatinib and sunitinib and have not been exposed yet to other KIT- or PDGFR-directed tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

Patient will receive cabozantinib until they experience no further benefit from the treatment, becoming intolerant to the drug or wishing to discontinue the treatment. Treatment beyond RECIST 1.1 progression is allowed in patients deriving clinical benefit upon investigator's discretion, provided no other criteria for treatment withdrawal are met.
