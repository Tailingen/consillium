The assessment Items includes:

* Vertebral Scoring: It evaluates the morphology of each vertebra from T1 to L5. Each vertebra is scored from 0 to 3 based on the presence and degree of squaring, erosions, and syndesmophytes. For example, 0 means normal vertebra, and 3 indicates severe structural changes.
* Intervertebral Disc Scoring: The intervertebral discs between the vertebrae are also assessed. The score ranges from 0 to 2, depending on the presence and extent of disc space narrowing and bridging syndesmophytes.

Total Score Calculation: The scores of all vertebrae and intervertebral discs are summed up to obtain the mSASSS total score. The higher the score, the more severe the spinal damage., week 104|Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada (SPARCC), The SPARCC assessment method is a valuable tool in the field of spondyloarthritis research and diagnosis.

The assessment Items include:

* Sacroiliac Joint Assessment: It evaluates the sacroiliac joints using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The assessment includes aspects such as bone marrow edema, erosion, and fatty infiltration in the sacroiliac joints. Each feature is scored based on its severity and extent.
* Spinal Assessment: For the spine, SPARCC also uses MRI to assess inflammation. It focuses on detecting signs like vertebral corner inflammation (enthesitis) and discitis. Similar to the sacroiliac joint assessment, specific features are scored according to their characteristics.

Scoring System: The total SPARCC score is obtained by summing up the scores of different items. Higher scores indicate more severe inflammation and greater disease activity., week 104

The BASFI assesses a patient's ability to perform 10 daily activities. These include things like bending to pick up an object from the floor, getting in and out of a car, and turning around in bed.

Scoring Process

* Each activity is scored on a scale from 0 to 10. A score of 0 means the patient can perform the activity without any difficulty, while a score of 10 indicates that the patient is completely unable to do the activity.
* After scoring each activity, the scores are added together. The sum ranges from 0 to 100.
* This sum is then divided by 10 to get the final BASFI score, which ranges from 0 to 10.

The lower the score, the lower the disease activity., week 12, week 24, week 52|Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Change from baseline in VAS score. The VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) scoring method is a commonly used tool for quantitative assessment in medicine that allows patients to directly mark their perceived degree of a certain symptom or condition on a straight line. It transforms subjective feelings into objective numerical values for quantification and comparison.

Scoring Process: a 10-cm straight line is used, with the left end marked as 0 representing no symptom or the best condition, and the right end marked as 10 representing the most severe symptom or the worst condition., week 12, week 24, week 52|Maastricht Ankylosing Spondylitis Enthesitis Score (MASES), The Maastricht Ankylosing Spondylitis Enthesitis Score (MASES) is used to evaluate enthesitis in patients with ankylosing spondylitis.

Components of Assessment: 1)Patient Global Assessment : Patients rate their overall disease activity in the past week on a 0 - 100 mm Visual Analogue Scale, with 0 indicating no disease activity and 100 representing the most severe activity.2)Spinal Pain: The patient assesses the pain in the spine in the past week on a 0 - 100 mm VAS, where 0 means no pain and 100 is the most intense pain.3) Inflammatory Back Pain: It is scored based on a binary scale, 0 for no pain.4)C-reactive Protein level.

Calculation of the Score:

The ASDAS-CRP score is calculated through a specific formula: ASDAS-CRP = 0.12 × PGA + 0.28 × spinal pain + 0.16 × IBP + 0.10 × ln(CRP + 1). The result of the calculation is the ASDAS-CRP score, which is used to classify the disease activity level. Generally, a score of \<1.3 indicates inactive disease, 1.3 - 2.1 indicates low disease activity, 2.1 - 3.5 indicates moderate disease activity, and \>3.5 indicates high disease activity., week 12, week 24, week 52|Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score based on Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ASDAS-ESR), Change from baseline in ASDAS-ESR. Assessment Elements: 1)Patient Global Assessment: Similar to ASDAS-CRP, patients rate their overall disease activity in the past week on a 0 - 100 mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), with 0 meaning no disease activity and 100 being the highest level of activity.2)Spinal Pain: Patients assess their spinal pain in the past week on a 0 - 100 mm VAS, where 0 represents no pain and 100 is the worst pain.3)Inflammatory Back Pain (IBP): It is scored as 0 for no IBP and 1 for having IBP.4)Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR): The ESR value in mm/h is used as a key indicator.

Score Calculation:The formula for calculating ASDAS-ESR is: ASDAS-ESR = 0.12 × PGA + 0.28 × spinal pain + 0.16 × IBP + 0.08 × ln(ESR + 1). The calculated score is used to determine the disease activity level. Typically, a score of \<1.3 suggests inactive disease, 1.3 - 2.1 indicates low disease activity, 2.1 - 3.5 represents moderate disease activity, and \>3.5 means high disease activity., week 12, week 24, week 52|Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life (ASQoL), Change from baseline in ASQoL.
