By using the M.A.D.I.T. methodology and the Dialogics science, SALVO Project aims to develop operational guidelines to support oncological target patients in the resumption of their daily post-operative activities. The research will implement an instrument for the purpose of measuring the health need of participants who are admitted to the surgical ward. Therefore, targeted interventions will be implemented with participants, and efficacy will be evaluated in order to define treatment guidelines.
