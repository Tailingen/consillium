Impact of Omega-3 Fatty Acids on Lactate
Pre- and intra-operative nutritional support in patient undergoing major surgery results in decreased morbidity and mortality. Studies investigating the role of omega-3 fatty acids in these patients are increasing. Some are focused on perfusion at the cellular level. This study was undertaken to address the effect of postoperative administration of omega-3 fatty acids on cellular hypoperfusion associated with major gastric surgery.
