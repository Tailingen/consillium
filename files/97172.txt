Lung Cancer
DRUG: Dexmedetomidine Group|DRUG: dexamethasone group|DRUG: control group
Change of thoracic paravertebral block analgesia duration, The prime outcomes were the time in minutes from leave the postoperative care unit to the first patient-controlled intravenous analgesia press, Change from Baseline to 2 days after surgery
blood concentrations of ropivacaine, (The secondary outcomes were to compare the following: (1)blood concentrations of ropivacaine was measured at 0.5 h, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, and 24 h after paravertebral nerve block; and (2) the patient's intraoperative opioid use, phenylephrine use, fluid intake, urine output, dry mouth score, and 24 h and 48 h visual analogue scale., Change from Baseline to 2 days after surgery
