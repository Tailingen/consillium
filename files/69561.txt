Safety Study of Clostridium Novyi-NT Spores to Treat Patients With Solid Tumors That Have Not Responded to Standard Therapies
This protocol will examine the safety of intravenous administration of Clostridium novyi-NT spores in patients with treatment-refractory solid tumor malignancies. This investigational study will measure anti-tumor activity of C. novyi-NT administered intravenously in patients with treatment-refractory solid tumor malignancies.
Solid Tumor Malignancies
BIOLOGICAL: Clostridium novyi-NT spores
Safety and tolerability of C. novyi-NT spore administration in patients with advanced solid tumor malignancies will be measured over a 7-day inpatient admission with routine labs and continuous adverse event assessments., 2 years
Anti-tumor activity of C. novyi-NT spores will be assessed with serial imaging studies such as CT scans and blood-based tumor markers., 2 years|Pharmacokinetics of the C. novyi-NT spores will be measured in routine blood sampling over the course of the study., 2 years|The host immune and inflammatory response to C. novyi-NT spores will be measured in routine blood sampling over the course of the study., 2 years
