A Study of Telatinib in Combination With Chemotherapy in Subjects With Advanced Gastric Cancer
The objectives of this study are to evaluate the anti-tumor activity, safety, and tolerability of telatinib when used in combination with chemotherapy (capecitabine and cisplatin) as first-line therapy in subjects with advanced gastric cancer. The primary objective is to assess progression free survival (PFS) in subjects receiving telatinib in combination with chemotherapy (capecitabine and cisplatin). The secondary objectives are to assess overall survival, overall response rate, safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics and biomarkers.
Gastric Cancer
DRUG: Cisplatin, Capecitabine, Telatinib
The primary objective is to assess progression free survival (PFS). PFS will be measured from the date of first study drug administration to the date of first scan that first documents disease progression., 6 months
Other efficacy variables are overall survival, overall response rate, safety and tolerability. Exploratory analyses may be performed to investigate the correlation of biomarker status with treatment effect and response., 18 months from start of enrollment to evaluation of primary endpoint
