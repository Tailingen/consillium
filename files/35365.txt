ALTTO (Adjuvant Lapatinib And/Or Trastuzumab Treatment Optimisation) Study; BIG 2-06/N063D
This was a four-arm (parallel group) randomized, open-label, multicenter Phase 3 study to investigate the use of a combination of Lapatinib and Trastuzumab, a sequence of Trastuzumab followed by Lapatinib, and Lapatinib alone, compared to Trastuzumab alone in the adjuvant treatment of Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) positive early breast cancer.
Neoplasms, Breast
DRUG: Lapatinib|BIOLOGICAL: Trastuzumab
Disease-Free Survival (DFS) at the Primary Analysis, Disease-Free Survival (DFS) was defined as the interval between randomization and the date of first occurrence of disease recurrence (local, regional or distant), a contralateral invasive breast cancer, a second primary cancer or death without recurrence. Only deaths occurring in participants whose clinical follow-up was ongoing at the time of death and who had no recurrence, contralateral breast cancer (CBC) or second primary malignancy (SPM) reported prior to death were considered as death without recurrence. DFS was estimated using the Kaplan Meier method. The percentile data values presented here indicate the percentage (95, 90, 85, 80 and 75 percent) of participants who had disease free survival for the indicated years., From randomization until the date of the first occurrence of disease recurrence, a contralateral invasive breast cancer, a second primary cancer, or death from any cause (median follow-up of 4.5 years)
Disease-Free Survival (DFS) at the 10-Year Follow-Up, Disease-Free Survival (DFS) was defined as the interval between randomization and the date of first occurrence of disease recurrence (local, regional or distant), a contralateral invasive breast cancer, a second primary cancer or death without recurrence. Only deaths occurring in participants whose clinical follow-up was ongoing at the time of death and who had no recurrence, contralateral breast cancer (CBC) or second primary malignancy (SPM) reported prior to death were considered as death without recurrence. DFS was estimated using the Kaplan Meier method. The percentile data values presented here indicate the percentage (95, 90, 85 and 80 percent) of participants who had disease free survival for the indicated years., From randomization until the date of the first occurrence of disease recurrence, a contralateral invasive breast cancer, a second primary cancer, or death from any cause, assessed up to approximately 10 years|Overall Survival (OS) at the Primary Analysis, Overall Survival (OS) was defined as the time from randomization until death due to any cause. Participants who had not died were censored at the last date they were known to be alive, or date of withdrawal of consent. OS was calculated in years as (date of death minus the date of randomization +1) divided by 365.25. The percentile data values presented here indicate the percentage (99, 98, 97, 96, 95 and 90 percent) of participants who survived for the indicated years., From randomization until death due to any cause (median follow-up of 4.5 years)|Overall Survival (OS) at the 10-Year Follow-Up, Overall Survival (OS) was defined as the time from randomization until death due to any cause. Participants who had not died were censored at the last date they were known to be alive, or date of withdrawal of consent. OS was calculated in years as (date of death minus the date of randomization +1) divided by 365.25. The percentile data values presented here indicate the percentage (99, 98, 95 and 90 percent) of participants who survived for the indicated years., From randomization until death due to any cause, assessed up to approximately 10 years|Analysis of Time to Recurrence (TTR), Time to Recurrence (TTR) was defined as the the time from randomization to breast cancer recurrence, ignoring second primary cancers (including contralateral breast cancers and non-breast second malignancies) and counting deaths without recurrence as a competing risk., From randomization until the date of the first occurrence of a disease recurrence, assessed up to approximately 10 years|Analysis of Time to Distant Recurrence (TTDR), Time to Distant Recurrence (TTDR) was defined as the the time from randomization to first distant breast cancer recurrence, ignoring locoregional recurrences and second primary cancers, (including contralateral breast cancers and non-breast second malignancies ) and counting deaths without recurrence as a competing risk., From randomization until the date of the first occurrence of distant recurrence, assessed up to approximately 10 years|Analysis of Time to Central Nervous System (CNS) Recurrence, Time to Central Nervous System (CNS) recurrence was defined as the time from randomization to first CNS recurrence. Both brain metastasis and meningitis carcinomatosa were considered., From randomization until the first central nervous system recurrence, assessed up to approximately 10 years|Cumulative Incidence of Brain Metastases, The cumulative incidence of brain metastases as the first site of breast cancer recurrence among treatment arms was assessed using a hierarchy of primary type and location of first DFS event in cases where more than one event was identified simultaneously. Because diagnostic procedures for different types of recurrence could not be performed on exactly the same day, any diagnoses noted within a two month (60 day) period of the first reported event was considered as identified simultaneously for purposes of defining the type of the first event and the date of event was be regarded as the earliest of the relevant events., From randomization until the date of the first occurrence of a disease recurrence, assessed up to approximately 10 years
Treatment allocation was stratified by blocked randomization, with three stratification factors:

* Hormone receptor status: Estrogen Receptor (ER) and/or Progesterone Receptor (PgR) positive versus both negative.
* Axillary lymph node involvement: not assessed because of neoadjuvant chemotherapy versus node negative versus 1-3 positive nodes versus 4 or more positive nodes.
* Timing of adjuvant chemotherapy: concurrently with taxanes and targeted therapy (Design 2) and concurrently with non-anthracycline-based platinum chemotherapy and targeted therapy (Design 2B) versus all other chemotherapy completed before randomization (Design 1). Treatments delivered differed according to the timing and type of adjuvant chemotherapy.

The primary objective of this study was to compare disease-free survival (DFS) in subjects with HER2 overexpressing and/or amplified breast cancer randomized to trastuzumab for one year versus lapatinib for one year versus trastuzumab (12 or 18 weeks, according to assigned design) followed by a six week treatment-free interval followed by lapatinib (28 or 34 weeks, according to assigned design) versus trastuzumab in combination with lapatinib for one year (52 weeks).

Secondary objectives included treatment comparisons with respect to overall survival, time to recurrence, time to distant recurrence, safety and tolerability, and incidence of brain metastasis.

Based on the recommendation of the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) at the first interim analysis (18-Aug-2011), the Lapatinib alone arm was discontinued prior to primary analysis due to futility. The IDMC also stated that the other three arms (trastuzumab alone, sequential trastuzumab/lapatinib arm and the combination arm) could continued as planned with no changes.
