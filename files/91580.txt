HX008 Plus Chemotherapy VS Pembrolizumab Plus Chemotherapy As the First-line Treatment in Participants With Advanced or Metastatic Nonsquamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This a phase II-III study. In the single-armed phase II period, HX008, a monoclonal antibody targeting PD-1, will be combined with pemetrexed+platinum (Investigators choice of cisplatin or carboplatin) chemotherapy to treat participants with advanced or metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have not previously received systemic therapy for advanced disease. When the preliminary efficacy and safety data are acquired, a single-blinded phase III study will ensue, in which the efficacy and safety of HX008+pemetrexed+platinum VS pembrolizumab+pemetrexed+platinum in participants of the same population will be compared head-to-head with 1:1 randomization. The primary endpoints are safety and ORR (overall response rate) evaluated by the investigator in phase II study, and PFS evaluated by IRC (independent review committee) in phase III study. The primary hypothesis in phase III study is that HX008+pemetrexed+platinum is non-inferior to pembrolizumab+pemetrexed+platinum in terms of PFS (Progression-Free Survival).
