The Clinical Validity and Safety of IOP Injection MRI Contrast Agent in Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This study is an exploratory study aiming to collect data on sensitivity and positive predictive value of IOP-enhanced (MPB-1523) MRI compared to dynamic multiphase MDCT for the detection of HCC.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging
DRUG: IOP Injection (MPB-1523)
The Sensitivity and specificity of IOP-enhanced MRI, Sensitivity and specificity of IOP-enhanced MRI will be calculated using dynamic multiphase MDCT as the reference standard. Confirmation of the diagnosis of HCC lesions will be obtained by surgery., After IOP injection administration within 60 mins
Optimal time to perform a MRI scan after injection of IOP, Optimal time of IOP Injection, After IOP injection administration within 60 mins|The Number of lesions detected in liver, The sensitivity of IOP Injection, After IOP injection administration within 60 mins|The size of lesions detected in liver, The sensitivity of IOP Injection, After IOP injection administration within 60 mins
The planned duration of the clinical study for individual subjects is up to 12 weeks.
