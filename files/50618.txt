Physical Activity in Men Newly Diagnosed With Prostate Cancer: A Feasibility Study
Recent research has indicated that physical activities incorporating moderate-intensity exercise can be safely performed during treatment and substantially reduces treatment-related side effects, such as fatigue, sleep disturbances, cognitive impairment, and nausea. However, little is known about physical activity levels prior to treatment and whether providing an exercise intervention pre-treatment may improve functional capacity during treatment.

The purpose of this study is to

1. Measure physical activity levels and functional capacity in men newly diagnosed with prostate cancer prior to treatment and
2. Explore whether a 2-week physical activity intervention is feasible during the pre-treatment timeframe:

   1. Examine intervention safety and tolerance by self-report
   2. Examine changes in functional capacity by 6-minute walk test
   3. Examine changes in symptom experience by self-report
