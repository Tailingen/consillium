Study of CAR-20/19-T Cells in Patients With Relapsed Refractory B Cell
This is a phase 1/1b, interventional single arm, open label, treatment study designed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of infusion of autologous T cells engineered to contain an anti-cluster of differentiation 19 (CD19) and anti-cluster of differentiation 20 (CD20) single chain variable fragment (scFv) coupled to cluster of differentiation CD3ζ (CD3ζ) and co-stimulatory domain 4-1BB (4-1BB) signaling domains in patients with relapsed and/or refractory CD19 or CD20 positive B cell malignancies

BIOLOGICAL: CAR-20/19-T cells (1.0 x10^5 CAR-20/19-T cells/kg)|BIOLOGICAL: CAR-20/19-T cells (2.5 x10^5 CAR-20/19-T cells/kg)|BIOLOGICAL: CAR-20/19-T cells (7.5 x10^5 CAR-20/19-T cells/kg)|BIOLOGICAL: CAR-20/19-T cells (2.5 x10^6 CAR-20/19-T cells/kg)
Number of Adverse Events After CAR 20/19-T Cell Infusion, This measure is the number of adverse events with grade 3 to 5 severity per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (ver. 4.03) occurring within the first 28 days following infusion., 28 days after infusion
This is a single center, single arm, open label phase I/1b study to demonstrate the feasibility of manufacturing CAR-T cells expressing tandem receptors against both CD20 and CD19 (CAR-20/19-T) in a completely closed system using the CliniMACS Prodigy device and then determine the safety of this dual targeted CAR in a first-in-human study of patients with relapsed and refractory B cell malignancies. Secondary outcomes will include response rates, and observed toxicities of the treatment, specifically the development of cytokine release syndrome (CRS), an inflammatory storm that has been seen with previous CAR-T therapies.
