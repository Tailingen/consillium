A Study of Gilteritinib (ASP2215) Combined With Chemotherapy in Children, Adolescents and Young Adults With FMS-like Tyrosine Kinase 3 (FLT3)/Internal Tandem Duplication (ITD) Positive Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
The purpose of the phase 1 portion (dose escalation) of the study will be to establish an optimally safe and biologically active recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and/or to determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for gilteritinib in sequential combination with fludarabine, cytarabine and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (FLAG). The purpose of the phase 2 portion (dose expansion) is to determine complete remission (CR) rates and composite complete remission (CRc) rates after two cycles of therapy. The study will also assess safety, tolerability and toxicities of gilteritinib in combination with FLAG, evaluate FLT3 inhibition, assess pharmacokinetics (PK), perform serial measurements of minimal residual disease, obtain preliminary estimates of 1-year event free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rate and assess the acceptability as well as palatability of the formulation.

One cycle is defined as 28 days of treatment. A participant completing 1 or 2 treatment cycles in phase 1 or 2 will have the option to participate in long term treatment (LTT) with gilteritinib (for up to 2 years).

DRUG: gilteritinib|DRUG: fludarabine|DRUG: cytarabine|DRUG: granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)
Number of participants with dose limiting toxicity (DLT) (phase 1/dose escalation), DLT is defined as any of the events meeting the DLT criteria that occur during DLT observation period \& that is considered to be possibly or probably related to protocol therapy. Nonhematologic (NH) DLT will be defined as grade 3 NH toxicity at least possibly related to protocol therapy that persists for \>48 hours without resolution to grade ≤ 2 or 4 NH toxicity, regardless of duration, at least possibly related to protocol therapy. Hy's law or treatment-related deaths will be considered as a DLT. Gilteritinib dosing will be interrupted if NH DLT occurs. Exceptions include toxicities commonly seen with intensive AML reinduction regimens. Hematologic DLT will be defined as failure to recover a peripheral absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \>500/μL \& non-transfusion dependent platelet count \>20000/μL due to documented bone marrow aplasia/hypoplasia at day 42 from start of cycle 1 day 1. Failure to recover peripheral counts due to disease involvement of bone marrow will not be considered DLT, Up to 28 days|Complete Remission (CR) rate after 2 cycles of therapy (phase 2), CR rate is defined as the number of participants who achieve the best response of CR divided by the number of participants in the analysis population. Complete remission is defined as having bone marrow regenerating normal hematopoietic cells and achieving a morphologic leukemia-free state and must have an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1 x 10\^9/L and platelet count ≥ 100 x 10\^9/L and normal marrow differential with \< 5% blasts, and they will be red blood cell (RBC) and platelet transfusion independent (defined as 1 week without RBC transfusion and 1 week without platelet transfusion). There should be no evidence of extramedullary leukemia., Up to 56 days|Composite complete remission (CRc) rate after 2 cycles of therapy (phase 2), CRc rate is defined as the number of participants who achieve the best response of CRc (CR, CRp,or CRi) divided by the number of participants in the analysis population. Complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp) is defined as achieving CR except for incomplete platelet recovery (\< 100 x 10\^9/L) at a post baseline visit. Complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) is defined as achieving CR except for incomplete hematological recovery with residual neutropenia \< 1 x 10\^9/L with or without complete platelet recovery at a post baseline visit. Red blood cell (RBC) and platelet transfusion independence is not required., Up to 56 days
Number of participants with Adverse Events (AEs), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a study drug, and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product whether or not considered related to the medicinal product., Up to 2 years plus 28 day follow up|Number of participants with vital sign abnormalities and /or adverse events (AEs), Number of participants with potentially clinically significant vital sign values., Up to 2 years|Number of participants with laboratory value abnormalities and/or adverse events (AEs), Number of participants with potentially clinically significant laboratory values., Up to 2 years|Number of participants with electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities and/or adverse events (AEs), Number of participants with potentially clinically significant ECG values., Up to 2 years|Percentage of inhibition of phosphorylated FLT3 in participants., Inhibition of FLT3 phosphorylation after drug treatment will be determined relative to pre-treatment phosphorylated FLT3 levels in participants to assess the relationship with gilteritinib dose. Phosphorylated FLT3 will be measured by plasma inhibitory activity (PIA) assay., Up to 49 days|Pharmacokinetics (PK) of gilteritinib: oral clearance (CL/F), CL/F will be reported from the PK plasma samples collected., Up to 45 days|PK of gilteritinib: apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F), Vd/F will be reported from the PK plasma samples collected., Up to 45 days|PK of gilteritinib: Maximum Concentration (Cmax), Cmax will be reported from the PK plasma samples collected., Up to 45 days|PK of gilteritinib: Time of Maximum Concentration (tmax), tmax will be reported from the PK plasma samples collected., Up to 45 days|PK of gilteritinib: Area Under the Concentration (AUC), AUC will be reported from the PK plasma samples collected., Up to 45 days|Duration of Event Free Survival (EFS), EFS is defined as the time from the date of enrollment until the date of documented relapse (excluding relapse after PR), treatment failure or death, whichever occurs first. If a participant experiences relapse or death, the participant is defined as having EFS event related to either "relapse" or "death", and the event date is the date of relapse or death. If a participant fails to achieve any of the response of CR, CRp, CRi or PR during the treatment period, the participant is defined as having EFS event related to treatment failure, and the event date is the enrollment date. For a participant who is not known to have had a relapse or treatment failure or death event, EFS is censored at the date of last relapse-free disease assessment. Participant is not censored at hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT)., Up to 2 years|Duration of Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of enrollment until the date of death from any cause. For a participant who is not known to have died by the end-of-study follow-up, OS is censored at the date of last contact., Up to 4 years and 2 months|The number of participants with negative minimal residual disease (MRD) status, MRD negative status will be defined as FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) signal ratio ≤ 10\^-4., Up to 2 years|Number of participants with MRD negative status in relation to CR rate, MRD negative status will be defined as FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) signal ratio ≤ 10\^-4., Up to 2 years|Number of participants with MRD negative status in relation to CRc rate, MRD negative status will be defined as FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) signal ratio ≤ 10\^-4., Up to 2 years|Number of participants with MRD negative status in relation to Overall survival (OS), MRD negative status will be defined as FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) signal ratio ≤ 10\^-4., Up to 2 years|Clinical Outcome Assessment of Taste, The acceptability and palatability of gilteritinib oral formulation as assessed by the participant using a single scale. The 5 point facial hedonic scale has high to low as: Liked it Very Much, Liked it a Little, Not sure, Disliked it a Little, Disliked it Very Much., Up to 57 days
