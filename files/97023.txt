CD22/CD19 CAR-T and Blinatumomab Combined With Auto-HSCT Sandwich Strategy as Consolidation Therapy for B-ALL
Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy has achieved remarkable efficacy in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). However, relapse after CAR-T has been a major issue. Multi-antigen CAR T and combination with other regimens may reduce the relapse rate. We conducted CD22/CD19 CAR T-cells and blinatumoab combined with auto-HSCT "sandwich " strategy as consolidation therapy in patients with B-ALL. The main Purpose of this study was to observe the safety and efficacy of this new strategy.
