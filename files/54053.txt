A Study of Bevacizumab in Ovarian Cancer or Primary Peritoneal Cancer Where Doxil or Topotecan Therapy Has Failed
This is an open-label, single-arm, two-stage, multicenter Phase II study evaluating the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab in women with platinum resistant, advanced (Stage III or IV) EOC (epithelial ovarian cancer) or PPC (primary peritoneal cancer) that subsequently progressed either during treatment with Doxil or Hycamtin therapy or within 3 months of discontinuing treatment with Doxil or Hycamtin therapy.
