RP-6306 in Patients With Advanced Cancer
This study is being done to answer the following questions:

* Is the new drug, RP-6306, safe to use, and what effects does it have on cancer when given with standard treatment?
* If there are specific biomarkers, do patients have an improved response to treatment compared to those without the biomarker?

This study is being done to find out if this approach is better or worse than the usual approach for this type of cancer. The usual approach is defined as care most people get for this type of cancer.

RP-6306 is a PKMYT1 inhibitor. PKMYT1 protein kinase negatively regulates CDK1 via phosphorylation of threonine 14 (Thr14) and sequestration in the cytoplasm. RP-6306 has shown single-agent anti-tumour efficacy in several xenograft models with amplified CCNE1 in a dose-dependent manner. RP-6306 has synergistic effects in combination with gemcitabine in CCNE1-amplified/overexpressing models in vitro and in vivo
