Effect of Low-dose Esketamine on Postoperative Depression in Patients With Breast Cancer
esketamine is an optical isomer of ketamine. Compared with ketamine, esketamine has the characteristics of higher effective value, stronger receptor affinity, less adverse reactions of nervous system, and pharmacokinetics is controllable.

Domestic and foreign studies have focused on the therapeutic effect of esketamine on major depression, but less attention has been paid to perioperative depression.This study intends to explore the effect of small doses of esketamine on patients with breast cancer.Postoperative depression and pain are observed.
Depression
DRUG: Esketamine|DRUG: normal saline
depression score, The total rough score is the sum of all the scores in the 20 items, and then the rough score is multiplied by 1.25 to take the round part to get the standard score.

An SDS score of 53 to 62 is classified as mild depression, 63 to 72 as moderate depression, and 73 or more as major depression., Change from Baseline score at 3 months
pain score, visual analogue scale 0 points painless;

1 to 3 points for mild pain; 4 to 6 points moderate pain; Severe pain on a 7-9 scale; 10 points severe pain., Change from Baseline score at 3 months|The serum leptin level, The serum leptin level 1 day before surgery, 2 days ,5 days 30 days and 90 days after surgery, Change from 1 day before surgery to 90 days after surgery
This study intends to explore the effect of small doses of esketamine on patients with breast cancer.WE pay attention to :

1. Safety of low-dose single intravenous injection of esketamine (1)The influence of intraoperative vital signs of patients after medication, such as blood pressure and heart rate fluctuation; (2)the duration of recovery after anesthesia; (3)postoperative adverse reactions, such as nausea and vomiting, dizziness and diplopia, respiratory depression, laryngeal spasm, delirium agitation, etc
2. Effect of single intravenous injection of low-dose ketamine on postoperative depression in patients undergoing radical mastectomy (1) 1 day before surgery, 2 days, 5 days, 30 days, 90 days after surgery Hamilton Depression Scale scores; (2) The serum leptin level 1 day before surgery, 2 days after surgery and 5 days after surgery; (3) Correlation between depression scale score and leptin level
3. Effects of low dose esketamine on acute and chronic pain in patients undergoing radical mastectomy

   * visual analogue scale scores at 6, 12 and 24 hours after surgery;

     * visual analogue scale scores at 3, 5, 30 and 90 days after surgery;

       * the number of analgesic remedies
