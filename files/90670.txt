A Prospective Clinical Study to Validate a Preoperative Risk Scoring Model for LNM in GC Patients
In our prior research, a risk scoring model for the occurrence of lymph node metastasis in patients who underwent radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer was established. To further validate this scoring model, a prospective study has been designed with the aim of prospectively assessing the model's clinical applicability.

lymph node metastasis, Collect postoperative pathological data from gastric cancer patients who have undergone curative gastrectomy to determine the occurrence of lymph node metastasis., 1 month after curative surgery
The study was a single-centre, prospective study. Data prospectively accrued were employed to evaluate the concordance between observed patient outcomes, with respect to lymph node metastasis status post-curative gastrectomy, and the prognostications tendered by the established risk scoring model, thereby appraising the model's clinical applicability and validity.
