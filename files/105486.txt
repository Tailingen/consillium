Chromosome Abnormalities in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) on Imatinib. GIST Patients on Imatinib
In order to distinguish between clonal instability driven by imatinib in CML and actual changes with secondary clones induced by imatinib we would like to investigate the karyotype of non-CML patients treated with imatinib such as GIST patients.

PROCEDURE: bone marrow aspiration
~ presence or absence of genetic abnormality as seen in CML patients on imatinib
Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by the presence of the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome - a t(9:22) translocation that results in the production of a BCR/ABL fusion protein with Abl kinase activity.

Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) specifically targets a limited set of protein tyrosine kinases - ABL, Arg (Abl-related gene), c-Kit, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGF-R) - and their oncogenic forms, most notably BCR/ABL Imatinib is also a potent inhibitor of a receptor-type c-Kit tyrosine kinase. Therefore imatinib was examined for therapeutic efficacy against malignant gastro-intestinal stromal tumors (GIST) Recent articles have drawn attention to the development of new Ph-negative, cytogenetically unrelated clones after therapy of Ph-positive CML with imatinib. Trisomy 8 and monosomy 7 are the most frequent defects, but other aberrations have also been reported. Some of these cytogenetic abnormalities are associated with acute myeloid leukemia and MDS.
