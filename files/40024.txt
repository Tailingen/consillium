Phase II Study of Lenalidomide/Dexamethasone With or Without Elotuzumab for Newly Diagnosed MM Patients in Japan
The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of Lenalidomide/Dexamethasone + Elotuzumab in the subjects with newly diagnosed, previously untreated Multiple Myeloma (MM) in Japan.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Lenalidomide|DRUG: Dexamethasone|BIOLOGICAL: Elotuzumab (BMS-901608)
Objective Response Rate (ORR) of Participants Treated With Elotuzumab + Lenalidomide/Dexamethasone (E-Ld), ORR is the proportion of randomized participants who achieve a stringent complete response (sCR), complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR) or PR as determined by investigator using the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) response criteria.

SCR: CR and normal free light chain (FLC) ratio and no clonal cells in bone marrow; CR: Negative serum and urine on immunofixation, disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas and ≤ 5% plasma cells in bone marrow; VGPR: Serum and urine M-protein detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis or ≥ 90% reduction in serum M-protein and urine M-protein level \< 100 mg/24 hours; PR: ≥ 50% reduction of serum M-Protein and reduction in urinary M-protein by ≥ 90% or to \< 200 mg/24 hours. In addition to the above, if present at baseline a ≥ 50% reduction in the size of soft tissue plasmacytomas is also required., From first dose until documented response (assessed up to February 2017, approximately 24 months)
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is the percentage of randomized participants who achieve a stringent complete response (sCR), complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR) or partial response (PR) as determined by investigator using the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) response criteria.

SCR: CR and normal free light chain (FLC) ratio and no clonal cells in bone marrow; CR: Negative serum and urine on immunofixation, disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas and ≤ 5% plasma cells in bone marrow; VGPR: Serum and urine M-protein detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis or ≥ 90% reduction in serum M-protein and urine M-protein level \< 100 mg/24 hours; PR: ≥ 50% reduction of serum M-Protein and reduction in urinary M-protein by ≥ 90% or to \< 200 mg/24 hours. In addition to the above, if present at baseline a ≥ 50% reduction in the size of soft tissue plasmacytomas is also required., From first dose until documented response, up to approximately 72 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the date of the first documented tumor progression, as determined by the investigator using the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) response criteria, or to death due to any cause, provided death does not occur more than 10 weeks (2 or more assessment visits) after the last tumor assessment. Clinical deterioration will not be considered progression., From randomization to the date of first documented tumor progression or death due to any cause, up to approximately 72 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS) Rate, PFS rate is defined as the percentage of participants who have neither progressed nor died at the specified timepoints, From randomization up to the specified timepoints, up to 3 years
