Evaluate the Mediators of Sensitivity and Resistance to Nivolumab Plus Ipilimumab in Patients With Advanced NSCLCs
The purpose of this study is to closely examine tumor and blood samples from patients treated with nivolumab and ipilimumab in order to try to identify why some patients with lung cancers respond and why some patients do not.
Advanced Stage Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: nivolumab|DRUG: pilimumab
Best Overall Response Rate (Confirmed Partial + Complete Response) Will be Assessed as Part of This Study. Tumor Response Will be Assessed Using RECIST 1.1), confirmed partial + complete response will be assessed as part of this study. Tumor response will be assessed using RECIST 1.1. All responses must be confirmed on subsequent scan to be considered a true response. Tumor assessments will be performed after.6 weeks (+/- 1 week) and subsequently every six week (+/- 1 week) thereafter while on study until week 48. After week 48, tumor assessments will be conducted every 12 weeks (+/- week). Additional tumor assessments may be performed at the discretion of the treating physician., every 6 weeks (+/- 1 week) until week 48
