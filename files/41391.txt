SHR-1210 Combined With Apatinib Mesylate in the Perioperative Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This is a Phase II , Open-label , Investigator-initiated Trail of SHR-1210 (an Anti-PD-1 Inhibitor) in Combination With Apatinib in Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma(HCC).This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SHR-1210 combination with Apatinib as a preoperative treatment of HCC.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: Apatinib Combined With SHR-1210 Injection

This is an Open, Single Arm, Exploratory and Phase II Clinical Trial of Apatinib Combined With SHR-1210 (an Anti-PD-1 Inhibitor) in Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma(HCC) as Perioperative Treatment. we conduct this study in order to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of Apatinib combined with SHR-1210 (an Anti-PD-1 Inhibitor) in treatment of patients with HCC. Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Major pathologic response (MPR), Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: Pathological complete response Rate (pCR), Objective Response(ORR) (According to RECIST Version 1.1), Recurrence-free survival(RFS) and Overall survival rate of 6 months (OS %-6 m). Safety and tolerance will be evaluated by incidence, severity and outcomes of AEs and categorized by severity in accordance with the NCI CTC AE Version 4.0.3.
