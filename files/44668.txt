Color Doppler and Mri Diffusion in Major Salivary Gland Masses
This study intend to evaluate the combined value of ADC and COLOR DOPPLER in differentiating benign and malignant salivary gland tumors in comparison to histopathological findings and its use in preoperative prediction of benign and malignant masses.
Salivary Gland Diseases
DEVICE: MRI|DEVICE: Ultrasound
The ADC values and Color Doppler values (PSV-PI-RI) of major salivary gland masses, The ADC values and Color Doppler values (PSV-PI-RI) of major salivary gland masses will differ according to the nature of the mass determined by histopathological finding, baseline
the study aim to achieve preoperative differentiation between benign and malignant masses of the major salivary glands using the ADC values and Color Doppler values (PSV - PI - RI)
