The untoward medical occurrence does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with treatment. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that results in death; is life-threatening; requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of present hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is a medically important event that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but may jeopardize the participant or may require intervention to prevent one of other outcomes listed in definition above, or involves suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent., From the date of randomization through 30 days after the last dose of study drug up to end of study (up to approximately 9 years)|Number of Participants With Abnormal Serum Chemistry and Hematology Laboratory Values Based on Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), The laboratory values assessment included serum chemistry and hematology. The Serum chemistry assessment included blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, bilirubin (total), urate, lactate dehydrogenase, phosphate, albumin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), glucose, sodium, potassium, calcium, chloride, carbon dioxide (CO2), magnesium, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Hematology assessment included hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet (count), leukocytes with differential neutrophils (ANC). Participants with abnormal serum chemistry laboratory values reported as TEAEs are reported. TEAEs were defined as events that occurred after administration of the first dose of any agent in the study drug regimen and through 30 days after the last dose of any agent in the study drug regimen., From the date of randomization through 30 days after the last dose of study drug up to end of study (up to approximately 9 years)|Change From Baseline in Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) Measured by European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer-Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ)-C30 Scale Total Score, EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale was used to assess HRQOL in cancer participants and contains 30 items. Subscale with individual items include physical functioning items 1-5, role functioning items 6-7, emotional functioning items 21-24, cognitive functioning items 20, 25, social functioning items 26-27, quality of life items 29-30, fatigue items 10, 12, 18, nausea and vomiting items 14-15, pain items 9, 19, dyspnoea item 8, insomnia item 11, appetite loss item 13, constipation item 16, diarrhoea item 17, financial difficulties item 28. Raw scores were converted into scale scores ranging from 0 to 100.
