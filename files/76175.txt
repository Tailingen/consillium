Treatment of Refractory/Relapsed Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma With TriCAR-T_CD19
This is a single arm, open-label, single-center, phase 1/2 study, to determine the safety and efficacy of TriCAR-T-CD19, an autologous tri-functional anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-positive T cell therapy, in refractory/Relapsed Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL).

The tri-functional anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor contains an anti-CD19 scFv, a PD-L1 blocker, and a cytokine complex, enabling the TriCAR-T-CD19 to simultaneously targeting the CD19 positive NHL，blocking the inhibitory PD-L1 signal and stimulating T/NK cell activation and expansion.
