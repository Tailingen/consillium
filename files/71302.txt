Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection Versus Esophagectomy for Early Esophageal Carcinoma
Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a minimally invasive alternative to esophagectomy for early esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (EESCC), The data of EESCC patients who received ESD or esophagectomy were retrospectively analyzed,The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of ESD and esophagectomy in EESCC,Risk factors affecting the prognosis of patients with early esophageal squamous cell carcinoma were analyzed.
Esophageal Cancer
PROCEDURE: Endoscopic submucosal dissection|PROCEDURE: Esophagectomy
overall survival (OS), OS was measured from the date of ESD or esophagectomy until death from any cause, 10 years|Disease specific survival (DSS), DSS was measured from the date of ESD or esophagectomy until death resulting from ESCC, 10 years|Recurrence free survival (RFS), RFS was measured from the date of ESD or esophagectomy until the first recurrence or metastasis, 10 years
postoperative complications, Major postoperative complications includes bleeding, infection, and perforation，stricture and anastomotic leakage, adverse events assessed by blood tests, imageological examination and Endoscopic evaluation. Complications were graded according to the Clavien-Dindo classification system. The higher the complication grade, the more serious., 30 days|R0 resection, R0 resection was defined as horizontal and vertical margins free from both cancerous and precancerous tissues (HGIN), and without evidence of LVI. Pathological assessment was performed independently by two pathologists., 15 days|adjuvant therapy, During follow-up, record whether Adjuvant therapy (i.e., additional endoscopy/surgery, radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy) was administered., 10 years|operation time, Time from start to finish of operation, measured in minutes, 12 hours|Post-operative hospitalization days, Date of discharge minus date of operation,measured in days, 30 days

Overall survival (OS), disease specific survival (DSS), recurrence free survival (RFS), and procedure-related variables were compared between ESD and esophagectomy patients.Risk factors affecting the prognosis of patients with early esophageal squamous cell carcinoma were analyzed.
