FSRT in Breast Cancer Patients With Brain Metastases
Brain metastasis accounted for 10-15% of all breast cancer patients and even higher in patients with triple negative and HER2 overexpressed subtype. Stereotactic radiation is the standard option for patients with 1-4 brain metastases. Among patients with 1-4 brain metastases, many studies suggest that stereotactic radiation results in fewer neurologic side effects than whole brain radiation. Also, several studies had demonstrated that 5-10 lesions had similar overall survival by using whole brain radiotherapy or stereotactic radiotherapy. Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy(FSRT) is increasingly administered in the brain metastatic patients and retrospective studies had shown that FSRT had better local control and lower brain radiation necrosis than single fraction stereotactic radiation. Therefore, In this study, we explore to treat 1-10 brain metastasis lesion in breast cancer patients with FSRT.

RADIATION: Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy(FSRT)
intracranial local tumor control rate, 2 years
Intracranial distant metastasis rate, intracranial distant metastasis after FSRT will be determined by the development of intracranial distant metastasis is determined by new lesions outside of the irradiated area., 2 years|Intracranial Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Time from the date of radiotherapy to the investigator-determined date of progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, 2 years|overall survival(OS), time from the date of informed consent until to the date of death, regardless of the cause of death., 3 years|Adverse events, AEs were graded according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.3, 2 years
Breast cancer patients with 1-10 brain metastasis will be treated with FSRT for brain metastasis. 3 to 5 fractions and 8Gy per fraction will be used for these patients based on the lesion number and volume.
