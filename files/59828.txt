Zanubrutinib Combined With R-CHOP in Newly-diagnosed Intravascular Large B-cell Lymphoma
This is a prospective single-arm phase II study, and the purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of zanubrutinib combined with R-CHOP regimen in newly diagnosed primary intraocular lymphoma. Progression-free survival (PFS) of the cohort is the primary endpoint.
Intravascular Large B-Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Zanubrutinib|DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Epirubicin|DRUG: Vindesine|DRUG: Prednisone
2 years progression-free survival, 2 years progression-free survival was calculated from the date of therapy until death from lymphoma or 2-year follow up without relapsing., from the date of treatment to the subject finished his 2 years follow-up phase or the disease relapsed or the death due to lymphoma
overall response rate(ORR), ORR was calculated by the proportion of patients who achieved complete remission and partial remission., 6 weeks after the end of 8 cycles of induction (each cycle is 21 days).
All the eligible patients will be treated with ZR-CHOP regimen (Rituximab 375mg/m2 IV d1, cyclophosphamide 750mg/m2 IV d1, epirubicin 70mg/m2 IV d1, vindesine 4mg IV d1ï¼Œprednison 60mg/m2 d1-5 PO). An interim evaluation will be performed after 4 cycles, the patients who achieve CR or PR will receive another 4 cycles of ZR-CHOP.

The patients with stable disease (SD) or progressed disease (PD) will withdraw from the trial and receive salvage regimens.

During the following-up, surveillance physical examination and CT scans should be performed every 6 months for 2 years to determine the status of disease.
