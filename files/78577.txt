Improving Supportive Care For Patients With Thoracic Malignancies
The purpose of this study is to use a proactive approach to improve symptom management of patients with thoracic malignancies and ensure receipt of evidence-based cancer care delivery. In this pilot study, the investigators propose to evaluate the feasibility of using outbound, proactive telephone symptom assessment strategies and ensuring evidence-based care receipt and measure the efficacy of this approach on patient satisfaction with their care, patient activation, quality of life and use of healthcare resources.

The investigators have previously shown in previous work that patients and caregivers who experience thoracic malignancies express poor symptom management that result in utilization of healthcare resources after-hours for symptoms that could have been prevented if assessed more proactively and prospectively. Currently, there are limited proactive approaches to prospectively identify and intervene on patient-reported symptoms. The purpose of this study is to enhance symptom assessment strategies by using a proactive assessment approach to improve symptom relief for patients with thoracic malignancies.

The investigators will test whether a proactive telephone symptom assessment and management strategy is feasible and can facilitate early patient report of their symptoms and intervention. The knowledge gained from this approach will be used to identify solutions that can be scaled nationally to improve patient-reported symptom management and patient satisfaction with their clinical care.
