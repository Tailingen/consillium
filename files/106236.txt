The primary objective of this study will assess safety and treatment activity of datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) in combination with pembrolizumab with or without 4 cycles of platinum chemotherapy in participants with advanced or metastatic NSCLC who have either been previously treated or are treatment naïve in a metastatic setting.

Two dose levels of Dato-DXd (4.0 mg/kg and 6.0 mg/kg) will be studied in combination with 200 mg fixed-dose pembrolizumab in 6 study cohorts. This study will be conducted sequentially and dose escalation will occur according to lower dose to higher dose in the same combination regimen (4.0 mg/kg to 6.0 mg/kg) and from 2-drug combination (Dato-DXd and pembrolizumab) to 3-drug combination regimen (Dato-DXd, pembrolizumab, and carboplatin or cisplatin).
