A Study of MPT-0118 in Subjects With Advanced or Metastatic Refractory Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1/1b open-label, dose-escalation, and cohort expansion study with BID (tablet) oral dose of MPT-0118 in subjects with advanced or metastatic refractory solid tumors.

The study will be conducted in 3 parts:

* Part A: MPT-0118 dose-escalation
* Part B: MPT-0118 dose-escalation in combination with pembrolizumab
* Part C: Cohort expansion of MPT-0118 in combination with pembrolizumab

Part A: To determine the MTD or the RP2D of MPT-0118, The incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) qualifying as protocol-defined DLTs in Cycle 1 will guide the establishment of the protocol-defined RP2D and/or MTD., 1 cycle / 28 days|Part B: To determine the MTD or the RP2D of MPT-0118 + pembrolizumab, The incidence and severity of TEAEs qualifying as protocol-defined DLTs in Cycle 1 will guide the establishment of the protocol-defined RP2D and/or MTD., 1 cycle / 28 days|Part C: Number of subjects with TEAEs as assessed by NCI-CTCAE v5.0, Incidence of TEAEs will be used to assess the safety of MPT-0118 + pembrolizumab, Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Part C: Objective response rate (ORR) based on RECIST v1.1 and iRECIST, Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Part C: Duration of response (DoR) based on RECIST v1.1 and iRECIST, Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Part C: Progression-free survival (PFS) based on RECIST v1.1 and iRECIST, Through study completion, an average of 1 year
Part A and B: Maximum plasma concentration of MPT-0118, 1 cycle / 28 days|Part A and B: ORR based on RECIST v 1.1 and iRECIST, Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Part A and B: DoR based on RECIST v 1.1 and iRECIST, Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Part A and B: PFS based on RECIST v 1.1 and iRECIST, Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Part C: Assessment of Overall Survival, Through study completion, an average of 1 year
MPT-0118 will be administered orally twice daily (BID). Pembrolizumab will be administered intravenously (IV) at a dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks.
