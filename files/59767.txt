Sienna+® Injection Time Study 4 Arms
Patients with breast cancer normally undergo a labelling with radioactive tracer typically 1 day before surgery, which enables the surgeon to localize the sentinel lymph node during surgery. This pilot study uses the magnetic Sentimag technique to mark the lymph nodes either 1 or 4-6 days before surgery to investigate the concordance with the standard technique.

Sienna+® is injected either 1 day or 4-6 days before surgery, either retro-mamillary or peri-tumorally:

* Sienna+® retro-mamillary 1 day before surgery: 10 patients
* Sienna+® peri-tumorally 1 day before surgery: 10 patients
* Sienna+® retro-mamillary 4-6 days before surgery: 10 patients
* Sienna+® peri-tumorally 4-6 days before surgery: 10 patients In each case, Technetium as standard technique is employed according to the gold standard protocol one day before surgery.

The Sentimag device is used during surgery to detect the lymph nodes in parallel to the standard technique.
