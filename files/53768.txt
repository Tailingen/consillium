ADC-1013 First-in-Human Study
The purpose of this study is to determine whether ADC-1013 (an agonistic human monoclonal IgG1 anti-CD40 antibody) is safe and tolerable when administered intratumorally (as repeated injections directly into the tumor tissue) or intravenously (as repeated doses directly into a vein) in patients with advanced solid tumors.
Neoplasms|Solid Tumors
BIOLOGICAL: ADC-1013
Safety and tolerability of increasing doses of ADC-1013, assessed by medical review of AE reports and vital signs measurements (blood pressure, pulse rate, body temperature), physical examinations, ECGs and clinical laboratory tests., Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose of ADC-1013 administered intratumorally or intravenously will be defined., From start of study until end of study (appr 28 days after last dose)
Pharmacokinetics of ADC-1013 after single and repeated administrations assessed by the following parameters: Cmax, Tmax, elimination half-life, AUC0-âˆž, total serum clearance (CL) and the volume of distribution at steady state (Vss)., From first dose until 55 days after first dose|Immunogenicity of ADC-1013 after repeated administrations assessed by anti-drug antibody (ADA) titers in serum, From first dose until end of study (appr 28 days after last dose)|Clinical efficacy (i.e. anti-tumor activity) of ADC-1013 assessed by immune-related RECIST (irRECIST) and RECIST 1.1., From start of study until end of study (appr 28 days after last dose)
The purpose of this study is to determine whether ADC-1013 (an agonistic human monoclonal IgG1 anti-CD40 antibody) is safe and tolerable when administered intratumorally (as repeated injections directly into the tumor tissue) or intravenously (as repeated doses directly into a vein) in patients with advanced solid tumors.
