Transcriptomes Breast, Ovarian and Leukocyte Hereditary Genes Predisposing to Breast and / or Ovarian Cancer
This is a case-control study of molecular diagnostics.

This study requires two steps:

* The first part of the study will be conducted on a population of 20 women without breast cancer and, or ovarian family (Healthy Volunteers controls)
* The second part of the study will be conducted on a population of 50 patients predisposed to familial breast and, or ovarian cancer compared to 20 controls .

For analysis of leucocytes of the patients, a blood sample collected in a prior study (EXSAL study, ID-RCB 2009-A00833-54) will be used.

Difference between the average rate of inclusion of exons (exon inclusion mean level) messenger RNA leucocyte of patients and the controls (without matching), at inclusion
Difference between the average rate of inclusion of exons (exon inclusion mean level) leukocyte messenger RNAs and, the mRNA of breast tissue in healthy women (with pairing)., at inclusion
This study requires two steps:

- The first part of the study will be conducted on a population of 20 women free of breast cancer and, or ovarian Family (healthy volunteers controls) and without a known family history of breast and or ovarian cancer.

Mapping the level of blood (leukocytes) and the breast tissue will be drawn for the same individual on the physiological profiles splicing of the messenger RNA of genes involved in this predisposition, targeted by high-throughput sequencing of RNA (RNASeq).

A direct comparison of RNA splicing patterns between blood and breast tissue from the same witness will detect any differences between these two tissues.

-The second part of the study will be conducted on a population of 50 patients predisposed to familial breast and, or ovarian cancer compared to 20 controls with no known family history of breast and, or ovarian cancer.

Analysis of the results will highlight potential splicing abnormalities.
