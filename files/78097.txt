Efficacy Assessment of a Novel 3D Cartography-based Targeted Focal Microwave Therapy in Men With Localized Intermediate-risk Prostate Cancer
Multicenter, prospective, European, single-arm, open-label, 12-month follow-up clinical trial. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a 3D cartography-based targeted microwave ablation for the treatment of the index lesion in patients with intermediate risk prostate cancer.

European and American guidelines recommend several therapeutic alternatives: radical surgical treatment, external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy. However, whole-gland treatment induces significant morbidity and burden on quality of life. Targeted treatments of the index tumor are currently under investigation to decrease morbidity while proposing active treatment.

The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of a novel ablation treatment using microwaves, delivered transrectally or transperineally under real-time guidance with MRI-transrectal ultrasound image registration. The index tumor will be detected with prostate MRI and characterized with targeted biopsies using Organ Based Tracking (OBT) fusion with the TRINITY system (KOELIS, Meylan, France). The same system will be used to identify the index lesion and guide the targeted microwave ablation performed with the TATO3 device (Biomedical Srl, Florence, Italy).

All patients will undergo biopsy at 12 months of follow-up. A biopsy session will also be performed at 6 months, but only for patients with imaging results suspicious for cancer within the ablated area on the mpMRI.
