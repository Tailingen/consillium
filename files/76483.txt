Analgesia Regimens Following Trans-sphenoidal Surgery for Pituitary Tumors
A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention trial involving 100 treated subjects undergoing endonasal trans-sphenoidal (ENTS) resection of pituitary lesion. Subjects will be randomized into two groups: 50 treated in the opioid-sparing arm and 50 treated in the standard post-operative medication arm.
Pituitary Tumor|Pain
DRUG: IV Caldolor|DRUG: IV Placebo
Comparison of Mean Pain Scores Between Two Arms (Measured Every 4 Hours Over 48 Hour), Comparison of pain scores between two arms using Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for Pain. Units of measure are 0=No Pain, 1=Annoying, 2=Mild Pain, 3=Troublesome, 4=Nagging Pain, Uncomfortable, 5=Distressing, 6=Miserable, 7=Horrible, 8=Intense, Dreadful, 9=Unbearable, 10=Worst Possible Pain. Higher values represent a worse outcome. There are no subscales., mean pain score over 48 hours
Breakthrough Narcotic Requirement, Rescue narcotic in both groups will be recorded and compared using a standard equianalgesic oral morphine equivalent (OME) calculation, until discharge from hospital, an expected stay of 2 days|Other Adverse Events, Epistaxis, potentially related to IV ibuprofen, will be compared between two groups, until discharge from hospital, an expected stay of 2 days
Total Cost of Hospital Charges Compared Between Two Arms, Total hospital costs for patients in IV ibuprofen arm compared to IV placebo arm, until discharge from hospital, an expected stay of 2 days|The Number of Participants Who Have a Bowel Movement During Hospitalization in Both Groups, patients with one or more bowel movement(s) in the first 48 hours after surgery, until discharge from hospital, an expected stay of 2 days|Length of Stay in Hospital Compared Between Two Arms, Length of hospital stay from time of surgery to time of discharge., until discharge from hospital, an expected stay of 2 days|Total Number of Doses of Any Anti-emetic Required Post-operatively in Both Groups, Use of antiemetics in first 48 hours after surgery, until discharge from hospital, an expected stay of 2 days
Post-operative pain control is a common concern patients have when they consider undergoing a surgical procedure. Although effective for treating acute pain, opioid analgesics are also associated with dose-dependent adverse effects, including constipation, nausea and vomiting, altered mental status, and respiratory depression, all of which have been shown to increase patient length of stay. The use of non-opioid analgesics with different mechanisms of actions for acute pain control via a multi-modal approach is efficacious in reducing opioid consumption, decreasing the incidence of adverse effects, improving patient satisfaction and recovery time, and decreasing hospital costs.Certain minimally invasive procedures may afford many patients the opportunity to achieve adequate post-operative pain control with minimal to no requirement of opioid analgesics, thereby sparing the patient known adverse effects that can increase length of stay and costs. The ENTS approach for resection of pituitary tumors is the standard surgical procedure for these lesions, and is associated with pain that is more easily managed post-operatively, making it an ideal procedure for an opioid-sparing post-operative pain regimen. Anecdotally, the investigators note that in the investigator's post-operative pituitary patient population that post-operative pain can frequently be adequately managed with scheduled non-opioid analgesics, often without requiring breakthrough opioid doses. Another safe and effective non-opioid analgesic that is widely used in multi-modal pain management for moderate pain is IV Caldolor (ibuprofen). After literature review, the investigators were unable to find a study that had attempted to use an opioid-sparing analgesic regimen for post-operative pain control following ENTS approach for resection of pituitary tumors.
