M9466 in Combination With Topoisomerase 1 Inhibitors-based Regimens in Advanced Solid Tumors and Colorectal Cancer (DDRiver 511)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and preliminary clinical activity of M9466 in combination with topoisomerase 1 inhibitors-based regimens. As such the combination with FOLFIRI (folinic acid, fluorouracil, irinotecan) and Bevacizumab will be evaluated in participants with colorectal cancer, to establish the M9466 maximum tolerated dose if observed and the recommended dose for expansion.

Study Duration: After a Screening period of up to 28 days, enrolled participants will remain in the study until they have completed all the study visits or until they withdraw consent, are lost to follow-up, or die.

Visit Frequency: The participants will come for a Screening Visit and 1 to 2 visits per treatment cycle. After end of study intervention period, the participants will come for an End of Treatment Visit and a Safety Follow-up Visit.
