This randomized phase II trial targets early-stage breast cancer (stage II-III) with preoperative chemotherapy (NAC). It compares standard treatment with multiple experimental treatments using an adaptive design, allowing new treatments to be added during or after the trial. Patients are classified by subtype and randomized between standard and experimental treatments.

The trial is flexible, permitting single or combination new drug therapies and incorporating circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) evaluation for precise efficacy and prognosis prediction.
