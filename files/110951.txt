Study to Assess Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Antitumor Activity of AZD4573 in Relapsed/Refractory Haematological Malignancies
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and preliminary antitumor activity of AZD4573 in subjects with relapsed or refractory haematological malignancies.
Relapsed or Refractory Haematological Malignancies Including|Acute Myeloid Leukemia|Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia|Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|High Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome|Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia|Richter's Syndrome|B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma|T-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma|Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma|Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: AZD4573
Incidence of adverse events, Number of subjects with adverse events as a measure of safety and tolerability including changes in vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), safety and laboratory parameters, At every treatment and follow up visit from the time of informed consent up to 8 months initially or if clinical benefit continues, until disease progression. Expected to be for 12 months|Dose limiting toxicities, DLTs will be determined from monitoring adverse events (AEs), and abnormal laboratory tests (clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis), physical examinations, vital signs (blood pressure and pulse), and electrocardiogram (ECG)., From day 1 of first cycle for a period of 8 weeks for cohorts 1 and 2, and for a period of 4 weeks for cohort 3 and for any other subsequent cohort that may be opened|Maximum tolerated dose, After completion of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) period (8/4 weeks) for the maximum dose cohort
Maximum observed plasma concentration of AZD4573, The concentration of AZD4573 and its metabolites in blood will be determined (Cmax will be derived)., For Cohorts 1 and 2: Over 8 weeks (from dosing Day 1 of ramp-up Cycle A until Day 1 of the target dose Cycle 1). For Cohort 3: Over 4 weeks (from dosing Day 1 of ramp-up Cycle A until Day 1 of the target dose Cycle 1)|Area under the concentration-time curve for plasma concentrations of AZD4573, The Area under the curve of AZD4573 and its metabolites in blood will be determined, For Cohorts 1 and 2: Over 8 weeks (from dosing Day 1 of ramp-up Cycle A until Day 1 of the target dose Cycle 1). For Cohort 3: Over 4 weeks (from dosing Day 1 of ramp-up Cycle A until Day 1 of the target dose Cycle 1).|Volume of distribution (Vd)., The concentration of AZD4573 and its metabolites in blood will be determined. Volume of distribution (Vd) is the apparent volume in which a drug is distributed (i.e., the parameter relating drug concentration to drug amount in the body)., For Cohorts 1 and 2: Over 8 weeks (from dosing Day 1 of ramp-up Cycle A until Day 1 of the target dose Cycle 1). For Cohort 3: Over 4 weeks (from dosing Day 1 of ramp-up Cycle A until Day 1 of the target dose Cycle 1).|Clearance (CL)., The concentration of AZD4573 and its co-former in blood will be determined. Clearance (CL) is the volume of plasma cleared of the drug per unit time., For Cohorts 1 and 2: Over 8 weeks (from dosing Day 1 of ramp-up Cycle A until Day 1 of the target dose Cycle 1). For Cohort 3: Over 4 weeks (from dosing Day 1 of ramp-up Cycle A until Day 1 of the target dose Cycle 1).|Antitumor activity of AZD4573 in patients by assessing overall response rate (ORR)., To assess proportion of patients with anti tumor response to AZD4573. response assessment by Cheson (2014) criteria for for NHL, SLL, T-cell lymphoma and Richter syndrome, IWG criteria for CLL (Hallek 2008) and myeloma (Palumbo 2014), AML response criteria for AML (Doner 2010), SWOG (2016) criteria for ALL and MDS and CMML by IWG (Savona 2015) .Response will be evaluated every 4-12 weeks (based on disease type) until progression, From time of first dose until discontinuation of AZD4573 expected to be for up to 12 months|Duration of response (DOR), To assess the duration of anti tumor activity of AZD4573. To assess the progression free survival of AZD4573. response assessment by Cheson (2014) criteria for for NHL, SLL, T-cell lymphoma and Richter syndrome, IWG criteria for CLL (Hallek 2008) and myeloma (Palumbo 2014), AML response criteria for AML (Doner 2010), SWOG (2016) criteria for ALL and MDS and CMML by IWG (Savona 2015) . Response will be evaluated every 4-12 weeks (based on disease type) until progression, From time of first dose until disease progression expected to be for up to 12 months|Antitumor activity of AZD4573 in patients by assessing overall survival (OS)., Proportion of patients alive at 12 months post treatment start or other defined timepoints, From time of first dose until death or study end whatever is earlier expected to be for up to 12 months|Minimal Residual Disease (MRD), For applicable histologies/disease indications (e.g., CLL) using IWG criteria for response assessment every 4-12 weeks from start of treatment., From time of first dose until discontinuation of AZD4573 expected to be for up to 12 months|Progression free survival (PFS), To assess the progression free survival of AZD4573. response assessment by Cheson (2014) criteria for for NHL, SLL, T-cell lymphoma and Richter syndrome, IWG criteria for CLL (Hallek 2008) and myeloma (Palumbo 2014), AML response criteria for AML (Doner 2010), SWOG (2016) criteria for ALL and MDS and CMML by IWG (Savona 2015) . Response will be evaluated every 4-12 weeks (based on disease type) until progression, From time of first dose until first observation of progression expected to be for up to 12 months
