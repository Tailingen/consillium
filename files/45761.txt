Full-spectrum Endoscopy in Colorectal Cancer Screening
The purpose of this study is to compare the adenoma detection rates of full-spectrum endoscopy versus standard forward-viewing colonoscopy in colorectal cancer screening programme.
Colorectal Cancer
PROCEDURE: colonoscopy procedure
adenoma detection rate in the two different colonoscopies, number of colonoscopies at wich one or more histologically confirmed adenomas were found divided by the total number of colonoscopies performed in the same time period., one week
time to caecal intubation in each group, time to reach appendicular orifice, one week|total procedure time in each group, time since the begining of the procedure till is totally finish, one week|Adverse events, Any inmediatly complication, one week|advance adenoma rate in each group, 10mm or greater in size, villous component or high grade dysplasia, one week|polyp detection rate in right and left colon in each group, one week|polyp retrieval rate in each group, proportion of resected polyps that were retrieved and sent for histologically analysis, one week|caecal intubation rate in each group, proportion of all colonoscopic procedures in which the caecum, terminal ileum was reached, one week|colonoscopy withdrawal time, average time taken withdraw the colonoscope from the caecal pole to the anus., one week
Colorectal cancer is the third most common neoplasia and the second leading cause of cancer death in West countries. Colonoscopy is the gold standard for prevention of colorectal cancer disease. Screening for colorectal cancer with biennial faecal occult blood testing is a widely used strategy followed by colonoscopy for those with a positive test. Colonoscopy identifies polyps during the procedure as well as polyp removal in order to prevent progression to cancer. Although, interval cancer appears after a colonoscopy because of 22-28% of polyp missed rates. Advanced Technology may improve adenoma detection rates so decrease interval cancer and reduce mortally. Full-spectrum endoscopy with 330ยบ angle vision decrease adenoma miss rate in general population.

The investigators conducted a randomized trial in patients from colorectal cancer screening programme (aged 50-69 years) after faecal immunological test positive. One arm the colonoscopy is performed with standard forward view colonoscopy (170ยบ angle view) and the other arm is performed with full-spectrum endoscopy (EndoChoice) (330ยบ angle view)
