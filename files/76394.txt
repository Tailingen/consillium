A Study of IMMH-010 in Patients With Advanced Malignant Solid Tumors
Phase I study of IMMH-010 in patients with advanced malignant solid tumors
Malignant Neoplasms
DRUG: IMMH-010
Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), To identify the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in dose escalation study., Part A Dose escalation study at the end of Cycle 1 (Cycle1 is 21 days)|Adverse reaction rate, Observe all the participants in any adverse events occurred during the period of clinical research, including clinical symptoms and signs of life, an abnormal in laboratory tests, record its clinical characteristics, severity, occurrence time, duration, treatment and prognosis, and determine its and the correlation between test drugs. NCI-CTCAE 5.0 standard was used to evaluate drug safety., From date of singing informed consent until the 30 days after the last study dose or the start date of a new anti-cancer therapy, whichever came first.
Cmax, Peak plasma concentration., Part A Dose escalation study: At the end of Cycle1(Cycle1 is 21 days), Part B: At the end of Cycle0(Cycle0 is 4 days).|Tmax, Time to peak plasma concentration., Part A Dose escalation study: At the end of Cycle1(Cycle1 is 21 days), Part B: At the end of Cycle0(Cycle0 is 4 days).|AUC, Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve., Part A Dose escalation study: At the end of Cycle1(Cycle1 is 21 days), Part B: At the end of Cycle0(Cycle0 is 4 days).|Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who have best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) at the time of data cutoff as assessed by RECIST 1.1., From date of first dose until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first (up to approximately 2 years).|Duration of response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the first documentation of CR or PR to the date of first documentation of disease progression or death (whichever occurs first) as assessed by RECIST 1.1., From date of first dose until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first (up to approximately 2 years).|Disease control rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of participants who have BOR of CR or PR or stable disease (SD) at the time of data cutoff as assessed by RECIST 1.1., From date of first dose until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first (up to approximately 2 years).|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the first study dose date to the date of first documentation of disease progression as assessed by RECIST 1.1., From date of first dose until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first (up to approximately 2 years).
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of single-dose and multi-dose IMMH-010 in patients with advanced solid tumors, et al.
