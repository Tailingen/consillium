Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of Simmiparib in Patients With Malignant Advanced Solid Tumor
Phase I dose escalating trial. Primary objectives of this study are to assess the safety and tolerability of Simmiparib following single and multiple oral doses in patients with advanced solid malignancies, to determine the maximum tolerance dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT), and pharmacokinetic profile.

The Secondary objective is to observe the preliminary antitumor effect of Simmiparib.
