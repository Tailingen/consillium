Ph I/II Study of CAR19 Regulatory T Cells (CAR19-tTreg) for R/R CD19+ B-ALL
This is a single-center, single-arm, interventional phase I/II trial to evaluate the safety profile and potential efficacy of allogeneic CAR19 regulatory T cells (CAR19-tTreg) in adults with relapsed/refractory (R/R) CD19+ B Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (B-ALL).

The study consists of two components. The dose finding component is a modified version of a Phase I trial and the extended component is a modified Phase II trial.
Lymphoma Leukemia
DRUG: allogeneic CAR19 regulatory T cells (CAR19-tTreg)|DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide
Dose Finding of CAR19-tTregs, To identify the MTD of CAR19-tTregs defined asthe dose level that most closely corresponds to a dose limiting toxicity rate(DLT) less than or equal to 25%. Using grade 3-5 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5 (CTCAEv5) Statistical Analysis: The proportion of patients with ORR, CR and adverse events by day 28 will be estimated by simple proportions with 95% confidence intervals, 28 days after CAR19-tTregs administrations|Measure CAR19-tTregs efficacy, Efficacy estimate as measured by overall response rate, 28 days after CAR19-tTregs administrations
Incidence of CR, Report number patients that achieved complete response (CR), 28 days after CAR19-tTregs administrations|Incidence of grade 3-4 cytokine release syndrome (CRS), Evaluated using the American Society of Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) CRS consensus grading system, 28 days after CAR19-tTregs administrations|Incidence of immune cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), Report the count of neurotoxicities based on the ICANS system., 28 days after CAR19-tTregs administrations|Incidence of relapse in patients achieving complete response (CR), Report the count of relapses out of those that achieved complete reponse, 1 year after treatment|Incidence of relapse in patients achieving complete (CR), Report the count (as proportions) of relapses out of those that achieved complete re, Day +100 after treatment|Probability of survival and event free survival, The analysis of overall survival will use death as the event, and the analysis of event-free survival will use the earliest of no response, relapse, or death as the event. Patients who do not have an event will have their data censored for the analyses at the date at which they were last known to be alive. Finally, probabilities will be measured using Kaplan-Meier curves, 6 months|Probability of survival and event free survival, The analysis of overall survival will use death as the event, and the analysis of event-free survival will use the earliest of no response, relapse, or death as the event. Patients who do not have an event will have their data censored for the analyses at the date at which they were last known to be alive. Finally, probabilities will be measured using Kaplan-Meier curves, 1 year
