Safety and Efficacy Study of Single-port Robotic Versus Multi-port Robotic Radical Rectal Cancer Surgery
This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of single-port robotic surgery compared to multi-port robotic surgery for rectal cancer.

Surgical robots were born in the 1980s and have the advantages of being precise, flexible, less invasive and remotely operable than traditional surgical methods. The single-port robot is a further extension of minimally invasive surgery by placing multiple instruments through a single incision. Most studies have reported on the perioperative outcomes of robotic versus conventional laparoscopic surgery in the treatment of colorectal cancer. However, there are limited data comparing the perioperative outcomes of single-port robotics and multi-port robotics in the treatment of colorectal cancer，especially in rectal cancer surgery. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of single-port robotic surgery compared to multi-port robotic surgery for rectal cancer.
