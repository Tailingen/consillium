Clinical Trial Assessing the Efficacy of Capsaicin Patch (QutenzaÂ®) in Cancer Patients With Neuropathic Pain
In the oncology area, neuropathic pains are relatively frequent and can be induced by surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy. In usual practice, some units are using qutenza in order to reduce neuropathic pain even though using of this patch for a population of cancer patients has never been demonstrated so far in a prospective study. The present prospective study proposes to evaluate the qutenza efficacy in peripheric neuropathic pain in cancer patients.

Drugs for neuropathic pains are generally represented by antidepressants, anti-epileptics, opioids, lidocaine patch. However, these drugs can frequently be insufficient, and/or can lead to side effects. Qutenza (8% capsaicin patch) presents an interesting alternative.

Qutenza efficacy has been shown in five principal studies conducted on 1988 adults affected by moderate or severe neuropathic pains. All patients presented Postherpetic neuralgia, or HIV associated therapy, or painful diabetic peripheric neuropathies. These studies led to qutenza approbation in Europe and in States in 2009.

In oncology, neuropathic pains are relatively frequent and can be induced by the three big actors of the anti-cancerous therapeutic arsenal (surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy). In usual practice, some units are usually using qutenza, but the use of this patch for this kind of patients has not been shown in a prospective study. Advantages of this treatment are numerous, and results presented in other therapeutic area are encouraging its use in oncology.

The present prospective study proposes to evaluate the qutenza efficacy in peripheric neuropathic pain in cancer patients.
