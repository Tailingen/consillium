Pharmacokinetic and Efficacy Study of Nordihydroguaiaretic Acid (NDGA) in Non Metastatic Recurrent Prostate Cancer
This is a Phase II, single center study measuring the pharmacokinetic parameters of NDGA administration and assessing the proportion of patients who experience a 50% decline in PSA.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Nordihydroguaiaretic Acid (NDGA)
Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Response According to Consensus Criteria, Participants who experienced a PSA decline of at least 50%, confirmed by a second PSA value 4 or more weeks later. The reference PSA for decline was a PSA measured within 2 weeks of beginning study treatment. If at most 1 PSA response was observed among the first 12 patients, then accrual would stop and the trial would close for futility., Monthly, up to 29 months
This study is a phase II trial of NDGA in patients with hormone-sensitive non-metastatic prostate cancer with a pharmacokinetics component. The first six patients enrolled will be treated with a single 750 mg dose of oral NDGA on day -7 with measurement of pharmacokinetic parameters over eight hours after the dose, then begin treatment with 2000 mg of oral NDGA daily. Every four weeks, measurement of pharmacokinetic parameters at steady state will be done for all patients. All patients will continue dosing with NDGA and will be followed for PSA response and for safety. Measurement of pharmacokinetics for a 750 mg dose has been chosen to evaluate levels with the dosage that patients will be taking at one time point during the day (this is roughly one-third of the daily dose, which is administered in three divided doses).
