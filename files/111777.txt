The Safety and Efficacy of CART-19 Cells in B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (B-ALL).
This is a study for patients who have been previously treated for B-ALL. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and feasibility of CART-19 cells to the patients with relapsed and refractory CD19+ B-ALL.
B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Fludarabine|BIOLOGICAL: CART-19 cells
safety as assessed by the occurrence of study related adverse events., monitor the occurrence of study related adverse events., 6 months
efficacy, anti-tumor activity of CART-19 cells will be determined in a follow-on study, 2 years|duration of CART-19, Determine duration of in vivo survival of CART-19 cells., 2 years
Subjects will be staged and the suitability of their T cells for CART-19 manufacturing will be determined at entry phase,. Subjects will be collected large numbers of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) for CART-19 manufacturing. The T cells will be purified from the PBMC, transduced with CART-19 lentiviral vector, expanded in vitro and then administered to subjects.

Subjects will have blood tests to assess safety and efficacy, and persistence of the CART-19 cells at regular intervals through four weeks after their last infusion of the study. Following the 6 months of intensive follow-up, subjects will be evaluated quarterly for two years with a physical examination, blood tests, bone marrow aspirate, minimal residual disease (MRD) and persistence of CART-19. Following this evaluation, subjects will be evaluated health problems every year for an additional thirteen years.
