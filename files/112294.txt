Copper Cu 64 PSMA I&T PET Imaging in Men With Newly Diagnosed Prostate Cancer
This is a prospective, open-label Phase 3 study to evaluate copper Cu 64 PSMA I\&T injection for PET/CT imaging in patients with newly diagnosed unfavorable intermediate high-risk, high-risk or very high-risk prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer|Prostate Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: Copper Cu 64 PSMA I&T
Sensitivity, Determine the presence of metastatic pelvic lymph nodes relative to histopathology reference standard. At least one positive pelvic lymph node on the PET scan and one positive lymph node as determined by histopathology on the same side of the pelvis (left or right) will be counted a true positive at the patient level., 4 Hours|Specificity, Determine the absence of metastatic pelvic lymph nodes relative to histopathology reference standard. Negative pelvic lymph node on the PET scan and negative pelvic lymph nodes as determined by histopathology on the same side of the pelvis (Left or Right) will be counted a true negative at the patient level., 4 Hours
Inter-reader and intra-reader agreement of copper Cu 64 PSMA I&T PET/CT interpretation on a per-patient basis, Reader kappa statistics of copper Cu 64 PSMA I\&T PET/CT scan interpretation by the blinded independent readers., 4 Hours|Incidence of adverse events in copper Cu 64 PSMA I&T injection, Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) will be assessed and graded using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0., At time of dose administration up to 72 Hours
Determine the relationship of Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) level, Gleason score, and the diagnostic performance of copper Cu 64 PSMA I&T PET/CT, Correlation of sensitivity, specificity, detection rate, and Positive Predictive Value (PPV) to baseline PSA and unfavorable intermediate-risk, high-risk or very high-risk at the time of prostatectomy., 4 Hours|Assess PPV of lesions on copper Cu 64 PSMA I&T PET/CT outside the prostate and pelvic lymph nodes (M1 disease), Proportion of patients with M1 lesions on copper Cu 64 PSMA I\&T PET/CT subsequently confirmed to be TP by biopsy, surgery and confirmatory imaging., 4 Hours|Assess the impact of copper Cu 64 PSMA I&T PET/CT on the intended clinical management of study participants, Percentage of patients in whom the copper Cu 64 PSMA I\&T PET/CT changed the intended patient management (major and other changes)., 4 Hours|Assess the detection rate on patient level and split by pelvic lymph nodes and extra pelvic lesions, Patient level positivity rates of copper Cu 64 PSMA I\&T split by pelvic lymph nodes and extra pelvic lesions., 4 Hours|Determine sensitivity and specificity by risk group (unfavorable intermediate, high, or very high risk), Determine the diagnostic performance of copper Cu 64 PSMA I\&T PET/CT for the detection of presence or absence of pelvic lymph node metastasis in pre-prostatectomy patients by risk group (unfavorable intermediate, high, or very high risk)., 4 Hours
The study will include approximately 323 patients with newly diagnosed unfavorable intermediate high-risk, high-risk or veru high-risk prostate cancer electing to undergo radical prostatectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection. Each patient will be administered an 8 mCi (± 10 percent) intravenous dose of copper Cu 64 PSMA I\&T injection. PET/CT imaging will be acquired for all patients at 1-4 hours ± 15 minutes post copper Cu 64 PSMA I\&T injection.

The PET/CT images will be interpreted independently by three readers blinded to all patient information. Each patient study will be assessed and scored for the detection of lesions considered positive for Prostate Cancer (PC) in pelvic lymph nodes. Positive lesions in the prostate, extra pelvic lymph nodes, bones and soft tissue/viscera will also be recorded. Analysis of the reads will be used for determination of sensitivity and specificity of copper Cu 64 PSMA I\&T PET/CT by comparison to the reference standard of histopathology after matching by hemipelvis with at least one true positive lesion defining a true positive patient. Detection of PC outside the pelvis on the copper Cu 64 PSMA I\&T PET/CT will be assessed using reference standard of histopathology and if not available conventional imaging. Baseline conventional imaging will be reviewed for PC disease or no disease by independent radiology readers.
