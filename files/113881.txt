Pancreatic Enzyme Suppletion in Pancreatic Cancer
This study will evaluate the effect of immediate pancreatic enzyme suppletion on the physical and mental health status and survival of patients who are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and are highly likely to develop exocrine pancreatic insufficiency during their disease process.

To evaluate if prescribing pancreatic enzymes in patients with pancreatic cancer leads to a decrease in weight loss., Percentage of change in body weight ((index weight - monthly weight)/ index weight) x100% during the 6 months of follow-up. This will be measured on a monthly basis and measured by area under the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve, every month during 6 months after inclusion
improvement of the nutritional status, Nutritional deficiencies, 1 sample of blood will be drawn (3 times 8ml of blood):

* Glucose, HbA1c (glycol Hb)
* Magnesium, phosphate, ferritin
* Hb
* albumin
* total protein
* calcium
* folic acid
* vitamin A, E, B12
* 1,25-di-OH-Vitamine D
* 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25-OH-vitamin D), every three months|quality-of-life, SF36 questionnaire, on a monthly base during 6 months after inclusion|improvement of the nutritional status, A monthly patient journal which will focus on the presence or absence of steatorrhea-related symptoms, every month during six months after inclusion
Weight loss in cancer is caused by primary tumour effects and secondary effects (e.g. side effects of treatment, mechanical and intestinal obstruction). In pancreatic cancer, additional weight loss and malnutrition may be due to the development of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI). The presence of EPI in pancreatic cancer is frequently overlooked, because the focus of treatment is directed at possible surgery or chemotherapy and its potential side effects. Although studies have proven that pancreatic enzymes may prevent or decrease weight loss, they are seldom being prescribed.
