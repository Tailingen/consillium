Dermatosis Papulosa Nigra
DPN is a disorder among darkly pigmented patients, manifested by small, benign, variants of seborrheic keratoses, predominantly on the face.

The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of a 585 nm PDL for the treatment of Dermatosis Papulosa Nigra, and compare it to therapy with curettage (scraping the lesions off) and electrodesiccation (burning the lesions off).
