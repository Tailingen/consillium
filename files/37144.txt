Fibroscan Predicts Complications After Hepatectomy
Most of the postoperative complications that may occur after hepatectomy are related to the underlying liver background, and the common preoperative tests do not completely predict such complications. Transient elastography by Fibroscan is used to calculate the stiffness and the steatosis of the liver, and it may be also used to predict postoperative complications after hepatectomy
Liver Neoplasms
Accuracy of Fibroscan in predicting complication after hepatectomy, Calculation of the accuracy of the liver stiffness and steatosis measured with the Fibroscan in predicting complications after hepatectomy. The values of the stiffness and steatosis will be correlated with the number of complications, 90 days
A prospective cohort study on consecutive patients scheduled for hepatectomy was planned. Fibroscan was performed during the preoperative workup. Accuracy of the liver stiffness and steatosis measured by Fibroscan in predicting the presence of cirrhosis, of steatosis, and the development of postoperative complications was assessed by ROC curve, and multivariate analysis.
