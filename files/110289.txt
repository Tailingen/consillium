AMH for the Identification of PCOM in PCOS Diagnosis
The purpose of this study is to validate the anti-mÃ¼llerian hormone (AMH) cut-off established and validated in the APHRODITE study, for the determination of PCOM as part of the diagnosis of PCOS, using the Elecsys AMH Plus immunoassay.
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
The validation of the performance of the AMH cut-off, established in the APHRODITE study, to diagnose PCOM in the context of PCOS diagnosis., The performance (sensitivity and specificity) of the AMH cut-off will be calculated by comparing the AMH values to the PCOM status of the subjects based on the TVUS findings (AFC \& Ovarian volume)., Baseline
Prevalence of PCOS in general population, PCOS is diagnosed based on the Rotterdam Criteria with the presence of at least two of the following symptoms: 1. Polycystic ovarian morphology by trans-vaginal ultrasound (\>=20 follicles in either ovary or ovarian volume \>= 10 mL), 2. Hyperandrogenism, either clinical or biochemical (testosterone/free androgen index) and 3. oligo-amenorrhea (\< 8 menstruations/year)., Baseline
The study participants will be women born July 1985-Dec 1987 in Northern Finland; the study partially links to the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986. Female subjects included in this cohort will be invited to participate in the study with the aim to enroll up to 1800 subjects. Each enrolled subject will have one study visit, where the clinical data required for assessing their PCOS status will be recorded, including a gynecological examination by transvaginal ultrasound to determine polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM) status (antral follicle count and ovarian volume). Study subjects will also have blood drawn for serum collection, where hormonal parameters relevant for PCOS will be measured. The collected serum will also be used to measure the AMH levels using the Roche Elecsys AMH test.
