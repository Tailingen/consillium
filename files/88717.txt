Optical Biopsy for Peritoneal Nodules in Colorectal Patients
During surgery, peritoneal metastasis is typically confirmed pathologically through resection sample. However, this process can be time-consuming when utilizing intro-operative frozen section pathology. To address this issue, we propose utilizing confocal laser endomicroscopy to provide in situ, real-time, and in-vivo diagnosis of suspected peritoneal nodules as cancer metastasis during surgery.

Peritoneal metastasis is a common metastatic site in colorectal cancer patients, and those with peritoneal metastasis often have a poor prognosis. During surgery, peritoneal metastasis is confirmed pathologically through resection sample, but frozen section pathology can take up to 30 minutes, which is a significant amount of time.

To address this issue, we suggest utilizing probed-based confocal laser endoscopy (pCLE), a novel endoscopic adjunct that enables real-time in vivo histological examination of mucosal surfaces. By using intravenous fluorescent agents, pCLE highlights certain mucosal elements that facilitate an optical biopsy in real time.

By providing a promising optical biopsy, CLE has the potential to enable in situ, real-time, and in vivo diagnosis of colorectal cancer patients with peritoneal nodules during surgery.
