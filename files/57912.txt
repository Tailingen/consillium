This prospective study evaluates celiac plexus radiosurgery for pain control in patients with upper abdominal malignancies.
Digestive System Neoplasms
RADIATION: Celiac Plexus Radiosurgery
Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) pain score difference from baseline, 3 weeks post treatment
Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) pain score difference from baseline, 6 weeks and 3 months post treatment and subsequently every 3 months on average up to 1 year post treatment|Analgesic use difference from baseline in oral morphin equivalents, Average analgesic consumption will be defined using daily oral morphine equivalents in milligrams, 6 weeks and 3 months post treatment and subsequently every 3 months on average up to 1 year post treatment|QoL difference from baseline, 6 weeks and 3 months post treatment and subsequently every 3 months on average up to 1 year post treatment|Safety profile of the procedure - measuring the frequency and severity of treatment side effects, mainly GI toxicities, The safety profile will focused on fatigue and expected GI (gastro-intestinal) toxicities as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Acute and late toxicity will be assessed using the NCI-CTCAE (common toxicity criteria for adverse events) version 4.0, 6 weeks and 3 months post treatment and subsequently every 3 months on average up to 1 year post treatment
This study aims as primary objective to evaluate short and long term pain relief following the administration of radiosurgery to the celiac plexus in patients with upper abdominal cancer. As secondary objectives it will describe acute and late side effects and quality of life measures of patients undergoing the treatment.

The study has a prospective, single arm design. It will be composed from an initial run-in safety assessment that will include 6 patients and then continue as a phase II trial. All eligible patients will receive the same protocol of celiac plexus radiosurgery and will be evaluated before, during and following this treatment.

The treatment duration is one and a half weeks (5 fractions delivered every other weekday).
