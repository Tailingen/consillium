Observational Retrospective Study of Evaluation of Prognostic Factors in Advanced Pancreatic Cancer Patients Treated With FOLFIRINOX
The aim of this study is to identify new prognostic factors in patients affected by advanced pancreatic carcinoma treated with first line chemotherapy with FOLFIRINOX regimen. Primary objective is the identification of clinical, laboratory and pathologic factors affecting overall survival of these patients.
Pancreatic Cancer Non-resectable
DRUG: FOLFIRINOX
Overall survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from study entry until death from any cause. Patients who are alive at the end of the study will be censored at that point., up to 2 years
Progression-free survival, Progression-free survival is defined as time from study entry until progression of disease (according to RECIST 1.1) or death from any cause. Patients who are alive without having progressed at the end of the study will be censored at their last radiological assessment., up to 2 years|Response rate, Response rate is defined as the fraction of treated patients who achieve a response as defined according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria vers. 1.1., up to 2 years|Toxicity rate, Toxicity Rate is defined as the percentage of patients, relative to the total of enrolled subjects, experiencing treatment-related adverse events as assessed by National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (version 4.0), during chemotherapy., up to 2 years
