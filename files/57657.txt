Prospective, Single-arm, Multicenter Clinical Study on Haploidentical Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in Patients With MRD Positive CD19+ALL Treated With Conditioning Regimens Containing Blinatumomab
A study on the effectiveness and safety of haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with MRD positive CD19+ ALL treated with conditioning regimens containing Blinatumomab
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
DRUG: Blinatumomab
Progress-Free Survival, Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from transplantation to disease progression or death from any cause., At Year 1
Overall Survival, Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from transplantation to death, At Year 1|Cumulative Incidence of Relapse, The time from the date of transplantation to disease recurrence:

Disease recurrence, defined as one of the following:

Leukemia blasts reappeared in peripheral blood, or blasts ≥ 5%, naive monocytes ≥ 5% in bone marrow, or extramedullary lesions., At Year 1|Non-relapse Mortality, NRM was defined as death after transplant that was not preceded by recurrent or progressive malignancy., At Year 1|Minimal Residual Disease, Minimal residual disease is a small number of cancer cells left in the body after treatment., At Year 1|acute graft versus host disease, assessment of acute GVHD, At Day 100|chornic graft versus host disease, assessment of chronic GVHD, At Year 1
This is a prospective multicenter clinical study. This study is applicable to CD19+ ALL patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The purpose is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with MRD positive CD19+ ALL treated with conditioning regimens containing Blinatumomab.31 patients will be included in the study. Clinical endpoints include progress-free survival, Overall survival, cumulative incidence of relapse, non-relapse mortality, minimal residual disease, and graft versus host disease.
