A Phase II Study of Intra-arterial Chemotherapy With Cisplatin and Mitomycin-C in Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This study is for people with cancer of the liver that cannot be completely removed by surgery. This study involves giving the drugs mitomycin-C and cisplatin, into an artery in the liver. Mitomycin-C is a drug that has been approved by the FDA to treat cancer of the stomach and pancreas. Mitomycin-C is a drug that causes cancer cells to die and prevents them from reproducing. Cisplatin is also a drug that has been approved by the FDA. Cisplatin is approved to treat cancer of the testes, ovaries, lung, esophagus, bladder, head and neck. Cisplatin is a drug that prevents cancer cells from reproducing. The purpose of this study is to see how long it takes subjects' tumor(s) to grow after receiving the study drugs. Another purpose of this study is to look at the side effects of this study therapy and how long subjects survive after receiving it.

An additional purpose of this study is to see how well we can predict subjects' response to the study therapy, based on blood and tumor tissue tests. These tests will measure the levels of genes (the cell's blueprint) in subjects' tumors and blood. These genes affect how people's bodies react to the cancer drugs.
