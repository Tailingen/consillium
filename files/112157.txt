Total Neoadjuvant Therapy in Rectal Cancer Treatment
This is a randomized, controlled, parallel study to determine the efficiency and safety of total neoadjuvant therapy in rectal cancer treatment.
Rectal Cancer
COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy|PROCEDURE: TME|DRUG: consolidation chemotherapy|DRUG: adjuvant chemotherapy
The rate of complete responses, The rate of pathological or clinical complete responses, 3-6 months
Rate of R0-resections, Rate of R0-resections, immediately after surgery|Rate of compliance with radiotherapy and chemotherapy, Rate of complications III-VI grade of radiotherapy (RTOG) and chemotherapy (NCI-CTC), 6-8 months|rate of intraoperative and postoperative complications, Frequency and structure of intraoperative and postoperative complications according to the Clavien-Dindo classification, 0-30 days after surgery
In this randomized, controlled, parallel study we will comparison total neoadjuvant therapy with standard neoadjuvant therapy in rectal cancer treatment. Complete pathological response rate will be the primary endpoint in patients, who will undergoing surgery. In cases of complete clinical response we will provide "watch and wait" approach. Compliance of treatment and oncologic results will be the second endpoint.
