Number of Patients With Complete Pathologic Response Rate, Observed Following Treatment With q3week Carboplatin, Weekly Abraxane and Weekly Trastuzumab in Resectable and Unresectable LABC;, These numbers represent patients with a RCB score of zero (0). RCB stands for residual cancer burden., 1 year
Patients Affected by Toxicities of Regimen During Treatment, Including Grade >2 Neurotoxicity the Incidence of Subclinical and Clinical Cardiac Toxicity, Please note that these events represent toxicities that were experienced during treatment, but that does not mean that all toxicities were indeed deemed related to study treatment., 1 year
Our goal is to develop an induction chemotherapy regimen that will have a pCR rate above 50% in HER2+ patients without exposing patients to the toxicity of an anthracycline-based regimen. A minimum of 60 evaluable patients will be accrued to the study. We are assuming an observed pCR (or near pCR) rate of 70%. Assuming no more than 10% of patients will be inevaluable for the primary endpoint (pCR), we will have at least 54 evaluable patients. With this number, we will have 90% power, with a 1-sided alpha error of 0.05, to demonstrate a pCR rate exceeding 50% for our novel regimen.
