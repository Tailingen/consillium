Effect of Product Related Factors on Platelet Concentrate Transfusion Response in Patients With Hematologic Malignacies
Platelet concentrates (PCs) characteristics, such as storage duration, ABO compatibility, dose and source, may have an impact on transfusion responses and outcomes. Because of the relative scarcity of PCs the selection of a specific PC for issue to the patient remains a challenging process. Regulatory agencies do not fully address these characteristics in their recommendations for prophylactic transfusions.

The aim of the study was to analyse the effect of product-related factors in a real life setting, in order to determine which ones are the most relevant when selecting PCs for patients in prophylactic conditions. Two different endpoints are studied: the corrected count increment and the platelet transfusion time intervals.
Lymphoma|Multiple Myeloma|Lymphocytic Leukemia|Hodgkin Disease
OTHER: Platelet concentrate transfusion
Corrected count increment, Platelet increment corrected for platelet dose and body surface area, 24 hours post transfusion
Transfusion interval, Time interval to following platelet transfusion in days, 7 days
