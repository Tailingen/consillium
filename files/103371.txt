Mosunetuzumab and Polatuzumab Vedotin for Untreated Follicular Lymphoma
This phase II clinical trial studies the combination of mosunetuzumab and polatuzumab vedotin in order to see how well it works in patients with untreated follicular lymphoma. Mosunetuzumab is an antibody that has been engineered to attach to two target cells in the immune system: T cells that normally perform tasks like killing virus-infected cells, and cancerous B cells. Mosunetuzumab has been designed to direct these T cells to kill the cancerous B cells instead. Polatuzumab vedotin is an antibody-drug conjugate that attaches to certain cancerous B cells and then delivers a drug specifically to those cells.
