Study of GVAX (With CY) and Pembrolizumab in MMR-p Advanced Colorectal Cancer
This study will be looking at the objective response rate (ORR) as measured by RECIST in in patients with mismatch repair-proficient (MMR-p), advanced colorectal cancer that treated with CY/GVAX in combination with Pembrolizumab.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: CY|BIOLOGICAL: GVAX|DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the number of patients achieving a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) at any time during the study. CR = disappearance of all target lesions, PR is =\>30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, progressive disease (PD) is \>20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, stable disease (SD) is \<30% decrease or \<20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions., up to 1 year
Number of Participants With Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, Number of participants who experience treatment related adverse events â‰¥ grade 3 as defined by CTCAE 4.0., up to 1 year|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression-free Survival (PFS) is defined as the number of days from cycle 1, day 1 of immunotherapy until first documented local progression or death due to any cause. PD is \>20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions as assessed using RECIST (version 1.1)., up to 1 year|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the number of days from start of study treatment to time of death. Individuals will be censored at the date of the last study visit if no event occurs. The estimation method used was Kaplan-Meier., Up to 1 year|Duration of Response (DOR), Number of weeks from the start date of PR or CR (whichever response is recorded first) and subsequently confirmed to the first date that recurrent or progressive disease or death is documented. Per RECIST 1.1, CR = disappearance of all target lesions, PR is =\>30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions., 1 year
