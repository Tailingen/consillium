A Nationwide Phase 2 Trial of Patients With Smoldering and Active Multiple Myeloma (MM)
The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of treating patients with intermediate risk smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) with combinational therapy with dexamethasone and lenalidomide (Rd) and patients with high risk SMM with combinational therapy with Rd and carfilzomib.
Multiple Myeloma|Smoldering Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Carfilzomib|DRUG: Lenalidomide|DRUG: Dexamethasone
Rate of MRD negativity, Minimal residual disease (MRD) as determined VDJ sequencing, 36 months after study enrollment
Progression free survival, Rates of progression free survival with progression being determined by IMWG response criteria, Up until 3 years after treatment|Overall survival, Overall survival as determened by the Icelandic National Cause of Death Registry, Up until 3 years after treatment
This is an open label, single center, phase II study assessing the efficacy of treating patients with intermediate-risk smoldering myeloma (SMM) with combinational therapy with dexamethasone and lenalidomide and treating patients with high risk SMM and active multiple myeloma (MM) with combinational therapy with dexamethasone, lenalidomide and carfilzomib. Patients that are eligible for this study are participants in the IstopMM study (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03327597) that are diagnosed with intermediate or high-risk SMM or active MM.
