Safety of Genexol PM and Carboplatin as First-line Therapy in Ovarian Cancer
To evaluate the safety profile of Genexol PM combination with carboplatin for patients with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer. We hypothesized Genexol PM can be safely administered to newly diagnosed ovarian cancer patients compared to conventional paclitaxel/carboplatin combination therapy. Therefore, we will compare the prospective cohort with a historical comparison with patients administered paclitaxel/carboplatin and paclitaxel/carboplatin/bevacizumab combination therapy.
