A Study of CD147-targeted CAR-T by Hepatic Artery Infusions for Very Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This is a single-center, single-arm, open label and dose escalation clinical study of anti-CD147 CART cells by hepatic artery infusions in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.
Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: CD147-CART
Incidence and type of adverse events induced by CD147-CART hepatic artery infusions, To assess the safety of CD147-CART (anti-CD147 CAR-T cell) hepatic artery infusions (HAI) for very advanced hepatocellular carcinoma which measured by number and type of adverse events., 12 weeks
DLT and MTD of CD147-CART cell hepatic artery infusions, To determine the dose limited toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CD147-CART hepatic artery infusions., 12 weeks|Activity of CD147-CART cell hepatic artery infusions, To evaluate treatment response of CD147-CART hepatic artery infusions for very advanced hepatocellular carcinoma., 2 years|CD147-CART detection in extrahepatic sites, Quantification of CD147-CART cells in blood samples., 2 years
Patients autologous T cells are activated and then engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) specific for CD147(CD147-CART). CAR-T cells are expanded in culture and returned to the patient by hepatic artery infusion at specific cell doses. Four CD147-CART doses patient are planned at 1-week intervals. Tumor biopsies will be obtained at the time of the initial diagnostic angiogram and during the first infusion session. Serum cytokine level and CAR-T cell number will be measured in whole treatment session.
