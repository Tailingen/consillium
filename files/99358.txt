MAGE A10ᶜ⁷⁹⁶T for Advanced NSCLC
This first time in human study is intended for men and women at least 18 years of age who have advanced lung cancer which has grown or returned after being treated. In particular, it is a study for subjects who have a blood test positive for HLA-A\*02:01 and/or HLA-A\*02:06 and a tumor test positive for MAGE A10 protein expression (protein or gene). This trial is a dose escalation trial that will evaluate 3 doses of transduced cells administered after a lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen using a 3+3 dose escalation design .The study will take the subject's T cells, which are a natural type of immune cell in the blood, and send them to a laboratory to be modified. The changed T cells used in this study will be the subject's own T cells that have been genetically changed with the aim of attacking and destroying cancer cells.

When the MAGE A10ᶜ⁷⁹⁶T cells are available, subjects will receive lymphodepleting chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, followed by the T cell infusion. The purpose of this study is to test the safety of genetically changed T cells and find out what effects, if any, they have in subjects with lung cancer. The study will evaluate three different cell dose levels in order to find out the target cell dose. Once the target cell dose is determined, additional subjects will be enrolled to further test the safety and effects at this cell dose.

Subjects will be seen frequently by the Study Physician right after receiving their T cells back and up to first 6 months. After that, subjects will be seen every three months. Subjects will be seen every 6 months by their Study Physician for the first 5 years after the T cell infusion. If the T cells are found in the blood at five years, then the subjects will continue to be seen once a year until the T cells are no longer found in the blood for a maximum of 15 years. If the T cells are no longer found in the blood at 5 years, then the subject will be contacted by the Study Physician for the next 10 years. Subjects who have a confirmed response or clinical benefit ≥4 weeks after the first T-cell infusion and whose tumor continues to express the appropriate antigen target may be eligible for a second infusion. All subjects, completing or withdrawing from the Interventional Phase of the study, will enter a 15-year long-term follow-up phase for observation of delayed adverse events. All subjects will continue to be followed for overall survival during the long-term follow-up phase.
