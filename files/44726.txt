Excision of Lymph Node Trial (EXCILYNT) (Mel69)
The purpose of this study is to find out if removing only the cancerous lymph node (known as a lymph node excision) is effective at preventing cancer from coming back in the same area of the lymph node excision. The study team is also trying to find out the side effects of this type of surgery and how much the surgery impacts quality of life.

In order to be eligible for this study, participants must have been diagnosed with metastatic melanoma and have one detected cancerous lymph node by imaging (CT/PET scan) or clinical examination, and are a candidate for lymph node excision.
Melanoma
PROCEDURE: Excision of clinically detected lymph node metastasis before any systemic therapy|PROCEDURE: Excision of clinically detected lymph node metastasis after neoadjuvant systemic therapy
Node basin-only recurrence, Number of participants with recurrence of melanoma within the node basin without concurrent or preceding distant metastatic recurrence, 3 years after the lymph node excision
Lymphedema, Proportion of patients with lymphedema in the extremity closest to the dissected lymph node basin, within 3 years after the lymph node excision
