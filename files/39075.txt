The Impact of a Colonoscopy Monitoring Program on Endoscopists' Performance
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if colonoscopy monitoring program works to adenoma detection rate in endoscopists. It will also learn about the impact on sessile serrated lesion detection rate, adenomas per colonoscopy, sessile serrated lesions per colonoscopy, advanced adenoma detection rate. The main questions it aims to answer are:

Does colonoscopy monitoring program effect on adenoma detection rate in endoscopists?

Participants will:

Receive result of colonoscopy monitoring program or not every 3 months for 1 year
Adenoma Colon Polyp|Sessile Serrated Adenoma
BEHAVIORAL: Feedback from colonoscopy monitoring program
adenoma detection rate, the percentage of patients with at least one histologically proven adenoma, 1 year
sessile serrated lesion detection rate, the percentage of patients with at least one histologically proven sessile serrated lesion, 1 year|adenomas per colonoscopy, the number of detected adenomas divided by the total number of screening colonoscopies, 1 year|sessile serrated lesions per colonoscopy, the number of detected sessile serrated lesions divided by the total number of screening colonoscopies, 1 year|advanced adenoma detection rate, the percentage of patients with at least one histologically proven advanced adenoma, 1 year
