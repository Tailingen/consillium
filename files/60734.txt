Study of XmAb®819 in Subjects With Advanced Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of XmAb®819 administered intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) in subjects with relapsed or refractory clear cell renal cell carcinoma and to identify the minimum safe and biologically active dose and the recommended dose (RD).
Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: XmAb819
Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (safety and tolerability of XmAb819), Safety and tolerability as assessed by incidence of TEAEs; incidence of clinically significant changes in safety laboratory tests, PE findings, vital signs, and ECGs; incidence and severity of CRS, 28 days|Incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), Safety and tolerability as assessed by incidence of DLTs and all available data which will be used to determine the optimal dose regimen., 28 days
Measurement of Cmax, Peak plasma concentration (Cmax), 56 days|Measurement of AUCtau, Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUCtau), 56 days|Objective Response rate, Objective response rate (RECIST 1.1 assessment of CT/MRI imaging), 42 days|Progression-free survival, Progression-free survival (RECIST 1.1 assessment of CT/MRI imaging), 42 days|Duration of response, Duration of response (RECIST 1.1 assessment of CT/MRI imaging), 42 days
This is a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, multiple-dose study designed in 2 parts: Part A, dose escalation, and Part B, dose expansion. The study is designed to establish the dosing schedule of XmAb819 administered IV and the dosing schedule of XmAb819 administered SC. The study is designed to evaluate safety and tolerability; to assess PK/PD and immunogenicity; and to preliminarily assess antitumor activity of XmAb819 in subjects with ccRCC. All eligible subjects will have relapsed or refractory disease after standard therapy.
