Neoadjuvant Pembrolizumab in Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma
Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (cSCC) is typically associated with a high tumour mutation burden, with the majority caused by Ultraviolet (UV) exposure (Pickering et al., 2014).

The use of this trial using neoadjuvant Pembrolizumab in patients with cSCC who will otherwise undergo highly morbid radical surgical resection has multiple potential advantages, including:

1. Reduction in surgical and radiotherapy morbidity by reducing tumour burden and allowing the appropriate selection of patients to undergo post-operative radiotherapy;
2. Provision of immediate information about pathological response and
3. Access to tissue to provide insight into resistance mechanisms and identification of biomarkers of response.

The Investigators hypothesized that the use of neoadjuvant Pembrolizumab could reduce tumour burden allowing appropriate selection of patients undergoing radical surgical resection and adjuvant radiotherapy.
Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck|Head and Neck Cancer
DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Assess the rate of pathological response to neo-adjuvant Pembrolizumab, To assess the rate of pathological response of neo-adjuvant Pembrolizumab in patients with locally advanced, resectable cSCC. Response will be measured by reviewing tissue samples taken at either surgical resection or biopsy following 4 cycles of neo-adjuvant Pembrolizumab. A pathological complete response will show no viable tumour cells.

Pathological response will be determined as:

Major Pathological response (less than or equal to 10% viable tumour cells remaining following 4 cycles of Neo-adjuvant Pembrolizumab) Pathological Partial Response (11-50% of viable tumour cells remaining following 4 cycles of neo-Adjuvant Pembrolizumab) Pathological Stable and/or Progressive disease (greater than 50% viable tumour cells following 4 cycles of Neo-adjuvant Pembrolizumab), Will be assessed at the end of Cycle 4 (each cycle is 21 days) of Neo-adjuvant Pembrolizumab.
Objective response Rate, To estimate objective response rate (ORR) as per investigator assessed RECIST 1.1 criteria, Will be assessed at the end of Cycle 4 (each cycle is 21 days) of Neo-adjuvant Pembrolizumab|Disease free survival, To estimate investigator assessed disease free survival (DFS) per RECIST 1.1 criteria, From date of drug allocation until the date of first documented recurrence or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 48 months|Overall Survival, To evaluate the overall survival (OS) of the participants., From date of drug allocation until the date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 48 months|Locoregional Recurrence, Freedom from locoregional recurrence, From date of drug allocation until the date of first documented locoregional recurrence or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 48 months|Distant Recurrence, Freedom from Distant Recurrence, From date of drug allocation until the date of first documented distant recurrence or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 48 months|Incidence of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events related to Pembrolizumab, Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events as assessed by CTCAE Version 5, From date of study allocation until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 48 months|Number of Participants with Positive Surgical margins, Positive surgical resection margin defined as tumour cells â‰¤5mm from the surgical margin., At the end of Cycle 4 (cycle length 21 days)
Rate of De-escalation of surgery or post-operative radiotherapy following neo-adjuvant pembrolizumab, Change from planned baseline multidisciplinary meeting recommendation. Patient may de-escalate both Post-operative radiotherapy +/- surgery depending on response, At the end of 4 cycles of neo-adjuvant pembrolizumab. Each cycle is 21 days.|Pattern of failure, Pattern of failure, assessed using descriptive analysis of percentages of patients in which disease recurrence for the primary endpoint of the study is due to local recurrence, regional recurrence, or distant recurrence, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 2 years following last administration of study drug (4 years total)|Cumulative occurrence of Second Primary Tumours (SPT), Cumulative occurrence of SPTs for each patient, From date of drug allocation until the date of first documented recurrence or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 48 months|18F FDG PET/CT complete metabolic response (CMR) rate, absence FDG uptake of target tumour lesion on 18F FDG PET/CT, Assessed at the end of Cycle 4 (each cycle is 21 days)
