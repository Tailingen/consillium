Two Schemes Response in Multiple Myeloma
Retrospective study based on medical records of patients with multiple myeloma, eligible for stem cell transplantation, who received, first-line, the VTD or TD combination.
Response, Acute Phase|Survivorship
DRUG: Bortezomib
Favorable Response, Criteria established with the International Multiple Myeloma Working Group, Post-induction (6 months)|Time to next treatment, Need for a secondline treatment after induction, Post-induction (2 years)
Overall survival, Survivorship passing 3000 days, 3000 days
The most current treatment of multiple myeloma is based on a combination of drugs, including immunomodulators, proteasome inhibitors, etc. The VTD (bortezomib, thalidomide, and dexamethasone) and TD (thalidomide and dexamethasone) regimens are commonly used as a first-line treatment due to limited resources. The study aimed to compare the proportion of favorable responses, survival, and time to the next treatment between two different treatment approaches. The investigators designed a retrospective study based on medical records of patients with multiple myeloma, eligible for stem cell transplantation, who received, first-line, the VTD or TD combination.
