Micro-transplantation in Elderly Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This study aims at evaluating the safety and the tolerance of the micro-transplantation in elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia who are ineligible to conventional allogeneic transplantation.

Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is an aggressive hematological malignancy with a median age at diagnosis of 65 years. Outcomes of AML in elderly population remain unsatisfactory with low rates of complete remission, poor disease-free and overall survival. Therapeutic management of older patients with AML deals with patient-related features (i.e. comorbid conditions and performance status) as well as disease-related prognostic factors (i.e. cytogenetics and molecular genetics). Even if allogeneic hematopoietic-cell transplantation provides the strongest antineoplasic effect, this treatment option remains limited for older patients owing to toxicities, the development of significant graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and logistics of donor availability. More recently, micro-transplantation has emerged as an alternative strategy based on the infusion of mobilized HLA-mismatched related donor cells after induction chemotherapy, thus exerting a graft-versus-leukemia effect without substantial donor engraftment and GVHD. Therefore, there is much of interest in investigating the efficacy and the safety of this method for older patients with AML who are not candidates for allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
