This is a single center, randomized, controlled study. Patients undergo surgical resection with standard Doxorubicin/Cyclophosphamide Followed by Docetaxel (AC-T).

Chemotherapy begins within 4 weeks after surgery for patients randomized to arm I-IV. Arm I: patients who didn't have CIA receive oral toremifene daily. Treatment continues for 5 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Arm II: patients who had CIA receive toremifene as in arm I. Arm III: patients without CIA receive oral toremifene and goserelin for ovarian function suppression. Arm IV: patients with CIA receive oral toremifene and goserelin for ovarian function suppression. Patients are followed every 6 months for 5 years and annually thereafter.
