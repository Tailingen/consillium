A Feasibility Study to Identify T-cell Responses to Neo-epitopes in Tumor Invaded Lymph Nodes (NeoEpitope)
Feasibility study for a method allowing identification of tumor mutated epitopes in patients with breast cancer or cutaneous melanoma, and quantification of CD8+ T cells specific for these tumor neo-antigens in their lymph nodes
Breast Cancer|Cutaneous Melanoma
PROCEDURE: Blood sampling
Feasibility of a method allowing identification of tumor mutated epitopes in patients with breast cancer or cutaneous melanoma and quantification of CD8+ T cells specific for the tumor neo-antigens identified in the lymph nodes., Feasibility study for a method allowing identification of tumor mutated epitopes : Identification of MHC cl I and II restricted tumor neo-epitopes by two different methods i.e. by an elution-HPLC method performed on cell lines derived from tumor cells obtained from invaded lymph node, or using predictive algorithms on tumor sequencing data., up to 24 months
Quantification of CD4+ T lymphocytes specific for identified tumor neo-antigens in the lymph nodes., up to 24 months|Quantification of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes specific for identified neo-antigens in the blood and tumor., up to 24 months|Comparison of the frequency and relative amplitude of the T cell response specific for the tumor neo-epitopes with other immune responses and responses against known tumor antigens., Comparison of the frequency and relative amplitude of the T cell response specific for the tumor neo-epitopes with other immune responses such as anti-viral memory responses (influenza A, ...), chronic viral responses (cytomegalovirus \[CMV\] Epstein-Barr virus \[EBV\], ...) and responses against known tumor antigens (such as NY-ESO-1, MAGE-A3, p53, gp100 ....)., up to 24 months
