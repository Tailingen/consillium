Neoadjuvant Toripalimab in Combination With Carboplatin and Nab-paclitaxel in Untreated Salivary Gland Malignant Neoplasms
This proposed study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of preoperative administration Toripalimab combined with nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin in salivary gland malignant neoplasms who are about to undergo surgery.Monoclonal antibodies, such as Toripalimab , may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.This trial will be helpful for comprehensive exploratory characterization of tumor immune microenvironment and circulating immune cells in these patients.
Salivary Gland Malignant Neoplasms|Salivary Gland Tumors
DRUG: Toripalimab , Carboplatin, Nab-paclitaxel
Adverse events graded by CTCAE v5.0, Percentage of adverse events that are possibly, probably or definitely related to study treatment per Criteria for Adverse Events version 5 (CTCAE v5.0)., 90 days after the first dose of study treatment|Percentage of participants demonstrating pathological response, Pathologic response in the primary tumor was assessed using a quantitative grading scheme:

pathologic tumor response \[nonviable tumor\] PTR0 = no or \<10% PTR1 = ≥10% PTR2 = ≥50%, At time of surgery
Disease-free survival （DFS）, DFS is defined as the time from treatment until the date of the first relapse (local/regional recurrence or distant metastasis) or death (from any cause) whichever comes firsts and regardless of whether the patient withdraws from treatment or receives another anti-cancer therapy prior to disease relapse., 2 years|Overall survival（OS）, Overall survival will be defined as the time from day 1 of study treatment until death from any cause., 5 years|Radiographic Response, Radiographic response to treatment as defined by RECIST 1.1., 5 weeks|Pathologic Response, Pathologic response to neoadjuvant treatment in resected tumor and lymph nodes. The rate of major pathologic response, defined as \<10% residual viable tumor cells in the resection specimen will be compared to historic data with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 6 weeks|Rate of surgery delay, Rate of patients with an Unplanned Delay to Surgery defined as any change to scheduled surgery date considered to be at least possibly related to neoadjuvant treatment., 8 weeks after the patient receives their last dose
