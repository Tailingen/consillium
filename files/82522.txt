Evaluating the Feasibility of a Digital Health Coaching Program for Individuals Following CAR T Therapy
The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of a digital health coaching program for, and to describe quality of life of, individuals in the 6 months following chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy. Up to 50 English-speaking individuals aged 18 and older who are to receive treatment with a CAR T cell therapy will be enrolled, all at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Participants must have internet access via smart phone, tablet, a computer, or another device with the capacity to receive calls, texts, or e-mails, as well as the electronic study assessments and will be excluded if they are unable to provide informed consent or have a prognosis of 6 months or less.

Consented participants will be enrolled in a 6-month digital health coaching program delivered via weekly calls from a Health Advisor coupled with the digital delivery of content. The program focuses on identification and escalation of treatment-related toxicity, communication with providers, and physical and psychosocial health following treatment. Health related quality of life (HRQoL) will be assessed with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lymphoma (FACT-L), health self-efficacy will be assessed by the Cancer Behavior Inventory-Brief (CBI-B), physical and mental health outcomes will be measured by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Global Health 10. Patient experience in managing CAR T specific care will be assessed with a 5-item questionnaire developed specifically for use in this study, focused on participants' confidence in understanding, identifying and managing symptoms, and communicating with providers. Study outcomes will contribute to knowledge about if and how a digital health intervention may be used to support individuals post-CAR T cell therapy.
