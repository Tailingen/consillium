Study of Quality of Life Post Salpingo-oophorectomy in BRCA1/2 & PALB2 Mutation Carriers (BRCA-HRT)
1. Premenopausal BRCA1 / 2 or PALB2 gene mutation carriers who receive hormone replacement therapy (HRT) after preventive salpingo-oophorectomy (PBSO) have a better quality of sexual, psychological, cardiovascular and bone health than carriers who decline HRT.
2. Premenopausal mutation carriers treated with PBSO who choose HRT have a comparable overall survival and specific survival for breast / gynecological cancer to women who undergo surgery and refuse to receive HRT.
3. Premenopausal mutation carriers treated with PBSO have better overall and specific breast / gynecological cancer survival than non-SOBP carriers.
Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer
To compare the scale MenCav of quality of life in premenopausal carriers opting and rejecting hormone replacement therapy post salpingo-oophorectomy, Questionnaire to measure quality of life in post-menopausal women (the Mencav questionnaire). This questionnaire consists of questions with 5 possible answers, answer 1 is the worst result and question 5 is the best result, so low scores mean worse results and high scores better results., 5 years
To compare the impact of hormone replacement therapy on number and description of cardiovascular events, To describe cardiovascular risk we used changes in the weight of patients. Weight in kilograms, height in meters and weight and height will be combined to report BMI in kg/m\^2., 5 years|To compare the impact of hormone replacement therapy on number and description of cardiovascular events, To describe cardiovascular risk we used changes in blood pressure (mmHg), 5 years|To compare the impact of hormone replacement therapy on number and description of cardiovascular events, To describe cardiovascular risk we used changes in lipids levels (cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL, LDL and VLDL), 5 years|To compare the impact of hormone replacement therapy on number and description of cardiovascular events, To describe cardiovascular risk we used eventual cardiovascular adverse events, 5 years|To compare the impact of hormone replacement therapy on number and description of bone loss related events in premenopausal carriers after salpingo-oophorectomy we will perform bone densitometry, By performing bone densitometry we will be able to quantify the number of participants with adverse events related to bone loss (osteoporosis or osteopenia), 5 years|Comparison of overall cancer survival between women deciding risk-reducing surgery and those rejecting it., We will analyze and compare the mean of overall survival of women undergoing for risk-reducing surgery and those rejecting it, 5 years|Comparison of mean of breast cancer specific survival between women deciding gynecological surgery and those rejecting surgery., We will analyze and compare the mean of breast cancer specific survival in women undergoing surgery and those rejecting it., 5 years|Comparison of gynecologic cancer survival between women deciding preventive surgery and those rejecting it., We will analyze and compare the mean of gynecologic cancer survival of women undergoing surgery and those rejecting it., 5 years
