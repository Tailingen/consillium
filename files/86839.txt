Treatment Patterns and Clinical Outcomes Among Patients With HR+/HER2- mBC Receiving Palbociclib Combination Therapy in the US Community Oncology Setting.
By leveraging a community-based, cancer-specific electronic healthcare record for this study, we aim to understand treatment patterns and clinical outcomes among patients with HR+/HER2- mBC who received care within the context of a large community oncology network in the United States.
Breast Cancer
Time to Chemotherapy, Time to chemotherapy was defined as the interval (in weeks) between index treatment (palbociclib +fulvestrant) and start of chemotherapy as documented in the iKnowMed (iKM) EHR database. Participants with ongoing treatment at the study observation period were censored on the study end date or the last visit date available in the dataset, whichever occurred first.

Participants with ongoing treatment at the study observation period were censored on the study end date or the last visit date available in the dataset, whichever occurred first. Kaplan-Meier method was used for analysis., From start of index treatment until stop of index treatment or censoring date, during study observation period maximum up to approximately 53 months (data was retrieved and observed during 2.5 years of this retrospective study)|Time to Next Treatment (TTNT) From Index Treatment, Time to next treatment (TTNT) was defined as the interval between the start of the index treatment and the date of the next-line treatment as documented in the iKM EHR database. Participants who did not advance to the next treatment within the study observation period were censored on the study end date or the last visit date available in the dataset, whichever occurred first. Kaplan-Meier method was used for analysis., From start of index treatment to date of next line treatment or censoring date, during study observation period maximum up to approximately 53 months (data was retrieved and observed during 2.5 years of this retrospective study)|Percentage of Participants With Provider Documented Disease Progression, Percentage of participants with provider documented progression (documented as disease has progressed or worsening of disease) is reported in this outcome measure., From start of treatment until documented disease progression, during study observation period maximum up to approximately 53 months (data was retrieved and observed during 2.5 years of this retrospective study)|Real-World Time to Tumor Progression (rwTTP), The rwTTP was measured from the initiation of index treatment to the date of provider-documented progression (documented by provider as disease has progressed or worsening of disease), censoring participants without evidence of provider-documented progression at the last visit date. Kaplan-Meier method was used for analysis., From initiation of the index treatment to the date of progression or censoring date, during study observation period maximum up to approximately 53 months (data was retrieved and observed during 2.5 years of this retrospective study)|Real-World Progression-Free Survival (rwPFS), The rwPFS was measured from the initiation of the index treatment to the date of progression (documented by provider as disease has progressed or worsening of disease) or date of death due to any cause, censoring participants who were still alive at the end of the study observation period and did not progress at the last visit date. Kaplan-Meier method was used for analysis., From initiation of index treatment to date of progression or death due to any cause or censoring date, during study observation period maximum up to approximately 53 months (data was retrieved and observed during 2.5 years of this retrospective study)|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) was defined as the interval between index treatment and the date of death (any cause) as documented in the Limited Access Death Master File (LADMF), National Death Index (NDI) and the iKM EHR database. Participants who did not die within the study observation period were censored on the study end date or the last visit date available in the dataset, whichever occurred first. Kaplan-Meier method was used for analysis., From start of index treatment until date of death or censoring date, during study observation period maximum up to approximately 53 months (data was retrieved and observed during 2.5 years of this retrospective study)
Percentage of Participants According to the Dosing Strength of Fulvestrant and Palbociclib as Their Index Treatment, The percentage of participants classified according to the dosing strength of Palbociclib and Fulvestrant as their index treatment were reported in this outcome measure. Index date was the date of initiation with palbociclib + fulvestrant during the study identification period., At index, anytime between 01-February-2016 and 31-December-2019 (data was retrieved and observed during 2.5 years of this retrospective study)|Duration of Treatment for Advanced Metastatic Breast Cancer, The duration of treatment for advanced metastatic breast cancer was reported in this outcome measure., From start of index treatment until stop of index treatment, during study observation period maximum up to approximately 53 months (data was retrieved and observed during 2.5 years of this retrospective study)|Percentage of Participants With Prior Adjuvant Hormonal Treatment for Advanced Metastatic Breast Cancer, Percentage of participants with prior adjuvant hormonal treatment for breast cancer were reported in this outcome measure. Index date was the date of initiation with palbociclib + fulvestrant during the study identification period., Prior to index date (the date of initiation with Palbociclib-Fulvestrant during the study identification period) (data was retrieved and observed during 2.5 years of this retrospective study)|Number of Participants According to Year of Treatment Initiation for Advanced Metastatic Breast Cancer, Number of participants were classified according to the year of treatment initiation for advanced metastatic breast cancer in this outcome measure., Quarter(Q)1 2015,Q2 2015,Q3 2015,Q4 2015,Q1 2016,Q2 2016,Q3 2016,Q4 2016,Q1 2017,Q2 2017,Q3 2017,Q4 2017,Q1 2018,Q2 2018,Q3 2018,Q4 2018,Q1 2019,Q2 2019,Q3 2019,Q4 2019(data was retrieved and observed during 2.5 years of this retrospective study)|Percentage of Participants With Change in Dose, The percentage of participants with dose change for index treatment were reported in this outcome measure., From index treatment until follow up period of 6 months (data was retrieved and observed during 2.5 years of this retrospective study)
