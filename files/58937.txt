Palliative Treatments for Patients With Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)
The standard treatment choice for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is sorafenib, and its efficacy is limited. More active treatments were performed in patients with advanced HCC in China, which include radical hepatectomy or TACE. The study is to investigate whether the active treatment will profit survival of patients, and to evaluate the safety.
Hepatectomy|Hepatocellular Carcinoma|Sorafenib
PROCEDURE: hepatic resection|PROCEDURE: transcatheter hepatic arterial chemoembolization|DRUG: sorafenib
Overall survival (OS), defined as the time from the first treatment to death, anticipate 6-12 months
Progression Free Survival (PFS), defined as the time from the first treatment to the first progression disease is confirmed by radiological methods, anticipate 3-6 months|AEs and SAEs, according to CTC AE 3.0, anticipate 6-12 months|cost of treatments, to compare costs of different treatments, 3 months in average
This is a prospective non-randomized controlled study. Patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (BCLC C stage) who underwent palliative resection or TACE followed with Sorafenib or treated by sorafenib alone will be included. The patients will be divided to group A (palliative resection plus sorafenib), group B (palliative TACE plus sorafenib), and group C (sorafenib alone). The sample size will be about 200 cases altogether.
