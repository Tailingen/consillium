This open-label, multicenter study explored primary and secondary prophylaxis treatment with a single, fixed-dose, subcutaneous (SC) injection of pegfilgrastim in elderly subjects with high-risk breast cancer receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy. The primary objective was to provide preliminary information on the incidence of protocol defined neutropenic events in chemotherapy cycle 1.
