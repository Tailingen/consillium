Musculoskeletal Health in Adult Haematological Cancer Survivors
Haematological cancer treatment often includes use of high dose glucocorticoids (steroids), chemotherapy and radiotherapy and current evidence suggests that these patients may have lower bone mineral density after treatment when compared to the general population which can predispose them to increased risk of fragility fractures. Evidence of the impact of these musculoskeletal burden to patients (e.g. quality of life) are not available.

This study aims to describe musculoskeletal complications experienced by long-term haematological cancer survivors and examine the impact of the burden from the patient perspective. The study will be conducted in 2 parts; a questionnaire study and an interview study to help understand the extent of musculoskeletal problems experienced by this group of patients and the impact of this on quality of life.

OTHER: Not an intervention study
Questionniare study: To measure prevalence of musculoskeletal conditions and related symptoms experienced by adult lymphoma and leukaemia survivors, Musculoskeletal conditions and related symptoms will be recorded by patients on the study specific questionnaire and the validated questionnaire Nordic musculoskeletal questionnaire (NMQ-E) and gait, arms, legs and spine (GALS) assessment, overall length of the study - 6 months|Questionniare study: To calculate the 10-year probability of hip fracture and major osteoporotic fracture (clinical spine, forearm, hip or shoulder fracture) of adult lymphoma and leukaemia survivors, The 10-year probability of hip fracture and major osteoporotic fracture (clinical spine, forearm, hip or shoulder fracture) of adult lymphoma and leukaemia survivors will be calculated using the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) and Q-Fracture calculator., overall length of the study - 6 months|Questionniare study: To measure prevalence of sarcopenia and frailty among adult lymphoma and leukaemia survivors, Validated questionniares will be used to assess if patients have sarcopenia (SARC-F questionnaire) and frailty (FiND questionnaire)., overall length of the study - 6 months|Questionniare study: To assess quality of life and musculoskeletal function related quality of life of adult lymphoma and leukaemia survivors, This will be assessed using validated questionnaires - Short Form Survey (SF36) and Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment (SMFA)., overall length of the study - 6 months|Interivew study: To describe experience of adult lymphoma and leukaemia survivors on musculoskeletal health, musculoskeletal related care and musculoskeletal health information provision., Semi-structured qualitative interviews will be conducted with a topic guide to ensure same broad topics are explored in the interviews on musculoskeletal health experience, care and information provision., overall length of the study - 6 months
Questionnaire study: To describe the likely risk factors that may be associated with musculoskeletal consequences of adult lymphoma and leukaemia survivors Impact of musculoskeletal health, This will be assessed using regression analysis to determine risk factors that may be associated with poor musculoskeletal health, overall length of the study - 6 months
