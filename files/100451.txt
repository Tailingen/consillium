Ledderhose Disease: Radiotherapy or Not?
The aim of the LedRad trial is to determine the efficacy and durability of radiotherapy as treatment for patients with Ledderhose disease and to compare this to the natural course of Ledderhose disease.
Ledderhose Disease
RADIATION: Radiotherapy|OTHER: Sham Radiotherapy
Numeric Rating Scale, Determine pain with the Numeric Rating Scale, 12 months
Numeric Rating Scale, Determine pain with the Numeric Rating Scale, 6 and 18 months|Size of ledderhose nodules, Determine the effect of radiotherapy on size of Ledderhose nodules with MRI and Ultrasound, 12 months|Walking distance, Determine the effect of radiotherapy on walking distance with the 10 meter straight line walk test, 6, 12 and 18 months|Walking motion, Determine the effect of radiotherapy on walking motion with the PEDAR-XÂ® in shoe pressure measurement system, 12 months|Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, Assess the safety and toxicity of radiotherapy on this population by recording the toxicity of radiotherapy during the course of radiotherapy and thereafter measured by CT-CAE 4.0., 18 months|Quality of life (1), Assess the impact on quality of life of radiotherapy as treatment for this study population with RAND-36 item Health Survey questionnaire, 6, 12 and 18 months|Quality of life (2), Assess the impact on quality of life of radiotherapy as treatment for this study population with the brief pain inventory questionnaire, 6, 12 and 18 months|Quality of life (3), Assess the impact on quality of life of radiotherapy as treatment for this study population with the EURO-Qol-5D questionnaire, 6, 12 and 18 months|Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA), The economic evaluation will be performed from a societal perspective, incorporating cost of travel to the hospital and cost of absence from work as well as direct medical cost of radiotherapy (cost of irradiation and outpatient visits). Questionnaires will be used to collect data regarding health care consumption, travel and time costs, and productivity loss at study entry and at 6-month intervals thereafter. In addition to the pain scores, quality of life will be assessed at 6-month intervals using the Rand-36 questionnaire. The utilities based on the results of the questionnaire will be used in a cost-utility analysis, calculating the ratio of incremental costs versus incremental quality-adjusted life-years (QALY)., 6, 12 and 18 months
