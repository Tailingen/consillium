Feasibility of Prophylactic Haldol to Prevent Delirium in Cancer Patients
This research study proposes to conduct an open label, feasibility study administering prophylactic oral haldol to patients undergoing a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).

The study will address the following research aims: 1) To demonstrate the feasibility of enrolling HSCT patients in a prophylactic medication trial, 2) To determine the tolerability of oral haldol in HSCT patients and 2) To compare rates of delirium in HSCT patients who receive prophylactic haldol with an untreated historical control group.
Stem Cell Transplant Complications|Delirium
DRUG: Haldol
Side Effects and Tolerability of Haldol in Patients With Undergoing Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant, Categorize and quantify adverse events from start of drug (day 1) to end of study drug per (CTCAE) version 4.0, Daily, up to 14 days following transplant
This is an open label, safety \& feasibility, clinical drug trial. We will use historical controls from previous research with bone marrow transplant patients and delirium incidence at University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics (UIHC) to evaluate the efficacy of prophylactic Haldol in the prevention of delirium. This study will recruit adult cancer patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) at UIHC.
