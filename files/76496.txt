A Study of TQ05105 Tablets in Subjects With Myeloproliferative Neoplasms
TQ05105 is a JAK2 inhibitors and can be used to treat JAK2 target-related diseases. The activation of the JAK/STAT pathway is related to abnormal proliferation, obstruction of apoptosis, and differentiation disorder of leukemia cells which is caused by genetic abnormalities and viral infection.
