Postoperative Adjuvant Therapy for Non-clear Renal Cell Carcinoma With High-risk Recurrence Factors
The goal of this prospective, multicenter, single-arm clinical study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of toripalimab in combination with axitinib for postoperative adjuvant therapy for non-clear renal cell carcinoma with high-risk recurrence factors.
Non-clear Renal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Toripalimab|DRUG: Axitinib
DFS, DFS is defined as time interval from the date of randomization to first date of recurrence/relapse (distant or local recurrence of \[RCC\] or occurrence of a secondary malignancy {occurrence of a second primary cancer other than RCC} or death). For participants with no DFS event, DFS was censored at date of last scan prior to time of analyses. Participants alive who did not have post-baseline disease assessments, DFS was censored at randomization. Participants who received further anti-tumor therapy prior to recurrence or occurrence of a secondary malignancy or death, DFS was censored on date of last scan prior to taking anti-tumor medication. Participants who missed 2 or more consecutive tumor scans immediately followed by an event were censored at date of last objective tumor assessment prior to missing/not readable scan., 2 years
OS, OS defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause. In the absence of confirmation of death, survival time was censored at the last date the participant was known to be alive. Participants lacking data beyond randomization had their survival times censored at randomization., 3 years|DRSS, Localised disease recurrence-specific survival, 3 years|Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, Incidence and grade of AEs and SAEs per National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 5.0, incidence of â‰¥ grade 3 AE, 3 years
