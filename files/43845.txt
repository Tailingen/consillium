Glioblastoma Treatment With Irradiation and Olaptesed Pegol (NOX-A12) in MGMT Unmethylated Patients
The purpose of this study is to obtain first, exploratory information on the safety and efficacy of (i) olaptesed pegol in combination with radiation therapy in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma of unmethylated MGMT promoter status either not amenable to resection (biopsy only) or after incomplete tumor resection, and (ii) olaptesed pegol in combination with radiation therapy and bevacizumab in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma of unmethylated MGMT promoter status either not amenable to resection (biopsy only) or after incomplete or complete tumor resection.

Further arms are included (i) to establish safety for the combination of olaptesed pegol at three different doses in addition to radiotherapy and bevacizumab, (ii) to explore the benefit of combining olaptesed pegol at different dose levels with bevacizumab in order to define the doses to move forward into a subsequent randomized dose-finding study, (iii) to explore the contribution of the therapy components olaptesed pegol and bevacizumab to patient benefit and (iv) to put the clinical outcome of these treatment regimens into perspective with the standard of care treatment with temozolomide and radiotherapy.

Safety - Number of patients with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE, Number of patients with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE, through study completion, an average of 3 years
Efficacy - progression free survival at 6 months (PFS-6), Progression free survival at 6 months (PFS-6) in %, 6 months|Efficacy - Median progression-free survival (mPFS), Median progression-free survival (mPFS) in months, until end of treatment, an average 1 year|Efficacy - Median overall survival (mOS), Median overall survival (mOS) in months, through study completion, an average of 3 years|Efficacy - Landmark overall survival at 18 months (OS18), 18 months|Overall response rate (ORR), through study completion, an average of 3 years|Plasma level of olaptesed pegol, concentration of olaptesed pegol in plasma in Âµmol/L, 9 weeks after treatment start|Quality of Life (QoL) EORTC QLQ-C30 Module, Quality of Life measures are recorded according to EORTC QLQ30 module, which is validated for cancer patients in general and measured as a unit of scale. This is a standard tool for assessing patient reported quality of Life along time during treatment., through study completion, an average of 3 years|Quality of Life (QoL) EORTC QLQ BN-20 Module, Quality of Life measures are recorded according to EORTC QLQ BN-20 module, which is validated for brain tumor patients and measured as a unit of scale. This is a standard tool for assessing patient reported quality of Life along time during treatment., through study completion, an average of 3 years|Efficacy - Tumor vascularization as per vascular MRI, Changes from baseline in tumor vascularization over time as %cerebral blood volume, through study completion, an average of 3 years|Neurologic functions as measured by the NANO scale, Change from baseline in neurologic performance scores by Neurologic Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (NANO) scale as an objective and quantifiable metric of neurologic function evaluable during a routine office examination. The NANO Scale evaluates 9 major domains of neurologic function, with each domain being scored on a range from 0 to 2 or 3., 24 months
