Selective Inhibitor of Nuclear Export (SINE) Selinexor (KPT-330) in Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndromes
The purpose of this study is to see if selinexor will improve the blood counts and bone marrow function in people with your type of MDS.
Myelodysplastic Syndromes
DRUG: selinexor (KPT-330)
Best Overall Response Rate, Using a Simon's two-stage minimax design, this trial will accrue a maximum of 20 patients. Early termination may occur if no responses are observed in the first 13 patients. If at least one response is observed, the trial will continue to the maximum sample size. At the end of the trial, the treatment strategy will be considered promising in this patient population if at least 3 patients achieve a response. The type I and type II errors are set at 0.10., 2 years
Response Duration, Response duration will be calculated among patients who achieve a response of HI, mCR, PR or CR using Kaplan-Meier methodology. Median duration of response and the corresponding 95% confidence interval will be estimated., 2 years|Overall Survival, Overall survival from the time of study enrollment will be calculated using Kaplan-Meier methodology. Overall survival curves will be displayed for the study population along with selected quantiles and corresponding 95% confidence intervals of survival., 2 years|Participants Evaluated for Adverse Events, The safety and tolerability of Selinexor and ST will be evaluated by means of drug related AE reports, physical examinations, and laboratory safety evaluations. Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) V4.03 will be used for grading of AEs., 2 years
