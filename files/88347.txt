ClAmpless, Sutureless PartIAl Nephrectomy for Renal Masses
During partial nephrectomy surgery, efforts at minimizing ischemia while maximizing renal parenchymal volume are desirable to preserve renal function1,2. Not only clamping of the hilum but the renorrhaphy portion of the procedure also can have a significant negative impact on renal function3-5. It is possible to perform this procedure without clamping the hilum and also without formal renorrhaphy. However robust prospective formal evaluation of safety, risks, and potential benefits and whether or not the technique can be employed in a generalized fashion has not been studied.

Demonstration of safety and generalizability may open a whole new avenue of approaching nephron sparing and renal function sparing kidney surgery and decrease potential risks for long term kidney disease in patients with renal masses. This study will investigate the safety, efficacy, and generalizability of the use of clampless, sutureless partial nephrectomy in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma.
Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)
PROCEDURE: sutureless, clampless partial nephrectomy
Positive margin rate, Determine the positive margin rate, as measured on the pathology report 2-3 weeks post-surgery., 2-3 weeks post-surgery|Transfusion rate, Determine the transfusion rate, as measured approximately 4 weeks post-surgery via review of patient medical records., 4 weeks post-surgery
Renal dysfunction (1 day post-surgery), Determine subject renal dysfunction, measured using estimated glomerular filtration rate using Cockcroft-gault formula, at 1-day post-surgery., 1 day post-surgery|Renal dysfunction (2-3 weeks post-surgery), Determine subject renal dysfunction, measured using estimated glomerular filtration rate using Cockcroft-gault formula, at 2-3 weeks post-surgery., 2-3 weeks post-surgery|Renal dysfunction (6 months post-surgery), Determine subject renal dysfunction, measured using estimated glomerular filtration rate using Cockcroft-gault formula, at 6 months post-surgery., 6 months post-surgery|Estimated blood loss, Determine the estimated blood loss, as determined on the operative report., at time of partial nephrectomy|Need for ischemia, Determine how many subjects have a need for ischemia, as determined by need to clamp or not., at time of partial nephrectomy
