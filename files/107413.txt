Aumolertinib Adjuvant Therapy of Resectable Stage I EGFRm+ NSCLC With High-grade Patterns
Efficacy and safety of postoperative adjuvant treatment of NSCLC patients with Aumolertinib.
Lung Cancer
DRUG: Aumolertinib
2-year Disease free survival (DFS) rate, Defined as the proportion of patients alive and disease free at 2 years,estimated from Kaplan Meier plots of the primary endpoint of DFS at the time of the primary analysis, From date of treatment start until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months
3-, 4-, and 5-year DFS rate, Defined as the proportion of patients alive and disease free at 3, 4 and 5 years, respectively, estimated from Kaplan Meier plots of the primary endpoint of DFS at the time of the primary analysis., From date of treatment start until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months|Overall Survival (OS), Defined as the time from the date of treatment start until date of death due to any cause, Start of study drug to Survival Endpoint through study completion, an average of 5 years, assessed up to 60 months|Patient health-related quality of life and symptoms (HRQoL) by SF-36v2 Health Survey, Defined as a patient-reported survey of patient health. The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section and the scores range from 0-100. A score of 0 is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability., From date of treatment start until treatment completion or discontinuation, assessed up to 60 months
Incidence of Adverse Events (AEs), AEs graded by CTCAE version 4.0, From date of treatment start until 28 days after treatment completion
This is a multi-center, two-arm clinical study. In patients with stage I non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR 19del/21L858R with solid, micropapillary, and/or complex gland components â‰¥10% who have not received any systemic treatment, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of postoperative adjuvant Aumolertinib in NSCLC patients .
