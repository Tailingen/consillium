Study of AMD3100 (Plerixafor) and Rituximab in Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia or Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma
The purpose of this research study is to determine if plerixafor can make CLL/SLL (Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/ Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma) cells more sensitive to being killed by rituximab, an anti-cancer drug that is commonly used in treating CLL and SLL. In this study, plerixafor will be added to standard treatment with rituximab. Subjects will be monitored to see how well they tolerate the use of these drugs together and how well they work to treat the leukemia.

The primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of plerixafor when combined with rituximab as treatment for previously treated patients with CLL or SLL.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)|Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL)
DRUG: plerixafor
The maximum tolerated dose of plerixafor when combined with rituximab as treatment for previously treated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), 29 Days
The principal toxicities and dose limiting toxicities of plerixafor when combined with rituximab, 73 days|Time to maximal plasma concentration (Tmax) when plerixafor is combined with rituximab, Course 1 (4 weeks)|Area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to the last observed concentration (AUC 0-last) when plerixafor is combined with rituximab, Course 1 (4 weeks)]|Area under the concentration-time curve over the dosing interval (τ) (AUC 0-τ) when plerixafor is combined with rituximab, Course 1 (4 weeks)|Area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC 0-∞ ) when plerixafor is combined with rituximab, Course 1 (4 weeks)|Half-life (T½) when plerixafor is combined with rituximab, Course 1 (4 weeks)|Volume of distribution (Vz/F for subcutaneous (SC) administration; Vz for intravenous (IV) administration);, in the case of multiexponential disposition, volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss) will be calculated when plerixafor is combined with rituximab, Course 1 (4 weeks)
