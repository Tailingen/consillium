Phase 2 Study of Intralesional PV-10 for Metastatic Melanoma
The primary objective of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of intralesional (IL) PV-10 for locoregional treatment of metastatic melanoma. This study will also include assessment of response in untreated bystander lesions following intralesional injection of PV-10 into targeted lesions. Additional objectives are to determine the safety profile of PV-10 following intralesional injection, and assess the pharmacokinetic profile of PV-10 in the bloodstream following intralesional injection.
Melanoma
DRUG: PV-10 (10% rose bengal disodium)
Objective Response Rate (ORR) of PV-10 Treated Lesions, Using modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for cutaneous or subcutaneous target lesions assessed by ruler, caliper or ultrasound: Complete Response (CR), disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Objective Response Rate (ORR) = %CR + %PR., 52 weeks
Objective Response Rate of Untreated Bystander Lesions, Using modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for designated, untreated cutaneous or subcutaneous bystander lesions assessed by ruler, caliper or ultrasound: Complete Response (CR), disappearance of all bystander lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of bystander lesions; Objective Response Rate (ORR) = %CR + %PR., 52 weeks|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression is defined using modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or significant worsening of non-target disease (e.g., a measurable increase in non-target lesions or the appearance of new lesions) indicative of disease progression., 52 weeks|Overall Survival, 1-year survival, 52 weeks
This is a multicenter, open-label, single-agent study. Subjects with at least one melanoma lesion â‰¥ 0.2 cm in diameter that can be accurately measured by ruler/caliper or ultrasound will receive intralesional injection of PV-10 into each of up to twenty (20) Study Lesions. Additionally, one to two measurable Bystander Lesions may remain untreated and will be followed for assessment of bystander response.

To accurately reflect anticipated clinical use, repeat dosing of treated lesions will be allowed at the Investigator's discretion at weeks 8, 12 and 16 following initial treatment for those lesions not exhibiting complete response. Subjects will be followed for 52 weeks following initial treatment with PV-10.
