Incidence, severity and type of TEAEs (Treatment-emergent Adverse Events), An adverse event is any untoward medical event that occurs in a participant administered an investigational product, and it does not necessarily indicate only events with clear causal relationship with the relevant investigational product., Through study completion , an average of 2 years after LUCAR-G39D infusion (Day 1)|Pharmacokinetics in peripheral blood, CAR positive T cells and CAR transgene levels in peripheral blood after LUCAR-G39D infusion., Through study completion , an average of 2 years after LUCAR-G39D infusion (Day 1).|Pharmacokinetics in bone marrow, CAR positive T cells and CAR transgene levels in bone marrow after LUCAR-G39D infusion., Through study completion , an average of 2 years after LUCAR-G39D infusion (Day 1)|The recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) for this cell therapy, RP2D established through ATD+BOIN design and the DLTs occurring following CAR T-cell infusion., Within 30 days after LUCAR-G39D infusion
Overall Response Rate (ORR), Objective Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve CR or PR after treatment via LUCAR-G39D cell infusion, Through study completion, an average of 2 years after LUCAR-G39D infusion (Day 1)|Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the date of first infusion of the LUCAR-G39D to the first documented disease progression (according to Lugano 2014) or death (due to any cause), whichever occurs first, Through study completion, an average of 2 years after LUCAR-G39D infusion (Day 1)|Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from the date of first infusion of LUCAR-G39D to death of the subject, Through study completion, an average of 2 years after LUCAR-G39D infusion (Day 1)|Time to Response (TTR), Time to Response (TTR) is defined as the time from the date of first infusion of LUCAR-G39D to the date of the first response evaluation of the subject who has met all criteria for CR or PR., Through study completion, an average of 2 years after LUCAR-G39D infusion (Day 1)|Duration of Response (DoR), Duration of Remission (DoR) is defined as the time from the first documentation of remission (CR or PR) to the first documented relapse evidence of the responders., Through study completion, an average of 2 years after LUCAR-G39D infusion (Day 1)|Immunogenicity assessment of LUCAR-G39D cells, The incidence of Anti- LUCAR-G39D antibody in patients who received LUCAR-G39D cells infusion, Through study completion, an average of 2 years after LUCAR-G39D infusion (Day 1)
This is an open-label, dose-escalation/dose extension study to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of LUCAR-G39D in the patient â‰¥ 18 years of age with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will receive a single dose of LUCAR-G39D injection. The study will include the following sequential phases: screening, pre-treatment (lymphodepleting chemotherapy), treatment, and follow-up.
