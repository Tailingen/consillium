CEA Targeting Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Lymphocytes (CAR-T) in the Treatment of CEA Positive Advanced Solid Tumors
This study is a single-arm, open-label, dose-escalating + dose-expansion clinical study, aiming to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CEA-targeted CAR-T cell preparations, and to preliminarily observe the study drug in CEA-positive advanced malignant tumors. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of CAR-T cell preparations for the treatment of patients with CEA-positive advanced malignancies were obtained and the recommended dose and infusion schedule.

To evaluate the safety of CAR-T cell preparations in the treatment of CEA-positive advanced malignancies [Safety and Tolerability], The incidence of adverse events after CEA CAR-T cell infusion was assessed by the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, version 5.0), 1 month|Obtained the recommended dose and infusion regimen of CAR-T cells for the treatment of patients with CEA-positive advanced malignancies[Safety and Tolerability], Dose-limiting toxicity after CEA CAR-T cell infusion, 28 days
Assessing disease control rates of CAR-T cell preparations in CEA-positive advanced malignancies[Effectiveness], Disease control rate: The proportion of subjects who achieved CR, PR, SD after CAR-T infusion accounted for all treated subjects (Assessed based on RECIST criteria)，the minimum value is 0%，maximum value is 100%, and higher scores mean a better outcome., 3 months|AUCS of CEA CAR-T cells [Cell dynamics], AUCS is defined as the area under the curve in 90 days, 3 months|CMAX of CEA CAR-T cells [Cell dynamics], CMAX is defined as the highest concentration of CEA CAR-T cells expanded in peripheral blood, 3 months|TMAX of CEA CAR-T cells[Cell dynamics], TMAX is defined as the time to reach the highest concentration, 3 months|Pharmacodynamics of CEA CAR-T cells[Cell dynamics], The content of CEA in peripheral blood was detected by ELISA at the visit points specified in the research protocol, 3 months
Objective response rate (ORR) of CEA CAR-T treatment in patients with CEA-positive advanced malignancies[Effectiveness], Objective response rate includes：The proportion of subjects who achieved CR, PR after CAR-T infusion accounted for all treated subjects (Assessed based on RECIST criteria)，the minimum value is 0%，maximum value is 100%, and higher scores mean a better outcome., 2 years|Duration of Response (DOR) of CEA CAR-T treatment in patients with CEA-positive advanced malignancies[Effectiveness], DOR will be assessed from the first assessment of CR/PR/SD to the first assessment of recurrence or progression of the disease or death from any cause, 2 years|Progress-free survival(PFS) of CEA CAR-T treatment in patients with CEA-positive advanced malignancies[Effectiveness], PFS will be assessed from the first CEA-CAR-T cell infusion to death from any cause or the first assessment of progression(Assessed based on RECIST criteria), 2 years|Overall survival(OS)of CEA CAR-T treatment in patients with CEA-positive advanced malignancies[Effectiveness], OS will be assessed from the first CEA-CAR-T cell infusion to death from any cause (Assessed by investigators based on IRECIST criteria), 2 years
According to the different infusion methods, it is divided into two subgroups: intravenous infusion and local infusion through the peritoneal cavity. Each subgroup includes a dose exploration stage (Part A) and a dose expansion stage (Part B). 3 patients were explored, starting from the low-dose group, and in the dose expansion phase, the safety and efficacy were further verified according to the safe recommended dose obtained in the dose exploration phase.
