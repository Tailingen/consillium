DRUG: Penpulimab|DRUG: Anlotinib|DRUG: Nab paclitaxel|DRUG: Gemcitabine
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective response rate is defined as the percentage of subjects whose best response was complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria(RECIST v1.1)., up to 3 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Disease control rate is defined as the percentage of subjects whose best response was CR, PR or stable disease (SD) according to the RECIST v1.1., up to 3 years
Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS) (median) is determined using the number of months measured from the initial date of treatment to the recorded date of death of participants., up to 3 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free Survival (PFS) (median) was determined using the number of months measured from the initial date of treatment to the date of documented progression, or the date of death (in the absence of progression) of participants. Progression is defined using RECIST v1.1, as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., up to 3 years
