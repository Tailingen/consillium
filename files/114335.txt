Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Atorvastatin Combined With Temozolomide in the Treatment of Glioblastoma
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the primary intracranial malignant tumor with the highest morbidity and mortality, and the 5-year survival rate is less than 10%. The number of primary diagnostic patients and deaths of GBM in China ranks first in the world every year, which seriously threatens people's life and health. At present, the clinical treatment strategy of maximum surgical resection combined with concurrent chemo- and radio-therapy and TTF treatment is still not satisfactory, and the median survival time of GBM patients is only 14.4 months. Statins inhibit cholesterol production with few side effects and are widely used for cholesterol control in patients with hyperlipidemia. In recent years, statins have shown good anti-tumor effect. Our previous study found that statins can block the malignant progression of glioma mediated by EGFR pathway. Therefore, the investigators report a clinical study protocol designed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of a comprehensive treatment strategy of atorvastatin (ATO) combined with temozolomide (TMZ) in primary and recurrent glioblastomas with high EGFR expression.

The investigators designed a multicenter, single-arm, double-blind, phase II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral ATO combined with TMZ in EGFR-high expressing GBM. After informed consent was signed by the patient or authorized family members, the patients were treated with the current STUPP regimen and ATO (20mg, qn) orally. The patients were regularly followed up for 52 weeks after treatment. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), which was defined as the time from the start of GBM surgery to tumor progression (recurrence) or death. The secondary end point was the rate of tumor control, which was defined as the proportion of patients with a complete response, a partial response, or a stable disease that had shrunk or remained stable for a given period of time. Safety will be assessed during the study by monitoring of regular MRI scans, laboratory tests (liver function, lipid profile, blood routine), electrocardiography, vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, temperature), and weight.

The results of this clinical trial will provide key information on whether the oral combination of atorvastatin and temozolomide prolongs PFS in EGFR-high GBM patients with efficacy and safety.

Hepatic burden of GBM patients after receiving atorvastatin administration, This outcome is evaluation of hepatic burden of GBM patients after receiving atorvastatin administration. Since participant is enrolled in this research, peripheral blood will be collected for testing ALT, AST, GGT, ALP, TP, ALB, GLB, A/G, TBIL, DBIL, and IBIL. The physiological parameters of these index are as follows: ALT: 0\~40 U/L; AST: 0\~40 U/L; GGT: 0\~40 U/L; ALP: 40\~110 U/L; TP: 65\~85 g/L; ALB: 40\~55 g/L; GLB: 20\~40 g/L; A/G: 1.5\~2.5: 1; TBIL: 0\~23 μmol/L; DBIL: 0\~8 μmol/L; IBIL: 1\~14 μmol/L., 1, 3, and 6 months after enrollment|Percentage of participants with treatment-related adverse events, This outcome is evaluation of safety and tolerability during combination therapy of atorvastatin and STUPP protocol. Percentage of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0., 1, 3, and 6 months after enrollment
