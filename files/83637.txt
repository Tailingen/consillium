Anti-CD22 Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-Modified T Cell Therapy for Relapsed Refractory B-cell Malignancies
This is a single-center, open-label, single-arm study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of anti-CD22 CAR-T cells in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell Malignancies.
B Cell Lymphoma|Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
GENETIC: Third generation CAR-T cells
Number of participants with adverse events, Therapy-related adverse events were recorded and assessed according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, Version 4.0)., 3 years
One-month remission rate, Response of B-ALL to CAR-T therapy was assessed on day 30 (Â±2), against the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN, Version 1.2015)., 1 month|Overall survival, OS was calculated from the first CAR-T cell infusion to death or last follow-up (censored)., 3 years|Event-free survival, EFS was calculated from the first CAR-T cell infusion to death, progression of the disease, relapse or gene recurrence, whichever came first, or last visit (censored)., 3 years|Relapse-free survival, RFS was calculated from the first CAR-T cell infusion to relapse or last visit (censored)., 3 years|Rate of anti-CD22 CAR-T cells in bone marrow cells and peripheral blood cells, In vivo (bone marrow and peripheral blood) rate of CAR-T cells were determined by means of flow cytometry., 3 years|Quantity of anti-CD22 CAR-T cells in bone marrow cells and peripheral blood cells, In vivo (bone marrow and peripheral blood) quantity of CAR-T cells were determined by means of flow cytometry., 3 years|Quantity of anti-CD22 CAR copies in bone marrow cells and peripheral blood cells, In vivo (bone marrow and peripheral blood) quantity of anti-CD22 CAR copies were determined by means of qPCR., 3 years
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T cells (CAR-T cells) have the capabilities to recognize tumor associated antigen and kill tumor cells specifically. CAR-T therapy showed great effect on patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies. CAR consists of single chain variable fragment (scFv) and activation domain of T cell. In preclinical study, the researchers constructed a third generation CAR containing CD137 and CD28 costimulatory domains.

This study aims to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of anti-CD22 CAR-T cells in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell Malignancies.
