A Virtually Delivered Exercise Intervention To Mitigate Cognitive Deficits From Radiotherapy In AYAs With Brain Tumors
To test a new investigational virtual exercise program for adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with brain tumors who plan to receive cranial radiotherapy
Brain Tumor|Brain Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Standard Fitbit Program|BEHAVIORAL: Virtual Exercise Program
MD Anderson Symptom Inventory - Brain Tumor (MDASI - BT), Scale Score ranges from 0-10

0-Symptom has not been present 10-The symptom was as bad as you can imagine it could be, Through study completion an average of 1 year.
Primary Objective:

Determine the feasibility and acceptability of a virtually supervised exercise intervention compared to control in AYAs with brain tumors undergoing cranial radiotherapy (CRT).

Secondary Objective:

Assess the effect of supervised exercise intervention on the neuroanatomic structure and cognitive function changes in AYAs with brain tumors undergoing CRT.

Exploratory Objective:

Assess the effect of supervised exercise intervention on other brain structure (white matter integrity), cognitive functions (attention, visual learning, psychomotor function, executive function, verbal learning, working memory and clinician-reported neurological exam outcomes), patient-reported health-related quality of life, objectively measured and patient-reported physical activity level, patient-reported dietary recall, objectively measured physical function assessments, and exercise progression (exercise volume). Assess the agreement between physical function tests performed twice virtually.
