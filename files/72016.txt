Study on Recurrent Breast Cancer and Repeated Radiation Therapy
This study explores whether recurrent breast cancer can be safely treated with breast-conserving surgery and repeated radiation therapy in cases where patients have previously undergone radiation. Traditionally, recurrent breast cancer has been treated by removing the entire breast. However, recent research has shown that in certain situations, it may be possible to preserve the breast.

The study will collect data on the safety of this treatment approach and its effects on patients. The treatment follows standard breast cancer care practices, involving 30 patients from Helsinki and Turku University Hospitals. Patients are carefully selected based on specific criteria, such as tumor size, localization, and prior treatment history. Special attention is given to the planning of radiation therapy and surgical techniques.

The goal is to develop new treatment strategies that allow breast preservation even in cases of recurrent breast cancer, providing patients with high-quality and individualized care.
