A Study of LY2181308 Sodium in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia
The purpose of this study is to understand the safety profile of LY2181308 sodium administered in combination with idarubicin and cytarabine to patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: LY2181308 sodium|DRUG: cytarabine|DRUG: idarubicin
Number of Participants With Adverse Events (Safety Profile), Data are presented as number of participants who experienced serious adverse events (SAE) and possibly drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) during the study including the 21-day follow-up period. A summary of serious adverse events and other nonserious adverse events regardless of causality is located in the Reported Adverse Events section., Start of treatment to study completion up to 6.7 months
Percentage of Participants With Response to LY2181308 Sodium in Combination With Idarubicin and Cytarabine (Remission Rates), Response is complete remission (CR) + CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) + partial remission (PR) + cytoreduction. CR: fewer than 5% blasts based on a cell count of at least 200 cells from a bone marrow aspirate containing bone marrow spicules, in the setting of peripheral blood recovery to: platelets ≥100x10⁹/liter (L), neutrophils ≥10⁹/L. PR: defined as a decrease of at least 50% in blast count on the bone marrow aspirate; or cytoreduction (defined as a decrease in blast count not meeting the criteria for a PR or CR). Response rate is calculated as a total number of participants with CR or CRi or PR or cytoreduction divided by the total number of participants treated multiplied by 100., Baseline to progression of disease or death up to 6 months|Relapse-Free Survival, Relapse-Free Survival was defined as the time from first objective status assessment of complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) or partial remission (PR) or cytoreduction to the first time of disease progression or death as a result of any cause. CR: fewer than 5% blasts based on a cell count of at least 200 cells from a bone marrow aspirate containing bone marrow spicules, in the setting of peripheral blood recovery to: platelets ≥100x10⁹/liter (L), neutrophils ≥10⁹/L. PR: defined as a decrease of at least 50% in blast count on the bone marrow aspirate; or cytoreduction (defined as a decrease in blast count not meeting the criteria for a PR or CR). There were too few participants who had a documented progression of disease or death event amongst the participants with a response of CR, CRi, PR or cytoreduction to conduct the time-to-event analysis, thus the relapse-free survival was not analyzed., Baseline to progression of disease or death up to 6 months|Area Under the Curve of LY2181308 Over the Dosing Interval, Area under the curve of LY2181308 over the dosing interval, Day 3: 0,12,24,36,48,60,72,84,96,108,120,132 hours|Pharmacodynamics: Number of Participants With Survivin Protein Expression, Pharmacodynamics: Number of participants with Survivin Protein Expression., 6 Months|Change From Baseline in Survivin Index at Day 2, Data presented are the ratio of Day 2 survivin index to the baseline survivin index. Survivin is a protein expressed in tumor cells, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which regulates mitosis and prevents tumor cell death. Survivin index was calculated as (\[blast survivin mean equivalent fluorochrome (MEFL) - blast isotypic control MEFL\]/blast isotypic control MEFL)., Baseline, Day 2
Number of Participants Who Died Due to Progressive Disease or Unknown Cause During the 21 Days Post Study Treatment Follow-Up, Deaths due to progressive disease (PD) and unknown cause are not considered adverse events. Deaths due to PD and unknown cause occurring during the 21-day follow-up period after treatment discontinuation are reported here and for those occurring while participants were on treatment are reported in the Participant Flow. Deaths due to serious adverse events occurred during the study including the 21-day follow-up period are reported in the Reported Adverse Events section., Study treatment discontinuation up to 21 days post study treatment discontinuation
The purpose of this study is to understand the safety profile of LY2181308 sodium administered in combination with idarubicin and cytarabine to patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
