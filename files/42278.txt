Percentage of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events, To Evaluate the Safety and Tolerability of Anamorelin HCl., Over the 12-week treatment period
Change in Body Weight, Change in body weight from baseline of the original trial through Week 12 of this extension trial.|Change in Handgrip Strength of the Non-Dominant Hand, Change in HGS from baseline of the original trial through Week 12 of this extension trial.|Change in A/CS Domain Score, Change in the Functional Assessment of Anorexia/Cachexia Treatment (FAACT) 12-item Additional Concerns Subscale (A/CS) domain score is a 12-item scale. Each item is answered on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much).

The 12-items are summed together to obtain the domain score. Note that negatively phrased questions are reverse scored so that higher scores always represent improvement/less symptom burden. The total possible score for the A/CS domain ranges from 0 (worst) to 48 (best)., Change in FAACT A/CS Domain Score from baseline of the original trial through Week 12 of this extension trial
