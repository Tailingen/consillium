Lactate Imaging as a Tumour Biomarker
This project is designed to investigate whether measurements of lactate in tumours, made using a magnetic resonance technique similar to MRI, is an effective non-invasive method to detect whether some new targeted drugs are having their desired effect.

The study hypothesis is that by using magnetic resonance spectroscopy techniques, we will be able to observe changes in tumour lactate levels in vivo, in response to treatment.
Cancer
DEVICE: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
Correlation between changes in MRS lactate measurements at two time points after treatment and clinical response, 7 and 21 days post treatment
Reproducibility of MRS lactate measurement, Two baseline measurements taken at day -7 to 0 pre-treatment
Correlation between changes in post treatment MRS lactate measurements and serum lactate dehydrogenase, Baseline and 7 and 21 days post treatment
