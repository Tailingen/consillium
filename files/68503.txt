Pyridoxine and Topical Urea/Lactic Acid-Based Cream in Preventing Hand-Foot Syndrome in Patients Receiving Capecitabine for Breast Cancer or Other Cancer
RATIONALE: Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) and topical urea/lactic acid-based cream may prevent or lessen hand-foot syndrome caused by chemotherapy. It is not yet known whether giving pyridoxine with or without topical urea/lactic acid-based cream is more effective than topical urea/lactic acid-based cream alone or a placebo in preventing hand-foot syndrome.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying pyridoxine and topical urea/lactic acid-based cream to see how well they work compared with giving pyridoxine together with a placebo, giving topical urea/lactic acid-based cream together with a placebo, or giving two placebos in preventing hand-foot syndrome in patients who are receiving capecitabine for breast cancer or other cancer.

To Determine Whether the Prophylactic Use of a Topical Urea/Lactic Acid Cream Can Decrease the Incidence/Severity of Capecitabine-caused Palmar-plantar Erythrodysesthesia, A patient self-reported hand-foot syndrome (HFSD), also known as palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, was completed daily while applying the cream. Patients rated skin severity symptoms individually in their hands and in their feet. Definitions of symptoms, which were based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v3.0, were provided to patients. The number of patients reporting moderate to severe symptoms in either hands or feet were tabulated and percentages are reported., First 3 weeks of treatment

OBJECTIVES:

* Determine whether the prophylactic use of a topical urea/lactic acid cream can decrease the incidence/severity of capecitabine-caused palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia in patients receiving capecitabine for breast and/or other cancer.
* Evaluate the potential toxicity of this cream.
* Determine whether the prophylactic use of vitamin B6 can decrease the incidence and/or severity of capecitabine-caused palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia.
* Evaluate the potential toxicity of vitamin B6.
* Determine whether the prophylactic use of a topical urea/lactic acid cream in combination with vitamin B6 can decrease the incidence and/or severity of capecitabine caused palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia.

OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are stratified according to age (\< 50 years old vs 50-60 years old vs \> 60 years old), sex, capecitabine dose level (2000 mg/day vs 2500 mg/day), cancer type (breast vs other), and mode of therapy (adjuvant \[including neo-adjuvant\] therapy vs metastatic disease). Patients are randomized to 1 of 6 treatment arms (treatment arms I-IV closed to accrual as of 10/24/007).

* Arm I (closed to accrual as of 10/24/2007): Patients receive topical urea/lactic acid-based cream applied to palms and soles twice daily and oral pyridoxine once daily on days 1-21.
* Arm II (closed to accrual as of 10/24/2007): Patients receive topical urea/lactic acid-based cream as in arm I (closed to accrual as of 10/24/2007) and oral placebo once daily on days 1-21.
* Arm III (closed to accrual as of 10/24/2007): Patients receive placebo cream applied to palms and soles twice daily and pyridoxine as in arm I (closed to accrual as of 10/24/2007).
* Arm IV (closed to accrual as of 10/24/2007):Patients receive placebo cream as in arm III and oral placebo as in arm II (closed to accrual as of 10/24/2007).
* Arm V: Patients receive topical urea/lactic acid-based cream applied to palms and soles twice daily on days 1-21.
* Arm VI: Patients receive placebo cream applied to palms and soles twice daily on days 1-21.

In all arms, treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
