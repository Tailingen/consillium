Application of Telemedicine to the Management of Aggressive Lymphomas
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the value of AMA in a comparative multicenter regional study as a reference for aggressive lymphoma. The primary endpoint will be RDI. This study consider that the AMA support should allow a significant improvement of the RDI compared to the control group and thus impact the duration without progression. The study covers 350 patients recruited from 10 regional centers.
