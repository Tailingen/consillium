A Study of Aplidin (Plitidepsin) 3 h iv in Subjects With Relapsing or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
This is a phase II study to determine the efficacy following treatment with Aplidin® 5 mg/m2, given as a 3 hours intravenous infusion every 2 weeks, in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (MM).
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Plitidepsin
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Defined as the Combined Rate of Complete Response, Partial Response and Minimal Response, Complete response(CR):0 percentage the original monoclonal protein level from blood and urine Partial response(PR): ≥50 percentage reduction in the level of serum monoclonal protein Minimal response(MR):≥25 percentage to ≤ 49 percentage reduction in the level of serum monoclonal protein Stable disease: Not meeting the criteria for MR or PD. Progressive disease: \>25 percentage increase in level of serum monoclonal paraprotein, which must also be an absolute increase of at least 5 g/L and confirmed on a repeat investigation.

Treatmen failure: Reappearance of serum or urinary paraprotein, Every 2 weeks until progression or death occurs.
Time to Progression (TTP), Time to Progression (TTP):date of first infusion to the date of documented progressive disease which can be defined as \>25 percentage increase in level of serum monoclonal paraprotein., Every 2 weeks until progression or death due to progression occurs. Median TTP and TTP rates at 3 months and 6 months were assessed.|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression Free Survival (PFS): time from the date of first infusion to the date of documented progression or death, Every 2 weeks until progression or death occurs. Median PFS and PFS rates at 3 months and 6 months were assessed.|Number of Patients With Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS): time from the date of first infusion to the date of documented death, Start of treatment to death. At each patient visit while on treatment, then every 3m during follow-up. Median OS and OS rates at 6 months and 12 months were assessed.
This is a phase II study to determine the efficacy following treatment with Aplidin® 5 mg/m2, given as a 3 h iv infusion every 2 weeks, in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (MM) and to obtain the following :

* Additional pharmacokinetic information for Aplidin® given as 3-hour IV infusion every 2 weeks in patients with MM.
* To obtain additional genomic and pharmacodynamics information on MM and Aplidin.
* To assess the safety and tolerability of Aplidin® given as 3-hour IV infusion every 2 weeks in patients with MM alone or in combination with dexamethasone given orally as a 20 mg daily for 4 days
* To determine the response rate in the second cohort of patients following treatment with Aplidin®, given as a 3 hour infusion every 2 weeks, plus dexamethasone given orally as a 20 mg daily for 4 days, starting the same day of Aplidin® administration, as a second treatment stage in patients with suboptimal response to Aplidin® as single agent (progressive disease after three cycles or stable disease after four cycles).
