A Phase I Imaging and Pharmacodynamic Trial of CS-1008 in Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
This was a Phase 1, open-label, single-center study of CS-1008, an immunoglobulin G subclass 1 (IgG1) humanized monoclonal antibody, in subjects with advanced colorectal carcinoma who had received ≥ 1 prior chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease. Primary study objectives were to determine the influence of the CS-1008 dose on the biodistribution, pharmacokinetics (PK) and tumor uptake of radiolabeled CS-1008 following a single infusion and following continuous sequential doses of CS-1008. Secondary objectives were to evaluate changes in tumor metabolism, antitumor response, and changes in serum apoptosis biomarkers and tumor response markers following treatment with CS-1008.

Number of Subjects With Best Overall Tumor Response, Tumor responses were evaluated using appropriate imaging and categorized according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), Version 1.1, at Screening, at the end of every odd-numbered cycle (i.e., Cycles 1, 3, and 5, as applicable), and at the time of treatment discontinuation. Per RECIST 1.1, target lesions are categorized as follows: Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR): ≥ 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD): ≥ 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD): small changes that do not meet above criteria (Eisenhauer et al. Eur J Cancer 2009;45:228-47)., Up to 7 months|Number of Subjects With Best Overall Metabolic Response, Metabolic response to CS-1008 was assessed by fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18\^F-FDG PET) at Screening, Day 15, and at the End of Cycle 1/End of Study visit (Days 44-50). For each FDG-PET performed, the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) corrected for body weight for all target lesions \>2 cm identified on CT imaging was calculated using region of interest (ROI). The ROI was determined with the aid of the anatomical detail provided by the CT scan. Tumor metabolic response to CS-1008 was assessed by 18\^F-FDG PET/CT calculated using the target lesion with the greatest baseline SUVmax, and was categorized according to the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) guidelines (Young et al. Eur J Cancer 1999;35:1773-82)., Up to 50 days
Eligible subjects were to be enrolled into one of 5 dose-escalation cohorts to receive CS-1008 administered weekly as an intravenous (IV) infusion over 30 ± 10 minutes. Each cohort initially comprised 2 subjects but was expanded in up to 5 subjects if additional biodistribution and/or PK data were required.

The initial infusion of CS-1008 on Day 1 was trace labeled with Indium-111 (111\^In-CS-1008; 5-7 mCi) and was investigated at escalating doses up to the standard loading dose, as follows: Cohort 1 (0.2 mg/kg), Cohort 2 (1 mg/kg), Cohort 3 (2 mg/kg), Cohort 4 (4 mg/kg), and Cohort 5 (6 mg/kg). The initial 111\^In-CS-1008 dose was followed by gamma camera imaging with blood sampling over a 10-day period to evaluate biodistribution, tumor uptake, PK, and serum biomarkers. Day 8 dosing comprised non-labeled CS-1008 at doses of 6 mg/kg in Cohorts 1-3, 4 mg/kg in Cohort 4, and 2 mg/kg in Cohort 5. Subsequent weekly infusions of standard dose CS-1008 (2 mg/kg) were administered on Days 15, 22, 29, 36, and 43. The Day 36 infusion of CS-1008 was also trace labeled with 111\^In (5-7 mCi), with subsequent gamma camera imaging and blood sampling.

Subjects were assessed for disease status using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, serum tumor biomarkers (carcinoembryonic antigen \[CEA\]), and human-anti-CS-1008-antibody development (HAHA). Subjects were assessed for changes in tumor metabolism following CS-1008 administration using computed tomography (CT) or fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18\^F-FDG PET) scans.

Cycle 1 encompassed the first 7 weeks of therapy. Within 1 week (Days 44-50) after the last infusion of CS-1008, subjects completed an End of Study/End of Cycle 1 assessment. Subjects with stable disease or better (according to RECIST version 1.1) at the Day 44-50 reassessment were permitted to receive additional 4-week cycles of CS-1008 (2 mg/kg) until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or subject/physician decision.
