Venetoclax and Azacitidine Combined With Homoharringtonine, Followed by Allo-HSCT for Intermediate and High-risk AML.
This study is a single-center, single-arm, prospective phase II clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of the VAH (Venetoclax and Azacitidine combined with Homoharringtonine) regimen, followed by allo-HSCT for intermediate and high-risk AML. Eligible patients receive two cycles of the VAH chemotherapy regimen. If minimal residual disease (MRD) is negative after these two cycles, patients proceed to the transplantation process. If MRD remains positive, patients receive an additional two cycles of the VAH regimen. Upon achieving MRD negativity, they then proceed to the transplantation process.

The conditioning regimen includes fludarabine at 30 mg/m²/day from day -7 to day -3 (5 days), cytarabine at 1-1.5 g/m²/day from day -7 to day -3 (5 days), and busulfan at 3.2 mg/kg/day from day -5 to day -3 (3 days). Conditioning begins on day -6, and donor hematopoietic stem cell infusion is performed on day 0.

All patients will undergo bone marrow examination on day 14 and day 28 post-transplant, followed by bone marrow examinations every 30 days within the first year after transplantation, and every 60 days within the second year. If disease relapse is suspected during the follow-up period, bone marrow or extramedullary relapse site examinations will be conducted at any time.

The primary endpoint is the 1-year and 2-year overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints include the complete response (CR) rate after 1 and 2 cycles of chemotherapy; 1-year and 2-year disease-free survival (DFS) following the achievement of CR through induction therapy; cumulative relapse rate; non-relapse mortality (NRM); incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) within 180 days post-transplant; and the cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD within 1 year and 2 years post-transplant.
