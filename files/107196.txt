AlloStim® In-Situ Vaccine in Pre-Treated Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
This is a personalized anti-cancer vaccine protocol which includes an in-situ (in the body) cancer vaccine step which combines killing a single metastatic tumor lesion by use of cryoablation in order to cause the release of tumor-specific markers to the immune system and then injecting bioengineered allogeneic immune cells (AlloStim) into the lesion as an adjuvant in order to modulate the immune response and educate the immune system to kill other tumor cells where ever they reside in the body.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: AlloStim®|PROCEDURE: cryoablation|OTHER: Physician's Choice (PC)
Overall Survival, To assess whether cryoablation combined with AlloStim treatment (arm 1) provides an overall survival (OS) advantage when compared to treatment with cryoablation combined with physician's choice (arm 2)., from randomization within 30 days of accrual to death for any cause followed for up to 2 years from date of randomization
Safety, Safety will be evaluated by physical exam, changes in laboratory values and patient reported symptoms, 168 days from randomization|Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL), To assess change in HRQoL between treatment arms, 168 days from randomization
Immunological Response, blood samples will be evaluated for immunological response and a determination made as to whether immunological response correlates with survival, 168 days from randomization|Longitudinal changes in tumor burden, To document the longitudinal changes in tumor burden by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and Immune-Related Response Criteria (irRC), 168 days from randomization
Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks as the third most common cancer worldwide. Metastasis is the main reason of death in CRC patients. The current drugs used to treat colorectal cancer provide important treatment options for patients, their limitations including drug resistance, poor efficacy and severe side effects. Development of new therapeutic strategies for KRAS mutant as well as BRAF mutant tumors are therefore highly needed in order to offer a new category of drug (immunotherapy). This study targets the population of mCRC patients that have progressed after two lines of chemotherapy and are not eligible for targeted therapies due to a mutation in KRAS or BRAF.

This is a Phase II/III, randomized, open-label, multicenter, controlled, two arm study designed to determine the efficacy in terms of OS and the safety of the InSituVax (AlloStim+ Cryoablation) personalized in-situ anti-cancer vaccine protocol (Treatment Arm) compared with Physician's Choice (PC) of Treatment + Cryoablation (Control Arm) in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer. Subjects are randomized 2:1 into the treatment or control arms.
