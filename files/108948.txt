Evaluation of the Cell Detachment Ratio on pH-responsive Chitosan as a Prognostic Factor in Lung Cancer
Biomaterial-based cell culture models have been gaining increasing attention as potential therapeutic strategies. The purpose of this project is to evaluate whether the cell detachment ratio on pH-responsive chitosan could be correlated with the overall survival in lung cancer patients. Through controllable cell-material interaction, this project has the intention to develop an alternative tool for both early diagnosis and accurate prognosis in cancer therapeutics.
Clinical Decision-Making|Early Detection of Cancer
The correlation between the cell detachment ratio and the overall survival, The purpose of this project is to evaluate whether the cell detachment ratio on pH-responsive chitosan could be correlated with the overall survival in lung cancer patients, hence serve as a prognostic factor for therapeutic strategies. The patient's information required for meta-analysis will be retrieved from medical records, and the log-term follow-up will be conducted., 5-year follow-up after tumor resection
The analyses of the detached cells by specific markers, The isolated and purified patient-derived tumor cells will be characterized by the expression of surface markers using flow cytometry., About one week
