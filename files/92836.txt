Continuous or Intermittent Extension of Adjuvant Pyrotinib for Invasive HER2-positive Breast Cancer
This is a prospective, randomised, controlled, multicentre study to compare the efficacy and safety between continuous or intermittent extension of adjuvant pyrotinib in invasive human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer.
Breast Cancer Invasive
DRUG: pyrotinib
Invasive Disease-free Survival (iDFS), Invasive disease-free survival time is defined as the time from date of randomization until the first invasive disease recurrence of the following events: invasive ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence, invasive contralateral breast cancer, local/regional invasive recurrence, distant recurrence and death from any cause., From randomization until time of event up to 2 years.
Disease-free Survival (DFS), Disease-free survival time is defined as the time from date of randomization until the first disease recurrence of the following events: invasive ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence, invasive contralateral breast cancer, local/regional invasive recurrence, non-breast primary invasive cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS),or distant recurrence and death from any cause, From randomization until time of event up to 2 years|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause., From randomization until time of event up to 2 years|Adverse events, Adverse events will be assessed according to the NCI CTCAE v5.0., From the date of starting pyrotinib to the end of the treatment (up to approximately 1 year)
