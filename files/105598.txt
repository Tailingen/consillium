PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Determine the feasibility and usability of the Work Ability Improvement Through Symptom Management and Ergonomic Strategies (WISE) and empirically evaluate its effect on short-term work ability among breast cancer survivors (BCS).

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Explore individual and workplace factors associated with work ability in BCS.

OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

ARM I: Patients receive access to the WISE web-based educational intervention to help BCS manage their symptoms, identify ergonomic workplace problems and risks, and implement ergonomic modifications. Patients also receive standard of care comprising symptom management therapies and a pamphlet on employment rights.

ARM II: Patients receive standard of care comprising symptom management therapies and a pamphlet on employment rights.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 and 6 months.
