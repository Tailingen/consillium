This study was designed to simulate a real-world application of Exact Science's Multicancer Early Detection (MCED) test. Participants will be offered the Exact Science's MCED test annually for 3 years. If at any point during those 3 years a participant is diagnosed with cancer, they will become ineligible for further testing. Data will be collected for 5 years following the baseline test.

There will be two data collection approaches as part of this study. The first will be collection of self-report data related to the testing experience. The second will be periodic and largely automated extraction of pre-specified data elements from existing electronic data sources. A comparison data set will be constructed from records of individuals who did not receive the MCED test.
