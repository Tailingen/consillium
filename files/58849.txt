Fluorouracil Treatment Via Colon for Colorectal Cancer
Fluorouracil (5-FU) is a commonly used drug for colorectal cancer (CRC). Thermosensitive hydrogel presents a promising carrier for 5-FU to address challenges encountered with traditional administration methods. We propose an integrated approach utilizing colonic transendoscopic enteral tubing to cover the entire colon flexibly, coupled with a thermo-sensitive gel to enhance the adhesion of 5-FU. This clinical trial aims to assess the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of this approach for treating CRC.

DRUG: Colonic local administration of fluorouracil with enhanced adhesion
Objective response rate (according to RECIST1.1, investigator assessment), Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) proportion of participants., One, three, and six months (or until conversion to surgery) after the initial treatment
Progression-free survival, Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the first initiation of study regimen treatment to the first imaging disease progression or the time of death, whichever occurs first., One, three, and six months (or until conversion to surgery) after the initial treatment|Overall survival, Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from the first initiation of the study regimen to death from any cause time., Every 3 months up to 24 months after the end of treatment|Disease control rate (according to RECIST1.1, investigator assessment), Disease control rate (DCR) is defined as the proportion of participants with complete response (CR), partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD) Ã— 100%., One, three, and six months (or before conversion to surgery) after the initial treatment|Drop period to ensure operation resection, Drop period to ensure operation resection is defined as the proportion of participants whose tumors shrink following study induction therapy, thereby enhancing the safety and feasibility of surgical removal., Time from the first treatment to 4-6 cycles (each cycle is 28 days) of treatment|Converted resection rate, Surgical conversion rate, defined as the proportion of participants who achieved gross complete resection after 4-6 courses of study induction therapy., Time from the first treatment to 4-6 cycles (each cycle is 28 days) of treatment|Actual R0 resection rate, Actual R0 resection rate is defined as the proportion of participants who achieved R0 surgical resection after 4-6 courses of study induction therapy., Time from the first treatment to 4-6 cycles (each cycle is 28 days) of treatment|The incidence of treatment-related adverse events (AE) assessed by CTCAE, Version 5.0, The severity of AE was graded as mild (grade 1), moderate (grade 2), severe/disabling (grade 3), life threatening (grade 4), and death (grade 5). All AE were divided in definitely, probably and possibly related to treatment., Throughout the treatment period and continuing for an additional 6 months after the treatment concludes, an average of 1 year
