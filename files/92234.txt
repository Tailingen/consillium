Phase 2 Trial of Voyager V1 in Combination With Cemiplimab in Cancer Patients
This is a Phase 2 study designed to determine the preliminary anti-tumor activity and confirm the safety of VV1 in combination with cemiplimab. The study will enroll patients with three distinct separate tumor cohorts. The cancers types are colorectal, head and neck carcinoma, and melanoma that are progressing on CPI treatment.
Melanoma|Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma|Colo-rectal Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: VV1|BIOLOGICAL: Cemiplimab
Objective response rate (ORR) per imaging assessment, Percentage of participants with objective response is assessed every six weeks from Cycle 1 Day 1 through disease progression, by investigator review based on RECIST version 1.1, within 24 months
Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events assessed by CTCAE v5.0, Safety and tolerability, within 24 months|Serum concentration time, Serum concentration time data using RT-PCR of VSV-IFNβ-NIS and systemic cemiplimab levels, within 24 months|To investigate the pharmacodynamics (PD) of VV1 by measuring serum IFNβ, To investigate the pharmacodynamics (PD) of VV1 by measuring serum IFNβ expression, within 24 months
Patients enrolled into three parallel doublet cohorts with an optimal Simon's two stage design. Patients will receive Voyager V1 as a direct to tumor injection (IT) in all 3 cancer groups and cemiplimab via IV infusion. Patients will return for treatment every 3 weeks until lack of clinical benefit or limiting toxicity. Efficacy evaluations will be conducted every 6 weeks.
