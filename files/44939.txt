PD-1 Inhibitor Combined With Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy Plus Surgery for Locally Advanced ESCC (NEOCRTEC2101)
The primary objective is to compare PD-1 inhibitor combined with preoperative chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery versus neo-adjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery, in terms of the overall survival time (OS) in patients with Stage T1-4aN1-3M0 or T3-4aN0M0 squamous cell esophageal carcinoma.

Overall survival, Overall survival will be calculated from the date of randomization and an event registered on the date of death from any cause. Patients lost to follow up, or those with no death recorded on the day the database is frozen, will be censored on the date of last follow up., At end of enrollment- up to 5 years in follow up
Progression free survival, Progression free survival is defined as the time from randomization until objective tumor progression or death., At end of enrollment- up to 5 years in follow up|Pathologic complete response rate, No malignant tumor cells were detected in the removed specimens including primary tumor and lymph nodes, Two weeks after surgery|R0 resection rate, The percentage of patients who undergo complete resection, Two weeks after surgery|Incidence of perioperative complications, Incidence of complications, Ninety days after surgery|Perioperative mortality, Incidence of death postoperatively, Ninety after surgery
