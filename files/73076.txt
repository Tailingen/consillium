Carboplatin Intensified Chemotherapy for TRIple NEgative Breast Cancer(CITRINE)
This is a prospective, single center, randomized, open-labled stage III clinical trial comparing the efficacy and safety of anthracyclin followed by weekly paclitaxel versus dose-dense anthracyclin followed by weekly paclitaxel versus dose-dense anthracyclin followed by weekly paclitaxel combined with carboplatin for high-risk, triple-negative early breast cancer.

This is a prospective, single center, randomized, open-labled stage III clinical trial comparing the efficacy and safety of anthracyclin followed by weekly paclitaxel versus dose-dense anthracyclin followed by weekly paclitaxel versus dose-dense anthracyclin followed by weekly paclitaxel combined with carboplatin for high-risk, triple-negative early breast cancer.High risk is defined as positive lymph nodes or negative lymph nodes but ki-67 is not less than 50%. We aim to explore whether the addition of carboplatin can improve the disease-free survival of early high-risk triple-negative breast cancer. At the same time, the experimental group's anthracyclines must be given in a dose-dense manner, while anthracyclines in the control group are dose-dense or not.
