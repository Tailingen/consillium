Vemurafenib and Panitumumab Combination Therapy in Patients With BRAF V600E Mutated Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
The purpose of this study is to test a new drug combination consisting of two drugs, vemurafenib (also known as ZelborafTM) and panitumumab (also known as VectibixTM). This treatment is being tested in a subgroup of patients with colorectal cancer whose tumors have changes in the BRAF gene that may make them more likely to respond to this new drug combination.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: combination panitumumab and vemurafenib
objective response rate (ORR), Overall response will be estimated based on best response to this combination in six months of treatment., 6 months
progression-free survival (PFS), Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the period elapsing between the date of initiation of therapy and the date of either disease progression or date of death, whichever is earlier., 2 years|overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the interval between the time of initiation of therapy and the date of death from any cause. Patients who are alive at the time of study completion will be censored at the time the patient was last known to be alive., 2 years|safety, tolerability, and adverse event profile, The safety endpoints will include all types of adverse experiences, laboratory safety measurements, ECOG performance scale status, and vital signs. Adverse experiences will be graded and recorded throughout the study according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0., 1 year|efficacy, using pre- and post-vemurafenib tumor biopsies obtained from the first 10 patients participating in this trial., 2 years
