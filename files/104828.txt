A Study of Ociperlimab With Tislelizumab Compared to Pembrolizumab in Participants With Untreated Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ociperlimab + tislelizumab compared with that of pembrolizumab in adults with PD-L1 high, locally advanced/recurrent or untreated metastatic NSCLC.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer|NSCLC
DRUG: Tislelizumab|DRUG: Ociperlimab|DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Placebo
Overall Survival (OS), OS will be defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause., Up to approximately 58 months
Progression-free Survival (PFS) As Assessed By Investigators, PFS will be defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first objectively documented tumor progression per RECIST v1.1, or death, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 58 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR) As Assessed By Investigators, ORR will be defined as the proportion of participants with a documented, confirmed complete response or partial response per RECIST v1.1., Up to approximately 58 months|Duration Of Response (DOR) As Assessed By Investigators, DOR will be defined as the time from the first determination of an objective response per RECIST v1.1 until the first documentation of progression or death, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 58 months|Health-related Quality Of Life (HRQoL): European Organization For Research And Treatment Of Cancer Quality Of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), HRQoL will be assessed via patient-reported outcomes (PRO) using the EORTC QLQ-C30.

The EORTC QLQ-C30 (Version 3) consists of Global health status/QoL (score range from 0=very poor to 7=excellent), 5 functioning scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, social), 8 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, pain, dyspnea, insomnia, constipation, diarrhea) and financial difficulties with scores ranging from 1 = "Not at all" to 4 = "Very much". For the global health status/QoL and functioning scales, higher scores indicate better outcomes and for symptom scales, lower scores indicate better outcomes., Within 7 days after permanent treatment discontinuation|HRQoL: EORTC Lung Cancer Module Quality of Life Questionnaire Lung Cancer 13 (QLQ-LC13) HRQoL will be assessed via PRO using the EORTC QLQ-LC13., QLQ-LC13 consists of 10 scales, scores ranging from 1 = "not at all" to 4 = "very much", and 2 questions regarding use of pain medication (yes/no) and if yes, did it help (1 = "not at all" to 4 = "very much"). In symptom scales, lower scores indicate better outcomes., Within 7 days after permanent treatment discontinuation|HRQoL: European Quality of Life-5 Level- 5 Dimension (EQ-5D-5L) Questionnaire, HRQoL will be assessed via PRO using the EQ-5D-5L. The EQ-5D-5L comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression, and a visual analog scale (VAS). Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. The VAS records the respondent's self-rated health on a 0 to 100 scale, with 100 = "the best health you can imagine" and 0 = "'the worst health you can imagine". Lower scores in descriptive dimension indicate better HRQoL and higher VAS scores indicates better health state., Within 7 days after permanent treatment discontinuation|Time To Deterioration (TTD), TTD will be analyzed using PRO scores, and will be defined as worsening scores of ≥10 points from baseline for 2 consecutive assessments or 1 assessment followed by death from any cause., Within 7 days after permanent treatment discontinuation|Number Of Participants Experiencing Adverse Events (AEs), The incidence and severity of AEs will be determined according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0 (NCI CTCAE v5.0)., 90 days (±14) after last dose
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ociperlimab + tislelizumab compared with that of pembrolizumab in adults with PD-L1 high, locally advanced/recurrent or untreated metastatic NSCLC.
