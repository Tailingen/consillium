Cancer Information Your Way: Get What You Need to Make Your Decisions
People diagnosed with cancer may face many difficult decisions regarding their care and preferences. This may be particularly challenging when the cancer cannot be cured. It is therefore hugely important that patients have the information they need so that they can be involved in these decisions and in their care.

This qualitative interview study aims to hear from patients who might have found that the information they were given wasn't easy to understand, or who haven't been able to get involved in their care as much as they would have liked. We hope to learn from these experiences in order to improve the way patients are given information and supported to become involved in their care.
