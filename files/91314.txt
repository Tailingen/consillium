Virtual Reality Experiences for Anxiety and Pain Control
This trial studies the impact of virtual reality experiences on anxiety before surgery and pain after surgery. The goal of this study is to examine how different virtual reality experiences may help reduce anxiety and improve pain control, which may help reduce the need for medications such as opioids.

Change in preoperative anxiety scores, Assessed by visual analogue scale (VAS) from 0-100mm., Baseline up to pre surgery (estimated 1 day)|Change in postoperative pain scores, Assessed by VAS scale from 0-100mm., Baseline after surgery up to study completion (estimated 1 day)

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To measure the impact of a gaming virtual reality (VR) experience compared to a mindfulness VR experience on preoperative anxiety and postoperative pain.

OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

ARM I: Patients participate in a VR intervention (Angry Birds) over 15 minutes before standard of care surgery and then participate in a VR intervention (TRIPP) over 15 minutes after surgery.

ARM II: Patients participate in a VR intervention (TRIPP) over 15 minutes before standard of care surgery and then participate in a VR intervention (Angry Birds) over 15 minutes after surgery.
