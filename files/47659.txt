Clinical Study of Plitidepsin (Aplidin®) in Combination With Cytarabine in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Leukemia
This is a Phase I/II study to determine the safety, tolerability and to identify the MTD and DLT of Plitidepsin in combination with a fixed dose of Cytarabine in patients with relapsed/refractory leukemia and to determine the response rate of the combination of Plitidepsin with Cytarabine in patients with relapsed/refractory AML treated at the MTD.
Relapsed/Refractory Leukemia
DRUG: Plitidepsin plus Cytarabine
Máximum Tolerate Dose, To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Plitidepsin (Aplidin®) when administered daily x 5 days with a fixed dose of Cytarabine for 5 days every four weeks in patients with relapsed/refractory leukemia., Until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity|Dose Limiting Toxicity, To determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of Plitidepsin (Aplidin®) when administered daily x 5 days with a fixed dose of Cytarabine for 5 days every four weeks in patients with relapsed/refractory leukemia., Until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity|Response Rate, To determine the response rate of the combination of Plitidepsin with Cytarabine in patients with relapsed/refractory AML treated at the MTD., Until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity
This is a Phase I/II study to determine:

* the safety, tolerability and to identify the MTD and DLT of Plitidepsin in combination with a fixed dose of Cytarabine in patients with relapsed/refractory leukemia and to determine the response rate of the combination of Plitidepsin with Cytarabine in patients with relapsed/refractory AML treated at the MTD.
* the pharmacokinetic parameters of Plitidepsin in combination with Cytarabine.
* whether Plitidepsin in combination with Cytarabine exerts antiangiogenic effects as measured by reduction in microvessel density and VEGFR-1 expression in bone marrow biopsies of patients with relapsed/refractory leukemia.
* whether measurement of free serum VEGF levels, soluble circulating VEGF Receptor and Peripheral Progenitor Endothelial cells provide an early marker of response to Plitidepsin.
* the effects of Plitidepsin and Cytarabine on cytidine deaminase activity and correlate results with Cytarabine drug resistance.
* changes in leukemic gene expression as a result of Plitidepsin and Cytarabine administration.
* tumor response duration.
* progression free survival and overall survival.
