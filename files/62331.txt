De-escalation Immunotherapy mAintenance Duration Trial for Stage IV Lung Cancer Patients With Disease Control After Chemo-immunotherapy Induction
Immunotherapeutic approaches recently have demonstrated clinical efficacy in several cancer types, including melanoma and NSCLC. As a matter of fact, first registration trials of immune-checkpoints inhibitors (ICI) in second-line settings (pembrolizumab as well as nivolumab or atezolizumab) had stated that ICI could be continued until disease progression or not tolerable toxicity, up to 5 years. This is only for the first-line registration studies that the arbitrary maximal duration of treatment of 2 years was set up by the Companies sponsoring such trials.

The aim is to study a de-escalation scheme of treatment from 2 years of immunotherapy to 6 months (27-weeks), in patients with controlled disease.
Metastatic NSCLC
DRUG: Pembrolizumab before randomization|DRUG: Chemotherapy|DRUG: Pemetrexed|DRUG: Pembrolizumab after randomization
Phase II: 18-month overall survival (OS), Rate of patients not dead 18 months after inclusion, 18 months after inclusion|Phase III: overall survival, Time from date of inclusion to the date of death due to any cause, about 24 months after randomization
Incidence, nature, and severity of adverse events, Graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 5.0 (NCI CTCAE v5.0), about 24 months after randomization|Time until definitive health related quality of life score deterioration, The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30/LC13 questionnaire will be used to determine time until definitive HRQoL score deterioration., about 24 months after randomization|Change from baseline of EuroQol Quality of Life 5-Dimension 5-Level Scale, Change from baseline of EuroQol Quality of Life 5-Dimension 5-Level Scale (EQ-5D-5L) at all scheduled time points., about 24 months after randomization|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Time between the date of randomization and the first date of documented progression, as determined by investigator, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., about 24 months after randomization|OS according to histological subtype, Time from date of inclusion to the date of death due to any cause according to histological subtype., about 24 months after randomization|PFS according to histological subtype, Time between the date of randomization and the first date of documented progression, as determined by investigator, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first according to histological subtype., about 24 months after randomization|OS according to PDL1 tumor level, Time from date of inclusion to the date of death due to any cause according to PDL1 tumor level., about 24 months after randomization|PFS according to PDL1 tumor level, Time between the date of randomization and the first date of documented progression, as determined by investigator, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first according to PDL1 tumor level., about 24 months after randomization
This is a phase II-III randomized, open-labelled, multicentre study for NSCLC patients who are naive of treatment for advanced disease. Patients will be given first-line chemotherapy + pembrolizumab: platinum doublet for at least 3 cycles, either paclitaxel-carboplatin for patient with SCC or 3 cycles of pemetrexed-platinum salt followed by 2 cycles of pemetrexed and 6 cycles of pembrolizumab.

Only patients with disease control, confirmed at 6 months (27-weeks) without drug-related toxicity imposing treatment discontinuation will be randomized 1:1 either to continuation of pembrolizumab (± pemetrexed for non-SCC) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or 2 years, or observation (± pemetrexed for non-SCC).

Patients will be stratified by performance status (0 versus 1), histology (SCC versus non-SCC), PD-L1 (PD-L1 \< 1% versus 49%≥PD-L1 ≥ 1% versus PD-L1\>49%), sex and response at randomization (partial response versus stabilisation).
