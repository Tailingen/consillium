Role of the Peritoneal Microenvironment in the Pathogenesis and Spread of Colorectal Carcinomatosis
The goal of this project is to investigate the extent and role of mesothelial - mesenchymal transition (MMT) and cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the pathogenesis of colorectal peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC).
Peritoneal Carcinomatosis
PROCEDURE: Sampling peritoneal tissue
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis, Extensive IHC analysis will be performed including CD44, integrins, ICAM-1, hyaluronate, and VCAM-1 (adhesion molecules); calretinin, mesothelin, WT1, cytokeratins and E-cadherin (mesothelial markers); Î±-SMA, FAP and podoplanin (CAF specific markers); PDGF, VEGF and EDGF (angiogenesis related markers), Within 6 months after collection of the samples
Intra-tumoral versus peritoneal vascularity, Vacularity will be assed using chalkley counts, Within 6 months after collection of the samples|Laser capture microdisssection (LCM) followed by gene expression analysis, Different cell types (mesothelial cells, submesothelial resident fibroblasts, CAFs) will be isolated using LCM, followed by gene expression analysis, Within 12 months after collection of the samples
The goal of this project is to investigate the extent and role of mesothelial - mesenchymal transition (MMT) and cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the pathogenesis of colorectal peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC).
