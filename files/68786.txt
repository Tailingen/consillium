Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) Trial for Palliation of Cholangiocarcinoma
This research study is a phase III double arm, multicenter, randomized controlled clinical trial comparing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and stenting plus photodynamic therapy (PDT) versus ERCP with stenting alone in adult patients with unresectable cholangiocarcinoma.

The study objectives are to investigate the efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT) in increasing the survival time of patients with unresectable cholangiocarcinoma and to assess the effect of PDT on both cholestasis and health-related quality of life (HRQoL).
