A Study of FDA022-BB05 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Malignant Tumors
This is a Phase 1, open-label and two-part study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of FDA022-BB05 in participants with advanced/metastatic solid malignant tumors.

This is a first-in-human (FIH), Phase 1, open-label, dose escalation and dose expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of FDA022-BB05 in patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumors. FDA022-BB05 is administered via intravenous infusion using an accelerated titration method followed by a conventional 3 + 3 study design to identify dose-limiting toxicities（DLT）and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) through Day1 and Day 21 (cycle 1) with 1 dose. In addition, the recommended Phase II dose of FDA022-BB05 will be determined.
