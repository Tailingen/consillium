INTERVAL: Ipilimumab and Nivolumab Combination Therapy: A Study of a Supervised or Semi-Supervised Exercise InteRVention or Usual Care With Functional Capacity and Quality of Life Evaluations in Subjects With Advanced or Metastatic RenAL Cell Carcinoma
This study aims to report the effects of immediate or delayed exercise training on patients with advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma who are receiving nivolumab and ipilimumab.
Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma
BEHAVIORAL: Exercise
Change in Cardiopulmonary function, Change in VO2 peak, Baseline, 13 weeks
Patient-reported fatigue as measured by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue scale, The FACIT-F measures severity and impact of fatigue on functioning and health-related quality of life experienced in past seven days using 40 statements that patients are asked to rate as 0-4 with 0 being "Not at all" and 4 being "Very much"., 13 weeks|Patient-reported activity as measured by the Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire, The Godin Leisure is a patient-reported outcome tool to measure activity, 13 weeks|Patient-reported symptoms as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Kidney Symptom Index-19 (FKSI-19), The FKSI-19 is a patient-reported outcome tool to measure symptoms of Cancer, 13 weeks|Patient health outcome as measured by the EQ-5D health questionnaire, The EQ-5d is a patient-reported outcome tool to measure health, 13 weeks|Patient-reported activity as measured by the Stanford Brief Activity Survey, The Stanford Brief Activity Survey is a patient-reported outcome tool to measure activity, 13 weeks|Patient-reported activity as measured by the Incidental and Planned Activity Questionnaire, The Incidental and Planned Activity Questionnaire is a patient-reported outcome tool to measure activity, 13 weeks
Exercise interventions also have been shown to improve both cancer- and treatment-related fatigue and quality of life across multiple tumor types. Thus, an exercise intervention could improve the tolerability of combination immunotherapy. Furthermore, functional capacity and/or amount of physical activity are associated with survival in several cancers. Finally, there is emerging evidence that exercise training may augment beneficial cancer-specific immune function. This study will examine parallel groups of supervised or semi-supervised exercise training or usual care in patients with mRCC treated with nivolumab and ipilimumab combination therapy. Fitness level will be evaluated by cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), wearable exercise tracking devices and questionnaires after 12 weeks of semi-supervised, home-based exercise.
