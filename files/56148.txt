Study of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in Adults With Recurrent/Metastatic Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (cSCC) or Locally Advanced Unresectable cSCC (MK-3475-629/KEYNOTE-629)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in adult participants with recurrent or metastatic(R/M) cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (cSCC) or locally advanced (LA) unresectable cSCC that is not amenable to surgery and/or radiation and/or systemic therapies.
Squamous Cell Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who have best response of Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or Partial Response (PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1). ORR per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) is presented., Up to approximately 32 months
Duration of Response (DOR), For participants who demonstrated a confirmed CR or PR per RECIST 1.1, DOR was defined as the time from first documented evidence of a CR or PR until progressive disease (PD) or death. Per RECIST 1.1, PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions as well as an absolute increase of at least a 5 mm in the sum of diameters. The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered PD. The DOR per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR is presented for all participants who experienced a confirmed CR or PR., Up to approximately 56 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of participants who have a CR or PR or Stable Disease (SD: Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease). The DCR per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR is presented., Up to approximately 56 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from first dose of study treatment to the first documented PD or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. PFS per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR is presented., Up to approximately 56 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from first dose of study treatment to death due to any cause. The OS for all participants is presented., Up to approximately 56 months|Number of Participants Who Experienced One or More Adverse Events (AEs), An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease (new or worsening) temporally associated with the use of study therapy, regardless of whether or not a causal relationship with the study therapy. The number of participants who experienced an AE is presented., Up to approximately 56 months|Number of Participants Who Discontinued Study Treatment Due to AE, An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease (new or worsening) temporally associated with the use of study therapy, regardless of whether or not a causal relationship with the study therapy. The number of participants who discontinued study treatment due to an AE is presented., Up to approximately 56 months
