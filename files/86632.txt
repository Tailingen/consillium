Combination of Stereotactic Radiosurgery and Enhanced Immunotherapy for Recurrent Glioblastomas(inSituVac2)(CSREIG)
The study will investigate combined stereotactic radiosurgery and enhanced immunotherapy for recurrent glioblastomas. Immune adjuvants will be injected intratumorally and systemically to induce antitumor-specific immunity after radiation induced immunological tumor cell death (ICD). With radiation, tumor cells release tumor antigens that are captured by antigen presenting dendritic cells. Immune adjuvants promote the presentation of tumor antigens and the priming of antitumor T lymphocytes. The combined treatment induces and amplifies the specific antitumor immunity in patients with recurrent glioblastomas, prolonging survivals of patients.

Recurrent glioblatoma (rGBM) is an aggressive malignancy with a poor prognosis. There is no standard therapy and survival is less than 9 months. Recently, personalized cancer immunotherapy has shown great promise in treating different types of cancers. However, effective immunotherapies for rGBMs have yet to be established. The last clinical trial (inSituVac1) showed promised results and this study was based on it. We will investigate whether combining stereotactic radiosurgery with intratumoral and systemic administration of enhanced immune adjuvants will improve the treatment outcome of rGBMs. We will use several immune adjuvants that activate innate and adaptive immunity.
