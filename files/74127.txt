The Efficacy and Safety of Low-dose Radiotherapy Combined With Sintilimab and Temozolomide in Recurrent Glioblastoma
This is an open-label, single-arm, phase II clinical trial to explore the efficacy and safety of low-dose radiotherapy combined with programmed death 1 (PD-1) inhibitor (sintilimab) and temozolomide in recurrent glioblastoma. The eligible patients are scheduled to administered sintilimab 200mg D1 Q3W temozolomide 50mg/m2 QD and radiotherapy 1Gy/1F D1/D2/D8/D15 Q3W for 4-6 cycles, then sintilimab for maintenance. The overall primary study hypothesis is that the combination regimen of low-dose radiotherapy, sintilimab and temozolomide is safe and feasible in the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma.
