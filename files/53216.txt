Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Treosulfan Based Conditioning Prior to Allogeneic Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)
This is a multicentric, non-randomized, non-controlled open-label phase II trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of treosulfan in a combination regimen with fludarabine as conditioning therapy prior to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) in patients with haematological malignancies.

The aim is to demonstrate a clinical benefit compared with historical data on intravenous busulfan (BusulfexTM, BusilvexTM), the only drug so far registered in the indication conditioning before allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
