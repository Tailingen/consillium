This will be a Phase 1b/2a multicenter 2-stage study. Phase 1 will be conducted as a dose-finding, open-label study of oral RX-3117 administered in combination with Abraxane® to subjects with metastatic pancreatic cancer. The recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and schedule of RX-3117, in combination with Abraxane®, will be determined based on the safety profile, dose modification, and pharmacokinetics (PK). Phase 1 will be conducted using a combination of the single agent maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for RX-3117 and the Abraxane dose as per the package insert for patients with pancreatic cancer in combination with gemcitabine.

After completion of the Phase 1 portion, a Phase 2a study will be conducted using a 2 stage, open-label design, of RX 3117 and Abraxane® in combination to treat subjects with metastatic pancreatic cancer as first line therapy. Approximately 10 subjects will participate in the Stage 1 at the dose identified in Phase 1 (RP2D). Subjects will be treated for up to 8 cycles of combined therapy. An interim analysis will be conducted after 10 evaluable subjects have been treated at the RP2D, have completed a minimum of 4 cycles of therapy, or have discontinued therapy due to progressive disease before completing 4 cycles. If an adequate number of Responders are observed out of the initial 10 evaluable subjects, then 40 additional subjects will be enrolled to participate in Stage 2. Subjects will be treated for up to 8 cycles of combined therapy.
