A Study of ADRX-0706 in Select Advanced Solid Tumors
The primary purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics, and to identify the optimal dose of ADRX-0706 in patients with select advanced solid tumors.
Solid Tumors|Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC)|Urothelial Cancer|Cervical Cancer
DRUG: ADRX-0706
Incidence of adverse events, Until study completion (estimated 3 years)
Measurement of maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of ADRX-0706, Measured from pharmacokinetic (PK) blood samples, Until study completion (estimated 3 years)|Measurement of trough concentration (Ctrough) of ADRX-0706, Measured from PK blood samples, Until study completion (estimated 3 years)|Measurement of area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) of ADRX-0706, Measured from PK blood samples, Until study completion (estimated 3 years)|Measurement of terminal half-life (t1/2) of ADRX-0706, Measured from PK blood samples, Until study completion (estimated 3 years)|Measurement of systemic clearance (CL) of ADRX-0706, Measured from PK blood samples, Until study completion (estimated 3 years)|Measurement of volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) of ADRX-0706, Measured from PK blood samples, Until study completion (estimated 3 years)|Incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA), Measured from ADA blood samples, Until study completion (estimated 3 years)|Measurement of objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1, Percentage of subjects achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), Until study completion (estimated 3 years)|Measurement of duration of response (DOR), Time from first response until first evidence of disease progression (PD) or death from any cause, Until study completion (estimated 3 years)|Measurement of disease control rate (DCR), Percentage of subjects achieving CR, PR or stable disease (SD), Until study completion (estimated 3 years)|Measurement of progression free survival (PFS), Time from the start of study drug until first evidence of PD or death from any cause, Until study completion (estimated 3 years)|Measurement of overall survival (OS), Time from the start of study drug until death from any cause, Until study completion (estimated 3 years)
This is a 2 part study. The Phase 1a will consist of a dose escalation of ADRX-0706 to evaluate initial safety and tolerability in patients with select advanced solid tumors, and to identify the recommended dose to be used in the Phase 1b. The Phase 1b will further evaluate the safety and tolerability, as well as preliminary efficacy, and identify the optimal dose of ADRX-0706 in patients with urothelial cancer, triple negative breast cancer, and cervical cancer.
