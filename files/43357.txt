A Study of B-701 in Combination With Pembrolizumab in Treatment of Locally Advanced or Metastatic Urothelial Cell Carcinoma
This is a Phase 1b/2 multi-center, open-label study to establish the initial safety and to determine a recommended Phase 2 dose of B-701 in combination with pembrolizumab, and to determine safety, tolerability and efficacy of B-701 (vofatamab) plus pembrolizumab in the treatment of subjects with locally advanced or metastatic UCC, who have progressed following platinum-based chemotherapy and who have not received prior immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.
Locally Advanced or Metastatic Urothelial Cell Carcinoma|Urinary Bladder Disease|Urological Diseases
DRUG: B-701|DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities Within a Period of 35 Days, Number of Participants with Dose Limiting Toxicities within a period of 35 days will be analyzed reviewing the aggregate of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) by the B-701 program Safety Oversight Committee and will result in a recommended Phase 2 dose. Six subjects at a time are enrolled and observed for 35 days after the initial dose. If 2 or more subjects experience a DLT that dose will be declared intolerable and de-escalation of the dose will occur., 1 year|Number of Subjects Experiencing Adverse Events (AEs and SAEs), Evaluate the safety and tolerability of B-701 (vofatamab) plus pembrolizumab in subjects with UCC as assessed by number of subjects experiencing adverse events (AEs and SAEs), physical examination findings, laboratory test results, and vital signs over time. This outcome is measured by a safety monitoring committee who regularly met and reviewed aggregate trends of reports AEs, lab ranges, physical exams etc. and determined if the drug was safe to continue., 2.5 years|Efficacy of B-701 (Vofatamab) Plus Pembrolizumab Measured by ORR, Evaluate the efficacy of B-701 (vofatamab) plus pembrolizumab in subjects with UCC as measured by objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST 1.1. ORR is defined as the percentage of subjects who have baseline measurable disease and who achieve a best response of either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)., 2 years
Assessment of Changes in Biomarkers Induced by B-701 (Vofatamab), Whole blood (PBMCs), serum, and plasma samples for biomarker analyses will be obtained prior to infusion of B-701 at pre-defined visit days.

The effects of B-701 on the downstream signaling of the FGFR3 pathway, tumor sub-type and on the immune surveillance of UCC tumors will be monitored using techniques that include gene expression profiling (such as whole transcriptome RNAseq), sequencing of T-cell receptors, and immunohistochemistry., 2.5 years|Efficacy of B-701 (Vofatamab) in Combination With Pembrolizumab as Measured by DOR, Evaluate the efficacy of B-701 (vofatamab) in combination with pembrolizumab in the treatment of subjects with UCC as measured by duration of objective response (DOR), defined as the time from first occurrence of a documented, objective response until the time of relapse or death from any cause (RECIST 1.1)., 2 years|Efficacy of B-701 (Vofatamab) in Combination With Pembrolizumab as Measured by DCR, Evaluate the efficacy of B-701 in combination with pembrolizumab in the treatment of subjects with UCC as measured by disease control rate (DCR), defined as the percentage of subjects who achieve either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) according to RECIST 1.1., 2 years|Efficacy of B-701 (Vofatamab) in Combination With Pembrolizumab as Measured by PFS, Evaluate the efficacy of B-701 (vofatamab) in combination with pembrolizumab in the treatment of subjects with UCC as measured by progression-free survival (PFS), defined as the time from a first study treatment dose to first occurrence of disease progression (per RECIST 1.1) or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., 2 years|Efficacy of B-701 (Vofatamab) in Combination With Pembrolizumab as Measured by OS, Evaluate the efficacy of B-701 (vofatamab) in combination with pembrolizumab in the treatment of subjects with UCC as measured by overall survival (OS), defined as the time from first study drug administration to death from any cause (RECIST 1.1), 2.5 years|Change in Subject Reported Quality of Life, Evaluate the efficacy of B-701 (vofatamab) in combination with pembrolizumab in the treatment of subjects with UCC as measured by the change over time in subject reported quality of life as measured by the European Organization for Research and Treatment Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30)., 2 years
PK Analysis of B-701 (Vofatamab), PK will be analyzed by measuring B-701 C(trough) levels. B-701 C(trough) levels then will be summarized over time throughout the study and will be compared to predicted B-701 C(trough) levels, whose prediction is based on data observed in previous studies with B-701., 2 years|Immunogenicity of B-701 (Vofatamab), Determine the immunogenicity of B-701 as measured by anti-B-701 antibody titers at several time points throughout the study., 2 years
This is a Phase 1b/2 multi-center, open-label study to determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of B-701 (vofatamab) plus pembrolizumab in the treatment of subjects with locally advanced or metastatic UCC, who have progressed following platinum-based chemotherapy and who have not received prior immune checkpoint inhibitor or FGFR inhibitor-targeted therapy. The study consists of 2 parts: a Phase 1b lead-in phase enrolling 6 to 18 subjects and a Phase 2 dose expansion phase enrolling up to a total of 74 subjects.

Subjects who discontinue B-701 (vofatamab) may continue on study and receive pembrolizumab alone until disease progression, death, withdrawal of patient consent, or study termination. Subjects who discontinue pembrolizumab may continue on study and receive B-701 (vofatamab) alone until disease progression, death, withdrawal of patient consent, or study termination.
