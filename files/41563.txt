Oncotype DX DCIS: Impact on Radiotherapy Decision Making
Prospective single centre study of patients with DCIS that have undergone breast conservation surgery.
Breast Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: ONCOTYPE DX DCIS test
Change in radiotherapy recommendation by clinician, Percentage of clinical oncology recommendations regarding radiotherapy that change pre- and post- Oncotype DX DCIS., end of trial (2 years)
Determine whether the Oncotype DX DCIS score results in a change in patient decision for adjuvant radiotherapy., Percentage of patients who change their decision regarding radiotherapy pre- and post- Oncotype DX DCIS., end of trial (2 years)|Determine whether the local recurrence risk estimated by clinical oncologists agrees with the local recurrence risk calculated by the Oncotype DX DCIS score (for all recurrences and for invasive recurrences only)., Agreement between the local recurrence risk estimated by clinical oncologists and the local recurrence risk calculated by the Oncotype DX DCIS score (for all recurrences and for invasive recurrences only)., end of trial (2 years)|Determine change in patient decisional conflict pre and post Oncotype DX DCIS., Change in patient decisional conflict scale (DCS) scores pre and post Oncotype DX DCIS, end of trial (2 years)|Determine change in patient anxiety pre and post Oncotype DX DCIS., Change in state anxiety and trait anxiety scores using the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) pre and post ONCOTYPE DX DCIS test, end of trial (2 years)|Determine patient, tumour and clinician factors that are associated with clinicians changing their decision regarding radiotherapy., Patient, tumour and clinician factors (data collected during Visit 1) that are associated with clinicians changing their decision regarding radiotherapy., end of trial (2 years)|Determine patient, tumour and clinician related factors that are associated with patients changing their decision regarding radiotherapy., Patient, tumour and clinician related factors (data collected during Visit 1) that are associated with patients changing their decision regarding radiotherapy., end of trial (2 years)|Determine patient, tumour and clinician related factors that are associated with patients' final decision to have radiotherapy., Patient, tumour and clinician factors that are associated with patients' final decision to have radiotherapy., end of trial (2 years)
This is a single centre (Royal Marsden Hospital - Chelsea and Sutton) non-randomised trial investigating whether the Oncotype DX DCIS score changes the radiotherapy recommendation made by clinical oncologists in patients with low to moderate risk DCIS following breast conserving surgery.
