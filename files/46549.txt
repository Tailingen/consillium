Comparison of Electrodessication, Potassium Titanyl Phosphate (KTP) Laser and Pulsed Dye Laser for Treatment of Cherry Angiomata
The primary objective of this study is to determine whether laser treatments over 6 weeks using the pulsed dye laser system or the potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) laser are effective in patients with cherry angiomas as observed by a physician provider and the subject.

The investigators hypothesize that the two laser treatments will be an effective tool for treating cherry angiomas. The investigators aim to compare these modalities to electrodessication, as all three modalities are considered the current standard of care. Electrodessication can result in atrophic lesions at the site of the treated cherry angiomas.

In summary, the goal of this project is to compare the non-ablative pulsed dye laser and the AuraTM potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) laser to each other and to the current standard of care, electrodessication.
Cherry Angioma
PROCEDURE: Electrodessication|PROCEDURE: Pulsed dye laser (PDL)|PROCEDURE: potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP)
Mean Changes in Color, Texture, and Size of Cherry Angiomata From Baseline to 3 Months After the Second Treatment by Treatment Type as Assessed by Blinded Raters, Each subject received all 3 treatments. Serial standardized photographs evaluated for color,texture and size by 2 blinded dermatologists using ordinal visual analog scales from 0 to 10(color: 0=skin colored, 5=red, 10=purple; texture: 0=flat, 5=mildly elevated, 10=elevated; size: 0=0mm, 10=10 mm)., Baseline and 3 months
