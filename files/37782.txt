Impact of AferBio® on Quality of Life and Chemotherapy Toxicity in Lung Cancer Patients
The AFERBIO study will evaluates safety and potential benefit of AferBio® in patients with non-small cell lung cancer undergoing at least a second-line palliative monochemotherapy. AferBio® is a fermented supplement in powder form obtained through biotechnological processes developed in Brazil. In this double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial, participants starting a new palliative regimen will be allocated to AferBio® or placebo. The primary aim will be to compare health-related QOL scores among the arms of the study over time.
