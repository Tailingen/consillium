ASPIRIN Trial Belgium
The purpose of this study is to determine whether acetylsalicylic acid is effective on the recurrence and survival of colon cancer patients.
Colon Cancer
DRUG: acetylsalicylic acid|DRUG: Placebo
5 year overall survival, The time to an event for OS is defined as the time interval between the date of randomisation and the date of death., 5 years
Disease Free Survival, The time to an event for DFS is defined as the time interval between the date of randomisation and the date of disease recurrence or death, whichever comes first. Recurrence of a disease can be a loco-regional recurrence, a distant recurrence or a new primary colon cancer. The evidence for recurrence must be documented in the patients' file., 5 years|Time to Treatment Failure, The time elapsed between randomisation until treatment discontinuation due to disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death or any other event of interest., 5 years
The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of 80mg acetylsalicylic acid (given orally once daily for 5 years) on 5 year overall survival (OS) for stage II and III colon cancer patients of 45 years of age and older. Preclinical, epidemiologic and clinical evidence suggest that acetylsalicylic acid use may reduce overall cancer risk and mortality in colon cancer patients. It is a phase III double blind placebo controlled, randomized trial of adjuvant low-dose acetylsalicylic acid in colon cancer patients. Patients will be stratified at randomization by centre, age (\<70 and â‰¥70 years) chemotherapy use (any versus none) and disease stage.
