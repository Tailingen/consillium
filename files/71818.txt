A Phase II Trial of Induction Chemotherapy With ND-420, Cisplatin and Fluorouracil Followed by Surgery in the Treatment of Patients With Localized Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Esophagus
Investigator will assign 53 patients who had been histologically proven localized squamous cell carcinoma of esophagus to receive the induction chemotherapy regimen of ND-420 50 mg/m2 on day 1, cisplatin 70 mg/m2 on day1, plus fluorouracil 700 mg/m2 daily, day1 to day4, every 3 weeks for 2 cycles and then followed by surgical resection. The successful rate of complete treatment per protocol and complete resection will be the primary variant to evaluate in our study.
