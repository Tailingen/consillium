68Ga-FAPI-RGD PET/CT for Dual Integrin αvβ3 and FAP-targeted Imaging in Patients With Various Types of Cancer and Compared With 18F-FDG
As a new dual receptor (integrin αvβ3 and FAP) targeting PET radiotracer, 68Ga-FAPI-RGD is promising as an excellent imaging agent applicable to various cancers. In this research, we investigate the safety, biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of 68Ga-FAPI-RGD in healthy volunteers. Moreover, we evaluate the potential usefulness of 68Ga-FAPI-RGD positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) for the diagnosis of primary and metastatic lesions in various types of cancer, and compared with 18F-FDG PET/CT.
Tumor, Solid|Positron-Emission Tomography
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: 18F-FDG PET/CT, 68Ga-FAPI-RGD PET/CT
Diagnostic efficacy, The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 18F-FDG and 68Ga-FAPI-RGD PET/CT were calculated and compared to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy., 30 days
Number of lesions, The numbers of positive primary and metastatic lesions of 18F-FDG and 68Ga-FAPI-RGD PET/CT were recorded by visual interpretation., 30 days|SUV, Standardized uptake value (SUV) of 18F-FDG and 68Ga-FAPI-RGD PET/CT for each target lesion of subject or suspected primary tumor or/and metastasis., 7 days
As a new dual receptor (integrin αvβ3 and FAP) targeting PET radiotracer, 68Ga-FAPI-RGD is promising as an excellent imaging agent applicable to various cancers. In this research, we investigate the safety, biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of 68Ga-FAPI-RGD in healthy volunteers. Moreover, Subjects with various types of cancer underwent contemporaneous 68Ga-FAPI-RGD and 18F-FDG PET/CT either for an initial assessment or for recurrence detection. Tumor uptake was quantified by the maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax). The numbers of positive tumor lesions of 18F-FDG and 68Ga-FAPI-RGD PET/CT were recorded by visual interpretation. The diagnostic accuracy of 68Ga-FAPI-RGD were calculated and compared to 18F-FDG PET/CT.
