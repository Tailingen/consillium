Effect of Neoadjuvant Radiation on Tumor Infiltrating T-cells by Low Dose Radiation in Colorectal Liver Metastases
The efficiency of T cell based immunotherapies is affected by the insufficient migration and activity of tumor specific effector T cells in the tumor. Aim of this phase I/II clinical trial is to evaluate whether a neoadjuvant, low dose radiotherapy can improve T cell connected anti tumor immune response in colorectal liver metastases.

The primary endpoint is the number of tumor infiltrating T cells. Furthermore the T cell activity in situ, the number of regulatory T cells and the frequency of tumor reactive T cells in the blood and bone marrow will be examined.
Colorectal Liver Metastases
RADIATION: one time radiation|RADIATION: No Radiation
Purpose of the study is the determination of an active local external beam radiotherapy dose leading to a maximal number of tumor infiltrating T-cells. The total T-cell activity serves as primary surrogate parameters for anti- tumor activity, 2 years
To determine local control and recurrence patterns of colorectal liver metastases in a CT, 2 years|To determine the progression-free survival in patients treated with low dose photon beam radiation therapy, 2 years|• To determine the surgical morbidity in patients undergoing liver resection who received this protocol treatment, 2 years|• To determine 30-day post-operative mortality after liver resection in patients who received this protocol treatment, 2 years|• To determine the T-cell activity in the resected liver tissue, 2 years|• To determine quality of life according to the EORTC QoL questionnaire after 6 months., 6 months|To determine the number of regulatory T-cells in the resected liver tissue, 2 years|To determine the frequencies of tumor-reactive T-cells in the blood and bone marrow of the patients, 2 years|To determine quality of life according to the EORTC QoL questionnaire after 12 months., 1 year|To determine the number of patients with adverse events as a measure of safety and tolerability according to CTCAE, Version 4.0 criteria, 2 years
