Study of SHR-A1811 Combined With Pyrotinib and Bevacizumab in Advanced Breast Cancer With Brain Metastasis
In phase Ib, our study is aimed to evaluate the safety and tolerance of SHR-A1811 combined with pyrotinib in breast cancer with brain metastasis, and confirm the recommended phase 2 dose combined with preliminary results of efficacy.

In phase II, our study is aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SHR-A1811 combined with pyrotinib and bevacizumab at RP2D in breast cancer with brain metastasis.
