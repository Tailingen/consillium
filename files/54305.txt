Ibrutinib and PD-1 Blockade in High Risk Lymphocytic Leukemia
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of sequential overlapping treatment with PD-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb), pembrolizumab/MK-1375, followed by ibrutinib on endogenous immune function in previously untreated, high-risk CLL patients. Immune function will be evaluated through various laboratory correlative tests.

Overall Response Rate (ORR) to the Therapeutic Intervention, Response categories according to The International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL): Complete remission (CR); Complete remission with incomplete marrow recovery (CRi); Partial remission (PR); Progressive disease (PD); Stable disease (SD), defined as not meeting criteria for CR, CRi, PR or PD., Up to 2 years|Time to Best Response, Time to best response to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) to the therapeutic intervention., Up to 2 years
Progression-free Survival (PFS), Progressive disease (PD), defined as ≥ 50% rise in lymphocyte count to \> 5 x10\^9/L, ≥ 50% increase in lymphadenopathy, ≥ 50% increase in liver or spleen size, Richter's transformation, or new cytopenias due to CLL., Up to 2 years
