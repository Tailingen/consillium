Multicenter Evaluation in Patients With MEningiomas of the Response to Treatment With 177LUTEtium-oxodotreotide
Meningiomas are the most common primary tumors of the central nervous system, representing more than a third of tumors.Current conventional treatments for meningioma are surgery and radiotherapy. When these treatments are no longer feasible, meningiomas are considered refractory regardless of their grade. Some meningiomas express somatostatin type 2 receptors and can be treated with lutathera. This study aims to evaluate the response to treatment in this pathology

In nuclear medicine, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy with 177Lu-oxodotreotide, deploys an octreotide-like effect and appears very promising, with a preliminary progression free survival at 6 months of 94% and overall survival at 12 months of 88% in grade 1 meningiomas, and 28% with an overall survival at 12 months of 65% in grades 2 and 3 meningiomas. These results are nevertheless the result of a meta-analysis obtained from series of patients limited in number and heterogeneous in terms of type of treatment modality.

At the request of healthcare professionals and in consultation with the Advanced Accelerator Applications laboratory, the Agency of the drug security has developed a compassionate prescribing framework aimed at securing the use of Lutathera in meningiomas of all grades, expressing type 2 somatostatin in imaging of nuclear medicine, after failure of the standard treatment (surgery, radiotherapy/radio-surgery) or impossibility of carrying it out (multiple lesions, inaccessible lesions), at the suggestion of the national comitee OMEGA (April 6, 2022). This cohort has the advantage of being consistent and homogeneous in terms of type of treatment and method of administration.
