A Drug-Drug Interaction Study to Evaluate the Effect of Ripretinib on the Pharmacokinetics of a CYP2C8 Probe Substrate in Patients with Advanced GIST
Evaluate the Effect of Ripretinib on the Pharmacokinetics of a CYP2C8 Substrate
GIST - Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor
DRUG: Ripretinib|DRUG: Repaglinide
Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration for Repaglinide, Measure the Cmax, Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 1 Day 15 (pre-dose and at multiple time points [up to 24 hours] post-dose). Each cycle is 28 days.|Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from time 0 up to time t (AUC0-t) for Repaglinide, Measure the AUC0-t, Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 1 Day 15 (pre-dose and at multiple time points [up to 24 hours] post-dose). Each cycle is 28 days.|AUC from time 0 and extrapolated to infinity (AUC0-∞), Measure the AUC0-∞, Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 1 Day 15 (pre-dose and at multiple time points [up to 24 hours] post-dose). Each cycle is 28 days.
Incidence of Adverse Events, Adverse events \[TEAEs, SAEs\], dose reduction, dose interruption, or discontinuation, vital signs (heart rate \[beats/min\], and changes in laboratory parameters (chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, coagulation)., Cycle 1 through study completion (~ 12 months). Each cycle is 28 days.
