A Study of Belzutifan (MK-6482) in Combination With Palbociclib Versus Belzutifan Monotherapy in Participants With Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma (MK-6482-024/LITESPARK-024)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of belzutifan monotherapy and belzutifan plus palbociclib combination therapy in participants with advanced clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) who experienced disease progression on or after receiving prior therapy. Part 1 will establish the safety of belzutifan plus palbociclib and determine a recommended dosage of palbociclib for the combination therapy by ascending dose escalation. Part 2 will evaluate the efficacy and safety of belzutifan plus palbociclib at the dosage level determined in Part 1.
Renal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Belzutifan|DRUG: Palbociclib
Part 1 - Number of Participants Who Experience at Least One Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLT), A DLT consists of one or more of the following toxicities: Grade (Gr) 3 or 4 hypoxia or dyspnea; Gr 3 or 4 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea if persistent for \>48 hours despite therapy; Gr 3 or 4 cardiovascular, vascular, or thrombotic events; Nonhematologic AE ≥Gr 3 in severity with exceptions; Gr 3 rash that does not resolve within 2 weeks; Gr 3 nonhematologic toxicity if persisting despite optimal medical treatment; Gr 3 or 4 hematologic toxicities; Gr 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia; Gr 3 or 4 nonhematologic laboratory value; Any aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase \>8x the upper limit of normal (ULN) or 5 to 8x ULN persisting for \>2 weeks; \>2 weeks delay in dosing due to intervention-related toxicity; Intervention-related toxicity causing intervention discontinuation in the first 28 days of dosing; Missing \>20% of intervention doses due to drug-related AEs; Gr 5 toxicity. The number of participants who experience at least one DLT will be reported for Part 1., Up to approximately 28 days|Part 1 - Number of Participants Who Experience at Least One Adverse Event (AE), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. The number of participants who experience at least one AE will be reported for Part 1., Up to approximately 6 years|Part 1 - Number of Participants Who Discontinue Study Treatment Due to an AE, An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. The number of participants who discontinued from the study treatment due to an AE will be reported for Part 1., Up to approximately 6 years|Part 2 - Objective Response Rate (ORR) Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as Assessed by Investigator, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who have a complete response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a partial response (PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1. The percentage of participants who experience a CR or PR as assessed by the investigator based on RECIST 1.1 will be presented for Part 2., Up to approximately 6 years
Part 2 - Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as Assessed by Investigator, CBR is defined as the percentage of participants who have a complete response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a partial response (PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) or stable disease (SD: Neither sufficient decrease to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study) for ≥6 months per RECIST 1.1. The percentage of participants with CBR will be presented for Part 2., Up to approximately 6 years|Part 2 - Duration of Response (DOR) Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as Assessed by Investigator, For participants who demonstrate a confirmed complete response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or confirmed partial response (PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1, DOR is defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until disease progression or death. The DOR as assessed by the investigator will be presented for Part 2., Up to approximately 6 years|Part 2 - Progression-Free Survival (PFS) According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as Assessed by Investigator, PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD is defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD. PFS as assessed by the investigator will be presented for Part 2., Up to approximately 6 years|Part 2 - Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. OS will be reported for Part 2., Up to approximately 6 years|Part 2 - Number of Participants Who Experience at Least One Adverse Event (AE), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. The number of participants who experience at least one AE will be reported for Part 2., Up to approximately 6 years|Part 2 - Number of Participants Who Discontinue Study Treatment Due to an AE, An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. The number of participants who discontinued from the study treatment due to an AE will be reported for Part 2., Up to approximately 6 years
