A Study of Volociximab in Combination With Gemcitabine in Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
This clinical trial is being conducted to determine tumor response and preliminary safety of a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to a cell surface receptor (α5β1 integrin) that is required for the establishment of new blood vessels during tumor growth, a process known as angiogenesis.
