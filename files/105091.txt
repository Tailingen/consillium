Duet TRS Used in Pulmonary Resections
The objectives of this clinical trial are to estimate the incidence and duration of air leaks and the incidence of prolonged air leaks (defined as \> 5 days by the Society for Thoracic Surgery) when using the ENDO GIA Staplers with ENDO GIA Single Use Loading Units (SULUs) buttressed with Duet TRS TM in an anatomic pulmonary resection via Video Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS). Anatomic pulmonary resection is defined as either a lobectomy or segmental resection. Results of the study will be compared to contemporary literature for a similar population.
