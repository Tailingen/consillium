Breath Analysis by Ion Mobility Spectrometry
Recognition of disease specific clusters of volatile organic compounds in patients with different lung diseases, using breath analysis with ion mobility spectrometry. Lung diseases of interest are:

* COPD
* tumors
* airway infection
* interstitial lung disease
* sleep apnea Hypothesis: Breath analysis with ion mobility spectrometry can differentiate pulmonary disorders.
Lung Diseases
Identification of diseases specific VOCs, years
Change of disease specific VOCs under therapy, years
Recruitment of patients with different lung diseases goes on. First sub-group analysis of patients with COPD,lung cancer and sarcoidosis is done in order to create a training set of VOC-clusters for further validation in a bigger population of patients.
