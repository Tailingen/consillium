DRUG: AK112 low dose|DRUG: AK112 medium dose|DRUG: AK112 high dose
Safety endpoint: number of subjects with adverse events (AE), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject, temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment., Up to approximately 2 years|Primary efficacy endpoint: objective response rate (ORR), ORR is the proportion of subjects with complete response(CR) or partial response(PR) assessed according to RECIST v1.1, Up to approximately 2 years
Efficacy Endpoint assessed according to RECIST v1.1 : disease control rate (DCR), DCR based on RECIST v1.1. DCR is defined as the proportion of subjects with CR, PR, or SD., Up to approximately 2 years|Efficacy Endpoint assessed according to RECIST v1.1 : progression-free survival (PFS), PFS based on RECIST v1.1. PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization till the first documentation of disease progression assessed by the investigator or death due to any cause (whichever occurs first), Up to approximately 2 years|Efficacy Endpoint assessed according to RECIST v1.1 : Overall survival (OS), OS based on RECIST v1.1. OS is defined as the time from the date of randomization or first dosing date to death due to any cause, Up to approximately 2 years|Serum PK concentrations of AK112, Serum PK concentrations of AK112 in individual subjects at different time points after AK112 administration, Up to approximately 2 years|To evaluate the immunogenicity of AK112: Number of subjects with anti-drug antibodies (ADA), Immunogenicity of AK112: Number of subjects with detectable anti-drug antibodies (ADA), Up to approximately 2 years|To evaluate the immunogenicity of AK112: Percentage of subjects with anti-drug antibodies (ADA), Immunogenicity of AK112: Percentage of subjects with detectable anti-drug antibodies (ADA), Up to approximately 2 years|To evaluate the correlation between the expression of PD-L1 and the antitumor activity of AK112 in tumor tissues, Correlation between PD-L1 and AK112 in tumor tissues, Up to approximately 2 years|To evaluate the association between gBRCA1/2 mutation in peripheral blood and the antitumor activity of AK112 in subjects with recurrent ovarian cancer, Association between gBRCA1/2 mutation in peripheral blood and antitumor activity of AK112, Up to approximately 2 years
