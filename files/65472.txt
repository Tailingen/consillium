Osimertinib Combined With Bevacizumab in the Treatment Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Exon 20 Insertions Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
There is no muture method to treat EGFR 20 insertion mutation non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). the he purpose of this study is to study osimertinib combined with bevacizumab in the management of it.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
DRUG: Osimertinib Oral Tablet
Progression free survival, Progression-Free Survival (PFS) According to RECIST v1.1 as Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), 18 months
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve either a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as defined by BICR using RECIST v1.1 criteria., Up to 48 months|Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of participant's death due to any cause., Up to 48 months
Lung cancer is one of the most common types of cancer and is the most common cause of death from cancer (almost 20 percent \[%\] of cancer deaths); NSCLC accounts for 80% to 85% of lung cancers. The hypothesis is that osimertinib combined bevacizumab in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC characterized by EGFR Exon 20ins activating mutations. Efficacy assessments will include disease assessment, symptomatic progression and patient-reported outcome. Safety assessments will include physical examinations, vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status and clinical safety laboratory assessments (serum chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis).
