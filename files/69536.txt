Apatinib Plus Anti-PD1 Therapy for Advanced Osteosarcoma
After standard multimodal therapy, the prognosis of relapsed and unresectable high-grade osteosarcoma is dismal and unchanged over the last decades. We have already finished a prospective trial about apatinib for advanced osteosarcoma(NCT02711007) and find it has a objective response rate of aproximately 45% with median progression-free survival around 5 months. Thus, the investigators explored apatinib activity together with anti-PD1 therapy in order to induce durable response in patients with relapsed and unresectable osteosarcoma after the failure of first-line or second-line chemotherapy.

Apatinib is a small-molecule vascular endothelial growth factors receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor, similar to pazopanib, but with a binding affinity 10 times to VEGFR-2 comparing with pazopanib or sorafenib.

SHR-1210 is a humanized anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody.
Progression-free Survival|Overall Survival|Clinical Benefit Rate|Toxicity
DRUG: Apatinib|DRUG: SHR-1210
progression-free survival, Progression-free survival is defined as time from enrollment to the first occurrence of progression of disease or death from any cause within 63 days of last response assessment., up to approximately 24months|clinical benefit rate, clinical benefit rate is defined as the proportion of patients who achieve disease control (objective response and stable disease according to RECIST 1.1)., up to approximately 24months
overall survival, overall survival is defined as the duration from date of enrollment to the date of death from any cause., up to approximately 5 years
Patients more than 11 years with body surface area more than 1.2m2, progressing after standard treatment, will be eligible to receive 250 or 500 mg of apatinib once daily together with SHR-1210 3mg/kg (no more than 200mg) iv every 2 weeks until progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) at 4 months and overall survival(OS). Secondary objectives were clinical benefit rate (CBR), defined as no progression at 6 months and safety.
