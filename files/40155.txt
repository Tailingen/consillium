Comparison of Duodenoscope With Single-use Distal Cover and the Conventional Reusable Duodenoscope
The purpose of the study is to compare the success rates of procedure success and complication rates in patients undergoing Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) using two types of currently available endoscopes. These are (1) duodenoscope with a Single-use distal cover or (2) a conventional reusable duodenoscope.

Number of participants with procedure-related adverse events, Patients undergoing Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) using either of the 2 duodenoscopes will be assessed for superficial mucosal injury, perforation of the stomach or intestine, mucosal bleeding, pancreatitis, infection, death or any other symptom reported by the patient., 3 months
Duodenoscope maneuverability, Patients undergoing Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) using either of the 2 duodenoscopes will be assessed for its maneuverability during the procedure using a previously defined scoring system which uses a 5-point scale ranging from 1 to 5, with 1 being easy to perform, 2 minimal difficulty, 3 moderate difficulty, 4 severe difficulty and 5 unable to complete the requisite maneuver(1)., Maneuverability will be assessed only during the procedure (approximately 10 minutes)|Duodenoscope mechanical characteristics profile, Patients undergoing Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) using either of the 2 duodenoscopes will be assessed for their mechanical characteristics (scope stiffness, air-water button functionality, elevator efficiency and hand strain). Each characteristic will be assessed using a published 5-point scoring system., Mechanical and imaging characteristics will be assessed only during the procedure (approximately 15 minutes)|Duodenoscope imaging characteristics profile, Patients undergoing Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) using either of the 2 duodenoscopes will be assessed for their imaging characteristics (image quality and stability). Each characteristic will be assessed using a published 5-point scoring system., Mechanical and imaging characteristics will be assessed only during the procedure (approximately 15 minutes)|Ability to perform interventions, Patients undergoing Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) using either of the 2 duodenoscopes will be assessed for their ability to perform endoscopic maneuvers like sphincterotomy, balloon sweep, use of basket/mechanical lithotriptor, stone clearance, stricture dilation using balloon/catheter, stent insertion, stent removal and use of single operator cholangioscopy/pancreatoscopy. Each patient's procedure will be assessed on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 to 5, with 1 being easy to perform, 2 minimal difficulty, 3 moderate difficulty, 4 severe difficulty and 5 unable to complete the requisite maneuver., 30-60 minutes
The risks associated with the ERCP procedure will be explained to patients who meets the eligibility criteria. Consenting patients will be randomized to undergo Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) using either (1) a duodenoscope with a Single-use distal cover or (2) a conventional reusable duodenoscope. Assessments will be made during, and immediately after the procedure, then patients will be called after 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after the procedure to get information about adverse events.
