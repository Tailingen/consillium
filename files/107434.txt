Experience in Borderline Ovarian Tumors
Borderline ovarian tumors (BOTs) comprise 15-20% of primary ovarian neoplasms and represent an independent disease entity among epithelial ovarian cancers. The present study aimed to report the 8-year experience of a single center on the management and outcomes of consecutive BOTs patients. From January 2010 to December 2017, all patients with BOTs undergoing surgical treatment were included. Demographic, clinical, and pathological data were reviewed retrospectively.
