overall postoperative morbidity rates, Refers to the incidence of early postoperative complications. The early postoperative complication are defined as the event observed within 30 days after surgery., 30 days
3-year overall survival rate, 36 months|3-year disease free survival rate, 36 months|3-year recurrence pattern, Recurrence patterns are classified into five categories at the time of first diagnosis: locoregional, hematogenous, peritoneal, distant lymph node, and mixed type., 36 months|Intraoperative morbidity rates, The intraoperative postoperative morbidity rates are defined as the rates of event observed within operation., 1 day|Time to first ambulation, Time to first ambulation in hours is used to assess the postoperative recovery course., 30 days|Time to first flatus, Time to first flatus in days is used to assess the postoperative recovery course., 30 days|Time to first liquid diet, Time to first liquid diet in days is used to assess the postoperative recovery course., 30 days|Time to first soft diet, Time to first soft diet in days is used to assess the postoperative recovery course., 30 days|Duration of postoperative hospital stay, Duration of postoperative hospital stay in days is used to assess the postoperative recovery course., 30 days|Postoperative pain, Visual analog pain score method is used to evaluate the difference of postoperative pain degree.The score of postoperative pain is used to assess the postoperative recovery course., 30 days|The variation of weight, The variation of weight on postoperative 3, 6, 9 and 12 months are used to access the postoperative nutritional status and quality of life., 3, 6, 9 and 12 months|The variation of cholesterol, The variation of cholesterol in millimole/liter on postoperative 3, 6, 9 and 12 months are used to access the postoperative nutritional status and quality of life., 3, 6, 9 and 12 months|The results of endoscopy, The incidence of reflux esophagitis under the endoscopy on postoperative 3 and 12 months are used to access the postoperative quality of life., 3 and 12 months|The variation of body temperature, The daily highest body temperature in degree centigrade before discharge are recorded to access the inflammatory and immune response., 8 days|The variation of white blood cell count, The values of white blood cell count from peripheral blood before operation and on postoperative day 1, 3, 5 are recorded to access the inflammatory and immune response., Preoperative 3 days and postoperative 1, 3, and 5 days|The variation of hemoglobin, The values of hemoglobin in gram/liter from peripheral blood before operation and on postoperative day 1, 3, 5 are recorded to access the inflammatory and immune response., Preoperative 3 days and postoperative 1, 3, and 5 days|The variation of C-reactive protein, The values of C-reactive protein IN milligram/liter from peripheral blood before operation and on postoperative day 1, 3, 5 are recorded to access the inflammatory and immune response., Preoperative 3 days and postoperative 1, 3, and 5 days
The purpose of this study is to explore clinical outcomes of totally laparoscopic versus laparoscopy assisted total gastrectomy for gastric cancer.
