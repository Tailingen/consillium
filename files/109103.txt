Squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (HNSCC) rank as the sixth most common cancer globally, with approximately 575,000 new cases diagnosed each year. In recent years, there has been a rising incidence in younger patients who have limited exposure to traditional risk factors such as smoking and alcohol. This increase is closely associated with HPV infection, particularly HPV-16, which is strongly linked to oropharyngeal cancer. Treatment for HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is highly individualized, depending on the disease stage, patient comorbidities, and personal preferences. In this phase 1 study, patients with HPV-16-associated OPSCC are being treated with the immunotherapeutic delNS-vector expressing the HPV-16 oncogenes E6 and E7, administered both intratumorally and intramuscularly.
