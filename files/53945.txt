ELBA: Exemestane and Lapatinib in Advanced Breast Cancer
Aromatase inhibitors are the standard treatment for hormone responsive advanced breast cancer. The combination of the aromatase inhibitor exemestane with with another breast cancer drug that blocks epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Erb-2 activity (lapatinib) is being studied for the possibility of improving response to therapy, and delaying resistance to endocrine therapy.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: exemestane|DRUG: lapatinib
recommended dose of lapatinib given in combination with standard dose of exemestane in patients with advanced hormone-responsive breast cancer, one month after dose selection for each of 3 possible dose levels|proportion of patients free from progression, at 6 months
Treatment related toxicity, every 4 weeks|objective response, at 3 and 6 months|time to progression, at 12 months|overall survival, 18 months|prognostic role of molecular markers and circulating tumor cells, at 18 months
The recommended dose of lapatinib will be determined in the first part of the study. In the second part of the study, patients will receive the recommended dose of lapatinib and exemestane daily, taken orally.
