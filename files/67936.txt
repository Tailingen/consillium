Will Preoperative MRI Breast in Women Under 56 Years With Breast Cancer Change Primary Treatment
The study is a prospective randomised multicenter trial assessing the additional value of breast MRI in women under 56 years of age with newly diagnosed breast cancer. Will preoperative breast MRI change treatment regimen? Will preoperative breast MRI reduce the number of primary surgeries? Will preoperative breast MRI increase the rate of mastectomies? Will preoperative breast MRI be cost effective?
Breast Neoplasm
DEVICE: MRI
Change of treatment plan, Did breast magnetic resonance imaging add information about the tumour that changed primary treatment plan, 14 days
Did breast magnetic resonance imaging reduce the number of reoperation during primary management, 6 months|Did breast magnetic resonance imaging increase the number of mastectomies, 6 months|Did breast magnetic resonance imaging affect cost, 6 months
Is the sensitivity of breast MRI dependant on density and/or on age, 14 days
Completed: the study has concluded normally; participants are no longer being examined or treated (i.e., last patient's last visit has occurred)
