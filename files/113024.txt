Imetelstat Sodium in Treating Participants With Primary or Secondary Myelofibrosis
This pilot clinical trial studies how well imetelstat sodium works in treating participants with primary or secondary myelofibrosis and other myeloid malignancies. Imetelstat sodium may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate overall response rate.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of imetelstat (imetelstat sodium) in myelofibrosis (MF).

II. To evaluate the efficacy of imetelstat in the reduction of spleen size, as measured by physical examination (palpable distance from the left costal margin).

III. To evaluate the efficacy of imetelstat in improving anemia or inducing red blood cell transfusion-independence in previously transfusion-dependent participants (per International Working Group for Myelofibrosis Research and Treatment \[IWG-MRT\] criteria).

IV. To evaluate onset and durability of response as defined in primary and secondary endpoints

EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate the effect of imetelstat on bone marrow histology, karyotype and JAK2V617F allele burden II. To evaluate the effect of imetelstat on leukocytosis, circulating blast count, circulating immature myeloid cell count and thrombocytosis.

OUTLINE: Participants receive imetelstat sodium intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on day 1. Participants may continue to receive imetelstat study treatment for as long as they derive clinical benefit or until study end. The study end when all participants discontinued study drug, the last participant enrolled has been treated for approximately 5.7 years, or imetelstat is commercially available in the United States, whichever occurs first.

Maximum duration of study was approximately 5.7 years. Arm C was never initiated, and participants allocated to Arm C (Imetelstat 9.4 mg/kg \[with MF\]) were reassigned to Arms A and B.
