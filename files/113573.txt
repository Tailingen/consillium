Biomarkers Investigation of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Breast Cancer
The BINC-B trial is a diagnostic and interventional study in which various function imaging methods as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (PWI, DWI and DCE-MRI) and will be compared with common imaging methods (mammography and/or ultrasound) to investigate if an early response to a combined neoadjuvant chemotherapy in operable or potentially operable breast cancer. For breast cancer patients with positive HER-2, additional Herceptin could improve the response further. In this study the efficacy of combined neoadjuvant therapy with or without Herceptin should be evaluated and the role in predicting the tumor response with different imaging should be estimated.

pathological complete response (pCR), Rate of pathological complete response (pCR) following neoadjuvant therapy and to determine efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy in primary breast cancer using pCR (According to National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project guideline), from the first day of the the first cycle (each cycle is 14 days) of neoadjuvant chemotherapy to the date that breast and axillary sugery will be performed
Response rate, the summary of clinical complete response and partial response (RESICIST 1.1 criteria), from the first day of the the first cycle (each cycle is 14 days) of neoadjuvant chemotherapy to the date that breast and axillary sugery will be performed|Disease free survival, from the beginning of neoadjuvant chemotherapy to the confirmed time of recurrence or metastatic disease, or death due to any other cause., from the first day of the the first cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (each cycle is 14 days) to the date of first documented progression or date of death from breast cancer, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months|Overall survival, from the beginning of neoadjuvant chemotherapy to the death with any causes, from the first day of the the first cycle (each cycle is 14 days) of neoadjuvant chemotherapy to the date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months
Firstly, the investigators aim to show that the results of functional imaging including dynamic enhanced, diffuse weighted, and perfusion MR imaging biomarkers as well the ultrasonic outcome could be used to predict the response to the neoadjuvant chemotherapy for operable and potentially operable breast cancer (luminal B, HER-2 positive and triple negative).

Secondly, the investigators will study the role of peripheral blood biomarker including circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), circulating endothelial cells (CECs) and subsets, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and lymph cell subsets and their combinations could predict the response of the tumor measured with imaging.

Thirdly, the investigators will establish a mode with these multiple imaging and serum biomarker panel as well as their changes during the treatment course establish to predict the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
