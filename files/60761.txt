Stereotactic Radiosurgery in Patients With Head and Neck Region Tumours
The goal of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the stereotactic boost applied in patients with H\&N tumours.
Head and Neck Cancer
RADIATION: Stereotactic radiotherapy boost
Response to treatment, Response to treatment in imaging tests and clinical examination-local control (LC) and locoregional control (LRC)., one month after the end of treatment, every 3 months in the first year, every 4 months in the second year, and every six months in the third-fifth years
Evaluation of efficacy, Evaluation of overall survival (OS) time, 5 years after the end of treatment|Evaluation of efficacy, Evaluation of progression-free survival time (PFS), 5 years after the end of treatment|Evaluation of efficacy, Evaluation of disease-free survival time (DFS), 5 years after the end of treatment|Evaluation of safety Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)v4.0., Acute and late side effects according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v 4.0., 5 years after the end of treatment|Treatment tolerance, Evaluation of quality of live anf reatment tolerance using QLQ-C30 (Quality of Life Questionnaire C30)., an average of 3 months
Aims of the study:

1. Evaluation of the efficacy of the stereotactic boost applied in patients with head and neck tumours.
2. Evaluation of the safety of the stereotactic boost applied in patients with head and neck tumours.
3. Evaluation of the influence of the stereotactic radiotherapy boost on blood parameters reflecting tumour response (interleukin 6 (Il-6), thymidine kinase (TK), Fms-related tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt-1)), and normal tissue response (C-reactive protein (CRP)).

In the case of beneficial findings, the stereotactic radiosurgery boost in the course of radio(chemo)therapy in patients with head and neck tumours will be able to replace traditional techniques of radiation, and radical schemes of treatment will be possible for future development.
