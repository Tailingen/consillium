A Clinical Trial Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of Disitamab Vedotin Plus Tislelizumab Combined with Re-TURBT in the Treatment of HER-2-high Expression(2+-3+) Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer At High-risk and Very High-risk.
This prospective, multicenter, single-arm phase II trial aims to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of the combination therapy of Disitamab Vedotin with Tislelizumab and a second transurethral resection for the treatment of high-risk, very high-risk NMIBC with HER2 2+-3+.
NMIBC
DRUG: Distitamab Vedotin in combination with Tislelizumab
1-year Event-Free Survival rate, The possibility of patients have not experienced any events for at least 12 months after receiving treatment, including death, disease progression, switch to chemotherapy, addition of other treatments, fatal or intolerable side effects, etc, From date of randomization until the date of any event occurrence, whichever came first，assessed up to 12 months
3-years Event-Free Survival rate, The possibility of patients have not experienced any events for at least 36 months after receiving treatment, including death, disease progression, switch to chemotherapy, addition of other treatments, fatal or intolerable side effects, etc, From date of randomization until the date of any event occurrence, whichever came first，assessed up to 36 months|2-year bladder disease-free survival（2 year BIDFS） rate, The probability of patients remaining free from muscle-invasive recurrence, regional lymph node recurrence, distant metastasis, the need for radical cystectomy, or death for at least 24 months after the initiation of treatment, From date of randomization until the date of muscle-invasive recurrence, regional lymph node recurrence, distant metastasis, the need for radical cystectomy, or death, whichever came first，assessed up to 24 months|Reccurence Free Survival（ RFS）, Time from the first TURBT to the first occurrence of bladder tumor recurrence was recorded by cystoscopy and pathological examination, with the main time points being 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years, From date of the first TURBT until the date of bladder tumor recurrence, assessed up to 36 months|Overall survival, Time from the start of treatment to death from any causes, From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 60 months|Time to complete bladder resection, Time from the start of treatment to Radical cystectomy, From date of randomization until the date of radical cystectomy, assessed up to 60 months|Quality of life assessed by QLQ-C30 scale, Assessed by QLQ-C30 scale, higher scores mean better outcomes, through study completion, an average of 3 years|Adverse events, The type, incidence, relatedness, and severity of adverse events, through study completion, an average of 3 years
The specific implementation process of trial:

Patients diagnosed with high-risk and very high-risk NMIBC, based on medical history, clinical presentation, imaging examinations (such as MRI with plain and enhanced scanning), and transurethral resection for tissue pathological biopsy, are included in the "case screening process";. After excluding surgical contraindications, TURBt is performed; postoperative tissue pathological examination confirms NMIBC, and patients with immunohistochemical results of HER2 as 3+ or 2+ enter further screening. Referring to the AUA guidelines, high-risk and very high-risk NMIBC are included in subsequent analysis, where those who meet the inclusion criteria of this study, excluding the exclusion criteria, and who have recovered well after the initial TURBt and are assessed to be able to complete a second TURBt within six weeks are considered as the final candidates for enrollment.

Eligible patients for single-arm enrollment (N=40) will receive Tislelizumab (200mg) + Disitamab Vedotin (120mg for weight ≤60Kg or 2.0mg/Kg for weight ≥60Kg) the day after the initial TURBt, to be repeated every 3 weeks (Q3W). Patients are also scheduled to undergo a second TURBt within 6 weeks, and after the surgery, they will continue with three more courses of Tislelizumab + Disitamab Vedotin (Q3W) until the end of the 3-year follow-up period. The primary endpoint for evaluation in this study phase is the 1-year event-free survival (EFS), with secondary endpoints including 3-year EFS, 2-year bladder intact disease-free survival (BIDFS), time to total cystectomy, overall survival (OS), quality of life (QLQ-C30), and adverse events.
