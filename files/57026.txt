Trial of Afatinib in Pediatric Tumours
Open-label, dose escalation, monotherapy, basket trial with biomarker specific MTD expansion cohort/Phase II part.

The trial will consist of 2 parts:

1. Dose finding part to determine the MTD
2. Biomarker specific MTD expansion cohort/Phase II part to assess clinical anti-tumour activity in included tumour types
Neuroectodermal Tumors|Rhabdomyosarcoma
DRUG: afatinib
Number of Participants With Objective Response - Maximum Tolerated Dose Expansion (MTD) Cohort, Number of participants with objective response for maximum tolerated dose expansion (MTD) cohort was reported.

Number of Participants With Objective Response - Dose Finding Part, Number of participants with objective response for Dose finding part was reported. The objective response was defined as a best overall response of complete response or partial response based on investigator's assessment according to the institutional response evaluation criteria for the given tumour type, assessed every 8 weeks until progression., Assessed every 8 weeks until progression of disease, up to 336 days.|Progression Free Survival - Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) Expansion Cohort, Progression free survival for the MTD expansion cohorts was reported. Progression free survival (PFS) was defined as the duration from the date of first treatment until the date of the first documented progression or death due to any cause. If a patient did not have an event, PFS was censored at the date of last adequate tumour assessment., From the first treatment until date of first progression or death, up to 336 days.|Area Under the Concentration-time Curve of the Analyte in Plasma Over the Time Interval From 0 to 24 Hours (AUC0-24) - Dose Finding Part, Area under the concentration-time curve of the analyte in plasma over the time interval from 0 to 24 hours (AUC0-24) for Dose finding part was reported., Pre-dose before afatinib administration then 1 hour (h), 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, 5 h, 6 h, 8 h and 24 h after administration on Day 1.|Maximum Measured Concentration (Cmax) - Dose Finding Part/Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) Expansion Cohort, Maximum measured concentration (Cmax) for Dose finding part/maximum tolerated dose (MTD) expansion cohort was reported., Pre-dose before afatinib administration then 1 hour (h), 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, 5 h, 6 h, 8 h and 24 h after administration on Day 1.|Time From (Last) Dosing to the Maximum Measured Concentration (Tmax) - Dose Finding Part/Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) Expansion Cohort, Time from (last) dosing to the maximum measured concentration (tmax) for Dose finding part/maximum tolerated dose (MTD) expansion cohort was reported., Pre-dose before afatinib administration then 1 hour (h), 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, 5 h, 6 h, 8 h and 24 h after administration on Day 1.|Time From (Last) Dosing to the Maximum Measured Concentration at Steady State (Tmax,ss) - Dose Finding Part/Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) Expansion Cohort, Time from (last) dosing to the maximum measured concentration at steady state (tmax,ss) for Dose finding part/maximum tolerated dose (MTD) expansion cohort was reported., Pre-dose before afatinib administration then 1 hour (h), 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, 5 h, 6 h, 8 h and 24 h after administration at steady state on Day 8.|Accumulation (or Effective) Half-life - Dose Finding Part/Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) Expansion Cohort, Accumulation (or effective) half-life for Dose finding part/maximum tolerated dose (MTD) expansion cohort was reported., Pre-dose before afatinib administration then 1 hour (h), 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, 5 h, 6 h, 8 h and 24 h after administration at steady state on Day 8.|Duration of Objective Response - Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) Expansion Cohort, Duration of objective response in maximum tolerated dose expansion (MTD) cohort was reported. The objective response was defined as a best overall response of complete response or partial response based on investigator's assessment according to the institutional response evaluation criteria for the given tumour type, assessed every 8 weeks until progression., From first documented response until the earliest of disease progression or death, up to 336 days.|Area Under the Curve Over Dosing Interval τ at Steady State (AUCτ,ss) - Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) Expansion Cohort, Area under the curve over dosing interval τ at steady state (AUCτ,ss) in maximum tolerated dose (MTD) expansion cohort was reported., Pre-dose before afatinib administration then 1 hour (h), 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, 5 h, 6 h, 8 h and 24 h after administration at steady state on Day 8.|Maximum Measured Concentration of the Analyte in Plasma at Steady State (Cmax,ss) - Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) Expansion Cohort, Maximum measured concentration of the analyte in plasma at steady state (Cmax,ss) in maximum tolerated dose (MTD) expansion cohort was reported., Pre-dose before afatinib administration then 1 hour (h), 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, 5 h, 6 h, 8 h and 24 h after administration at steady state on Day 8.
