Augmented Reality Navigation Versus Traditional CT Guidance for Preoperative Localization of Pulmonary Nodules
This study aims to conduct a large-sample randomized controlled clinical trial, using traditional CT-guided thoracic puncture localization as a comparison, to explore the accuracy, safety and clinical advantages of Intelligent AR glasses in assisting preoperative localizing of small pulmonary nodules.
Pulmonary Nodule
PROCEDURE: AR glasses-assisted pulmonary nodule puncture localization|PROCEDURE: CT-guided pulmonary nodule puncture localization
Accuracy of puncture localization of pulmonary nodules, Quantified as the shortest distance from the actual position of the puncture needle tip to the originally planned puncture point, Intraoperative
Success rate of puncture localization of pulmonary nodules, The puncture is defined as successful when the distance between the actual localizing point of the puncture needle tip and the center of the localized nodule does not exceed 20 mm., Intraoperative|Adjust the number of needle punctures, Number of needle insertion attempts required for successful localizing, Intraoperative|Operating time, The time span from the patient's first CT scan to the last CT scan, in minutes, Intraoperative|Radiation dose, The length product value of the radiation dose recorded by the CT scanner, measured in mGy \* cm, Intraoperative
This study is an open-label prospective single-center non-inferiority randomized controlled clinical trial. Patients in the Pulmonary Hospital Affiliated to Tongji University who are scheduled to undergo percutaneous puncture localization of small pulmonary nodules are used as the research subjects. According to the entry and exit criteria Patients were included in the clinical trial, and the enrolled patients were randomly divided into the AR glasses-assisted puncture localizing group (experimental group) and the CT-guided conventional pulmonary nodule puncture localizing group (control group), aiming to evaluate the puncture of pulmonary nodules guided by Intelligent AR glasses. Non-inferiority of localization compared with conventional CT-guided pulmonary nodule puncture localization.
