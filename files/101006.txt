Clinical Validation of a Blood Biomarker Test to Detect Early-Stage Pancreatic Cancer (VERIFI)
This is a case-control study to clinically validate the performance of PancreaSure, a protein biomarker test, to differentiate Stage I and Stage II pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patient samples from samples acquired from control patients not diagnosed with PDAC but at increased risk of disease due to familial/genetic history or clinical symptoms.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: PancreaSure
PancreaSure Sensitivity, Determine the sensitivity of PancreaSure in the classification of serum samples from patients diagnosed with PDAC as positive for PDAC, in a study sample containing both PDAC and control samples., Baseline
PancreaSure Specificity, Determine specificity of PancreaSure in the classification of serum samples from control subjects as negative for PDAC, in a study sample containing both PDAC and control samples, Baseline|Performance versus CA19-9 alone, Determine performance (sensitivity and specificity) of PancreaSure compared to CA19-9 alone in the overall population, Baseline
This is the second case-control study to clinically validate the multi- analyte biomarker diagnostic model, PancreaSure. Serum samples will be collected for analysis from patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) Stages I and II and non-PDAC controls of similar demographics who were at increased risk of PDAC because of their familial or genetic history. Investigators and patients will not receive individual patient results, therefore patient care will not be impacted by test results. Analysis of blood samples will be conducted in Immunovia's laboratory in Durham, NC by personnel who are blinded to subject data. Biomarker results will be analyzed using a predefined (locked) algorithm with predefined (locked) cut-off resulting in a positive/negative test outcome.
