Study of Lurbinectedin in Combination With Doxorubicin Versus Doxorubicin Alone as First-line Treatment in Participants With Metastatic Leiomyosarcoma
The primary objective of this phase IIb/III study is to evaluate whether the combination of lurbinectedin plus doxorubicin given as first line treatment for metastatic leiomyosarcoma (LMS) prolongs the progression-free survival (PFS) by Independent Review Committee (IRC) when compared to doxorubicin administered as a single agent.
