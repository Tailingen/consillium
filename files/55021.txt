BOR: the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until CR or PR. CR: disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions and of all non-target lesions. In addition, any pathological lymph nodes assigned as target lesions/ non-target lesions must have a reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. PR: at least a 30 percent (%) decrease in the sum of diameter of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters., From the start of the treatment until disease progression (approximately up to 11 months)|Progression-free Survival (PFS) as Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 Based on Local Radiology Assessment, PFS: time from date of randomization to date of first documented PD or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first.

PD: at least a 20% increase in sum of diameter of all measured target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameter of all target lesions recorded at or after baseline. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm\^2. Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Appearance of new lesions. Participants with no PD and were still alive, were censored at last adequate tumor assessment.

RECIST 1.1, BOR was defined as the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until CR, PR or SD. CR: disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions and of all non-target lesions. In addition, any pathological lymph nodes assigned as target lesions/ non-target lesions must have a reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. PR: at least a 30 percent (%) decrease in the sum of diameter of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters.
