Zelenectide Pevedotin in NECTIN4 Amplified Advanced or Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a global, multicenter, open-label study that aims to assess the efficacy and safety of zelenectide pevedotin in participants with previously treated NECTIN4-amplified advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have received at least one line of therapy in the advanced/metastatic setting (see inclusion criteria below). The study will comprise of 2 cohorts: Cohort A (non-squamous NSCLC) and Cohort B (squamous NSCLC).
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Zelenectide pevedotin (BT8009)
Objective response rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as assessed by Investigator, Percentage of participants with either a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), Up to approximately 3 years
Number of participants reporting adverse events (AEs) and abnormalities in laboratory, electrocardiogram (ECG) and vital signs, Safety will be reported as incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v5.0 criteria., Up to approximately 3 years|Duration of Response (DOR) per RECIST v1.1 as assessed by the Investigator, DoR as measured by the time from first documentation of objective response to the first documentation of disease progression or to death (due to any cause), whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 3 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR) per RECIST v1.1 as assessed by the Investigator, Percentage of participants with confirmed CR, PR, or stable disease (SD), Up to approximately 3 years|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) per RECIST v1.1 as assessed by the Investigator, Percentage of participants with CR, PR or SD â‰¥16 weeks, Up to approximately 3 years|Progression Free Survival (PFS) per RECIST v1.1 as assessed by the Investigator, PFS is measured by the time from the first day of study drug administration (Day 1) to the first documentation of disease progression, or to death (due to any cause), whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 3 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as length of time from the first day of study drug administration (Day 1) to death (due to any cause)., Up to approximately 3 years|Time to Progression (TTP) per RECIST v1.1 as assessed by the Investigator, TTP is defined as the time from first dose of study drug administration until first documentation of disease progression, Up to approximately 3 years
