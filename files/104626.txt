Comparison of HT Concomitant With RT vs RT Alone in Patients With a Detectable PSA After Prostatectomy
The purpose of this study is to select the best therapeutic strategy in studying the effectiveness of the association of a short duration hormonal therapy and radiotherapy compared with radiotherapy alone, in patients with a detectable PSA after radical prostatectomy.
Adenocarcinoma of Prostate
DRUG: Degarelix|RADIATION: Pelvic Radiotherapy
The efficacy of the combination of hormonal therapy by degarelix and radiotherapy on event-free survival, 5 years
Survival without biological event, Biochemical recurrence was defined as a PSA \> nadir + 0.4 ng / mL confirmed by a second PSA\> nadir + 0.4 ng / mL in elevation., 5 years|Survival without clinical event, The clinical recurrence will be defined by the discovery of a local recurrence in rectal examination, the appearance of metastases by imaging or biopsy, or clinical manifestation associated with malignant disease without elevated PSA but with histological documentation or imaging., 5 years|Survival without metastases, 5 years|Overall survival, 5 years|Acute and late toxicities of the association of hormone therapy with radiotherapy, according CTC-AE v4.0, up to 5 years|Toxicities of radiotherapy, according CTC-AE v4.0, up to 5 years|Patient Quality of life, QLQ-C30, QLQ-PR25 and IPSS, up to 5 years after the end of the radiotherapy|kinetics of testosterone, up to 12 months after the end of the radiotherapy and after biological release
Study the effectiveness of the association of a short duration hormonal therapy by degarelix (Firmagon Â®) and radiotherapy, with radiotherapy alone on survival without events in the treatment of detectable PSA after radical prostatectomy.

122 patients should be included over a period of 2 years. Patients will be treated according to the following scheme:

* Arm A (61 patients) : Pelvic Radiotherapy: 46 Gy and prostate only boost up to 66 Gy
* Arm B (61 patients) : Arm A + hormonal therapy by degarelix during 6 months
