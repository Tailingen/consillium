Efficacy Study of Gemcitabine-Paclitaxel to Treat Metastatic Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the response rate to a gemcitabine-paclitaxel combination administered on a 3-weekly schedule in Chinese patients with unresectable, locally recurrent breast cancer or metastatic breast cancer.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: gemcitabine|DRUG: paclitaxel
Best Overall Tumor Response, Best response recorded from the start of treatment until disease progression/recurrence using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria that defines when participants improve ("respond"), stay the same ("stable"), or worsen ("progression") during treatment., baseline to measured progressive disease (tumor assessments were performed every 2 cycles during study therapy, or 3 months during post-therapy until disease progression, or up to 12 months after enrollment)
Time to Treatment Failure, Defined as time from enrollment to the date of death due to any cause, measured disease progression, treatment discontinuation for undocumented progression, early treatment discontinuation for toxicity or other reason, or new anticancer treatment started., baseline to stopping treatment|Progression-Free Survival, Defined as the time from enrollment to the date of objective disease progression or death on study, whichever occurs first. Censoring was determined based on US-FDA 2005 draft guidance on clinical endpoints., baseline to measured progressive disease or death (tumor assessments were performed every 2 cycles during study therapy, or 3 months during post-therapy until disease progression, or up to 12 months after enrollment)|Duration of Response, Measured from the time of first documentation of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), whichever status is first recorded, until the date of objective disease progression or death on study, whichever occurs first, with censoring defined in the same way as for progression-free survival., time of response to measured progressive disease or death (tumor assessments were performed every 2 cycles during study therapy, or 3 months during post-therapy until disease progression, or up to 12 months after enrollment)|Overall Survival Probability, Original outcome was overall survival = time from date of enrollment to date of death due to any cause. Survival time was censored at date of last contact for participants who were still alive or lost to follow-up. Because only 8 participants had documented death while on study, results are reported as 6- and 12-month overall survival probability., baseline to date of death from any cause
