The Effect of Ultrasound-guided Erector Spinae Plane Block on Postoperative Analgesia in Radiofrequency Ablation Therapy
This is a double blind, randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of ESPB(Erector Spinae Plane Block) on postoperative analgesia in RFA( Radiofrequency Ablation therapy). We will include 80 patients, and randomly assign to ESPB(Chirocaine) group and control group(normal saline).We deduce Erector spinae plane block can be use as a postoperative analgesic way for patients who receive radiofrequency ablation of hepatocellular carcinoma.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: ESPB group|DRUG: Control group
Visual analogue pain scale at postoperative day one, We will assess the pain intensity by using a 100-mm visual analogue scale at postoperative day one, approximately 12-24 hrs|Drug spread level of erector spinae plane block, We will assess the numbers of vertebral levels of erector spinae block drug spreading by using computed tomography, approximately 2-3 hrs
Visual analogue pain scale at post-anesthesia care unit, We will assess the pain intensity by using a 100-mm visual analogue scale at post-anesthesia care unit, approximately 3 hours|Postoperative recovery quality, We will assess the quality of recovery by using QoR-15 questionnaire at the postoperative day one, approximately 2 days
Computed tomography guided radiofrequency ablation of hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) has became a popular way to treat HCC. Although the wound is small and the patients can discharge on the next day, they have to suffer from moderate to severe pain. Nowadays Erector spinae plane block has been applied to many surgery as a postoperative analgesic strategy. We deduce Erector spinae plane block can be use as a postoperative analgesic way for patients who receive radiofrequency ablation of hepatocellular carcinoma. Besides, we will add contrast medium to evaluate the spread area of local anesthetics.
