A Study of Subcutaneous (SC) Pembrolizumab Coformulated With Berahyaluronidase Alfa (MK-3475A) vs Intravenous Pembrolizumab in Adult Participants With Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) (MK-3475A-D77)
This study is to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety of SC pembrolizumab (+) berahyaluronidase alfa vs intravenous (IV) pembrolizumab, administered with chemotherapy in first line treatment of adult participants with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. The primary hypotheses of this study are pembrolizumab (+) berahyaluronidase alfa subcutaneous (SC) is noninferior to pembrolizumab IV with respect to PK parameters.

Blood samples collected pre-dose and at multiple timepoints post-dose will be used to determine AUC., At designated time points (Up to ~28 months)|Maximum Serum Concentration (Cmax) of Pembrolizumab Measured at Steady State, Cmax is defined as the peak concentration over the dosing interval in steady-state. Blood samples collected pre-dose and at multiple timepoints post-dose will be used to determine Cmax, At designated time points (Up to ~28 months)|Number of Participants Who Test Positive for Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADAs) for Pembrolizumab, Blood samples are to be collected at designated time points for the determination of the presence or absence of anti-pembrolizumab antibodies. The percentage of participants who develop anti pembrolizumab antibodies will be reported., At designated time points (Up to ~28 months)|Objective Response Rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), The ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve a confirmed CR or PR per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR., Up to~60 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression per RECIST 1.1 by BICR or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to~60 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause., Up to~60 months|Duration of Response (DOR) per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), For participants who show confirmed CR or PR, DOR is defined as the time from the first documented evidence of CR or PR until disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to~60 months|Number of Participants Who Experienced at Least One Adverse Event (AE), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. The number of participants with an AE will be reported for Arms 1 and 2., Up to~28 months|Number of Participants Who Discontinued Study Treatment Due to an Adverse Event (AE), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. The number of participants who discontinue study treatment due to an AE will be reported for Arms 1 and 2., Up to~25 months|Change From Baseline in the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (QLQ-C30) Global Health Status/Quality of Life (GHS/QoL) Score-Items 29 and 30, EORTC QLQ-C30 is a psychometrically and clinically validated instrument appropriate for assessing HRQoL in oncology studies. The EORTC QLQ-C30 is the most widely used cancer-specific HRQoL instrument, which contains 30 items and measures 5 functional dimensions (physical, role, emotional, cognitive and social), 3 symptom items (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and pain), 6 single items (dyspnea, sleep disturbance, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial impact), and a global health and QoL scale. For the global health status or QoL and function scales, a higher value indicates a better level of function; for symptom scales and items, a higher value indicates increased severity of symptoms., Baseline and up to ~28 months|Change From Baseline in the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (QLQ-C30) Physical Functioning Score-Items 1 to 5, The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome and will provide data to develop health utilities for use in health economic analyses. The 5 health state dimensions in the EQ-5D-5L include the following: Mobility, Self-Care, Usual Activities, Pain/Discomfort, and Anxiety/Depression. Each dimension is rated on a 5-point scale from 1 (no problem) to 5 (unable to/extreme problems). The EQ-5D-5L also includes a graded (0 to 100) vertical visual analog scale on which the participant rates his or her general state of health at the time of the assessment. This instrument has been used extensively in cancer studies and published results from these studies support its validity and reliability., Baseline and up to ~28 months|Change From Baseline in the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (QLQ-C30) Role Functioning Score-Items 6 and 7, The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome and will provide data to develop health utilities for use in health economic analyses.
