Selinexor, Venetoclax, and Dexamethasone (XVenD) in t(11;14)-Positive Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of this research is to determine whether the combination of selinexor, venetoclax, and dexamethasone therapy can increase anti-cancer effects in patients with translocation 11;14-positive (t(11;14)), relapsed/refractory myeloma (RRMM).
Relapsed and Refractory Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Selinexor|DRUG: Venetoclax|DRUG: Dexamethasone
Fraction of Participants Achieving Overall Response, Overall response rate (ORR) will be reported as the fraction of participants achieving either complete response (CR) or partial response (ORR = CR + PR) to study treatment. Response to therapy will be assessed by treating physician using International Myeloma Working Group 2016 response criteria., Up to 3 years
Duration of Response (DoR), Duration of response is defined as the elapsed time from date of partial response (PR) or better to the date of progressive disease (PD) or death, whichever is first., Up to 3 years|Minimal Residual Disease Negative Complete Response Rate, Minimum residual disease negative (MRD negative) complete response (CR) rate will be reported as the fraction of participants achieving CR who show less than one myeloma cell per million bone marrow cells after protocol therapy. Response to therapy will be assessed using International Myeloma Working Group 2016 response criteria., Up to 3 years|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) will be defined as the time elapsed from the start of treatment to the date of documented progression or death, whichever comes first. For surviving participants without progression who begin alternative treatment, PFS will be censored at the last date of documented progression-free status prior to starting alternative treatment. Similarly, losses to follow up will be censored at the last date of documented progression-free status., Up to 3 years|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) will be defined as the time elapsed from the start of treatment until death. For surviving patients, follow-up will be censored at the date of last contact., Up to 3 years|Rate of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, Safety and tolerability of assigned protocol treatment will be reported as the rate of treatment-related toxicity, including serious adverse events (SAEs), grade 3 or higher adverse events, and all-grade adverse events (AEs), in study participants using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0, as assessed by treating physician., Up to 10 months
