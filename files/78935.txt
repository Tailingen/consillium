Multicenter Validation of the PREDICT Score
Even after adequate TME with grade III mesorectal grading, local recurrence remains a possible event. Several studies investigated different parameters and assessed their predictive power in regards to local recurrence after TME. These parameters included a variety of patient-related, tumor-related, and treatment-related factors. A recent meta-analysis reviewed the current literature for the predictors of local recurrence after TME for rectal cancer and developed a prognostic scoring system, the PREDICT score.

The present study aimed to validate the PREDICT scoring system by applying it to a prospective cohort of patients with rectal cancer who underwent curative TME in three
Rectal Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: PREDICT score
Sensitivity of PREDICT score, The ability of the score to predict actual cases of recurrence after TME, 36 months after surgery|Specificity of PREDICT score, The ability of the score to predict patients who did not experience recurrence after TME, 36 months after surgery
