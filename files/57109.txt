A Clinical Study of Boserolimab (MK-5890) With Pembrolizumab and Chemotherapy in People With Early Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (MK-5890-003)
Researchers want to learn if giving boserolimab (MK-5890) with standard treatment (pembrolizumab and chemotherapy) before surgery can help treat triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). The goals of this study are to learn about the safety of boserolimab given with standard treatment before surgery and to learn if people tolerate it and how many people have no signs of cancer in the tissues and lymph nodes removed during surgery.
Early Triple Negative Breast Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Doxorubicin (hydrochloride)|BIOLOGICAL: Boserolimab|DRUG: Epirubicin Hydrochloride|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Capecitabine|DRUG: Olaparib (if approved/available locally)
Number of participants with one or more adverse events (AEs), An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, disease, or worsening of preexisting condition temporally associated with study treatment and irrespective of causality to study treatment., Up to approximately 34 months|Number of participants who discontinue study intervention due to an AE, An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, disease, or worsening of preexisting condition temporally associated with study treatment and irrespective of causality to study treatment., Up to approximately 27 months|Pathological complete response (pCR) rate at the time of definitive surgery, pCR (ypT0/Tis ypN0) is defined as the absence of residual invasive cancer on hematoxylin and eosin evaluation of the complete resected breast specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes after completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy per current American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging criteria assessed by the local pathologist at the time of definitive surgery., Up to approximately 9 months
pCR-no ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) rate at the time of definitive surgery, pCR-no ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) (ypT0 ypN0) is defined as the absence of residual invasive and in situ cancer on hematoxylin and eosin evaluation of the complete resected breast specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes after completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy per current AJCC staging criteria assessed by the local pathologist at the time of definitive surgery., Up to approximately 9 months|Event-Free Survival (EFS), EFS is defined as the time from randomization to disease progression that precludes surgery, local or distant recurrence, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 72 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause., Up to approximately 72 months
The umbrella design of this study provides the framework to evaluate the safety, tolerability and clinical activity of different investigational agents in participants with newly diagnosed, high-risk, early-stage TNBC who might benefit from adding these investigational agents to pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy.
