Palliative Radiotherapy for Symptomatic Locally Advanced Gastric Cancer: A Phase II Trial
The hypothesis of this study is that a radiotherapy dose of 36Gy in 12 fractions, which equates to a BED of 48.6Gy, increases the response rates of symptom relief compared to historical controls.
Gastric Cancer
RADIATION: Palliative Radiotherapy
Response of bleeding to radiotherapy, Percentage of patients who do not require blood transfusion after radiotherapy, At the 12th fraction of radiotherapy and at one month post radiotherapy
Number of patients who develop anorexia, nausea, vomiting as per common toxicity criteria v3.0, Toxicity, within the first 14 days from start of radiotherapy
The hypothesis of this study is that a radiotherapy dose of 36Gy in 12 fractions, which equates to a BED of 48.6Gy, increases the response rates of symptom relief compared to historical controls. (Tey et al.) With this dose fractionation is used for bleeding, there is an increase in response rates from 55%(historical) to 75%for pain, there is an increase in response rates from 25% (historical) to 45% for obstruction, there is an increase in response rates from 25% (historical) to 45%
