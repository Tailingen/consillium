Zoledronic Acid in Decrease the Lung Metastatic Rate of Osteosarcoma
Zoledronic acid is an adjuvant treatment for primary osteosarcoma. Zoledronic acid has been widely used in the treatment of metastatic bone tumors. In addition to its inhibition of tumor osteoclasis, it also produces certain killing of tumor cells. effect. Foreign studies have shown that zoledronic acid also has a killing effect on osteosarcoma and has a certain inhibitory effect on distant metastasis. We hope that it can reduce tumor recurrence and lung metastasis through this study.
