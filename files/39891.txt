A Study of CC-90002 in Subjects With Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and High-risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)
Study CC-90002-AML-001 is an open-label, Phase 1 dose escalation (Part A) and expansion (Part B), clinical study of CC-90002, administered by intravenous (IV) infusion, in subjects with relapsed and/or primary refractory AML and high-risk MDS. The study will explore escalating doses of CC-90002 using a 3 + 3 dose escalation design in Part A, followed by dose expansion in Part B.

The primary objective is to determine the safety and tolerability of CC-90002 and also to define the non-tolerated dose (NTD), the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of CC-90002.
Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute|Myelodysplastic Syndromes
DRUG: CC-90002
Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLT), Number of participants with a DLT, Up to 26 months|Non-tolerated Dose (NTD), The NTD is defined as the dose at which 2 or more of up to 6 evaluable subjects in a cohort experience a DLT in Cycle 1, Up to 26 months|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), The MTD is defined as the last dose level(s) below the NTD with 0 or 1 out of 6 evaluable subjects experiencing a DLT during Cycle 1., Up to 26 months
Preliminary Efficacy of CC-90002, Determined by response rates of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) by disease-appropriate response criteria., Up to 35 months|Pharmacokinetics-Cmax, Maximum observed concentration in serum, Up to 35 months|Pharmacokinetics-AUC, Area under the serum concentration - time curve, Up to 35 months|Pharmacokinetics-Tmax, Time to peak (maximum) serum concentration, Up to 35 months|Pharmacokinetics-T 1/2, Terminal half-life (T 1/2), Up to 35 months|Pharmacokinetics- CL, Total body clearance of the drug from the serum, Up to 35 months|Pharmacokinetics- Vss, Volume of distribution at steady-state, Up to 35 months|Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADAs), Determine the presence and frequency of anti-drug antibodies, Up to 35 months
In both Part A and Part B, treatments will be administered in two phases starting with an induction phase followed by a maintenance phase. During the induction phase, treatments will be administered in 42-day cycles in Cycles 1 through 4. Following completion of Cycle 4 in the induction phase, subjects with non-progressive disease will enter the maintenance phase. During the maintenance phase, treatments will be administered in 28 day cycles. Subjects may continue CC-90002 for up to a maximum of 2 years (eg, induction phase Cycles 1 through 4 and maintenance phase Cycles 5 through 24) or until clinically significant disease progression, the occurrence of intolerable toxicity, or physician/subject decision to discontinue CC-90002, whichever comes first.
