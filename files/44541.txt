A Safety and Efficacy Study of TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9 in the Treatment of HPV-related Cervical Intraepithelial NeoplasiaⅠ
This is an open-label and triple cohort study of the safety and efficacy of TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9 to possibly treat HPV Persistency and human cervical intraepithelial neoplasiaⅠwithout invasion.
Human Papillomavirus-Related Malignant Neoplasm
BIOLOGICAL: TALEN|BIOLOGICAL: CRISPR/Cas9
Number of participants with Adverse Events, The primary objective of this Study is to evaluate the safety of therapeutic doses and the dosing regimen of TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9 plasmid., 6 months
Change of HPV16 or 18 DNA titers, Blood samples will be taken at the baseline, months 3 and 6 on each subject., Baseline, 3 and 6 months|Change of cervical cytological results., ThinPrep Pap Test will be conducted at the baseline, months 3 and 6 on each subject., Baseline, 3 and 6 months|Change of cervical histological results., Colposcopy Biopsy will be conducted at the baseline and month 6 on each subject., Baseline and 6 months.
HPV persistent infection is the major causal factor of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical cancer. The important roles of E6 and E7 playing in HPV-driven carcinogenesis make them attractive targets for therapeutic interventions. Previous evidences showed that using designated TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9 as genome editing tool could produce disruption of HPV16 and HPV18 E6/E7 DNA, significantly decreasing the expression of E6/E7, inducing cell apoptosis and inhibiting cell lines growth.

This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of TALEN-HPV E6/E7 and CRISPR/Cas9-HPV E6/E7 in treating HPV Persistency and HPV-related Cervical Intraepithelial NeoplasiaⅠ
