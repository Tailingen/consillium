A Clinical Research of CD33-Targeted CAR-T in Myeloid Malignancies
The overall purpose of this study is to explore the therapeutic effect of CD33-targeted chimeric antigen receptor T(CAR-T) cells in the treatment of Myeloid Malignancies.
Myeloid Malignancies
BIOLOGICAL: Anti-CD33-CAR-transduced T cells
Adverse Events That Are Related to Treatment, Determine the toxicity profile of the CD33 targeted CAR T cells with Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects (CTCAE) version 4.0., 3 years
In vivo existence of Anti-CD33 CAR-T cells, 3 years|Reaction Rate of Treatment, 3 years
Great progress has been made in the treatment of relapsed and refractory B cell malignancies with CD19-targeted CAR-T cells. However, for myeloid malignancies, which has higher morbidity, trials of CAR-T is few. CD33 is expressed on most myeloid leukemia cells so it is a ideal target for CAR-T. This trial is designed and conducted to test the safety and effectiveness of CD33-targeted CAR-T.
