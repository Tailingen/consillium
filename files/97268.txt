Radiomic Assessment in NSCLC: Correlation Between Multiparametric Imaging Biomarkers and Genetic Biomarkers
The purpose of this study is to evaluate relationships between multiparametric imaging biomarkers and genetic analysis in NSCLC patients.
Lung Cancer
Functional and genomic profiling of lung cancer, Prognostic stratification will be evaluated using following parameters:

1. Quantitative and qualitative parameters from CT, PET, MRI
2. Genomic data of lung cancer samples, five years
Relationship between genomic and multiparametric imaging profiling, We will evaluate if certain relationship exists between changes in multiparametric imaging markers from CT, PET, MRI and genomic informations of NSCLC., five years|Precise prediction of pulmonary function such as ventilation and perfusion after the lung resection., following parameters exracted from whole lung will be evaluated: Quantitative parameters related to pulmonary function from CT, PET, MRI 2. Prediction of longitudinal changes of pulmonary function after the lung resection, five years
To evaluate relationships between multiparametric imaging biomarkers(CT, PET/CT, MRI) and genetic analysis in NSCLC patients
