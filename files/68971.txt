Feasibility Study of Cavity Radiofrequency Ablation in ex Vivo Mastectomy Breast Tissue
The purpose of this study is to build a device that will consistently ablate (destroy or remove) cavitary breast tissue after a formal breast cancer resection in order to mimic the tissue that is now irradiated after breast cancer lumpectomy. The device would be easier to handle, perform the ablation in less time and by so ablating this margin would avoid the need in many for reoperation to obtain negative margins and based on preliminary data avoid the need for radiation. This would be especially important in poor and rural patients and would lead to decreased costs of treatment in patients with favorable breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
DEVICE: RFA Applicator
Ablation Depth, Ablation depth is the extent to which tissue has been completely desiccated from the wall of the cavity. It will be assessed by pathologic analysis using H\&, PCNA, and Ki67 stains. The ablation depth of each slide processed is to be the smallest distance of completely necrotic tissue., One year
