Safety and Efficacy of Obatoclax Mesylate (GX15-070MS)in Combination With Docetaxel for the Treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
Defects in the apoptotic process can lead to the onset of cancer by allowing cells to grow unchecked when an oncogneic signal is present. Obatoclax is designed to restore apoptosis through inhibition of the Bcl-2 family of proteins, thereby reinstating the natural process of cell death that is often inhibited in cancer cells.

This is a multi-center, open-label, Phase I/II study of obatoclax administered in combination with docetaxel in 3-week cycles to patients with relapsed or refractory Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer. Treatment may be administered on an outpatient basis. No investigation or commercial agents or therapies other than those described herein may be administered with the intent to treat the patient's malignancy. Supportive care measures including those directed at controlling symptoms resulting from Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer are allowed.
