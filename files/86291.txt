ExAblate Blood-Brain Barrier Disruption for Glioblastoma in Patients Undergoing Standard Chemotherapy
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of the ExAblate Model 4000 Type 2.0 used as a tool to disrupt the BBB in patients with Glioblastoma undergoing standard of care therapy.
Glioblastoma Multiforme
DEVICE: BBB Disruption with Chemotherapy Arm
Adverse Events Safety Profile, The type and severity of adverse events post-procedure will be assessed for overall safety. Safety of the BBBD procedure will be evaluated through patient examination and MRI assessments during the treatment and by their standard of care follow-up MRI scans and clinical visits. The standard of care follow-up MRI scans will be used to continue safety monitoring post-BBBD procedures and after adjuvant TMZ chemotherapy is completed., 7 months
Blood Brain Barrier Opening, The ability to open the Blood Brain Barrier with ExAblate Focused Ultrasound will be evaluated by contrast MR imaging. If the procedure was successful, the area treated with show contrast enhancement on MRI., 7 months
This is a prospective, multisingle-center, single-arm study to establish the safety and feasibility of BBB disruption along the periphery of tumor resection cavity using the ExAblate Neuro Model 4000 Type 2.0 (220 kHz) system. For this study, patients will be eligible to enroll in the study prior to beginning the planned adjuvant TMZ chemotherapy phase of treatment. Of note, only patients who are deemed eligible for adjuvant TMZ will be eligible for enrollment. This study will enroll up to 20 subjects.
