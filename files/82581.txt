A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of BGB-16673 Compared to Pirtobrutinib in Adults With Relapsed/Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia or Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BGB-16673 alone compared with pirtobrutinib in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) who had been previously treated with a covalent Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor (cBTKi).
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma
DRUG: BGB-16673|DRUG: Pirtobrutinib
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) per Independent Review Committee (IRC), PFS is defined as time from the date of randomization to the date of first disease progression or death, whichever occurs first, as determined by IRC using modified 2018 International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (iwCLL) criteria for participants with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and Lugano classification for participants with small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL)., Up to approximately 3 years
Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause., Up to approximately 3 years|PFS per Investigator (INV), PFS per INV is defined as time from the date of randomization to the date of first disease progression or death, whichever occurs first, as determined by investigator using modified 2018 International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (iwCLL) criteria for participants with CLL and Lugano classification for participants with SLL., Up to approximately 3 years|Overall Response Rate (ORR) per IRC and INV, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of complete response, complete response with incomplete bone marrow recovery, nodular partial remission, or partial response, as assessed by the investigator and IRC using modified 2018 iwCLL criteria for patients with CLL and Lugano classification for patients with SLL., Up to approximately 3 years|Rate of Partial Response with Lymphocytosis (PR-L) or Higher per IRC and INV, The rate of PR-L or higher is defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of complete response, complete response with incomplete bone marrow recovery, nodular partial remission, partial response, or PR-L., Up to approximately 3 years|Duration of Response (DOR) per IRC and INV, DOR is defined as the time from initial response to disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 3 years|Time to Next Anti-CLL/SLL Treatment (TTNT), TTNT is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of next anti-CLL/SLL treatment., Up to approximately 3 years|Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs), Number of participants with treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), including laboratory abnormalities., Up to approximately 3 years|Change from Baseline in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire EORTC IL409, EORTC IL409 consists of a set of 19 questions derived from the EORTC quality of life questionnaire core 30 (QLQ-C30) and its CLL module CLL17. The EORTC IL409 includes questions on global health status (GHS)/quality of life, physical functioning, role functioning, physical condition/fatigue, and symptom burden.Higher scores in GHS and functional scales and lower scores in symptom scales indicate better health-related quality of life., Baseline and up to approximately 3 years
