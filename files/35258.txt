SURVEILLE-HPV: Evaluation of HPV16 Circulating DNA as Biomarker to Detect the Recurrence, in Order to Improve Post Therapeutic Surveillance of HPV16-driven Oropharyngeal Cancers
SURVEILLE-HPV - A new post therapeutic surveillance strategy for HPV-driven oropharyngeal cancer based on HPV Circulating DNA measures.

HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer patients have a much better prognosis that their HPV-negative counterparts. Despite this, Post Treatment Surveillance (PTS) strategy does not take into account HPV status.

HPV Circulating DNA (HPV Ct DNA) has emerged as a promising tool to assess the risk of cancer recurrence following treatment. We assume that this biomarker could be helpful to guide PTS.

The number of systematic PTS visits could be significantly reduced in patients with undetectable HPV Ct DNA whereas a closer clinical and radiological follow up could be performed in case of detectable HPV Ct DNA.

If confirmed, this new strategy could have several benefits including:

* reduction of PTS visits for most HPV-positive patients which implies a potential cost decrease and
* Identification of relapse at early stages (before the occurrence of symptoms)
Oropharynx Squamous Cell Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: HPV16 Ct-DNA dosing
Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of HPV16 ct-DNA, The presence of HPV16 ct-DNA will be evaluated by ddPCR. NPV will be defined as 2 successive HPV16 ct-DNA negative results., 24 months
5- year Negative Predictive Value, The presence of HPV16 ct-DNA will be evaluated by ddPCR. NPV will be defined as 2 successive HPV16 ct-DNA negative results., 48 and 60 months|Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of HPV16 ct-DNA, The presence of HPV16 ct-DNA will be evaluated by ddPCR. PPV will be defined as 2 successive HPV16 ct-DNA positive results., 18, 24, 48, and 60 months|Rate of relapses detected by HPV16 ct-DNA, The proportion of patients with relapse detected by HPV16 ct-DNA without any other symptoms., 5.5 years|Disease-free survival, Disease-free survival (DFS) is defined as the delay between date of inclusion and tumor relapse (local, regional, or distant) or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., 5.5 years|Loco-Regional recurrence, Evaluation of the stage of the first loco-regional event detected by medical imaging. The stage will be defined by the size of the tumor and the number of invaded lymph nodes., From randomization to disease recurrence, up to 5.5 years|Time of distant recurrence, The length of time until manifestation of the first metastatic event detected by medical imaging., From randomization to disease recurrence, up to 5.5 years|Overall survival, The overall survival is the length of time from randomization that patients enrolled in the study are still alive., From randomization to death from any cause, up to 5.5 years|Cost-effectiveness analysis of the proposed strategy, To evaluate the economic cost of the lightened surveillance as compared to the standard treatment in terms of cost assessments and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio., 5.5 years
