ERAP1,2 in Recalcitrant Warts
The exact mechanisms underlying the contribution of cellular immunity in the eradication of human papillomavirus (HPV) infections remain obscure. Individuals who have treatment-resistant warts frequently have immune deficiencies. Amino-peptidases (ERAP1, ERAP2) of endoplasmic reticulum are essential for production of antigenic epitopes that attach to the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I and activate T-lymphocytes or natural killer (NK) cells. Aim: To assess ERAP1 and ERAP2 serum concentrations in patients with resistant warts.
