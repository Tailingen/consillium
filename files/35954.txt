TAK-228 Plus Tamoxifen in Patients With ER-Positive, HER2-negative Breast Cancer
This is an open label phase II clinical trial to determine the efficacy, toxicity, and safety of TAK-228 plus tamoxifen in patients with newly diagnosed ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer.
Estrogen Receptor Positive Breast Cancer
DRUG: TAK-228|DRUG: Tamoxifen
Ki67 Expression, Ki67 expression change from baseline to 6 weeks, Baseline to 6 weeks
Number of Participants Meeting Certain Preoperative Endocrine Prognostic Index (PEPI), Evaluate the number of participants meeting certain PEPI score after treatment with TAK-228 plus tamoxifen.

PEPI score of 0 indicates low risk of disease recurrence (better outcome) PEPI score of 1-3 indicates intermediate risk of of disease recurrence (worse outcome) PEPI score of \>4 indicates high risk of of disease recurrence (worst outcome), 16 weeks|Number of Participants With Pathological Complete Response (pCR), Pathologic complete response was defined as the absence of residual invasive cancer on hematoxylin and eosin evaluation of the complete resected breast specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes following completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy (i.e., ypT0 ypN0 or ypTis ypN0 in the current American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system)., 16 weeks
Plasma Concentrations of TAK-228 Plus Tamoxifen, Measure plasma concentrations of TAK-228 plus tamoxifen over time, 16 weeks|Correlation Between Change in Ki67 Expression and pCR to TAK-228 Plus Tamoxifen, Assess the correlation between change in Ki67 expression and pCR to TAK-228 plus tamoxifen, 16 weeks|Correlation Between Tumor Mutational Status and Response to TAK-228 Plus Tamoxifen, Assess correlation between tumor mutational status and response to TAK-228 plus tamoxifen, 16 weeks|Correlation Between Change in mTOR Expression and pCR to TAK-228 Plus Tamoxifen, Assess the correlation between change in mTOR expression and pCR to TAK-228 plus tamoxifen, 16 weeks
The mTOR pathway is commonly dysregulated in ER-positive breast cancers and represents a key resistance mechanism to endocrine therapy such as tamoxifen. We plan to target the mTOR pathway with mTORC1/2 inhibitor TAK-228 to overcome tamoxifen resistance in early-stage ER-positive breast cancer. An open label phase II clinical trial will be conducted to determine the efficacy, toxicity, and safety of TAK-228 plus tamoxifen in patients with newly diagnosed ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. TAK-228 (30 mg weekly) plus tamoxifen (20 mg daily) will be administered for 16 weeks. Patients will undergo tumor biopsy before starting the study treatment and after 6 weeks of study treatment. Blood samples for pharmacokinetics analysis will be obtained 1 hour before and after TAK-228 dosing on days 1 and 15 of the study.
