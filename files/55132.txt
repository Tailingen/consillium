Increased Frequency of AlloStim(TM) Dosing in Combination With Cryoablation in Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients
This phase I/II study is designed to compare different treatment schedules of a personalized anti-cancer vaccine protocol which combines the cryoablation of a selected metastatic lesion with intra-tumor immunotherapy. The cryoablation causes the tumor to release tumor-specific antigens into the surrounding environment. The injection of bioengineered allogeneic immune cells, AlloStim(TM), into the lesion is designed to modulate the immune response and educate the immune system to kill other tumor cells.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: AlloStim|PROCEDURE: Cryoablation
To determine the safety of increased frequency of dosing, Three patients are enrolled at each frequency schedule in the absence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT). A DLT is defined as any allergic or autoimmune toxicity or other study drug related toxicity Grade 3 or higher during the DLT assessment window., Window is defined as the time required receiving two doses of AlloStim IV push plus 28 days follow-up
Health-Related Quality of Life, Health-Related Quality of life will be measured using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) and its supplementary breast cancer questionnaire (QLQ-BR23)., From enrollment to 90 days after last dose administration.|Evaluate the anti-tumor effect of Allostim combined with cryoablation at the new proposed dose and frequency schedule., Each treatment schedule will be monitored for radiological, pathological, and immunological response. These assessments will be compared between three treatment schedules., 90 days after last dose administration
Immunological Response, Blood samples will be evaluated for immunological response and a determination made as to whether immunological response correlates with RECIST and pathology., 90 days after last dose administration|Anti-Tumor Response, The changes in tumor burden by RECIST and compare these changes with the pathological analysis of corresponding biopsies., 90 days after last dose administration
The study will assess three different dosing schedules. A standard 3 plus 3 study design will be used. The starting dose for each dosing schedule will be escalated in subsequent groups of patients. The study will evaluate safety of increased frequency of AlloStim (TM) dosing and anti-tumor effect of the new proposed dose and frequency schedule.
