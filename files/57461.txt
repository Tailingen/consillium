Surveillance Pelvic Examination Anxiety: Brief Coping Skills Intervention
The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility and acceptability of a brief coping skills training program addressing anxiety and pain related to surveillance pelvic examinations for female gynecologic cancer survivors.

Intervention acceptability will be assessed using an adapted version of the Satisfaction with Therapy and Therapist Scale (STTS-R), The adapted STTS-R consists of 18 items that assess satisfaction with the therapist and the intervention on a 5-point Likert-type scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree)., post pelvic examination (approximately 2-3 months after baseline)|Change in intervention acceptability will be assessed using an adapted version of the Satisfaction with Therapy and Therapist Scale (STTS-R), Change in intervention acceptability from immediately after completion of the 3 sessions (post intervention assessment) to after trying to implement the coping skills during their next pelvic examination (post pelvic exam assessment), using the STTS-R. The adapted STTS-R consists of 18 items that assess satisfaction with the therapist and the intervention on a 5-point Likert-type scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree)., post-intervention (within 2 weeks of their next pelvic examination), post pelvic examination (approximately 2-3 months after baseline)|Intervention feasibility as measured by percentage of recruited participants who enrolled, Enrollment logs will capture the number of participants who were recruited and among them, the number that enrolled in the study., post pelvic examination (approximately 2-3 months after baseline)|Intervention feasibility as measured by attrition, Retention logs will capture the number of participants who did not complete the study protocol (rate of attrition), post pelvic examination (approximately 2-3 months after baseline)|Intervention feasibility as measured by survey completion, Retention logs will capture the number of participants who completed all assessments, post pelvic examination (approximately 2-3 months after baseline)|Intervention feasibility as measured by home practice completion, Interventionist logs completed at the conclusion of each session will capture the level of home practice completion, post-intervention (within 2 weeks of their next pelvic examination)|Intervention feasibility as measured by participant engagement, Interventionist logs completed at the conclusion of each session will capture the level of participant engagement with a 1 item question rated from 1 (not at all engaged) to 4 (highly engaged)., post-intervention (within 2 weeks of their next pelvic examination)|Intervention feasibility as measured by interventionist fidelity, Fidelity rating forms will be used to measure the level of fidelity to session content for one third of the sessions for the protocol. Each component of the session will be rated from 0 (not covered at all) to 3 (thoroughly covered the topic), post-intervention (within 2 weeks of their next pelvic examination)
Change in anxiety related to examination as measured by the The State Anxiety Scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, The State Anxiety Scale of the STAI is comprised of 20 items on a 5-point Likert scale, which range from 1 (not at all) through 4 (very much)., baseline, post-intervention (within 2 weeks of their next pelvic examination), post pelvic examination (approximately 2-3 months after baseline)|Change in pain during examination as measured by numeric scales, Numeric scales will be used to assess the average pain during examination, worst pain during examination, and lowest pain during examination, ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as you could imagine). The three pain intensity ratings will be averaged to create a total score for pain., baseline, post pelvic examination (approximately 2-3 months after baseline)
The investigators have developed and manualized a coping skills training intervention for female gynecologic cancer patients that aims to reduce anxiety related to surveillance pelvic examinations (Pelvic Examination and Anxiety Coping Skills for Empowerment: PEACE). The investigators propose a proof-of concept pilot study to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of the coping skills intervention. The study will be conducted by Duke University. Participants (N=16) will receive the 3-session telemedicine coping skills intervention. Participants will complete assessments at baseline, post-intervention (within 2 weeks before their next scheduled pelvic examination), and post pelvic examination (2-3 months after the baseline assessment). Study aims are: Aim 1) Assess intervention acceptability and feasibility through quantitative measurement and qualitative feedback from semi-structured interviews, and Aim 2) Graphically depict patterns of change in outcome variables and intervention targets.
