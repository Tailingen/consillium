Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of mRNA-4157 Alone and in Combination in Participants With Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of mRNA-4157 alone and in combination in participants with solid tumors.
Solid Tumors
BIOLOGICAL: mRNA-4157|BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab|BIOLOGICAL: SoC Treatment
Number of Participants with Adverse Events, Part A and A2: Baseline through 100 days after last mRNA-4157 dose; Parts B, C, D, E1, E2, and E3: Baseline through 90 days after last pembrolizumab dose
Part C: Overall Response Rate (ORR): Number of Participants with Tumor Response (Partial or Complete), ORR is defined as the proportion of participants whose best overall response is complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)., Baseline through disease progression by Response Evaluation Criteria of Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), start of new anti-cancer therapy, withdrawal of consent, death and last safety follow-up visit (up to approximately 3 years)|Part C: Duration of Response (DoR), DoR is defined as time from first tumor response (partial or complete) until either radiological disease progression, clinical/symptomatic disease progression or death (whichever is sooner)., Baseline through disease progression by RECIST 1.1, start of new anti-cancer therapy, withdrawal of consent, death and last safety follow-up visit (up to approximately 3 years)|Part C: Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as time between the date of first dose of pembrolizumab and the date of either radiological disease progression, clinical/symptomatic disease progression or death (whichever is sooner)., Baseline through disease progression by RECIST 1.1, start of new anti-cancer therapy, withdrawal of consent, death and last safety follow-up visit (up to approximately 3 years)|Part C: Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as time between the date of the first dose of study drug and the date of death due to any cause., Baseline to death of any cause (up to approximately 3 years)|Part A2: Recurrence-free Survival (RFS), RFS is defined as the time between the date of first dose of mRNA-4157 and the date of one of the following events: radiological disease relapse, clinical/symptomatic disease progression as assessed by the investigator or death due to any cause., Baseline up to 2 years|Parts A2, E1, E2, and E3: Number of Participants with Presence or Absence of Circulating Tumor DNA (ctDNA), Presence or absence of ctDNA prior to start of treatment as well as across longitudinal study timepoints, and association with RFS., Baseline up to 2 years|Parts E1 and E2: Event-free Survival (EFS), EFS is defined as the time from date of the first dose of study drug to the first of the following events: radiographic disease progression, local progression precluding surgery, inability to resect the tumor, local, regional, or distant recurrence, or death due to any cause and will be determined either by biopsy assessed by local pathologist or by investigator-assessed imaging using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1., Baseline up to 2 years|Part E3: EFS, EFS, based on RECIST 1.1, is defined as the time from date of the first dose of study drug to the first of the following events: radiographic disease progression per RECIST 1.1; local, regional or distant recurrence as assessed by computed tomography scan or biopsy if indicated (for participants who are disease free after surgery); clinical progression as evidenced by peritoneal carcinomatosis confirmed by preoperative laparoscopy or laparotomy (for participants who are confirmed to be free of peritoneal involvement by laparoscopy at screening); or death due to any cause., Baseline up to 2 years
This is a multi-part, dose-escalation study of mRNA-4157 monotherapy in participants with resected solid tumors (Part A), mRNA-4157 monotherapy lead-in and then in combination with standard of care (SoC) adjuvant chemotherapy followed by mRNA-4157 monotherapy in participants with resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) (Part A2), mRNA-4157 in combination with pembrolizumab in participants with both unresectable (locally advanced or metastatic) solid tumors (Parts B and C) and adjuvant resected cutaneous melanoma (Part D), and mRNA-4157 in combination with pembrolizumab and SoC chemotherapy in peri-operative setting in participants with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Part E1), squamous cell NSCLC (Part E2), and gastric/ gastroesophageal (GEJ) cancer (Part E3). Parts A and B will include a dose escalation phase of the study to identify doses of mRNA-4157 for the expansion phase of the study. Doses of mRNA-4157 will be administered to participants in a dose escalation regimen. Participants in Parts A2, B, C, D, E1, E2 and E3 dose expansion phase will receive mRNA-4157 at a recommended dose for expansion.
