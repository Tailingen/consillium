A Study of HLX10 in Combination With Carboplatin Plus (+) Pemetrexed With or Without HLX04 Compared With Carboplatin+Pemetrexed in 1L Advanced Non-Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
This study involves a two-part design. Part 1 is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the 4 drug (HLX10+HLX04+carboplatin+pemetrexed). Part 2 is a randomized, open-label study, which will evaluate the safety and efficacy of HLX10 in combination with carboplatin+pemetrexed with or without HLX04(biosimilar of avastin) compared with treatment with carboplatin+pemetrexed in 1st line Stage IIIB/IIIC or IV non-squamous NSCLC. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to Arm A (HLX10+HLX04+Carboplatin+Pemetrexed), Arm B (HLX10+HLX04 placebo+Carboplatin+Pemetrexed), or Arm C (HLX10 placebo + HLX04 placebo+Carboplatin+Pemetrexed).
