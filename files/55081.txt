Influence of Acid Reflux on Stromal Epithelial Interaction in Barrett's Esophagus
The purpose of this study is to determine the association between acid reflux and cell changes in Barrett's esophagus.

Specific aim 1: To test the hypothesis that controlled acid reflux is associated with lesser degree of stromal activation.

Specific aim 2: To test the hypothesis that stromal fibroblast derived growth factors drive BE epithelial proliferation.
Barrett's Esophagus
PROCEDURE: 24 hour pH study and upper endoscopy (EGD)
activated myofibroblasts, The primary end point for the study will be the proportion of patients with activated myofibroblasts (defined as positive staining for SMA and vimentin with negative staining for Desmin, in \> 50% of subepithelial myofibroblasts). This primary end point will be compared between the group with controlled acid reflux and the group without acid reflux., 6 months
