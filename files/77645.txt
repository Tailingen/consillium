Kidney Function and Risk Factors in Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) Undergoing 177Lutetium-PSMA Radioligand Therapy: a Prospective Observational Study - KiRi-Trial
The goal of this observational study is to determine the impact of 177Lutetium-Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) Radioligand Therapy (177Lu-PSMA-RLT) on kidney function over time. The main question it aims to answer is:

What is the absolute decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in patients undergoing 177Lu-PSMA-RLT after 12 and 24 months?

Patients treated with 177Lu-PSMA-RLT will have their kidney function monitored before, during, and after therapy using routine markers like creatinine and cystatin C. Additional biomarkers and urine proteomics will be collected to identify early detection markers and risk factors for chronic kidney disease (CKD). Follow-up examinations will be conducted at regular intervals up to 5 years. The study also aims to correlate clinical risk factors and patient-reported outcomes with kidney insufficiency to assess the impact of therapy and identify vulnerable patient groups.

Patients with mCRPC treated at Klinikum rechts der Isar who are newly receiving therapy with 177Lu-PSMA-RLT will be included. To ensure data quality, standard operating procedures (SOPs) will be implemented for both technical measurements and data collection. Data entered into the registry will undergo double data verification against predefined rules for range and consistency with other data fields. This ensures the accuracy and reliability of the collected data. A detailed data dictionary will be maintained, describing each variable used in the registry, including its source, coding information (e.g., TNM staging system), and normal ranges if relevant. Patient reported outcomes (PROM) of cancer related symptoms and quality of life will be collected using standardized questionnaires.

Based on the power calculation, a total of 100 patients will be included in the study. These patients will be followed up for a period of up to 5 years to ensure comprehensive data collection and analysis.
