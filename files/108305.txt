Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Liver Metastases
RATIONALE: Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue.

PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of radiation therapy in treating patients with liver metastases.
Metastatic Cancer
RADIATION: radiation therapy
To determine the maximally tolerated dose, From start of treatment to 90 days
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine the maximum tolerated dose of high dose per fraction, highly conformal radiotherapy in patients with liver metastases.

Secondary

* Determine the failure patterns and survival of patients treated with this regimen.
* Correlate dose-volume characteristics with possible toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.
* Determine the local control rate within irradiated fields in patients treated with this regimen.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study.

Patients undergo highly conformal radiotherapy (HCR) to the liver once daily, 5 days a week, for 2 weeks.

Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of HCR until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 3 years.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18 patients will be accrued for this study.
