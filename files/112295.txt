Study of Nilotinib as First Line Treatment in Philadelphia Chromosome Positive(Ph+) Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia in Chronic Phase (CML-CP)
The study was a local multicentric, open-label, non-randomized phase II study of nilotinib as a first line treatment in adult patients with newly-diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) and chronic phase myeloid leukemia (CML-CP).
Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia
DRUG: Nilotinib
Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Major Molecular Response (MMR) During the First 12 Months, Major Molecular Response (MMR) was defined as BCR-ABL1\^IS ≤0.1%, on the International Scale \[BCR-ABL1IS\]) by 12 months. BCR is the Breakpoint Cluster Region gene / BCR gene product and ABL is the Abelson proto-oncogene. BCR-ABL is the Fusion gene from BCR and ABL/Protein product from BCR-ABL. Participants who withdrew prematurely or those who failed to provide data for the study for other reasons were designated as premature withdrawal or inevaluable, respectively, and were included in the ITT analysis as non-responders., 12 months
Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Major Molecular Response (MMR) up to 24 Months, Major Molecular Response (MMR) was defined as BCR-ABL1\^IS ≤0.1%, on the International Scale \[BCR-ABL1IS\]) by 12 months. BCR is the Breakpoint Cluster Region gene / BCR gene product and ABL is the Abelson proto-oncogene. BCR-ABL is the Fusion gene from BCR and ABL/Protein product from BCR-ABL. Participants who withdrew prematurely or those who failed to provide data for the study for other reasons were designated as premature withdrawal or inevaluable, respectively, and were included in the ITT analysis as non-responders., 3, 6, 9, 15, 18, 21 and 24 months|Percentage of Participants With Complete Cytogenetic Response (CCyR) at Month 6 and 12, CCyR rate is identified as the rate of patients who had 0% of Ph+ metaphase., Month 6 and 12|Percentage of Participants With Complete Hematologic Response (CHR) at Month 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24, A confirmed complete hematological response (CHR) is defined when all of the following criteria are achieved: WBC \<10 x 109/L, thrombocyte \<450 x 109/L, myelocyte + metamyelocyte \<%5 in blood, no sign of blast and promyelocyte in blood, basophil \<%5, and no sign of extramedullary involvement., Month 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24|Time to Major Molecular Response (MMR), Time to MMR is defined as the time period from the date of first dose intake until the first documented MMR., 24 months|Duration of Major Molecular Response (MMR), MMR duration is defined as the time from the date of first documented MMR to the first time of the lost MMR, progression or death., 24 months
This was a multicenter, open-label, single-arm, phase 2 study of nilotinib as a frontline treatment for patients with Ph+ CMLCP. All patients received oral nilotinib 300 mg twice daily for a planned treatment duration of 24 months or until early discontinuation.

The primary efficacy end point was the cumulative rate of Major Molecular Response (MMR) in all participants by 12 months. Secondary efficacy end points included the rate of Complete Cytogenic Response (CCyR) at 6 and 12 months; cumulative rates of MMR up to 24 months; time to and durability of MMR; and cumulative rate of Complete Haematologic Response (CHR) by 12 months.

Patient evaluations, including hematologic assessments, were conducted every 15 days during the first 3 months, monthly until month 12, and then every 3 months until the end of the study (24 months). All efficacy analyses were performed in the intent-to treat population.
