A Study to Investigate the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Clinical Activity of AP203 in Patients with Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors, and Expansion to Selected Malignancies
This is a multi-regional, multi center, open label, first in human (FIH), dose-escalation, and dose-expansion study of AP203 to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor activities of AP203 in adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors|Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)|Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC)|Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (ESCC)
DRUG: AP203|DRUG: AP203
Dose-Escalation: Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), DLT is defined as toxicity (adverse event \[AE\] at least possibly related to AP203) occurring during the DLT evaluation period, The initial 28 days and completion of the first 4 doses of treatment|Both Dose-Escalation and Dose-Expansion: Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious AEs, Safety assessed using incidence, nature, and severity of AEs and SAEs, At screening (≤ 28 days before the first dose of AP203), up to 90 days after the last dose|Dose-Expansion: Overall response rate(ORR) (assessed by the Investigator according to RECIST version 1.1), ORR is defined as the proportion of participants with CR or PR, At screening (≤ 28 days before the first dose of AP203, up to 90 days after the last dose
