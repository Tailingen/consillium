Nimotuzumab Combined With Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy for Locally Advanced Treatment Esophageal Cancer in Old Age
The research subjects of this project are mainly aimed at patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer who cannot be treated surgically, in Taixinsheng 3 months after the end of concurrent chemoradiotherapy, RECIST is pressed as based on physical examination and esophageal barium dialysis or esophageal contrast-enhanced CT Criteria assessed short-term and long-term efficacy separately. By detecting the expression of EGFR in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer, the relationship between the efficacy of EGFR monoclonal antibody therapy and the long-term prognosis of patients was evaluated. Evaluation of safety, toxicity and side effects during treatment and in the near and long term.
Esophageal Carcinoma
DRUG: Nimotuzumab|DRUG: Tigio|RADIATION: Concurrent radiation therapy
Overall Survival, Overall survival was measured from the initiation of chemotherapy to the date of the last follow-up or death., up to 3 years
complete response，CR, After treatment, the lesion completely disappears, or all symptoms and signs of the unmeasurable lesion completely disappear, and the lesion completely disappears in X-ray and bone imaging examinations for bone metastasis, lasting for at least 4 weeks, through study completion, an average of 18 month|partial response，PR, The sum of the maximum diameters of the target lesion decreases by more than 30% and lasts for more than 4 weeks., through study completion, an average of 18 month|no response，NR, At the end of radiotherapy, there is residual tumor or no significant improvement in the lesion, but there are still significant filling defects and worsening of niche or stenosis, through study completion, an average of 18 month|Toxic side reactions, The US Toxicity Evaluation Standard (CTC3. O) is divided into O\~4 grades, and the evaluation of acute radiation reactions adopts RTOG/EROTC criteria, through study completion, an average of 18 month
It is expected that 45 patients will be enrolled, and patients who meet the enrollment criteria will undergo esophagoscopy, esophageal barium meal examination, chest contrast-enhanced CT, abdominal ultrasound, electrocardiogram, blood routine, whole body bone scan, liver and kidney function and other examinations before treatment, and esophageal ultrasound if necessary. Patients who received esophageal ultrasound were staged by esophageal ultrasound results, and those without esophageal ultrasound were mainly staged according to the cervical chest and epigastric contrast CT and esophageal barium plates, and clinical staging was performed according to the 2002 AJCC staging standard. After the combination of Taixinsheng and concurrent chemoradiotherapy, adverse reactions and efficacy evaluation were observed. The expected result is that the local control rate of EGFR monoclonal antibody combined with chemoradiotherapy is improved in patients with locally advanced elderly esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and there is no significant increase in adverse reactions, and serological indicators such as EGFR can be used as prognostic indicators for esophageal malignancy and have certain guiding significance for treatment. EGFR monoclonal antibody can be used in locally advanced elderly esophageal cancer patients who cannot tolerate chemotherapy, with good short-term efficacy and tolerable toxic side effects, which further provides reference value for clinical guidance.
