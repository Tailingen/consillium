Ensartinib as Adjuvant Treatment in Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) Positive Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, Phase III study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ensatinib compared with placebo as adjuvant treatment in ALK positive stage II-IIIB non-small cell lung cancer after surgical resection with or without chemotherapy.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Ensartinib|DRUG: Placebo
Disease free survival (DFS), From date of randomization until date of tumor recurrence or death, whichever occurs earlier, up to 5 years
DFS rate at 3 years, Assessed at 3 years|DFS rate at 5 years, Assessed at 5 years|Overall survival (OS), Assessed at 5 years|OS rate at 5 years, up to 5 years
This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, Phase III study, the primary endpoint is disease-free survival. Participants in the experimental arm will receive Ensatinib at 225 mg orally once a day taken with or without food for 2 years. Participants in the control arm will receive placebo at 225 mg orally once a day taken with or without food for 2 years. Treatments will continue until disease recurrence, meeting one of treatment discontinuation criteria (eg, patient decision, adverse event, pregnancy), or achieving a maximum treatment duration of 2 years, whichever occurs earlier. At the time of treatment discontinuation, participants will enter a survival follow-up until death, withdrawal of consent or study closure, whichever occurs earlier.
