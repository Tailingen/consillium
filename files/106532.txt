A Phase II Study of UCN-01 in Metastatic Melanoma
UCN-01 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth. This phase II trial is studying how well UCN-01 works in treating patients with metastatic melanoma.
Recurrent Melanoma|Stage IV Melanoma
DRUG: 7-hydroxystaurosporine|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis|OTHER: pharmacological study
Response Rate, Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR, Up to 7 years
Overall Survival, Estimated using the product-limit method of Kaplan and Meier., Up to 7 years|Progression-free Survival, Estimated using the product-limit method of Kaplan and Meier.

Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., From the date of study registration to the first documentation of progressive tumor, assessed up to 7 years
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To assess the anti-tumor activity of UCN-01 (7-hydroxystaurosporine) in metastatic melanoma, as determined by the response rate.

II. To assess the clinical and laboratory toxicities of UCN-01. III. To study the effects of UCN-01 administration on potential markers of specific G1-phase cell cycle regulators.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive UCN-01 IV over 3 hours on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients are followed for survival.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 17-33 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.
