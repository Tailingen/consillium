Presurgical Therapy With Lapatinib to Explore Molecular Determinants of Response to EGFR/erbB2 Targeted Therapy
The purpose of this study is to see what kinds of breast tumors will respond to lapatinib. Lapatinib is an experimental medicine which may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
