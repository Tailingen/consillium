Computer-based Skin Aging Simulation for Skin Cancer Prevention
This pilot study is to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding skin cancer prevention in young adults and to determine the impact of artificial intelligence-based simulation of facial skin aging on their attitudes regarding skin cancer prevention.
Skin Aging
OTHER: artificial intelligence-based skin aging simulation|OTHER: electronic questionnaire 1|OTHER: electronic questionnaire 2
Change in visual analogue scale (VAS) score regarding importance of UV- protection, Change in VAS score regarding importance of UV- protection (0 = not important; 10 = extremly important), before and after the skin aging simulation (each scoring session will take about 15-20 minutes)|Change in VAS score regarding rating of personal exposure to UV radiation, Change in VAS score regarding rating of personal exposure to UV radiation (0 = no exposure; 10 = very high exposure), before and after the skin aging simulation (each scoring session will take about 15-20 minutes)
Questionnaire asking for reduction of UV- exposure (yes/no), Questionnaire asking for reduction of UV- exposure (yes/no), after the skin aging simulation (each scoring session will take about 15-20 minutes)|Questionnaire asking for intensification of UV protection measures (yes/ no), Questionnaire asking for intensification of UV protection measures (yes/ no), after the skin aging simulation (each scoring session will take about 15-20 minutes)
In young adulthood an increasing UV-exposure often starts because of the belief that tanning increases attractiveness\]. Raising awareness and educating students and adults regarding practices for skin cancer prevention are critical since skin cancer is increasing rapidly worldwide. Skin cancer preventive interventions for adolescents are needed to improve their motivation for sun safety behavior. This pilot study is to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding skin cancer prevention in young adults and to determine the impact of artificial intelligence-based simulation of facial skin aging on their attitudes regarding skin cancer prevention.
