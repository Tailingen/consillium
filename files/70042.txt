Toripalimab Therapy After Resection in High-risk Stage IA2-IB NSCLC With no Driver Alterations (EGFR or ALK)
This is a prospective, open, single-center, single-arm phase II clinical study in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without common EGFR-sensitive mutations (Ex19del and L858R) or ALK fusion variants identified in the central laboratory. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of adjuvant Toripalimab therapy in completely resected stage IA2-IB non-squamous NSCLC with high-risk factors.

3-year DFS rate, DFS is defined as time from randomization to disease recurrence (determined by CT or MRI scan and/or pathologic disease on biopsy) or death (from any cause) by investigator assessment. 3-year DFS rate is Disease-Free Survival at 3 Years., From date of randomisation up to approximately 5 years
