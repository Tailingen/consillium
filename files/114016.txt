A Study to Evaluate Lanraplenib (LANRA) in Combination With Gilteritinib in Participants With FLT3-mutated Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of lanraplenib (LANRA) in combination with the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) inhibitor gilteritinib, in participants with relapsed or refractory (R/R) FLT3-mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
Acute Myeloid Leukemia|Relapsed Acute Myeloid Leukemia|Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Lanraplenib|DRUG: Gilteritinib
Number of Participants Who Experienced a Treatment-emergent Adverse Event (TEAE), A TEAE was any unfavorable or unintended sign, symptom, laboratory abnormality or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether considered causally related to the study drug or not that started after the first dose of the earliest study drug through the lesser of non-protocol anti-leukemic therapy initiation or end of treatment visit.

A serious TEAE was defined as any TEAE that:

* Resulted in death.
* Was life-threatening.
* Required or prolonged a pre-existing hospitalization.
* Resulted in disability/incapacity.
* Was a congenital anomaly/birth defect.
* Was considered a significant medical event by the investigator.

TEAEs were graded for severity based on the National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 5.0 as follows:

* Grade 1 - Mild.
* Grade 2 - Moderate.
* Grade 3 - Severe.
* Grade 4 - Life-threatening.
* Grade 5 - Death related to adverse event (AE)., Cycle 1 Day 1 (each cycle was 28 days) to 30 days after last dose of either LANRA or gilteritinib or initiation of non-protocol antileukemic therapy, whichever was earlier (maximum duration of treatment was 183 days)|Number of Participants Who Experienced a Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLT) for LANRA, A DLT was defined as any of the following occurring within the DLT assessment period:

* A nonhematologic toxicity of Grade ≥ 3 that was at least possibly related to LANRA (with noted exceptions).
* Any toxicity that resulted in administration of \< 80% of the cumulative, Cycle 1 dose for either LANRA or gilteritinib.
* Grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia lasting \> 28 days after treatment onset that was not attributed to active acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and was at least possibly related to LANRA.
* Any toxicity that resulted in reduction in the dose of LANRA in Cycle 1.

DLTs were graded for severity based on the NCI-CTCAE version 5.0 as follows:

* Grade 3 - Severe.
* Grade 4 - Life-threatening., Cycle 1 Day 1 to pre-dose Cycle 2 Day 1 (each cycle was 28 days)|Maximally Tolerated Dose (MTD)/Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of LANRA in Combination With Standard Doses of Gilteritinib, The MTD/RP2D was defined as the highest dose with either 0 of 3 or no more than 1 of 6 patients with LANRA-related DLTs.
