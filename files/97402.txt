A Study on the Combination of Sintilimab, Ramucirumab and Chemotherapy for First-line Treatment of Gastric Cancer With Liver Metastasis
The goal of this clinical trial is to observe the efficacy and safety of Sintilimab (a PD-1 inhibitor) combined with Ramucirumab (a VEGFR-2 antagonist) and chemotherapy as a first-line treatment for patients with advanced gastric cancer with liver metastasis.

* Can the combination of Sintilimab, Ramucirumab, and chemotherapy improve the prognosis of patients with AGC and liver metastases?
* What are the adverse events (AEs) associated with the use of the combination regimen of Sintilimab, Ramucirumab, and chemotherapy in patients with AGC and liver metastases?

Participants will:

* Receive a combined treatment regimen of Sintilimab, Ramucirumab, and chemotherapy (SOX (oxaliplatin and S-1) or XELOX (oxaliplatin and capecitabine)), administered every 21 days for up to 6 cycles. Following the completion of 6 cycles, maintenance therapy with Sintilimab and oral chemotherapy agents (capecitabine or S-1) with or without Ramucirumab will be administered until disease progression.
* Imaging assessments will be performed at baseline, after every 2 cycles of treatment, and every 3 months following the completion of 6 cycles of treatment.
Stomach Neoplasms
DRUG: Sintilimab|DRUG: Ramucirumab|DRUG: SOX/XELOX
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the proportion of participants whose tumor volume decreases to a predefined value and can maintain the minimum duration requirements, which is the sum of the rates of Complete Response (CR) and Partial Response (PR) according to RECIST 1.1 based on investigator assessment., Up to approximately 12 months
Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR was defined as the percentage of the participants who achieve either a response (PR + CR) or Stable Disease (SD) after treatment and can maintain the minimum duration requirements according to RECIST 1.1 based on investigator assessment., Up to approximately 12 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from the start of treatment to disease progression according to RECIST 1.1 based on investigator assessment, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 16 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from enrollment to death due to any cause., Up to approximately 16 months|Incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events (AEs), Categorized according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (CTCAE 5.0). Descriptive statistical analysis is primarily used to list and describe the AEs that occurred during this trial., Up to approximately 16 months
