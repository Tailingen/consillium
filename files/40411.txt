CPI-613 (Devimistat) in Combination With Chemoradiation in Patients With Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
This is a single-center, open-label, phase I study designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and safety profile of CPI-613® when used concomitantly with chemoradiation for local control of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC).
Pancreas Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: CPI-613® (Dose level -1.0 250 mg/m^2)|DRUG: CPI-613® (Dose level 1.0 500 mg/m^2)|DRUG: CPI-613® (Dose level 2.0 1,000 mg/m^2)|DRUG: CPI-613® (Dose level 3.0 1,500 mg/m^2)|DRUG: CPI-613® Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)|DRUG: Gemcitabine|RADIATION: Intensity-modulated Radiation Therapy
Maximum Tolerated Dose of CPI-613®, MTD will be determined by testing increasing doses of CPI-613®, starting from 500 mg/m\^2 and up to 1,500 mg/m\^2, on dose escalation cohorts of three patients (maximum 24 patients) in combination with Gem-RT therapy. MTD reflects the highest drug dose that does not cause unacceptable adverse effects., Initiation of treatment to 30 days after treatment
The number of subjects with adverse events related to the treatment, All adverse events will be documented using the NCI CTCAE version 5.0 criteria., Start of study treatment until 30 days after completion of study treatment.
This study is designed to test the hypothesis that a combination of gemcitabine and radiation therapy (Gem-RT) with CPI-613®, a selective mitochondrial metabolism inhibitor in PDAC tumor cells, will be well tolerated without additional significant toxicity. Additionally, CPI-613® is expected to improve the Gem-RT effectiveness, resulting in durable local control of disease. As a necessary and initial step to translate preclinical observations into a patient setting and test our proposed hypotheses, the investigators will perform a dose-finding phase I clinical trial that has been designed to evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended phase II dose (RP2D), and safety profile of CPI-613® along with standard of care Gem-RT in patients with unresectable PDAC in need of definitive local control of disease. The overarching goals for this trial are to determine the safety and toxicity of CPI-613® when given concurrently with Gem-RT.
