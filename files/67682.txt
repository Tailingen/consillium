Dose Escalation of Icotinib in Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC) Patients Evaluated as Stable Disease
The primary purposes of this study are to assess the safety and efficacy of using high doses of the drug Icotinib (Conmana) as a way to treat patients with non-small cell lung cancer that achieve stable disease after 8 weeks routine therapy.
NSCLC
DRUG: Icotinib of routine dose|DRUG: Icotinib of high dose
Progression Free Survival, A duration from randomization date to disease progression(as defined by RECIST) or death. If a participant are known to have progressed, the time to progression is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of progression. Otherwise, a participant will be censored at the last date they are known not to be progressed., 6 months
Overall survival, Overall Survival is assessed via calculation of the time to death due to any cause. If a participant is known to have died, the time to death is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death. Otherwise, a participant will be censored at the last date they are known to be alive., 15 months|Transformation rate from stable disease to complete response or partial response, Number of participants with an stable disease previously achieve complete response or partial response after dose escalation. Either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) will be evaluated by RECIST, confirmed at least 28 days following the date of the initial response., 6 weeks|Incidence rate of adverse events, Number of patients with a adverse event, identified according to the Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) in evaluable-for-safety population, which included all patients who received at least 1 dose of study medication., 40 months
This is a multi-center phase II randomized controlled study to assess the safety and efficacy of using high doses of the drug Icotinib (Conmana) as a way to treat patients with non-small cell lung cancer that achieve stable disease after 8 weeks routine therapy by PFS, as well as OS and DCR. The adverse events and adverse reaction are evaluated as well.
