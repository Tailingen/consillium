MT-601 Administered To Patients With Locally Advanced Unresectable or Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
The goal of this clinical trial is to assess safety and tolerability of escalating doses of MT-601 administered during the off week of chemotherapy regimen for patients with pancreatic cancer. The main question\[s\] it aims to answer are: safety and efficacy • overall response rate and duration of response. Participants will meet all applicable inclusion criteria prior to chemotherapy and must agree to provide apheresis material.
Pancreas Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: MT-601
During Dose Escalation - assess the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of MT-601 administered during the off week of chemotherapy regimen., * Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs)
* Safety (including but not limited to): treatment-emergent adverse events, SAEs, deaths, and clinical laboratory abnormalities per NCI CTCAE, Version 5.0, Through study completion. Approximately 3 years|During Dose Expansion - estimate overall response rate (ORR) of MT-601, To estimate overall response rate (ORR) of MT-601 administered during the off week of chemotherapy regimen (RECIST v1.1) ORR to be measured by disease assessments conducted prior to treatment, at baseline, 8 weeks, 16 weeks and during active follow-up visits which will occur every 8 weeks (starting from Week 24), using RECIST v1.1, Through study completion. Approximately 3 years|During Dose Expansion - estimate duration of response (DOR) of MT-601, To estimate duration of response (DOR)of MT-601 administered during the off week of chemotherapy regimen (RECIST v1.1) DRR to be measured by disease assessments conducted prior to treatment, at baseline, 8 weeks, 16 weeks and during active follow-up visits which will occur every 8 weeks (starting from Week 24), using RECIST v1.1, Through study completion. Approximately 3 years
During Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion - determine the Efficacy of MT-601, To assess anti-tumor activity of MT-601 administered during the off week of chemotherapy regimen based on RECIST v1.1 and overall survival (OS)

* ORR and DOR
* Disease control rate (DCR), time to response (TTR), PFS
* OS, Through study completion. Approximately 3 years|During Dose Expansion - assess safety and tolerability of MT-601, To assess safety and tolerability of MT-601 administered during the off week of chemotherapy regimen

-Safety (including but not limited to): TEAEs, SAEs, deaths, and clinical laboratory abnormalities per NCI CTCAE Version 5.0, Through study completion. Approximately 3 years
Exploratory: During Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion - examine the expansion, persistence, clonality and anti-tumor immune effects of the adoptively transferred, autologous MT-601, as well as the presence of epitope spreading in all groups, * Explore markers of immune function, cell targeting, signaling pathways and disease status
* Examine ORR, DOR, DCR, TTR, and PFS based on iRECIST, Through study completion. Approximately 3 years|Exploratory: During Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion - assess anti-tumor activity of MT-601 administered during the off week of chemotherapy regimen based on iRECIST, * Explore markers of immune function, cell targeting, signaling pathways and disease status

The Dose Escalation portions will proceed using a standard 3+3 design. Flat doses of MT-601 will be administered ranging from 200 million cells to 400 million cells. For the Dose Expansion, MT-601 will be administered at the dose determined to be safe based on the results from the Dose Escalation portion. Front-line chemotherapy (FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel) will be administered as per standard of care. MT-601 will be administered intravenously over 10 minutes (± 5 minutes) during the "off" week of front-line chemotherapy. Patients will receive up to 6 infusions of MT-601 approximately every 4 weeks.
