Single-incision Versus Conventional Laparoscopic Surgery for Colorectal Cancer
This study is designed to evaluate the short-term and long-term results after single incision laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer（SILSC） compared with conventional laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer（CLSC）.

In order to improve cosmetic effect and reduce postoperative pain, single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) is attracting increasing attention. SILS is considered to be the next major advance in the progress of minimally invasive surgical approaches to colorectal disease that is more feasible in generalized use. In most previous studies, SILS for colorectal cancer was feasible and short-term safe compared to conventional laparoscopic surgery (CLS) . However, there is still controversy over its potential better cosmetic effect and less postoperative pain. Moreover, the long-term oncologic outcomes are still inconclusive as only a few studies showed long-term survival data. Up to now, most studies were limited to their retrospective nature and small samples. So more studies, especially large-scale, randomized controlled trials are needed to establish the best indications for SILS for colorectal cancer.
