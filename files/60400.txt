MGD019 DART® Protein in Unresectable/Metastatic Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) pharmacodynamics and preliminary antitumor activity of lorigerlimab.

This Phase 1, open-label study will characterize safety, dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), and maximum tolerated/administered dose (MTD/MAD) of MGD019. Dose escalation will occur in a 3+3+3 design in patients with advanced solid tumors of any histology. Once the MTD/MAD is determined, a Cohort Expansion Phase will be enrolled to further characterize safety and initial anti-tumor activity in patients with specific tumor types anticipated to be sensitive to dual checkpoint blockade.

BIOLOGICAL: Lorigerlimab
Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events, Safety is based on evaluation of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) from the time of study drug administration through the End of Study visit., 30 days after last dose
Cmax, Maximum Plasma Concentration of lorigerlimab, up to 108 weeks|Tmax, Time to reach maximum (peak) plasma concentration of lorigerlimab, up to 108 weeks|AUC, Area Under the Plasma Concentration versus Time Curve of lorigerlimab, up to 108 weeks|Ctrough, Trough plasma concentration of lorigerlimab, up to 108 weeks|CL, Total body clearance of the drug from plasma of lorigerlimab, up to 108 weeks|Vss, Apparent volume of distribution at steady state of lorigerlimab, up to 108 weeks|t1/2, Terminal half life of lorigerlimab, up to 108 weeks|Percent of patients with anti-drug antibodies against lorigerlimab, Immunogenicity, up to 108 weeks|Objective response rate (ORR), The number of participants who have a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) to treatment. Efficacy assessed using conventional Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), Every 12 weeks, up to 4 years|Duration of Response (DoR), DoR is defined as the time from the date of initial response (CR or PR) to the date of first documented PD or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, Every 12 weeks until withdrawal of consent, lost to follow up, death, or end of the study, up to 4 years|Progression free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the first dose date to the date of first documented PD or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Tumor status assessed every 12 weeks. Survival status is assessed approximately every 12 weeks after the last dose of study treatment until withdrawal of consent, lost to follow up, death, or end of the study, up to 4 years|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the first dose date to the date of death from any cause., OS status is assessed approximately every 12 weeks after the last dose of study treatment until withdrawal of consent, lost to follow up, death, or end of the study, up to 4 years|Prostate specific antigen (PSA) response rate in mCRPC, Percent of patients with 50% or more decline in PSA and confirmed 3 weeks later, Every 3 weeks on treatment, then every 3 months up to 2 years post last treatment|Best PSA percent change in mCRPC, Best percent change in PSA from baseline, Every 3 weeks on treatment, then every 3 months up to 2 years post last treatment|Duration of PSA response, Time from PSA response to time of PSA progression, Every 3 weeks on treatment, then every 3 months up to 2 years post last treatment|Radiographic progression-free survival (PFS) in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), Time from first dose to first occurrence of radiographic progression, or death, up to 2 years post last treatment|Time to PSA progression in mCRPC, The time from the first dose of MGD019 to the first documented PSA progression. PSA progression is defined as an increase that is ≥ 25% and ≥ 2 ng/mL the baseline or lowest value observed, and which confirmed by a second value at least 3 weeks later, PSA is assessed every 3 weeks while on treatment, every 3 months for up to 2 years post-treatment
