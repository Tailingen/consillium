Study of LUCAR-20S in Patients With R/R NHL
An open label, single arm Phase I study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of LUCAR-20S CAR-T cells in relapsed or refractory CD20+ diffuse large B-cell, follicular, mantle cell and small lymphocytic lymphoma.

This study is an open, dose escalation/dose regimen finding study to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of donor-derived CD20-directed CAR-T cells administered with lymphodepletion, and to obtain the preliminary efficacy results in subjects who have been diagnosed with relapsed or refractory CD20 positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma or small lymphocytic lymphoma. The allo-CAR-T cells will be infused in single-dose.
