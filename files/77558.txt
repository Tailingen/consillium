Nivolumab Ipilimumab in Patients With hyperMutated Cancers Detected in Blood (NIMBLe)
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of nivolumab alone or in combination with ipilimumab in patients with metastatic or unresectable tumors harbouring mutations in genes, POLE and POLD1. These mutations will be determined by plasma cfDNA. Nivolumab and ipilimumab have been given to patients across multiple types of cancer, and safe doses and schedules have been determined.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: Ipilimumab
Objective Response Rate by RECIST 1.1, Objective Response Rate by RECIST 1.1: CR, PR, SD, or PD, 36 months
Efficacy as Measured by Objective Response Rate, Will be reported using percentages over all randomized patients with 90% exact confidence intervals, 36 months|Duration of Response, Response rates will be reported using percentages over all patients who have received at least one dose of treatment with 90% exact CI of each arm in a non-comparative analysis, 36 months|Number and Severity of Adverse Events Using CTCAE 5.0, AE rates will be reported using percentages with 90% exact CI, 36 months|Correlation Between POLE or POLD1 Mutations in Tumor and POLE or POLD1 Mutations in Blood, Correlation between POLE or POLD1 mutations in tumor and POLE or POLD1 mutations in blood: Will be assessed by Fischer's exact test in each arm, 36 months|To Evaluate Response by iRECIST, iRECIST: iCR, iPR, iSD, iUPD, iUPD/PD, 36 months
Participants in this study have been diagnosed with metastatic or unresectable solid tumors that have a mutation in POLE and/or POLD1. Nivolumab alone or in conjunction with ipilimumab is predicted to be effective against tumors with POLE and/or POLD1 mutations as these genetic changes cause increased rates of mutations in the DNA of tumor cells. These high mutation rates have been associated with response to immunotherapy agents such as nivolumab and ipilimumab.
