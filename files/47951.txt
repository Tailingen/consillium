Efficacy and Safety of Tislelizumab Combined With Bevacizumab and Albumin Paclitaxel in Lung Adenocarcinoma
The single arm clinical study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Tislelizumab combined with Bevacizumab and albumin paclitaxel in the treatment of advanced lung adenocarcinoma. All of the patients were received EGFR-TKI therapy for 1 line and disease progression. The primary endpoint is six months PFS and safety, the seconday endpoint is ORR and one-year OS rate.
Lung Adenocarcinoma Stage IV
DRUG: Tislelizumab
6m-PFS%, The proportion of 6 months progression free survival, through study completion, an average of 1 year|Safety of Tislelizumab, TEAE are adverse events that occur during or after the first administration of the study drug until 30 days after the study drug is discontinued or the new anticancer treatment is initiated or worse than at baseline (before treatment), 30 days after the trial finished
ORR, objective response rate, one year|OS rate, rate of oversurvival rate, one year
Patients who meet the inclusion criteria will receive Tislelizumab combined with Bevacizumab and albumin paclitaxel for 4 cycles. If there is no disease progression, the patient will continue to receive Tislelizumab maintenance therapy, until the disease progresses or death.
