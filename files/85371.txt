A Genomic Analysis of Evolution of Epithelia Ovarian Tumors
Epithelial ovarian carcinomatous and borderline components sometimes appeared in one patient. This study aims to analyze the genomic patterns of the carcinomatous and borderline components in the ovarian epithelial tissues. These tissues will be collected from paraffin section by microdissection to distinguish normal, carcinomatous and borderline tissues.
Epithelial Ovarian Cancer|Epithelial Ovarian Tumor of Borderline Malignancy|Driving Mutations|Progression-free Survival
Frequencies of somatic driving mutations, The differences of frequencies of somatic driving mutations will be compared between normal, carcinomatous and borderline tissues., Two years
Progression-free survival, Progression-free survival between patients with differential expressed multi-omics will be compared., Five years
