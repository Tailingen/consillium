In previous years, it had often been assumed that cognitive and behavioral declines in children who survived cancer therapy were largely a function of the prophylactic therapies (e.g., radiation, chemotherapy) that these children had received. Regardless of the etiologies of these specific late effects, the data regarding the long-term outcome of these children are strikingly consistent. Generally, the studies to date suggest significant impairments in attention and concentration that result in marked declines in academic performance and social and behavior difficulties.

Despite the clear evidence of problems with attention and concentration, as well as associated fucntional impairments (e.g., poor academic achievement and poor peer relationships), there have been few clinical trials designed to manage the cogntive late effects and neurological toxicities associated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy for children and adolescents who have survived cancer.
