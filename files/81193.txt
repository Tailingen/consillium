Chemoradiotherapy for Limited Advanced Unresectable Thymic Epithelial Tumors
This study is designed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of concurrent chemoradiotherapy for limited advanced unresectable thymoma or thymic carcinoma.

Complete resection is difficult to achieve without damaging the main organs in advanced thymoma or thymic carcinoma. The previous trials have showed that radiotherapy was significantly associated with prolonged OS and chemotherapy is playing an increasing role in treatment of patients with advanced thymoma or thymic carcinoma. However, whether concurrent chemoradiotherapy is safety in advanced thymoma or thymic carcinoma is still unknown. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of concurrent chemoradiotherapy for limited advanced unresectable thymoma or thymic carcinoma.
