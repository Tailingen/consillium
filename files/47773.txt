An Open-label, Phase I Clinical Trial of Super1 TCR-T in NY-ESO-1-positive Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This study was a phase I safety and tolerability clinical trial conducted in a single-center, open-label, 3+3 design with dose escalation.
Sarcoma|Lung Cancers|Melanoma
BIOLOGICAL: Super1 TCR-T
DLT, Determining the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of Super1 TCR-T adoptive Immunotherapy, Up to 28 Days|MDT, Determining the maximum Tolerated dose (MTD) of Super1 TCR-T adoptive Immunotherapy, Up to 28 Days
ORR, Objective response rate,defined as the proportion of subjects with a confirmed PR or better best response, One year after cell reinfusion|OS, overall survival，time from subject's treatment to death. Participants with no death recorded at the time of statistical analysis were censored at the time of the last follow-up. In cases of loss to follow-up, data were censored at the date of the last contact with the participant., One year after cell reinfusion|PFS, progression-free survival ，the time from the subject's treatment to the occurrence of PD or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. If no event (PD or death) occurred, the date of the last response assessment was the censored time for PFS., One year after cell reinfusion
After the subjects signed the informed consent form, the HLA genotype of the subjects was detected. After the HLA genotype was confirmed as A\*02, the tumor tissue was detected by immunohistochemistry. The subjects could proceed to the subsequent clinical trial if the NY-ESO-1 immunohistochemistry was positive. Each subject received only one cell reinfusion.
