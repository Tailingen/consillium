A Comparative Study of Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection and Photodynamic Therapy for Early Esophageal Cancer
The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of Photodynamic therapy (PDT) and Endoscopic submucosal (ESD) dissection in the treatment of early esophageal cancer.
Esophageal Carcinoma in Situ AJCC V7
PROCEDURE: PDT|PROCEDURE: ESD
2-year disease-free survival rate, The percent of 2 year disease-free survival after random allocation, percent, 2 year
Esophageal stenosis rate at 3 months, Stenosis rate of esophagus after 3 months, 3 months
Background: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is recommended by the NCCN guidelines as an effective method for the treatment of early esophageal cancer. However, there is no clinical trial data so far on whether its efficacy can be compared with that of standard Endoscopic submucosal (ESD). Our team will conduct a detailed study on it.

Aim: to compare the efficacy and safety of Photodynamic therapy (PDT) and Endoscopic submucosal (ESD) dissection in the treatment of early esophageal cancer.

Methods: This study intends to recruit 46 patients with early esophageal cancer and randomly divide them into two groups: one group to receive ESD and the other group to receive PDT.The efficacy and safety were observed after 2 years of follow-up.

Primary endpoints: The recurrence rates at 3 months, 6 months, and 2 years were compared.
