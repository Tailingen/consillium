Colorectal cancer is a common clinical gastrointestinal cancer. In addition to the early diagnosis of some patients, approximately 50% of patients have had distant metastases at the time of diagnosis. For patients with advanced colorectal cancer, systemic chemotherapy is the main treatment. We consider to add apatinib,a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of VEGF,to the therapy of these patients. We designed the study to explore the possibility of apatinib for Advanced Colorectal Cancer.
