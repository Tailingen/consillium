Daily Adaptive Radiation Therapy an Individualized Approach for Carcinoma of the Cervix
This is a single-arm, prospective, multi-center clinical trial designed to demonstrate that adaptive radiotherapy for locally advanced cervical cancer will translate into a decreased rate of acute gastrointestinal toxicity compared with the historically reported rate for non-adaptive intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). The timepoint for this assessment will be at week 5 of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and will use the Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE).
Cervical Cancer by FIGO Stage 2018
DEVICE: Varian Ethos Adaptive Radiation Therapy
Acute Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) GI Toxicity, GI toxicity as reported by the patient using the gastrointestinal section of the NCI-PRO questionnaire, End of external beam treatment delivery (week 5)
Key powered secondary endpoint: Fecal Urgency, Acute reported fecal urgency (as measured by the inability to defer defecation by 15 minutes), End of external beam treatment delivery (week 5)|Acute PRO Bowel Toxicity, Bowel toxicity as reported with EPIC bowel questionnaire, End of external beam treatment delivery (week 5)|Acute PRO Urinary Toxicity, Urinary toxicity as reported with EPIC urinary questionnaire, End of external beam treatment delivery (week 5)|Patient Reported Quality by EQ-5D-5L, Quality of life as document with EQ-5D-5L patient reported questionnaire, 24 months post treatment|Patient Reported Quality by EORTC, Quality of life as document with EORTC patient reported questionnaire, 24 months post treatment|Disease-free Survival, Disease-free survival at 2 years, Enrollment through 2 year follow up|Normal Tissue Complication Probability Model, Develop a normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) model of acute GI toxicity based on true integrated daily dose to the bowel, Enrollment through 2 year follow up|Workflow Feasibility, Record percentage of fractions delivered with adaptive radiation therapy vs traditional IGRT, End of external beam treatment delivery|CTCAE Toxicities, Physician reported CTCAE toxicities, Enrollment through 2 year follow up
