Efficacy of Treatment Sequences in Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Receiving Lorlatinib
The study will evaluate progression-free survival, overall survival, best response and duration of treatment in patients with advanced ALK- and ROS1-positive non-small cell lung cancer who received lorlatinib as part of the French expanded access program.

Progression free survival, time from first dose of treatment to first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause during the study, October 2015 - December 2019
Best response, best response recorded from the start of treatment until disease progression or start of further anti-cancer treatment, October 2015 - December 2019|Duration of treatment, time from first dose of treatment to discontinuation of treatment or death from any cause during the study, October 2015 - December 2019|Pattern of tumor progression, site of disease progression after each line of treatment, October 2015 - December 2019|Reason for treatment discontinuation, this may be disease progression, toxicity, death, other, October 2015 - December 2019|Duration of treatment beyond progression, time between first occurrence of disease progression and discontinuation the treatment, October 2015 - December 2019|Central Nervous System (CNS) best response, in patients with CNS measurable lesion, best response on CNS locations recorded from the start of treatment until disease progression or start of further anti-cancer treatment, October 2015 - December 2019|Central Nervous System (CNS) Progression free survival, time from first dose of treatment to first occurrence of disease progression in the CNS or death from any cause during the study, October 2015 - December 2019|Overall Survival, is defined as the time from the first dose of treatment dose and death from any cause, October 2015 - December 2019|Adverse Events, complications of lorlatinib therapy will be recorded, October 2015 - December 2019
IFCT-1803 LORLATU study will evaluate progression-free survival, overall survival, best response and duration of treatment in patients with advanced ALK- and ROS1-positive non-small cell lung cancer who received lorlatinib (PF-06463922) as part of the French expanded access program. Those outcomes will be correlated to clinical, pathological, and radiological characteristics of patients.
