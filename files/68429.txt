Phase I/II Study of Mitoxantrone, Etoposide and Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin for Acute Myeloid Leukemia
The purpose of this study is to investigate the combination of gemtuzumab ozogamicin, mitoxantrone and etoposide as second line therapy in patients with acute myeloid leukemia.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Gemtuzumab ozogamicin|DRUG: Mitoxantrone|DRUG: Etoposide
To evaluate the toxicity and response rate of the combination therapy of mitoxantrone, etoposide and gemtuzumab ozogamicin as second line therapy in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML)., Bone marrow biopsy and aspiration 14 days after gemtuzumab ozogamicin administration, to evaluate response to the study drug regimen.
To assess the overall survival in patients with AML treated with the combination of mitoxantrone, etoposide and gemtuzumab ozogamicin., Indefinite; subjects are followed for survival.
The combination of mitoxantrone and etoposide is an active regimen in refractory/relapsed AML patients. In order to improve the efficacy of mitoxantrone and etoposide as second line therapy in patients with AML we proposed to conduct a phase I/II clinical trial combining gemtuzumab ozogamicin with mitoxantrone and etoposide. The phase I portion of the trial will determine the maximum tolerated dose of gemtuzumab ozogamicin combined with mitoxantrone and etoposide and the phase II portion of the trial will determine the efficacy and safety of the combined regimen in patients with AML.
