Use of Hair to Diagnose Breast Cancer
This study aims to perform x-ray diffraction analysis of blinded hair samples from women with a documented health status, to validate the previous findings of James et al who described that x-ray diffraction patterns of human hair can distinguish samples from healthy subjects from those of diseased subjects, specifically those suffering from breast cancer.

The primary hypothesis is that x-ray diffraction of hair can be used to distinguish hair from patients with confirmed breast cancer from subjects without detectable breast cancer.
