Organ Preservation Program Using Short-Course Radiation & FOLFOXIRI in Rectal Cancer
The purpose of the research is to evaluate whether both chemotherapy and radiotherapy can lead to higher rates of clinical complete response leading to organ preservation in human subjects with cancer. The objective is to learn if this treatment approach may safely be used as an alternative to the standard treatment for rectal cancer and to know the quality-of-life in these patients.
Rectal Cancer
DRUG: FOLFOXIRI|DRUG: FOLFOX regimen|DRUG: XELOX|RADIATION: IMRT
Clinical Complete Response (cCR), Proportion of patients who achieve a clinical complete response following therapy, expressed as a number and proportion without dispersion., 8 (+/-4 ) weeks following completion of RT and chemotherapy, an average of 9 months
Number of Participants With Toxicity, Toxicity defined as non-hematologic grade 4 adverse events using CTCAE v5 or higher toxicity at least possibly related to treatment, and assessed up to 3 months after completion of radiotherapy (RT) and chemotherapy., 8 (+/- 4) weeks following completion of RT and chemotherapy, an average of 3 months|Local Regrowth Rate, Local regrowth is defined as the presence of adenocarcinoma within the rectal wall or within the mesorectum confirmed by pathology, expressed as a percentage with its 95% confidence interval., 22 (+/- 2) months following completion of RT and chemotherapy, an average of 24 months (2 years)|Disease Free Survival (DFS), DFS defined as the time from the start date of RT to the date of the first documented progression or death due to any cause assessed up to 2 years after completion of chemotherapy. Patients will be censored at the last date of follow-up if lost to follow-up prior to two years, expressed as a median with interquartile range., 22 (+/- 2) months following completion of RT and chemotherapy, an average of 24 months (2 years)|Colostomy-free Survival, Colostomy-free survival defined as the time from the start date of RT to the date of colostomy or death due to any cause assessed up to 2 years after completion of chemotherapy, expressed as a median with interquartile range. Patients will be censored at the last date of follow-up if lost to follow-up prior to two years., 22 (+/- 2) months following completion of RT and chemotherapy, an average of 24 months (2 years)|Overall Survival (OS), OS defined as death from any cause from start date of RT until death, study completion, or loss to follow-up, whichever occurs first. This will be reported as median survival time with interquartile range., 27 (+/- 4) months following completion of RT and chemotherapy, an average of 2.25 years
Primary Objective: To assess clinical complete response of an organ preservation approach using short course radiation followed by intensified chemotherapy.

Secondary Objective: To assess safety in all enrolled patients, local regrowth rate and other cancer specific outcomes (metastasis-free survival, colostomy-free survival and overall survival), longitudinal health-related quality of life of this organ preservation approach
