Study of I-125 Brachytherapy Versus Intensity-modulated Radiation Therapy to Treat Inoperable Salivary Gland Cancer
* To compare the efficacy of Iodine-125 radioactive seeds implantation versus IMRT to treat inoperable salivary gland carcinoma.
* To compare the safety of Iodine-125 radioactive seeds implantation versus IMRT to treat inoperable salivary gland carcinoma.
Salivary Gland Cancer
RADIATION: brachytherapy|RADIATION: IMRT
local control rate, According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 standard, tumor progressing during the treatment and follow up period means local control failure, which include the sum of diameters of local and region target focus increases ≥20% or ≥5mm; new focus emerges at local or region area; metastases or secondary primary tumor would not be concluded., 1 year
progression-free survival, progression-free survival is definite as the time of death of tumor progression event emerges from the patient was randomize. According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 standard, tumor progressing during the treatment and follow up period means local control failure, which include the sum of diameters of local and region target focus increases ≥20% or ≥5mm; new focus emerges at local or region area; metastases or secondary primary tumor would not be concluded. No respondent means the tumor advances at the first day., 2 years|overall survival, Refers to the result from a random start time to death of any cause. Records from the beginning of the random time to time of any cause of death. Shedding of subjects censored cases recorded censored time., From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 2 years
quality of life, Measured using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Scale Quality of life Questionnaire (QLQ)-C30 (V3.0) and the QLQ-H \& N35 (V1.0) of quality of life questionnaire., 2 year|The incidence of radiation-related adverse reactions, according to NCI-Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Event （CTCAE）4.0 standard, 2 years
The target population are those patients with inoperable salivary gland derived primary or recurrent cancer, including local advanced primary salivary gland cancer which could not be resected completely; recurrent salivary gland cancer which could not be resected completely; T3/T4 tumor which could not tolerate surgery due to severe combined disease. The subjects would be divided into Iodine-125 radioactive seeds permanent interstitial implantation brachytherapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy randomly. During the follow-up period, the efficacy and the safety index would be monitored.
