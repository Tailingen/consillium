KeyLargo: Pembrolizumab + Oxaliplatin + Capecitabine in Gastric Cancer
This study will be conducted in two stages: 1) safety validation and 2) dose expansion

1. Safety Validation Cohort: The first portion of the study will preliminarily establish the tolerability of the combination of pembrolizumab, oxaliplatin and capecitabine. Five (5) subjects will be enrolled and their safety data after 21 days of treatment will be reviewed before additional subjects are enrolled. Subjects on this portion of the study will only be enrolled at the Duke Cancer Institute.
2. Dose Expansion Cohort: The second portion of the study (ie. phase II) will enroll 30 subjects. In the dose expansion cohort, the first cycle will be modified to allow one week of pembrolizumab monotherapy before starting capecitabine and oxaliplatin (XELOX) chemotherapy, which will allow analysis of biomarkers related to pembrolizumab. Subjects on this portion of the study will be enrolled at the Duke Cancer institute and select external collaborating institutions.

The primary objective of this trial is to describe the progression free survival (PFS) associated with the combination of pembrolizumab, oxaliplatin and capecitabine (pembrolizumab +XELOX) in all patients with previously untreated metastatic esophagogastric adenocarcinoma.

DRUG: Oxaliplatin+Capecitabine+Pembrolizumab
Months of Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS measured from study entry until documented progression or death from any cause. Progression is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression. Patients who have not experienced progression will be censored at the date of the last radiographic assessment. The median PFS will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method., Up to 44 months
Response Rate as Measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), Response rate is calculated as the number of people with a complete response or partial response, divided by the total number of people treated. Complete response is defined as disappearance of all target lesions. Partial response is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., Up to 44 months|Months of Overall Survival, Overall survival is the amount of time subjects live since starting the study., Up to 44 months
