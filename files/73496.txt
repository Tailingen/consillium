BCG in Combination With Durvalumab in Adult BCG-naïve, High-risk NMIBC Participants
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy profile of durvalumab + BCG (induction and maintenance) combination therapy in adult United States participants with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), who have received no prior systemic therapy for NMIBC, and who are BCG-naïve.
Non-Muscle- Invasive Bladder Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Durvalumab|BIOLOGICAL: BCG
Incidence of Grade 3 or 4 Possibly related adverse events (PRAEs), A PRAE is defined as an AE that has been assessed by the Investigator to be possibly related to study treatment. A PRAE will be included if it has onset or worsens (by Investigator report of an increase in CTCAE (common terminology criteria for adverse events) grade relative to pre-treatment) within 6 months of initiation of study intervention and it has CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 recorded within this timeframe., From the date of the first dose of study treatment (Day 1) until 6 months after the initiation of study treatment
Number of participants with adverse events (AEs), To further assess the safety and tolerability of durvalumab + BCG (induction and maintenance) combination therapy in high risk NMIBC participants. Number of participants with adverse events (AEs), including PRAEs, adverse events of special interest (AESIs), immune-mediated AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), AEs resulting in treatment interruption and discontinuation will be assessed., From screening (Day -28 to -1) until 90 days following discontinuation of the last dose of study treatment (approximately 28 months)|Percentage of patient-reported treatment tolerability symptoms assessed using specific PRO-CTCAE (Patient-Reported Outcomes- Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events), To assess patient-reported treatment tolerability in high-risk NMIBC participants treated with durvalumab + BCG (induction and maintenance) combination therapy by descriptive summary of PRO-CTCAE.

Percentage of all dosed participants reporting each response category of each of the 19 relevant disease symptom items as measured by PRO-CTCAE. The PRO-CTCAE system, is an item bank of symptoms experienced by participants while undergoing treatment of their cancer., Up to 24 months|Complete response rate (CRR), Complete response rate (CRR) is defined as the percentage of participants having carcinoma in situ (CIS) prior to study entry or at baseline cystoscopy who do not have CIS at 6 months., At 6 months|Disease-free survival (DFS), Disease-free survival (DFS) is defined as the time from the date of first dose of study intervention until the date of first recurrence of high-risk disease or death (by any cause in the absence of recurrence) regardless of whether the participant withdraws from therapy or receives another anticancer therapy prior to recurrence., At 12 months and 24 months|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from the date of the first dose of study intervention to the date of death from any cause.

The analysis will include all dosed participants. All deaths will be included regardless of whether the participant withdraws from therapy or receives another anticancer therapy., At 24 months|Best overall response for health-related quality of life (HRQoL) as assessed by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 items (EORTC QLQ-C30), Best overall response is defined as the best response the participant achieved, based on evaluable data collected during the study period to assess disease and treatment related symptoms and HRQoL. The domains/scales of the EORTC QLQ-C30 prioritized include global HRQoL, physical functioning and fatigue. Final scores range from 0 to 100, where higher scores on the global measure of health status and functional scales indicate better health status/function, but higher scores on symptom scales represent greater symptom severity., Up to 24 months|Best overall response for HRQoL as assessed by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Non-Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer 24 (EORTC QLQ-NMIBC24), Best overall response is defined as the best response the participant achieved, based on evaluable data collected during the study period. The domains/scales of the EORTC QLQ-NMIBC24 prioritized include urinary symptoms, intravesical treatment concerns, future perspectives and sexual functioning. Final scores range from 0 to 100, higher scores on the functioning scales (sexual functioning, sexual enjoyment) indicate better health status/function, whereas higher scores on symptom scales and individual symptom items represent greater symptom severity., Up to 24 months
This is an open-label, single-arm, multi-center, Phase IIIb US study exploring the combination of durvalumab and BCG (induction and maintenance) in participants with high-risk NMIBC.

Each participant will have screening activities up to 4 weeks before initiation of study intervention, receive study intervention for up to 24 months, followed by 3 months safety follow-up. Participants will continue to be followed up for survival until 2 years from the date of treatment initiation of the last participant enrolled in this study (approximately 42 months after first participant enrolled).
