OTHER: 68Ga-NOTA-AE105 PET/CT
The number of lymph node metastases that can be identified by means of uPAR PET / CT compared with the histological findings., Through study completion, an average of 1.5 year
Evaluation of the correlation between uPAR PET signal (quantified as SUVmax) and the immunohistochemical expression of uPAR evaluated by an H-score (intensity x the percentage of stained tumor tissues throughout the tumor margin)., Through study completion, an average of 1.5 year|Evaluation of the correlation between tumor burden (assessed v.h.a. TNM staging) uPAR-PET signal (assessed as SUVmax) and the amount of uPAR metabolites in plasma., Through study completion, an average of 1.5 year|Determination of the lower detection limit of the amount of tumor tissue for uPAR-PET correlated with the histological H-score x tumor size (where tumor size is evaluated on the pathological preparation of pathologist), Through study completion, an average of 1.5 year
To compare the diagnostic value of uPAR-PET/CT for prognostication compared to the current imaging options (CT, MRI and ultrasound) by observer-blinded readings. The reference that will be used as "gold standard" is the pathological examination of the surgically removed tissues.

The new imaging modality (uPAR-PET/CT) will be used in two separate groups of patients with head and neck cancer:

Study I:

Patients with oral cancer without clinical evidence of spread (OSCC in stage cN0)

Study II:

Patients with metastatic oral cancer (OSCC in stage cN +) and patients with metastatic oropharyngeal cancer (OPSCC in stage cN +).
