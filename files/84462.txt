Objective Response Rate (ORR) for Cohort A and E, Defined as the percent of patients documented to have a confirmed CR or PR, 30 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS) at six months for Cohort C, PFS is defined as time from first study treatment until disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., 30 months
Adverse Events, Defined as number of patients with treatment emergent AEs, 30 months|Duration of Response (DOR), Defined as the time from date of the first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR) to the first documentation of either Progression of Disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., 30 months|Overall Survival (OS), Defined as time from date of first study treatment to date of death due to any cause, 30 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS), Defined as time from first study treatment until disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., 30 months|Population pharmacokinetic (PK) Model Derived AUC at Steady State (AUCtau,ss)., Concentration data from this study will be pooled with other studies and exposure parameters derived using population PK methods. Data for this Outcome Measure will not be reported here since ClinicalTrials.gov is designed to report results from participants enrolled in the study and described in the Participant Flow module., Time Frame: Pre-dose and 4-6 hours post dose; up to 6 months|Cohorts C and E: DLTs during SLI (Safety Lead In), Defined as those patients in the SLI of the study who have received at least 80% of the assigned dose of adagrasib during the first cycle on study, or interrupted or discontinued study treatment during the first cycle due to a DLT., 30 months
