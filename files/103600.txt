Study of Olaparib in Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Patients With DNA Repair Gene Mutations
Single arm, single site, open-label Phase II study of the effects of oral olaparib in participants with metastatic renal cell carcinoma that harbor an inactivating mutation in BAP-1, ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, CHEK2, BRIP1, RAD51C, BARD1, CDK12, CHEK1, FANCL, PP2R2A, RAD51B, RAD51D, or RAD54L who have had prior treatment with at least one immune checkpoint inhibitor or anti-VEGF therapy. Must have measurable disease on CT imaging per RECIST 1.1 criteria.

Reversion Mutations in Circulating Tumor DNA (ctDNA) at Clinical Progression, Number of incidences of reversion mutations in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) at time of clinical progression., 2 years
The trial will enroll up to 20 participants. Following enrollment, participants will be initially treated with olaparib 150mg by mouth twice daily for one month. After one month of therapy, the dose of olaparib will be increased to 300mg by mouth twice daily provided there are no grade 3 or greater adverse events experienced. All participants will be reassessed at least monthly for toxicity, including laboratory investigations. Radiological scans will be performed approximately every 3 months to assess for disease response. Treatment will be continued until clinical and/or radiographic progression according to RECIST 1.1 criteria or unmanageable toxicity requiring cessation.
