Gene Therapy for Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2) with ST002
This is an open-label, single-arm, dose-escalation pilot study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of ST002 in the treatment of patients with NF2 mutation-related solid tumors. ST002 injection is a gene therapy product designed for NF2. By reinserting the normal XXX gene into genetically deficient tumor cells, the product expresses Merlin. This regulates gene transcription in tumor cells, controls the tumor microenvironment, and inhibits tumor growth and invasion, achieving therapeutic effects.
NF2 Deficiency
GENETIC: ST002
Safety evaluation, Evaluate the incidence of drug-related adverse events (AEs) and adverse events (SAEs) from baseline to Week 24 after administration, with a focus on neurotoxicity and genome-wide integration carcinogenic risks., From baseline to Week 24 after administration
Efficacy evaluation, Evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) (tumor volume reduction) and duration of response (DOR) according to RECIST and itRECIST, Day 21 after administration, and at the end of study follow-up, and at early withdrawal. The frequency of checks during the research period can be adjusted according to the researcher's judgement.|Efficacy evaluation, Percentage of necrosis of tumor cells in the tumor tissue at the injection site, estimated by pathological HE staining, at Day 21 after administration., Day 21 after injection
This is an open-label, single-arm, dose-escalation pilot study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of ST002 in the treatment of patients with NF2 mutation-related solid tumors. Using a 3+3 dose escalation design, three dose groups are formulated, and three to six patients are expected to be enrolled in each dose group. A total of nine to eighteen - patients with NF2 gene mutation related solid tumors will be enrolled.
