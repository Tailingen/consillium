Efficacy and Safety Comparison of Niraparib to Placebo in Participants With Human Epidermal Growth Factor 2 Negative (HER2-) Breast Cancer Susceptibility Gene Mutation (BRCAmut) or Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) With Molecular Disease
This study will assess the efficacy and safety of Niraparib in participants with either tumor mutation in the BRCA gene (tBRCAmut) HER2- breast cancer (Independent of hormone receptor \[HR\] status, including HR positive \[+\] and TNBC) or tumor BRCA wild type (tBRCAwt) TNBC with molecular disease based on the presence of circulating tumor Deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA) following surgery or completion of adjuvant therapy.
