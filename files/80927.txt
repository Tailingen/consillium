Studying Genes in Samples From Younger Patients With Adrenocortical Tumor
RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

PURPOSE: This research trial studies genes in samples from younger patients with adrenocortical tumor.
Adrenocortical Carcinoma
GENETIC: DNA methylation analysis|GENETIC: RNA analysis|GENETIC: gene expression analysis|GENETIC: nucleic acid sequencing|GENETIC: polymorphism analysis
Identification of genetic factors affecting adrenocortical tumors|Comprehensive catalog of altered genes in adrenocortical samples
OBJECTIVES:

* To perform whole-genome sequencing, deep sequencing, micro RNA analysis, methylation status, copy number variation analysis, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) analysis in pediatric adrenocortical tumors and compare those results to those of the same patient's normal cells.

OUTLINE: Archived tumor and blood samples are analyzed for whole-genome sequencing, deep sequencing, micro RNA , methylation status, copy variation, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Results are then compared with patients' normal cells.
