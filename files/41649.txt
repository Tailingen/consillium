Safety, PK, PD, Clinical Activity of KT-333 in Adult Patients With Refractory Lymphoma, Large Granular Lymphocytic Leukemia, Solid Tumors
This Phase 1a/1b study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) of KT-333 in Adult patients with Relapsed or Refractory (R/R) Lymphomas, Large Granular Lymphocytic Leukemia (LGL-L), T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL), and Solid Tumors. The Phase 1a stage of the study will explore escalating doses of single-agent KT-333. The Phase Ib stage will consist of 4 expansion cohorts to further characterize the safety, tolerability and the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) of KT-333 in Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma (PTCL), Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma (CTCL), LGL-L, and solid tumors.

This is an open-label Phase 1a (dose escalation)/1b (dose expansion) first-in-human study of KT-333 in adult patients. Patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) lymphomas, LGL-L, T-PLL, and solid tumors will be enrolled in Phase 1a. Phase 1b will consist of separate cohorts of patients with R/R PTCL, CTCL, LGL-L, and solid tumors.
