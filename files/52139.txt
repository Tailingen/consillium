Peginterferon α-2b as a Maintenance Therapy in Participants With Multiple Myeloma Who Responded to Induction Therapy (P01972-AM7)
This study aims to assess the efficacy of peginterferon α-2b, compared to a control arm not receiving any maintenance treatment, in adult subjects with multiple myeloma who have responded to a prior induction therapy. Peginterferon α-2b will be given once weekly as an injection until disease progression or relapse, or for up to a maximum of 5 years (whichever occurs first).
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Peginterferon
Number of Days With Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as response duration while on maintenance therapy. It was the length of time during and after treatment in which a participant was living with the cancer that did not get worse.

PFS was calculated from the date of randomization to the date of the first documented tumor progression or relapse., Baseline and up to 5 years (or to the date of the first documented tumor progression or relapse)
Number of Days of Overall Survival (OS), OS was calculated from the date of randomization to the date of death for any

cause. Participants alive at the end of study were censored at the last date they were known to be alive. Participants who were still living at the end of the study were censored on the last date they were known to be alive., Baseline and up to 5 years (or to the date of the first documented tumor progression or relapse)|Number of Participants With Complete Response (CR) to Treatment, CR was defined as:

* Absence of the original monoclonal paraprotein in serum and urine by immunofixation, maintained for a minimum of 6 weeks;
* \<5% plasma cells in a bone marrow aspirate and also on trephine bone biopsy, if biopsy was performed.
* No increase in size or number of lytic bone lesions (development of a compression fracture did not include response);
* Disappearance of soft tissue plasmocytomas., Month 9 & Month 18|Number of Participants With Partial Response (PR) to Treatment, PR was defined as:

* At least 50% reduction in the level of the serum monoclonal paraprotein, maintained for a minimum of 6 weeks;
* Reduction in 24-hour urinary light chain excretion either by ≥ 90% or to \< 200 mg, maintained for a minimum of 6 weeks;
* For patients with non-secretory myeloma only, ≥ 50% reduction in plasma cells in a bone marrow aspirate and on a trephine biopsy, if biopsy was performed, maintained for a minimum of 6 weeks;
* At least 50% reduction in the size of soft tissue plasmacytomas;
* No increase in size or number of lytic bone lesions., Month 9 & Month 18|Number of Participants With Minimal Response (MR) to Treatment, MR was defined as:

* A 25-49% reduction in the level of the serum monoclonal paraprotein maintained for a minimum of 6 weeks;
* Reduction in the 24-hour urinary light chain excretion, which still exceeded 200mg/24 hours, maintained for a minimum of 6 weeks;
* For patients with non-secretory myeloma only, 25-49% reduction in plasma cells in a bone marrow aspirate and on a trephine biopsy, if biopsy was performed, maintained for a minimum of 6 weeks;
* A 25-49% reduction in the size of soft tissue plasmacytomas;
* No increase in the size or number of lityc lesions., Month 9 & Month 18|Number of Participants With Progressive Disease(PD) or Relapse From CR, PD (for patients not in CR) required one or more of the following:

* 25% increase in serum monoclonal paraprotein level, 24-hour urinary light chain excretion, or plasma cells;
* Increase in size of existing or development of new bone lesions/soft tissue plasmacytomas;
* Development of hypercalcemia.

Relapse from CR required at least one of the following:

* Reappearance of serum or urinary paraprotein;
* \>5% plasma cells;
* Development of new lytic bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas or increase in the size of residual bone lesions;
* Development of hypercalcemia., Month 9 & Month 18|Quality of Life, Participants were given the Europen Organization for Research in Cancer Therapy Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ), version 2.0, which consisted of 30 questions. The questionnaire evaluated global health/quality of life and incorporated five functional scales (Physical; Role; Emotional; Cognitive; Social). All of the scales ranged in score from 0 (worst) to 100 (best)., Screening and Last Observation (up to 5 years)
