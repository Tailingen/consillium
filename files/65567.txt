Phase III Study of the Effect of GTx-024 on Muscle Wasting in Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
The purpose of this study is to determine if the investigational drug GTx-024 can help subjects with non-small cell lung cancer increase physical function and maintain or gain muscle, also called "lean body mass".
Muscle Wasting|Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: GTx-024|DRUG: placebo
Physical Function, Measure is the percentage of subjects at day 84 with stair climb power change \>=10% from their baseline value., Day 84|Lean Body Mass, Measure is the percentage of subjects at day 84 with lean body mass change \>=0% from their baseline value., Day 84
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multicenter, multinational efficacy and safety study in subjects with non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Subjects will be evenly randomized to placebo or GTx-024 prior to initiation of first line chemotherapy. The primary efficacy analysis will be based on total lean body mass and physical function.
