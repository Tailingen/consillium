STRIDE (durvalumab + Tremelimumab) with Lenvatinib Vs STRIDE Alone in Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to compare the effects on participants' and liver cancer by adding a drug that is used on its own to treat this disease to a combination of two other drugs which is also used to treat liver cancer, compared to the two-drug combination alone.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: STRIDE (durvalumab + tremelimumab)|DRUG: Durvalumab|DRUG: Lenvatinib
Progression-free Survival using RECIST 1.1, 32 months
Overall Survival, 32 months|Number and Severity of Adverse Events using CTCAE, 32 months|Objective Response Rate using RECIST 1.1, 32 months
An earlier clinical trial showed that a single drug treatment for liver cancer helped stabilize or shrink participants' liver cancer and extend the time before their cancer got worse. A different clinical trial showed that a different two-drug combination helped extend how long participants with liver cancer lived after starting the treatment. Combinations of drugs that are similar to these treatments have been studied in a few people and seem promising, but it is not clear if the combination of all three drugs being used in this study can offer better results than standard treatment.
