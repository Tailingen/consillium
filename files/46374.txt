Immunomonitoring and Multiple Myeloma: Impact of Lenalidomide on Immune Checkpoint Expression
The myeloma microenvironment is the target of many drugs in development, and it is unclear how they can be combined with reference treatments such as lenalidomide. This pilot study consists of an extensive phenotypic characterisation of the impact of lenalidomide combined with dexamethasone on the bone marrow microenvironment of a homogeneous cohort of non-pretreated MM patients. Blood sampling will be systematically performed in a matched fashion to monitor the general effect of lenalidomide on the immune system and to detect possible peripheral markers.

This study will provide rational guidance for future combination therapies with lenalidomide.

Activation status of biological markers, Presence of active protein markers and immune checkpoints by medullary immune cell subpopulations., 1 month
With the significant increase in the number of therapeutic combinations targeting the tumour microenvironment, it is crucial to better understand the effect of reference myeloma treatments on the different immune populations present in the tumour in order to rationally optimise the combination with new strategies under development. In addition, the identification of biomarkers in the circulating blood that can predict/monitor the impact of new therapies on the immune response is a major challenge.
