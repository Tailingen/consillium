Neoadjuvant/Adjuvant Pembrolizumab Plus Chemotherapy
A phase II, single-arm, open-label study evaluating feasibility, safety and efficacy of combined chemotherapy and pembrolizumab as neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy in stage IIa-IIIB NSCLC adult patients followed by adjuvant PD-(L)1 inhibitor treatment for up to 1 year
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer|Neoadjuvant Therapy|Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor
DRUG: Pembrolizumab
MPR(major pathologic response), more than 90 percent decrease in viable tumor, Up to 8weeks
Complete pathological (CPR) response rate, The investigator assessed CPR rate was defined as the percentage of subjects who achieved complete pathological remission (no residual tumor in lung and lymph nodes), 8 weeks|EFS (event free survival), the time length from randomization (mainly from the receipt of pathology and genetic diagnosis reports)to any of the following events: disease progression, disease recurrence or death from any cause. Disease progression or relapse will be assessed according to RECIST 1.1, 8 weeks|OS (overall survival), the time length from randomization (mainly from the receipt of pathology and genetic diagnosis reports)to death from any cause., 8 weeks|Incidence of adverse events graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0, Evaluate adverse events of any cause, treatment-related adverse events, immune-mediated adverse events according to NCI-CTCAE V5.0, 8 weeks|Evaluate tissue biomarkers, The goals for these analyses are for hypothesis generating. The results will need to be confirmed by future studies.

Used for hypothesis generating. Transcriptome analysis identity markers with efficacy and/or toxicity., 8 weeks
Two to four cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in combination with pembrolizumab will be administered before surgery, followed by another one to two cycles of chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab after surgery (4 cycles neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy in total ) then use pembrolizumab monotherapy for up to 1 year.
