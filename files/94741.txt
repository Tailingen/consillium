5-Aminolevulinic Acid (5-ALA) Gliolan®: Usage Increase Proposal for Neurosurgical Procedures in High-Grade Gliomas
The goal of this observational study is to evaluate disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with malignant gliomas undergoing neurosurgical procedures using 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA)-based photodynamic therapy

DRUG: 5-Aminolevulinic Acid (5-ALA) Gliolan®|PROCEDURE: Fluorescence-Guided Surgery using 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA)
Disease-Free-Survival (PFS), Disease-Free-Survival calculates the time from treatment until the recurrence of disease or death after undergoing Fluorescence-Guided Surgery using 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA), 36 months
Overall survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as time from initiation to death of any cause, 36 months|Quality of life as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Brain (FACT-Br) questionnaire, The questionnaire provides an additional set of disease-specific questions pertaining to brain neoplasms. It consists of 46 items that refer to general issues of quality of life and specific to tumor location. Possible scores range from 0 to 108, with higher scores indicating better quality of life., 36 months|Average length of hospital stay (ALOS), The average length of stay in hospitals is often used as an indicator of efficiency. The ALOS refers to the average number of days that patients spend in hospital after surgery. It is calculated by dividing the number of bed-days by the number of discharges after procedure. Average length of stay range from 1 day to 4.5 days. Longer than average stays are usually a symptom of poor communication, quality of care, and effectiveness of treatment., 36 months
The investigators are proposing a study that provides descriptive understanding of patients with High-Grade Gliomas in Ecuador. The primary objective of this pilot study is to lay the foundations for the development of a multicenter registry patients with malignant gliomas undergoing neurosurgical procedures using 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA)-based photodynamic therapy, which will provide high-quality real data and serve as a basis for the application to future projects and elaboration of public policies in the medium and long term.
