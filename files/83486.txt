Landmark Versus Ultrasongraphy Guided Spinal Anesthesia in Lower Abdominal Surgeries in Cancer Patients: a Randomized Controlled Trial
Spinal anesthesia is a commonly employed technique for lower abdominal surgeries, providing effective anesthesia and analgesia with minimal systemic effects. In cancer patients undergoing such procedures, careful consideration of anesthetic techniques is crucial, given their often-compromised physiological state and the need to minimize postoperative complications. Two approaches to administering spinal anesthesia are Ultrasound (US)-guided and the traditional landmark-based technique.

the aim of the study :To evaluate the efficacy, safety and feasibility of US-guided spinal anesthesia versus the landmark-based technique in cancer patients undergoing lower abdominal surgery.
Cancer Surgery
PROCEDURE: spinal anesthesia|PROCEDURE: spinal anesthesia
the first-pass success rate of Combined spinal-epidural anesthesia, first-pass success was defined as the needle reaching the subarachnoid space within a single insertion attempt, without redirection, baseline
The traditional landmark method relies on palpating anatomical structures, such as the iliac crests and spinal processes, to guide needle insertion. Although widely used, it can be challenging in patients with anatomical variations, obesity, or previous surgeries, potentially leading to multiple attempts, increased patient discomfort, or complications. On the other hand, Ultrasound (US) imaging has become an increasingly popular tool among anesthesiologists to guide neuraxial blockade. US-guided spinal anesthesia provides real-time visualization of the relevant anatomy, including the spinal canal, ligaments, and surrounding tissues, enabling more accurate needle placement. This technique has gained attention for its potential to improve success rates, reduce complications, and enhance patient comfort, particularly in complex cases such as cancer patients, where precision is vital.

By examining factors such as procedural success rates, patient comfort, complication rates, and overall outcomes, we can better understand the role of ultrasound guidance in optimizing anesthetic care for this vulnerable patient population.
