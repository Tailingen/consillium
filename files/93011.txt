The Lung PCA: A Multi-Dimensional Atlas of Pulmonary Premalignancy
This protocol pertains specifically to the prospective lung squamous cell carcinoma pre-malignant lesion (PML) cohort that will form a primary study group for the Lung Pre-Cancer Atlas.
Lung Cancer
PROCEDURE: Bronchoscopies|PROCEDURE: Sputum Sample|PROCEDURE: Venipuncture
Determine Genomic Features of Pre-Malignant Lesions (PML) via Bronchoscopic Biopsy, Prospective data collection of histologic specimens for the purposes of reducing lung cancer mortalities., Start of study to post baseline bronchoscopy, up to two years|Determine Microenvironmental Features of Lung Pre-Malignant Lesions (PML) via Bronchoscopic Biopsy, Prospective data collection of histologic specimens for the purposes of reducing lung cancer mortalities., Start of study to post baseline bronchoscopy, up to two years
Via pre-screening, subjects at high risk for the development of lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) will be identified and enrolled to undergo serial bronchoscopies at 12 month intervals over a 2-3 year period. A variety of specimen types will be collected to support analyses of the genomic and microenvironmental features of these PMLs.
