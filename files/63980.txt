overall survival rate at 35 months, 35-month OSR defined as the number of patients who at 35 months after randomization have not died over the total number of evaluable patients., 35 months after date of randomization|overall survival, OS defined as the time from randomization to the date of death (due to any cause), with patients alive or lost to follow-up at the analysis data cut-off date censored at their last contact date., Baseline through the end of the study (up 72 months)|progression-free from randomization to second progression or death, Total PFS defined as the time from randomization to second disease progression (i.e. progression during the second-line treatment) or death (due to any cause)., Baseline through the end of the study (up 72 months)|progression-free survival in first-line treatment and in second-line treatment, PFS in first-line treatment defined as the time from randomization to disease progression or death (due to any cause) during first-line treatment. PFS in second-line treatment defined as the time from the date of second-line treatment initiation to disease progression or death (due to any cause) during secondline treatment., Baseline through the end of the study (up 72 months)|time to first-line treatment failure and to second-line treatment failure, Time to first-line treatment failure defined as the time form randomization to disease progression, death (due to any cause) or discontinuation due to toxicity during first-line treatment. Time to second-line treatment failure defined as the time from the date of second-line treatment initiation to disease progression, death (due to any cause) or discontinuation due to toxicity during second-line treatment., 72 months|objective response rate, Proportion of patients with an objective response (complete or partial response) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) 1.1 criteria in first-line treatment and in second-line treatment., Baseline through the end of the study (up 72 months)|proportion of patients with Early Tumour Shrinkage, Proportion of patients with ETS in first-line treatment and in second-line treatment. ETS will be defined as a reduction in tumour size â‰¥30% (RECIST 1.1 criteria) at the first evaluation (i.e. week 12), Baseline through the end of the study (up 72 months)|Depth of Response, DpR measured as the maximum decrease in target measurement (RECIST 1.1 criteria) during the complete course of evaluation in first-line treatment and in second-line treatment., Baseline through the end of the study (up 72 months)|disease control rate, Proportion of patients with disease control (complete, partial response or stable disease) in first-line treatment and in second-line treatment., Baseline through the end of the study (up 72 months)|duration of disease control, Duration of disease control defined as time from first confirmed disease control to disease progression per RECIST 1.1 criteria or death (due to any cause) in first-line treatment and in second-line treatment. For patients with disease control who have not progressed or died at last observation, duration of disease control will be censored at their last evaluable disease assessment date., Baseline through the end of the study (up 72 months)|duration of response, Duration of response defined as time from first confirmed objective response to disease progression per RECIST 1.1 criteria or death (due to any cause) in first-line treatment and in second-line treatment. For patients with response who have not progressed or died at last observation, duration of response will be censored at their last evaluable disease assessment date., Baseline through the end of the study (up 72 months)|time to response, Time to response in first-line treatment defined as the time from randomization to the date of first confirmed objective response per RECIST 1.1 criteria during first-line treatment.

Time to response in second-line treatment defined as the time from the date of second-line treatment initiation to the date of first confirmed objective response per RECIST 1.1 criteria during second-line treatment., Baseline through the end of the study (up 72 months)|Incidence and severity of AEs CTCAE v4.03 criteria, Safety assessment will consist of monitoring adverse events (AEs), including AEs of special interest, serious AEs (SAEs) and laboratory safety parameters. AEs will be graded according to National Cancer Institute - Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 4.03., Baseline through the end of the study (up 72 months)
