Transarterial Chemoembolization (TACE) Plus Bevacizumab for Liver Metastases
Trans arterial chemoembolization (TACE) has emerged as a treatment option for chemotherapy-refractory diseases in Liver metastases. By delivering chemotherapy agents directly to the tumor site, TACE can maximize local drug concentrations and reduce systemic adverse reactions. Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that functions as an angiogenesis inhibitor. It works by slowing the growth of new blood vessels by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). The application of Bevacizumab during TACE has not been reported. In this study, we will evaluate the the overall survival (OS)、efficacy, and safety of the application of Bevacizumab during TACE in patients with Liver Metastases by designing an open, single-arm phase II clinical study.
