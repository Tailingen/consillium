CBF and NCF Changes With Brain Radiation
This study will be a dual-arm prospective longitudinal cohort study for patients with brain metastases, at least one of which is appropriate for radiotherapy, to explore brain and cognitive changes following SRS or WBRT and evaluate the feasibility of a novel MRI protocol to identify potential radiological biomarkers of NCF decline.

Patients diagnosed with brain mets will be assigned to either Arm A or Arm B, depending on their treatment plan. Patients in Arm A will be treated with SRS. Patients in Arm B will be treated with WBRT.

Patients' neurocognitive function will be assessed before their radiation treatment and followed up for 2 years post treatment.

RADIATION: SRS and neurocognitive assessments|RADIATION: WBRT and neurocognitive assessments
change in neurocognitive function (NCF), To characterize change in NCF from baseline (pre-SRS treatment), to 24 months following using the NCF-A Battery, Over 24 months
Symptomatic Radiation Toxicity, A diagnosis of symptomatic radiation toxicity will be based on a clinical onset of symptoms and radiological findings of radionecrosis at 3-24 months following radiosurgery, with or without pathological confirmation, 3-24 months|Local Failure, Local failure will be defined as one of the following (follow-up MRI or CT brain scans will be compared to the prior MRI or CT brain scan): Increase of \> 25% in the size of any lesion or a new, non- contiguous lesion developed outside the radiosurgical bed (in the brain or meninges). Radionecrosis will not be considered tumor progression., up to 24 months|Distant Failure, Distant disease is considered to be new metastatic lesions in the brain or outside the brain following WBRT and SRS., up to 24 months|Survival, Survival time will be measured from the date the patient is enrolled in this study to death, due to any cause, up to 24 months
