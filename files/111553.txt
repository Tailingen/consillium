Freenome is using a type of artificial intelligence, called machine learning, to identify patterns of cell-free biomarkers in blood to detect cancer early. The purpose of this prospective multi-center observational study is to validate a blood-based test for the detection of colorectal cancer by collecting blood samples from average-risk participants who will undergo a routine screening colonoscopy.
