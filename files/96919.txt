Effects of Pre-emptive Scalp Infiltration With Low-dose Ketorolac and Ropivacaine for Postoperative Pain
The PAINLESS study is a single-center, prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded-endpoint (PROBE) controlled clinical pilot study to compare the efficacy and safety of pre-emptive scalp infiltration with ropivacaine plus ketorolac and ropivacaine alone for postoperative pain relief in adults undergoing elective supratentorial craniotomies.
