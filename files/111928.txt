Study of Everolimus With Paclitaxel and Carboplatin in Patients With Metastatic Melanoma
Based on data demonstrating synergy between paclitaxel and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition, the investigators propose that the addition of everolimus to paclitaxel with carboplatin should lead to improvements in efficacy as measured by progression-free survival and response rate.
Metastatic Melanoma
DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Everolimus
Progression-free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from randomization until objective tumor progression (PD) or death. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., 18 months
Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from randomization until death from any cause., 18 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the Percentage of Patients Who Experience an Objective Benefit From Treatment. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by MRI or CT: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., 18 months
