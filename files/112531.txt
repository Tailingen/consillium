* The primary objective of the escalation part is to assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of PQR309 combined with the standard eribulin dose in patients with HER2 negative breast cancer following a "modified" 3 by 3 design.
* For the expansion part the objective is to evaluate efficacy of PQR309 in combination with eribulin in patients with Triple Negative Breast Cancer
* Once the MTD of continuous daily PQR309 dosing has been established, intermittent schedules of PQR309 ("2 days on/ 5 days off" or "Monday / Thursday") will be evaluated.
