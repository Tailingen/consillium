PET-MRI in Diagnosing Patients With Colon or Rectal Cancer
This pilot clinical trial studies positron emission tomography (PET)-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and PET-computed tomography (CT) as diagnostic imaging in patients with colon and/or rectal cancer. New diagnostic imaging procedures, such as PET-MRI, may help find and diagnose rectal cancer or recurrence of colorectal cancer

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To test the diagnostic performance of PET- MRI in the staging of preoperative high-grade rectal cancer patients, defined by T3 stage or higher or N1 stage or higher or presence of metastasis, that are referred to PET-CT and MRI.

II. To test the diagnostic performance of PET-MRI the follow up of colorectal cancer patients that are referred to PET-CT with or without a diagnostic MRI request by their physicians.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To test different attenuation correction MR sequences and novel diagnostic MR sequences.

OUTLINE:

Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F 18 PET-CT and PET-MRI.
