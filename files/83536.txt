A Study of TS-1 Plus Cisplatin in Patients With Advanced Non-small-cell Lung Cancer
Objectives:

1. Primary Objective:

   To bridge the data of efficacy in term of overall response rate of TS-1 plus cisplatin in Taiwanese advanced NSCLC patients from that gained from Japanese population
2. Secondary Objectives:

A. To assess progression free survival B. To assess overall survival C. To bridge the safety profile by assessing the toxicities and tolerability
