Efavirenz in Treating Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer
RATIONALE: Efavirenz may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well efavirenz works in treating patients with metastatic prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: efavirenz
Percentage of Participants Without Prostate-specific Antigen Progression at 3 Months, Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) non-progression rate is defined as the rate of patients with the absence of PSA progression.

PSA progression is defined as follows :

* In patients whose PSA has not decreased, progressive disease is a 25% increase over the baseline (on-study) and an increase in the absolute-value PSA level by at least 5 ng/mL, which is confirmed by a second value.
* In patients whose PSA has decreased but has not reached response criteria, progressive disease would be considered to have occurred when PSA increases 25% over the nadir, provided that the increase is a minimum of 5 ng/mL and is confirmed.

For the 3-month evaluation, patients who died within the 3 first months will be considered as progressions.

PSA assessment is to be performed every 28 days in the first 6 months after inclusion then every 3 months until progression or end of treatment. PSA assessment to establish eligibility is to be obtained from the same local laboratory using the same PSA assay., 3 months
Percentage of Participants Without Prostate-specific Antigen Progression at 6 Months, Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) non-progression rate is defined as the rate of patients with the absence of PSA progression.

PSA progression is defined as follows :

* In patients whose PSA has not decreased, progressive disease is a 25% increase over the baseline (on-study) and an increase in the absolute-value PSA level by at least 5 ng/mL, which is confirmed by a second value.
* In patients whose PSA has decreased but has not reached response criteria, progressive disease would be considered to have occurred when PSA increases 25% over the nadir, provided that the increase is a minimum of 5 ng/mL and is confirmed.

For the 6-month evaluation, patients who died within the 6 first months will be considered as progressions.

PSA assessment is to be performed every 28 days in the first 6 months after inclusion then every 3 months until progression or end of treatment. PSA assessment to establish eligibility is to be obtained from the same local laboratory using the same PSA assay., 6 months
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To assess the effect of efavirenz on the PSA non-progression rate at 3 months in patients with castration-refractory metastatic prostate cancer.

Secondary

* To assess the effect of efavirenz on the PSA non-progression rate at 6 months.
* To assess the effect of efavirenz on overall survival.
* To assess the effect of efavirenz on PSA progression-free survival..
* To assess the tolerability and safety profile of efavirenz.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive oral efavirenz once daily in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
