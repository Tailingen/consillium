This is a Phase 1, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and preliminary antitumor activity of NT-175 in HLA-A\*02:01 subjects with unresectable, advanced, and/or metastatic NSCLC, colorectal adenocarcinoma, HNSCC, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, or any other solid tumor histologies that are positive for the TP53 R175H mutation.

Dose Escalation will investigate escalating doses of NT-175 in adult subjects with eligible solid tumor histologies and will evaluate the safety and MTD.

Disease Histology Evaluation will further evaluate the safety and preliminary anti-tumor activity at or below the MTD in disease specific histologies and determine the RP2D. .

Disease Cohort Expansion will further evaluate the preliminary anti-tumor activity and safety of NT-175 at the RP2D in disease specific settings.
