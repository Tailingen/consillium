Systematic Radioiodine Administration Versus Decision of Radioiodine Treatment Guided by a Post-operative Work-up
This trial is comparing two strategies in intermediate-risk differentiated thyroid cancer patients: Systematic radioiodine administration versus decision of radioiodine treatment guided by a post-operative work-up based on serum Tg values and diagnostic RAI scintigraphy
Thyroid Cancer|Intermediate Risk
DRUG: Systematic RAI-treatment|OTHER: Decision of RAI-treatment guided by a post-operative assessment
the rate of patients with excellent tumoral response, normal neck ultrasonography and Tg/LT4 \<0.2 ng/mL and absence of TgAb and if performed, no abnormalities on other imaging modalities, 36 months after randomization
Patient's quality-of-life, Comparison of the scores on SF-36 (score between 0 and 100) between 2 arms, During I131 treatment and at 1 and 3 years|Salivary, nasal and lachrymal toxicities, Comparison of the intensity of salivary, nasal and lachrymal toxicities between 2 arms, During I131 treatment and at 1,2,3 and 5 years|Management cost, Costs of all medical exams and transportation related to the care within 5 years post-randomization in both groups, through study completion, an average of 5 years|Patient's anxiety, Comparison of the scores on STAI questionnaire (score between 20 and 80) between 2 arms, During I131 treatment and at 1 and 3 years
