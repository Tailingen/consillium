Total Intravenous Anesthesia and Recurrence Free Survival
The investigators propose to compare recurrence-free survival in patients having potentially curative (Stages 1-3) surgery for esophageal cancer who will be randomly assigned to propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia or sevoflurane-based balanced general anesthesia.
Esophageal Cancer
DRUG: Propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia|DRUG: Sevoflurane intravenous anesthesia
Recurrence-free survival, Patients who did not experience cancer recurrence and/or death., 4 years
ICU duration, Postoperative time in ICU during initial admission., From ICU admission until the date of ICU discharge or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months|Hospital duration, Postoperative time spent in hospital during initial admission., Up to 100 months|QoR-15, Quality of Recovery 15 score on postoperative day 2., 2 days
The investigators will test the primary hypothesis that recurrence-free survival after esophageal cancer surgery is longer in patients randomized to propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia than to volatile sevoflurane anesthesia.

The investigators will test the secondary hypotheses that propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia: 1) speeds discharge from the ICU; 2) speeds discharge from the hospital; and, 3) improves the quality of recovery, as assessed by QoR-15 on postoperative day 2.
