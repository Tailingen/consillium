The INR is derived from prothrombin time (PT) which is calculated as a ratio of the patient's PT to a control PT standardized for the potency of the thromboplastin reagent developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) using the following formula: INR = Patient PT ÷ Control PT.

Normal values for INR: 0.9-1.3., 24 hours, 1 week and 1 month and 2 months|Immunologic Assessment_Part 1, Immunological response of ablation will be evaluated on the basis of immune tests conducted and tumor biomarker assessments (including, but not limited to, immune tests: CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD45+, CD16+, CD56+ and CD19+ from Baseline/Screening to 1-day post ablation, 1 week and 1 and 2 months post procedureprocedure., Baseline/Screening, 1-day post ablation, 1 week and 1 and 2 months post procedure|Immunologic Assessment_Part 2, Immunological response of ablation will be evaluated on the basis of immune tests conducted and tumor biomarker assessments: C-reactive protein \[CRP\], from baseline to evaluation visits 1 day, 1 week and 1 and 2 months post procedure., Screening, 24 hours, 1 week and 1 and 2 months post procedure.|Immunologic Assessment_Part 3, Immunological response of ablation will be evaluated on the basis of immune tests conducted and tumor biomarker assessments (including, but not limited to, immune tests): complement C3 and C4, immunoglobulins \[IgG, IgM, IgA\] from baseline to evaluation visits 1 day, 1 week and 1 and 2 months post procedure., Screening, 24 hours post ablation, 1 week and 1 and 2 months post procedure.|Immunologic Assessment_Part 4, Immunological response of ablation will be evaluated on the basis of immune tests conducted and tumor biomarker assessments (including, but not limited to, immune tests: complement CH50, alfa-fetoprotein \[AFP\], Cancer Antigens CA15-3 \[Breast Cancer\] and CA 19-9 \[Pancreatic Cancer\]) from baseline to evaluation visits 1 day, 1 week and 1 and 2 months post procedure., Screening, 24 hours post ablation, 1 week and 1 and 2 months post procedure.|Immunologic Assessment_Part 5, Immunological response of ablation will be evaluated on the basis of immune tests conducted and tumor biomarker assessments (including, but not limited to, immune tests): interleukin-6 \[IL-6\] from baseline to evaluation visits 1 day, 1 week and 1 and 2 months post procedure., Screening, 24 hours post ablation, 1 week and 1 and 2 months post procedure.|Immunologic Assessment_Part 6, Immunological response of ablation will be evaluated on the basis of immune tests conducted and tumor biomarker assessments (including, but not limited to, immune tests): carcinoembryonic antigen \[CEA\] from baseline to evaluation visits 1 day, 1 week and 1 and 2 months post procedure., Screening, 24 hours post ablation, 1 week and 1 and 2 months post procedure.|Assesment of Quality of Life by Using Patient Questtionaires EORTC QLQ-C30. (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer), The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item generic health-related QoL instrument designed to assess cancer patients' physical, psychological and social functioning. It is composed of 9 multi-item scales (5 functional scales \[physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social\], a global QoL scale \[GQoL\], and 3 symptom scales \[fatigue, pain, and nausea and vomiting\]), 5 single-item symptom scales assessing additional symptoms commonly reported by cancer patients (dyspnoea, loss of appetite, insomnia, constipation and diarrhea), and an item on the perceived financial impact of the disease.

All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0-100. A high scale score represents a higher response level. Thus, a high score for a functional scale represents a high/healthy level of functioning. A high score for the global health status/QoL represents a high QoL. However, a high score for a symptom scale/item represents a high level of symptomatology/problems., Screening, 1 and 2 months post procedure.|Pain Assessment by VAS Scale, Perform pain assessment by a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) where 0 is "no pain" and 100 is "the maximum pain possible" at 1-day and 1-week post-procedure., 1-day post ablation and 1 week post procedure.|Analgesic Requirements After the Ablation Procedure, Evaluate analgesic treatment prescription in the 24-hour period post-procedure and during the one week period post-procedure., in the 24-hour period post-procedure and during the one week period post-procedure
The study will assess the technical performance of the VORTX Rx device to deliver acoustic energy for cavitation-based cellular destruction. The planned duration of a single target tumor will be 60 minutes or less in a single session and adjusted intra-procedurally as necessary per investigator discretion. Subjects in this study must have an adequate acoustic window in the abdominal space in order to be eligible for enrollment. All patients who undergo ablation with the investigation device will be treated in a hospital environment under general anesthesia not to exceed four hours.
