Caloric Restriction Before Surgery in Treating Patients With Endometrial, Prostate, or Breast Cancer
The purpose of this trial is to determine that sort term calorie restriction will affect tumor biology in biopsy proven breast, endometrial or prostate cancers, which will positively impact biomarkers including miR-21, an onco-miR known to impact cancer outcomes.

If sufficient events occur, may assess the impact of various patient and clinical/treatment variables on these outcomes via Cox proportional hazards regression. Will be assessed and compared with historic controls using the Kaplan Meier method., From the date of study enrollment to time of event, assessed up to 12 weeks|Distant metastases, assessed through patient records, Will be analyzed via survival methods, specifically the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test. If sufficient events occur, may assess the impact of various patient and clinical/treatment variables on these outcomes via Cox proportional hazards regression. Will be assessed and compared with historic controls using the Kaplan Meier method., From the date of study enrollment to time of event, assessed up to 12 weeks|Progression free survival, assessed through patient records, Will be analyzed via survival methods, specifically the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test. If sufficient events occur, may assess the impact of various patient and clinical/treatment variables on these outcomes via Cox proportional hazards regression. Will be assessed and compared with historic controls using the Kaplan Meier method., From the date of study enrollment to time of event, assessed up to 12 weeks|Overall survival, assessed through patient records, Will be analyzed via survival methods, specifically the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test. If sufficient events occur, may assess the impact of various patient and clinical/treatment variables on these outcomes via Cox proportional hazards regression. Will be assessed and compared with historic controls using the Kaplan Meier method., From the date of study enrollment to time of event, assessed up to 12 weeks|Change in weight, defined by body mass index as weight in kg divided by height in meters squared, Will be assessed by modeling BMI as a function of time via mixed-effects regression., Baseline up to 12 weeks|Change in blood pressure, Will be assessed as a function of time via mixed-effects regression., Baseline up to 12 weeks|Change in heart rate, Will be assessed as a function of time via mixed-effects regression., Baseline up to 12 weeks|Change in respiratory rate, Will be assessed as a function of time via mixed-effects regression., Baseline up to 12 weeks|Change in psycho-social outcomes, assessed by the FACT-P, Will be assessed as a function of time via mixed-effects regression., Baseline up to 12 weeks|Change in psycho-social outcomes, assessed by the FACT-En, Will be assessed as a function of time via mixed-effects regression., Baseline up to 12 weeks|Change in psycho-social outcomes, assessed by the POMIS cancer fatigue short form, Will be assessed as a function of time via mixed-effects regression., Baseline up to 12 weeks
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

1) Investigate if caloric restriction will change serum micro ribonucleic acid (RNA) 21 (miR-21) expression in patients with prostate, endometrial or breast cancer.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

1. Investigate measurable changes induced by caloric restriction on both patient (host) and tumor characteristics from caloric restriction.
2. Investigate the adherence of the patient to the diet.

4) Weight, height, and body composition will be assessed via BodyMetrix. BodyMetrix uses ultrasound technology to measure subcutaneous fat.

5) Patients will have psycho-social evaluation using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) test (prostate cancer), FACT-Breast (B) test (breast cancer), or the FACT-Endometrial Cancer (En) test (endometrial cancer) and the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) cancer fatigue short form at baseline, midway through diet, and at the conclusion of the diet.

6) Patient's nutritional status (Mini Nutritional Assessment \[MNA\] form) will be assessed, and their caloric needs will be calculated.

7) Local recurrence, progression free survival, distant metastases and overall survival will be assessed.
