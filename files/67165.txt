Lesion Detection Assessment in the Liver: Standard vs Low Radiation Dose Using Varied Post-Processing Techniques
To compare 2 different image creation/processing techniques during a standard CT scan in order to "see" problems in the liver and learn which method provides better image quality. The techniques use new artificial intelligence software to decrease image noise, which helps the radiologist to evaluate.
Diseases of Liver|Colon Carcinoma|Colorectal Carcinoma|Liver Metastases
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Computed Tomography Scan - 50% Dose Reduction|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Computed Tomography Scan - 70% Dose Reduction|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Deep Learning Image Reconstruction (DLIR)
Metastasis Detection Accuracy, Primary endpoint is metastasis detection accuracy status of each patient, where the standard of care scan reviewed by ''truth readers'' (independent to the blinded radiologists) serve as the gold standard. If any lesion of a patient is diagnosed as metastasis by "truth readers" or blinded readers' consensus, that patient will be considered true positive and diagnosis positive, respectively. The expected accuracy of standard CT is 95%, and a low dose CT detection be considered non-inferior if its accuracy is 85% or higher., 1 day
Primary Objective:

To evaluate whether post-processing software Adaptive Statistical Iterative Reconstruction (ASIR), ASIR-V, Veo 3.0 (GE version of Model-based Iterative Reconstruction (MBIR), and Deep Learning Image Reconstruction (DLIR) is able to preserve lesion detection in the liver and other measures of image quality at reduced radiation doses for computed tomography (CT).

Secondary Objectives:

Assessment of whether post-processing software enhances lesion detection in the liver and other measures of image quality at standard and reduced radiation doses.

Assessment of whether DLIR and GSI DLIR reconstructions perform differently, both in terms of accuracy and image quality metrics such as noise reduction.
