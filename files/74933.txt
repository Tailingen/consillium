A Real-world Study of the Efficacy and Safety of ICIs as First-line Therapy for Advanced Malignancies
In this study, we collected the data of immunohistochemistry, gene detection, image, OS, PFS, Orr, and so on. Secondly, the database of immunotherapy for malignant tumor was established, and the predictive model was constructed to verify and establish the rationality and validity of the biomarkers and predictive system of immunotherapy
Malignant Tumor|Immunotherapy|Artificial Intelligence
Progression-free survival, The time between randomization and the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, six months
Overall survival, Time from randomization to death from any cause, two years|Objective response rate, Proportion of patients whose tumors have shrunk to pre-defined volumes and who are able to maintain minimum time requirements, one years|Immune-Related Adverse Events, In clinical trials of antineoplastic drugs/therapies, all levels of adverse drug reactions that are judged to be related to immune mechanisms,, two years
Indicators of cardiac injury, Including but not limited to troponin, BNP and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, two years
