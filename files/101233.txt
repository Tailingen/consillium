A Study of Nivolumab Plus Brentuximab Vedotin in Patients Between 5 and 30 Years Old, With Hodgkin's Lymphoma (cHL), Relapsed or Refractory From First Line Treatment
The purpose of this study is to determine whether nivolumab plus brentuximab vedotin (followed by brentuximab vedotin plus bendamustine in patient with suboptimal response) is safe and effective in treating patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma (cHL). Eligible patients are children, adolescents, and young adults relapsed or refractory to first line.

Complete Metabolic Response (CMR) Rate at Any Time Prior to Radiation Therapy by Blinded Independent Centralized Review (BICR) - Cohort 1, The complete metabolic response (CMR) rate is defined as the percent of all response-evaluable participants who, assessed by the BICR, achieved best response of CMR.

Complete metabolic response (CMR):

* Lymph nodes/extralymphatic sites: Score 1, 2, 3 with/without residual mass on 5-point scale
* New lesions: No
* Bone marrow: No FDG-avid disease Participants who stopped study treatment early for toxicity without a CMR were evaluable.

Confidence interval is based on the Clopper and Pearson method, From first dose to complete metabolic response or the completion of six cycles of therapy (up to approximately 18 weeks).|Event-free Survival (EFS) Rate at 3 Years by Blinded Independent Centralized Review (BICR) - Cohort 1, Event Free Survival (EFS) is the time from the first treatment to the earliest occurrence of composite events including: Disease progression (PD), Failure to achieve complete metabolic response (CMR) after 4 cycles of N+Bv and 2 cycles of Bv+B, Secondary malignancy, Death .

PD :
