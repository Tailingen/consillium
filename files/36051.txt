Study of Anlotinib in Patients With Radioiodine Refractory Differentiated Thyroid Cancer
This study aims to observe and explore the efficacy and safety of Anlotinib combined with penpulimab in the treatment of radioiodine refractory differentiated thyroid cancer with first-line resistance to angiogenesis inhibitors, and to summarize the treatment experience of population.
Locally Advanced or Metastatic Radioiodine-refractory Differentiated Thyroid Carcinoma
DRUG: Anlotinib Hydrochloride Capsule and Penpulimab
Overall Response Rate (ORR), The proportion of subjects who achieves a best overall response of CR(Complete Response) or PR(Partial response)., Baseline up to 2 years.|changes in Tg level, The percentage of decrease in serum Tg from baseline;, Baseline up to 2 years.
Progression-free Survival (PFS), From the first dose of Anlotinib to the date of objective disease progression or death, whichever occurs first, Baseline up to 2 years.|Disease-control Rate（DCR）, The proportion of subjects response of CR, PR, or SD(Stable disease) (subjects achieving SD will be included in the DCR if they maintain SD for ≥4 weeks)., Baseline up to 2 years.|Duration of Response（DOR）, From the date that CR or PR are first occurred to the date of objective disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., Baseline up to 2 years.|Overall Survival（OS）, From randomization to the time of death from any cause., Baseline up to 2 years.|Time to response(TTR), From randomization to the time of response from any cause., Baseline up to 2 years.
