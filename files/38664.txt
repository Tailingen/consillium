A Study to Evaluate Once-Daily Oral VT-464 in Patients With Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer
The goal of this clinical study is to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and activity of once-daily (QD) oral dosing of VT-464, a lyase-selective inhibitor of CYP17, in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).
Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer|CRPC
DRUG: VT-464: given orally once daily in 28 day cycles
The safety and tolerability of VT-464 by evaluating adverse events, vital signs, physical examination findings, concomitant medications and laboratory tests., The first 28-day continuous dosing cycle at target dose.
Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of VT-464, After the first dose of VT-464|Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) of VT-464, After the first dose of VT-464|Time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) of VT-464, After the first dose of VT-464
The change in PSA from baseline using waterfall plots in response to VT-464, At least monthly over the first 8 28-day dosing cycles|Objective tumor response to VT-464 at the end of even-numbered cycles using RECIST 1.1 criteria, At least every other month over the first 8 28-day dosing cycles|The absolute and percent change from baseline in adrenal, pituitary, and testicular hormone concentrations in response to VT-464, At least monthly over the first 8 28-day dosing cycles
This is a Phase 1/2 study of VT-464 in chemotherapy-na√Øve CRPC patients who are treatment-naive or who have failed prior therapy with abiraterone and/or enzalutamide. The study will examine several parallel QD dosing regimens of VT-464 using a traditional modified "3+3" Fibonacci study design. Approximately 3 dose-levels of VT-464 will be examined in each dosing regimen that is fully enrolled.
