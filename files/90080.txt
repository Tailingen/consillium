Radiofrequency Ablation of Tumors
Background: This prospective study was designed to be the first to evaluate the toxicity of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in patients with recurrent pediatric solid tumors.

Methods: From 2003 through 2006, we conducted a phase I, IRB-approved study of RFA for recurrent solid tumors. A multidisciplinary cancer management team selected appropriate candidates for the study. Imaging-guided RFA was performed percutaneously. Response was assessed at 3 months. Repeat RFA was performed for some incompletely ablated or new lesions.
