Paclitaxel Liposome for Squamous Non-Small-cell Lung Cancer Study(LIPUSU)
The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and the safety of paclitaxel liposome and cisplatin compared with gemcitabine and cisplatin as first-line therapy in advanced squamous non-small-cell lung cancer .
Squamous Non-small-cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Paclitaxel Liposome|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Cisplatin
Progression Free Survival, Progression free survival will be calculated from study entry to documented disease progression using RECISTv1.1 or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., From study entry to measured progressive disease, up to 2 years
Objective Response Rate, Objective response rate is the percentage of participants who achieve best overall tumor response of complete response or partial response ., From study entry to measured progressive disease, up to 2 years|Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined from study entry to the date of death from any cause., From study entry to death from any cause, up to 2 years|Adverse events, Adverse events is evaluated according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0, From baseline until 21 days after the last dose|Quality of Life questionnaire, The quality of life is assessed using the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Questionnaire Core-30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) and Quality of Life Questionnaire Lung Cancer 13(QLQ-LC13)., From study entry to measured progressive disease, up to 2 years|Correlation between gene sequence or expression level and therapeutic effect, Correlation between gene sequence or expression level and therapeutic effect is assessed using the blood or tumor tissue of subjects by genetic testing, From study entry untill radiological disease progression, up to 2 years
