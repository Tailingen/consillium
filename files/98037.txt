Tarlatamab vs Standard of Care Chemotherapy in Patients With Pre-treated Advanced, Pulmonary or Gastroenteropancreatic Poorly Differentiated Neuroendocrine Carcinomas (NECs)
Based on the efficacy of tarlatamab in patients with small-cell lung cancer, we aim to assess the efficacy of tarlatamab in patients with Advanced, pulmonary (large-cell only) or gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma.

The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire - Core Questionnaire C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) is a 30 item instrument meant to assess some of the different aspects that define the quality of life of cancer patients.
