MicroEnvironment Tumor Effects of Radiotherapy - Comprehensive Radiobiology Assessment TRial
This study is a dynamically adjustable prospective longitudinal study designed to capture biospecimen (biopsy, blood, surgical) and multimodal treatment-related data (imaging, dosimetry, clinical) before, during, and after treatment with definitive-intent chemoradiotherapy for patients with locally advanced cervical and pancreatic cancer.

Changes in tumor microenvironment, Generalized linear mixed effects models will be first used to capture the changes in the longitudinal values of a single assay output over time for a given biospecimen. Random effects will be used to describe the correlation of repeated measures on the same subject over time., From start of follow-up through completion of follow-up (estimated to be 5 years)
