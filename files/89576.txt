Benefit of Transcutaneous Auricular Vagus Nerve Stimulation in Improving
        Quality of Life in First Line Treatment of Ovarian Cancer:
Impact of stimulation of parasympathetic activity by transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) on quality of life (QoL) relating to digestive symptoms in patients undergoing first-line treatment for ovarian cancer, as compared to shame taVNS
Ovarian Carcinoma|First Line Chemotherapy|Digestive System Disorders
DEVICE: transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation|DEVICE: Placebo device
assess the impact of stimulation of parasympathetic activity by transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) on quality of life (QoL) relating to digestive symptoms in patients undergoing first-line treatment for ovarian cancer, as compared t, Score of the QoL dimension relating to digestive symptoms according to the EORTC QLQ-OV28 self-questionnaire, At the beginning of Cycle 3 (each cycle is 21 days)".
The evolution of heart rate variability (HRV) during chemotherapy between the 2 groups of patients, Heart Rate Variability (HRV) parameters through an electrocardiogram; as an exploratory complementary objective, for patients in Caen centres, HRV will also be measured using a Polar H10 type measuring device to determine two parameters SDDN and RMSSD, Measured at inclusion and on day 1 of each course before chemotherapy infusion|The safety profile, Adverse events with regards to the use of the device, according to NCI-CTCAE V5.0, During chemotherapy (6 cycles, each cycle is 21 days), so up to 5 months after inclusion|The compliance with the use of the device, Number of daily taVNS stimulations and stimulation durations, taVNS (electrical) frequencies, according to ear device recordings, During chemotherapy (6 cycles, each cycle is 21 days), so up to 5 months after inclusion|- The evolution of markers of inflammation (NLR, CRP, Albumin) during chemotherapy, - Blood concentrations of inflammatory markers : Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), CRP, Albumin,, At inclusion and during cycles 3 and 6 of chemotherapy (each cycle is 21 days)|Quality of life during chemotherapy, Quality of life scores according to the standardized self-questionnaire EORTC QLQ-C30, At inclusion, at courses 3 and 6 of chemotherapy (each cycle is 21 days)|The dose-intensity of chemotherapy in first-line treatment, Dose of chemotherapy delivered per time unit, During chemotherapy (6 cycles, each cycle is 21 days), so up to 5 months after inclusion|The progression-free survival, Progression-free survival (PFS) defined as time between randomization and first disease progression according to RECIST v1.1 criteria or death whatever cause (in the absence of progression), From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months
Impact of stimulation of parasympathetic activity by transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) on quality of life (QoL) relating to digestive symptoms in patients undergoing first-line treatment for ovarian cancer, as compared to shame taVNS

Randomization between:

* Experimental group: transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS)
* Control group: placebo using the same device that does not deliver electrical stimulation
