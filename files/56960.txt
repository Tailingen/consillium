Phase 1/1b/2 Study of Oral PMD-026 in Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to test the safety and tolerability of PMD-026 in patients with metastatic breast cancer. PMD-026 is a targeted oral agent designed to kill tumor cells in metastatic breast cancer.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: PMD-026|DRUG: fulvestrant
Safety and tolerability of PMD-026 in combination with fulvestrant in patients with HR+/HER2- previously treated breast cancer, Incidence of AEs, DLTs, SAEs. Changes in laboratory, vital signs, and ECG values., 6 weeks
Plasma concentration of PMD-026 when administered in combination with fulvestrant, The plasma concentration will be measured as part of pharmacokinetic (PK) testing., As determined by PK data|Preliminary anti-tumor activity of PMD-026 when dosed in combination with fulvestrant, ORR, DOR, DCR, PFS, Until PD or death, up to 2 years
Assess OS, OS defined as time from first dose to death, Throughout study|Assess gene expression, Profile gene expression in ctDNA, prior to PMD-026 administration|Evaluate QT interval and PMD-026 concentrations, Qualitative and/or quantitative associations of PK parameter concentrations with QTcF changes, Throughout study
Combination with fulvestrant (Part 3):

This study will prospectively enroll RSK2+, HR+, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2-) patients to evaluate PMD-026 in combination with a standard dose and schedule of fulvestrant. Fulvestrant will be dosed per the package insert in combination with PMD-026 at the RP2D determined in the monotherapy phase of the study. Up to 20 patients will be enrolled with locally advanced or metastatic HR+/HER2- breast cancer previously treated with a CDK4/6 inhibitor in combination with endocrine therapy.
