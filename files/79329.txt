A Pilot Study of Hormonal Therapy Combined With Central Memory T Cells (Tcm) for Patients With Advanced Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, safety and oncological efficacy of hormonal therapy combined with autologous Tcm cells for patients with advanced prostate cancer.
Prostatic Neoplasms
BIOLOGICAL: Tcm+ Goserelin acetate+ Bicalutamide|BIOLOGICAL: Tcm+Goserelin acetate+Abiraterone acetate
Incidences of adverse events or serious adverse events (AE and SAE), This is graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) grading scale, version 4.0, 2 years
Time to castration-resistance (TCR) in mHSPC patients, Defined as the time from treatment initiation to the first castration-resistant event (radiographic disease progression, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression or the occurrence of the first symptomatic skeletal event), whichever occurs first, 2 years|Overall survival (OS), Defined as time from treatment initiation to death, 2 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), Defined as the time from treatment initiation to disease progression, relapse or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, 2 years
Adoptive cancer immunotherapy,the infusion of tumor-reactive T cells to patients,represents a promising approach for the treatment of advanced metastatic disease.It has been shown that central memory T cells (Tcm) were the optimal antitumor T cells for adoptive cell transfer in cancer patients.However,the potential of autologous Tcm cells to treat the advanced prostate cancer has not been evaluated.

This is an open-label pilot study to determine if the infusion of autologous Tcm cells combined with hormonal therapy is safe and effective for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.This study will have the following two cohorts:Cohort A) metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) treated with maximal androgen blockade plus autologous Tcm cells and Cohort B) metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) treated with abiraterone acetate plus autologous Tcm cells.A total of 60 evaluable subjects will be enrolled over an enrollment period of 24 months.The study is planned to enroll approximately 30 evaluable subjects in each treatment cohort.
