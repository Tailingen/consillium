Registry Study to Evaluate the Clinical Outcome of Cancer Patients and Benign Diseases Treated with Radiation
Registry database repository for determining clinical outcomes primarily of patients who have received or have been evaluated for radiation treatment in either the definitive or palliative setting for both malignant and benign etiologies.

To compare the outcomes with National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) of the American College of Surgeon(ACS).

OTHER: Retrospective Populations
Quality of Life Analysis, The quality of life questionnaire will be used as a standardized instrument to measure the health outcome.Its provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value for health status. The US version of the EQ-5D will be used, to enable mapping of general HR-QOL scores from EQ-5D scores into health state utility scores (ranging from 0 to 100) for the US population.Analyses will be performed for all subjects having received treatment for benign and cancer tumors. Information gained from this could lead to improved medical care for them. By performing comparative study for subgroups of patients with similar diseases but not treated with radiation therapy, potential benefits and risks of radiation therapy may be better delineated., 10 years
Investigator will retrospectively collect and evaluate information from patients with cancer or benign etiologies to improve future clinical outcomes and help identify prospective outcomes study questions. This information will include patients' name, medical record number, medical history, diagnosis, treatment, laboratory test results, diagnostic test results, pathology reports, therapeutic and nontherapeutic results, surgical results, radiology results, radiation therapy details (dose, techniques, toxicity), concurrent use of chemotherapy/systemic therapy, quality of life outcomes,cachexia status, and primarily last follow-up data. All information will be collected after their standard of care visits.
