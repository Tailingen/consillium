A Research on Hidden Blood Loss in Open Radical Hysterectomy and Pelvic Lymphadenectomy
The aim of this cross-sectional study is to evaluate the hidden blood loss in patients who underwent open radical hysterectomy and identity its risk factors.
Hidden Blood Loss|Open Radical Hysterectomy|Cervical Cancer
the volume of hidden blood loss (mL), the volume of invisible blood loss occurring in patients who undergo open radical hysterectomy applying Gross's formula, 10 months after surgery
the risk factors of hidden blood loss, Performing multiple linear regression analysis with SPSS 17.0, we plan to identify the factors which may increase the volume of hidden blood loss from possible factors like hypertension, diebetes, etc., 10 months after surgery|the volume of total blood loss (mL), the vomule of patients' blood loss through the whole perioperative time according to the method of Nadler, 10 months after surgery|the volume of visible blood loss (mL), the visible blood loss including the blood in the suction bottle and in weighed compresses during the operation and the drainage volume after the operation, 10 months after surgery
The electronic medical data of 100 patients who undergo open radial hysterectomy in the following year to treat cervical cancer will be analyzed retrospectively in this study. The amount of hidden blood loss will be calculated according to Gross's formula. And multiple linear regression analysis will be employed to identify its risk factors.
