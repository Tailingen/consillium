gliomasPCV Only in 1p/19q Codeleted Anaplastic Gliomas
Patients with 1p/19q-codeleted anaplastic gliomas treated with RT + PCV are at risk of neurocognitive deterioration. Treating these patients with PCV alone (could reduce the risk of neurocognitive deterioration without impairing overall survival.
Anaplastic Gliomas With 1p/19q Codeletion
DRUG: PCV chemotherapy alone|DRUG: Radiotherapy+PCV chemotherapy
Survival without neurocognitive deterioration, Survival without neurocognitive deterioration (whatever the cause of deterioration, i.e toxicity or tumor progression) defined as the time from study registration to failure in any of the 6 cognitive domains that will be explored (i.e memory, working memory, language, visuo-spatial ability, cognitive executive functions, behavioral executive functions) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., 9 years
progression free survival, 9 years|overall survival, 9 years
Multicentric, Randomized phase III study (1:1), Population: newly diagnosed 1p/19-codeleted anaplastic gliomas, Primary objective: To determine whether treating newly diagnosed 1p/19q-codeleted anaplastic gliomas with PCV alone can increase overall survival without neurocognitive deterioration Control group: radiotherapy followed by 6 cycles of PCV chemotherapy. Experimental group: 6 cycles of PCV chemotherapy (radiotherapy being deferred at the time of progression).

Number of centres participating: the 33 centers of the POLA network Recruitment duration: 7 years, the accrual rate being 40 patients per year, and patients are followed-up until the end of the trial.
