Pembrolizumab for Metastatic NSCLC Patients Expressing PD-L1 Who Have Their Own PDX
This is a single center, open-label, single arm study in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) expressing PD-L1 after failure of platinum-based combination chemotherapy.

Patients will be treated with Pembrolizumab according to the dosage and administration in Product Information of Keytruda in Korea (2mg/kg) until it is changed to 200mg flat dose.

The patient should have their-own patient-derived xenograft (PDX) before enrollment of the study. The PDX will be used to set up their humanized CD34 PDX (Hu-CD34 PDX).
Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma
DRUG: Pembrolizumab Injection
Comparison of clinical response and in-vivo anti-tumor response using Hu-CD34 PDX, response rate based on RECIST 1.1, every 6 weeks, up to 96weeks
Part A: Clinical trial (single arm study) in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) expressing PD-L1 after failure of platinum-based combination chemotherapy.

Part B: PDX experiment using Hu-CD34 PDX model in specific population selected from Part A (Clinical trial part) - responder and non-responder.

In-vivo experiment using Hu-CD34 PDX will be done for about seven subjects, and thirty-two (32) Hu-CD34 PDX mice will be established from single patient to see in-vivo response. This research using PDX (Part B) will be conducted sequentially on clinical trial part in selected-population based on clinical response of Pembrolizumab.
