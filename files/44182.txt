Pyrotinib and Vinorelbine Tartrate Capsules With or Without Inetetamab for First Line Treatment in Patients With Trastuzumab-resistant HER2-positive Advanced Breast Cancer
Trastuzumab resistance, which is a common therapeutic challenge in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer, is not fully understood. Pyrotinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting EGFR, HER-2 and HER-4 receptors. More general inhibition of ErbB family with pyrotinib could provide additional benefit. Inetetamab could bind to HER2 extracellular domain (ECD) with high affinity and inhibit proliferation of multiple HER2-overexpressing cancer cell lines as a single agent or in combination with trastuzumab. This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pyrotinib and vinorelbine tartrate capsulesin with or without Inetetamab for first line treatment in patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer who had early failure on or after trastuzumab treatment.
