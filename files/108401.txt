Feasibility of a Nurse-Supported Mobile App for Self-Help CBT-I in Cancer Caregivers
Study Goal The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate whether a nurse-supported mobile app for self-help cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is feasible for cancer caregivers and whether it can improve their sleep-related outcomes and overall well-being.

Main Questions

1. Feasibility:

   Can the intervention be successfully implemented in terms of recruitment, retention, adherence to the intervention protocol, safety, and participant satisfaction?
2. Preliminary Effects:

Does the intervention improve subjective sleep outcomes (e.g., insomnia severity, sleep quality, total sleep time, time in bed, sleep efficiency, wake after sleep onset, and sleep onset latency) as well as depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, fatigue, caregiver burden, and health-related quality of life?

What Participants Will Do i) Use a 6-week self-help CBT-I program delivered via a WeChat mini program. ii) Receive weekly nurse support sessions (up to 20 minutes each) for six weeks.

* These sessions may be conducted via phone calls or instant messaging, based on participant preference.
* Each session includes reviewing weekly progress, addressing any barriers to adherence, and planning next steps.

BEHAVIORAL: Nurse-Supported Mobile App for Self-Help CBT-I
Recruitment rate, The recruitment rate will be evaluated by the percentage of the target number of participants successfully recruited per month., Every month, up to 1 year|Retention rate, The retention rate will be assessed by the percentage of recruited participants providing outcome data at post-intervention time point., 6 weeks after randomization|Adherence rate, The adherence rate will be measured by the percentage of recruited participants who adhere to the proposed intervention, including reviewing sessions on the WeChat mini program and engaging in weekly nurse support sessions., 6 weeks after randomization|Participants' perspectives of acceptability and satisfaction, The participants' perspectives of acceptability and satisfaction will be evaluated using eight adapted items from the Acceptability E-scale. Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert scale, with scores ranging from 1 to 5. The total score ranges from 8 to 40, with higher scores indicating greater acceptability and satisfaction with the intervention., 6 weeks after randomization|Adverse events, All adverse events reported by the participants will be documented., Throughout the study period (from baseline to 6 weeks post-randomization)|Participants' perceived experiences of the proposed intervention, Participants' perceived experiences of the proposed intervention (e.g., intervention delivery, adherence, safety, and satisfaction) will be assessed through post-intervention qualitative interviews to provide a further understanding of the intervention's feasibility., 6 weeks post-randomization
Insomnia severity, Insomnia severity will be assessed by Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). The ISI is a well-validated, 7-item scale designed to assess the severity of insomnia retrospectively over the past 2 weeks. Total scores range from 0 to 28, with higher scores indicating more severe insomnia symptoms., T0 (Baseline): prior to randomization, T1 (6 weeks): 6 weeks after randomization|Sleep patterns, Sleep patterns (i.e., total sleep time \[TST\], time in bed \[TIB\], sleep efficiency \[SE\], wake after sleep onset \[WASO\], and sleep onset latency \[SOL\]) will be assessed using the Consensus Sleep Diary (CSD). The CSD is widely used to assess subjective sleep and help capture more subtle variations in sleep., T0 (Baseline): prior to randomization, T1 (6 weeks): 6 weeks after randomization|Sleep quality, Sleep quality will be assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The PSQI is a widely used, 19-item questionnaire designed to measure various aspects of sleep quality over the past month. Scores range from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating poorer sleep quality., T0 (Baseline): prior to randomization, T1 (6 weeks): 6 weeks after randomization|Caregiver burden, The caregiver burden will be evaluated by Zarit Burden Interview-12 (ZBI-12). The ZBI-12 is a widely used, 12-item shortened version of the original ZBI, designed to assess the subjective burden experienced by informal caregivers. Total scores range from 0 to 48, with higher scores indicating a greater level of caregiver burden., T0 (Baseline): prior to randomization, T1 (6 weeks): 6 weeks after randomization|Depressive symptoms, Depressive symptoms will be assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). The PHQ-9 is a widely used, 9-item questionnaire designed to screen for, diagnose, monitor, and measure the severity of depression. Each item evaluates the frequency of depressive symptoms experienced over the past two weeks. Total scores range from 0 to 27, with higher scores indicating more severe depressive symptoms., T0 (Baseline): prior to randomization, T1 (6 weeks): 6 weeks after randomization|Anxiety symptoms, Anxiety symptoms will be assessed using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7). This self-administered, 7-item questionnaire was designed as a screening tool and a severity measure for GAD. Each item asks about the frequency of anxiety symptoms over the past two weeks. Scores range from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating more severe anxiety symptoms., T0 (Baseline): prior to randomization, T1 (6 weeks): 6 weeks after randomization|Fatigue, Fatigue will be assessed using the Multi-Dimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI). The MFI is a 20-item self-report questionnaire designed to measure five dimensions of fatigue (i.e., general fatigue, mental fatigue, physical fatigue, reduced activity, and reduced motivation). Total scores range from 20 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater levels of fatigue., T0 (Baseline): prior to randomization, T1 (6 weeks): 6 weeks after randomization|Health-related quality of life, Health-related quality of life will be assessed using the five-dimension five-level European Quality of Life scale (EQ-5D-5L). The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized questionnaire designed to evaluate five dimensions of health: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The EQ-5D-5L score ranges from -0.39 to 1, with higher scores indicating better quality of life. Additionally, the EQ-5D-5L includes a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for overall self-rated health status, with scores ranging from 0 to 100, where higher scores represent better health-related quality of life., T0 (Baseline): prior to randomization, T1 (6 weeks): 6 weeks after randomization
Study Goal The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate whether a nurse-supported mobile app for self-help cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is feasible for cancer caregivers and whether it can improve their sleep-related outcomes and overall well-being.
