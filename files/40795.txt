Phase Ib Clinical Study of Keynatinib
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, PK characteristics in subjects with relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphoma. Furthermore, the relationship between the exposure level of Keynatinib and its efficacy and safety, the penetration rate of keynatinib in the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) and its PK characteristics in cerebrospinal fluid in R/R-PCNSL patients, the relationship between the BTK receptor occupancy rate and the efficacy are also evaluated.
Lymphoma, B-Cell
DRUG: Keynatinib
Objective Response Rate (CR+PR), The proportion of subjects whose optimal efficacy observed from the beginning of administration is CR or PR., Every 2 administration cycles in cycle 1-6 and every 3 administration cycles in cycle 7-n.
This tiral adopts a multi-center, single-arm, multi-cohort, and open-label design to evaluate the efficacy and safety of keynatinib in patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphoma.

There will be three cohorts in this trial, details as follows: Cohort 1: R/R-PCNSL subjects; Cohort 2: R/R-CLL/SLL subjects; Cohort 3: R/R-MCL subjects.

10-25 subjects will be enrolled in the R/R-PCNSL, R/R-CLL/SLL, and R/R-MCL cohorts, respectively.
