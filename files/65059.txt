MRI DWI None-Gaussian Model Predicting Early Response to Immunotherapy in Digestive System Malignancies: a Prospective Observational Study
This is a prospective two cohorts observational study aimed to investigate the predicting value of MRI none-Gaussian model in digestive malignancies patients who received single agent PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor or combined immunotherapy.

Objective Response Rate, The rate of patients reached complete response or partial response., from enrollment of the first subject until the database cut-off approximately 12 months later.
Progress free survival, the time from enrollment to disease progression or death or loss of follow-up., from enrollment of the first subject until the database cut-off approximately 12 months later.|Overall survival, the time from enrollment to death or loss of follow-up., from enrollment of the first subject until the database cut-off approximately 12 months later.
