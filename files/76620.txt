Study on the Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of HX009 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is an open, multiple-dose administration dose exploratory clinical phase I study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK profile of HX009 Injection in patients with advanced solid tumors and to provide a preliminary measure of its antitumor efficacy. It includes Phase Ia and Phase Ib.

phase Ia is a dose exploratory study to evaluate safety, tolerability, and to determine the MTD and/or RP2D.The sponsor and investigator will adjust the magnitude of the dose escalation and the dosing cycle based on the safety and tolerability of HX009 Injection and the PK data that have been obtained, as well as decide whether to add an unplanned dose or dosing cycle to the trial, and recommend the RP2D.The Ia phase dose escalation design model is shown below. The planned dosing cycle for this study is once every 2 weeks (14 days) (Q2W) with IV HX009.

Based on the result of phase 1a,10 mg/kg Q2W was the recommended dose for phase 1b. The aimed population for 1b is patients diagnosed with advanced melanoma, and divided into two cohorts:: cohort A ,untreated patients with unresectable or metastatic advanced melanoma;and Cohort B, patients with unresectable or metastatic malignant melanoma that had been treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. The enrollment of Cohort B will start first.,and whether the cohort A will be initiated depends on the results of the cohort B .The up to 80 patients will be enrolled in Phase Ib.

In phase Ia: Incidence of Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT) of HX009 in patients with advanced solid tumors, Adverse events (AEs) determined by the investigator are recorded and graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE - Version 5.0)., At the end of Cycle 2 (each cycle is 14 days)|Incidence of adverse events (AE) of HX009 in patients with advanced solid tumors, Adverse events (AEs) determined by the investigator are recorded and graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE - Version 5.0)., Collected adverse events from signing of informed consent through at least 28 days after the end of treatment, or until other cancer treatment regimens have been started (whichever occurs earlier).|In phase IB:Incidence of Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT) in HX009 in patients with advanced solid tumors, Incidence and severity of adverse events as assessed by the investigator according to RECIST 1.1;, At the end of Cycle 2 (each cycle is 14 days)

The study is divided into a screening, treatment, and follow-up period. The Treatment Period may continue to be administered until the investigator determines that the subject no longer benefits, or the subject develops intolerable toxicity, or the subject withdraws informed consent, or the disease progresses or is treated with an antineoplastic agent other than those specified in the protocol, or the subject dies, or is lost to follow-up, or a Phase Ib subject has been administered for 2 years (whichever occurs earliest).

Subjects who withdraw from the study/terminate treatment for any reason are required to return for 1 follow-up visit after the last dose, to collect as many RO blood samples as possible after discontinuation (only partial subjects in Phase Ib), and to collect clinical data on safety as well as survival. During the subsequent follow-up period (for Phase Ib only), subjects or family members will receive a telephone visit to inquire about survival and antitumor therapy.
