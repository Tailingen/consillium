Afatinib Combined With Chemotherapy as Conversion Therapy in Unresectable EGFR Sensitive Mutation-positive Stage III NSCLC
This is a phase II, single-arm study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Afatinib plus chemotherapy as conversion treatment in patients with unresectable EGFR sensitive mutation-positive stage III non-small cell lung cancer.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung

This single-arm, open-label, prospective phase II clinical trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of afatinib plus chemotherapy as conversion treatment in patients with unresectable EGFR sensitive mutation-positive stage III non-small cell lung cancer.

The primary endpoint was the rate of NSCLC converting to resectable tumors. The secondary endpoints included R0 resection rate, major pathological response (MPR) rate, pathological complete response (pCR) rate, tumor downstaging rate, objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), 1-year event-free survival (EFS) rate, EFS and overall survival (OS).
