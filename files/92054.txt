Phase 3 Study of Teclistamab in Combination With Lenalidomide and Teclistamab Alone Versus Lenalidomide Alone in Participants With Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma as Maintenance Therapy Following Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation
This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, Phase 3 study in participants with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma to evaluate the benefits of teclistamab in combination with lenalidomide and teclistamab alone versus lenalidomide alone as maintenance therapy after autologous stem cell transplant.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Teclistamab|DRUG: Lenalidomide
Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of disease progression (as assessed by IMWG criteria) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., from randomization to the date of disease progression or death (approximately up to 8 years)|Minimal Residual Disease (MRD)-negative Complete Response (CR), 12-month MRD-negative CR is defined as participants who achieve MRD-negative status at 12 months, as determined by next-generation flow cytometry (NGF) with sensitivity of 10\^-5, prior to progressive disease or subsequent anti-myeloma therapy, whichever is earlier, and who also achieve CR of better, according to IMWG criteria., at month 12
Comparison of efficacy, Efficacy, assessed by rate of CR or better, MRD negative CR, sustained MRD negativity, CR and MRD negative conversion PFS after next line of therapy (PFS2), time to next treatment (TTNT), OS and also safety, PK and immunogenicity, from randomization to the date of disease progression or death (approximately up to 8 years)|Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS), measured from the date of from randomization to the date the subject's death, from the date of from randomization to the date the subject's death, assessed up to 8 years]|Change in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire 30-item Core module (EORTC QLQ-C30) score and the difference between-treatment arms, The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire containing both single and multi-item measures. These include five functional scales (Physical, Role, Cognitive, Emotional, and Social Functioning), three symptom scales (Fatigue, Pain, and Nausea/Vomiting), a Global Health Status/ Quality-of-Life (QoL) scale, and six single items (Constipation, Diarrhea, Insomnia, Dyspnea, Appetite Loss, and Financial Difficulties). The scores ranges from 0-100, a high score for functional scales and for Global Health Status/QoL represent better functioning ability or Health-Related Quality-of-Life (HRQoL), whereas a high score for symptom scales and single items represents significant symptomatology., baseline up to 8 years|EQ-5D-5L health utility values and the difference between-treatment arms, The EQ-5D-5L is a 5 item questionnaire that assesses 5 domains including mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression plus a visual analog scale rating "health today", baseline up to 8 years|MySIm-Q Symptom and Impacts in Patients With Multiple Myeloma and the difference between treatment arms, The MySIm-Q is a disease-specific PRO assessment complementary to the EORTC-QLQ-C30. It includes 17 items resulting in a symptom subscale and an impact subscale. The recall period is the "past 7 days", and responses are reported on a 5-point verbal rating scale., baseline up to 8 years|PRO-CTCAE to evaluate symptomatic toxicities by self-report and the difference between treatment arms, The PRO-CTCAE Measurement System characterizes the frequency, severity, interference, and presence/absence of symptomatic toxicities. The PRO-CTCAE Item Library includes 124 items representing 78 symptomatic toxicities drawn from the CTCAE, baseline up to week 24|PGIS to evaluate the patient global impression of severity of the Multiple Myeloma and the difference between treatment arms, PGIS is a 1 item questionnaire that evaluates patients' health and assesses if there has been an improvement or decline in clinical status, baseline up to 8 years
