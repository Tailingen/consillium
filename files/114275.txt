Regorafenib-pembrolizumab vs. TACE/TARE in Intermediate Stage HCC Beyond Up-to-7
REPLACE is a phase III, multicenter, randomized, open-label trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of regorafenib and pembrolizumab (Rego-Pembro) versus transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) or transarterial radioembolization (TARE) for the first-line treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC or liver cancer). Approximately 496 patients in around 80 clinical sites worldwide will be randomized to receive either:

* Investigational arm: Regorafenib in combination with pembrolizumab
* Control arm: Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) or transarterial radioembolization (TARE)

In both arms, patients will receive trial treatment until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, deterioration of patient's condition that warrants permanent trial treatment discontinuation or other treatment discontinuation criteria is met. After trial treatment discontinuation, subsequent treatment will be administered according to the Investigator's clinical judgment.

A grading scale is provided for each AE term with unique clinical descriptions of severity based on this general guideline: Grade 1 (mild) to 5 (death).

EORTC QLQ C30 is a quality-of-life questionnaire to assess patients' physical, psychological and social functions. The questionnaire is composed of functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, social), symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea and vomiting), global health status and quality of life scale, also several single-item symptom measures (scaling of items: 1 = Not at all to 4 = Very much; 1 = Very poor to 7 = Excellent). Scores range from 0 to 100, with a high score representing a better health-related quality of life., up to 3.5 years|Change from Baseline in Health-related Quality of Life in Hepatocellular Carcinoma as Assessed by European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer's Quality of Life Questionnaire for HCC (EORTC QLQ-HCC18), To evaluate patient reported outcomes in the two treatment arms (rego-pembro versus loco-regional therapy) as assessed by EORTC QLQ-HCC18. EORTC QLQ-HCC18 is an 18-question module specifically to assess symptom burden and impact on health-related quality of life measuring HCC-specific symptoms. The instrument is an 18-item scale, and scores are based on a 4-point Likert scale (with 1 = 'not at all' to 4 = 'very much'); scaled scores range from 0-100 with a higher score indicating worse symptoms., up to 3.5 years|Change from Baseline in Health-Related Quality of Life as Assessed by the EuroQol's 5-level EQ-5D Health Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L), To evaluate patient reported outcomes for health-related quality of life in the two treatment arms (rego-pembro versus loco-regional therapy) as assessed by health questionnaire EQ-5D-5L.

There are 3,125 possible health states defined by combining one level from each dimension, ranging from 11111 (full health) to 55555 (worst health)., up to 3.5 years
REPLACE is a phase III, multicenter, randomized, open-label trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of systemic therapy with Rego-Pembro versus loco-regional therapy with TACE or TARE, for the first-line treatment of intermediate-stage HCC with beyond up-to-7 criteria. Approximately 496 patients (\~248 in each arm) from approximately 80 sites will be randomized in order to power the trial efficiently to measure a clinically meaningful improvement for the primary endpoint, PFS according to mRECIST based on the Investigator´s assessment.

The trial will include patients who have been diagnosed with intermediate-stage HCC by biopsy, cytology or diagnostic imaging, such as dynamic computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), according to the criteria of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD). Patients should have at least one measurable lesion per RECIST 1.1, disease not amenable to curative treatment but amenable to loco-regional therapy with TACE (cTACE or DEB-TACE) or TARE, ECOG PS 0-1, Child-Pugh class A, and beyond up-to-7 criteria.

The trial will include the following phases:

* Screening
* Treatment
* Follow-up

Randomized patients will receive either:

Investigational arm (Arm A):

-Regorafenib at a dose of 90 mg orally q.d. on days 1 to 21 of a 4-week cycle.

In combination with:

-Pembrolizumab 400 mg using a 30-minutes i.v. infusion, on day 1 (D1) of a 6-week cycle.

Control arm (Arm B):

-Patients will be treated with TACE or TARE "on-demand" according to site's standard, with the goal of controlling all known liver lesions.

In both arms, patients will receive trial treatment (Rego-Pembro or TACE/TARE) until PD per mRECIST, unacceptable toxicity, deterioration of patient's condition that warrants permanent trial treatment discontinuation or other treatment discontinuation criteria are met.
