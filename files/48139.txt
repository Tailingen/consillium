Evaluation of LBL-003 Phase I Study in Patients With Advanced Malignancies
This study is a single-arm, dose-escalation phase I clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic characteristics and preliminary efficacy of LBL-003 injection in patients with advanced malignant tumors.
Advanced Malignant Tumor
DRUG: LBL-003 Injection
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), MTD is defined as the hightest dose level at which no more than 1 out of 6 subjects experiences a DLT during the first cycles., Within 4 weeks after receiving the first dose of the test drug|Dose-limiting toxicities（DLT）, DLT describes side effects of a drug or other treatment that are serious enough to prevent an increase in dose or level of that treatment. It was used to evaluate the safety., Within 4 weeks after receiving the first dose of the test drug
Number of subjcects with adverse events and serious adverse events, The safety profile of LBL-003 will be assessed by monitoring the adverse event(AE), From all subjects signed the informed consent form up to the completion of the follow-up period of drug withdrawal (30 days after drug withdrawal or before the start of new anti-tumor therapy|Cmax, Maximum serum concentration, From all subjects signed the informed consent form up to the completion of the follow-up period of drug withdrawal (30 days after drug withdrawal or before the start of new anti-tumor therapy|Tmax, After taking a single dose, Time to reach maximum plasma concentration, From all subjects signed the informed consent form up to the completion of the follow-up period of drug withdrawal (30 days after drug withdrawal or before the start of new anti-tumor therapy|immunogenicity, The immunogenicity is evaluated by the incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) and neutralizing antibodies (if applicable) in subjects, From all subjects signed the informed consent form up to the completion of the follow-up period of drug withdrawal (30 days after drug withdrawal or before the start of new anti-tumor therapy|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR (including the rates of complete response (CR) and partial response (PR)), evaluated based on the RECIST 1.1, refers to the percentage of study subjects who achieve a complete response or partial response., From all subjects signed the informed consent form up to the completion of the follow-up period of drug withdrawal (30 days after drug withdrawal or before the start of new anti-tumor therapy).|Pharmacodynamic (PD) index, The evaluation index is receptor occupancy rate in peripheral blood, From all subjects signed the informed consent form up to the completion of the follow-up period of drug withdrawal (30 days after drug withdrawal or before the start of new anti-tumor therapy
The purpose of the single-dose escalation study of LBL-003 in subjects with advanced malignant tumors was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of monotherapy to determine the MTD (or MAD) and to determine the clinically recommended dose of LBL-003 monotherapy.

All subjects in this study underwent pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) studies. The dosing frequency of LBL-003 is once every 2 weeks (Q2W), and the subsequent dosing frequency is adjusted according to the obtained PK and tolerability results.

This study is expected to enroll 17-36 patients with solid tumors who have no standard treatment or have treatment failure with standard treatment or are not suitable for standard treatment at this stage.
