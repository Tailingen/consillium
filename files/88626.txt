CNS Vital Signs is a computerized neuropsychological/neurocognitive assessment platform used by clinicians and researchers to objectively evaluate brain function and neurocognitive status, offering a range of tests and tools for assessment and management of various neurological and behavioral conditions., 2 weeks|Cognitive performance on Symbol Digit Coding Test, Assessed using the CNS Vital Signs computerized testing platform ("brain games"). CNS Vital Signs is a computerized neuropsychological/neurocognitive assessment platform used by clinicians and researchers to objectively evaluate brain function and neurocognitive status, offering a range of tests and tools for assessment and management of various neurological and behavioral conditions., 2 weeks|Cognitive performance on Shifting Attention Test, Assessed using the CNS Vital Signs computerized testing platform ("brain games"). CNS Vital Signs is a computerized neuropsychological/neurocognitive assessment platform used by clinicians and researchers to objectively evaluate brain function and neurocognitive status, offering a range of tests and tools for assessment and management of various neurological and behavioral conditions., 2 weeks|Cognitive performance on Continuous Performance Test, Assessed using the CNS Vital Signs computerized testing platform ("brain games")., Up to 4 weeks|Cognitive performance on Reasoning Test, Assessed using the CNS Vital Signs computerized testing platform ("brain games"). CNS Vital Signs is a computerized neuropsychological/neurocognitive assessment platform used by clinicians and researchers to objectively evaluate brain function and neurocognitive status, offering a range of tests and tools for assessment and management of various neurological and behavioral conditions., 2 weeks|Cognitive performance on Four Part Continuous Performance Test, Assessed using the CNS Vital Signs computerized testing platform ("brain games"). CNS Vital Signs is a computerized neuropsychological/neurocognitive assessment platform used by clinicians and researchers to objectively evaluate brain function and neurocognitive status, offering a range of tests and tools for assessment and management of various neurological and behavioral conditions., 2 weeks|Self-reported cognition - FACT-COG, Evaluated using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Function (FACT-COG), a 37-item questionnaire assessing cognitive impairment, cognitive abilities, and quality of life over the past 7 days. Responses are on a 5-point scale (Never; About once a week; Two to three times a week; Nearly every day; Several times a day). Higher scores generally indicate better self-reported cognition., 2 weeks|Average weekly minutes of physical activity, Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) will be measured using an accelerometer (activPAL) which participants will wear on their non-dominant thigh for 7 consecutive days., 2 weeks
