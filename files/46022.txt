Dose Escalation and Expansion Study of GSK3359609 in Participants With Selected Advanced Solid Tumors (INDUCE-1)
GSK3359609 is an anti-Inducible T cell Co-Stimulator (ICOS) receptor agonist antibody intended for the treatment of cancers of different histology. This is a first-time-in-human (FTIH), open-label, multicenter study designed to investigate the safety, pharmacology, and preliminary antitumor activity in participants with selected, advanced or recurrent solid tumors with the aim to establish recommended dose(s) of GSK3359609 for further exploration as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab or chemotherapy regimens. The study is comprised of two primary parts, each composed of two phases: Part 1: GSK3359609 monotherapy with Part 1A as dose escalation phase and Part 1B as cohort expansion phase; Part 2: GSK3359609 combination therapy with Part 2A pembrolizumab or GSK3174998 or chemotherapy or pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy or dostarlimab plus cobolimab or Bintrafusp alfa combination dose escalation phase and Part 2B expansion phase with pembrolizumab. The primary objective of the study is to determine the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose or the maximum administered dose of GSK3359609 alone or in combination.

GSK3359609 is an anti-Inducible T cell Co-Stimulator (ICOS) receptor agonist antibody intended for the treatment of cancers of different histology. This is a first-time-in-human (FTIH), open-label, multicenter study designed to investigate the safety, pharmacology, and preliminary antitumor activity in participants with selected, advanced or recurrent solid tumors with the aim to establish recommended dose(s) of GSK3359609 for further exploration as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab or chemotherapy regimens. The study is comprised of two primary parts, each composed of two phases: Part 1: GSK3359609 monotherapy with Part 1A as dose escalation phase and Part 1B as cohort expansion phase; Part 2: GSK3359609 combination therapy with Part 2A pembrolizumab or GSK3174998 or chemotherapy or pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy or dostarlimab plus cobolimab or Bintrafusp alfa combination dose escalation phase and Part 2B expansion phase with pembrolizumab. The primary objective of the study is to determine the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose or the maximum administered dose of GSK3359609 alone or in combination.
