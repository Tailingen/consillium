A Study of SHR-A1811 in Subjects With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This is an open-label, two-part study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of SHR-A1811 for injection in subjects with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who have HER2 expression , amplification, or mutation
Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: SHR-A1811
Phase 1:Incidence of Adverse Events (AEs) by CTCAE v5.0 of SHR-A1811, Assess safety and tolerability of SHR-A1811 by way of adverse events (CTCAE v5.0), From Day 1 to90 days after last dose ，appropriately to 3 years|Phase 1:Severity of Adverse Events (AEs) by CTCAE v5.0 of SHR-A1811, Assess safety and tolerability of SHR-A1811 by way of adverse events (CTCAE v5.0), From Day 1 to90 days after last dose ，appropriately to 3 years|Phase1: Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), Incidence rate and category of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) during the first 21-day cycle of SHR-A1811 treatment, 12 months|Phase 1: Recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), RP2D was determined based on the safety, tolerability, PK, immunogenicity data and efficacy information obtained, 12 months|Phase2:ObjectiveResponse Rate (ORR), As assessed by RECIST v1.1 , as assessed by independent review committee (IRC), Subjects were evaluated on tumor imaging every 6 weeks after treatment initiation and every 12 weeks after 54 weeks, until imaging progression, initiation of new antitumor therapy, loss of follow-up, and death，appropriately to 3 years
Phase 1：PK parameter ：Tmax of SHRA1811, Time to maximal concentration (Tmax) of SHR-A1811, appropriately to 3 years|Phase1:PK parameter: Cmax of SHR-A1811, Maximal concentration (Cmax) of SHR-A1811, appropriately to 3 years|Phase1:PK parameter: AUC0-t of SHR-A1811, AUC computed from time zero to the time of the last quantifiable concentration (AUC0-t) of SHR-A1811, appropriately to 3 years|Phase1:Immunogenicity of SHR-A1811, Including anti-drug antibody and/or neutralizing antibody, Immunogenicity sample collection time points include: within 30 min before administration of C1D1, C2D1, C3D1, C4D1, C6D1 and C8D1 starting from cycle 11 only in every 3 cycles ,appropriately to 3 years|Phase2:Progression Free Survival (PFS), As assessed by RECIST v1.1 , as assessed by independent review committee (IRC) and investigator, appropriately to 3 years|Phase2:ObjectiveResponse Rate (ORR), As assessed by RECIST v1.1 , as assessed by investigator, appropriately to 3 years|Phase2:Duration of response (DOR), As assessed by RECIST v1.1 , as assessed by independent review committee (IRC) and investigator, appropriately to 3 years|Phase2:Disease control rate (DCR), As assessed by RECIST v1.1 , as assessed by independent review committee (IRC) and investigator, appropriately to 3 years|Phase2:Overall survival (OS), Approximately 5 years after last subject enrolled
