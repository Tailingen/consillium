A Study of ELI-002 in Subjects With KRAS Mutated Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and Other Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1 study to assess the safety and efficacy of ELI-002 immunotherapy (a lipid-conjugated immune-stimulatory oligonucleotide \[Amph-CpG-7909\] plus a mixture of lipid-conjugated peptide-based antigens \[Amph-Peptides\]) as adjuvant treatment of minimal residual disease (MRD) in subjects with KRAS/neuroblastoma ras viral oncogene homolog (NRAS) mutated PDAC or other solid tumors.

The Participant Incidence of Treatment-emergent Adverse Events Considered by the Investigator as Related to ELI-002, The safety of ELI-002 was monitored through adverse events, including those considered related to treatment by the investigator, Adverse events were collected through 28 days after the last dose
The Proportion of Participants With Biomarker Reduction, A biomarker reduction was any decrease from baseline in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and/or serum tumor antigen levels (carbohydrate antigen 19-9 \[CA19-9\] or carcinoembryonic antigen \[CEA\])., 6 months|The Proportion of Participants With Biomarker Clearance, Biomarker clearance was defined as no detectable ctDNA, CA19-9, or CEA at post-treatment time points., 6 months|The Proportion of Participants With Biomarker Reduction by Biomarker Type, A biomarker reduction was any decrease from baseline in ctDNA and/or serum tumor antigen levels (CA19-9 or CEA)., 6 months|The Proportion of Participants With Biomarker Clearance by Biomarker Type, Biomarker clearance was defined as no detectable ctDNA, CA19-9, or CEA at post-treatment time points, 6 months
This is a Phase 1 dose escalation study in which ELI-002 2P (Amph modified KRAS peptides, Amph-G12D and Amph-G12R admixed with admixed Amph-CpG-7909) will be evaluated, with plans to transition to the ELI-002 7P drug product containing all 7 Amph-Peptides (G12D, G12R, G12V, G12A, G12C, G12S, G13D) in future clinical trials.

The study is an open-label, dose-escalation, 3+3 design in which approximately 18 subjects will be treated in 3 planned dose level cohorts. Increasing doses of Amph-CpG-7909 will be evaluated sequentially. Additional cohorts may be added to explore intermediate or higher dose levels based on cumulative safety review and preliminary review of pharmacodynamic responses. Safety and pharmacodynamic data will be evaluated and a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) will be determined in consideration of a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) if observed.
