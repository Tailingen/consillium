Intraoperative Fluorescence With Augmented Reality
This is a study looking at a new way to evaluate vascular problems or tumors in brain surgery patients using a standard \& approved intravenous dye and augmented reality.
Vascular; Lesion, Central Nervous System|Brain Tumor|Cerebral Aneurysm|Cerebral AVM
DEVICE: GLOW800|DRUG: indocyanine green (ICG)
Usefulness of Glow800 Technique, Surgeon assessment of Glow800 compared to ICG-VA in usefulness, 48 hours
Utility in Identifying a lesion, Surgeon assessment of Glow800 vs ICG-VA in identifying vascular structures (useful, somewhat useful, not useful), 48 hours|Surgical workflow, Surgeon assessment of whether there is additional time (no additional time, \<15 minutes additional time, \<30 minutes additional time, \>30 minutes additional time), 48 hours|Additional Cost, Surgeon assessment as to whether there is additional cost at surgery, 48 hours
This is a study investigating a new technique with an approved medication (ICG or indocyanine green) and using that and a near infrared mode on a standard operating room microscope to see the information provided for vascular or neoplastic (tumor related) neurosurgical problems. The technique uses the data from the microscope and using ICG with augmented reality overlaying the data into the microscope view (this is the new process). The technique is called GLOW800.
