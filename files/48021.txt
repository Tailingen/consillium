Aspirin on CTCs of Advanced Breast and Colorectal Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine whether Aspirin could affect the number and subtype of circulating tumor cells of metastatic breast cancer and colorectal cancer.
Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition|Circulating Tumor Cells
DRUG: Aspirin
Intervention completed, 2-months follow-up completed and the CTCs' assessment was evaluated three times by Canpatrol technology, the tumor burden was evaluated by MRI or CT., 2 months
Disease progression, The tumor burden would be examined by MRI or CT once a month, if we find the cancer progressed and chemotherapy is needed, the patient will be withdraw., 2 months
BACKGROUND:

* Invasion and metastasis are the main reason of death in metastatic cancer, and abundant evidence find circulating tumor cells(CTCs) take the core position in breast and colorectal cancer metastasis.
* Platelets play multiple role to facilitate the epithelial to mesenchymal transition of tumor cells and protect CTCs to survival in the circulation, which enrolled in the whole process of metastasis.
* Several clinical trials and observational study have validate the primary and secondary prevention effect of aspirin to both breast and colorectal cancer.

OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the effect of aspirin on CTC number of metastatic breast and colorectal cancer;
* Determine the effect of aspirin on CTC subtype (epithelial/mesenchymal/mixed type) of metastatic breast and colorectal cancer.

ELIGIBILITY:

* Adults age from 18-75 years old.
* Patients were diagnosed for metastatic breast or colorectal cancer by pathology.
* Patients who were not currently receiving intravenous chemotherapy , oral administrated with capecitabine was permitted. Concurrent endocrine therapy ( for at least 2 months before enrollment), bisphosphonate therapy, and/or monoclonal targeted therapy were permitted.
* No disease of hemorrhagic tendency or history of non-steroid drug allergy.
* CTCsâ‰¥5 / 7.5ml blood

STUDY DESIGN:

* Aspirin will be administered orally once a day in 28-day cycles.
* The CTC was evaluated every 28 days for 2 months.
