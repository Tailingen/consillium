Safety, Dose Tolerance, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics Study of CPX-POM in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a first-in-human, Phase I, multicenter, open label, dose escalation study to evaluate the DLTs and MTD and to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of CPX-POM administered IV in patients with any histologically- or cytologically-confirmed solid tumor type.

DRUG: CPX-POM - 30 mg/m^2|DRUG: CPX-POM - 60 mg/m^2|DRUG: CPX-POM - 120 mg/m^2|DRUG: CPX-POM - 240 mg/m^2|DRUG: CPX-POM - 360 mg/m^2|DRUG: CPX-POM - 600 mg/m^2|DRUG: CPX-POM - 900 mg/m^2|DRUG: CPX-POM - 1200 mg/m^2
Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) of CPX-POM, The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) of ciclopirox phosphoryloxymethyl ester (CPX-POM) administered intravenously (IV) and establish the CPX POM dose recommended for further investigation.

A DLT will include some Grade 3 or 4 AEs (as assessed by CTCAE version 4.03) if deemed related to study drug. In addition, any patient who is unable to receive 80% of the expected dose of CPX-POM (i.e., patients who are unable to receive at least 4 of the 5 scheduled doses) because of AEs will be considered to have a DLT.

In order to identify any DLTs, safety assessments including AEs, physical examinations, vital signs, and clinical laboratory tests will be conducted during each study visit through Day 22., Up to 22 days for each cohort|Determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of CPX-POM, The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ciclopirox phosphoryloxymethyl ester (CPX-POM) administered intravenously (IV) and establish the CPX POM dose recommended for further investigation. MTD was determined by testing increasing doses up to 1200 mg/m\^2 by IV.

The MTD is defined as the dose BELOW that dose which causes DLTs in ≥33% of patients., Days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 22 and 28

The study will initially employ an accelerated escalation design, with a single patient enrolled in each cohort (i.e., Single-Patient Cohorts). The initial patient will receive CPX-POM at a starting dose of 30 mg/m2. Doses will be escalated (doubling), until a ≥Grade 2 toxicity (with the exception of alopecia), is encountered. Subsequently that and all subsequent cohorts will follow a classical "3+3" dose escalation design.

Note: Fosciclopirox is the generic name for CPX-POM.
