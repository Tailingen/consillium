The purpose of the study is to find some biomarkers to predict the the adverse events of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors monotherapy or plus platinum based chemotherapy in lung cancer.

Step 1: All the lung cancer patients treated with Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors monotherapy or plus platinum based chemotherapy were enrolled in this study.

Step 2: All the adverse events were evaluated by principal investigator. Step 3: All the blood and FFPE samples were collected for further anaysis. Step 4: Correlation between adverse events and gene profile was analysis. Step 4: Predict model was construted with AI.
