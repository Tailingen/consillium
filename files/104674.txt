Esophageal Sparing Intensity-modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) for Locally-Advanced Thoracic Malignancies
Hypothesis 1- Using IMRT, the radiation therapy (RT) dose can be safely escalated from 58 Gy to 74 Gy given as 6 fractions/week with concurrent chemotherapy.

Hypothesis 2- Esophageal motion can be used to customize planning organ at risk volumes.

Hypothesis 3- Biological predictors of acute esophagitis can be used to identify patients at high risk of developing esophageal toxicity from radiation therapy and chemotherapy.

RADIATION: Esophageal sparing IMRT
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of IMRT, within 30 days of completing RT
The occurrence of RT-induced acute esophagitis, One year|To determine if biological predictors of esophagitis can identify patients who develop severe esophageal toxicity during radiation therapy, Blood will be drawn at specific time intervals, plasma will be analysed for Glutathione Oxidation, Citrulline, Lipid peroxidation, DNA oxidation, and Tetrahydrobiopterin., Two years
Prospective phase I study designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose of radiation therapy given in an accelerated fashion (2 Gy/fraction, 6 fractions/week) with concurrent chemotherapy. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) will be utilized to spare the esophagus. All patients on the dose escalation study will participate in additional assessments evaluating esophageal motion and esophageal toxicity from radiation therapy.
