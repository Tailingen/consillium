A Study of Increasing Strengths, Safety and Efficacy of Two Formulas of LEO 43204 on the Face or the Chest in Patients With Actinic Keratosis
Part 1:

To identify Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) levels of two formulations of LEO 43204 after once daily treatment for two consecutive days

Part 2:

To evaluate efficacy of two formulations of LEO 43204 in two doses after once daily treatment for two consecutive days compared to vehicle formulations

Part 1: Number of Participants Experiencing a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) Based on Local Skin Responses (LSRs), The number of participants experiencing DLTs are tabulated by treatment group. This was used to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of LEO 43204 after once daily treatment for 2 consecutive days.The MTD was defined as the highest dose level with less than 4 out of 12 participants(cohorts 1 to 4) or less than 6 out of 18 participants(cohorts 5 and 6) experiencing a DLT

DLT was defined as one or more of the following 3 LSRs:

* Crusting Grade 4
* Erosion/Ulceration Grade 4
* Vesiculation/Pustulation Grade 4

or two or more of the following five LSRs:

* Erythema Grade 4
* Crusting Grade 3
* Swelling Grade 4
* Erosion/Ulceration Grade 3
* Vesiculation/Pustulation Grade 3

The Local Skin Responses consists of the following 6 categories: Erythema, flaking/scaling, crusting, swelling, vesiculation/pustulation, erosion/ulceration. Each individual LSR category are given a numeric grade of severity from 0-4. Grade 0 being no presence and 4 being the highest grade of severity., From Day 1 up to and including Day 8|Part 2: Percent Reduction From Baseline in Actinic Keratosis (AK) Counts (Multiple Imputation), At Week 8
Part 2: Percentage of Participants With Complete Clearance of Actinic Keratosis Lesions (AKs) (Multiple Imputation), Complete clearance was defined as a 100% reduction from baseline in AK count. For treatment groups Vehicle, 0.006 and 0.012 the table shows the percentage of mean number of participants across imputations with complete clearance. For treatment group 0.018 the table shows the percentage of mean number of participants with complete clearance in observed cases., At Week 8|Part 2: Percentage of Participants With Partial Clearance of AKs (Multiple Imputation), Partial clearance was defined as at least 75% reduction from baseline in AK count.

For treatment groups Vehicle, 0.006 and 0.012 the table shows the percentage of mean number of participants across imputations with partial clearance. For treatment group 0.018 the table shows the percentage of mean number of participants with partial clearance in observed cases., At Week 8
