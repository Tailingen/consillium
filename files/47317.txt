A Phase II Study of Neoadjuvant Sacituzumab Govitecan and Pembrolizumab Therapy for Immunochemotherapy-resistant Early-stage Triple-negative Breast Cancer (TNBC)
To learn if sacituzumab govitecan and pembrolizumab, when given before surgery, can help to control early-stage triple negative breast cancer that has not responded well to other treatments.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Sacituzumab Govitecan|DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, through study completion; an average of 1 year.
Primary Objective:

• To determine the efficacy of sacituzumab govitecan and pembrolizumab combination treatment on pathological complete response (pCR)/residual cancer burden (RCB)-1 in the patients with early-stage TNBC who showed a resistance to the combination of immunochemotherapy.

Secondary Objectives:

* To determine the safety of the proposed combination treatment.
* To determine the objective overall response rate (ORR) of the proposed treatment.
* To determine the distant-recurrence-free survival (DRFS).
* To determine the 3-year event-free survival (EFS) rate.
* To determine the 3-year overall survival (OS) rate.

Exploratory Objective:

• To investigate the response biomarkers in the tumor tissues and peripheral blood.
