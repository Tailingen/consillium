This study is an open-label, multi-centric, phase II study designed to evaluate the efficacy of Tafasitamab and Lenalinomide associated to Rituximab in elderly patients with frontline Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma as assessed by the Overall Response Rate (ORR) after 3 cycles of treatment according to Lugano Response Criteria.

After a screening phase, eligible patients will be enrolled and start the prephase treatment with vincristine and prednisone before day 1 of cycle 1 of the experimental drugs.

Patients with Progressive Disease or Stable Disease after 3 cycles should start a conventional chemotherapy (R-miniCHOP) at Investigator's discretion and will remain in the study.
