RElugolix VErsus LeUprolide Cardiac Trial
This clinical trial investigates the impact of prostate cancer treatment, specifically androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), on the heart and coronary vessels among men with localized, non-metastatic prostate cancer undergoing definitive radiation therapy and concomitant ADT. Recently, cardiovascular toxicity from hormone therapy that is routinely used for prostate cancer (e.g. leuprolide) has emerged as a concern, yet studies identifying who is at risk and the mechanism of cardiac damage are lacking. Additionally, a new hormone therapy drug, relugolix, has recently been Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved and may reduce toxicity to the heart. This trial intends to investigate the mechanism of cardiovascular toxicity from ADT, investigate the mechanism by which relugolix reduces cardiovascular toxicity, and identify predictive biomarkers to improve individualized risk-assessment for cardiovascular toxicity from ADT.

Total coronary plaque volume in major coronary arteries (i.e. left anterior descending, left circumflex, right major coronary arteries), Using cardiac computed tomography angiography (CCTA), total coronary plaque volume will be determined using an artificial intelligence-enabled quantitative coronary plaque analysis (AI-QCPA) through a commercially available and validated software service (HeartFlow, Inc). Each coronary artery (right coronary, left main, left anterior descending, and left circumflex) will be scored, and plaque volumes were summed over all segments., From baseline to 12 months post-treatment initiation
Non-calcified coronary plaque volume in major coronary arteries (i.e. left anterior descending, left circumflex, right major coronary arteries), Using cardiac computed tomography angiography (CCTA), total coronary plaque volume will be determined using an artificial intelligence-enabled quantitative coronary plaque analysis (AI-QCPA) through a commercially available and validated software service (HeartFlow, Inc). Each coronary artery (right coronary, left main, left anterior descending, and left circumflex) will be scored, and plaque volumes were summed over all segments., From baseline to 12 months post-treatment initiation
Calcified and low-attenuation coronary plaque volume in major coronary arteries (i.e. left anterior descending, left circumflex, right major coronary arteries), Using cardiac computed tomography angiography (CCTA), total coronary plaque volume will be determined using an artificial intelligence-enabled quantitative coronary plaque analysis (AI-QCPA) through a commercially available and validated software service (HeartFlow, Inc). Each coronary artery (right coronary, left main, left anterior descending, and left circumflex) will be scored, and plaque volumes were summed over all segments., From baseline to 12 months post-treatment initiation|Coronary artery calcium score (CACS), The CACS will be measured by the Agatston score (range 0-400, with higher scores indicating more coronary artery calcium) on precontrast cardiac computed tomography anigiography (CCTA) scans by two blinded, board-certified cardiologists., From baseline to 12 months post-treatment initiation|Coronary vessel stenosis, Using cardiac computed tomography angiography (CCTA) images, an artificial intelligence-informed coronary stenosis quantification tool (AI-CSQ, Roadmap Analysis, Heartflow, Mountain View CA) will be used, which provides a quantitative analysis of coronary artery disease severity and location using a combination of deep learning techniques and human expert review and correction. Stenoses regions are defined in ranges of 0%-29%, 30%-49%, 50%-69%, 70%-99%, or total occlusion. The maximum stenosis of all coronary territories was quantified on a per-patient basis., From baseline to 12 months post-treatment initiation|Major adverse cardiovascular events, Incidence of myocardial infarction, need for coronary revascularization, and/or sudden cardiac death will be measured for up to 2 years following enrollment., From baseline to at least 2 years post-treatment initiation|Testosterone kinetics, Change in total testosterone levels (ng/dL) will be measured at baseline and month 0, 3, 6, and 12 between treatment arms. Testosterone change over time will be summarized and plotted over time for each treatment arm., Baseline and month 0, 3, 6, 12
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Identify and compare the association of gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GNRH)-agonist leuprolide versus GNRH-antagonist relugolix with coronary atherosclerosis and progression in men with prostate cancer.

II. Determine the relationship between leuprolide versus relugolix with downstream immune effector response that is implicated in atherosclerosis.

II. Determine how pre-existing genomic alterations associated with proinflammatory immunity impact development of CV toxicity following GNRH-agonist (GNRHa) versus relugolix.

III. Identify imaging biomarkers associated with increased risk of CV toxicity from ADT

OUTLINE: Patients undergoing radiation therapy alone as part of their standard treatment are assigned to Arm I. Patients undergoing radiation therapy and ADT as part of their standard treatment are randomized to Arm II or Arm III.

ARM I: Patients undergo definitive radiation therapy in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

ARM II: Patients undergo radiation therapy as in Arm I and receive leuprolide subcutaneously (SC) or intramuscularly (IM) every 3 or 6 months. Treatment continues for 6 to 24 months (depending on cancer risk) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

ARM III: Patients undergo radiation therapy as in Arm I and receive relugolix orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 6 to 24 months (depending on risk) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
