Surgical Management of Multiple Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma and Adenocarcinoma
A case series of patient having mucoepidermoid carcinoma, had standard treatment protocol and surgeries and followup was performed and the patient postoperative quality of life and recurrent rate was recorded
Adenocarcinoma; Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: resection of mucoeidermoid carcinoma
Quality of life, in grades the quality of life of patients is assessed by visual analogue scale in a scale from 1-10. higher values indicates better quality of life, 6 months
This case series presents mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Palatal mass was resected with safety margin then immediate opturator inserted; superficial parotidectomy was also done for parotid lesion sparing facial nerve. Post-operative radiotherapy was recommended by pathologist due to evident perineural spread. The patient is tumor free after one year follow-up.

Clinical reports about synchronous multiple salivary tumors are very rare, consequently there is little known about its management and clinical presentation. Presence of one or more risk factor should favor expectation of multiple tumors and mandate examination of all salivary tissues. Each tumor should be diagnosed and treated separately according to its nature and extension.
