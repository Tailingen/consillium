Individualized Nutritional Counselling During Chemotherapy for Colorectal Cancer (COLONUT)
The purpose is to study the effect of individualized nutritional counselling compared to usual nutritional care on cross-sectional muscle area in patients with stage IV colorectal cancer during first line chemotherapy. Secondary, effect on total lean body mass, treatment intensity, physical functioning, quality of life and survival will be studied.We hypothesize that patients in the intervention arm benefit from individualized nutritional counseling.
Stage IV Colorectal Cancer
PROCEDURE: Nutritional counseling
Change in skeletal muscle area (cm2) between individualized nutritional counselling versus usual nutritional care, will be measured with SliceOmatic software V5.0 (Tomovision) with use of routinely conducted CT scans for diagnostic and disease evaluation purposes, During 9 weeks of first line chemotherapy
Change in total body lean body mass and segmental lean body mass (DEXA) in patients with stage IV colorectal cancer during 9 weeks of first line chemotherapy between individualized nutritional counseling versus usual nutritional care, During 9 weeks of first line chemotherapy|Change in skeletal muscle area in patients with stage IV colorectal cancer during 20 weeks of first line chemotherapy between individualized nutritional counseling.versus usual nutritional care., Change in skeletal muscle area (cm2) between individualized nutritional counselling versus usual nutritional care, During 20 weeks of first line chemotherapy|Composite of treatment toxicity, treatment intensity, treatment outcome, survival, physical functioning, quality of life and hand grip strength of both study arms, During 9 weeks and during 20 weeks of first line chemotherapy|Associations of (changes in) muscle area with (changes in) mid-upper arm muscle circumference, whole body fat free mass (BIA) and whole body lean body mass (DEXA)., During 9 weeks of first line chemotherapy
