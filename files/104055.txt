Testing Experimental Anti-cancer Drug SLC-391 with an Approved Immunotherapy Drug, Pembrolizumab, for Advanced Lung Cancers
SLC-391 is a novel, potent and specific small molecule inhibitor of receptor tyrosine kinase AXL with desirable potency and pharmaceutical properties.

The study is being done to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of SLC-391 in combination with pembrolizumab in participants with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Each treatment cycle lasts 21 days. Participants will swallow SLC-391 pills two times every day. Participants will get pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) from the study site staff on the first day of every cycle.

This study has 2 parts. The first part will determine the recommended dose of SLC-391 in combination with pembrolizumab. The second part wants to find out if the combination of SLC-391 and pembrolizumab can help stop NSCLC tumours from growing or spreading.

Phase 1b: Determine doses of SLC-391 in combination with pembrolizumab for further evaluation in Phase 2a., After a minimum of 3 evaluable subjects have completed the 21-day DLT (Dose Limiting Toxicity) evaluation period, SRC will review all available safety, efficacy, PK, and pharmacodynamic data and determine whether to expand the current dose level or escalate or de-escalate.

A subject is considered "evaluable" for dose-decisions during Phase 1b if the subject has completed the 21-day DLT evaluation period and has received at least 75% of the planned dose of study drug during the DLT evaluation period, or the subject has experienced a DLT. The number of subjects experiencing a DLT will inform the SRC's decision on whether to expand, escalate or de-escalate.
