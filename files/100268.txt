Sitravatinib With or Without Tislelizumab in Patients With Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma
In 2014, an estimated 7,000 patients were diagnosed of melanoma in China. It is growing at an annual rate of 3%-5% and approximately 20,000 new cases are reported each year recently.To date, CFDA only approved dacarbazine as first line chemotherapy and anti-PD-1 antibody monotherapy as second line. There is no standard of care after chemotherapy and anti-PD-1.

This is an open-label, randomized, single center phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of sitravatinib in combination with tislelizumab for Chinese patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma after disease progression from prior anti-PD-1 antibody and chemotherapy. The first 20 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either sitravatinib plus tislelizumab (Arm A) or sitravatinb monotherapy (Arm B). After the completion of initial 20 patients, additional patients will be recruited until 24 efficacy evaluable patients achieved in Arm A
