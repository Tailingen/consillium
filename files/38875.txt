A Pilot Trial With Subcutaneous Alemtuzumab and Oral Fludarabinephosphate for the Determination of Safety, Efficacy and Molecular Profiling for the Prediction of Response
Open label multicenter, two-step, non-randomized (pilot) study to analyze the safety of 4 cycles of 3-day 40mg/m2 oral fludarabine with simultaneous thrice weekly application of 30mg alemtuzumab s.c. in patients with B-CLL disease in 1st and 2nd relapse after any primary treatment or with disease refractory to any therapy in 1st or 2nd line (including Fludarabine, ). This regimen is preceded by an escalation phase with 3-10-30 mg of alemtuzumab s.c.

After the first phase (completed treatment of 7 patients) an interim analysis of safety and efficacy will be performed. In case of a sufficient risk benefit assessment followed by the enrollment of further 21 patients. Final analysis of safety and preliminary efficacy will be based on all patients enrolled.
