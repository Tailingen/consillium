Effects of a CT-100 DiNaMo Component on Cognitive Functioning and Mood Symptoms
CT-100 is a platform that provides an interactive, software based therapeutic component that may be used as part of a multimodal treatment in supplementary or standalone prescription or nonprescription software-based digital therapeutics (PDT/DTx), being developed by Click Therapeutics, Inc.

PROMIS Item Bank v2.0 - Cognitive Function - Short Form 8a (PROMIS-CF), Change in cognitive functioning as measured by PROMIS Item Bank v2.0 - Cognitive Function - Short Form 8a (PROMIS-CF) in the Study App intervention group compared to a Care-As-Usual control group; 8 items, from minimum of 8 (worst) to maximum of 40 (best), Baseline (Day 1) corrected change of intervention vs, Care-As-Usual on Day 21
Patient-reported Quality-of-Life (QoL) as measured by the PROMIS-29 in the Study App intervention group compared to a Care-As-Usual control group, To explore changes in patient-reported Quality-of-Life (QoL) as measured by the PROMIS-29 in the Study App intervention group compared to a Care-As-Usual control group; 29 items across mood (2 domains), physical function, pain interference, fatigue, sleep disturbance, ability to participate in social roles and activities and cognitive function on a scale of 1 (worst) to 5 (best), and pain intensity (on a scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable)., Baseline (Day 1) corrected change of intervention vs, Care-As-Usual on Day 21|Global Rating of Change (GRC-Cognition and GRC-Mood), Treatment impact reported at week 3 as measured by Global Rating of Change (GRC-Cognition and GRC-Mood) in the Study App intervention group compared to a Care-As-Usual control group; -5 (worst), 0 unchanged, 5 (best - recovered), Baseline (Day 1) corrected change of intervention vs, Care-As-Usual on Day 21|Changes in indication-specific measures of Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) in Multiple Sclerosis (only), To explore changes in indication-specific measures of Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) in the Study App intervention group compared to a Care-As-Usual control group in in Multiple Sclerosis.

For SDMT, scoring involves summing the number of correct substitutions within the 90 second interval, minimum: 0 (worst), max: 110 (best)., Baseline (Day 1) corrected change of intervention vs, Care-As-Usual on Day 21|Changes in indication-specific measures of Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive (FACT-Cog) in Cancer (Breast/Lung; only)., To explore changes in indication-specific measures of Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive (FACT-Cog) in the Study App intervention group compared to a Care-As-Usual control group in Cancer (Breast/Lung).

For FACT-Cog, scoring involves 37-item Likert-scaled questionnaire with responses ranging from 0 to 4 and consisting of four subscales (Perceived Cognitive Impairments, Perceived Cognitive Abilities, Impact on Quality Of Life, Comments From Others). Higher scores are better (better functioning or quality of life): minimum 0 (worst), maximum 4 (best)., Baseline (Day 1) corrected change of intervention vs. Care-As-Usual on Day 21
CT-100 is a platform that provides an interactive, software based therapeutic component (CT-100-001) that may be used as part of a multimodal treatment in future prescription or non-prescription software-based digital therapeutics (PDT/DTx). CT-100-001 contains a class of Digital Neuro-activation and Modulation (DiNaMo) component. This DiNaMo component targets key neural systems (including, but not limited to, systems related to cognitive control, sensory-, perceptual-, affective-, pain-, attention-, social-, and self-processing) to optimally improve patients' cognitive and mental health. The CT-100-001 DiNaMo component is designed to improve cognitive impairments and mood challenges.

The purpose of the proposed basket study is to evaluate the initial effects of the CT-100-001, a DiNaMo component (the Study App) on cognitive functioning and related outcomes compared to Care-As-Usual across several non-DSM-5 indications. These indications have known high prevalence of cognitive impairments due to the illness and/or treatments. such as in Multiple Sclerosis, Breast or Lung Cancer, and Mild Cognitive Impairment.
