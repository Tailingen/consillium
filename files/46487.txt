A Study of AK104 Plus Axitinib in Advanced/Metastatic Special Pathological Subtypes of Renal Cell Carcinoma
This is a Phase Ib/II, open-label, single arm trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AK104 in combination with axitinib as a first-line treatment for advanced/metastatic special pathological subtypes of renal cell carcinoma (ssRCC). Subjects will receive AK104 plus axitinib until disease progression, development of unacceptable toxic effects, death, a decision by the physician or patient to withdraw from the trial. The primary endpoint is ORR and PFS per RECIST v1.1 and imRECIST as assessed by investigators.
Renal Cell Carcinoma|First-line Treatment|Non Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma|Sarcomatoid Renal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: AK104|DRUG: Axitinib
ORR per RECIST v1.1 and imRECIST as assessed by investigators, ORR is the proportion of subjects with complete response(CR) or partial response(PR) , based on RECIST v1.1 and imRECIST, 3 years
DCR per RECIST v1.1 and imRECIST as assessed by investigators, ORR is the proportion of subjects with complete response(CR), partial response(PR) or stable disease (SD) based on RECIST v1.1 and imRECIST, 3 years|OS, OS is the time from the first use of a therapeutic drug to death from any cause, 3 years|PFS per RECIST v1.1 and imRECIST as assessed by investigators, PFS is the time from the first use of a therapeutic drug to disease progression or death from any cause, progression is assessed by investigators based on RECIST v1.1 and imRECIST, 3 years|Life quality Questionnaire composite, Evaluate life quality using EuroQol Five Dimensions Questionnaire (EQ-5D). EQ-5D included two aspects: EQ-5D Descriptive System and the EQ-5D visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS).

In the description system, health status will be evaluated in 5 aspects: Mobility, Self-care, Usual Activities, Pain/Discomfort, Anxiety/Depression.

EQ-VAS ranges from 0 to 100, higher scores indicate better health., 3 years|Pain score, Evaluate pain using visual analogue scale (VAS), range from 0 to 10, higher scores predict a poor prognosis., 3 years
Treatment-related adverse events, Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, also types and degree, 3 years
