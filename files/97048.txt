A Study Of Multiple Immunotherapy-Based Treatment Combinations In Participants With Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (Morpheus- Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer)
This study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of immunotherapy-based treatment combinations in participants with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Two cohorts will be enrolled in parallel in this study: Cohort 1 will consist of participants with tumor PD-L1 expression who have received no prior systemic therapy for metastatic NSCLC, and Cohort 2 will consist of participants who experienced disease progression during or following treatment with a platinum-containing regimen and a PD-L1/PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor, given in combination as one line of therapy or as two separate lines of therapy, regardless of PD-L1 expression. In each cohort, eligible participants will initially be assigned to one of several treatment arms (Stage 1). Participants who experience disease progression, loss of clinical benefit, or unacceptable toxicity during Stage 1 may be eligible to continue treatment with a different treatment regimen (Stage 2).
