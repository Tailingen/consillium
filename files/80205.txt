Zimberelimab and Domvanalimab in Combination With Chemotherapy Versus Pembrolizumab With Chemotherapy in Patients With Untreated Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
The primary objective of this study is to compare the effect of zimberelimab (ZIM) and domvanalimab (DOM) in combination with chemotherapy relative to pembrolizumab (PEMBRO) in combination with chemotherapy on overall survival (OS) in patients with untreated metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with no actionable genomic alteration.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Zimberelimab|DRUG: Domvanalimab|DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Nab-paclitaxel|DRUG: Pemetrexed
Overall Survival (OS) in Participants With Positive Programmed Cell Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) Expression (â‰¥1%Tumor Cells) and in all Randomized Participants., OS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause., Up to 68 months
Progression-free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1, PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization until disease progression (PD) or death from any cause, whichever comes first., Upt to 50 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR) as Assessed by BICR per RECIST Version 1.1, ORR is defined as the proportion of participants who have achieved a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) that is confirmed at least 4 weeks later., Up to 50 Months|Duration of Response (DOR) as Assessed by BICR per RECIST Version 1.1, DOR is defined as the time from the first response (CR or PR), to the first documented PD or death from any cause, whichever comes first., Up to 50 Months|Percentage of Participants Experiencing Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), First dose date up to 50 months plus 30 days|Percentage of Participants Experiencing Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities, First dose date up to 50 months plus 30 days|Time to First Symptom Deterioration in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Symptom Assessment Questionnaire (NSCLC-SAQ) Total Score, The NSCLC-SAQ is a patient reported outcome measure with seven items assessing five symptom concepts of NSCLC: cough, pain, dyspnea, fatigue, and appetite. Each item is rated using a five-point verbal rating scale from "No \<symptom\> At All" to "Very severe \<symptom\>" or from "Never to Always," corresponding to a score of 0 to 4. The sum of all 5 domain scores will be computed, if any scores are missing, a total score will not be computed. The total score ranges between 0 and 20 with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms., Baseline, Up to 50 Months
