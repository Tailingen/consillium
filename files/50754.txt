A Study of DCLL9718S in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) or DCLL9718S in Combination With Azacitidine in Participants With Previously Untreated AML Unsuitable for Intensive Induction Chemotherapy
This Phase Ia/Ib, open-label, multicenter study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of DCLL9718S as a single agent (Phase Ia, Arm A) in participants with relapsed or refractory AML or in combination with azacitidine (Phase Ib, Arm B) in participants with previously untreated AML who are not eligible for intensive induction chemotherapy. Each arm will consist of two stages: a dose-escalation stage and an expansion stage. The dose-escalation stage is designed to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) for DCLL9718S alone (Arm A) or in combination with azacitidine (Arm B). The dose-expansion stage is designed to characterize the long-term safety and tolerability of DCLL9718S.
