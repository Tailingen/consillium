Lenvatinib vs Bevacizumab Plus ICIs and HAIC in Unresectable HCC
Previous studies had suggested hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and anti-angiogenic drugs had promising anti-tumor activity in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Two kinds of anti-angiogenic drugs (tyrosine kinase inhibitors \[lenvatinib\] and anti-VEGF antibody \[bevacizumab\]) were applied in first-line treatment of unresectable HCC. However, little is known about the difference of efficacy and safety between lenvatinib (LenHAP) or bevacizumab (BevHAP) combined with ICIs and HAIC in unresectable HCC.
