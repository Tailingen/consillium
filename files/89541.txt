A Study of TQB2930 for Injection Monotherapy or Combination Therapy in Patients With Recurrent/Metastatic Breast Cancer
This is a phase Ib/II exploratory study. Phase Ib includes the dose escalation and expansion study of monotherapy, as well as the dose escalation study of combination therapy. After determining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), a dose expansion study is conducted to observe the safety and efficacy in monotherapy. Phase II study is to further observe the safety and efficacy of TQB2930 combined with albumin-paclitaxel (cohort 3), or chemotherapy selected by investigators (cohort 4).
