Partial Breast Radiation Therapy in Treating Women Undergoing Breast-Conserving Therapy for Early Stage Breast Cancer
RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays and other types of radiation to kill tumor cells. Giving radiation therapy in different ways may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well partial breast radiation therapy works in treating women undergoing breast-conserving therapy for early stage breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: adjuvant therapy|RADIATION: 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy|RADIATION: brachytherapy
Cosmetic outcome as determined by an established scale employed by the radiation oncologist and the surgeon, 1 month after RT & Q3mos for one year|Patient satisfaction with partial breast irradiation as measured by a questionnaire, Pre-treatment 1 mo 3 mo 6 mo 9 mo 1yr 5 yr|Wound healing and overall complication rate after partial breast irradiation, 1 month after RT & Q3mos for one year|Determination of which patients are best suited for each individual technique of partial breast irradiation, Patients will be followed for a period of five years following completion of radiation.|Ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence rates and tumor bed recurrence rates, Ipsilateral breast 6 mos after dx, bilateral annually x 5 years
OBJECTIVES:

* To determine the cosmetic outcome resulting from partial breast irradiation using two different techniques.
* To determine patient satisfaction with partial breast irradiation as it pertains to their overall treatment experience as measured by a questionnaire.
* To determine if there are patient factors that limit a patient's suitability to receive partial breast irradiation delivered by a particular technique.
* To evaluate wound healing and overall complication rate after partial breast irradiation.
* To determine ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence rates and tumor bed recurrence rates.

OUTLINE: Patients undergo partial breast irradiation comprising either MammoSiteÂ® brachytherapy twice daily for 5-10 days OR 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy twice daily for 5-10 days.

After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years.
