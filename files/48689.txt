Bortezomib and Sorafenib Tosylate in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This randomized phase III trial studies how well bortezomib and sorafenib tosylate work in treating patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia. Bortezomib and sorafenib tosylate may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving bortezomib and sorafenib tosylate together with combination chemotherapy may be an effective treatment for acute myeloid leukemia.
