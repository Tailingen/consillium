The Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of HX301 Monolactate Capsules in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
Open label, single- and multiple-dose administration, dose-exploratory clinical phase I study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and PK profile of HX301 monolactate capsules in patients with advanced malignant solid tumors and to preliminarily evaluate its antitumor efficacy.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: HX301
Incidence of adverse events (AE) in HX301 Monolactate Capsules in patients with advanced solid tumors, Adverse events (AEs) determined by the investigator are recorded and graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE - Version 5.0)., Collected adverse events from first dosing through at least 30 days after the end of treatment, or until other cancer treatment regimens have been started (whichever occurs earlier)|Incidence of Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT) in HX301 Monolactate Capsules in patients with advanced solid tumors, Incidence of Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT) that would result in stopping dosing, 7 days after single dose (C0D1-C0D7) and 4 weeks after first dose of multiple dose (C1D1-C1D28).
Pharmacokinetics (PK): Maximum plasma concentration of drug (Cmax), Highest concentration of drug measured in the PK samples, Single dose : Cycle 0 Day 1 and multiple dose : Cycle 1 Day 1,Cycle 1 Day 8,Cycle 1 Day 9,Cycle 1 Day 15 (each cycle is 28 days)|Pharmacokinetics(PK): Time to reach Cmax (Tmax), Time from dosing until collection of the PK samples with the highest drug concentration., Single dose : Cycle 0 Day 1 and multiple dose : Cycle 1 Day 1,Cycle 1 Day 8,Cycle 1 Day 9,Cycle 1 Day 15 (each cycle is 28 days)|Terminal Half-life （t½）of HX301, Terminal phase elimination half-life, Single dose : Cycle 0 Day 1 and multiple dose : Cycle 1 Day 1,Cycle 1 Day 8,Cycle 1 Day 9,Cycle 1 Day 15 (each cycle is 28 days)|Area Under the Serum Concentration-time Curve (AUC), The area under the serum concentration-time curve ., Single dose : Cycle 0 Day 1 and multiple dose : Cycle 1 Day 1,Cycle 1 Day 8,Cycle 1 Day 9,Cycle 1 Day 15 (each cycle is 28 days)|Objective response rate (ORR) of HX301 Monolactate Capsules in patients with solid tumors, The ORR is defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who had a confirmed Complete Response or Partial Response., Approximately 1 years|Duration of response (DoR) of HX301 Monolactate Capsules in patients with solid tumors, The DoR is defined as the time from the first recorded response (CR or PR) to the first recorded tumor progression or death due to any cause., Approximately 1 years|Progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with solid tumors treated with HX301, The PFS is defined as the time from the start of the first dose to the first documented disease progression or death of any cause., Approximately 1 years
The study is divided into a screening period (28 days before first dose), treatment period, and follow-up period.

In the dose escalation stage, the study will follow a 3+3 dose-escalation scheme enrolling cohorts of at least 3 subjects sequentially at escalating doses. The dose escalation phase includes a single-dose phase and a multiple-dose phase. Subjects in the single-dose phase were treated with HX301monolactate, taken orally before breakfast, and in the multiple-dose phase, the frequency of administration was once daily (QD), 3 weeks continuously, suspended for 1 week, and every 4 weeks (28 days) was a dosing cycle. Dose escalation will continue until identification of an MTD or the maximum dose is reached. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) will be assessed from the first dose of study treatment until 28 days. Blood samples will be collected at regular intervals for pharmacokinetics (PK).

The Tumor evaluation (assessed by the Investigator in accordance with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 \[RECIST 1.1\] to assess efficacy will start from the first dose and occur every 8 weeks in the first 24 weeks and every 12 weeks thereafter.

After 1 year of treatment, if the sponsor and investigator determine that the subject can still benefit from treatment with HX301, the treatment may continue until the disease progresses, the investigator determines that the subject is no longer suitable for further treatment, the subject voluntarily withdraws from the treatment, or the sponsor withdraws the trial.
