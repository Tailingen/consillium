Patritumab With Cetuximab and a Platinum Agent for Squamous Cell Carcinoma (Cancer) of the Head and Neck (SCCHN )
This study will test an investigational study drug called patritumab. It is a 'randomized study' which means participants have an equal chance of being assigned to receive the experimental medication (patritumab) or a substance that looks like the experimental product, but is not (placebo). Patritumab may work when combined with other medications that are approved for the treatment of head and neck cancer. They are called cetuximab, cisplatin or carboplatin. All participants will receive the other medications approved for treatment of head and neck cancer, even if they do not receive the experimental product.
Head and Neck Neoplasms
DRUG: Patritumab|DRUG: Cetuximab|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Placebo
Progression Free Survival (PFS) in the Heregulin (HRG)-High Expression Population, PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first radiographic disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever comes first.

Median PFS is from Kaplan-Meier analysis. Confidence interval (CI) for median was computed using Brookmeyer-Crowley method., from Day 0 to end of active study (study termination) - within 12 months
Median Overall Survival, Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from the date of randomization to death due to any cause, at approximately 25 months|Percentage of Participants With Best Overall Response, Best overall response rate (ORR) is defined as the percentage of participants with Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR), at approximately 22 months
Main objective of the trial:

The main objective of the trial is to evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) in the heregulin (HRG) high expression population from subjects treated with patritumab + cetuximab + platinum-based therapy compared to placebo + cetuximab + platinum-based therapy.
