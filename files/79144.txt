Evaluation of Carboplatin Plus Gemcitabine Followed by Concomitant Chemoradiation for Non-resectable Stage III NSCLC
The aim of this study is to evaluate whether by combining a carboplatin-gemcitabine based induction chemotherapy with weekly cisplatin during standard thoracic radiotherapy it is possible to obtain optimal efficacy with minimal toxicity. Patients will be treated with 3 cycles of induction chemotherapy, unless there is the occurrence of early intrathoracic progression of disease. The induction chemotherapy is then to be followed by chemo-radiotherapy.
