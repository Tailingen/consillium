Cadonilimab + FOLFOX Versus FOLFOX in the Neoadjuvant Treatment of pMMR/MSS Locally Advanced Colorectal Cancer
The goal of this clinical trial is to compare the efficacy and safety of the combination of Cadonilimab and FOLFOX regimen compared to FOLFOX regimen alone in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy of pMMR/MSS locally advanced colorectal cancer. The main question aims to answer are:

Question 1: Compare the pathological complete response rate between the combination of Cadonilimab and FOLFOX regimen and the FOLFOX alone.

Question 2: Compare the survival outcomes and safety between the combination of Cadonilimab and FOLFOX regimen and the FOLFOX alone.

Two groups of participants will receive different new adjuvant chemotherapy regimens, and their efficacy will be compared.
Locally Advanced Colorectal Carcinoma
DRUG: Cadonilimab|DRUG: FOLFOX regimen
pCR rate, pathological complete response rate, at time of surgery
R0 resection rate, R0 resection rate, at time of surgical assessment (after 3 cycles), up to 12 months|DFS, disease-free survival, up to 3 years after intervention|3 years DFS rate, 3 years DFS rate, 3 years|OS, overall survival, at 1,2,3 years at follow-up time
adverse event adverse event rate, adverse event, 90 days|treatment-related adverse event, treatment-related adverse event, 90 days|serious adverse event, serious adverse event, 90 days
A prospective, randomized, open, single-center clinical study evaluating the efficacy (pathological response, survival outcomes) and safety of the combination of Cadonilimab and FOLFOX regimen compared to FOLFOX regimen in the treatment of locally advanced colorectal cancer with proficient mismatch-repair (pMMR) or microsatellite stable (MSS) protein expression.
