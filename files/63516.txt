Ramucirumab + Pembrolizumab in Patients With Recurrent/Metastatic Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
The investigators hypothesize that inhibition of angiogenesis and PD-1 will be more effective than inhibition of PD-1 alone. The first step in pursuing proof of this hypothesis is to establish the safety and feasibility of combining ramucirumab with pembrolizumab, therefore the first part of this protocol is a de-escalation phase I trial of the combination of ramucirumab + pembrolizumab. The key objective of the phase I trial is to establish the safety and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ramucirumab for this novel combination regimen in patients with recurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (RM-HNSCC). The second step in pursuing proof of this hypothesis is to establish the efficacy of ramucirumab (using the RP2D) with pembrolizumab. The second part of this protocol is a single arm phase II trial combining ramucirumab + pembrolizumab. The primary objective of the phase II trial is to determine the tumor response rates (complete response (CR) and partial response (PR)) of the treatment combination given as first line therapy in patients with RM-HNSCC.
Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Ramucirumab|DRUG: Pembrolizumab|OTHER: EORTC QLQ-30|OTHER: FACT H&N|PROCEDURE: Peripheral blood
Recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ramucirumab combined with fixed dose pembrolizumab (Phase I patients only), -The RP2D of ramucirumab is defined as the highest dose level at which fewer than 2 patients of a cohort of three patients experience a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during the first cycle., Completion of first cycle of treatment for all patients enrolled in Phase I portion of study (estimated to be 2.5 months)|Overall tumor response rate of ramucirumab and pembrolizumab (Phase II patients only), * Overall tumor response rate = number of participants with complete response + partial response
* Complete response (CR)=Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm.
* Partial response (PR)=At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., Through 28 days after completion of treatment (estimated to be 6 months)
Adverse event profile of the combination of ramucirumab and pembrolizumab (Phase I and II patients) as measured by the frequency of adverse events, -The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for all toxicity reporting., Through 28 days after completion of treatment (estimated to be 6 months)|Duration of overall response (Phase II patients only), -Duration of overall response: The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).

The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.

-Duration of stable disease: Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements., Through 28 days after completion of treatment (estimated to be 6 months)|Progression-free survival (PFS) (Phase II patients only), * PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first.
* Progressive disease: At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions)., Through 28 days after completion of treatment (estimated to be 6 months)|Overall survival (OS) (Phase II patients only), Through 28 days after completion of treatment (estimated to be 6 months)|Changes in quality of life as measured by FACT H&N (Phase II patients only), * Median scores for each item and domain will be reported at each time point.
* The general questionnaire, FACT-G, consists of 27 questions in four domains - physical (7), social/family (7), emotional (6), and functional (7). FACT-G is supplemented by a head and neck cancer specific subscale consisting of 11 questions to make up the 38 item FACT-H\&N. Scores are calculated separately for each domain, and an unweighted summary score is calculated for the FACT-G and the total FACT H\&N. The maximum score of 144 reflects the best possible quality of life
* Answers to the questions range from 0=not at all to 4=very much, Baseline, start of cycle 2, and start of cycle 5 (estimated to be 12 weeks)|Changes in quality of life as measured by EORTC QLQ-C30 (Phase II patients only), * Median scores for each item and domain will be reported at each time point.
* 30 items questionnaire with answers ranging from 1=not at all to 4=very much
* includes five functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, nausea \& vomiting and pain) and a global health status/QOL scale. Furthermore, it contains six single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea and financial difficulties), Baseline, start of cycle 2, and start of cycle 5 (estimated to be 12 weeks)
