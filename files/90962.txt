Chemotherapy-induced Lipid Profile Changes in Women With Early Breast Cancer
Detection of changes in the lipid profile in early-stage breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel.

Change in fasting lipid profile parameters (TC, TG, LDL-C, HDL-C) during and after chemotherapy, Evaluation of dynamic changes in fasting serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) at predefined timepoints during neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy and at three months after chemotherapy completion., From enrollment (1-3 days prior to chemotherapy initiation) through three months after completion of chemotherapy.
Correlation of lipid profile changes with menopausal status and body mass index (BMI), Assessment of the association between dynamic changes in fasting lipid parameters (TC, TG, LDL-C, HDL-C) and patients' menopausal status and body mass index (BMI) measured at baseline. The analysis aims to explore potential modifiers of chemotherapy-induced lipid alterations., From enrollment (1-3 days prior to chemotherapy initiation) through three months after completion of chemotherapy.
Despite the development of highly effective antitumor therapies over the past two decades (e.g., targeted therapy, immunotherapy), chemotherapy regimens including anthracyclines, taxanes, and cyclophosphamide continue to represent a fundamental component of treatment algorithms for early breast cancer, particularly in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). While the cardiotoxicity of anthracyclines is well established and routinely monitored by echocardiography, changes in lipid profiles induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy have primarily been reported in retrospective studies with heterogeneous patient populations and measurement protocols.

This prospective, single-center study was designed to evaluate changes in lipid parameters in patients with early-stage breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel.
