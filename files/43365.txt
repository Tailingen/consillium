Study of SPI-1620 in Combination With Docetaxel Versus Docetaxel Alone for Patients With Non Small-cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
The purpose of this study is to estimate and compare the objective response rate of SPI-1620 administered in combination with docetaxel in patients with NSCLC and to determine the safety of SPI-1620 when administered in combination with docetaxel.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
DRUG: SPI-1620|DRUG: Docetaxel
Objective Response Rate(ORR) of SPI-1620, To estimate and compare the objective response rate of SPI-1620 administered in combination with docetaxel in patients with NSCLC, Up to 2 years
Duration of Response (DoR), only in Randomized Part., Up to 12 weeks|Progression-free survival(PFS), only in Randomized Part, 2 years from the start of study treatment|Overall survival (OS), 2 years from the start of study treatment|Safety of SPI-1620, Periodic physical examinations with vital sign monitoring, safety laboratories and monitoring of adverse events will be performed., Up to 2 years
This will be a two part study. In Single Arm Part, patients will receive 11 μg/m2 of SPI-1620 IV followed by docetaxel 75 mg/m2 IV. Cycles will continue every 3 weeks until progression or intolerable toxicity. Overall 27 patients will be enrolled in the Single Arm Part. If 6 or more responses (CR/PR) are observed in this group then the Randomized Part will be initiated.

In the Randomized Part approximately 200 patients (100 per arm) will be randomized to receive SPI-1620 plus docetaxel or docetaxel alone.

In the experimental arm, patients will receive 11 μg/m2 of SPI-1620 IV followed by docetaxel 75 mg/m2 IV administered in 3-week cycles until progression or intolerable toxicity. In the control arm, patients will receive 75 mg/m2 docetaxel in 3-week cycles until progression or intolerable toxicity.
