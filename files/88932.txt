Hypofractionated Radiation Fractionation in Breast Cancer Patients with Implant-Based Reconstruction
It is a randomized trial to assess the safety and efficacy between hypofractionation radiation and conventional radiation in women who have undergone mastectomy and immediate breast reconstruction. The investigators will evaluate reconstruction complication, radiotherapy side effects, cosmetic and oncologic outcomes.
Breast Cancer

Major complication, implant related complications requiring reoperation such as severe necrosis，severe infections, severe capsular contracture, implant rupture and implant exposure., From enrollment to the end of treatment at 24 months
Any breast-related complications, Complications included infections, wound dehiscence, skin flap necrosis, implant exposure, capsular contracture, seroma, and hematoma., From enrollment to the end of treatment at 24 months|Absolute reconstruction failure, From enrollment to the end of treatment at 24 months|Oncologic outcomes, local-regional recurrence free survival, From enrollment to the end of treatment at 5 years|Cosmetic outcomes, satisfaction with breast and physical and psychosocial well-bing after radiotherapy will be assessed from baseline to 24 months by trained physicians using Breast-Q Version 2.0© Reconstruction Module Scales Chinese (CN) Version ., From enrollment to the end of treatment at 24 months
Patients with breast cancer frequently have requirement for breast reconstruction after mastectomy. For patients with limited autologous tissue availability, implant-based reconstruction remains an effective alternative. Due to the absence of high-level evidence, collaborative efforts between surgical and radiation oncology teams are advised to determine the optimal sequencing and techniques for integrating reconstruction surgery with radiotherapy. The ongoing Alliance A221505 and FABREC phase III randomized controlled trials are comparing the incidence of reconstructive complications following hypofractionated and conventional fractionation radiotherapy. FABREC trial recently showed the hypofractionated regimen did not significantly improve change in physical well-being（PWB), domain of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B) quality-of-life assessment tool, compared with the conventional fractionation radiotherapy. This trial added to the increasing experience with HF PMRT in patients with implant-based reconstruction.

In 2019, the European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology (ESTRO) provided guidelines for target delineation based on the position of the implant in breast reconstruction to minimize the irradiation of normal tissues. Existing studies on the risk of complications from irradiating expanders and implants have yielded inconsistent conclusions, with each approach having its own advantages and disadvantages.

Our study aims to compare the incidence of reconstructive complications between hypofractionated and conventional fractionation radiotherapy after implant-based reconstruction surgery to provide high-level evidence for medium-dose hypofractionated radiotherapy after immediate implant-based reconstructive surgery.
