Circulating Fibrocytes in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.
The investigators will collect fibrocytes (CD45+Col-1+) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The investigators hypothesize that patients with NSCLC experience expansion of immunosuppressive fibrocytes, which are predicted to augment tumor growth by mediating immune escape in NSCLC patients.
NSCLC
treatment response of participants by RECIST., Correlation of circulating fibrocytes and treatment (chemotherapy, surgery, target treatment) response of patients with NSCLC., 18 months
Survival of participants., Correlation of circulating fibrocytes and survival (progression free survival, disease free survival and overall survival) of patients with NSCLC., 24 months
Staging status of patients with NSCLC., Correlation of circulating fibrocytes and stage of patients with NSCLC., 18 months
Fibrocytes have been described in both mice and humans, where they bear a hematopoietic progenitor phenotype (CD45+Col-1+). Fibrocytes have previously been described in murine cancer, implicated as mediators of tumor immune escape. In this study, the investigators will collect fibrocytes including CD45+Col-1+ expression. The cells express indoleamine oxidase, which is primarily responsible for their immunosuppressive properties. The investigators hypothesize that patients with non-small cell lung cancer experience expansion of immunosuppressive fibrocytes, which are predicted to augment tumor growth by mediating immune escape in non-small cell lung cancer patients.
