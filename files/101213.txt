Neoadjuvant Treatment For Locally Advanced Thymic Cancer
The aims of this study are to verify the feasibility, effectiveness, and safety of the combination of enrolizumab and radiotherapy for neoadjuvant treatment for locally advanced thymic carcinoma, and to provide recommendations for the establishment of unified evaluation criteria for the neoadjuvant therapy of thymic cancer by evaluating the pathological remission status of thymic cancer specimens after neoadjuvant treatment.

objective response rate（ORR）, ORR was defined as the best overall response (BoR), the proportion of participants in complete and partial response among the number of participants in each treatment group who received at least one medication., 24 hour
Disease control rate（DCR）, DCR is defined as the proportion of imaging findings of CR, PR, and stable disease (SD) in all subjects evaluated according to RECIST V1.1 after completing neoadjuvant immunotherapy combined with radiotherapy, 24 hours|Radical resection rate（R0）, Pathological evaluation of the tumor margin, and based on whether the margin is gross or microscopic positive, it is divided into radical resection (R0), microscopic residual lesion (R1), or gross residual lesion (R2), 24 hours|Pathological remission rate, Conduct pathological evaluation based on postoperative specimens to evaluate the percentage of surviving tumor cells, necrosis, and interstitial components in the original tumor bed area., 7 days|disease-free survival（DFS）, The time interval between receiving surgical treatment and tumor recurrence or death due to tumor progression, 5 years|overall survival（OS）, The time interval between receiving surgical treatment and the patient's death due to any reason, and the patient is still alive during the final follow-up, with the survival time ending at the last follow-up., 5 years
For patients with locally advanced thymic carcinoma, it is often difficult to perform radical resection. Numerous studies have reported that neoadjuvant therapy can improve the surgical resection rate of thymic tumors by reducing the extent of tumor invasion and eliminating small metastatic lesions, thereby improving patient survival. However, the efficacy of neoadjuvant immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy is limited. This study intends to conduct a single-arm, phase II clinical trial of neoadjuvant immunotherapy combined with radiotherapy for locally advanced thymic carcinoma to verify the feasibility and safety of neoadjuvant immunotherapy combined with radiotherapy. Meanwhile, the investigators evaluate the pathological remission of postoperative specimens to provide recommendations for establishing pathological evaluation criteria for neoadjuvant therapy for thymic carcinoma.
