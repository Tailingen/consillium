Effects of Chemotherapy on Muscle Mass and Exercise Performance in Patients With Oesophageal Cancer.
Curative treatment for oesophageal cancer involves undertaking chemotherapy followed by an operation to remove the tumour. Chemotherapy has several effects upon the body, including effects upon the systems that control the creation and breakdown of muscle. We aim to review these effects by recording changes in the amount of exercise patients are able to undertake after chemotherapy and reviewing changes in muscle mass.

We aim to review the effects of chemotherapy on skeletal muscle mass and cardio-respiratory performance in patients with oesophageal adenocarcinoma. All patients will be assessed by a Consultant Anaesthetist and a medical member of the Research team before commencing chemotherapy and after finishing their course. These assessments include a nutritional assessment, performance status assessments, blood assays, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans, cardio-pulmonary exercise (CPEX) testing and a muscle biopsy.
