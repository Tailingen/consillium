Pioglitazone Hydrochloride in Preventing Head and Neck Cancer in Patients With Oral Leukoplakia
This phase II trial studies how well pioglitazone hydrochloride works in preventing head and neck cancer in patients who have oral leukoplakia. Chemoprevention therapy is the use of certain drugs to try to prevent the development or recurrence of cancer. The use of pioglitazone hydrochloride may be effective in preventing head and neck cancer.
Head and Neck Cancer|Oral Leukoplakia
DRUG: pioglitazone hydrochloride
Patients' Overall Response, Overall Response= reviewing both the clinical and histological responses and assigning the worst category.

Complete Response (CR) = Clinical CR and Histologic CR, or Histologic CR Partial Response (PR) = Clinical CR or PR and Histologic PR or Stable Disease (SD) Stable Disease (SD) = Clinical SD and Histologic PR or SD Progressive Disease (PD) = Clinical PD and/or Histologic PD, Week 16 (4 weeks post dose)
Patients' Clinical Response, Determined by measurement of lesions- Complete Response (CR)= disappearance of all lesions, Partial Response (PR)= \>or= 50% decrease in sum of lesions, Stable Disease (SD) = does not meet CR,PR or Progressive Disease (PD), and PD= \>or= 25% increase in sum of lesions, Week 16 (4 weeks post dose)|Patients' Histological (Tissue) Response, Determined by biopsy results before and 4 weeks after treatment: Complete Response (CR) =complete reversal of dysplasia or hyperplasia, Partial Response (PR) = \>or=50% decrease in sum of lesions, no increase in 1 or more lesions and no new lesion occurs, Stable Disease (SD0 = not CR, PR or Progressive Disease (PD), PD = \>or= 25% increase in sum of lesions or new lesion or progression to invasive carcinoma., Week 16 (4 weeks post dose)

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Determine whether pioglitazone (pioglitazone hydrochloride) reverses leukoplakia in patients with hyperplastic or dysplastic oral cavity or oropharyngeal leukoplakia.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

Patients receive pioglitazone hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or the development of carcinoma.

Patients are followed up at 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks.
