Percutaneous Image Guided Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgery (VATS) Resection of Lung Lesions
This is a phase II protocol to determine the safety and feasibility of Intraoperative CT fluoroscopy guidance for lung resection for small nodules.
Lung Cancer
PROCEDURE: Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgery (VATS) wedge resection
Number of Participants With Treatment-related Adverse Events as Assessed by CTCAE v4.0, The patient will be monitored while in the hospital by their thoracic surgical team as well as by two research nurses named Lauren Donahue, RN and Karen Magsipoc, NP. The research nurses will document any perioperative complications and mortality that arise during the patient's stay in the hospital., 30 days
Patients Underwent a Successful Resection, Number of patients who underwent a successful resection which is measured by an accurate and appropriate resection in a given timeline, 30 days
This is a phase II protocol to determine the safety and feasibility of image guided CT marking for resection of small lung nodules. This is relevant because many such nodules are hard to localize for minimally invasive lung resection. It is hoped that this technology using fluoro CT capability available now in most operating room will improve safety and reliability of thoracic surgery.
