A Study of KC1036 in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety，tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of KC1036 in participants with advanced recurrent or metastatic solid tumors. The trial will be divided into three parts: dose-escalation phase, dose-expansion phase, RP2D-extension phase.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: KC1036
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), MTD will be defined as the maximum dose level at which no more than 1 of 3 participants experience a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) within the first 4 weeks of multiple dosing., First 4 weeks after initial administration of KC1036|Adverse events (AEs), Incidence of treatment-related AEs, From enrollment up to 30 days after last dose
Pharmacokinetics (PK) profile: Cmax, Peak Plasma Concentration, First 4 weeks after initial administration of KC1036|Pharmacokinetics (PK) profile: Tmax, Time to reach the maximum plasma concentration, First 4 weeks after initial administration of KC1036|Pharmacokinetics (PK) profile: T1/2, Terminal half-life, First 4 weeks after initial administration of KC1036|Pharmacokinetics (PK) profile: AUC0-t and AUC0-∞, Area under the single-dose plasma concentration-time curve from Hour 0 to the last quantifiable measurable plasma concentration, or Area under the single-dose plasma concentration-time curve from Hour 0 to infinity, First 4 weeks after initial administration of KC1036|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Overall response rate (ORR) was defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST 1.1., Every 6 weeks for the duration of study participation; estimated to be 12 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from the start date of study drug to the date of the first radiologically documented progressive disease (PD) per RECIST 1.1 or death due to any cause., Every 6 weeks for the duration of study participation; estimated to be 12 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Disease Control Rate (DCR) was defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) per RECIST 1.1., Every 6 weeks for the duration of study participation; estimated to be 12 months|Duration of Response (DOR), Duration of response (DOR) was defined as the time from first documented response (partial response (PR) or complete response (CR)) to the date of first documented disease progression (PD) or death due to any cause, among patients with a confirmed PR or CR per RECIST 1.1., Every 6 weeks for the duration of study participation; estimated to be 12 months|Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS) was defined as the time from the start date of study drug to the date of death due to any cause., From the first medication to death due to any cause; estimated to be the subject's death, loss to follow-up, or end of the study]
