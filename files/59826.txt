Endoscopy and Radiology-guided Ablation for Inoperable Cholangiocarcinoma
This prospective clinical trial aims to assess the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of a personalized radiofrequency ablation protocol coupled with complete biliary drainage for patients presenting with inoperable perihilar cholangiocarcinoma.
Perihilar Cholangiocarcinoma
PROCEDURE: Endoluminal radiofrequency ablation|PROCEDURE: Endoscopic biliary stenting
Technical success of ERCP procedure, Ability to correctly apply radiofrequency ablation and place stents in all the biliary ducts accessed on ERCP, 2 months|Tumor response, To evaluate the efficacy of radiofrequency ablation in local disease control by assessing tumor response according to RECIST criteria at 6 months follow-up, 6 months
Rate of procedure-related adverse events, To evaluate the safety profile of the procedure by assessing the rate of procedure-related adverse events according to the ASGE lexicon (cholangitis, bleeding, perforation, pancreatitis) after endoscopic treatment, 12 months|Overall survival, To assess patient survival rates at 12 months follow-up, 12 months|Tumor microenvironment alterations, To evaluate the expression of programmed death (PD)-1 / PD- ligand 1 markers on biopsy samples of tumor tissue obtained at the index and follow-up ERCP procedure, 2 months
This clinical trial proposes a personalized treatment approach to inoperable perihilar cholangiocarcinoma consisting of endoluminal ablative therapy via radiofrequency ablation followed by endoscopic biliary drainage.

Patients presenting with jaundice / biliary obstruction caused by inoperable perihilar cholangiocarcinoma as assessed during multidisciplinary case discussion will be invited to enroll in this trial.

Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive biliary plastic stenting (control arm) or biliary plastic stenting + radiofrequency ablation via endoscopic approach. In cases where ERCP fails to achieve adequate biliary drainage, stenting and/or drainage will be attempted via percutaneous approach.

Additional systemic chemotherapy will be offered to all eligible patients according to the local standard of care.

Patients will be followed up with a clinical visit at 2 weeks and stent exchange (+ additional RFA treatment in the control arm) will be offered at 8-12 weeks interval until disease progression, clinical deterioration precluding ERCP or death.

The main study objectives are:

* To assess the technical feasibility of implementing the proposed therapeutic protocol involving a combined endoscopic-radiologic approach to drainage and ablation
* To evaluate the efficacy of radiofrequency ablation in local disease control
* To evaluate whether complete drainage and radiofrequency ablation have a cumulative benefit in patients with inoperable perihilar cholangiocarcinoma
* To evaluate the safety of our proposed therapeutic protocol combining interventional endoscopy with radiology
