A Study of Docetaxel for Injection (Albumin Bound) in Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
This study is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, phase Ⅲ clinical study to compare the clinical efficacy and safety of Docetaxel for Injection (Albumin Bound) in combination with best supportive care versus placebo in combination with best supportive care in participants with pancreatic cancer who have received gemcitabine-containing and fluorouracil-containing regimens.

This study is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, phase Ⅲ clinical study to compare the clinical efficacy and safety of Docetaxel for Injection (Albumin bound) plus best supportive care versus placebo plus best supportive care in participants with pancreatic cancer who have received a previous treatment regimen containing gemcitabine and fluorouracil. It is planned to enroll 142 participants, and participants will be randomized to receive Docetaxel for Injection (albumin bound) in combination with best supportive care or placebo in combination with best supportive care in a 2:1 ratio. Best supportive care includes, but is not limited to, pain control, nutritional support, and psychological care.
