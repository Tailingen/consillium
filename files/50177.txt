Subclinical Hypothyroidism and Chronic Inflammation in PCOS
Chronic inflammation in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) may be the result of dysregulation of cytokine production (due to insulin resistance, excess visceral fat and hyperandrogenemia), i.e., overproduction of pro-inflammatory factors (e.g. TNF, IL-1, IL-6) in relation to anti-inflammatory ones (IL-10). This condition may be an important link between obesity and insulin resistance, which is crucial in the etiopathogenesis of the syndrome. However, it is not known whether it results from the tendency to accumulate adipose tissue or is a feature of the syndrome itself. Concomitant endocrinopathies, i.e. obesity, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, diabetes and thyroid diseases, may additionally influence the activity of chronic inflammation. There is no data indicating the relationship between chronic inflammation and PCOS phenotypes, the severity of metabolic disorders, ovarian reserve and the influence of thyroid function on its activity in PCOS.

The aim of the study is:

i) to assess and compare serum concentrations of selected inflammatory markers (leucocytosis, CRP, procalcitonin, fibrinogen, ferritin, IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha) in women with different phenotypes PCOS and hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis dysfunction (HPOD) (control), ii) to evaluate the impact of subclinical hypothyroidism (defined as TSH\>2.5 uIU/ml, fT3 3,1-6,80 pmol/l, fT4 12,0-22,0 pmol/l), with the presence and absence of circulating antithyroid antibodies (a-TPO and a-TG), on the balance between anti- and pro-inflammatory factors in women with different PCOS and HPOD phenotypes, iii) to assess the impact of imbalance between anti- and pro-inflammatory factors in women with different PCOS and HPOD phenotypes on ovarian reserve indices, expressed as FSH and AMH concentrations.

The study population will be characterized in terms of demographic (age, BMI), gynecological (age of first and last menstrual period, cycle length, history of reproductive organ surgeries, ultrasound measurements of endometrial width, ovarian volume) and obstetrics (pregnancies, childbirth, miscarriages) data. PCOS syndrome (and its phenotypes) will be recognized by the Rotterdam criteria. HPOD will be diagnosed according to WHO criteria. During hospitalization, blood samples will be collected for scheduled analyzes (30 ml of blood in total).
