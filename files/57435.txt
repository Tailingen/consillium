This is a Phase 1/2, open label, multicenter, multidose, first-in-human (FIH) dose escalation and expansion study to determine the safety and tolerability, recommended phase 2 dose and optimal dosing interval, pharmacology, and antitumor activity of RTX-240 in adult patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) or locally advanced solid tumors (Phase 1/2) or R/R acute myeloid leukemia (Phase 1 only), and RTX-240 in combination with pembrolizumab in adult patients with R/R or locally advanced solid tumors (Phase 1 only). RTX-240 is a cellular therapy that co-expresses 4-1BBL and IL-15TP, a fusion of IL-15 and IL-15 receptor alpha, with the goal of stimulating the innate and adaptive immune systems for the treatment of cancer. The study includes a monotherapy dose escalation phase (Phase 1) followed by an expansion phase (Phase 2) in specified tumor types.
