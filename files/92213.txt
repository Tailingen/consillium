Safety and Efficacy of Radiation Plus TACE and Lenvatinib in Advanced HCC With PVTT
This is a multicentri prospective cohort study to investigate the safety and efficacy of external beam radiation (RT) combined with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and lenvatinib vs TACE and lenvatinib in the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT).
