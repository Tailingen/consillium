A Trial of Pamiparib With Tislelizumab in Patients With Advanced Tumours With Homologous Recombination Repair Defects
This study will describe the efficacy of pamiparib in combination with tislelizumab in patients with advanced tumours harbouring molecular profiles consistent with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), agnostic of tumour origin. A tumour-agnostic approach has been adopted in this study due to the broad activity of PARP inhibitors across multiple tumour types. In addition, response to PARP inhibitors has been demonstrated in patients with genomic features associated with HRD, even in the absence of germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. These results suggest that the presence of HRD itself is the key predictive biomarker for PARP inhibitor efficacy. This paves the way for a precision-oncology, tumour-agnostic approach to patient selection for treatment, rather than the traditional tumour site-of-origin basis for which the current PARP inhibitor approvals exist. To investigate this, cohort A of this study includes patients with genomic features of HRD, but without a germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. Demonstration of clinical efficacy in this cohort will provide strong support to the tumour-agnostic, precision-oncology approach for patient selection for PARP inhibitor or PARP inhibitor combination treatment. This forms the primary objective of the study. The study will consist of two cohorts, broadly, cohort A - patients without a pathogenic BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation but with other germline or somatic mutations in other HRD genes; cohort B- patients with a pathogenic BRCA1 or BRCA2

DRUG: Pamiparib|DRUG: Tislelizumab
Evaluation of clinical benefit rate (CBR) in patients with advanced tumours harbouring molecular profiles consistent with homologous recombination defeciency (HRD), without a known pathogenic germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation., CBR, defined as the proportion of patients with either objective response (partial response (PR) + complete response (CR)) as best response, or stable disease (SD) at 12 weeks post registration, as determined by the Investigator by RECIST 1.1 in cohort A, 12 weeks after commencement of treatment
Efficacy of pamiparib in combination with tislelizumab in patients with advanced tumours harbouring molecular profiles consistent with HRD, and without a known pathogenic germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, Efficacy will be measured by:

* overall response rate (ORR) - defined as the proportion of patients with an objective response (partial response + complete response) as best response (as determined by the Investigator by RECIST 1.1), At the end of the study, approximately 4 years after the first participant commences treatment|Efficacy of pamiparib in combination with tislelizumab in patients with advanced tumours harbouring molecular profiles consistent with HRD, and without a known pathogenic germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, Efficacy will be measured by:

-progression free survival (PFS) - defined as the time from first dose of study medication to the first occurrence of disease progression, as determined by the Investigator according to RECIST 1.1, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, At the end of the study, approximately 4 years after the first participant commences treatment|Efficacy of pamiparib in combination with tislelizumab in patients with advanced tumours harbouring molecular profiles consistent with HRD, and without a known pathogenic germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, Efficacy will be measured by:

-overall survival (OS) - defined as the time from first dose of study medication to death from any cause, At the end of the study, approximately 4 years after the first participant commences treatment|Evaluation of CBR of pamiparib in combination with tislelizumab in patients with advanced tumours harbouring molecular profiles consistent with HRD (independent of germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation status), CBR, defined as the proportion of patients with either objective response (partial response (PR) + complete response (CR)) as best response, or stable disease (SD) at 12 weeks post registration, as determined by the Investigator by RECIST 1.1 in cohort A and B, 12 weeks post commencement of treatment|Severity of Treatment -Emergent Events (Safety of pamiparib in combination with tiselizumab), Severity of adverse events as determined by NCI CTCAE 5.0, At the end of the study, approximately 4 years after the first participant commences treatment|Determination of HRD phenotype as a predictor of response, A tumour based whole genome HRD assay will provide a binary outcome as to whether HRD is "present" or "absent". Logistic regression models will be used to compare CBR between patients with tumours that have HRD "present" vs "absent"., At the end of the study, approximately 4 years after the first participant commences treatment
