Pembrolizumab (MK3475), Gemcitabine, and Concurrent Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy for Muscle-Invasive Urothelial Cancer of the Bladder
This trial is to assess the efficacy of pembrolizumab (MK3475) added to concurrent radiation and gemcitabine in the management of patients with muscle-invasive urothelial cancer who are not candidates for or decline radical cystectomy.
Muscle-invasive Urothelial Cancer of the Bladder
BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab|PROCEDURE: Transurethral Resection of Bladder Tumor|DRUG: Gemcitabine|RADIATION: External Beam Radiation Therapy
Two-year bladder-intact disease-free survival rate, Bladder-intact disease-free survival is defined as time from initiation of protocol therapy until the development of muscle-invasive bladder cancer recurrence, regional pelvic recurrence, distant metastases, bladder cancer-related death, or cystectomy., 2 years
Safety (adverse events) of the protocol therapy, The adverse events are evaluated per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 4., From beginning of protocol therapy to 90 days after the end of radiation therapy|Complete response (CR) rate, The CR rate is the percentage of patients who have achieved CR. At the completion of protocol therapy, patients undergo standard cystoscopy, exam under anesthesia and transurethral resection of bladder tumor to document pathologic response. CR requires no tumor palpable on bimanual examination under anesthesia, no tumor visible on cystoscopy, negative tumor site biopsy, and negative urine cytology., up to 21 weeks|Overall survival, Defined as time to death from beginning of protocol therapy., up to 5 years|Metastasis-free survival, Defined as time to the development of radiographic distant metastases from beginning of protocol therapy., up to 5 years
The investigators hypothesize that the addition of immune checkpoint inhibition with pembrolizumab, an anti-PD-1 inhibitor, to chemo-radiation therapy to the bladder may work to both increase eradication of local tumor as well as distant micrometastases through heightened immune surveillance.

Due to the lack of a previous phase I trial establishing the safety of this combination (pembrolizumab, gemcitabine, and radiation therapy (RT)), an initial safety lead-in cohort of 3 to 6 patients is enrolled for assessing dose-limiting toxicities. Similar to the Phase I 3+3 design, if there is no or only one patient in that cohort experiencing a dose-limiting toxicity, the trial continues to the Phase II part to enroll additional 48 patients for efficacy evaluation.
