A Study of HDM2005 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumor
This is a study evaluating the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics ofHDM2005 in participants with metastatic solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: HDM2005
Incidence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) events (for dose escalation phase), DLT will be determined by definition during the DLT observation period., up to 21 days or 28 days following first dose|Incident and severity of adverse events(for dose escalation phase), The safety profile of HDM2005 will be assessed by monitoring the adverse events (AE) per the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v5.0., Until 28 days after the last dose or initiation of a new antineoplastic therapy, whichever occurs first.|Progression-free survival(PFS)(for dose expansion phase), PFS, defined as the interval from the start of study treatment to the earlier of the first documentation of disease progression or death from any cause per RECIST, Version 1.1., Approximately 30 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR)(for dose expansion phase), Objective response rate (ORR), which includes best response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as assessed by the investigator., Approximately 18 months|Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) (for dose expansion phase) Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) (for dose expansion phase) Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) (for dose expansion phase), The selection of RP2D will be based on consideration of overall safety information together with available pharmacokinetic,E-R relationships, and efficacy data. The selection of RP2D will be based on consideration of overall safety information together with available pharmacokinetic and efficacy data., Approximately 30 months
Plasma concentration of HDM2005, total antibody and the free MMAE, Plasma concentration of HDM2005, total antibody and the free MMAE will be reported for each arm., up to 28 days following last dose|Immunogenicity, Number and percentage of anti-drug antibody (ADA)-positive patients will be assessed., up to 28 days following last dose|Objective Response Rate (ORR)(for dose escalation phase), Objective response rate (ORR), which includes best response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as assessed by the investigator., Approximately 18 months|Time to Response (TTR), TTR is defined as the interval from the start of study therapy to the first documentation of an objective response., Approximately 30 months|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the interval from the first documentation of objective response to the earlier of the first documentation of disease progression/relapse or death from any cause., Approximately 30 months|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the interval from the start of study therapy to death from any cause., Approximately 30 months
