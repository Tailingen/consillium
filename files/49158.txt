VX15/2503 With or Without Ipilimumab and/or Nivolumab in Patients With Resectable Stage IIIB-D Melanoma
This pilot phase I trial studies how well VX15/2503 (pepinemab) with or without ipilimumab and/or nivolumab work in treating participants with stage IIIB-D melanoma that can be removed by surgery. Monoclonal antibodies, such as VX15/2503, ipilimumab, and nivolumab may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

Biomarker parameter analysis: extent of cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8)+ T cell infiltration between experimental groups following treatment, The two-sample t-test will be used to compare the change in CD8+ T cell infiltration after treatment between each experimental group (Cohort A, B, C, and D) and the control group (cohort E), respectively., Up to 10 years after study start
Incidence of adverse events assessed by National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0, Descriptive statistics for worst grade of each laboratory parameter by the NCI CTCAE scale version 4.0 at baseline and follow-up will be presented., Up to 8 weeks after surgery|Response rate, For participants to be considered evaluable for efficacy, they must have completed the treatment and have a baseline tumor assessment. Response rate will be calculated as proportion (responders/total participants)., Up to 10 years after study start|Overall survival (OS), For overall survival, death from any cause will be defined as the event., Assessed up to 10 years after study start|Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression or death from any cause will be defined as the event., Assessed up to 10 years after study start
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. Evaluate the effect of VX15/2503 (pepinemab) in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors on T cell infiltrate into the tumor microenvironment in involved and uninvolved lymph nodes and peripheral blood.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Evaluate the effect of VX15/2503 in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors on the immune profile of involved and uninvolved lymph nodes and peripheral blood.

II. Assess safety and tolerability of profile and tolerability of single agent VX15/2503 to the combination of VX15/2503 and immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with resectable metastatic melanoma.

III. Document pathologic response rates of single agent VX15/2503 and combination VX15/2503 and immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with resectable melanoma.

IV. Compare pathologic response to radiographic response using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria in patients receiving single agent VX15/2503 and combination VX15/2503 and immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with resectable melanoma.

OUTLINE: Participants are assigned to 1 of 5 arms.

ARM I: Participants receive VX15/2503 intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes and nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 21 and undergo surgery between days 35-49.

ARM II: Participants receive VX15/2503 IV over 60 minutes and ipilimumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 21 and undergo surgery between days 35-49.

ARM III: Participants receive VX15/2503 IV over 60 minutes, nivolumab IV over 30 minutes, and ipilimumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 21 and undergo between days 35-49.

ARM IV: Participants nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 21 and undergo between days 35-49.

ARM V: Participants undergo surgery.

After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 90 days, every 12 weeks for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, then annually up to 10 years.
