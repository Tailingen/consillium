A Study of PEP503(Radio-enhancer) With Radiotherapy and Chemotherapy for Patients With Rectal Cancer
This phase Ib/II study is a prospective, open-label, single arm, nonrandomized study of PEP503(radio-enhancer).

There are 2 portions in this study.

* Escalation phase (Part Ib): A 3 + 3 dose escalation study design will be adopted in this phase to identify the recommended injection volume of PEP503 for intratumor injection.
* Expansion phase (Part II): Following the confirmation of the recommended volume of intratumor injection, 18 additional patients will be enrolled at the recommended volume level to evaluate for efficacy.

safety profile /the Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), Safety as assess the safety profile and determine the Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) of PEP503 given as intratumor injection and activated by external beam radiation, with concurrent chemotherapy in patients with unresectable rectal cancer, up to 36 months|the recommended volume (dose), recommended volume (dose) of PEP503 examined by given as intratumor injection and activated by external beam radiation. with concurrent chemotherapy in patients with unresectable rectal cancer, up to 36 months|anti-tumor activity, Anti-tumor activity as assessed by response rate (RR, as per RECIST 1.1) of PEP503 at the recommended volume given as intratumor injection and activated by external beam radiation, with concurrent chemotherapy in patients with unresectable rectal cancer, up to 36 months
The target population is composed by patients who have confirmed adenocarcinoma of the rectum which is T3-4, N any, or locally unresectable, with tumor distal margin within 10 cm of the anal verge, with no evidence of distant metastatic disease, ECOG performance 0-1, and adequate bone marrow, renal and hepatic function.
