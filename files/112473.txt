Lung Cancer Screening Protocol
The successful implementation of lung cancer screening across diverse setting requires working with the community and primary care practices. Collaborating across diverse community-based sites will employ local knowledge and culture in the understanding of the health problem and identifying and implementing solutions that are appropriate for all partners (patients, primary care, referral centers). Enhanced, culturally-competent communication with patients at high risk for lung cancer can narrow inequities in screening awareness, referral, and utilization, as well as improve lung cancer outcomes across diverse patients and communities. Promoting partnerships among physicians, staff, and patients; creating routines; and tailoring materials to each clinician's situation have been show to increase the proportion of patients receiving screening.
