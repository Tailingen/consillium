Timing of Post-prostatectomy PSMA Imaging
The investigators will randomize patients presenting with early BCR with a negative baseline PSMA PET/CT, to upfront SRT or surveillance. Early BCR is defined as a PSA relapse of \>0.1 to \<0.3 ng/mL. Patients in the surveillance arm will be monitored with PSA every 3 months. A repeat PSMA PET/CT will be undertaken when the PSA reaches a target level of \>0.5 to \<1.0 ng/mL. Both early radiation treatment and surveillance with repeat PSMA PET/CT imaging are within patterns of practice locally; therefore, the investigators believe that there is clinical equipoise on this subject.

Surveillance with delayed PSMA PET scan, This study will assess the feasibility of surveillance with delayed repeat PSMA PET/CT in patients with BCR of prostate cancer following radical prostatectomy with negative baseline PSMA PET/CT. A treating physician questionnaire will be completed prior to screening and enrollment, as well as PSA results every three months for surveillance patients., 7 years
