Panobinostat or Placebo With Bortezomib and Dexamethasone in Patients With Relapsed Multiple Myeloma
Panobinostat (LBH589) is a highly potent pan-deacetylase inhibitor (pan-DACi), inclusive of HDAC6, which disrupts aggresome function, promotes accumulation of cytotoxic misfolded protein aggregates and triggers myeloma cell death. Combination of pan-DAC and protease inhibition by co-treatment with panobinostat (PAN) and bortezomib (BTZ) has demonstrated synergistic cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo in pre-clinical experiments. Furthermore, clinical experience in advanced multiple myeloma (MM) patients treated by oral panobinostat and i.v bortezomib ± dexamethasone showed very encouraging results for efficacy and manageable toxicity profile.

Given the medical need for improved treatment strategies for patients with previously treated and relapsed MM, the purpose of this prospective, multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group Phase III study is to compare the results in progression-free survival of 2 combination therapies, panobinostat with bortezomib and dexamethasone or placebo with bortezomib and dexamethasone, in patients with previously treated MM whose disease has recurred or progressed.

Higher scores in the future perspective and body image scores indicate improvement. LS Means and SEM are estimated from the repeated measures model. Following factors and covariates are included in the repeated measurement model: time, treatment, treatment by time interaction, number of prior lines of anti-MM therapy (1/ 2 and 3), prior use of BTZ (Yes/ No), baseline score.Disease Symptom is the sum of 20 questions, total score ranges from 0 (best possible outcome) to 100 (worst possible outcome)", All subscales of EORTC QLQ-MY20 have the same score range of 0 -100. Decrease in symptom scores from baseline indicate improvement in symptoms., 12, 24 and 48 weeks|European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Multiple Myeloma Module (EORTC ) QLQ-C30 - Summary Statistics by Treatment Group, The EORTC QLQ-C30 measures functional dimensions (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social), three multi-item symptom scales (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and pain), six single-item symptom scales (dyspnea, sleep disturbance, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea and financial impact) and a global health status/QoL scale. Disease Symptom is the sum of 30 questions, total score ranges from 0 (best possible outcome) to 100 (worst possible outcome)", All subscales of EORTC QLQ-C30 have the same score range of 0 -100. For global health status and other functional scales,an increase from baseline indicates improvement of QoL. Whereas for symptoms scales, fatigue, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation and diarrhea, decrease in scores from baseline indicate improvement in symptoms., 12, 24 and 48 weeks|Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) Measurement System : FACT/GOG-NTX-Change From Baseline by Treatment Group, Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) Measurement System and focuses on four general quality of life domains for physical well being, functional well-being, social/family well-being, and emotional well-being, and includes additional items to characterize treatment-related neurotoxicity. Higher subscales/total scores represent higher QOL. In the case of the neurotoxicity subscale, lower scores correspond to higher neurotoxicity. The recall period referenced in the questionnaire is the past 7 days.Ranges for FACT-G subscales are as follows:.PWB, scale 0 -28, , NtxS scale 0-44, FACT/GOG-Ntx trial outcome index scale is 0-100 and FACT-G scale is also scaled 0-100. An increase from baseline in these scores indicate improvement., 12, 24 and 48 weeks
