Can a Pulmonologist Reliably Assess the Tumor Burden on ROSE Slides Obtained From Pulmonary Nodules and Lymphadenopathy
The study is aimed at verifying if a pulmonologist can reliably assess the tumor burden for the extractive molecular analysis in ROSE samples obtained with endoscopic sampling procedures from intrathoracic lymphadenopathy and pulmonary nodules.
Lung Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Rapid on-site evaluation
Accuracy with which a pulmonologist can assess the tumor burden on ROSE slides, The outcome 1 will be measured by verifying the agreement between the pulmonologist judgment and the molecular pathologist judgment, the latter being the gold standard, The time frame is the duration of each bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) for each patient enrolled
Interobserver agreement between pulmonologist, pathologist and molecular pathologist in then assessment of the tumor burden on ROSE slides, The outcome 2 will be measured by verifying the agreement between the 3 professionals, using the judgment of the molecular pathologist as gold standard, The time frame is the duration of each bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) for each patient enrolled|Accuracy with which a pulmonologist can identify malignancy on ROSE samples, The outcome 3 will be measured by verifying the agreement between pulmonologist and pathologist, the latter being the gold standard, The time frame is the duration of each bronchoscopy endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) for each patient enrolled
