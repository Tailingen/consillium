A Study to Investigate Fadraciclib (CYC065), in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors and Lymphoma
This is a 2-part, phase 1/2, open-label, multicenter study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, pharmacodynamics, PGx, and efficacy of fadraciclib administered orally BID. This study consists of Phase 1 and Phase 2 components in subjects with advanced solid tumors and lymphoma who have progressed despite having standard therapy or for which no standard therapy exists.
Solid Tumor, Adult|Lymphoma
DRUG: Fadraciclib
Maximum tolerated dose, The incidence rate of dose-limiting toxicities (first cycle only) at each dose level, 6 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR), Assessment of response criteria according to RESIST, Lugano or mSWAT, 18 months
Adverse events, Type, frequency, and severity of adverse drug reactions, 24 months|AUC, Fadraciclib plasma concentrations, 6 months|Cmax, Fadraciclib plasma concentrations, 6 months|Tmax, Fadraciclib plasma concentrations, 6 months|T1/2, Fadraciclib plasma concentrations, 6 months
Pharmacodynamics, To investigate CDK9-dependent transcription inhibition as assessed by differential target gene expression relative to baseline., 6 months|Pharmacogenomics, To investigate plasma cell-free DNA mutation and copy number variation profile of fadraciclib as determined by NGS., 24 months
Phase 1 part of the study will consist of a dose-escalation and a dose-finding component .

Phase 2 will enroll subjects with locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic, histologically confirmed advanced solid tumors or lymphoma, who have failed all standard therapies or for whom standard therapy does not exist, into 8 groups:

Group 1: Endometrial or Ovarian cancer

Group 2: Biliary tract cancer

Group 3: HCC

Group 4: Breast cancer, meeting any of the following criteria:

* HER-2 refractory MBC
* HR positive, HER-2 negative, MBC post-CDK4/6 inhibitor
* Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)

Group 5: B-cell lymphoma

Group 6: T-cell lymphoma (CTCL and PTCL)

Group 7: mCRC, including KRAS mutated mCRC

Group 8: Basket cohort: Tumor types suspected to have a related mechanism of action such as MCL1, MYC or CCNE amplification/overexpression not included in previous groups.
