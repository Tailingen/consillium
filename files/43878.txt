A Study Investigating the Efficacy and Safety of ABT-494 Given With Methotrexate in Subjects With Rheumatoid Arthritis Who Failed Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) Biologic Therapy
The primary objective is to compare the safety and efficacy of multiple doses of ABT-494 versus placebo in moderately to severely active RA subjects on stable background MTX therapy with inadequate response or intolerance to anti-TNF biologic therapy.
Rheumatoid Arthritis
DRUG: ABT-494|DRUG: Placebo
Number of Subjects Achieving American College of Rheumatology 20% (ACR20) Response at Week 12, Response defined as at least 20% reduction (improvement) compared with baseline in tender joint count (TJC68), swollen joint count (SJC66), and at least 3 of the 5 remaining ACR core set measures: patient's assessment of pain, patient's global assessment of disease activity (PtGA); physician's global assessment of disease activity (PGA), Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs CRP). Last observation carried forward (LOCF) was used for missing data., Baseline (Week 0) and Week 12
Number of Subjects Achieving American College of Rheumatology 50% (ACR50) Response at Week 12, Response defined as at least 50% reduction (improvement) compared with baseline in tender joint count (TJC68), swollen joint count (SJC66), and at least 3 of the 5 remaining ACR core set measures: patient's assessment of pain, PtGA; PGA, HAQ-DI, and hs CRP. LOCF was used., Baseline (Week 0) and Week 12|Number of Subjects Achieving American College of Rheumatology 70% (ACR70) Response at Week 12, Response defined as at least 70% reduction (improvement) compared with baseline in tender joint count (TJC68), swollen joint count (SJC66), and at least 3 of the 5 remaining ACR core set measures: patient's assessment of pain, PtGA; PGA, HAQ-DI, and hs CRP. LOCF was used., Baseline (Week 0) and Week 12|Number of Subjects Achieving Low Disease Activity (LDA) Based on Disease Activity Score (DAS28) or Clinical Remission (CR) Based on (DAS28) at Week 12, LDA is defined as DAS28 from 2.6 to \< 3.2 at Week 12. CR is defined as DAS28 (CRP) \< 2.6 at Week 12. The DAS28 is a validated index of rheumatoid arthritis disease activity. Twenty-eight tender joint counts, 28 swollen joint counts, hs CRP, and general health are included in the DAS28 score. Scores on the DAS28 range from 0 to 10. A DAS28 score \>5.1 indicates high disease activity, a DAS28 score \<3.2 indicates low disease activity, and a DAS28 score \<2.6 indicates clinical remission.
