Study of WNT974 in Combination With LGX818 and Cetuximab in Patients With BRAF-mutant Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (mCRC) and Wnt Pathway Mutations
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and anti-tumor activity of the triple combination of WNT974, LGX818 and cetuximab in BRAFV600-mutant mCRC with RNF43 mutations or RSPO fusions.

The design of this study is based upon the translational and pre-clinical data that suggest that Wnt pathway signals, increased due to RNF43 mutations or RSPO fusions, cooperate with the EGFR and BRAF signals to maintain the growth of BRAFV600 CRCs. Inhibition of these signals with the triple combination of WNT974, LGX818 and cetuximab may result in anti-tumor activity.
