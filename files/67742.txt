Intra-op vs Pre-op Transbronchial Localization for Small Lung Nodule
Comparing pre-operative transbronchial localization under augmented fluoroscopy and intra-operative transbronchial localization using electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy system for small lung nodules.
Lung Cancer
PROCEDURE: AF-guided endobronchial marking|DEVICE: ENB-guided endobronchial marking
Successful localization, Discrepancy from lesion to marking: less than 1 cm, 2 days|Successful resection, Lesion contained in first resected specimen, 2 days
Localization duration, Total time span of localization procedure, 1 day|Total radiation exposure, Radiation during entire localization procedure, 2 days|Complication, Procedure related complication, 14 days
Using electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB), transbronchial localization can be performed in the operating room (OR) under general anesthesia without extra radiation exposure, which is expected to reduce the discomfort for the patient during localization. This study will be carried out at the Hsinchu Branch of National Taiwan University Hospital. It is expected that 40 patients with pulmonary nodules will be randomly assigned into two groups. One group will receive bronchoscopic dye localization in the hybrid examination room equipped with cone-beam computed tomography, and the other group will receive ENB-guided dye localization in OR. The primary goal of the study was to compare the localization duration of the two groups of patients, the total dose of radiation exposure during localization and the incidence of location-related complications, and the secondary goals were the results of the surgical procedure, including the surgical duration.
