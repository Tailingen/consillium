Shortened High-dose Palliative Radiotherapy for Lung Cancer
The SHiP-Rt Study aims to investigate the safety and efficacy of reducing the number of RT fractions and RT duration, compared to the current standard of care (36Gy in 12 fractions over 16 days), by using shortened hypofractionated accelerated palliative radiotherapy (30Gy in 6 alternate-day fractions), aided by contemporary RT planning, verification, and delivery techniques.
