Safety and Tolerability Based on the Number of Participants With Adverse Events and Comparison of Baseline and Post Dose Parameters, Safety and tolerability based on the number of participants with adverse events. Assessment and comparison to baseline of the following:

* Physical exam
* Safety bloods and urinalysis
* 12-lead ECG
* Vital signs, Participants will be followed until follow up visit, 6-11 days after dosing
Area Under the Curve of the Compound Dexanabinol (ETS2101) From Pre-dose up to 48 Hours Post Dose, Pharmacokinetic parameters will be assessed in a blinded fashion at the end of each cohort, prior to dose escalation., Pre-dose, 0.5,1,1.5,2,3,4,5,6,8,10,12,16,24,36,48 hours post dose
Pharmacodynamic Biomarker Assessment, Blood samples taken and analysed for the purposes of the identification and quantification of pharmacodynamic biomarkers pre-dose and at several points after dosing., Pre-dose, 1, 6 and 24 hours post dose
The purpose of this study is to test the safety and observe the pharmacokinetics (distribution and elimination of the drug) of the compound dexanabinol (ETS2101) in healthy male subjects following a single oral dose.
