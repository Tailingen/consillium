Tumor Perfusion and Hypoxia Assessed by DCE-MRI and 18F-FMISO PET as Biomarkers of Treatment Response in Cervical Cancer
This study is to assess how patients respond to their treatment for cervical cancer. This research does not involve a specific treatment for the cancer that will be recommended by the doctor and may include radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy. This is a separate research imaging study designed to assess how patients respond to their treatment for cervical cancer.

OTHER: DCE-MRI and 18F-FMISO PET
predict tumor response, For each DCE-MRI parameter, the relative percent change from baseline to the two-week measurement will be calculated. These values will be assessed using ROC curves to evaluate whether they are predictive of tumor response., 2 years
predict disease-free survival, baseline tumor perfusion parameters are predictive of disease-free survival at 2 years and 5 years, the primary analysis will again be an ROC analysis, but with the ROC curves modified to take into account the censored failure-outcome. We will create time-dependent ROC curves using methods described by Heagerty et al., 2 years
