Effect of Sarilumab on Patient-reported Outcomes in Patients With Active Rheumatoid Arthritis
Primary Objective:

To assess the effect of sarilumab in combination with conventional synthetic Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drug (csDMARD) and/or monotherapy on participant-reported impact of disease, using the rheumatoid arthritis impact of disease (RAID) questionnaire, in participants with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and inadequate response or intolerance to current csDMARD or tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors.

Secondary Objectives:

* To assess the change of the RAID score from baseline (to Week 4, Week 12, and Week 24) in participants with moderately to severely active RA and inadequate response or intolerance to current csDMARD or TNF inhibitors, treated with sarilumab in combination with csDMARD and/or monotherapy.
* To assess the effect of sarilumab in combination with csDMARD and/or monotherapy on other participant-reported outcomes (global assessment of disease activity, disability, morning stiffness, fatigue, anxiety/depression, mood disorders, and physical activities) in participants with moderately to severely active RA and inadequate response or intolerance to current csDMARD or TNF inhibitors.
* To assess the efficacy of sarilumab in combination with csDMARD and/or monotherapy using disease activity score-28 for RA with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR) and clinical disease activity index in participants with moderately to severely active RA and inadequate response or intolerance to current csDMARD or TNF inhibitors.
* To assess the safety of sarilumab in combination with csDMARD and/or monotherapy in participants with moderately to severely active RA and inadequate response or intolerance to current csDMARD or TNF inhibitors.

Change From Baseline in Rheumatoid Arthritis Impact of Disease Total Score at Week 24, RAID was a participant reported outcome measure used to evaluate the impact of RA on participant's quality of life which comprised 7 domains: • pain, • function, • fatigue, • physical and psychological well-being, • sleep disturbance, and • coping. Each domain was a single question scored on a 0 to 10 continuous NRS. The values for each of these domains were weighed by participant assessment of relative importance and combined in a single value. Total RAID score range was 0 (not affected, very good) to 10 (most affected), where higher value indicated worse status., Baseline, Week 24
