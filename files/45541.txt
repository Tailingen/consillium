Low-dose Computed Tomography-guided Core Needle Biopsy for Lung Nodules
Investigators aim to compare the diagnostic accuracy and radiation exposure between low-dose and standard-dose computed tomography-guided core needle biopsy for lung nodules.

Diagnostic accuracy, Diagnostic accuracy is defined as the biopsy diagnosis matches with the final diagnosis. The final diagnosis is made according to the surgical or follow-up findings., From the date of randomization until the date of first documented final diagnosis, assessed up to 12 months
Radiation dose, Radiation dose is the radiation exposure from the computed tomography device to patients., From the date of randomization until the date of first documented biopsy procedures, assessed up to 1 day.
At present, low-dose scanning protocol is widely used in computed tomography-guided interventions because these procedures usually require repeat scans, which causes more radiation exposure to the patients. Computed tomography-guided core needle biopsy is widely used in diagnosis of lung nodules with an overall diagnostic accuracy of 93%-97%. Compared with the large lung lesions, computed tomography-guided core needle biopsy for lung nodules might require more scanning to adjust the position of needle tip. Therefore, it might expose the patients to more radiation. However, studies regarding computed tomography-guided core needle biopsy for lung nodules are still lacking.

In this study, investigators aim to compare the diagnostic accuracy and radiation exposure between low-dose and standard-dose computed tomography-guided core needle biopsy for lung nodules.
