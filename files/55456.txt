PD 0332991 and Cetuximab in Patients With Incurable SCCHN
The purpose of this Phase I/II study is to define the maximum tolerated dose of PD 0332991 given with cetuximab and evaluated the side effects of the combination.
Carcinoma, Squamous Cell of Head and Neck
BIOLOGICAL: Cetuximab|DRUG: PD 0332991
Phase I - Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), MTD is the dose level (DL) immediately below the DL at which 2 patients of a cohort experience dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in the 1st cycle (DLTs) Hematologic DLT is any of the below that occur during the 1st cycle that are possibly, probably, or definitely related to the treatment grade 4 neutropenia ≥7 days grade 4 infection with grade 3/4 neutropenia grade 4 thrombocytopenia with life-threatening bleeding treatment held for \>14 days due to hematologic toxicity febrile neutropenia with temperature \>=38.5°C

Non-hematologic DLT is any possibly, probably, or definitely related grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity that occurs during the 1st except for suboptimally treated grade 3 or 4 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, or lymphopenia grade 3 metabolic abnormalities (limited to potassium, magnesium, and calcium) any hypersensitivity/infusion reaction or acneiform rash due to cetuximab treatment held for \>14 days due to non-hematologic toxicity, 6 months (estimated completion of Phase I)|Phase II: Efficacy as Measured by Overall Response Rate, Tumor measurements will be collected at baseline, end of every even numbered cycles, and end of treatment.

Measured by overall response rate (ORR=CR+PR) defined by RECIST criteria

Best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of treatment until disease progression/recurrence

Complete Response (CR) is defined as disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (\<10 mm short axis).

Partial Response (PR) is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters, End of treatment (estimated to be 12 months)
Phase I: Most Frequent Adverse Events, Assessed by NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0, Up to 30 days following completion of treatment (estimated to be 13 months)|Phase II: PD 0332991 Related Adverse Events Occurring in 10% or More of Participants and All Grade 3-5 Adverse Events, Assessed by NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0, Up to 30 days following completion of treatment (estimated to be 13 months)|Phase II: Cetuximab Related Adverse Events Occurring in 10% or More of Participants and All Grade 3-5 Adverse Events, Assessed by NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0, Up to 30 days following completion of treatment (estimated to be 13 months)|Phase II: Adverse Events Occurring in 10% or More of Participants and All Grade 3-5 Adverse Events, Assessed by NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0, Up to 30 days following completion of treatment (estimated to be 13 months)|Phase II: Progression Free Survival (PFS), Participants were followed every 2 months for up to 5 years or until death, whichever occurs first.

PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first., Up to 5 years|Phase II: Overall Survival (OS), Participants were followed every 2 months for up to 5 years or until death, whichever occurs first.

Overall survival is measured from time of diagnosis to time of death., Up to 5 years|Phase II: Duration of Response, Duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented., Completion of treatment (estimated to be 12 months)
The purpose of this Phase I/II study is to define the maximum tolerated dose of PD 0332991 given with cetuximab and evaluated the side effects of the combination.
