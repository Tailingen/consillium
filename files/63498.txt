Safety of TACE With Oxaliplatin, Irinotecan and Raltitrexed for Refractory Colorectal Cancer Liver Metastasis
The purpose of this study is to observe whether hepatic infusion by oxaliplatin, irinotecan and raltitrexed with or without embolization by lipiodol or microspheres are effective in the treatment of refratory liver metastasis from colorectal cancer.
Colon Cancer Liver Metastasis
number of adverse events, 6 months
Overall survival, 2 years|Time to progression, one year
Colorectal cancer is one of most popular cancer worldwide. Patients with liver metastasis have poor prognosis except for curative resection. Chemotherapy combined biologic agents have improved mCRC median progress free survival and median overall surivival, but it is difficult to deal with liver lesions after FOLFOX and FOLFIRI treatments failed. We aim to observe the safety and efficacy of hepatic infusion and embolization of oxaliplatin, irinotecan and raltitrexed treatment for refratory liver metastasis from colorectal cancer.
