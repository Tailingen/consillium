This is a Phase 1b/2, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation, and dose-expansion study to assess the safety, preliminary antitumor activity, immunogenicity, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of oleclumab with or without durvalumab in combination with chemotherapy administered in participants with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Participants with previously untreated metastatic PDAC (first-line \[1L\] metastatic PDAC) will be enrolled in Cohort A. Participants with metastatic PDAC previously treated with gemcitabine-based chemotherapy (without exposure to 5-fluorouracil \[5-FU\], capecitabine, or oxaliplatin; second-line \[2L\] metastatic PDAC) will be enrolled in Cohort B. The study consists of 2 parts, dose escalation (Part 1) and dose expansion (Part 2).
