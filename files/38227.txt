A Two-Stage Phase 2 Study Of A-007 Topical Gel in High-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions (HSIL)
A-007 is an investigational therapy which may be effective in the treatment of pre-cancerous cervical dysplasia (abnormal cell growth). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of A-007, when used to treat high-grade cervical dysplasia.
Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia|Uterine Cervical Dysplasia
DRUG: A-007
Determine overall pathological response (complete and partial, based on independent review at month 4) of A-007 when applied topically for two 28-day cycles of 14 consec. days of treatment each to the uterine cervix of women with HSIL [CIN 2/3]., Over the course of the trial
Determine the local tolerability and systemic safety of A-007., over the course of the trial|Evaluate the effects of A-007 gel treatment on human papillomavirus (HPV) eradication., over the course of the trial
This is a non-randomized, two-stage phase II study with pathological response rate as the primary objective. Following biopsy confirmation of CIN 2/3 within the last 12 weeks, women will treat themselves with gel applied to the cervix via an intravaginal applicator. Patients will apply gel once daily for 14 consecutive days of a 28-day cycle for 2 cycles.

Women will return to clinic for safety assessments, colposcopy, cytology, and virologic and immunologic testing (see schedule of events in attachment TG-003.01 for visit intervals).

Following the two cycles of treatment with A-007, treating physicians will perform a LEEP at the month 4 visit. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that the LEEP is conducted according to the procedures and guidelines of their institution.
