This study is a prospective, single center, randomized, controlled and open clinical trial initiated by the researchers to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Hetrombopag in the treatment of thrombocytopenia caused by chemotherapy in acute myeloid leukemia. The study focuses on acute myeloid leukemia patients aged 18-70 who have completed induction chemotherapy and achieved complete remission, and have received ≤ 1 course of intensive therapy for consolidation. Patients were randomly divided into the treatment group and the control group through the random number table by 1:1. The treatment group received Hetrombopag and platelet transfusion, and the control group did not receive other platelet raising therapy except platelet transfusion. The study used the proportion of subjects with effective treatment during the randomized treatment period as the main efficacy indicator. 72 patients are planned to be enrolled, with treatment group and control group=1:1.
