A Novel Vaccine for the Treatment of MUC1-expressing Tumor Malignancies
Rationale:

ImMucin was shown to be able to induce a robust cellular immune response mediated via both CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes and therefore, could potentially be more effective in the majority of the target population.

Purpose:

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and initial efficacy of ImMucin, a novel peptide vaccine in metastatic tumors expressing the MUC-1 Tumor Associated Antigen (TAA).
Multiple Myeloma|Tumors
BIOLOGICAL: Peptide Vaccine (MUC-1)
Determine the safety and tolerability of vaccination comprising the ImMucin vaccine|combined with Granulocyte Macrophage-Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF), in patients|with multiple myeloma and other MUC-1 antigen-expressing metastatic carcinomas
Determine objective anti-tumor response in patients treated with this regimen;|Determine immune response in patients treated with this regimen
