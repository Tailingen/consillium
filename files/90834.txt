A Phase 3 Study of Ibrutinib (PCI-32765) Versus Ofatumumab in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
The purpose of the study is to evaluate whether treatment with ibrutinib as a monotherapy results in a clinically significant improvement in progression free survival (PFS) as compared to treatment with ofatumumab in patients with relapsed or refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) or Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL)
Relapsed or Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma
DRUG: ofatumumab|DRUG: ibrutinib
PFS (Progression Free Survival) by Independent Review Committee (IRC), Limited to the Time of Primary Analysis 06 November 2013, The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of ibrutinib compared to ofatumumab based on independent review committee (IRC) assessment of progression-free survival (PFS) according to 2008 IWCLL guidelines., Analysis was conducted after observing approximately 117 PFS events, which occurred about 18 months after the first subject was enrolled.
Overall Response Rate (ORR) by Independent Review Committee (IRC), Overall Response Rate per the IWCLL 2008 criteria as assessed by IRC, limited to the time of primary analysis 06 November 2013, About 18 months after the first subject was enrolled|OS (Overall Survival), OS analysis was conducted at the time of study closure, with no adjustment for crossover from the ofatumumab arm to the ibrutinib arm, OS analysis was conducted at the time of study closure, including up to 6 years of study follow-up|Rate of Sustained Hemoglobin and Platelet Improvement, Proportion of subjects with hemoglobin (HgB) increase \>=20 g/L and platelet (PLT) increase \>=50% over baseline continuously for \>=56 days without blood transfusions or growth factors., From study initiation to study closure, including up to 6 years of study follow-up
Progression Free Survival (PFS) by Investigator With up to 6 Years of Study Follow-up, Long-Term Progression Free Survival as assessed by the investigator with up to 6 years of study follow-up, From study initiation to study closure, including up to 6 years of study follow-up|Overall Response Rate (ORR) by Investigator, Overall response per the IWCLL 2008 criteria as assessed by Investigator with up to 6 years of study follow-up, From study initiation to study closure, including up to 6 years of study follow-up
Study PCYC-1112-CA is a randomized, multicenter, open-label, phase 3 study of the Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) inhibitor Ibrutinib (PCI-32765) versus Ofatumumab in patients with Relapsed or Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma.

Patients randomized to the ofatumumab arm may be considered to receive next subsequent therapy with ibrutinib.
