Prospective Cohort Study on the Safety and Efficacy of Endorobotics for Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (Endorobotics ESD)
This trial is a prospective, single arm study of 30 patients recruited to undergo endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) with a novel robotic assisted technology. It will assess the safety and performance of robotic-assisted endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) of superficial gastric and colorectal lesions that otherwise cannot be optimally and radically removed by snare-based techniques. The primary outcome of the study is rate of complete (R0) resection of the neoplasia.
Gastrointestinal Neoplasm
PROCEDURE: Endoscopic submucosal dissection with EndoRobotics traction device
