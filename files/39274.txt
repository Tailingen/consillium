Tamoxifen With or Without Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Postmenopausal Women With Operable Invasive Breast Cancer
RATIONALE: Estrogen can stimulate the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using tamoxifen may fight breast cancer by blocking the uptake of estrogen. Combining combination chemotherapy with hormone therapy may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of tamoxifen with or without combination chemotherapy in treating postmenopausal women with stage I or stage II breast cancer that can be surgically removed.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: cyclophosphamide|DRUG: fluorouracil|DRUG: methotrexate|DRUG: tamoxifen citrate|PROCEDURE: conventional surgery|RADIATION: radiation therapy
OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the potential benefits of adjuvant tamoxifen with or without cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) in postmenopausal women with stage I-IIIA, unilateral, invasive breast cancer.

OUTLINE: This is a randomized study, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to nodal status (positive vs negative or unknown) and hospital region. Patients undergo surgical resection with or without local radiotherapy, as appropriate. Radiotherapy begins within 8 weeks of surgery for patients randomized to arm I and within 4 weeks after completion of chemotherapy for patients randomized to arm II. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms, preferably within 2 weeks after surgery. Arm I: Beginning within 4 weeks after surgery, patients receive oral tamoxifen daily. Treatment continues for 5 years. Arm II: Beginning within 4 weeks after surgery, patients receive tamoxifen as in arm I and cyclophosphamide IV, methotrexate IV, and fluorouracil IV on day 1 (CMF). Chemotherapy continues every 3 weeks for 6 courses. Patients are followed every 6 months for 5 years and then annually thereafter.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,000 patients will be accrued for this study.
