A Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of ENV-101 (Taladegib) in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors Harboring PTCH1 Loss of Function Mutations
This study employs a 2-stage design that aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ENV- 101, a potent Hedgehog (Hh) pathway inhibitor, in patients with refractory advanced solid tumors characterized by loss of function (LOF) mutations in the Patched-1 (PTCH1) gene. Stage 1 of this study will enroll approximately 44 patients randomized between two dose levels. As appropriate, Stage 2 of the study will expand enrollment based on the results of Stage 1.
Solid Tumors With PTCH1 Loss-of-function Mutations
DRUG: ENV-101 (taladegib)
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is comprised of Complete Response (CR) and Partial Response (PR), measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), as determined by an independent review (confirmed CR or PR will be defined as a repeat assessment performed no less than 28 days after the criteria for response is first met)., through study completion, an average of 6 months
Frequency of Adverse Events (AEs), through study completion, an average of 6 months|Frequency of unacceptable toxicities, Unacceptable toxicities = non-hematologic AEs \>= Grade 3 in severity, not including alopecia and fatigue., through study completion, an average of 6 months|ORR by Investigator, Best overall response of confirmed CR or PR as determined by the treating Investigator using RECIST 1.1., through study completion, an average of 6 months|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), CBR = the proportion of patients who achieved CR, PR or stable disease as determined by the treating Investigator using RECIST 1.1., through study completion, an average of 6 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS = Number of months from initiation of study medication to the date of death due to any cause or last follow up., through study completion, an average of 6 months|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR = the number of months from the start of CR or PR, whichever response is recorded first and subsequently confirmed, to the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is documented or death., through study completion, an average of 6 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS = number of months from initiation of study medication to the earlier of disease progression or death due to any cause or last follow up., through study completion, an average of 6 months|Change in Gli1 inhibition, Percentage change in inhibition of Gli1, a marker for inhibition of the Hedgehog pathway, in skin biopsies., From Baseline through study completion, an average of 6 months|Change in steady-state exposure to study medication, Measurement of trough concentration of study medication in blood at Baseline and the end of each 28-day treatment cycle, From Baseline through study completion, an average of 6 months
