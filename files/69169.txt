Robotic Hemi-Prostatectomy With Urethral Preservation in Low and Intermediate Risk Monolateral Prostate Cancer
On the basis of the now consolidated literature and clinical experience of focal therapies, the execution of partial prostatectomy/hemiprostatectomy with robot-assisted laparoscopic technique can be proposed in a well-selected cohort of patients.

The hypothesis is that with this technique it is possible to achieve excellent levels of disease control, in terms of positive surgical margins (PSM) and biochemical recurrence of the disease (BCR), against a minimal impact as regards postoperative functional outcomes (continence and sexual power).
Prostate Cancer
PROCEDURE: Robotic hemi-prostatectomy with urethral preservation
Feasibility of the robotic hemiprostatectomy technique, Evaluate the feasibility of the robotic hemiprostatectomy technique in both a preclinical and clinical setting as ratio between the number of hemiprostatectomies completed and the total number of prostatectomies performed, Baseline
Safety of the robotic hemiprostatectomy technique, Evaluate the safety of the robotic hemiprostatectomy technique in terms of intra and post-operative complications using the Clavien-Dindo classification.

The Clavien-Dindo classification evaluates severity of complications in 5 groups:

* Grade I: Any deviation from the normal postoperative course without the need for pharmacological treatment or surgical, endoscopic and radiological interventions;
* Grade II: Requiring pharmacological treatment with drugs other than such allowed for grade I complications;
* Grade III: Requiring surgical, endoscopic or radiological intervention (IIIa: Intervention not under general anesthesia; IIIb: Intervention under general anesthesia);
* Grade IV Life-threatening complication requiring IC/ICU-management (IVa: single organ dysfunction; IVb: multiorgan dysfunction);
* Grade V: Death of a patient., 30 days|Positive Surgical Margins (PSMs) rate, Evaluate the oncological efficacy in terms of Positive Surgical Margins (PSMs) at the final histological examination as rate between cases with Positive Surgical Margins over the total of the specimens analyzed by pathologists., 30 days|Biochemical Recurrence (BCR) rate, Evaluate the oncological efficacy in terms of Biochemical Recurrence (BCR) during the follow-up period as rate between patients with BCR over the total of patients in the study group.

The BCR is any rise in the blood level of PSA (prostate-specific antigen) in prostate cancer patients after treatment with surgery or radiation., 5 years|Urinary continence after surgery, Evaluate the functional outcomes in terms of urinary continence during the follow-up period.

The urinary continence will be assessed by the net weight of urine collected in the pad over 24 hours (Pad test).

This outcome will be shown by the mont after the surgery in which the patient reach the complete continence defined as no urine loss at the Pad test., 5 years|Potency recovery after surgery, Evaluate the functional outcomes in terms of potency recovery during the follow-up period.

The potency recovery will be assessed by the International Index of Erectile Function - 5 (IIEF-5) test. This test will be collected every follow-up visit and results will be shown as progression of the IIEF-5 during the 5 years after the surgery.

The IIEF-5 contains 5 items and uses the sum scores and cutoff points to categorize the severity of the erectile dysfunction. This scale ranges from 5 points (severe erectile dysfunction) to 25 points (no erectile dysfunction)., 5 years
