Ovarian Innervation Study in Patients With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a complex endocrine disorder characterized by hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, and ovulatory dysfunction. One of the diagnostic criteria for PCOS is the presence of polycystic ovaries, which are enlarged ovaries with multiple follicles on ultrasound. However, the mechanisms that lead to the development of polycystic ovaries in PCOS are not completely understood. One potential area of investigation is the role of ovarian innervation in the pathophysiology of PCOS. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the ovarian innervation in PCOS patients through ovarian biopsy sampling.
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
PROCEDURE: Ovary Biopsie
Quantify nerve fibers, identify and quantify the nerve fibers in the ovarian stroma and follicles, day 0|Identifying nerual markers, Identification of neural markers such as Protein Gene Product 9.5 (PGP 9.5), by useing antibodies (es. neurotransmitters such as tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and neuropeptide Y)., day 0
This is a cross-sectional study that will involve the recruitment of patients diagnosed with PCOS. The study will be conducted at a tertiary care center Koco Gliozheni Maternity, Faculty of Medicine of Tirana, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology with expertise in gynecology and endocrinology and will then be examined with the aid of the department of Biology and Physiology of the University of Perugia. The study protocol will be approved by the institutional ethics committee, and written informed consent will be obtained from all participants.
