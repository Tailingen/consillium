Erlotinib Pharmacokinetics During Doxycycline Treatment for Erlotinib-induced Rash
A side effect occurring in a majority of patients taking erlotinib (Tarceva®) consists of a skin rash. Sometimes, symptoms associated with the rash necessitate erlotinib dose reduction or discontinuation. Some physicians have successfully treated the erlotinib-induced rash with doxycycline. At the same time, it has been observed that in patients who develop the erlotinib rash, the cancers respond better to erlotinib treatment. This research study is designed to determine how well doxycycline treats the erlotinib rash and whether doxycycline affects the blood levels of erlotinib.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: doxycycline
The primary objective of this study is to determine whether administration of doxycycline affects erlotinib PK, 14 days
Secondarily, this study aims to investigate the relationship between erlotinib AUC and rash severity and to evaluate the efficacy of doxycycline in rash management., 14 days
