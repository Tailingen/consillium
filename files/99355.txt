Efficacy and Safety of Paricalcitol in the Reduction of Secondary Hyperparathyroidism After Kidney Transplantation.
To demonstrate the superiority of paricalcitol treatment at early renal post-transplantation (M6) in the control of iPTH (Intact parathyroid hormone) compared to the use of vitamin D nutritional supplements (calcifediol) in patients with renal transplantation.
