A Dose-Escalation Study for Patients With Advanced Cancer
This study is being conducted to determine the safety of LY2523355 for the treatment of advanced and/or metastatic cancer (including Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma).
Advanced Cancer
DRUG: pegfilgrastim|DRUG: LY2523355
Recommended Dose and Schedule for Phase 2 Studies, The recommended dose and schedule for Phase 2 studies is defined as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). MTD is defined as the dose level at which no more than 2 dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), no more than 3 dose reductions (DR) or dose omissions (DO) and no more than 1 DLT plus 2 DR/DO occurred. DLT is defined as an adverse event (AE) occurring in Cycle 1 with the following criteria according to the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v3.0: Any ≥Grade 3 nonhematological toxicity (except nausea/vomiting or diarrhea controlled with treatment or fatigue); ≥Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, or Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding; Grade 4 hematological toxicity of \>5 days duration, excluding thrombocytopenia; febrile neutropenia., Cycle 1 (21 days): Day 1, 5 and 9, any AE reported
Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Effects, Clinically significant effects were defined as serious and other non-serious adverse events (AEs). A summary of serious and other non-serious AEs is located in the Reported Adverse Events module., Baseline to Cycle 38 (21-day cycles): daily for AEs|Pharmacokinetics Maximum Concentration (Cmax), Single Dose, Plasma Cmax following a single dose of LY2523355 at each dose level across all schedules and in the presence or absence of pegfilgrastim (PEG)., Cycle 1 Day 1 of 21-day cycle: Predose, 1 hour (hr), 2,4,6,8,24,48 and 72 hr postdose|Pharmacokinetics Maximum Concentration (Cmax), Multiple Dose, Plasma Cmax following multiple doses of LY2523355 at each dose level across all schedules and in the presence or absence of pegfilgrastim (PEG)., Cycle 1 Days 4, 5, 8 or 9 of 21-day cycle:Predose, 1 hour (hr), 2,4,6,8,24,48 and 72 hr postdose|Pharmacokinetics Area Under the Concentration-time Curve (AUC), Single Dose, Plasma AUC from time zero to infinity \[AUC(0-∞)\] and AUC from time zero to 24 hours post-dose \[AUC(0-24)\] following a single dose of LY2523355 at each dose level across all schedules and in the presence or absence of pegfilgrastim (PEG)., Cycle 1 Days 4, 5, 8 or 9 of 21-day cycle:Predose, 1 hour (hr), 2,4,6,8,24,48 and 72 hr postdose|Pharmacokinetic Areas Under the Concentration Time Curve (AUC), Multiple Dose, Plasma AUC from time zero to infinity (0-∞) and AUC from time zero to 24 hours (0-24) post-dose following multiple doses of LY2523355 at each dose level across all schedules and in the presence or absence of pegfilgrastim (PEG)., Cycle 1 Days 4, 5, 8 or 9 of 21-day cycle:Predose, 1 hour (hr), 2,4,6,8,24,48 and 72 hr postdose|Number of Participants With Tumor Response, Response was assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria and the Revised International Working Group (IWG) lymphoma response criteria for lymphoma patients. Complete Response (CR) was defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 millimeter (mm) and normalization of tumor marker level of non-target lesions; Partial Response (PR) was defined as at least a 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD) was defined as at least 20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions and minimum 5 mm increase over nadir. Tumor response is CR + PR., Baseline to measured disease progression or discontinuation up to Cycle 38 (21-day cycles)
This study is a multi-center, non-randomized, open label, dose-escalation, Phase 1 study of intravenous LY2523355 in patients with advanced and/or metastatic cancer (including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) for whom no treatment of higher priority exists.
