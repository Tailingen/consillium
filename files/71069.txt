A Comparison of the Effect of 1.5 Versus 3% NaCl on Brain Relaxation and Microcirculation
Hyperosmotic solutions of 1.5% and 3% NaCl are equally effective for brain relaxation and microcirculation during brain surgery. The effect of 1.5% NaCl on postoperative natremia and natriuresis is less pronounced.
Brain Tumors
PROCEDURE: 1.5% NaCl|PROCEDURE: 3% NaCl
Changes in brain microcirculation, measurement by SDF probe MicroVision, from dura opening till the end of tumor resection
Changes in natremia, mmol/l, 1 hour after hypertonic NaCl infusion|Changes in natremia, mmol/l, 5 min after the end of surgery|Changes in osmolarity, mosm/l, 1 hour after hypertonic NaCl infusion|Changes in osmolarity, mosm/l, 5 min after the end of surgery|Concentration of natrium in cerebrospinal fluid, mmol/l, after dura opening
Changes in diuresis, ml/hour, at the time of extubation
All the patients meeting the study criteria will be randomized into two groups. After standardized induction to general anesthesia all patients will be given the infusion of hyperosmotic NaCl 5 ml/kg/BW during 30 min, group A 1.5% NaCl, group B 3% NaCl. Corticosteroids will be administered as usually. After dura opening the brain relaxation score will be assessed by surgeon (1 = completely relaxed, 2 = satisfactorily relaxed, 3 = firm brain, 4 = bulging brain), and the first measurement of the brain microcirculation provided by use of SDF probe in the area of the healthy brain, and of perifocal oedema. Both sites of investigation will be marked for the second measurement, which will be done after the end of tumor resection. Laboratory examinations: natremia preoperatively, natremia and osmolarity peroperatively 1 hour after NaCl infusion and at the end of surgery. Concentration of natrium will be examined in CSF after dura opening. Anesthesia management will be according to the standardised protocol, the patients will be awaken and extubated after the end of the procedure at the operating theatre.
