SIR-Spheres® Microspheres Versus Transarterial Chemoembolisation in Patients With Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This study is open to patients with primary HCC who cannot be treated by potentially curative treatment modalities, such as surgical resection, liver transplantation or percutaneous ablation.

Patients that satisfy the study eligibility criteria will be randomised in a 1: 1 ratio to receive either Radioembolisation with SIR-Spheres Microspheres or the standardised Transarterial Chemoembolisation procedure.

Study Objectives

This study will evaluate and compare quality of life as well as safety and efficacy of RE or TACE in patients with unresectable HCC. Patients will be followed for a minimum of 12 months or until death wherever possible in the evaluation of the primary and secondary objectives of this study.
