Dose Monitoring of Busulfan and Combination Chemotherapy in Hodgkin or Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Undergoing Stem Cell Transplant
This clinical trial studies personalized dose monitoring of busulfan and combination chemotherapy in treating patients with Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin lymphoma undergoing stem cell transplant. Giving chemotherapy before a stem cell transplant stops the growth of cancer cells by stopping them from dividing or killing them. After treatment, stem cells are collected from the patient's peripheral blood or bone marrow and stored. The stem cells are then returned to the patient to replace the blood-forming cells that were destroyed by the chemotherapy. Monitoring the dose of busulfan may help doctors deliver the most accurate dose and reduce toxicity in patients undergoing stem cell transplant.

DRUG: busulfan|DRUG: etoposide|DRUG: cyclophosphamide|PROCEDURE: peripheral blood stem cell transplantation|PROCEDURE: autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
Feasibility of performing real-time TDM, determined by the proportion of enrolled patients who are able to have an area under curve (AUC) for busulfan calculated, Up to day -6
Incidence of adverse events including mucositis, liver toxicity, seizures, and pulmonary toxicity, graded using NCI CTCAE version 4.0, Incidence of adverse events will be compared to historic controls. For comparison, categorical variables will be summarized as frequency counts and percentages and compared between historical controls that were treated with weight-based busulfan with those enrolled as part of the clinical trial who receive busulfan TDM. Continuous variables will be summarized as the mean, standard deviation, median, and range and compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum test., Up to 100 days after treatment|Proportion of patients who would not have achieved desired busulfan level with weight-based busulfan dosing, Up to day -6
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the feasibility of real-time therapeutic dose monitoring (TDM) for once daily intravenously (IV) busulfan administration as part of a preparative regimen for patients with lymphoma undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To compare the incidence of adverse events including mucositis, liver toxicity, seizures, and pulmonary toxicity with TDM of once daily IV busulfan compared to historic controls.

II. To compare the 6-month progression-free survival (PFS), with TDM of once daily IV busulfan compared to historic controls.

III. To determine the proportion of patients who would not have achieved desired busulfan level with weight-based busulfan dosing and therefore required TDM.

OUTLINE:

Patients receive busulfan intravenously (IV) over 3 hours on days -9 to -6, etoposide IV continuously over 24-36 hours on days -5 and -4, and cyclophosphamide IV over 4 hours on days -3 and -2. Patients then undergo autologous stem cell transplant on day 0.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 6 months.
