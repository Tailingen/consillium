The Efficacy and Safety Study of TORIPALIMAB INJECTION Combined With Chemotherapy for Nasophapyngeal Cancer
This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center, double blinded, Phase III study to determine the efficacy and safety of TORIPALIMAB INJECTIO（JS001） in combination with gemcitabine/cisplatin compared with placebo in combination with gemcitabine/cisplatin as first-line treatment in patients with histological/cytological confirmation of recurrent or metastatic NPC. The primary endpoint is PFS in all patients. Approximately 280 patients who fulfill all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two treatment arms. patients will be randomly assigned to the combination of JS001 (Arm A) or placebo (Arm B) with gemcitabine and cisplatin given every 3 weeks (Q3W) in 3-week cycles.

Total 289 patients were enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the group of JS001 (Arm A) with gemcitabine and cisplatin or placebo (Arm B) with gemcitabine and cisplatin every 3 weeks (Q3W) in the 'during chemotherapy' phase. During the 'post-chemotherapy' phase, patients randomized to Arm A or Arm B will continue treatment with JS001 or placebo as maintenance therapy Q3W until excessive toxicity or progressive disease, withdrawal of consent or Investigator's judgement or a maximum of 2 years. Tumor evaluation scans will be performed at screening (as baseline) then every 6weeks in the first 12 months then every 9 weeks thereafter until objective disease progression. The primary objective is to compare PFS as assessed by the IRC in ITT population (all randomized patients).
