Combined HAIC, Lenvatinib and Cadonilimab As Conversion Therapy for Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This is an open-label, single-arm, phase 2 study. The purpose of study is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy combined with lenvatinib and cadonilimab as conversion therapy for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.

PROCEDURE: HAIC|DRUG: Lenvatinib plus cadonilimab
Number of Patients Amendable to Curative Surgical Interventions, Number of patients amendable to curative surgical interventions defined as number of patients receiving curative surgical resection, transplantation, or ablation after successful down-sizing of tumor(s) by intervention., from the date of first treatment to the date of last treatment, an average of 3 years
overall response rate (ORR) measured by mRECIST criteria, Complete response (CR): Disappearance of any intra-tumoral arterial enhancement in all target lesions; Partial response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of viable (enhancement in the arterial phase) target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of the diameters of target lesions; Stable disease (SD): Any cases that do not qualify for either partial response or progressive disease; Progressive disease (PD): An increase of at least 20% in the sum of the diameters of viable (enhancing) target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of the diameters of viable (enhancing) target lesions recorded since treatment started.

ORR=CR+PR., from the date of first treatment to radiographically documented progression according to mRECIST, assessed up to 3 years|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS): measured from date of first treatment to the date of death from any cause. Participants alive or lost to follow-up will be censored at the date of their last visit., from the date of first treatment to the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 5 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), measured from the date of first treatment to radiographically documented progression according to mRECIST 1.1 or death from any cause (whichever occurs first). Participants alive and without disease progression or lost to follow-up will be censored at the date of their last radiographic assessment., from the date of first treatment to radiographically documented progression according to mRECIST 1.1 or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 3 years|Time to progression (TTP), Time to progression (TTP): measured from the date of first treatment to radiographically documented progression according to mRECIST 1.1. This does not include death from any cause., from the date of first treatment to radiographically documented progression according to mRECIST, assessed up to 3 years|Time to intrahepatic tumor progression (TTITP), Time to intrahepatic tumor progression (TTITP): measured from the date of first treatment to radiographically documented intrahepatic tumor progression according to mRECIST 1.1. This does not include death from any cause., from the date of first treatment to radiographically documented intrahepatic tumor progression according to mRECIST, assessed up to 3 years|Incidence of Study-Related Adverse Events, Incidence, nature, and severity of adverse events graded according to the United States National Cancer Institute The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE 5.0), from the date of first treatment to 90 days after last treatment, around 3 years and 90 days|Pathological complete response (pCR), Pathological response is assessed as the percentage of surface with non-viable cancer cells (represented by necrosis or fibrosis, the ultimate stage of necrosis) in relation to the total tumor area and will be equal to: 100% - viable cancer cells (%). If there are multiple tumors, the mean percentage will be used., from the date of first study treatment to radiographically documented progression according to mRECIST 1.1 or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 5 years|Disease control rate (DCR), Percentage of patients that had a CR, PR, or SD â‰¥ 6 months per mRECIST, from the date of first treatment to radiographically documented response according to mRECIST, assessed up to 3 years|Duration of response (DoR), Defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until the first documented sign of disease progression (PD) or death from any cause, from the date of first documented evidence of CR or PR to first documented sign of PD or death from any cause according to mRECIST 1.1, assessed up to 3 years|Quality of Life (QoL) after treatment, The life quality of every subject is assessed every 3 months during follow up according to the 45-item FACT-Hep questionnaire, which assesses generic HRQL concerns and disease-specific issues., assessed form the date of first followup to radiographically documented progression or or death from any cause, up to 3 years
Cadonilimab is the world's first PD-1/CTLA-4 bispecific antibody tumor immunotherapy new drug, a tetrameric PD-1/CTLA-4 bispecific antibody, which can only bind to TIL tetravalent co-expressing PD-1 and CTLA-4. This design not only retains the efficacy observed in the combination therapy of PD-1 plus CTLA-4 inhibitors, but also reduces the risk of activated T cells attacking healthy tissues, thereby alleviating the toxicity problem outside the tumor. On June 29, 2022, the National Medical Products Administration of China approved the new drug Cadonilimab for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer patients who have failed platinum-based chemotherapy. Currently, a phase II clinical study of lenvatinib combined with Cadonilimab systemic treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma is underway, and preliminary results reveal that in 30 enrolled patients, the ORR was 44.4%, the DCR was 77.8%, the treatment-related adverse reaction rate was 83.3%, but the incidence of grade 3 or above adverse reactions was only 26.7%. The safety of this antibody in patients is generally good. This study intends to evaluate the safety and efficacy of HAIC combined with lenvatinib and cadonilimab as a conversion regimen in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.
