Lambda z was determined from the terminal slope of the log-transformed serum concentration curve using linear regression method., Day 1: within 2 hours prior to and at the end of the 1-hour infusion, and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 12 hours after the end of the infusion|Dose Normalized Area Under the Serum Concentration-Time Curve From Time Zero to the Last Sampling Time (AUC0-t/Dose) of Avelumab, AUC0-t/Dose was defined as area under the serum concentration versus time curve from time of dosing to the time of the last measurable concentration divided by dose. AUC0-t/Dose was measured in (microgram\*hour per milliliter)/(milligram per kilogram) (mcg\*h/mL)/(mg/kg)., Day 1: within 2 hours prior to and at the end of the 1-hour infusion, and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 12 hours after the end of the infusion|Dose Normalized Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve Over the Dosing Interval (AUCtau/Dose) of Avelumab, AUCtau/Dose was calculated by as dose normalized area under the serum concentration-time curve from time zero to the end of the dosing interval (tau). AUCtau was calculated using the mixed log linear trapezoidal rule., Day 1: within 2 hours prior to and at the end of the 1-hour infusion, and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 12 hours after the end of the infusion|Dose Normalized Maximum Observed Serum Concentration (Cmax/Dose) of Avelumab, Cmax/Dose was defined as maximum observed serum concentration divided by dose., Day 1: within 2 hours prior to and at the end of the 1-hour infusion, and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 12 hours after the end of the infusion
Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Treatment Related TEAEs According to National Cancer Institute- Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.03 (NCI-CTCAE v4.03), An Adverse event (AE) was defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug or worsening of pre-existing medical condition, whether or not related to study drug. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect or was otherwise considered medically important. TEAEs were defined as events that emerge during treatment having been absent pre-treatment, or worsen relative to the pre-treatment state and with onset dates occurring within the first dosing day of study treatment until 30 days after the last dose of study treatment. TEAEs include both Serious TEAEs and non-serious TEAEs. Treatment-related TEAEs: reasonably related to the study intervention., Time from first study treatment up to 139 weeks|Number of Participants With at Least 1 Positive Anti-Avelumab Antibodies (ADA), Serum samples were analyzed by a validated electrochemiluminescence immunoassay to detect the presence of antidrug antibodies (ADA). Number of participants with ADA positive results for Avelumab were reported., Time from first study treatment up to 139 weeks
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and pharmacokinetics (PK) of Avelumab monotherapy in Chinese subjects.
