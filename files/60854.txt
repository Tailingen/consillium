SBRT With S1 Combined With Endostar in the Treatment of Lung Cancer
Human recombinant endostatin preclinical studies have shown that the drug can inhibit endothelial cell proliferation, angiogenesis and tumor growth, still can directly induce lung cancer cell apoptosis, multiple clinical studies in human recombinant endostatin combined with chemotherapy treatment showed good antitumor efficacy and good safety.S1 is an oral fluorouracil derivative and an improved preparation of the antitumor drug tegafur.Multiple clinical studies have reported that S1 alone or S1 combined with chemotherapy is effective in Non small cell lung cancer(NSCLC).Unfortunately, none of the prospective clinical studies to date have systematically validated the safety and efficacy of antiangiogenic drugs combined with chemotherapy in patients with advanced pulmonary SCC.The investigators expect that endu combined with S1 will increase the efficacy of advanced lung squamous cell carcinoma.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the objective remission rate and safety of entu combined with oral S1 in the treatment of advanced lung squamous cell carcinoma.
Radiotherapy Side Effect
DRUG: Endostar
OS, Overall survival, 3 years|PFS, Progression-free survival, the time interval of disease progression since the date of diagnosis
LCR, Local control rate criteria for short-term efficacy., 2 years|Adverse reactions, adverse events and laboratory tests were graded according to NCI CTC AE 5.0, 2 years|Qol, Quality of life, 2 years
In this study, the investigatorse enrolled patients with advanced lung squamous cell carcinoma to explore the safety and efficacy of sequential local radiotherapy combined with endodontic therapy.Plan to enroll 60 cases.For those who meet the inclusion criteria, medical history collection, physical examination, hematological examination and general imaging examination shall be completed before inclusion.Radiotherapy was performed with a cyberknife or accelerator stereotactic radiotherapy, which lasted 3-10 days.After the end of radiotherapy,S1 60mg, BID, day 1-28, as taken orally, and repeated every 6 weeks, with concurrent Endostar therapy: 210mg was used by intravenous infusion for 7 consecutive days during each cycle of chemotherapy, and 30mg was used every 24 hours.Treatment-related toxicity, treatment response and survival were followed up during treatment.Drug treatment until the tumor progresses, or there is an intolerable treatment-related toxicity, or no tolerance to further treatment.The treatment lasts for up to 3 years with good toxicity tolerance.During the treatment, the dose of teggio and endu is not adjusted. If serious adverse reactions occur, the drug should be treated actively and delayed.If the investigator determines that the treatment-related toxicity cannot be tolerated, the treatment is discontinued.
