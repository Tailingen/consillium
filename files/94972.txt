Effect of Regorafenib on Digoxin and Rosuvastatin in Patients With Advanced Solid Malignant Tumors.
Evaluate the effect of regorafenib on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin (P-gp substrate : P-glycoprotein) and rosuvastatin (BCRP substrate: Breast cancer resistant protein) by comparing their Area under time curve (AUC(0-24)) and maximum drug concentration (Cmax) on Day -7 and Cycle 1 or Cycle 2 Day 15 of regorafenib in cancer patients
Neoplasms
DRUG: Digoxin|DRUG: Rosuvastatin|DRUG: Regorafenib (Stivarga, BAY73-4506)
Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to 24 hours (AUC(0-24)) for Digoxin, On Pre-Cycle Day -7 and on Cycle 1 Day15 or Cycle 2 Day 15|Maximum drug concentration (Cmax) in plasma for Digoxin, On Pre-Cycle Day -7 and on Cycle 1 Day15 or Cycle 2 Day 15|Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to 24 hours (AUC(0-24)) for rosuvastatin, On Pre-Cycle Day -7 and on Cycle 1 Day15 or Cycle 2 Day 15|Maximum drug concentration (Cmax) in plasma for rosuvastatin, On Pre-Cycle Day -7 and on Cycle 1 Day15 or Cycle 2 Day 15
Tumor Response following RECIST criteria, From first dose up to 3 months after end of treatment|Number of participants with adverse events as a measure of safety and tolerability, Up to 30 days after last dose|Number of participants with drug related adverse events as a measure of safety and tolerability, Up to 30 days after last dose
