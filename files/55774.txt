A Safety and Efficacy Study of Carfilzomib and Pomalidomide With Dexamethasone in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
This is a dose finding pilot study to evaluate the safety and determine the maximum tolerated dose of the combination of carfilzomib and pomalidomide with dexamethasone (CPD) in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma followed by a phase II expansion at the MTD to evaluate efficacy.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Carfilzomib|DRUG: Pomalidomide|DRUG: Dexamethasone
Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, Review of adverse events for safety and to determine the maximum tolerated dose of the combination treatment., Throughout treatment, estimated at 2-12 months per patient|Overall Response in Phase II, Overall Response (SD, MR, PR, VGPR, CR, sCR), Every 28 days while on treatment (estimated at 2- 12 months per patient)
Overall Response in Phase I, Overall response (SD, MR, PR, VGPR, CR, sCR), Every 28 days while on treatment (estimated at 2- 12 months per patient)|Time to Progression, Every 28 days while on treatment (estimated at 2-12 months per patient)|Progression Free Survival, throughout follow up (every 2-3 months for 2 years)|Time to next therapy, throughout follow up (every 2-3 months for 2 years)
This is a dose finding pilot study to evaluate the safety and determine the maximum tolerated dose of the combination of carfilzomib and pomalidomide with dexamethasone (CPD) in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma followed by a phase II expansion at the MTD to evaluate efficacy. The study will explore the efficacy of CPD including overall response, time to progression, progression free survival, and time to next therapy.
