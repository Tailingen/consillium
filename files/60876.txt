the Effect of Diane-35 Pretreatment on In-vitro Fertilization Outcome for Patients With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome is the most common endocrine disorder in women, is estimated to affect more than 5% of the population and is associated with chronically elevated serum androgen concentrations.Evidence suggests that polycystic ovary syndrome has a negative impact on pregnancy outcomes, with an increased risk of gestational diabetes, hypertensive disease during pregnancy,and preterm birth,which is partially related with the hyperandrogenic environment.Diane-35 has been proved to be the most effective anti-androgenic drug.At present, there is no direct evidence that Diane-35 has a positive effect on the clinical outcome of polycystic ovary syndrome patients undergoing In-vitro fertilization/Intracytoplasmic sperm injection.
