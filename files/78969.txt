French national multicentric phase III trial evaluating chemotherapy with Folfirinox or gemcitabine in locally advanced pancreatic carcinoma.
Pancreatic Cancer|Carcinoma
DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Folinic Acid|DRUG: 5-Fluoro-uracil|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Irinotecan|DRUG: L-folinic
Progression-Free-Survival (PFS), To compare Progression-Free-Survival (PFS) between the two treatment arms, From randomization until disease progression or date of death, assessed up until to 128 weeks
Composite index for treatment early severe toxicity, Biliary tract infection Grade 3-4 + any grade 5 toxicities + chemotherapy interruption for toxicity during the first four cycles., First four chemotherapy cycles, 16 weeks|Adverse events (NCI-CTCAE version 4.0); observance of chemotherapy, Observance of chemotherapy, During treatment phase, 24 weeks|Overall Survival, The overall survival is the length of time from randomization that patients enrolled in the study are still alive. The outcome is to evaluate whether SRBT improves overall survival compared to standard of care., Until death, assessed up 128 weeks after randomization|Progression-free survival: pattern of failure, The progression-free survival is the length of time during and after the treatment of a disease that a patient lives with the disease but it does not get worse., Until Disease Progression, assessed uo until 128 weeks after randomization|Percentage of secondarily curative-intent surgery, Percentage of patients who will undergo an exeresis of their pancreatic tumor, with R0 resection confirmed by anatomopathic pathology., Until surgery, if applicable, up until 128 weeks after randomization|Objective tumour response, disease control and their duration, Objective tumour response, disease control and their duration (RECIST version 1.1),, Until disease progression or date of death, assessed up until 128 weeks after randomization|Time to treatment failure, Time to treatment failure, From randomisation to the end of treatment|Quality of life questionnaire - Core 30 (QLQ-C30), Developed by the EORTC, this self-reported questionnaire assesses the health-related quality of life of cancer patients in clinical trials. The questionnaire includes five functional scales (physical, everyday activity, cognitive, emotional, and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting), a health/quality of life overall scale, and a number of additional elements assessing common symptoms (including dyspnea, loss of appetite, insomnia, constipation, and diarrhea), as well as, the perceived financial impact of the disease. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level., assessed up until 128 weeks after randomization
Comparative interventional prospective phase 3, randomized, open-label, multicentric trial comparing chemotherapy with Folfirinox to Gemcitabine in locally advanced pancreatic carcinoma.
