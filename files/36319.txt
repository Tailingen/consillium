Adjuvant Radiotherapy Versus Observation After Radical Cystectomy in High Risk Urothelial Bladder Cancer
This is a prospective randomized clinical trial in high risk urothelial bladder cancer to compare adjuvant radiotherapy versus observation after radical cyctectomy. This is to clarify the benefit of adjuvant radiotherapy while limiting gastrointestinal toxicities for patients with pathological high-risk bladder cancer through assessing locoregional control (LRC).
High-Risk Cancer|Urothelial Carcinoma Bladder
RADIATION: Adjuvant Radiotherapy
Local Control, 2-year local-regional control rate, Two year
Disease Free Survival, 2-year disease free survival rate, Two year
This is prospective randomized trial in high risk urothelial bladder cancer that includes 2 arms. The randomization will be done by permuted block method to 2 equal comparable groups. The total number of subjects will be 50 in each arm (Total=100 subjects).

This study include patients who may receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy \[Gemcitabine+Cisplatin\]) or not.

Arm (1) in this study (N=50) will received irradiation of both the bladder tumor bed and pelvic lymph nodes using IMRT technique. For Arm (2) (N=50) will undergo observation following radical cystectomy.
