S0709: Erlotinib With or Without Carboplatin and Paclitaxel in Stage IIIB or Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
RATIONALE: Erlotinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving erlotinib together with carboplatin and paclitaxel may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well erlotinib works when given alone or together with carboplatin and paclitaxel in treating patients with stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.
Lung Cancer
DRUG: carboplatin|DRUG: erlotinib hydrochloride|DRUG: paclitaxel
Selection of One of Two Treatment Regimens (Erlotinib Hydrochloride With or Without Carboplatin and Paclitaxel) for Further Study in a Phase III Trial, Based on Median Progression-free Survival for ≥ 3 Months, From date of registration to 3 years or death, whichever comes first
Response Rate (Confirmed and Unconfirmed, Complete and Partial Response) in a Subset of Patients With Measurable Disease, Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI:

Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., From date of registration to 3 years or death, whichever comes first
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To select a regimen (erlotinib hydrochloride with or without carboplatin and paclitaxel) for further testing against standard treatment, based on median progression-free survival for ≥ 3 months, in patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer with a Zubrod performance status of 2.

Secondary

* To assess the feasibility of selecting patients for a trial based on central EGFR testing of serum in a cooperative group setting.
* To evaluate the objective tumor response rates (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and partial response), in a subset of patients with measurable disease.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

* Arm I: Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride once daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
* Arm II: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and oral erlotinib hydrochloride once daily on days 2-16. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses. Beginning in course 5 and for all subsequent courses, patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride alone on days 1-21. Courses with erlotinib hydrochloride repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years.
