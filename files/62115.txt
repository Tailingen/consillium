Extract from the mushroom Agaricus blazei Murill har been shown to have strong immunomodulating properties both in cell cultures, animal models and in humans. Furthermore antitumor properties have been shown in animal models, among them in mice with multiple myeloma.

DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Intake of 60 ml placebo daily in addition to chemotherapy|DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Intake of 60 ml agaricus daily in addition to chemotherapy
Cytokine levels in serum, 7 weeks
Quality of Life, 4 months
Patients who are scheduled to undergo high dose chemotherapy for multiple myeloma will receive in addition in a double blinded manner 60 ml of agaricus extract or placebo once daily from the start of stem cell mobilizing therapy until one week after the end of aplasia after high dose melphalan.
