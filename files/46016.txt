A Trial of CMNa Combined With Preoperatie Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy for Locally Advanced ESCC
This is a perspective, multicenter,single arm, open label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment with CMNa combined with preoperatie concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced squamous cell esophageal carcinoma . Analyses of primary objective (pathologic Complete Response) will be done as defined in the protocol.
Esophageal Neoplasms
DRUG: Sodium Glycididazole
pathologic Complete Response, TRG-cited from Mandard AM, Dalibard F, Mandard JC, Marnay J, Henry-Amar M, Petiot JF, Roussel A, Jacob JH, Segol P, Samama G, Pathologic assessment of tumor regression after preoperative chemoradiotherapy of esophageal carcinoma. Cancer, 73, 2680-2686, 1994., 1 months
Overall Survival, 36 months|Disease-Free Survival, 36 months
The primary end ponit of this study is pathological complete response.And the primary hypothesis is the CMNa will improve patholofical response rate and thus improve OS„ÄÅDFS. Assuming bilateral a=0.05, statistical power of 80%.The total sample size is 40 cases.
