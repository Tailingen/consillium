Safety Study of IL-21/Ipilimumab Combination in the Treatment of Melanoma
The purpose of this study is to determine whether the combination of interleukin-21 (IL-21) and Ipilimumab in subjects with melanoma is safe, and provide preliminary information on the clinical benefits of the combination compared with Ipilimumab alone

Part1 (Dose Escalation): The Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BMS-982470 using 2 distinct schedules when administered in combination with Ipilimumab, Based on the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) rate, Within the first 63 days|Part 2 (Cohort Escalation): Safety and tolerability of the MTD dose for each of the schedules, Based on medical review of AE reports and the results of vital sign measurements, physical examinations, medical history, and clinical laboratory tests, 84 days on treatment
