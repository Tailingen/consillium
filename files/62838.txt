Radioactive Holmium Microspheres for the Treatment of Liver Metastases
The HEPAR study is aimed at determining the safety of radioactive holmium containing microspheres for the treatment of tumors in the liver. These microspheres will be administered by infusion in the liver artery using a arterial catheter in the femoral artery.
