Low Pressure Versus Standard Pressure Pneumoperitoneum in Laparoscopic Nephrectomy
Laparoscopic nephrectomies are commonly performed these days and are considered gold standard for both benign and malignant diseases as well as for donor nephrectomies. Despite being a widely performed surgery worldwide still there are areas of uncertainties due to lack of evidences. One of such area of dilemma is the optimum pressure of pneumoperitoneum. This study aims to identify if lower pressure of pneumoperitoneum is safe during laparoscopic nephrectomies.

This is a hospital based prospective randomized control study. All the patients undergoing laparoscopic nephrectomies at department of urology and kidney transplant surgery will be eligible for study. Patients will be divided into low pressure or standard pressure pneumoperitoneum by simple random sampling and comparison of various intraoperative and post-operative parameters will be done to assess the safety of low pressure pneumoperitoneum
Non-Functioning Kidney|Renal Cell Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic Surgery
To compare the safety of low pressure versus standard pressure pneumoperitoneum in laparoscopic nephrectomy, Complications between two groups will determine the safety of procedure., 30 days perioperative period|To compare the efficacy of low pressure versus standard pressure pneumoperitoneum in laparoscopic nephrectomy, Operative time will help to determine efficacy of treatment., 30 days perioperative period
