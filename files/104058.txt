This study is an real-world, multicenter, case control study about comparing pegylated liposomal doxorubicin Efficacy and safety of epirubicin in neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. As this trial is a retrospective real-world study, investigator have given patients the dose of trial drugs based on real-world principles of diagnosis and treatment and their clinical experience. This trial only collects and analyzes patients' clinical medications, and does not interfere with patients' real-world diagnosis and treatment. A total of 1050 breast cancer patients are collecting from seven centers. 200 cases in neoadjuvant and 850 cases in adjuvant group. The follow-up examinations and assessment of the subjects were followed by real-world medical treatment routines and the visits were completed according to the routine of treatment. Related check and assessments and collect the following data: follow-up 3years or until the disease recurs (whichever occurs first). Adverse events: remission or stability of adverse events caused by follow-up to treatment in the adjuvant treatment group, follow-up for 3 years or until recurrence of the disease in the neoadjuvant treatment group (whichever first occurred).
