Homoharringtonine in Treating Patients With Refractory Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of homoharringtonine in treating patients who have refractory acute promyelocytic leukemia.
Leukemia
DRUG: homoharringtonine|PROCEDURE: chemotherapy
Safety by physical examinations, vital signs, laboratory studies (routine hematology, clinical chemistry, pharmacokinetics, urinalysis, chest x-ray, and EKG), and solicited and unsolicited adverse events|Efficacy by response to treatment
Pharmacokinetics|Duration of treatment response|Survival|Induction mortality|Hospitalizations
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the safety of salvage therapy comprising homoharringtonine in patients with refractory acute promyelocytic leukemia.
* Determine the antileukemic efficacy of this drug in these patients.

OUTLINE: Patients receive remission induction therapy comprising homoharringtonine (HH) IV continuously on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity until a complete remission (CR) is achieved or the patient fails to respond after 3 courses.

Patients who achieve a CR during induction therapy receive maintenance therapy comprising HH IV continuously on days 1-7. Maintenance treatment repeats every 4 weeks for a total of 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients are followed at 4 weeks.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
