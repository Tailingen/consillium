Extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma (ENKTL) is a rare and aggressive lymphoma subtype, but standard front-line therapy has not been established. The clinical outcome of patients (pts) with ENKTL after the treatment of conventional chemotherapy, especially pts with advanced stage, was generally poor. Therefore, high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) as a consolidation could be one of promising strategies to improve the outcome of ENKTL. However, there have been few studies reporting the survival outcome or prognostic significances of front-line ASCT in pts with ENKTL. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the outcome of patients with advanced-stage ENKTL who had undergone front-line ASCT.
