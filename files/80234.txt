CetuGEX™: Phase 1 Study in Cancer Patients
This was a prospective, open label, multicenter study evaluating the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of CetuGEX™ after intravenous administration in patients with EGFR positive, locally advanced and/or metastatic solid cancers. The effect of CetuGEX™ on the development of anti-drug antibodies and on tumour response was also evaluated.
Solid Tumors
DRUG: CetuGEX™
Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) assessed with the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 3.0, TEAE were coded by use of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 13.1, throughout the study until 28±2 days after last infusion|Incidence of clinically relevant abnormal clinical laboratory parameters, graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 3.0, from first infusion until 28±2 days following the last infusion|Dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), DLTs were defined as drug-related:

* Hematological or non-hematological toxicity grade 3 (excl. rash) or 4 excluding inadequately treated nausea and vomiting;
* In case of skin reaction (rash) grade 4, from first infusion until 28±2 days following the last infusion|Changes of corrected QT interval (QTc) duration, by use of 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECG), from first infusion until 28±2 days following the last infusion|To define the recommended phase II dose and regimen, Defining a recommended dose for a Phase II study was possible based on the available PK data in combination with the safety and activity data for CetuGEX™, from first infusion until 28±2 days following the last infusion
Anti-Tumor Activity: Confirmed Best Overall Response Rates, Assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1. Tumors were measured by computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression, assessed up to 60 months|Anti-Tumor Activity: Clinical Benefit Rates, Assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1. Tumors were measured by computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression, assessed up to 60 months|Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status, The ECOG Scale of Performance Status describes a patient's level of functioning in terms of their ability to care for themself, daily activity, and physical ability (walking, working, etc.). The scale comprises six grades:

0 Fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease performance without restriction

1. Restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature, e.g., light house work, office work
2. Ambulatory and capable of all selfcare but unable to carry out any work activities; up and about more than 50% of waking hours
3. Capable of only limited selfcare; confined to bed or chair more than 50% of waking hours
4. Completely disabled; cannot carry on any selfcare; totally confined to bed or chair
5. Dead, From date of randomization until 28 days ± 2 days after the end of treatment|Pharmacokinetics (PK): Area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC), PK of CetuGEX™ after single and multiple administration, Prior to 1st infusion, end of 1st infusion, 4 hours after end, 72 and 168 hours after start of 1st infusion, then before and after each infusion up to 10 weeks|Pharmacokinetics (PK): Maximum serum concentration (Cmax), PK of CetuGEX™ after single and multiple administration, Prior to 1st infusion, end of 1st infusion, 4 hours after end, 72 and 168 hours after start of 1st infusion, then before and after each infusion up to 10 weeks|Pharmacokinetics (PK): Time to maximum serum concentration (tmax), PK of CetuGEX™ after single and multiple administration, Prior to 1st infusion, end of 1st infusion, 4 hours after end, 72 and 168 hours after start of 1st infusion, then before and after each infusion up to 10 weeks|Pharmacokinetics (PK): Minimal serum concentration (Cmin), PK of CetuGEX™ after single and multiple administration, Prior to 1st infusion, end of 1st infusion, 4 hours after end, 72 and 168 hours after start of 1st infusion, then before and after each infusion up to 10 weeks|Pharmacokinetics (PK): Terminal elimination half-life (t1/2), PK of CetuGEX™ after single and multiple administration, Prior to 1st infusion, end of 1st infusion, 4 hours after end, 72 and 168 hours after start of 1st infusion, then before and after each infusion up to 10 weeks|Pharmacokinetics (PK): Clearance rate (CL), PK of CetuGEX™ after single and multiple administration, Prior to 1st infusion, end of 1st infusion, 4 hours after end, 72 and 168 hours after start of 1st infusion, then before and after each infusion up to 10 weeks|Pharmacokinetics (PK): Volume of distribution (Vz), PK of CetuGEX™ after single and multiple administration, Prior to 1st infusion, end of 1st infusion, 4 hours after end, 72 and 168 hours after start of 1st infusion, then before and after each infusion up to 10 weeks
Male or female patients ≥18 years of age with a histologically confirmed locally advanced and/or metastatic solid organ tumor. Patients enrolled in Germany were required to have a positive EGFR overexpression status. Patients must have experienced a failure or non-availability of standard therapy (had received at least one line of chemotherapy and further standard therapy was not an option at study entry). Open-label, non-randomized, inter-patient dose-escalation, multi-center study. Patients were to receive CetuGEX until disease progression or until intolerable toxicities occurred.
