Hürthle Cell Carcinoma and Follicular Thyroid Carcinoma
The goal of this retrospective study is to evaluate in patients with HCC and FTC who underwent lobectomy. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* The necessity of completion thyroidectomy based on the clinicopathological characteristics
* Prognosis Participants underwent thyroid lobectomy Researchers compared HCC and FTC groups to see the prognosis after lobectomy.

TNM stage, a comparison of TNM stage between FTC and HCC groups, From January 2000 to March 2023
Background The prognosis of Hürthle cell carcinoma (HCC) and follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) is poorly understood. These types of cancers are usually confirmed after diagnostic lobectomy. We aimed to evaluate the clinicopathological characteristics and prognoses of patients with HCC and FTC who did not undergo completion thyroidectomy.

Materials and Methods We screened 221 patients diagnosed with FTC or HCC after thyroid lobectomy at Yonsei Severance Hospital between January 2000 and December 2020. After excluding patients who underwent complete thyroidectomy, 184 patients with FTC and 37 patients with HCC were included.
