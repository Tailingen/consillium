Treatment of Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of the combination of vorinostat, cisplatin, pemetrexed, and radiation therapy in patients with unresectable stage IIIA/IIIB non-small cell lung cancer.
Locally Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: vorinostat
To assess that safety and maximally tolerated dose of vorinostat in combination with chemoradiation for unresectable locally advanced NSCLC., toxicity assessments will occur weekly
To investigate progression free survival., CT/PET scans will be done after 12 weeks of therapy and at 12 week intervals until documented progression|To evaluate response rates with this combination, CT/PET will be done following 12 weeks of therapy.|To assess if pre-treatment tumor expression of TS, ERCC1 and HDAC1, 2, 3 are associated with response rate., Archival tissue will be tested and correlated to response rates.
This phase I trial will escalate doses of the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDAC) vorinostat to a chemoradiation platform for cisplatin, pemetrexed and radiation to a dose of 70Gy in NSCLC patients with unresectable IIIA and dry IIIB disease. The endpoint will be to determine MTD of the combination.
