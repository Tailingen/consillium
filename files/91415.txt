Evaluation of JSKN016 in the Treatment of Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cance： a Phase II Clinical Study
This is a Phase II clinical study conducted in China to evaluate the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer with JSKN016. The enrolled subjects are all in the locally advanced or metastatic stage of non-small cell lung cancer.The study is divided into two parts. The main objective of part I is to assess the efficacy and safety of JSKN016 in selected subjects with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. The main objective of part II is to compare the efficacy of JSKN016 and docetaxel in subjects with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.
Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: JSKN016|DRUG: Docetaxel
ORR assessed by the investigator per RECIST v1.1, Objective response rate (ORR) was defined as the proportion of participants who achieve either complete response \[CR\] or partial response \[PR\] per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1）, Up to 24months|Safety reflected by AE, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment., Up to 24months
DOR assessed by the investigator per RECIST v1.1, Duration of response (DoR) assessed according to RECIST v1.1., Up to 24months|DCR assessed by the investigator per RECIST v1.1, Disease control rate (DCR) assessed according to RECIST v1.1., Up to 24months|TTR assessed by the investigator per RECIST v1.1, Time to response (TTR) is defined as the time to response base on RECIST v1.1., Up to 24months|PFS assessed by investigator per RECIST v1.1, Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the date of initial administration till the first documentation of disease progression assessed by the investigator or death due to any cause (whichever occurs first)., Up to 24months|OS, Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from the date of initial administration till death due to any cause., Up to 24months|Cmax of JSKN016, Maximum (Peak) Observed blood Concentration (Cmax) of JSKN016 Following First Dose, Up to 24months|AUC of JSKN016, The blood PK parameters of JSKN016 and its analytes for area under the concentration-versus-time curve from time 0 to the last quantifiable concentration as calculated by the linear-up log-down trapezoidal method (AUClast) and AUC from time 0 to infinity (AUCinf) elimination rate constant associated with the terminal phase were estimated using standard non-compartmental methods., Up to 24months|Tmax of JSKN016, Time of Maximum blood Concentration (Tmax) of JSKN016 Following First Dose, Up to 24months|ADA, Number of subjects with detectable anti-drug antibodies (ADA)., Up to 24months
