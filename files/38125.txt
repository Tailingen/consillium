The purpose of this study is to compare the incidence rate of leukemia between CT-exposed and CT-unexposed group in patients who underwent appendectomy in South Korea.

Age and sex-standardized incidence rate ratio (IRR) for malignancies of hematologic system, Hematologic malignancies are categorized into lymphomas, multiple myeloma, leukemias, myelodysplasia and others using ICD-10 codes., Cancer occurrence after a lag period (2 years)
Age and sex-standardized incidence rate ratio (IRR) for malignancies of abdominal organs, age and sex-standardized IRRs for malignancies of abdominal organs for CT-exposed versus unexposed patients., Cancer occurrence after a lag period (2 years)|Age and sex-standardized incidence rate ratio (IRR) for all cancers, age and sex-standardized IRRs for all cancers for CT-exposed versus unexposed patients., Cancer occurrence after a lag period (2 years)
Sensitivity analysis, Various lag periods will be applied for the outcomes., Cancer occurrence after different lag periods (6 months, 1 year, 3 years and 5 years)|Subgroup analysis by subsequent CT scans conducted more than 7 days after appendectomy, IRR in patients who underwent CT after appendectomy IRR in patients who did not undergo CT after appendectomy, CT undergone more than 7 days after appendectomy will be counted.|Subgroup analysis, by age and sex, Cancer occurrence after a lag period (2 years)
South Korea has a single-payer healthcare system, administered by National Health Insurance Service (NHIS). As healthcare providers in South Korea need to claim reimbursement to NHIS for the vast majority of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, the NHIS database enabled us to construct a large cohort who did or did not undergo CT for appendicitis. The purpose of this study is to compare the incidence rate of cancer between CT-exposed and CT-unexposed group in patients who underwent appendectomy in South Korea.
