MTD, Safety and Efficacy of NYH817G and NYH100P in Monotherapy and Combination in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
The objectives of this study are:

Part 1:

* To assess the MTD, safety and efficacy of each NYH817G and NYH100P in monotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumors who have failed approved standard therapies.
* To assess the PK properties and the preliminary effectiveness of monotherapy of NYH817G and NYH100P.

Part 2:

* To assess the MTD, RP2D, safety and efficacy of NYH817G and NYH100P in combination therapy in patients with advanced solid tumors who have failed approved standard therapies
* To assess the PK properties, the preliminary effectiveness and the changes in metabolism of combination therapy of NYH817G and NYH100P.
