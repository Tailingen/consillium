A Study to Compare Tivozanib Hydrochloride to Sorafenib in Participants With Refractory Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)
This is a Phase 3, open-label, randomized, controlled, multi-national, multi-center, parallel-arm study comparing tivozanib to sorafenib in participants with refractory advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

Participants will be randomized (1:1) to treatment with tivozanib or sorafenib.

Participants will be stratified by International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC) risk category (favorable; intermediate; poor) and prior therapy (two prior vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (VEGFR TKI); a prior checkpoint inhibitor \[programmed cell death -1 protein (PD-1) or PD-1 ligand (PD1-L) inhibitor\] plus a prior VEGFR TKI; a prior VEGFR TKI plus any other systemic agent).

All participants will be evaluated for progression free survival, overall survival, objective response rate, and the duration of response as well as safety and tolerability.

Pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses are also included in study.
Carcinoma, Renal Cell
DRUG: Tivozanib hydrochloride|DRUG: Sorafenib
Progression-free Survival (PFS), The PFS, as assessed by a blinded independent radiological review (IRR), is defined as the time from randomization to first documentation of objective tumor progression (progressive disease) or death due to any reasons whichever comes first. Disease progression per RECIST 1.1 criteria is defined as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first. Disease progression was assessed every 8 weeks (up to approximately 5 years)
Overall Survival (OS), The OS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to date of death due to any cause., Date of randomization to date of death (up to approximately 5 years)|Objective Response Rate (ORR), The ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who have at least a 30% reduction in the sum of diameters per RECIST (Version 1.1)., Every 8 weeks from date of randomization until disease progression (up to approximately 5 years)|Duration of Response (DOR), The DOR is defined as the time from the first documentation of objective tumor response to the first documentation of tumor progression per RECIST 1.1 or to death due to any cause., Assessed every 8 weeks from date of randomization until date of progression (up to approximately 5 years)
