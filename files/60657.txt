Study To Determine The Maximum Range of Light Doses At Two HPPH Doses With Acceptable Normal Tissue Toxicity For PDT Treatment Of High Grade Dysplasia,CIS or Early Adenocarcinoma In Barrett's Esophagus
Patient's with High Grade Dysplasia, Carcinoma in situ or Early Adenocarcinoma in Barrett's Esophagus are injected with HPPH and one day later are endoscopically treated with light from a laser.
Barrett's Esophagus|CIS|HGD
DRUG: HPPH
Optimal Light Dose, Using toxicity to normal surrounding tissue as a determinant and using two HPPH doses of PDT in HGD, CIS or early adenocarcinoma in Barrett's esophagus, to determine the optimal light dose at each HPPH dose, 24 hours
Toxicity to normal surrounding tissue, To determine the tocixity to normal surrounding tissue of treating at approximately 24 hours(21-26hr) post injection of HPPH, 24 hours|Comparing HPPH to Photofrin, To determine the length of time of cutaneous photosensitivity of HPPH compared to historical data on Photofrin, 5 years|Effect of injection, To determine the effect of a 24 hours interval between injection of HPPH and light treatment, 24 hours|Efficacy of Treatment, A secondary objective is to determine efficacy of treatment at each set of paraments, i.e. ability to completely resolve the CIS, HGD or early cancer., 5 years|Resolve Barrett's mucosa, An Additional secondary objective is to determine ability of PDT to resolve the Barrett's mucosa, 5 years
Patient's with High Grade Dysplasia, Carcinoma in situ or Early Adenocarcinoma in Barrett's Esophagus are injected with HPPH and one day later are endoscopically treated with light from a laser.
