Laser treatment of Basal cell carcinoma
Basal Cell Carcinoma
DEVICE: 1064 nm long-pulse Nd:YAG laser|DEVICE: 1064 nm long-pulse Nd:YAG laser
Complete clearance of BCC, Histological confirmation of BCC clearance. Biopsy will be taken from the treatment site to confirm complete BCC clearance, 1 year
Cosmetic outcome, Cosmetic outcome and any adverse effects of the laser treatment will be assessed, 1 year
The purpose of this pilot study is to examine the treatment of superficial basal cell carcinoma (BCC) with laser technology. The laser modality that we plan to use is the long-pulse Nd:YAG 1064nm laser, which is a non-ablative laser already shown to effectively treat BCC.
