A Phase 1/2 Study To Evaluate ASN002 In Relapsed/Refractory Lymphoma And Advanced Solid Tumors
This study is a dose escalation, and cohort expansion study in subjects with advanced cancer for which no standard therapy exists. Subjects must have received prior treatment for cancer that has not worked, or has stopped working.

Objective Response Rate, Due to the early termination of the study, data for efficacy endpoints were insufficient for the planned efficacy analyses., First 29 days
The study will be conducted in two parts. Part A is a dose escalation study to determine a safe and tolerable dose of ASN002 for subjects with relapsed or refractory lymphoma, or advanced solid tumors. Part A will also characterize the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ASN002 through blood sampling. Subjects in Part B will enroll subjects with four types of lymphoma Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), Follicular Lymphoma (FL), Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) and Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL). Additional groups of subjects with Myelofibrosis (MF) and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) will be enrolled. Subjects will be treated with the highest safe and tolerable dose determined in Part A of the study to determine preliminary efficacy. Subjects may continue to receive ASN002 for up to 1 year in the absence of severe side effects or disease progression.
