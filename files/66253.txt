Quality of Life Scores, Quality of Life as assessed by the EuroQol 5 Dimension (EQ-5D) questionnaire. The index score ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating an overall better quality of life., 30, 60 and 90 days after randomization.
Development of Symptoms of Depression, Development of symptoms of depression as evaluated by the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) scale. Scores can range from 0 to 27, with higher scores increasing the probability of depression., 30, 60 and 90 days after randomization.|Adherence to medical appointments, Adherence to in-person medical appointments, as established by the attending physician of each participant. This outcome will be expressed as the proportion of visits attended by each patient., 90 days after randomization.
The primary objective of this study is to determine if utilizing a smartphone app for disease monitoring improves the self-reported quality of life using validated questionnaires in patients with diverse solid cancers compared to standard care. Secondary objectives focused on evaluating its impact on depressive symptoms and assessing adherence to in-person appointments. This study involves a randomized trial among patients recently diagnosed with specific forms of cancer and undergoing curative treatment at the UC Christus Cancer Center. The eligible participants, 80 adults with recent histologically confirmed cancer diagnoses, will be randomized to receive either the smartphone application (Contigo) or standard educational care. Randomization will be performed independently using an allocation sequence that will be kept concealed from clinical investigators. Contigo offers two primary functions: monitoring cancer patients and delivering educational content to aid patients in dealing with common clinical situations related to their disease. The study will assess outcomes such as quality of life changes, depressive symptom development, and adherence to in-person appointments. All analyses will be undertaken under the intention to treat principle by a statistician unaware of treatment allocation.
