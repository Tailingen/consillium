A Study of the Safety and Pharmacology of GDC-0980 in Combination With Either Paclitaxel and Carboplatin (With or Without Bevacizumab) or Pemetrexed and Cisplatin in Patients With Solid Tumors
This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase Ib dose-escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of GDC-0980 administered with either paclitaxel and carboplatin (with or without bevacizumab) or pemetrexed and cisplatin to patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
