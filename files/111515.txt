IPD in RRMM Characterized with Genomic Abnormalities of Adverse Prognostic
This study is a Multicenter, Open-label, Phase II study of ixazomib, plus Pomalidomide and Dexamethasone regimen (IPD) in RRMM with adverse Genomic Abnormalities.
Multiple Myeloma|Relapsed and Refractory Multiple Myeloma|Genetic Condition
DRUG: Ixazomib/Pomalidomide/Dexamethasone
Time to disease progression (TTP) to IPD in RRMM with adverse Genomic Abnormalities, Time to progression (TTP), defined as time from the first induction cycle to confirmed progressive disease (PD) per the International Myeloma Working Group criteria, or death due to progressive disease, whichever occurs first. It is noted that the events (PD or death due to PD) may include those that occur in the maintenance phase. The analysis will be performed on an Intent-To-Treat (ITT) basis and then per protocol, from Cycle 1 Day 1 of Induction phase (each Cycle is 21 days) until documented disease progression or death due to disease progression, whichever came first, assessed through study completion, an average of 18 months
Incidence of Serious Adverse Events and Adverse Events as assessed by CTCAE version 4.0, dose reduction or modification, A safety Analysis will be performed after the 10th patient enrolled has finished the first cycle of treatment, without any enrollment break. The Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will then analyzed the following:

* Frequency of Total Serious Adverse Events (SAE)
* Frequency of Adverse Events (AEs) Grade 3 or higher
* Frequency of dose reductions
* Frequency of dose discontinuations

Data Monitoring Committee. No enrollment break is planned unless requested by the IDMC. The IDMC will analyze:

There is no escalation dose study, the maximum tolerated dose has already been determined in previous phase 1 escalation dose studies. The proposed dose of dexamethasone is considered standard. Patients will receive the IPd regimen until progression.

The hypothesis is that this IPd regimen based combination will eventually improve time to disease progression, with no additional toxicity, as compared to other available regimens, in this subgroup of patients with myeloma characterized with a very adverse prognosis.

Study design. This trial will study the efficacy and safety of IPd regimen in Relapsed and Refractory Multiple Myeloma with adverse Genomic Abnormalities until progression in 2 separate phases.

* Induction phase: 17 cycles - 21-days cycles Ixazomib 3 mg D1, D4, D8 and D11 Pomalidomide 4mg D1 to D14 Dexamethasone 40 mg/d D1, D8 and D15 if patient aged \<75 years Dexamethasone 20 mg/d D1, D8 and D15 if patient aged â‰¥ 75 years
* Maintenance phase: until progression - 28-days cycles Ixazomib 4mg D1, D8 and D15 Pomalidomide 4mg D1 to D21
* It is not planned for the patients to receive autologous stem-cell transplantation as part of the study trial
