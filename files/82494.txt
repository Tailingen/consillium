A Safety Study of SEA-BCMA in Patients With Multiple Myeloma
This trial will study SEA-BCMA to find out whether it is an effective treatment for multiple myeloma (MM) and what side effects (unwanted effects) may occur.

The study will have several parts. In Parts A and B, participants get SEA-BCMA by itself. This part of the study will find out how much SEA-BCMA should be given for treatment and how often. It will also find out how safe the treatment is and how well it works.

In Part C of the study, participants will get SEA-BCMA and dexamethasone. In Part D, participants will get SEA-BCMA, dexamethasone, and pomalidomide. Dexamethasone and pomalidomide are both drugs that can be used to treat multiple myeloma. These parts of the study will find out whether these drugs are safe when used together.

Participants who have started a new antitumor treatment prior to documentation of PD were censored at the last disease assessment prior to start of new treatment. Participants lacking an evaluation of tumor response after their first dose had their event time censored as 1 day., From the date of first dose until the first documentation of PD or death or censoring date, whichever occurred first (maximum up to 34 months)|PFS: Part C, PFS: Time from the start of any study treatment to first documentation of DP or to death due to any cause, whichever comes first.

Participants lacking an evaluation of tumor response after their first dose had their event time censored as 1 day., From the date of first dose until the first documentation of PD or death or censoring date, whichever occurred first (maximum up to 20 months)|Overall Survival (OS): Part A, OS was defined as the time from the start of any study treatment to the date of death due to any cause. OS was calculated as date of death minus date of first dose of any study treatment plus 1. OS for participants who were alive at their date of last contact, including those lost to follow-up, were censored at the date of last contact. If the last recorded date where a participant was known to be alive is the date of first dose of any study treatment, survival time was censored on the date of first dose of any study treatment (i.e., OS duration of 1 day)., From date of start of study treatment until date of death or censoring date (maximum up to 45 months)|OS: Part B, OS was defined as the time from the start of any study treatment to the date of death due to any cause. OS was calculated as date of death minus date of first dose of any study treatment plus 1. OS for participants who were alive at their date of last contact, including those lost to follow-up, were censored at the date of last contact. If the last recorded date where a participant was known to be alive is the date of first dose of any study treatment, survival time was censored on the date of first dose of any study treatment (i.e., OS duration of 1 day)., From date of start of study treatment until date of death or censoring date (maximum up to 34 months)|OS: Part C, OS was defined as the time from the start of any study treatment to the date of death due to any cause.

This trial will study SEA-BCMA to find out whether it is an effective treatment for multiple myeloma (MM) and what side effects (unwanted effects) may occur.

The study will have several parts. In Parts A and B, participants get SEA-BCMA by itself. This part of the study will find out how much SEA-BCMA should be given for treatment and how often. It will also find out how safe the treatment is and how well it works.

In Part C of the study, participants will get SEA-BCMA and dexamethasone. In Part D, participants will get SEA-BCMA, dexamethasone, and pomalidomide. Dexamethasone and pomalidomide are both drugs that can be used to treat multiple myeloma. These parts of the study will find out whether these drugs are safe when used together.
