X-396 Capsule in Advanced NSCLC Patients With ROS1 Gene Rearrangement
To assess treatment effectiveness and safety of oral X-396 capsule (Ensartinib) administered to Chinese patients with Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) that is confirmed to be positive for a c-ROS Oncogene (ROS1) positive gene mutation (translocation or inversion).

This is a phase II, multicenter, single-arm study in which the efficacy and safety of X-396 capsule (Ensartinib) will be assessed in adult Chinese patients with ROS1-positive (rearrangement or inversion) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Approximately 69 patients (59 for never-treated, and 10 for previously treated with crizotinib) with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC carrying ROS1-rearrangement will be enrolled in the study.
