Node-sparing Short-Course Radiation Combined With CAPOX and Tislelizumab for MSS Rectal Cancer
This is a randomized, prospective, multicenter, open-label, Phase III clinical trial to evaluate node-sparing modified short-course radiation (Radiation targeting the tumor bed without irradiating surrounding tumor-draining lymph nodes) combined with CAPOX and PD-1 Inhibitor (Tislelizumab) compared with standard short-course radiation combined with CAPOX for patients with MSS middle and low rectal cancer. A total of 170 patients will be enrolled in this trial. The primary endpoint is the rate of pathological complete response (pCR). The EFS rate, ORR, organ preservation rate, long-term prognosis, and adverse effects will also be analyzed.
