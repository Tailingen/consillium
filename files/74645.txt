Perioperative Immunonutrition Under Enhanced Recovery After Surgery
The goal of this clinical trial is to compare the effect of perioperative immunonutrition supplement in gynecologic cancer patients. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* is there any difference in the nutritional outcomes and functional outcomes between intervention and conventional groups?
* is there any difference in the post-surgical outcomes between intervention and conventional groups?
