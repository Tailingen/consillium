Reducing Cognitive Impairment in Glioma with Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation and Cognitive Strategy Training
The TRUE-GRIT study will assess the feasibility of a study protocol investigating the efficacy of a combination therapy consisting of cognitive strategy training (CST) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to reduce cognitive impairment in adult glioma patients. This study is part of the GRIP-project, a project aimed at investigating interventions for improving quality of life in brain tumor patients.
Cognitive Impairment|Glioma
DEVICE: real repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)|DEVICE: sham repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)|BEHAVIORAL: cognitive strategy training
Number of patients completing intervention and study protocol, The feasibility will be assessed by number of patients completing the intervention and obligatory study measurements, Baseline versus directly post-intervention (max. 11 weeks after baseline)
Tolerability and side effects of the combination therapy, Tolerability and side-effects will be assessed with an in-house-made questionnaire (with yes/no and open questions), Weekly during the intervention (7 weeks)
Exploratory outcomes: neurocognitive functioning, pre- and post-treatment brain activity, connectivity and network topology., Exploratory parameters are measured as they will be of relevance for a subsequent RCT in case of proven feasibility. Measurements: MRI, MEG, neuropsychological assessment and questionnaires., Baseline versus directly post-intervention (max. 11 weeks after baseline)
