A Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of MORAb-202 (Herein Referred to as Farletuzumab Ecteribulin), a Folate Receptor Alpha (FRα)-Targeting Antibody-drug Conjugate (ADC) in Participants With Selected Tumor Types
The primary objectives of the study are: (1) in the dose-escalation part: to evaluate safety and tolerability and to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of farletuzumab ecteribulin (MORAb-202) in participants with selected tumor types (ovarian cancer \[OC\], endometrial cancer \[EC\], non-small cell lung carcinoma \[NSCLC\], triple-negative breast cancer \[TNBC\]), and (2) in dose-confirmation part: to evaluate preliminary efficacy measured by objective response rate (ORR) of farletuzumab ecteribulin (MORAb-202) in participants with OC and EC at selected doses and to further evaluate the safety and tolerability of farletuzumab ecteribulin (MORAb-202) and (3) dose-optimization part. (divided in two parts: Part A \[OC and EC participants\] and Part B \[EC only\]): Part A: to evaluate other farletuzumab ecteribulin (MORAb-202) treatment regimens for safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy in participants with OC and EC; to evaluate the use of the addition of short course of oral corticosteroids following every dose of farletuzumab ecteribulin (MORAb-202) administered every 21 days, as mitigation strategy for interstitial lung disease (ILD); and to select treatment regimens with farletuzumab ecteribulin (MORAb-202) for further evaluation in Part B. Part B: to further evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of 2 treatment regimens with farletuzumab ecteribulin (MORAb-202) in participants with advanced EC and to determine the recommended treatment regimen for further development of farletuzumab ecteribulin (MORAb-202).

Toxicity will be evaluated according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (NCI CTCAE 5.0)., Cycle 1 (Cycle length=21 days)|Number of Participants With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Adverse Events (AEs) Leading to Treatment Discontinuation and Adverse Events of Interest (AEIs), AE: as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered with an investigational product. SAE: as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose; resulted in death, was life-threatening, required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or resulted incongenital anomaly/birth defect. AEIs are AEs that may be associated with the use of immunomodulatory drugs, such as infections, malignancies, autoimmune disorders, and injection reactions. Number of participants with AEIs were reported based on safety assessment of participants with interstitial lung disease (ILD), severity of ILD, time to resolution and onset of ILD symptoms and deaths due to ILD., Baseline up to 28 days after the last dose of study drug (up to approximately 4 years 8 months)
Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the first date of documented CR or PR to the date of disease progression or death, whichever occurs first. It will be calculated for participants whose BOR is CR or PR. DOR will be assessed according to RECIST version 1.1., From first documented CR or PR until first documentation of recurrent or progressive disease or death (up to approximately 4 years 8 months)|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of participants with BOR of CR, PR, or stable disease (SD). DCR will be assessed according to RECIST version 1.1., From first dose of study drug until first documentation of CR or PR or SD (up to approximately 4 years 8 months)|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), CBR is defined as the percentage of participants with BOR of CR, PR, or durable SD (duration of SD greater than or equal to \[\>=\] 5 weeks). Duration of SD is defined as the time from the date of first dose to the date of the first documentation of disease progression or death, whichever occurs first. It will be calculated for participants whose BOR is SD. CBR will be assessed according to RECIST version 1.1., From first dose of study drug until disease progression or death, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 4 years 8 months)|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of first dose to the date of the first documentation of disease progression or death, whichever occurs first. PFS will be assessed according to RECIST version 1.1., From first dose of study drug until disease progression, death, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 4 years 8 months)|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of first dose to the date of death. For the participants who are alive or lost to follow up, OS is censored as the date of last known alive date or the date of data cutoff, whichever comes first. OS will be calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method., From first dose of study drug until death (up to approximately 4 years 8 months)|Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Change From Baseline in Clinical Laboratory Values, Vital Signs, Body Weight and 12-lead Electrocardiograms, Baseline up to 28 days after the last dose of study drug (up to approximately 4 years 8 months)|Change From Baseline in Oxygen Saturation (SpO2), Change from baseline in percent of SpO2 (measured by pulse oximetry) will be calculated by measuring oxygen saturation at rest and immediately after exercise., Baseline up to 28 days after the last dose of study drug (up to approximately 4 years 8 months)|Change From Baseline in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS), ECOG PS is used by doctors and researchers to assess how a participant's disease is progressing, assess how the disease affects the daily living activities of the participant and determine appropriate treatment and prognosis.
