The hypothesis of this study are as follows:

* Prognostic evaluation of patients based on an integrative model provides better assessment of overall survival, and thus improves setting of care goals.
* In a routine care population, antitumour drugs may have a significant impact on overall survival through their targeted antitumor effect, but also through their toxicity profile and their impact on comorbidities.
* The optimization of patient support (supportive care, drug tolerance monitoring) can have an impact on the prognosis.
