Impact of Biliopancreatic Limb Length on Diabetes Following Distal Gastrectomy
This is a prospective, randomized controlled trial to investigate the impact of a long biliopancreatic limb of Roux-en-Y reconstruction on diabetes control in patients with concurrent type 2 diabetes and gastric cancer

The present study aimed to compare the changes in glucose metabolism and incretin hormone responses following long-limb bypass Roux-en-Y reconstruction with different biliopancreatic limb lengths after distal gastrectomy in gastric cancer patients with type 2 diabetes. This is a prospective, single-center, randomized controlled trial. Patients diagnosed with stage I gastric cancer and type 2 diabetes are eligible for the present study. Patients who will undergo laparoscopic distal gastrectomy for cancer located at the lower two-thirds of the stomach will only be included.

The reconstruction method will be randomly assigned among long-Roux limb Roux-en-Y (with 100 cm-long Roux limb \& 50cm-long biliopancreatic limb) or long-biliopancreatic limb Roux-en-Y (with 50 cm-long Roux limb \& 100cm-long biliopancreatic limb) reconstruction methods.

All the patients are subjected to a 75g-oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) preoperatively, and at 3 months, 6 months postoperatively, and serum glucose, as well as incretin hormones, will be serially measured. Fecal samples will be obtained preoperatively and at 3 months after surgery for gut microbiota analyses.
