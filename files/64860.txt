A Study of Avastin (Bevacizumab) in Combination With Standard Therapy in Patients With Metastatic Renal Cell Cancer.
This single arm study will assess the efficacy and safety of Avastin in combination with interferon alfa-2a and vinblastine as first line treatment in patients with metastatic renal cell cancer. Patients will receive Avastin (15mg/kg iv) every 3 weeks, interferon alfa-2a 3 times weekly (3 Mio IU sc escalating to 18 Mio sc) and vinblastine (0.1mg/kg iv) every 3 weeks. The anticipated time on study treatment is until tumor progression, and the target sample size is 100-500 individuals.
Renal Cell Cancer
DRUG: bevacizumab [Avastin]|DRUG: Interferon alfa-2a|DRUG: Vinblastine
Percentage of Participants With Disease Progression or Death, Disease progression was evaluated according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) using computed tomography (CT) scans (preferred method), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, X-ray, bone scans, or clinical examination., Days 0, 91, 182, 273, 365, 456, and 547|PFS - Time to Event, PFS was defined as the time in days from the date of treatment start to the date of first documented disease progression or death. Disease progression was evaluated according to RECIST using CT scans (preferred method), MRI scans, X-ray, bone scans, or clinical examination. Median PFS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, Days 0, 91, 182, 273, 365, 456, and 547
Percentage of Participants With Objective Response (OR), Percentage of participants with OR based on assessment of confirmed complete remission (CR) or confirmed partial remission (PR) according to RECIST., Baseline and Cycles 3, 6, 9, 13, and 17|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the duration from treatment start to death from any cause. Overall survival was censored at the last contact for surviving participants and missing data points., Baseline, Day 1 of every cycle to disease progression or death (up to Week 102)
