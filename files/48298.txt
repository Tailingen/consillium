ARIADNE will collect and analyze data of adult patients with WM, CLL, MZL or FL in need of treatment. The study will explore the medical resource utilization during therapy with zanubrutinib (Brukinsa®). Further aims are to assess effectiveness, safety and tolerability of the treatment as well as treatment satisfaction and biomarkers. These data will be supplemented by the assessment of patient-reported outcomes (PROs)/ health-related quality of life (QoL).

Since treatment options for MW, CLL, MZL or FL are limited and the most important factor is to keep or improve QoL of the patients, there is an urge for real-world clinical data of patients treated with zanubrutinib, especially focusing on patients already treated upfront with a BTK inhibitor, older patients and patients with comorbidities.
