CAR-Multicenter Analysis (CAR-MA): Retrospective Study to Characterize CAR T-cell Outcomes and Related Toxicities in Children and Young Adults With B-ALL
Study Description:

This retrospective protocol focuses on characterizing clinical outcomes and toxicities following CAR T-cell therapy.

Objectives:

Primary

To evaluate the Response Free Survival (RFS) at 6 months following CD19 CAR stratified by prior blinatumomab vs no prior blinatumomab

To retrospectively evaluate outcomes following CAR T-cell therapy across children and young adults with B-ALL

Secondary

To evaluate the RFS at 12 months following CD19 CAR stratified by prior blinatumomab vs no prior blinatumomab and other immunotherapy.

To evaluate the incidence of CD19 negative versus CD19 positive relapse following CD19 CAR stratified by prior blinatumomab vs no prior blinatumomab.

To evaluate the Complete Response (CR) rate following CD19 CAR stratified by prior blinatumomab vs no prior blinatumomab.

To evaluate the Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) negative remission rate following CD19 CAR stratified by prior blinatumomab vs no prior blinatumomab.

Study Population and Source of Data: Subjects who were less than \< 25 years of age at the time of diagnosis and received a CAR T-cell product for B-ALL.
