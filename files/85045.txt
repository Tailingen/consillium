Camrelizumab Combined With Famitinib Malate for Treatment of Recurrent/Metastatic Cervical Cancer
This study is a randomized, open-label, controlled, multi-center Phase III clinical study, aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of camrelizumab combined with famitinib malate versus platinum-based chemotherapy in the treatment of recurrent/metastatic cervical cancer. All enrolled patients will be randomly divided into 2 groups and continuously treated until any event that meets the criteria for end of the clinical trial.
