The Phoenix Trial: Phase II Trial of Cemiplimab for the Non-operative Management of Localized dMMR Colon Cancer
To learn if cemiplimab can help to control dMMR colon cancer.
Colon Cancer
DRUG: Cemiplimab
Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, Through study completion; an average of 1 year
Primary Objective:

â€¢To assess feasibility and success of an organ-sparing strategy in patients with localized dMMR colorectal cancer receiving neoadjuvant cemiplimab. The primary endpoint is rate of endoCR by 6 months.

Exploratory Objectives:

* To quantify organ-sparing rate at 1 year for all patients treated with one dose of cemiplimab (intent to treat)
* To quantify the composite rate of either non-operative management at 1 year or pathological complete response for all patients treated with one dose of cemiplimab (intent to treat)
* To quantify the composite rate of either endoCR by 6 months or pathologic complete response for all patients treated with one dose of cemiplimab (intent to treat)
* To assess and describe features observed on endoscopy after neoadjuvant cemiplimab
* To assess radiographic response to neoadjuvant cemiplimab
* To estimate the relapse-free survival, progression-free survival and overall survival in all enrolled participants
* To determine the overall rates of pathological response to neoadjuvant cemiplimab in patients who undergo resection after receiving at least one dose of cemiplimab
* To determine overall safety of cemiplimab for patients with localized colon cancer
* To determine the change in patient-reported symptoms with cemiplimab
* To explore the predictive ability of changes in ctDNA for efficacy endpoints
* To determine if total mutational burden and genomic alterations correlate with response and extent of benefit from cemiplimab
* To correlate tumor-immune microenvironment (for example T-effector cell populations; CD4 subsets; T-regulatory populations; B cell populations; dendritic and macrophage populations) in pre-treatment tumor samples with efficacy endpoints
* To compare targeted gene expression profiles of immune-related genes and genes pertaining to common cancer signaling pathways in pre-treatment samples as well as the change in these factors (for cases with both pre-treatment and on-treatment tumor samples) between responders and non-responders
