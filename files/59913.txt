Study of the Combination of Anti-OX40 and Ipilimumab in Patients With Metastatic Melanoma
This is an open label, two-phase study combining a dose escalation Phase 1 with a proof-of-concept Phase 2 in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, for whom treatment with ipilimumab is indicated.

The purpose of the Phase 1 is to determine the Anti-OX40 Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and the secondary objectives are anti-OX40 pharmacokinetics, biological activity and the tumor response assessed by the Immune-related Response Criteria.

The purpose of Phase 2 is to determine tumor response (by irRC) and the secondary objectives are anti-OX40 pharmacokinetics, biological activity and Safety/Tolerability.
Metastatic Melanoma
DRUG: Anti-OX40|DRUG: Ipilimumab
Assess safety and tolerability according to the National Cancer Institute CTCAE v4.0 (Phase 1 and 2), Laboratory tests, vital sign measurements, physical exams and patient interviews will be performed to detect new abnormalities and deteriorations of any pre-existing conditions, Up to 16 weeks|Assess Tumor Response by the Immune-related Response Criteria (Phase 2), Tumor Response by irRC is defined as irPR or irCR over a period of at least 4 weeks, Baseline, Week 12 & week 16
Determine Anti-OX40 serum concentrations, The serum concentration of Anti-OX40 (CD134) will be determined from its binding to OX40 as measured by ELISA, Baseline, on days 1, 3 & 5 30 minutes after Anti-OX40 end of infusion, and on days 8 and 15|Assess the biological activity of anti-OX40 in combination with ipilimumab, The biological activity of anti-OX40 in combination with ipilimumab will be assessed by:

* Determining immunologic changes in the tumor microenvironment by characterization of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), assessment of antigen-specific T cell responses and immunohistochemical (IHC) characterization of tumor and peri-tumoral tissue
* Characterizing circulating T-cell subsets by flow cytometry
* Assessing antigen specific immune responses by ELISA
* Characterizing surface markers on lymphocytes and peripheral blood cells by flow cytometry
* Measuring serum level of soluble factors (cytokine profiling)
* mRNA/miRNA profiling to analyse gene transcription and/or miRNA expression, Baseline, Day1, day 3, day 5 day8, day 15, day 22 day 43, day 64, day 85 & 113
