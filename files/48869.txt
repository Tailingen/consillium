A Prospective, Phase II Trial Using ctDNA to Initiate Post-operation Boost Therapy After NAC in TNBC
Positive circulating tumor DNA(ctDNA) status is associated with worse prognosis in breast cancer, especially triple-negative breast cancer(TNBC). Our trial aims to improve the outcome of TNBC patients by using ctDNA to identify patients with high relapse risk. ctDNA positive patients will be randomized to receive boost therapy or standard therapy indicated in NCCN guidelines after NAC.
Triple-negative Breast Cancer
