Treatment of Recurrent or Progressive Meningiomas With the Radiolabelled Somatostatin Antagonist 177Lu-satoreotide
Meningiomas are known to be the most frequent intracranial neoplasms and account for approx. 25-33% of all intracranial tumours.Targeted radionuclide therapy with radiolabelled somatostatin analogues, also called Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT), has proven to be an effective treatment in metastatic intestinal neuroendocrine tumours and is currently used in advanced, recurrent or progressive meningiomas with promising results. In this study, the therapeutic index of a standard and newly developed radiolabelled somatostatin antagonist will be evaluated and compared in PRRT. In a second step, safety and efficacy of the latter will be assessed.

In order to get kinetic information of 177Lu- DOTA-JR11 and 177Lu-DOTATOC for this task total body scintigraphy and SPECT/CT of head and abdomen (phase 0 study) or only head (phase I/II study) are performed at different time points post injection 177Lu-DOTA-JR11 or 177Lu-DOTATOC., 24, 48 and 168 hours (+/- 30 min up to 24 hours)|Assessment of treatment safety (phase I/II) by number of AEs graded according to CTCAE v5.0, In Phase I/II the primary objective is to assess the safety considerations of patients treated with 177Lu-DOTA-JR11 after 3 - 5 cycles of 177Lu-DOTA-JR11 PRRT: AEs graded according to CTCAE v5.0, About 1 hour before infusion up to 41 - 45 days after infusion

Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability., From Screening up to 12 months after 3rd infusion|Change in visual parameters (Phase 0 and Phase I/II), For optical nerve sheath meningiomas: Assessment of visual acuity (visual field) before and after start with PRRT., up to 60-70 weeks|Change in Plasma Concentration [Cmax] of 177Lu-DOTA-JR11 in the human body (Phase I/II), Assessment of pharmacokinetics of 177Lu-DOTA-JR11 in the human body., up to 50 weeks|Whole body and organ radiation doses (Phase I/II), Assessment of whole body and organ radiation doses of 177Lu-DOTA-JR11 (first cycle only), up to 60-70 weeks

The somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (sstr2) has been identifies as a peptide hormone receptor that is highly expressed in 70 - 100% of meningiomas representing an attractive target for so called "theranostic" applications combining molecular imaging and targeted radionuclide therapy with radiolabelled somatostatin analogues.The newly developed radiolabelled somatostatin antagonist 177Lu-DOTA-JR11 has been shown to exert a high binding affinity to sstr2 suggesting a higher efficacy in the treatment of advanced meningiomas than the currently available somatostatin analogues (e.g. 177Lu-DOTATOC, 177Lu-DOTATATE).Therefore, the hypothesis has been postulated that 177LuDOTA-JR11 has an improved therapeutic index (tumour-to-dose limiting organ dose ratios) compared to 177Lu-DOTATOC, and that it can be safely used for PRRT in patients with advanced, recurrent or progressive meningiomas. The aim of this 2-step Phase 0 / Phase I/II study is to a) evaluate in the same meningioma patients the therapeutic index (tumour-to-dose limiting organ dose ratios) of 177Lu-DOTA-JR11 in comparison to 177Lu-DOTATOC and b) based on the previous results, to evaluate safety and preliminary efficacy of PRRT with 177Lu-DOTA-JR11.
