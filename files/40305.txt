Standardization of Laparoscopic Surgery for Right Hemi Colon Cancer (SLRC)
To standardize the surgery for advanced right hemi colon cancer with laparoscopy and investigate whether extended lymphadenectomy (CME) could improve disease-free survival in patients with right colon cancer, compared with D3 radical operation in laparoscopic colectomy.

Disease-free survival, 3 years
The rate of postoperative complications and mortality, 30 days|3 years overall survival, 3 years|The rate of local and distant recurrence, 3 years|The accuracy of preoperative staging with CT, 14 days
