Post-transplant Cyclophosphamide and Sirolimus Following Reduced Intensity Conditioning (RIC) Transplant
This trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of post-transplant Cy and sirolimus following reduced intensity allogeneic SCT. It is hoped that the combination of a reduced intensity preparative regimen with a calcineurin-free GVHD prophylaxis regimen will decrease the risk of acute and chronic GVHD, by both limiting mucosal toxicity and augmenting immune reconstitution, thereby improving the safety of the procedure. The past experience with post-transplant Cy suggests that SCT recipients will attain rapid donor T cell chimerism, which the investigators hope will translate into improved disease control through the well documented graft-versus-malignancy effects of donor T cells.
Hematologic Neoplasms
PROCEDURE: Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation
Incidence of GVHD, To estimate the incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) when utilizing post-transplant cyclophosphamide (Cy) and sirolimus for GVHD prophylaxis following reduced intensity allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) in patients with high risk hematologic malignancies., 1 year
Incidence of Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC)/Platelet Engraftment, To estimate the incidence of neutrophil and platelet engraftment, Approximately Day 30|Number of Participants With Non-Relapse Mortality, 1 year|Number of Patients With Disease Free Survival at 2 Years, 2 years|Number of Patients to Achieve Full Donor Chimerism, Characterize rate of achievement of full donor chimerism, 1 year|Number of Patients With Overall Survival at 2 Years., 2 years
