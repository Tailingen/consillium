A Study to Investigate the Biological Effects of AZD9833 in Women With ER-positive, HER2 Negative Primary Breast Cancer
This is a randomised, open-label, parallel-group, pre-surgical study aimed to investigate the biological effects, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of different doses of oral AZD9833 in post-menopausal women with primary breast cancer
HER2-negative Breast Cancer
DRUG: AZD9833
Percentage Change From Baseline in Estrogen Receptor (ER) Expression Between Pre- and On-treatment Tumour Samples (Primary Analysis), The pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of AZD9833 on ER expression comparing pre- and on-treatment tumour samples in women with early breast cancer after 5 to 7 days and 12 to 15 days of AZD9833 treatment was assessed. The assessment was done by immunohistochemistry (IHC) method. The percentage change was calculated from an analysis of covariance (ANCVOA) model adjusting for baseline ER score and day of on-treatment biopsy., Baseline (Screening Day -21 to 1) to Biopsy day (Days 5-7 [Stage 1 and 2] or Days 12-15 [Stage 3])|Percentage Change From Baseline in ER Expression Between Pre- and On-treatment Tumour Samples (Sensitivity Analysis), The PD effect of AZD9833 on ER expression comparing pre- and on-treatment tumour samples in women with early breast cancer after 5 to 7 days and 12 to 15 days of AZD9833 treatment was assessed. The assessment was done by IHC method. The sensitivity analysis excluded any patients who were HER2-positive patient by central assessment as well as patients with baseline ER H-score \< 10. The percentage change was calculated from ANCVOA model adjusting for baseline ER score and day of on-treatment biopsy., Baseline (Screening Day -21 to 1) to Biopsy Day (Days 5-7 [Stage 1 and 2] or Days 12-15 [Stage 3])
Percentage Change From Baseline in Progesterone Receptor (PgR) Expression Between Pre- and On-treatment Tumour Samples (Primary Analysis), The PD effects of AZD9833 on PgR expression comparing pre- and on-treatment tumour samples in women with early breast cancer after 5 to 7 days and 12 to 15 days of AZD9833 treatment was assessed. The assessment was done by IHC method. The percentage change was calculated from an ANCOVA model adjusting for baseline PgR score and day of on-treatment biopsy., Baseline (Screening Day -21 to 1) to Biopsy Day (Days 5-7 [Stage 1 and 2] or Days 12-15 [Stage 3])|Percentage Change From Baseline in PgR Expression Between Pre- and On-treatment Tumour Samples (Sensitivity Analysis), The PD effects of AZD9833 on PgR expression comparing pre- and on-treatment tumour samples in women with early breast cancer after 5 to 7 days and 12 to 15 days of AZD9833 treatment was assessed. The assessment was done by IHC method. The sensitivity analysis excluded any patients who were HER2-positive patient by central assessment as well as patients with baseline PgR H-score \< 10. The percentage change was calculated from an ANCOVA model adjusting for baseline PgR score and day of on-treatment biopsy., Baseline (Screening Day -21 to 1) to Biopsy day (Days 5-7 [Stage 1 and 2] or Days 12-15 [Stage 3])|Percentage Change From Baseline in Ki-67 Labelling Index Between Pre- and On-treatment Tumour Samples (Primary Analysis), The PD effect of AZD9833 on antigen Ki-67 expression comparing pre- and on-treatment tumour samples in women with early breast cancer after 5 to 7 days and 12 to 15 days of AZD9833 treatment was assessed. The assessment was done by IHC method. The percentage change was calculated from an ANCOVA model adjusting for log baseline Ki67 index and day of on-treatment biopsy. The Ki-67 index data were log transformed prior to analysis, with results back-transformed to represent percentage change., Baseline (Screening Day -21 to 1) to Biopsy day (Days 5-7 [Stage 1 and 2] or Days 12-15 [Stage 3])|Percentage Change From Baseline in Ki-67 Labelling Index Between Pre- and On-treatment Tumour Samples (Sensitivity Analysis), The PD effect of AZD9833 on antigen Ki-67 expression comparing pre- and on-treatment tumour samples in women with early breast cancer after 5 to 7 days and 12 to 15 days of AZD9833 treatment was assessed. The assessment was done by IHC method. The sensitivity analysis excluded any patients who were HER2-positive patient by central assessment as well as patients with baseline Ki67 labelling index \<5%. The percentage change was calculated from an ANCOVA model adjusting for log baseline Ki67 index and day of on-treatment biopsy. The Ki-67 index data were log transformed prior to analysis, with results back-transformed to represent percentage change., Baseline (Screening Day -21 to 1) to Biopsy Day (Days 5-7 [Stage 1 and 2] or Days 12-15 [Stage 3])|Number of Patients With Adverse Events (AEs), The safety and tolerability of AZD9833 in this patient population was evaluated., From screening (Day -21 to 1) through 28-day follow-up (Upto 2 months)|Plasma Concentrations of AZD9833, The plasma concentration of AZD9833 in this participant population was evaluated, Days 5-7 or Days 12-15 (Pre and Post biopsy)
The study will be conducted in approximately 20 study centers across 3 countries and will be conducted in three stages (stage 1, stage 2 and stage 3). After the screening visit and confirmation of eligibility, evaluable participants will be enrolled across treatment groups. In stage 1, up to 24 evaluable participants across two treatment groups will be enrolled. A Safety and Data Monitoring Committee will convene to review stage 1 data and decide whether further treatment groups are required in stage 2. Stage 2 will include participants across up to 3 treatment groups. Stage 3 will include two treatment groups:

Stage 1 Group 1: AZD9833 Dose A once daily Group 2: AZD9833 Dose B once daily

Stage 2 Group 1: AZD9833 Dose A once daily Group 2: AZD9833 Dose B once daily Group 3: AZD9833 Dose C once daily

Stage 3 Group 1: AZD9833 Dose A once daily Group 2: AZD9833 Dose B once daily

Adverse events and concomitant medications information will be collected throughout the study. Thereafter there will be 28-day follow-up visit after discontinuation of study treatment
