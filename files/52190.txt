Atezolizumab Versus Placebo for the Adjuvant Treatment of Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (Atezomeso)
This is a multicentric double-blind, placebo controlled, phase III trial. In this study, patients who underwent to a surgical resection of pleural mesothelioma and are without signs of macroscopic residual disease will be randomized 2:1 to receive atezolizumab or placebo. Patients will be treated for 12 months or until recurrence, unacceptable toxicity or patient/physician decision, whichever occurs first.

Randomization will be done via a centralized system and patients will be stratified histology (epithelioid vs non epithelioid) and stage (I vs

\>I). Patients will be radiologically evaluated after surgical procedure before starting therapy and then every 12 weeks for 24 months or until disease progression. At screening patients should be without macroscopic residual disease. Quality of life questionnaire will be administered to patient at baseline and every 12 weeks. During the study baseline tumor blocks will be centrally analyzed to determinate biological characteristics and gene expression.
