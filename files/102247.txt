Pinpointing the Factors Affecting Clinical Trial Experiences of Glioblastoma Patients
Historically, clinical study participation has been biased toward certain demographics. However, there is a shortage of studies that delve into the underlying factors that influence patient participation, both positively and negatively.

Several people will be invited to enroll in this study so that it may collect a variety of data about glioblastoma clinical trial experiences and identify barriers to participation as well as the causes of participants' failure or withdrawal.

The data collected from this study will be analyzed and used to improve the experiences of future glioblastoma patients who are recruited for medical trials.
