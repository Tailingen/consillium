Phase I Study of pCAR-19B in the Treatment of Adult CD19-positive Relapsed/Refractory B-ALL
This is a phase I clinical study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of pCAR-19B in adults with relapsed or refractory B-ALL, and to obtain the maximum tolerated dose of pCAR-19B and phase II Recommended dose.
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, in Relapse|Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: pCAR-19B cells
Incidence of Adverse events after pCAR-19B infusion [Safety and Tolerability], Therapy-related adverse events were recorded and assessed according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, Version 5.0), 28 days|Obtain the maximum tolerated dose of pCAR-19B cells[Safety and Tolerability], Dose-limiting toxicity after cell infusion, 28 days
Objective response rate after pCAR-19B infusion [Effectiveness], Objective response rate includes CR, CRi, 3 months|AUCS of pCAR-19B cells [Cell dynamics], AUCS is defined as the area under the curve in 28 days and 90 days, 3 months|CMAX of pCAR-19B cells [Cell dynamics], CMAX is defined as the highest concentration of pCAR-19B cells expanded in peripheral blood, 3 months|TMAX of pCAR-19B cells [Cell dynamics], TMAX is defined as the time to reach the highest concentration, 3 months|Pharmacodynamics of pCAR-19B cells[Cell dynamics], Cytokines such as hs-CRP, IL-6 levels, 3 months|Immunogenicity of pCAR-19B cells, Anti-CAR antibody, 3 months
This is a single-center, single-arm, open-label study. The study plans to set up 3 dose groups, adopting a dose-escalating 3+3 design, and plan to recruit about 9-18 adults with relapsed or refractory B-ALL.pCAR-19B will be infused to the subject by intravenous infusion.
