Comparing Warm Versus Cool Temperature Water During Colonoscopy
The purpose of this study will be to determine if the temperature of water used during insertion of colonoscopy makes a difference in patient discomfort and sedation requirements. The hypothesis of this study is patients receiving screening colonoscopy utilizing the water insertion method with room temperature (cool) water will have similar pain scores and medication requirements compared to water insertion method using body temperature (warm) water.

PROCEDURE: Warm vs Cool water
Dose of sedation medication used (fentanyl and midazolam), Duration of the colonoscopy; Up to 3 hours
