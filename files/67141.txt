Observational Study for the Evaluation of Long-term Safety of Radium-223 Used for the Treatment of Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer
Observational study in the routine clinical practice setting to evaluate the short and long term safety profile of Radium-223 in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer patients and to evaluate the risk of developing second primary cancers.
