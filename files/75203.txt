Classifying for HER2 Dependence to De-Escalate Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Patients With HER2+ Early Breast Cancer Undergoing HER2 Double-Blockade
This study aims to identify HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer patients who could benefit from neoadjuvant treatment using PHESGO™ (pertuzumab and trastuzumab) without chemotherapy. The approach involves utilizing specific biomarkers (HR and HER2 IHC status) to select participants whose tumors strongly rely on the HER2 pathway, potentially benefiting from a HER2-targeted approach without chemotherapy concurrently.
Breast Cancer|HER2-positive Breast Cancer
DRUG: PHESGO
Pathologic Complete Response (pCR) Rate, This outcome measures the rate of participants with HER2-positive early breast cancer who achieve a pathologic complete response (pCR) following neoadjuvant treatment with PHESGO™ without concurrent chemotherapy. Participants selected based on high HER2 pathway dependence and demonstrating a favorable PET-CT response after the third therapy cycle are evaluated for the absence of residual invasive tumor cells in the breast and lymph nodes., After eight neoadjuvant cycles of PHESGO™ (each cycle is 21 days)
Rate of Favorable PET-CT Response, Measures the percentage of participants showing a ≥40% reduction in SUVMax on PET-CT after three cycles of neoadjuvant PHESGO™. Responders demonstrate significant SUVmax reduction with no metabolic progression in non-target lesions., After three neoadjuvant PHESGO™ cycles (each cycle is 21 days)|Pathologic Response via Residual Cancer Burden (RCB), Evaluates pathologic response using the Residual Cancer Burden (RCB) tool, available at the provided link. RCB is assessed to determine the extent of residual cancer after treatment, aiding in treatment response evaluation., Immediately after the end of treatment|Objective Response Rate by PERCIST 1.0, Measures the percentage of participants achieving complete metabolic response (CMR) or partial metabolic response (PMR) as per PERCIST 1.0 criteria, assessed by site radiology review after three cycles of neoadjuvant PHESGO™. Metabolic response assessment follows the Radiology Assessment section guidelines., After three neoadjuvant PHESGO™ cycles (each cycle is 21 days)|Objective Response Rate by RECIST 1.1, Measures the percentage of participants achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on RECIST 1.1 criteria from enrollment to eight cycles of neoadjuvant PHESGO™, among those who complete neoadjuvant treatment. Evaluation will be conducted by the local investigator in accordance with RECIST criteria version 1.1., After eight neoadjuvant cycles of PHESGO™ (each cycle is 21 days)|Invasive Disease-Free Survival (iDFS) Stratified by pCR, Measures the time from enrollment to any occurrence of invasive disease, stratified by the presence or absence of pathologic complete response (pCR). Events for iDFS include death from any cause, locoregional or distant recurrence, new breast cancer (ipsilateral or contralateral), and second primary invasive cancer. Invasive breast cancer ipsilateral to the treatment disease is considered a recurrence. Data will be recorded regardless of therapy withdrawal after the first dose. Participants without these events at analysis times will be censored at the latest assessment date., From enrollment until an event related to invasive disease occurs, stratified by pCR, assessed up to 5 years|Event-Free Survival (EFS) Stratified by pCR, Measures the time from enrollment to the occurrence of specific events, stratified by the presence or absence of pathologic complete response (pCR). Events for EFS include death from any cause, locoregional or distant recurrence, new breast cancer (ipsilateral or contralateral), cancer progression, and second primary invasive cancer. Invasive breast cancer ipsilateral to the treatment disease is considered a recurrence. Data will be recorded regardless of therapy withdrawal after the first dose. Participants without these events at analysis times will be censored at the latest assessment date., From enrollment until an event related to EFS occurs, stratified by pCR, assessed up to 5 years|Overall Survival (OS) Stratified by pCR, Measures the time from enrollment to death due to any cause among PET responder participants, stratified by the presence or absence of pathologic complete response (pCR). Participants who have not passed away at the time of analysis will be censored based on the last recorded date when they were known to be alive. Causes of death will be recorded for comprehensive analysis., From enrollment until the participant's demise from any cause, assessed up to 5 years|Cardiac Events and Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction, Evaluates cardiac events in participants, including symptomatic ejection fraction decrease leading to heart failure (NYHA Class III or IV) with a drop in LVEF of at least 10-percentage points from baseline and below 50%. It also assesses cardiac death rates, distinguishing between definite and probable cardiac deaths. Additionally, it monitors the incidence of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction (NYHA Class II), defined by a significant LVEF decrease confirmed by a second assessment within approximately 3 weeks., Through study completion, an average of 5 years|Safety - Adverse Events, Monitors clinical and laboratory adverse events (AEs) in participants according to the National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 5.0. Summarizes AEs and includes previously known adverse events related to the medications in the study, categorized as Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) per the defined Adverse Events Definitions., Through study completion, an average of 5 years
This is a nonrandomized phase II single arm study to assess de-escalation of chemotherapy in participants with HER2-positive early breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant therapy with PHESGO™. Participants will be evaluated by central laboratory review for confirmation of selected biomarkers (pre-screening). Participants who meet the biomarker assessment criteria will follow the eligibility criteria assessment. Participants with HER2 positive disease that meet the eligibility criteria will be treated with neoadjuvant PHESGO™.

A baseline PET/CT will be performed prior to start of PHESGO™ treatment. All participants will receive fixed-dose subcutaneous formulation with pertuzumab and trastuzumab (PHESGO™) every 21 days for 3 cycles to evaluate PET/CT response. After the 3rd cycle, participants achieving PET/CT response (defined in this trial as ≥40% reduction in the SUVMax as calculated by the formula SUVbaseline SUVresponse/SUVbaseline) will continue treatment with PHESGO™ for 5 additional cycles, completing 8 neoadjuvant cycles of PHESGO™. Participants without PET/CT response after 3rd cycle will be out of study and will receive treatment and surgery according to institutional standard of care. For this cohort of participant, data regarding treatment received, pCR status and outcomes will be collected.

Definitive breast cancer surgery will be performed after the 8th cycle of therapy. After surgery, participants will receive adjuvant treatment according to their response. Participants achieving pCR will receive PHESGO™ alone as adjuvant treatment to complete a total of one year of therapy, thus receiving 10 cycles of adjuvant PHESGO™. Participants not achieving pCR will receive one of two adjuvant therapy options as per investigator's choice: (1) 14 cycles of trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), or (2) investigator's choice chemotherapy regimen (up to 6 cycles) plus 10 cycles of PHESGO™. Disease status and survival data collection will be abstracted from medical records for up to 5 years after surgery.

Participants will be followed for recurrence and survival data with abstraction of data from medical records every 3 months in first year after surgery; every 4 months in second and third years; and then annually until five years. Medical procedures and therapies in the follow-up period are not a formal investigational part of this clinical trial and therefore will be performed according to the institutional standard of care.
