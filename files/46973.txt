A Study of JNJ-90301900 in Combination With Chemoradiation Followed by Consolidation Immunotherapy for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
The purpose of this study is to determine whether JNJ-90301900 added to concurrent platinum-based doublet chemotherapy with radiation therapy (cCRT) followed by consolidation immunotherapy (cIT) can improve objective response rate (ORR; that is percentage of participants whose best response is complete response or partial response during the study) in participants with locally advanced and unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
DRUG: JNJ-90301900|BIOLOGICAL: Durvalumab|RADIATION: Concurrent Chemo/Radiation Therapy (cCRT)|DRUG: Concurrent Chemo/Radiation Therapy (cCRT): Carboplatin|DRUG: Concurrent Chemo/Radiation Therapy (cCRT): Paclitaxel
Objective Response Rate (ORR) Using Independent Central Review (ICR) Assessment, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who have a best response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) version (v) 1.1 using ICR assessments., Up to 2 Years and 2 months
Disease Response Rate Post-cCRT and Pre-cIT, Disease response rate is defined as percentage of participants who achieve CR or PR, post-concurrent platinum-based doublet chemotherapy with radiation therapy (cCRT) and pre-consolidation immunotherapy (cIT) based on investigator's assessment according to RECIST v1.1., Up to 12 Weeks|Disease Control Rate (DCR) Post-cCRT and Pre-cIT, DCR is defined as percentage of participants who achieve CR, PR and stable disease post-cCRT and pre-cIT based on investigator's assessment according to RECIST v1.1., Up to 12 Weeks|Objective Response Rate (ORR) as Assessed by the Investigator, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who have a best response of CR or PR using RECIST v1.1 as assessed by the investigator., Up to 2 Years and 2 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the enrollment/randomization until disease progression or death due to any cause according to RECIST v1.1., Up to 2 Years and 2 months|Duration of Response (DoR), DoR will be calculated among responders from the date of initial documentation of a response to the date of first documented evidence of relapse according to RECIST v1.1, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 2 Years and 2 months|Time to Locoregional Failure (LRF), Time to LRF is defined as the time from enrollment/randomization to the first LRF using ICR assessments., Up to 2 Years and 2 months|Time to Distant Failure (DF), Time to DF is defined as the time from enrollment/randomization to the first DF using ICR assessments., Up to 2 Years and 2 months|Number of Participants with Treatment-Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE) Related to Study Treatment, TEAE is defined as any new or worsening adverse event (AE) occurring at or after the initial administration of study treatment through the day of last dose of study treatment received plus 30 days or prior to the start of subsequent anticancer therapy (non-durvalumab), whichever is earlier, or any follow-up AE with onset date and time beyond 30 days after the last dose of study treatment but prior to the start of subsequent anticancer therapy, or any AE that is considered treatment-related regardless of the start date of the event. TEAEs related to JNJ-90301900 injection procedure, JNJ-90301900, RT, ChT, or cIT will be reported., Up to 2 Years and 2 months|Number of Participants Reporting Laboratory Parameters, Physical Examination, Vital Signs Including Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status Abnormalities, Participants with laboratory parameters, physical examination, vital signs including ECOG performance status abnormalities will be reported., Up to 2 Years and 2 months
