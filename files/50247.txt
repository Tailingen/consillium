Comparative Study of the Hypoxia Measured in FAZA and F-miso PET/CT Scan in Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of the study is to compare the intratumoral biodistribution of FAZA and F-miso in patients with non-small cell lung cancer and correlate the results of PET scans with immunohistochemistry.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DEVICE: Miso PET scan|DEVICE: FAZA PET scan
Comparison of hypoxia with FAZA and F-Miso tracer, SUV max, SUV mean and SUV peak were calculated for FAZA PET and Fmiso PET and will be correlated with results of immunohistochemistry, one year
overall survival, time between inclusion and the death whatever the cause, one year|disease-free survival, time between inclusion and the progression or death, one year
The aim of the study is to compare the biodistribution of the two tracers specific for hypoxia in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

Two PET scans will be performed with FAZA and F-Miso tracers. The time between these twi PET scans will be 24 hours.

another 24 hours after the late PET scan, the surgery will be done and a piece of tumor will be collected.

Piece of tumor will be analysed by immunohistochemistry for hypoxia markers.

The results of immunohistochemistry will be correlated with the biodistribution of the two tracers.
