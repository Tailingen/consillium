Study on Proton Radiotherapy of Thymic Malignancies
This is a multicentre non-randomized phase II study of proton beam radiotherapy in patients with thymic epithelial tumours (i.e. thymoma and thymic carcinoma) in the post-operative setting or in inoperable patients with localized disease.

Patients not willing or for any reason unsuitable to undergo proton treatment will be asked to participate in a follow-up assessment after the regular photon treatment in the same manner as the included patients.

Primary endpoints are:Toxicity (e.g. cardiac and pulmonary toxicity) and Local control at 5 year Secondary endpoints: PFS, Overall survival, Quality of life, measured by EORTC QLQ 30 + LC 13 and relapse pattern
Cardiotoxicity|Pulmonary Toxicity|Thymus Neoplasms
RADIATION: Proton radiation
Cardiotoxicity and pulmonary toxicity of therapy, Proportion of patients with cardiac and pulmonary toxicity measured by CTCAE 4.0 \> Grade 2, At 60 months from treatment|Local tumor control, Freedom from tumor progression (CR,PR or SD) mesured by CT-scan, At 60 months from treatment
Quality of life questionnaire EORTC QLQ 30 (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer), Scale from 1-100 for 30 items, higher score indicates a better situation., At 60 months from treatment|Quality of life questionnaire LC13 (Lung cancer specific module of EORTC), Scale from 1-100 for 13 items and higher score indicates worse symptoms., At 60 months from treatment|Survival, Overall survival, From treatment and for 5 years
All doses are recorded in Gy(RBE).

After having checked all eligibility criteria patients will receive:

* Patients with radical surgery and unfavourable histology (B2, B3, C) and/or Masaoka-Koga stage III, IVa: 2 Gy(RBE), once daily, five days a week to a total dose of 50 Gy(RBE).
* Patients with non-radical surgery (R1 resection) regardless of stage and histology: 2.3 Gy(RBE), once daily, 5 days a week to a total dose of 57.5 Gy(RBE)
* Inoperable patients regardless of stage and histology and patients with R2 non-radical resection: 2.5 Gy (RBE), once daily, 5 days a week to a total dose of 62.5 Gy(RBE)
* Patients not willing to participate in study will receive photon therapy according to local practice (â‰¥45 Gy)

Induction or adjuvant chemotherapy may be used according to local practice. Concomitant chemotherapy is not allowed.
