Mantle Cell Lymphoma|Refractory Lymphoma
DRUG: Acalabrutinib|DRUG: Venetoclax|DRUG: Obinutuzumab
Recommended Phase 2 Dose for acalabrutinib, The RP2D will be defined as the highest dose level for which there are no more than 1/6 DLTs observed., 5 months|Complete Remission Rate, Complete remission (CR) rate after 7 cycles of treatment with AVO in treatment naïve (TN) transplant ineligible MCL and TN transplant-eligible, TP53 mutated MCL, cohort B.

Complete remission (CR) is defined radiographically using 2014 Lugano criteria and a negative bone marrow biopsy by histology, immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometry, if bone marrow was initially involved by MCL at screening. CR, a primary endpoint measured after 7 cycles of AVO, does not incorporate minimal residual disease (MRD) testing, 7 Months|MRD negative complete remission rate, Minimal residual disease (MRD) negative (\<1 in 106 cells) CR rate after 7 cycles of treatment with AVO in TN transplant-eligible, TP53 wild type MCL, cohort C, 7 months
Complete Remission (CR) rate after 7 cycles in the entire study population, Complete remission (CR) is defined radiographically using 2014 Lugano criteria and a negative bone marrow biopsy by histology, immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometry, if bone marrow was initially involved by MCL at screening. CR, a primary endpoint measured after 7 cycles of AVO, does not incorporate minimal residual disease (MRD) testing, 7 months|CR rate after 7 cycles cohort A and C, Complete remission (CR) is defined radiographically using 2014 Lugano criteria and a negative bone marrow biopsy by histology, immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometry, if bone marrow was initially involved by MCL at screening. CR, a primary endpoint measured after 7 cycles of AVO, does not incorporate minimal residual disease (MRD) testing, 7 Months|Partial Response (PR) Rate after 7 cycles, 2014 Lugano Criteria, 7 months|Stable Disease Rate after 7 cycles, Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements., 7 months|Progressive Disease Rate after 7 Cycles, Lugano 2014 criteria, 7 months|Progression Free Survival-Median, Kaplan Meier Progression-Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from randomization (or registration) to the earlier of progression or death due to any cause.

Participants alive without disease progression are censored at date of last disease evaluation, Up to 5 Years|Progression Free Survival, Kaplan Meier Progression-Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from randomization (or registration) to the earlier of progression or death due to any cause. Participants alive without disease progression are censored at date of last disease evaluation, Up to 5 years|Overall Survival, Kaplan Meier- Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from randomization (or registration) to death due to any cause, or censored at date last known alive., Up to 5 years|Overall Survival-Median, Kaplan Meier Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from randomization (or registration) to death due to any cause, or censored at date last known alive., Up to 5 years|Rate of peripheral blood MRD-negativity after 7 cycles, Minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity is defined as 0 residual clonal cells per 1 x 106 nucleated cells in the peripheral blood assessed by the clonoSEQ® assay. The clonoSEQ assay uses next generation sequencing (NGS) to identify rearranged IgH (VDJ), IgH (DJ), IgK, and IgL receptor gene sequences, as well as translocated BCL1/IgH (J) sequences in a sample, 7 months|Time to Minimal Residual Disease (MRD)-positive disease recurrence in the peripheral blood, Time to MRD-positive disease recurrence, in patients who have achieved MRD negativity, Up to 8 months|Time to clinical disease progression, Time to Progression (TTP) is defined as the time from randomization (or registration) to progression, or censored at date of last disease evaluation for those without progression reported, Up to 5 years|Rate of infusion related reactions, Some participants may develop hypersensitivity or other infusion-related reactions (IRRs) to obinutuzumab, pre-medication is recommended to reduce the risk of infusion reactions. Premedication will be given as outlined in protocol. Cycle numbers are specific to this trial, Up to 5 years|Rate of tumor lysis syndrome, criteria of laboratory TLS or clinical TLS according to the Cairo-Bishop definition of TLS, 7 Months|Rate of therapy discontinuation, descriptive analysis of rates of therapy discontinuation after 10 cycles will be performed, with subjects grouped by reasons for discontinuation (e.g. achievement of MRD-negative CR, progressive disease, or intolerability). Rates of discontinuation of individual components of the regimen will also be included in this analysis., 10 Months|Number of Participants with Treatment Related Adverse Events CTCAE 5.0 criteria, Grade 3 and higher toxicities, both regardless of attribution, and at least possibly attributed to the study treatment

* Grade 2 or higher toxicity at least probably related to study treatment
* Adverse events leading to discontinuation due to toxicity

NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0, up to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment or until resolution of toxicity to grade 1 or baseline, whichever occurs last up to 5 years
This is an open-label, investigator-initiated, single-arm, multi-cohort phase 1/2 study to assess the safety and efficacy of the combination of acalabrutinib, venetoclax, and obinutuzumab (AVO) in relapsed/refractory (R/R) and untreated mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).

The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including evaluations and follow up visits.

The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:

* Acalabrutinib
* Venetoclax
* Obinutuzumab

Participants will receive study treatment for as long as there are no serious side effects and the disease does not get worse. Participants will be followed for 5 years.

It is expected that 53 people will take part in this research study.

This is a Phase I/II clinical trial. Phase I clinical trials test the safety of investigational drugs and also tries to define the appropriate dose of investigational drugs to use for further studies. "Investigational" means that the drugs are being studied.

* The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved venetoclax and obinutuzumab for this specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.
* The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved acalabrutinib as a treatment option for this disease.
