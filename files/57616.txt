Chemotherapy, Radiation Therapy, and Cetuximab in Treating Patients With the Head and Neck Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Giving chemotherapy together with radiation therapy and cetuximab may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well chemotherapy given together with radiation therapy and cetuximab works in treating patients with head and neck cancer.
Head and Neck Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: cetuximab|DRUG: cisplatin|RADIATION: radiation therapy
Disease-free survival at 2 years, 2 YEARS
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Evaluate disease-free survival at 2 years in patients with poor prognosis squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck treated with chemoradiotherapy and cetuximab after complete surgical resection.

Secondary

* Evaluate quality of life.
* Evaluate tolerability.
* Evaluate overall survival.
* Analyze germinal polymorphisms.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive cetuximab IV on day 1. Treatment with cetuximab repeats every week for up to 8 courses. Patients also receive cisplatin IV on day 8. Treatment with cisplatin repeats every 3 weeks for up to 3 courses. Patients undergo concurrent radiotherapy 5 times a week for 7 weeks beginning on day 8.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 month and then every 3 months for 2 years.
