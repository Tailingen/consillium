Predicting Neoadjuvant Therapy Response of Rectal Cancer With MRI
The purpose of this study is to investigate if MRI scans performed after neoadjuvant radiotherapy can predict the therapeutic response of rectal cancer following preoperative chemo-radiotherapy. This will help doctors to better tailor treatments for rectal cancer in the future.
Rectal Neoplasms
DEVICE: three MR examination
Predictive value of eary MRI (14-16 days MRI) for assessing pathological complete response(pCR) at surgery, A scoring system for predicting pCR will be developed based on MRI parameters and their changes between baseline and early MRI. No viable cancer cells seen in the resection specimen is regarded as pCR, 2 years|Predictive value of preoperative MRI(7-9 weeks after the completion of preoperative chemo-radiotherapy) for assessing pCR, A scoring system for predicting pCR will be developed based on MRI parameters, 2 years
Predictive value of eary MRI (14-16 days after initiation of preoperative radio-chemotherapy) for assessing pathological response according to Tumour Regression Grade (TRG), A scoring system for predicting pathological response will be developed based on MRI parameters and their changes between baseline and early MRI.TRG1 is regarded as responder, and TRG2/3 is regarded as non-responder., 2 years|Feasibility of conducting MRI scans at 7-9 weeks after preoperative radio-chemotherapy, This will be assessed in terms of whether MR imaging at 7-9 weeks after preoperative radio-chemotherapy adds any additional predictive value to imaging performed 14-16 days after initiation of preoperative radio-chemotherapy., 2 years|MRI-predicted pCR and MRI-predicted response on long-term disease control and survival, 3 years disease-free survival and overall survival will be assessed, 3 years|Predictive value of preoperative MRI(7-9 weeks after the completion of preoperative chemo-radiotherapy) for assessing pathological response according to Tumour Regression Grade (TRG), A scoring system for predicting pathological response will be developed based on MRI parameters and their changes between baseline and early MRI.TRG1 is regarded as responder, and TRG2/3 is regarded as non-responder., 2 years
We proposed to constructed multi-parameter predictive model for predicting therapeutic response and pathological complete response(pCR) of patients with rectal cancer who received neoadjuvant chemoradiation. MR radiomics,convolutional neural networks, morphological parameters and quantitative functional parameters derived from diffusion-weighted MR images will be integrated for model construction.
