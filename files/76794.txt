Durvalumab Plus CV301 With Maintenance Chemotherapy in Metastatic Colorectal or Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
This is a dual arm, open label phase I/II study to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of the combination of durvalumab with CV301 in combination with maintenance chemotherapy for patients with metastatic colorectal or pancreatic cancer whose disease is stable on, or responding to 1st line therapy for metastatic disease. Patients with metastatic colorectal or pancreatic adenocarcinoma who still have an adequate performance status and normal hepatic and renal function will be eligible.

Recommended Phase II Dose of Durvalumab, The Recommended Phase II dose of durvalumab in the combination of durvalumab plus CV301 with maintenance chemotherapy as determined by the Phase I design, 6 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS) Colorectal Cancer, To determine the progression free survival (PFS) of durvalumab plus CV301 in combination with maintenance capecitabine and bevacizumab in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, whose disease is stable on, or responding to 1st line therapy for metastatic disease, 24 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS) Pancreatic Cancer, To determine the progression free survival rate (PFS) of durvalumab plus CV301 in combination with maintenance capecitabine in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer, whose disease is stable on, or responding to 1st line therapy for metastatic disease, 24 months
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of patients whose best overall response recorded during treatment is either CR or PR according to the RECIST version 1.1., 1 year|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from consenting to determination of tumor progression by RECIST version 1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., 24 months|Overall Survival (OS), To determine overall survival, subjects will be followed from time of consent until death (or until study termination). Subject will be followed for survival after discontinuing study medication and after the adverse event collection period has ended., 4 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the proportion of patients with a documented CR, PR, or SD at 4 months according to the RECIST version 1.1., 4 months|Tolerability and Safety of the Combination, Tolerability and safety of the combination as determined by the number of patients with treatment emergent adverse events, 2 years|Duration of Response, The duration of response will also be captured as the time from which a response was first identified, until progression of disease according to the RECIST version 1.1 (or death due to any cause)., 1 year
