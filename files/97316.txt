Venetoclax Resistance Landscape in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
The purpose of this study is to collect medical informations and samples from refractory and/or relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia during or after venetoclax treatment, in order to evaluate the frequency of resistance mechanisms.

The purpose of this study is to collect medical informations and samples (blood, bone marrow and/or lymph node) from refractory and/or relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia during or after venetoclax treatment, in order to evaluate the frequency of resistance mechanisms (BCL2 mutations, over-expression of other members of the BCL2 protein family and energy metabolism changes).
