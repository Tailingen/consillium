A Phase II Trial of Sacituzumab Govitecan in Patients With Advanced Thymic Epithelial Tumors
The goal of this clinical trial is to study the effect of sacituzumab govitecan-hziy in adult patients with advanced thymoma and thymic carcinoma after progressing on at least one prior line of therapy.

The main question it aims to answer is:

• What is the overall response rate (ORR) in patients with advanced thymoma and thymic carcinoma?

Participants will:

* receive a fixed dose of 10 mg/kg given intravenously, once weekly on Days 1 and 8 of continuous 21-day treatment cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity
* have regular blood tests, scans, and examinations to monitor their health.
* have blood and a biopsy of their tumor for research purposes.
Thymoma|Thymic Carcinoma
DRUG: Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy
Overall Response Rate (ORR), Objective response is defined a confirmed overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as assessed by RECIST v1.1. The objective response rate (ORR) will be estimated number of evaluable patients with a documented objective response divided by the total number of evaluable patients., 1 year
Duration of response (DOR), DOR will be evaluated in evaluable patients who had a documented objective response. This is the time from the documented objective response, as assessed by RECIST v1.1, until disease progression or death, whichever occurs first. Patients who are alive without a documented disease progression will be censored at the time of their last disease evaluation., 1 year|Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the time of treatment initiation until disease progression or death, whichever occurs first. Patients who are alive without a documented progression will be censored at the time of their last disease evaluation, 1 year|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time of treatment initiation until death. Patients who are alive will be censored at the time of their last contact., 1 year
