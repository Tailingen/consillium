Cohort Construction and Prognostic Model Construction for Multiple Myeloma
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a disease caused by malignant plasma cell proliferation disorder. Survival outcomes continue to vary widely even within uniformly treated clinical trial populations. How to construct a clinical prognosis model of MM through real-world data to guide the selection of treatment options, standardize patient management, and improve survival expectations, is a major problem that needs to be solved urgently. It is necessary to build an MM-specific cohort in China to comprehensively understand the characteristics of MM patients, explore treatment options, and improve prognostic factors for survival outcomes.

Overall survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from being treated to death from any cause., 5 years
Progression free survival(PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from being treated to disease progression or death from any cause., 5years
