Phase I/II Study of SY-3505 in Patients With ALK-positive Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a phase I/II, open-label and multi-center study of SY-3505, a third-generation ALK TKI, in patients with advanced ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (ALK-positive NSCLC).

The study consists of two parts:

Part 1: Dose-escalation and dose-expansion in patients with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC, including 9 SY-3505 dose levels.

Dose-escalation study phase is designed to determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) according to a 3+3 design and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) and to characterize the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of SY-3505. Other dose regimens may be explored based on the analysis of emerging PK and safety data. At this study phase, SY-3505 administered orally once daily (QD) in 28-day treatment cycles to adult patients with ALK-positive NSCLC. Dose-expansion study is designed to evaluate the antitumor activity (ORR, DCR and DoR) of SY-3505 at selected doses in ALK-positive NSCLC patients who have received at least 1 prior ALK TKI therapy.

Part 2: Phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy of SY-3505.

This phase is designed to determine the antitumor activity (ORR, DCR, DoR, PFS and OS), safety, and PK of SY-3505 at RP2D in ALK-positive NSCLC patients who have received alectinib only or ≥2 prior ALK TKIs.
