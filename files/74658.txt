Pre-Salpingo-Oophorectomy Pilot Study of MAKO 7 Device Performance
This study evaluates the ability of the MAKO 7 device to collect various cells
BRCA1 Mutation|BRCA2 Mutation|Atypia Suspicious for Malignancy
DEVICE: MAKO 7
Concordance Between Cytological Findings From Fallopian Tubes to Surgical Histology Results., Cytological evaluations of samples collected from fallopian tubes were performed in a blinded fashion to histology findings from excised fallopian tubes and ovaries. Concordance was evaluated between cytology where collected samples were adequate and available histology., Up to 60 days post-operatively
Prospective, multi-center observational study to evaluate the ability of the MAKO 7 device to collect cells from the fallopian tubes for cytological evaluation for determination and/or differentiation of normal versus atypical versus malignant cells.
