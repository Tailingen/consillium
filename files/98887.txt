Adjuvant Treatment of Concurrent RT and CAPOX or Capecitabine Alone for Stage II and III Rectal Cancer
The purpose of this study is:

* To compare the long-term of survival and local/regional control between the two postoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy regimens: capecitabine vs. oxaliplatin and capecitabine,for stage II and III rectal cancer
* To compare the toxicity profile between the two different concurrent chemoradiotherapy regimens.

Adjuvant 5-FU based concurrent chemoradiotherapy and chemotherapy is the standard care for locally advanced stage II-III rectal cancer, based on several randomized Phase III clinical trials. With this standard treatment, 5-year local failure rate and distant metastasis rate is 10% and around 35%, respectively. Capecitabine, an analog of 5-fluoruracil (5FU), was demonstrated to have similar treatment results compared to 5-FU, but have much lower toxicities. Oxaliplatin based chemotherapy, also showed a better disease-free survival rate compared with 5-FU based-regimen. So far, some Phase I/II studies have shown the safety and preliminary results of either concurrent chemotherapy of capecitabine or oxaliplatin and capecitabine. The long-term results in comparison of capecitabine concurrent chemoradiotherapy with oxaliplatin/capecitabine concurrent chemoradiotherapy need to be further analyzed.
