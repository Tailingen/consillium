Safety and Efficacy of Metabolically Armed CD19 CAR-T Cells (Meta10-19) in the Treatment of r/r DLBCL Clinical Research
A Study of Metabolically Armed CD19 CAR-T Cells Therapy for Patients With Relapsed and/or Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma
Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Metabolically Armed CD19 CAR-T cells
MTD, Determine the Maximal Tolerable Dose(MTD), MTD will be determined based on DLTs observed during the first 28 days of study treatment.|Objective response rate (ORR), Measure Tumor response rate (including CR and PR) ., Within 3 months following infusion of Meta10-19
Pharmacokinetics, The number of CAR-T cells in peripheral blood was measured to evaluate the persistence of CAR-T cells, Up to 12 months after CAR-T treatment|Pharmacodynamics, Peak level of cytokines in peripheral blood, Up to 28 days after infusion
This is a single arm, open-label study. This study is indicated for relapsed or refractory CD19+ Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma. The selections of dose levels and the number of subjects are based on clinical trials of similar foreign products.

1. Main research objectives:

   To evaluate the safety and efficacy of metabolically armed CD19 CAR-T Cells in the treatment of r/r DLBCL.
2. Secondary research objectives:

（1）To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamics(PD) characteristics of metabolically armed CD19 CAR-T Cells after infusion.

（2）To evaluate tumor remission after infusion of metabolically armed CD19 CAR-T Cells.
