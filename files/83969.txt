Implementing the NYU Electronic Patient Visit Assessment (ePVA) for Head and Neck Cancer In Rural and Urban Populations
The PI and the research team developed the New York University (NYU) Electronic Patient Visit Assessment (ePVA) for head and neck cancer (HNC) as a patient-reported outcome measure (PRO) for the early detection of uncontrolled symptoms. The ePVA is digital patient-reported symptom monitoring system, providing actionable information at point-of-care that enables clinicians to provide real-time interventions. The study aims to advance the science of cancer care delivery by testing the effectiveness of the ePVA as a digital patient-reported monitoring system for patients with HNC in real-world settings and identify implementation strategies that optimize the effectiveness of the ePVA in diverse rural and urban settings. The study hypothesis is that participants assigned to the ePVA arm will have better swallowing, taste and smell, and social function than participants assigned to usual care arm at 4 weeks after completing radiation therapy.
Head and Neck Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: NYU Electronic Patient Visit Assessment (ePVA)|BEHAVIORAL: Usual Care
Head and neck cancer (HNC) symptoms as assessed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaires (QLQ), The EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-H\&N35 will be used to measure head and neck cancer symptoms, such as social function, senses of taste and smell, and swallowing. The scores will be summed and then transformed to a single score ranging from 0=Best to 100=Worst., 4 weeks after completing radiation therapy
Pain as assessed by EORTC QLQ-H&N35 Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ), The EORTC QLQ-H\&N35 will be used to assess pain. The score will be summed and then transformed to a single score ranging from 0=Best to 100=Worst., 4 weeks after completing radiation therapy|Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) as assessed by the EORTC QLQ-C30 Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ), The EORTC QLQ-H\&N35 will be used to assess Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL). The score will be summed and then transformed to a single score ranging from 0=Best to 100=Worst., 4 weeks after completing radiation therapy|Acute Care Services Use as assessed by number of acute care visits, Acute Care Services Use is the use of services delivered in acute care settings, such as feeding tube placements, emergency room visits, and hospitalizations., 4 weeks after completing radiation therapy|Acute Care Services Use as assessed by number of days of using acute care, Acute Care Services Use is the use of services delivered in acute care settings, such as feeding tube placements, emergency room visits, and hospitalizations., 4 weeks after completing radiation therapy
