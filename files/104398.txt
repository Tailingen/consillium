Study of Probiotics Combined With Concurrent Hyperfractionated ChemoRadiotherapy and Adebrelimab Immunomaintenance in the Treatment of Limited-stage Small Cell Lung Cancer (LS-SCLC)
ADRIATIC study explored the benefits of immune maintenance therapy after LS-SCLC radiotherapy and chemotherapy. In the presence of immunotherapy, is it necessary to increase the dosage of radiotherapy and can it further improve the efficacy? This study aims to explore the efficacy and safety of simultaneous integrated boost hyperfractionation radiotherapy combined with probiotics and Adalberg monoclonal antibody consolidation therapy for small cell lung cancer.
