Clinical Study of Envafolimab Combined With Fruquintinib and Chemotherapy for Neoadjuvant Treatment of Gastric Cancer
To observe and evaluate the neoadjuvant treatment of Envafolimab combined with Fruquintinib and chemotherapy for locally advanced gastric/gastroesophageal junction carcinoma
Gastric Cancer
DRUG: Envafolimab|DRUG: Fruquintinib
Major pathological response rate (MPR), MPR is defined as the proportion of neoadjuvant therapy induced tumor regression with pathologically remaining tumor \< 10%, up to 12 months
Pathological complete response rate (pCR), pCR is defined as the proportion of patients who do not have residual cancer cells on pathological examination after treatment, up to 12 months|Pathological response rate (pRR), pRR is defined as the proportion of patients whose pathologic examination after treatment found no cancer cells remaining or whose cancer cells remaining within a pre-specified value range, up to 12 months|Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of patients whose best overall assessment is a complete or partial response., up to 12 months|Disease-free survival (DFS), DFS is defined as the time between a patient's enrollment and the onset of tumor recurrence or death from any cause, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 10 years|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time until a patient is enrolled and dies from any cause, From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 10 years|R0 removal rate, R0 resection rate was defined as the proportion of patients with complete resection of the tumor and a negative submicroscopic margin, i.e. no residual tumor, up to 24 weeks
Relationship between tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis and clinical outcomes, Investigate the relationship between tumor angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis (including but not limited to immunohistochemical detection of CD31, CD3, CD8, etc. expression) and the clinical outcomes (PFS, OS, ORR, etc.) of patients, Through study completion, an average of 1 year
This study observed and evaluated the major pathological response rate (MPR), pathological complete response rate (pCR), pathological response rate (pRR), objective response rate (ORR), R0 removal rate, disease-free survival (DFS) of Envafolimab combined with Fruquintinib and chemotherapy in neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced gastric/gastroesophageal junctional cancer. Overall survival (OS) and security. The relationship between tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis and clinical outcome of patients (including but not limited to immunohistochemical detection of CD31, CD3, CD8, etc.) was also explored.
