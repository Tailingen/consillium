CAVATAK (CVA21) in Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (VLA-012 CANON)
The study consisted of 2 sequential parts. Part A assessed the safety and tolerability of CAVATAK administered via intravesical instillation in patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer scheduled to undergo TUR. Part B assessed the safety and tolerability of CAVATAK administered in sequential combination with low dose Mitomycin C in the same patient population.
Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: CVA21|DRUG: Mitomycin C
Incidence of Dose-limiting Toxicities Treatment-related Adverse Events., Number of Participants with Treatment-emergent adverse events. The events for each cohort of dose of CVA21 only are pooled for the analysis., 30 days from last dose
This was a Phase I, two-part, open-label, dose-escalation study designed to evaluate CVA21 alone and in sequential combination with low-dose mitomycin C in patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) who were candidates for and were planning to undergo TUR for treatment of their disease. This gave a relatively homogeneous study population and facilitated collection of resected tumour tissue for histological, pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses.
