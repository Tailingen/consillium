CombIning advaNces in imagiNg With biOmarkers for improVed Diagnosis of Aggressive prosTate cancEr
To enable the paradigm of mp-MRI before biopsy in all patients with suspected prostate cancer by better selecting patients who will benefit from diagnostic MRI and by improving the performance of the mp-MRI itself
Prostate Cancer
OTHER: MRI
Diagnostic accuracy of VERDICT MRI, Radiological assessment with added VERDICT MRI improves the specificity of mp-MRI for detection of significant prostate cancer by \>10% above standard multi-parametric MRI alone., 3 - 6 months (after targeted biopsy or follow up MRI)
Patients will undergo an advanced diffusion-weighted MRI sequence called VERDICT with the intention of better characterising prostate cancer. A panel of serum and urine biomarkers will also be analysed, which we hope will predict those patients who go on have a positive MRI.

OBJECTIVES:

* To establish a fluidic marker - prostate MRI paradigm which: (i) utilises fluidic markers to rationalise selection of patients with significant prostate cancer; and (ii) improves the diagnostic accuracy of imaging over and above standard multiparametric (mp) MRI
* Enable a pathway for rapid clinical evaluation of emerging fluidic markers and exosomes
* Assess the repeatability of VERDICT MRI
* Ascertain whether VERDICT derived quantitative parameters correlate with quantitative histological parameters
* Develop a database of fluidic marker and VERDICT characterised, mp-MRI, histologically validated patients for subsequent exploratory and longitudinal outcome analysis
