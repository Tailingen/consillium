A Study of BL-M07D1 in Patients With HER2-expressing Recurrent or Metastatic Gynecologic Malignancies
This study is a single-arm, open, multicenter, non-randomized phase Ib/II clinical study evaluating the efficacy and safety of BL-M07D1 for injection in patients with HER2-expressing recurrent or metastatic gynecologic malignancies.
Gynecological Malignancies
DRUG: BL-M07D1
Phase Ib: Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D), The RP2D is defined as the dose level chosen by the sponsor (in consultation with the investigators) for phase II study, based on safety, tolerability, efficacy, PK, and PD data collected during the dose escalation study of BL-M07D1., Up to approximately 24 months|Phase II: Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants, who has a CR (disappearance of all target lesions) or PR (at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions). The percentage of participants who experiences a confirmed CR or PR is according to RECIST 1.1., Up to approximately 24 months
Treatment-Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE), TEAE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally emerging, or any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition during the treatment of BL-M07D1. The type, frequency and severity of TEAE will be evaluated during the treatment of BL-M07D1., Up to approximately 24 months|Phase Ib: Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants, who has a CR (disappearance of all target lesions) or PR (at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions). The percentage of participants who experiences a confirmed CR or PR is according to RECIST 1.1., Up to approximately 24 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), The DCR is defined as the percentage of participants who has a CR, PR, or Stable Disease (SD: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease \[PD: at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD\])., Up to approximately 24 months|Duration of Response (DOR), The DOR for a responder is defined as the time from the participant's initial objective response to the first date of either disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 24 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS), The PFS is defined as the time from the participant's first dose of BL-M07D1 to the first date of either disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 24 months|Cmax, Maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of BL-M07D1 will be investigated., Up to approximately 24 months|Tmax, Time to maximum serum concentration (Tmax) of BL-M07D1 will be investigated., Up to approximately 24 months|Ctrough, Ctrough is defined as the lowest serum concentration of BL-M07D1 prior to the next dose will be administered., Up to approximately 24 months|ADA (anti-drug antibody), Frequency of anti-BL-M07D1 antibody (ADA) will be investigated., Up to approximately 24 months
