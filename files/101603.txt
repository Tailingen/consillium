A Study With Pembrolizumab in Combination With Dual Anti-HER2 Blockade With Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab in Early Breast Cancer Patients With Molecular HER2-enriched Intrinsic Subtype (Keyriched-1)
Keyriched-1 is a multicenter, interventional, prospective, single arm, open label, neoadjuvant phase II trial evaluating the pathological complete response (pCR) rate induced by pembrolizumab in combination with the dual anti-HER2 blockade consisting of trastuzumab biosimilar ABP 980 and pertuzumab in early breast cancer patients with molecular HER2-enriched intrinsic subtype tested by PAM50.

HER2-positive breast cancer is best defined by multiparameter gene expression profiling rather than analysis of the overexpression/amplification status of only HER2. As this subgroup is often correlated with a high expression of TILs and PD/PD-L1, immunogenic therapy strategies seem very promising. The pCR highly correlates with the overall outcome of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer \[7\]. Therefore, the pCR rate after neoadjuvant treatment has been adopted as a surrogate endpoint and, more recently, as a basis for accelerated drug approval \[38\].

Due to the high number of patients achieving a pCR after standard treatment of anti-HER2 therapy combined with chemotherapy, de-escalated strategies seem promising and designing a chemotherapy-free trial regimen is therefore modern, justifiable and of high scientific value. Therefore, we designed a prospective phase II, single arm, hypothesis-generating trial investigating the rate of pCR in patients with HER2-enriched breast cancer receiving four cycles of dual anti-HER2 blockade in combination with the checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab. Further translational research will be added to gain further insight into the tumor response or resistance to this treatment approach. The addition of standard chemotherapy after this study treatment will be at the discretion of the investigator. In case of a non-pCR after study treatment, continuing treatment with chemotherapy and antihormonal therapy in case of HR positive disease is highly recommended.
