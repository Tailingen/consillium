National Study of Adrenal Tumours
This is a study putting together large numbers of patients with or without a hereditary risk of adrenal tumours including tumours such as adrenocortical carcinoma and phaeochromocytoma/paraganglioma. The purpose is to answer questions about the survival of patients with these rare tumours and to do this, we will collect information on diagnosis and management of these tumours. This data will be best assessed by combing these rare cases at a national level recruiting from centres throughout UK and Ireland. The information will be confidential and stored in a secure platform.

Patients will be approached for consent to gather their data by their local consultants and patients will have the choice to participate or decline participation, which will not affect their standard of care treatment.
