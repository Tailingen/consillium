Preoperative Biliary Drainage in Malignant Biliary Obstruction
The first alarming symptom of a malignancy of the pancreas or periampullary tumor can be obstructive jaundice (OJ). Pancreato-duodenectomy (PD) combined with oncological treatment can provide long disease-free survival in resectable cases. The literature regarding the preoperative biliary drainage is controversial. The aim of this multicenter, prospective observational cohort study is to investigate the role of preoperative drainage, and to compare it with surgery alone.
