Multiple Ascending Dose of BMS-911543
The purpose of this first in human study is to determine if BMS-911543 is safe and tolerable in subjects with symptomatic intermediate-1, intermediate-2 or high risk myelofibrosis to permit clinical testing at the Maximum Tolerated Dose or at a Clinically Active Dose, and to determine if BMS-911543 will demonstrate efficacy in symptomatic myelofibrosis.

Number of Participants With Adverse Events, Safety assessments were based on a medical review of adverse event reports and the results of vital sign measurements, ECGs, physical examinations, and clinical laboratory tests and were evaluated for all treated participants using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 (NCI CTCAE v.4.0)., From the date of participant's written consent until 30 days post discontinuation of dosing or participation in the study if the last scheduled visit occured at a later time, assessed up to 4.5 years|Number of Participants With Best Overall Response, Participants were clinically assessed for IWG-(International Working Group consensus criteria for treatment response in myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia) defined response at each returning on-treatment visit and the first post-treatment visit. IWG-MRT criteria for best overall response are ordered high to low: CR\>PR\>CI\>SD\>PD\>R where CR = Complete Remission, PR= Partial Remission, CI = Clinical Improvement, SD = Stable Disease, PD = Progressive Disease and R = Relapse. Best overall response is the best response of the subject during the treatment period or at the first post-treatment visit., Day 1, at each returning on-treatment visit and the first post-treatment visit
Changes in (Janus Kinase) JAK/Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STATs) Pathway Activities, Circulating CD34+ Cells and Plasma Cytokine Levels, JAK/STAT pathway activity will be evaluated by: 1) pSTATs levels using immunoassay; 2) expression levels of several JAK/STATs pathway genes.
