the Impact of Early Palliative Care on the Survival of Locally Advanced and / or Metastatic Cholangiocarcinoma Patients

We will also assess whether early management by a palliative care team could impact progression-free survival, the place of death and the date of the last chemotherapy, in particular to avoid unnecessary chemotherapy cures in an imminent end of life
