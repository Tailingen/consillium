Expanded/Activated Gamma Delta T-cell Infusion Following Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation and Post-transplant Cyclophosphamide
Gamma delta T-cells are part of the innate immune system with the ability to recognize malignant cells and kill them. This study uses gamma delta T-cells to maximize the anti-tumor response and minimize graft versus host disease (GVHD) in leukemic and myelodysplastic patients who have had a partially mismatched bone marrow transplant (haploidentical).

DRUG: EAGD T-cell infusion (Phase I)|DRUG: EAGD T-cell infusion (Expansion)
Phase I - Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), The dose escalation strategy will follow the Food and Drug Administration Guideline for design of early phase clinical trials of cellular therapy products., Baseline to Day 30|Phase I - Severe acute adverse events following infusion of EAGD T-cells, Safety of the infusion will be based on the risk of treatment-related severe adverse events as identified in the National Cancer Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4., Baseline to Day 100|Expansion phase - Rate of acute GVHD, Monitoring for GVHD is assessed with Grade II-IV adverse events as identified by the National Cancer Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4., Baseline to Day 100
Expansion phase - Relapse following haploidentical HCT and PTCy with EAGD T-cell infusion, Number of subjects who have acute GVHD by day 100 post-HCT after infusion of EAGD T-cells, Baseline to 100 days|Expansion phase - Non-relapse mortality following haploidentical HCT and PTCy with EAGD T-cell infusion, Number of subjects who have no relapse by day 100 post-HCT after infusion, Baseline to 100 days|Expansion phase - Overall survival following haploidentical HCT and PTCy with EAGD T-cell infusion, Number of subjects who are living by day 100 post-HCT after infusion, Baseline to 100 days|Rate of one-year relapse-free survival (RFS), Number of subjects living without relapse of disease after one year following HCT, Baseline to one year|Rate of one-year non-relapse mortality (NRM), Number of subjects no longer living but not from disease relapse after one year following HCT, Baseline to one year|Rate of one-year overall survival (OS), Number of subjects living after one year following HCT, Baseline to one year|Proportion of subjects with chronic GVHD at one year, Number of subjects with chronic GVHD after one year following HCT, Baseline to one year
Many patients with hematological malignancies require a bone marrow transplant for curative treatment. A matched sibling donor is optimal but may not be available. Therefore, a partially matched family member (haploidentical) may be a viable alternative. The incidence of graft vs. host disease, however, can become more of a significant, even fatal, factor with partial matches.

T-cells have been shown to be the key player in the post-transplant immune phenomena. The majority of T-cells are composed of alpha beta T-cells with a small minority of gamma delta T-cells, which are known to have the unique ability to kill malignant cells without antigen recognition.

This study proposes to extract, concentrate, and activate gamma delta T-cells from the peripheral blood to provide innate anti-tumor effect with minimal risk of GVHD. Safety and impact and/or the rate of GVHD will be evaluated.
