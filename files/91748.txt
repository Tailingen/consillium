Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Abivertinib Maleate Capsules|DRUG: Placebo Gefitinib Tablets|DRUG: Gefitinib Tablets|DRUG: Placebo Abivertinib Maleate Capsules
Assess the efficacy of Abivertinib: Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) of Abivertinib maleate alone versus standard first-line EGFR-TKI for the treatment of treatment-naïve patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer with sensitive EGFR mutation (Investigator's evaluation according to RECIST1.1 criteria), From baseline, then every 6 weeks, until disease progression or discontinuation from study. From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 12 months
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective Response Rate (ORR) of Abivertinib maleate alone versus standard first-line EGFR-TKI for the treatment of treatment-naïve patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer with sensitive EGFR mutation, At baseline and every 6 weeks until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause ( approximately 12 months)|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Disease Control Rate (DCR) of Abivertinib maleate alone versus standard first-line EGFR-TKI for the treatment of treatment-naïve patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer with sensitive EGFR mutation, At baseline and every 6 weeks until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause ( approximately 12 months)|Duration of Response (DoR), Duration of Response (DoR) of Abivertinib maleate alone versus standard first-line EGFR-TKI for the treatment of treatment-naïve patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer with sensitive EGFR mutation, At baseline and every 6 weeks until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause ( approximately 12 months)|Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS) of Abivertinib maleate alone versus standard first-line EGFR-TKI for the treatment of treatment-naïve patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer with sensitive EGFR mutation, From first dose to end of study or date of death from any cause, whichever comes first, assessed every 6 weeks (approximately 36 months)|Safety and Resistance: Number and severity of AEs/SAEs, Number and severity of AEs/SAEs of Abivertinib maleate alone versus standard first-line EGFR-TKI for the treatment of treatment-naïve patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer with sensitive EGFR mutation, From screening to the end of survival follow-up, which is assessed through study completion until 30 days after discontinuation|Safety and Resistance: Drug exposure, The mean, standard deviation, maximum, minimum, and median of drug exposures in the two groups are described, Continuously throughout the study until 30days after discontinuation|Safety and Resistance: General physical examination status, A general physical examination includes: general status, skin, head and neck (includes: eyes, ears, nose, throat), respiratory system, cardiovascular system, abdomen,superficial lymph nodes, thyroid, musculoskeletal system (including spine and limbs), and nervous system, and any other physical signs of clinical significance. During the treatment, physical examination of the potentially affected organs will be performed., Continuously throughout the study until 30days after discontinuation|Safety and Resistance: Electrocardiogram(ECG test), Descriptive statistical analysis of clinical diagnosis results of ECG examination and changes compared with baseline are performed at planned time points, and abnormal ECG examination results are listed., Continuously throughout the study until 30days after discontinuation|Safety and Resistance: Eastern Clinical Oncology Group Scores, ECOG (Eastern Clinical Oncology Group) Performance Status Grading Criteria: Range from 0-5, 0 considered to be the best outcome and 5 to be the worst outcome, Continuously throughout the study until 30days after discontinuation|Questionnaire: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL), Quality of life questionnaire of Abivertinib maleate alone versus standard which includes 5 functional domains, 3 symptom domains, 1 overall health status/quality of life domain and 6 single entries. Standardized scores of the domains/single entries in the questionnaire are used to statistically describe the absolute values and changes from baseline at each evaluation time point; t test is used to compare changes from baseline in overall quality of life score at each evaluation time point in both groups; analysis of variance is used to compare changes in overall health status score at each evaluation time point between the two groups. first-line EGFR-TKI for the treatment of treatment-naïve patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer with sensitive EGFR mutation, At baseline and every 6 weeks until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause ( approximately 12 months)
This is a randomized controlled, double-blind, multicenter, phase III clinical study to compare efficacy and safety of Abivertinib maleate versus first-line standard therapy EGFR-TKI for the treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer with sensitive EGFR mutation
