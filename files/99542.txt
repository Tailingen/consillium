Autologous Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes in Patients With Pretreated Metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer
This study will investigate the safety and efficacy of TIL therapy in patients with metastatic TNBC who have progressed on at least one and no more than three prior systemic anticancer therapies.
Metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer
DRUG: Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) LN-145
Objective Response Rate (ORR), To evaluate the efficacy of autologous LN-145 as a single therapy in Metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) patients by determining the objective response rate (ORR), using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, as assessed by the Investigator. Upon results entry, the time frame was updated to reflect the latest time point that a participant was assessed for ORR in the study., Up to 4 months|Safety Profile, To characterize the safety profile of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) as a single therapy in Metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer patients as measured by the incidence of Grade ≥ 3 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Incidence is presented as a count of participants that experienced at least 1 TEAE of Grade ≥ 3., Up to 3 years
Duration of Response (DOR) in Days, To evaluate the efficacy of autologous LN-145 as a single therapy in Metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer patients in participants that have a clinical response (either partial response (PR) or complete response (CR)) using duration of response (DOR), using RECIST 1.1, as assessed by the Investigator will be used., Up to 3 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR), To evaluate the efficacy of autologous LN-145 as a single therapy in Metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer patients using disease control rate (DCR), using RECIST 1.1, as assessed by the Investigator will be used. Percentage of patients whose disease shrinks or remains stable over a certain time period., Up to 3 years|Progression-free Survival (PFS), To evaluate the efficacy of autologous LN-145 as a single therapy in Metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer patients, median progression-free survival (PFS) days, using RECIST 1.1, as assessed by the Investigator will be used., Up to 3 years|Overall Survival (OS), To evaluate the efficacy of autologous LN-145 as a single therapy in Metastatic Triple Negative Breast patients overall survival (OS) median days will be used., Up to 3 years|Complete Response (CR), To evaluate the efficacy of autologous LN-145 as a single therapy in Metastatic Triple Negative Breast patients complete response, using RECIST 1.1, as assessed by the Investigator will be used. The number of participants with a complete response., Up to 3 years
The primary aims of the study are:

* To evaluate the efficacy of autologous LN-145 as a single therapy in Metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) patients by determining the objective response rate (ORR), using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, as assessed by the Investigator.
* To characterize the safety profile of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) as a single therapy in Metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer patients as measured by the incidence of Grade ≥ 3 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs).

The secondary aims of the study are:

• To further evaluate the efficacy of autologous LN-145 as a single therapy in Metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer patients using complete response duration of response (DOR), disease control rate (DCR), and progression-free survival (PFS), using RECIST 1.1, as assessed by the Investigator, overall survival (OS) and (CR) rate.
