Combination of Toripalimab and Chemoradiotherapy in Esophageal Cancer
Definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is the standard treatment option for unresectable esophageal cancer (EC). However, as high as more than 40% of EC patients experienced locoregional recurrence after concurrent CRT. Immunotherapy targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoints has demonstrated promising activity in advanced EC. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of toripalimab (an anti-PD-1 antibody) combined with definitive CRT in locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).
Unresectable Esophageal Cancer
DRUG: Toripalimab|DRUG: Paclitaxel/Cisplatin|RADIATION: Intensity-modulated radiotherapy
clinical complete response rate, Tumor response was evaluated 3 months after the completion of chemoradiotherapy based on CT or PET-CT scans, endoscopy with biopsies., 3 months after chemoradiotherapy (plus or minus 14 days)
2-year overall survival, The 2-year overall survival of the whole group, From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause or the date of last follow-up, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months|2-year progression-free survival, The 2-year progression-free survival of the whole group, From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause or the date of first documented disease progression whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months|Duration of response, Tumor response was evaluated every two months after chemoradiotherapy according to RECIST criteria, From date of first CR/PR to the date of first PD according to RECIST criteria, assessed up to 24 months|Incidence of treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, Toxicity of treatment was evaluated according to CTCAE 4.0, From the start of treatment to 2 year after the completion of treatment
The impact of PD-L1 expression on clinical response, To investigate the impact of programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on clinical response, Baseline biopsies of primary tumor in esophagus|The impact of IDO1 expression on clinical response, To investigate the impact of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) expression on clinical response, Baseline biopsies of primary tumor in esophagus
