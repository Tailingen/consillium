Avelumab, Utomilumab, Anti-OX40 Antibody PF-04518600, and Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Advanced Malignancies
This phase I/II trial studies the side effects of avelumab when given in different combinations with utomilumab, anti-OX40 antibody PF-04518600, and radiation therapy in treating patients with malignancies that have spread to other places in the body (advanced). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as avelumab, utomilumab, and anti-OX40 antibody PF-04518600, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Radiation therapy uses high-energy rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. It is not yet known how well avelumab works in combination with these other anti-cancer therapies in patients with advanced malignancies.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. For Arm D, to establish the safety, tolerability, and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of different treatment combinations of avelumab when administered in combination with a checkpoint agonist with radiation in patients with metastatic solid tumors in order to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and select the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).

II. To correlate pre- and post-treatment CD8 expression with clinical benefit (complete response \[CR\], partial response \[PR\], or stable disease \[SD\] for \> 6 months).

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate the efficacy of the different treatment combinations in patients with metastatic solid tumors by assessing objective response rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 and immune-related RECIST (irRECIST).

II. To evaluate the efficacy of the different treatment combinations in patients with metastatic solid tumors by assessing progression-free survival (PFS), duration of response (DOR), and overall survival (OS).

EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

I. To understand the mechanism of action of the avelumab plus an immune modulator combination, as well as potential mechanisms of resistance.

II. To characterize the effect of avelumab combinations on immune biomarkers in peripheral blood and tumor tissue obtained from subjects pre- and post-treatment.

III. To compare the response in irradiated versus non-irradiated lesions in Arm D.

IV. To investigate immune biomarkers that are potentially predictive of response and resistance with the combination of avelumab and an immune modulator.

OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 6 arms.

ARM A: Patients receive utomilumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1 of each cycle and avelumab IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15 beginning day 15 of cycle 1. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

ARM B: Patients receive anti-OX40 agonist monoclonal antibody PF-04518600 IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15 of each cycle and avelumab IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15 beginning day 15 of cycle 1. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

ARM C: Patients receive anti-OX40 agonist monoclonal antibody PF-04518600 IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15 of each cycle, utomilumab over 60 minutes on day 1, and avelumab IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15 beginning day 15 of cycle 1. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

ARM D: Patients undergo radiation therapy on days -5 to -1. Patients receive avelumab IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15 of beginning day 15 of cycle 1 and utomilumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

ARM E: DISCONTINUED AS OF AMENDMENT 9 (02/11/2020) Patients undergo radiation therapy on days -14 to -1. Patients receive avelumab IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15 beginning day 15 of cycle 1 and anti-OX40 agonist monoclonal antibody PF-04518600 IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15, and. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

ARM F: DISCONTINUED AS OF AMENDMENT 9 (02/11/2020) Patients undergo radiation therapy on days -14 to -1. Patients receive avelumab IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15 beginning day 15 of cycle 1, utomilumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1, and anti-OX40 agonist monoclonal antibody PF-04518600 IV on days 1 and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients will be followed up at 30 days and then every 12 weeks.
