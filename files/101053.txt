A Global Study to Assess the Effects of Durvalumab + Domvanalimab Following Concurrent Chemoradiation in Participants With Stage III Unresectable NSCLC
This is a Phase III, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, international study assessing the efficacy and safety of durvalumab (MEDI4736) and domvanalimab (AB154) compared with durvalumab plus placebo in adults with locally advanced (Stage III), unresectable NSCLC whose disease has not progressed following definitive platinum-based cCRT.
