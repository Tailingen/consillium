Lifestyle, Exercise, and Nutrition Study Early After Diagnosis
The proposed study is a randomized trial evaluating the impact of a dietary and physical activity guidelines intervention vs. usual care on adherence to breast cancer treatments, body composition, and changes in biomarkers in 172 women newly diagnosed with breast cancer scheduled to receive neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy.
Breast Neoplasms
BEHAVIORAL: Dietary/Physical Activity intervention|BEHAVIORAL: Usual Care
Adherence to Treatment Measured by Chemotherapy Completion Rate, Chemotherapy completion rate will be assessed (via medical records) as the average relative dose-intensity (RDI) for the originally planned regimen based on standard formulas. RDI is calculated by dividing the participant's actual dose by the planned dose to get a percentage of actual dose/planned dose., before initiating chemotherapy to post-chemotherapy, up to 7 months|Adherence to Endocrine Therapy in Women Taking Tamoxifen or Aromatase Inhibitors (AIs), This outcome was updated when results were entered. COVID restrictions prevented the intended method of assessment using urine collection. In its place are the responses on 3 questions regarding adherence.

1. In the past month, how often did you take your aromatase inhibitor (AI)/tamoxifen pills as the doctor prescribed? ('All the time' responses counted)
2. In the past month, how often did you forget to take one or more of your aromatase inhibitor (AI)/tamoxifen pills? ('Never' responses counted)
3. In the past month, how often did you decide to skip one or more of your aromatase inhibitor (AI)/tamoxifen pills? ('Never' responses counted), 12 months after enrollment|Adherence to Endocrine Therapy in Women Taking Tamoxifen or Aromatase Inhibitors (AIs)., This outcome was updated when results were entered.

Currently the Department of Health and Human Services, the American Cancer Society and others provide diet and exercise guidelines for cancer survivors. Many women with breast cancer do not follow these guidelines, and also elect to delay concerted efforts toward following them until active treatment is complete. However, adoption of these recommended lifestyle behaviors soon after diagnosis may prevent adverse changes in body composition and breast cancer biomarkers and may even improve the efficacy of treatment resulting in improved breast cancer prognosis. Further, by increasing our understanding of the mechanisms mediating the association between lifestyle behaviors and breast cancer survival, this study will improve our knowledge of how changes in diet and physical activity influence breast cancer outcomes. Lastly, guidelines for breast cancer survivors also overlap with those for diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention, the latter being a common cause of breast cancer mortality.

The proposed study will examine, in 172 women newly diagnosed with Stage I-III breast cancer who are not practicing the dietary and lifestyle guidelines, and who are scheduled to receive neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy, the effect of a 1-year dietary and physical activity guidelines intervention vs. usual care on the following breast cancer outcomes measured before beginning chemotherapy (Time 0), post chemotherapy (Time 1), at one-year post-diagnosis (Time 2), at two years post-diagnosis (Time 3), and at five-years post-diagnosis (Time 4): adherence to treatment, and changes in biomarkers, body composition, diet, physical activity and quality of life.
