Nab-Paclitaxel as Salvage Treatment in Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer
The investigators propose to study the efficacy and safety of nab-Paclitaxel in a Phase II trial of patients with locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinomas of the stomach and gastro-esophageal junction
Stomach and Gastro-Esophageal Junction (GEJ) Cancer
DRUG: nab-Paclitaxel
Overall Response Rate, Documented response rate will be assessed every two months (8 weeks) until disease progression according to common criteria for tumor response, Disease evaluation every 8 weeks up to 108 weeks
Disease control rate, Documented disease control rate will be assessed every two months (8 weeks) until disease progression according to common criteria for tumor response, Disease evaluation every 8 weeks up to 108 weeks|Progression Free Survival, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever come first, assessed up to 108 weeks, Up to 108 weeks|Overall Survival, From date of randomization until the date of last follow up or death from any cause, assessed up to 108 weeks, Up to 108 weeks|Number of Participants with Adverse Events, Every two weeks up to 24 weeks
Adenocarcinomas of the stomach or gastrointestinal junction refractory/resistant to 1st line chemotherapy are considered as an orphan disease with limited (if any) treatment options. The promising results of Nab-Paclitaxel derived from preclinical studies and from clinical trials conducted in breast cancer patients open the field to develop such therapeutic approaches in other cancers types usually treated with taxanes such as gastric and GEJ adenocarcinomas. We design a phase II study in order to evaluate the effect of nab-Paclitaxel as salvage treatment for patients with advanced cancer of the stomach and GEJ previously treated with the DCF regimen.
