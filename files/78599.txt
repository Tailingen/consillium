A Phase II Trial of Cabozantinib With Patients With Refractory GCTs
The purpose of the CTO-IUSCCC-0752 study is to investigate the use of Cabozantinib for patients with incurable, refractory germ cell tumors. Patients will be treated until evidence of disease progression, non-compliance with study protocol, unacceptable major toxicity, at subject's own request for withdrawal, or if the study closes for any reason.

DRUG: Cabozantinib
Clinical benefit rate, determined by the proportion of complete responses, partial responses, and stable disease for at least 3 months of therapy using RECIST 1.1 while including markers AFP/ beta-hcg., up to 1 year
Objective response rate, Defined by proportion of complete response and partial response using RECIST 1.1 or tumor markers., up to 1 year|Overall survival, Measured by start of the treatment until time of death or last follow up visit., Start of the treatment until time of death or last follow up visit (up to 2 years)|Incidence of Adverse Events, Toxicity measured by the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0 and need for treatment delay, dose reduction, or early discontinuation., Start of treatment until end of treatment safety assessments (up to 1 year)|Progression free survival, The start of the treatment until death or criteria for disease progression are met.
