PET/CT Scan as a Tool to Rationalize the Treatment of Patients With Advanced ColoRectal Cancer Undergoing First-line Medical Treatment
The purpose of this study is to test whether an early metabolic response, measured by PET/CT scan after the first cycle of chemotherapy, is able to predict which patients with advanced CRC have a better prognosis.
Colorectal Cancer Stage IV
PROCEDURE: PET/CT|DRUG: first-line chemotherapy
change from baseline in highest value SUVmax (maximum standardized uptake values in PET/CT scan), To validate as prognostic factor, in terms of overall survival,early metabolic response, defined as a reduction of more than 50% of the highest value of SUVmax recorded at PET/CT scan after one cycle of chemotherapy, compared to the highest value of SUVmax recorded baseline examination, 2 weeks
Change from baseline in SUVmaxsum, TLGmax and TLGmaxsum, to describe and validate early metabolic response as a prognostic factor (in terms of progression free survival), using the sum of the SUVmax (SUVmaxsum) , the highest value of TLG (TLGmax), the sum of TLG ( TLGmaxsum)., one year|correlation among SUVmax, SUVmaxsum, TLGmax, TLGsum with progression-free survival after first-line pharmacologic therapy, prognostic role of early metabolic response (defined according the above reported 4 parameters) in terms of progression free survival after a first line pharmacologic therapy, one year|correlation among SUVmax, SUVmaxsum, TLGmax, TLGsum with objective response, To describe the association between early metabolic response (defined according the above reported 4 parameters) and objective response according RECIST criteria, measured after 3 cycles of chemotherapy, 3 months|prognostic value of metabolic response (SUVmax, SUVmaxsum, TLGmax, TLGsum) and recist response, one year
prognostic value of metabolic response (SUVmax, SUVmaxsum, TLGmax, TLGsum) by different cut off values (other than 50% reduction), one year
The purpose of this study is to test whether an early metabolic response, measured by PET/CT scan after the first cycle of chemotherapy, is able to predict which patients with advanced CRC have a better prognosis.
