A Study to Evaluate eFT508 Alone and in Combination With Avelumab in Subjects With MSS Colorectal Cancer
This is a Phase 2, open-label, 2-part, multicenter study in subjects with MSS relapsed/refractory colorectal cancer. The primary objective of Part 1 is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of eFT508 in combination with a fixed dose of avelumab to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of eFT508 and to select a recommended dose for Part 2. The primary objective of Part 2 is to evaluate antitumor activity of eFT508 at the recommended dose in combination with avelumab or eFT508 monotherapy. Parts 1 and 2 will also evaluate pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics.
