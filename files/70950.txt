A Study of AP402 in HER2-Positive Patients With Locally or Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1/2, multi-regional, multi-center, open-label, first-in-human (FIH), dose-escalation and dose expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and preliminary clinical activity of AP402 in HER2-positive patients with locally or advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: AP402 (Part 1 Dose esclation)|DRUG: AP402 (Part 2 Dose Expansion)
Estimate of Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), This will be based on dose limiting toxicities (DLT) observed during the DLT evaluation period., Baseline to 90 days after the last dose|Number of participants with Adverse events (AEs) and Serious Adverse events (SAE) as assessed by CTCAE V5, Baseline to 90 days after the last dose|To evaluate R2PD based on PK parameters- Cmax (Maximum plasma concentration), Baseline to 90 days after the last dose|To evaluate R2PD based on PK parameters- Tmax (time for maximum concentration), Baseline to 90 days after the last dose|To evaluate R2PD based on PK parameters- AUC (Area under curve), Baseline to 90 days after the last dose|To evaluate R2PD based on PK parameters- T1/2 (terminal half-life), Baseline to 90 days after the last dose
To evaluate objective response rate (ORR), The proportion of patients whose best overall response (BOR) is either confirmed complete responses (CR) or confirmed partial responses (PR)., Baseline to 30 days after the last dose|Number of patients with disease Control Rate (DCR), The proportion of patients whose best overall response of confirmed CR, confirmed PR, or (confirmed) stable disease (SD) that was assessed at least 4 weeks (28 days) following the initiation of AP402, Baseline to 90 days after the last dose|Number of patients with changes in duration of objective response (DOOR), The time from first documented objective response (confirmed CR or confirmed PR) until the earlier of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Baseline to 30 days after the last dose|Duration of disease control response (DODC):, The time from first documented disease control response (confirmed CR, confirmed PR, or confirmed SD) until the earlier of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. This will only be applicable for patients who have a confirmed best overall response of CR, PR, or SD. Patients without the events (progressive disease or death) will be censored at the date of their last tumor assessment., Baseline to 30 days after the last dose|To assess progression-free survival (PFS):, The time from start of study treatment to the earlier of either disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 48 months|To assess overall Survival (OS), The time from start of study treatment to the date of death from any cause. Patients alive will be censored at the date of last known alive., Up to 48 months|To assess time to Objective Response (TTOR):, The time from start of study treatment to the first documented objective response (confirmed CR or confirmed PR), whichever occurs first., Baseline to 30 days after the last dose|To assess time to disease control response (TTDC):, The time from start of study treatment to the first documented disease control response (confirmed CR, confirmed PR, or confirmed SD (at least 4 weeks (28 days) following the initiation of AP402)), whichever occurs first., Baseline to 30 days after the last dose|Serum concentration of AP402, Baseline to 30 days after the last dose|To evaluate immunogenicity by the number and percentage of patients who develop ADA, Baseline to 30 days after the last dose|To evaluate immunogenicity by the number and percentage of patients who develop neutralizing antibodies (if applicable)., Baseline to 30 days after the last dose
The study will consist of 2 parts:

* Part 1 (Dose Escalation): Dose escalation will consist of 7 cohorts where an IV infusion of AP402 will be administered once every 2 weeks to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) (ie, the highest safe dose administered to patients) and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of AP402. For dose-escalation, an accelerated dose titration design will be utilized for the first 2 dose cohorts, followed by a standard 3+3 dose titration design for the remaining 5 cohorts. Up to 42 patients will be enrolled in Part 1.
* Part 2 (Dose Expansion): After the MTD and/or RP2D are determined by the Safety Review Committee (SRC) (see Section 6.5), additional patients will be enrolled in Part 2 and will be treated with AP402 at that dose once every 2 weeks. Part 2 will be based on the Simon's two-stage optimal design (Simon, 1989) and is expected to enroll approximately 43 patients in 1 or 2 selected tumor types.

Administration of the IP will continue for 12 months or until confirmed progressive disease, initiation of alternative cancer therapy, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, study completion, death or other reasons leading to treatment discontinuation, whichever comes first
