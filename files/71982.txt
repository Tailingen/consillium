Improving Response to Immunotherapy in Patients With Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Chronic Hepatitis C Virus Infection With Direct-Acting Antiviral Therapy
To learn if giving immune checkpoint therapy (such as atezolizumab) and bevacizumab to patients who have HCC and are receiving DAAs may help to control HCC and hepatitis C.
Liver Cancer
DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Atezolizumab|DRUG: Sofosbuvir|DRUG: Velpatasvir|DRUG: Voxilaprevir|DRUG: Ribavirin
Overall Response Rate, Stable Disease in 2 out of 2 patients, 9 months|Sustained Virologic Response (SVR), SVR 12 in 2 out of 2 patients, 9 months
Primary Objective(s):

* Estimate the objective response rate (ORR) to ICT and estimate the sustained virologic response (SVR) in patients with HCC and chronic HCV infection using HCV clearance with DAA therapy.
* Estimate the change of the overall T cells and virus-specific T cells before and after the antiviral treatment in patients with HCC and chronic HCV infection using HCV clearance with DAA therapy.

Secondary objective:

--Collect the safety profile of the treatment and estimate the time-to-event variable such as overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS).
