Palliative Radiotherapy to Dominant Symptomatic Lesion in Patients With Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer
The aim of the present feasibility study of a new short palliative radiotherapy regime that apply to patients with metastatic hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) presenting with a dominating debilitating symptom. Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) will apply to identify both the lesion and the most aggressive part of the lesion. The symptomatic lesions will be treated with a dose of 4 x 5 Gy, while for the most aggressive part of the lesion the dose will be escalated to 4 x 7 Gy using a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) technique.
