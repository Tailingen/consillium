ORR (Overall response rate), defined as the number of participants with measurable disease at baseline who have a confirmed Complete Response or confirmed Partial Response according to RECIST Version 1.1., From baseline to end of treatment (up to Week 24)
Overall summary of TEAEs including number and percentage of participants with at least one TEAE. TEAEs will be summarized by System Organ Class and Preferred Term. TEAEs will be summarized by severity and causality., From enrollment up to week 24|Change in maximum tumor diameter and volume summarized as the largest or the smallest percentage change from baseline. Independent central image review based on RECIST 1.1 criteria will be the primary analysis., From baseline up to week 24|Median OS and proportion of participants alive at 6 months., from baseline to week 24|The proportion of participants becoming eligible for resection as determined by local multidisciplinary team review, from baseline to week 24
Patients with Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer who have not received prior treatment to their pancreatic cancer will receive ACT treatment (the drug PS101 and ultrasound application to the tumor) with up to eight 2-week cycles of modified FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy.

ACT treatment will be given on Day 1 of each cycle of chemotherapy. Patients' well-being and side effects will be assessed at the same visits. The objective efficacy of the treatment will be assessed by CT scans every 8 weeks.
