Prevention of the Hepatic Sinusoidal Obstruction Syndrome by Means of Anticoagulants
The purpose of the study is to determine whether anticoagulant use (i.e. salicylates, clopidogrel, low-molecular weight heparin, or coumarin derivates) is able to prevent the development of the sinusoidal obstruction syndrome secondary to oxaliplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients suffering from colorectal liver metastases.

Histologically proven hepatic sinusoidal injury, during liver surgery
90-day morbidity and mortality, up until 90 days after surgery
Surgical resection remains the only curative treatment for patients suffering from colorectal liver metastases, but only 15-25% of patients are initially eligible for resection. The majority of patients suffering from colorectal liver metastases receives chemotherapy prior to liver surgery in order to downsize the colorectal liver metastases. Preoperative treatment with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy is related to sinusoidal injury, the so-called sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. Patients with histologically proven sinusoidal injury undergoing liver surgery have a higher risk of post-resectional morbidity. Damage to the hepatic sinusoids is a key factor for the development of the sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. Anticoagulants (i.e. salicylates, clopidogrel, low-molecular weight heparin, or coumarin derivates) might be able to prevent this damage and, consequently, the development of the sinusoidal obstruction syndrome in patients suffering from colorectal liver metastases treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
