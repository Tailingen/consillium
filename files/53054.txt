Evaluation of Low-Level Laser Therapy Efficacy in Pain Management of Grade 2 Oral Mucositis Induced by Radiotherapy or Chemoradiotherapy: a Study in Patients With Upper Aerodigestive Tract Cancer
Prospective, monocentric, randomized phase II study evaluating Low-Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) as a treatment for the pain due to grade 2 oral mucositis in patients with upper aero-digestive tract cancer treated by radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy.

Patients with upper aero-digestive tract cancer receiving their first cervicofacial radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy will be included in this study if they suffer from oral mucositis due to their treatment.

The study procedure will consist in 5 applications of the LLLT that will be performed at three days intervals for a maximum duration of 15 days.

Each patient will be followed until 3 days after the end of the study treatment, for a total duration of the study of 18 days.
