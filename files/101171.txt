A Phase II Trial to Explore Niraparib and Anlotinib Maintenance Retreatment in Platinum-Sensitive Recurrent Ovarian Cancer Patients Previously Treated With PARPi
This study will be an open-label, single-arm, prospective, exploratory phase II trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of niraparib maintenance retreatment in platinum- sensitive recurrent (PSR) epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients (including patients with primary peritoneal and/or fallopian tube cancer).
Epithelial Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: Niraparib
Progression free survival (PFS), PFS is assessed as the time from niraparib treatment initiation to the earlier date of assessment of progression, as assessed by RECIST v1.1 criteria based on Investigator assessment, or death by any cause in the absence of progression, Up to 1 year
Progression Free Survival (PFS) Rate at 6 months, PFS rate at 6 months is defined as the proportion of participants who have not progressed or died within 6 months after niraparib treatment initiation. Progression will be assessed by RECIST v1.1 criteria per investigator assessmentï¼‰, 6 months|Time to First Subsequent Therapy (TFST), TFST is defined as the date of initiation of niraparib treatment in the current study to the start date of the first subsequent anticancer therapy., The date of initiation of niraparib treatment in the current study to the start date of the first subsequent anticancer therapy assessed up to 15 months.|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the date of initiation of niraparib treatment to the date of death by any cause., From the time of enrollment to date of death by any cause assessed up to 36 months.|Frequency and severity of adverse effects as defined by CTCAE version 5.0, Number of patients with any non-serious adverse event (non-SAE) or any SAE to evaluate the safety and tolerability of niraparib combined with anlotinib., From the time of enrollment to date of 30 days after the last study drug administration.
This study will investigate the efficacy and safety of niraparib maintenance re-treatment in patients with PSR non-mucinous EOC, who have previously received maintenance therapy with a Polyadenosine 5'diphosphoribose \[poly (ADP ribose)\] polymerisation inhibitor (PARPi) and a complete or partial radiological response to subsequent treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy or may have no evidence of disease (if optimal cytoreductive surgery was conducted prior to chemotherapy). Patients will be enrolled, given niraparib and anlotinib maintenance treatment until disease progression or untolerated toxicity.
