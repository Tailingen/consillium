Prevention for the Development of Liver Tumorigenesis by the Oral Supplementation of Branched-chain Amino Acids
The long-term outcomes of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) administration in patients undergoing hepatic resection remain unclear. The aim of this study is to assess the impact of oral supplementation with BCAA on the prevention for the development of liver tumorigenesis in patients undergoing liver resection.
Liver Cancer
DRUG: LIVACT
Postoperative tumor recurrence rate, 5 years follow up
nutritional status, The secondary endpoint was a comparison of measurements of body weight, arm muscle circumference (AMC) between patient groups., 5 years follow up
This study might demonstrate a tendency of the improvement in the cumulative tumor recurrence rate after hepatectomy for liver neoplasm in the Livact group compared to that in the Control Group. The investigators believe that BCAA seems to be a remarkable benefit for liver resection, especially on its reduction in the recurrence of liver cancer. This treatment regimen has potential to offer benefits for clinical use selectively, especially for patients with chronic liver diseases.
