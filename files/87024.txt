A Phase II Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of Pembrolizumab in Combination With Chemotherapy as Neoadjuvant Therapy for Triple-negative Breast Cancer
A Phase II study that evaluating the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy as neoadjuvant therapy for triple-negative breast cancer in the Chinese population
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Epirubicin|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide
Pathological complete response (pCR) rate using the definition of ypT0/Tis ypN0 (i.e., no invasive residual in breast or nodes; noninvasive breast residuals allowed) at the time of definitive surgery, pCR rate (ypT0/Tis ypN0) is defined as the percentage of participants without residual invasive cancer on hematoxylin and eosin evaluation of the complete resected breast specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes following completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy by current American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging criteria assessed by the local pathologist at the time of definitive surgery., Up to approximately 27-30 weeks
Event-free Survival (EFS) as assessed by Investigator, EFS is defined as the time from randomization to any of the following events: progression of disease that precludes surgery, local or distant recurrence, second primary malignancy (breast or other cancers) or death due to any cause, Up to approximately 8 years|Percentage of participants who experience an adverse event (AE), An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered study treatment which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study treatment or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to study treatment or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of study treatment, is also an AE, Up to approximately 52 weeks
