Bortezomib in Treating Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer
RATIONALE: Bortezomib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well bortezomib works in treating patients with metastatic kidney cancer.
Kidney Cancer
DRUG: bortezomib
Objective Response Rate as Measured by RECIST Criteria After Every 2 Courses of Treatment for up to 6 Courses, 2 months
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine, preliminarily, the efficacy of bortezomib in patients with metastatic non-clear cell renal cell carcinoma in terms of objective response rate after a minimum of 2 courses of treatment.

Secondary

* Correlate clinical response in these patients with baseline von Hippel-Lindau expression and nuclear factor-KB activity.

OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 month and then periodically for 2 years.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27 patients will be accrued for this study.
