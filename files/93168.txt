Study of Olomorasib (LY3537982) in Combination With Standard of Care in Participants With Resected or Unresectable KRAS G12C-mutant Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
The main purpose of this study is to assess if olomorasib in combination with pembrolizumab is more effective than the pembrolizumab and placebo combination in part A in participants with resected KRAS G12C-mutant NSCLC and to assess if olomorasib in combination with durvalumab is more effective than the durvalumab and placebo combination in part B in participants with unresectable KRAS G12C-mutant non-small cell lung cancer. The study may last up to 3 years for each participant.

DRUG: Olomorasib|DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Durvalumab|DRUG: Placebo
Part A: Disease-Free Survival (DFS) by Investigator Assessment, DFS by Investigator Assessment, Randomization to disease recurrence or death from any cause (Estimated as approximately 48 months).|Part B: Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 by blinded independent central review (BICR), Randomization to disease progression or death from any cause (Estimated as approximately 3 years).
Part A & B: Overall Survival (OS), OS, Randomization to disease progression or death from any cause (Estimated as approximately 5 years).|Part A & B: Change from baseline in health-related quality of life (HRQoL), measured by European Organization for Research & Treatment of CancerQualityofLifeQuestionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), Change from baseline in HRQoL, measured by the EORTC QLQ-C30, Randomization through end of treatment (Estimated as approximately 3 years).|Part B: Objective Response Rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1 by BICR, ORR per RECIST 1.1 by BICR, Randomization to disease progression or death from any cause (Estimated as approximately 3 years).|Part B: Duration of Response (DOR) per RECIST 1.1 by BICR, DOR per RECIST 1.1 by BICR, Randomization to disease progression or death from any cause (Estimated as approximately 3 years).|Part B: Disease Control Rate (DCR) per RECIST 1.1 by BICR, DCR per RECIST 1.1 by BICR, Randomization to disease progression or death from any cause (Estimated as approximately 3 years).|Part B: Time to Response (TTR) per RECIST 1.1 by BICR, TTR per RECIST 1.1 by BICR, Randomization until the date that measurement criteria for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) are first met (Estimated as approximately 3 years).|Part B: Progression-Free Survival 2 (PFS2) by investigator assessment, PFS2 by investigator assessment, Randomization to disease progression on next line of treatment or death from any cause (Estimated as approximately 3 years).]|Part B: Changes in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)-related symptoms, measured by the NSCLC-Symptom Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ), Changes in NSCLC-related symptoms, measured by the NSCLC-SAQ, Randomization through end of treatment (Estimated as approximately 3 years).|Part B: Time to worsening of NSCLC-related symptoms, as measured by NSCLC-SAQ, Time to worsening of NSCLC-related symptoms, as measured by NSCLC-SAQ, Randomization through end of treatment (Estimated as approximately 3 years).|Part B: Changes in patient-reported pulmonary symptoms of cough, chest pain, and dyspnea, measured by NSCLC-SAQ, Changes in patient-reported pulmonary symptoms of cough, chest pain, and dyspnea, measured by NSCLC-SAQ, Randomization through end of treatment (Estimated as approximately 3 years).
