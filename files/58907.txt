Study of Lenalidomide (Revlimid) in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma (PTCL) Patients
Revlimid is a potent immunomodulatory analogue without the teratogenic effects, which has direct anti-tumor effects, anti-angiogenic and both anti-inflammatory and T-cell costimulatory properties. Both preclinical and clinical data indicate its efficacy solid tumor and multiple myeloma including advanced/refractory stages with its role in enhancing host antitumor immunity that provided the rationale to use in patients with PTCL.
Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Lenalidomide
To assess the feasibility of Revlimid as salvage treatment in PTCL, 12 months
To assess the overall response rate (CR and PR) of PTCL receiving REVLIMID; To assess the Tumor Control Rate (TCR); To assess the duration of response; To assess the quality of life., 12 months
