A Prospective Study of Outcome After Therapy for Acromegaly
The purpose of this study is to evaluate hormone values and other markers of disease activity in a cohort of patients with acromegaly at the time of diagnosis and then prospectively after surgical or other treatment. This study is designed to determine blood levels of growth hormone and related hormones and cardiovascular risk markers as well as signs and symptoms of the disease at diagnosis and how these parameters change over time after surgical or other therapy. The investigators will also obtain hormonal data in a group of 50 healthy subjects who will each be studied just once with an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). These data will provide a comparison group to the acromegaly subjects.
Acromegaly
PROCEDURE: Surgery for acromegaly|DRUG: Medications for acromegaly|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Total body magnetic resonance imaging|PROCEDURE: Adipose Tissue Biopsy
Biochemical activity of Acromegaly, The study will assess the status of biochemical disease activity of acromegaly before and after treatment for acromegaly. Blood samples are taken for fasting growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor 1 and growth hormone levels 60, 90 and 120 minutes after oral glucose taken at baseline visit, post-operative or after the initiation of medical therapy at month 1 (fasting blood only), month 3 (fasting blood only), month 6, month 12, and annual assessments for at least 5 years., At 5 years after therapy for acromegaly

Surgical removal of the pituitary tumor is the usual first form of treatment offered, but this is curative in only approximately 70% of patients. If not adequately treated, the disease can have significant morbidity largely due to the development of hypertension, diabetes and malignancy as well as possible loss of vision or other neurologic complications of a large pituitary mass. Inadequately treated acromegaly is also associated with a mortality rate 2-3 fold over the general population. All the mechanisms responsible for the increased morbidity and mortality in acromegaly as well as what biochemical criteria should be used during treatment in order to normalize the increased morbidity and mortality are not known. This study aims to follow patients with acromegaly prospectively from active disease through treatment in order to identify these factors.
