Pseudohyponatremia of Multiple Myeloma is True Hyponatremia
Hypothesis: the hyponatremia of multiple myeloma (m.m.)is true and not pseudohyponatremia by using the stewart approach to acid - base interpretation, would like to show that the positive charged m- proteins produced in m.m.result in true hyponatremia.
