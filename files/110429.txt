Effects of Therapeutic Touch in Patients With Female Genital Neoplasia: a Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial
This is a randomized controlled prospective study on the use of therapeutic touch in patients diagnosed with gynecological cancer. The patients will be randomized into three groups: control group (will not receive any interventions with therapeutic touch), placebo group (will receive simulated therapeutic touch intervention by individual not knowing this technique) and treatment group(will receive therapeutic touch intervention by a trained therapeutic touch therapist). Two different quality of life questionnaires will be applied (before and after treatment). Levels of cortisol, salivary IgA, hematological indices and telomerase activity before and after the use of therapeutic touch will be compared between groups.

This project is a randomized controlled prospective study on the use of therapeutic touch in patients diagnosed with gynecological cancer. The patients will be randomized into three groups: control group (will not receive any interventions with therapeutic touch), placebo group (will receive simulated therapeutic touch intervention by individual not knowing the practice) and treatment group (will receive therapeutic touch intervention by a trained therapeutic touch therapist). Two different quality of life questionnaires (World Health Organization quality of life questionnaire - WHOQOL-Bref and the quality of life Core-30 questionnaire - EORTC QLQ-C30) from the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer will be applied before and after treatment. Levels of cortisol, salivary IgA, hematological indices and telomerase activity before and after the use of therapeutic touch will be compared between groups.
