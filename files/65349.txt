A Comparative Study Between Laryngeal Mask Airway and Magensium Sulphate in Attenuating Systemic Stress Response During Emergence of Patients Undergoing Supratentorial Tumours.
To evaluate the efficacy of replacement of ETT with LMA and administration of Magnesium sulphate at the end of the surgery in attenuating systemic stress response during emergence of patients undergoing supratentorial tumours
LMA Versus Mgso4 in Attenuating Stress Response During Emergence of Supratentorial Tumours Patients
DEVICE: Laryngeal mask airway|DRUG: Magensium sulphate|OTHER: Control group (closure of anesthetics)
Mean arterial blood presure, Total dose of nitroglycerin needed in each group to maintain mean blood pressure within 20 % of basal line., 5 minutes from closure of anesthetics until 15 minutes after extubation
Intracranial pressure Measurement, Intracranial pressure will be measured at these moments: basal line preinduction, end of surgery, before extubation and 1, 10 minutes after extubation., 1 and 10 minutes after extubation.|Quality of extubation, Qualityof extubation will be evaluated based on cough immediately after extubation, using a five point rating scale, Time Onset of cough immediately after extubation|Level of consciousness, consciousness level will be recorded based on Ramasy score scale at 5 and 15 minutes after extubation, using the following indices, 5 and 15 minutes after extubation|End of surgery and extubation, Time interval between end of surgery and extubation in each group, intraoperative
Rapid recovery from neuroanesthesia and early neurological examination are desirable in most cases.(1)Although, Systemic and cerebral hemodynamic changes caused by extubation and emergence from anesthesia may endanger neurosurgical patients and increase the risk of postoperative intracranial hemorrhage and cerebral edema and may even result in the requirement of reoperation.(2) During this phase, heart rate and arterial blood pressure increase leading to increases in cerebral blood flow and intracranial pressure.(3) Some studies have reported such hemodynamic effects in up to 50% of patients after supratentorial craniotomy.(4,5) Replacing the endotracheal tube (ETT) with laryngeal mask airway (LMA) prior to emergence from anesthesia is safe and effectively reduces the cardiovascular response.(6) The potential protective benefit of this approach has not yet been demonstrated for awakening neurosurgery patients, however.

Magnesium is the forth most abundant cation in the body and the second most abundant intracellular cation. It activates many of the enzyme systems.(7) Magnesium sulphate inhibits catecholamines release from adrenergic nerve terminals and from adrenal medulla, through blocking N-type of Ca-channel at peripheral sympathetic nerve ending so it is used to decrease the adverse cardiovascular effects during larygeoscopy and endotracheal intubation.(8) But its role in attenuating stress response during extubation is not well studied and need more research.
