Control Cohort CTRL COH
Autoimmune encephalitis (AE) and paraneoplastic neurological syndromes (PNS) are rare disease that could be difficult to diagnose. So it necessary to obtain numerous sample from different disease to develop more specific diagnosis kit It could be possible through the characterisation of new genetic biomarkers.
Parkinson's Disease; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Glioblastoma; Cancer Without Neurological Disease; Rheumatoid Polyarthritis
BIOLOGICAL: Collection of biological sample (blood and/or CSF)
Samples (blood dry and EDTA tube and optional cerebro-spinal-fluid), Numbers of samples collected and patients included in the cohort, 15 minutes
Description of genetic analysis, Number of new biomarkers (genetic) and specific HLA (human leucocyte antigen), Data collecting: 3 years Data analysis: 2 years
