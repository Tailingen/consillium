AMG 510 Ethnic Sensitivity Study (CodeBreaK 105).
To evaluate safety, tolerability, PK, and preliminary efficacy of AMG 510 PO QD in subjects of Chinese descent with KRAS p.G12C-mutant advanced/metastatic solid tumors.
Advanced/Metastatic Solid Tumors With KRAS p.G12C Mutation
DRUG: AMG 510
Number of Participants With Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLT), DLTs were defined as any of the following adverse events (AEs) where a relationship to sotorasib could not be ruled out.

Hematological toxicity

* febrile neutropenia
* neutropenic infection
* grade 4 neutropenia
* grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia for \> 7 days
* grade 3 thrombocytopenia with grade ≥ 2 bleeding
* grade 4 thrombocytopenia
* grade 4 anemia.

Non-hematological toxicity

* grade ≥ 4 vomiting or diarrhea
* grade 3 diarrhea or grade 3 vomiting lasting more than 3 days despite optimal medical support
* grade ≥ 3 nausea for 3 days or more despite optimal medical support
* any other grade ≥ 3 adverse event., Day 1 to Day 21|Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs), An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant irrespective of a causal relationship with the study treatment. A TEAE was defined as an AE starting on or after first dose of study treatment.

Treatment-related TEAEs were any TEAEs considered related to investigational product by the investigator. If relationship was missing, the event was assumed treatment-related.

Clinically significant changes from the participant's baseline values in vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiograms, and clinical laboratory safety tests were reported as AEs., Day 1 until the end of study (or primary data cut-off date for ongoing participants); median [min, max] duration was 5.57 [1.5, 13.7] months|Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of Sotorasib, Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were determined from the concentration-time profile using standard non-compartmental approaches and considering the profile over the complete sampling interval., Pre-dose and 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours post-dose on Days 1 and 8|Time to Achieve Cmax (Tmax) of Sotorasib, PK parameters were determined from the concentration-time profile using standard non-compartmental approaches and considering the profile over the complete sampling interval., Pre-dose and 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours post-dose on Days 1 and 8|Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve From Time 0 to 24 Hours (AUC0-24h) of Sotorasib, PK parameters were determined from the concentration-time profile using standard non-compartmental approaches and considering the profile over the complete sampling interval., Pre-dose and 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours post-dose on Days 1 and 8
Objective Response (OR), Measured by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Assessed per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 guidelines., Day 1 until the end of study (approximately 12 months)|Duration of Response (DoR), Measured by CT or MRI. Assessed per RECIST version 1.1 guidelines., Day 1 until the end of study (approximately 12 months)|Progression-free Survival (PFS), Measured by CT or MRI. Assessed per RECIST version 1.1 guidelines., Day 1 until the end of study (approximately 12 months)|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Measured by CT or MRI. Assessed per RECIST version 1.1 guidelines., Day 1 until the end of study (approximately 12 months)|Time to Response (TTR), Measured by CT or MRI. Assessed per RECIST version 1.1 guidelines., Day 1 until the end of study (approximately 12 months)|Duration of Stable Disease, Measured by CT or MRI. Assessed per RECIST version 1.1 guidelines., Day 1 until the end of study (approximately 12 months)
