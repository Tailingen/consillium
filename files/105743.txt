The objective of this randomized controlled trial is to investigate whether home-based psychosocial interventions are able to help families of childhood cancer survivors cope with cancer-related psychological issues.

Method: 300 families will be recruited from the four pediatric oncology departments in Denmark where 150 families' will receive a home-based psychosocial intervention and 150 families will be in the control group. The study will take place shortly after the child completes the primary treatment. The primary outcome is post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in parents and secondary outcomes include among others quality of life, sick-leave, coping strategies and family functioning. Families in the intervention group will receive a 6 session manualized intervention based on a Cognitive Behavioral framework. Four sessions will focus on the parents and two sessions will focus on the child, who had cancer, and his/her siblings. The main goal of the sessions is to teach families how to adapt healthy psychological adjustments to pediatric oncology and prevent PTSS in family members. As a part of the intervention, families will be presented with video clips of other parents discussing how cancer has affected their family, to show common issues in experiencing having a child undergo cancer treatment. Every family member will be asked to complete a set of questionnaires to measure the outcome of the intervention at baseline before the intervention, 6 months follow-up and 12 months follow-up.

It is expected that families in the intervention group experience a larger improvement in their post-traumatic stress symptoms as well as strengthening the family function, quality of life and reducing sick leave compared to the control group.
