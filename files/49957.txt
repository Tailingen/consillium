Drug-drug Interaction Study With AZD5305 and Itraconazole in Patients With Advanced Solid Malignancies
This study is a single-arm, open-label, multi-centre drug-drug interaction (DDI) study of AZD5305 administered orally in patients with advanced solid tumours.

The ratios of geometric means of test intervention (AZD5305 + Itraconazole; parent and metabolite\[s\], if applicable) relative to reference intervention (AZD5305 alone) of AUClast will be presented., Day 1-4, Day 7-13|Part A: Maximum plasma drug concentration (Cmax), The effect of Itraconazole on the Cmax of AZD5305 will be assessed. The ratios of geometric means of test intervention (AZD5305 + Itraconazole; parent and metabolite\[s\], if applicable) relative to reference intervention (AZD5305 alone) of Cmax will be presented., Day 1-4, Day 7-13|Part A: Apparent total body clearance of drug from plasma (CL/F), The effect of Itraconazole on the PK of AZD5305 will be assessed., Day 1-4, Day 7-13|Part A: Terminal elimination half-life (t½λz), The effect of Itraconazole on the PK of AZD5305 will be assessed., Day 1-4, Day 7-13|Part A: Time to maximum observed concentration (Tmax), The effect of Itraconazole on the PK of AZD5305 will be assessed., Day 1-4, Day 7-13|Part A: Apparent volume of distribution based on the terminal phase (Vz/F), The effect of Itraconazole on the PK of AZD5305 will be assessed., Day 1-4, Day 7-13
Part A and Part B: Number of participants with Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse events (SAEs), Participants with potentially clinically significant AEs and SAEs will be determined., Part A: From screening until post-treatment follow-up (28 days after last dose) (approximately 13 days if continuing into Part B); Part B: From Cycle 1 day 1 until Post treatment follow up (28 days after last dose) (approximately 12 months)|Part A and Part B: Number of Participants with Laboratory Value Abnormalities and/or AEs, Participants with potentially clinically significant laboratory values will be determined., Part A: From screening until post-treatment follow-up (28 days after last dose) (approximately 13 days if continuing into Part B); Part B: From Cycle 1 Day 1 until Post treatment follow-up (28 days after last dose) (approximately 12 months)|Part A and Part B: Number of Participants with Vital Sign Abnormalities and/or AEs, Participants with potentially clinically significant vital signs values will be determined., Part A: From screening until post-treatment follow-up (28 days after last dose) (approximately 13 days if continuing into Part B); Part B: From Cycle 1 Day 1 until Post treatment follow-up (28 days after last dose) (approximately 12 months)|Part A and Part B: Number of Participants with Electrocardiogram (ECG) Abnormalities and/or AEs, Participants with potentially clinically significant ECG values will be determined., Part A: From screening until post-treatment follow-up (28 days after last dose) (approximately 13 days if continuing into Part B); Part B: From Cycle 1 Day 1 until Post treatment follow-up (28 days after last dose) (approximately 12 months)|Part A and Part B: Number of Participants with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) Abnormalities and/or AEs, Participants with potentially clinically significant ECOG PS values will be determined., Part A: From screening until post-treatment follow-up (28 days after last dose) (approximately 13 days if continuing into Part B); Part B: From Cycle 1 Day 1 until Post treatment follow-up (28 days after last dose) (approximately 12 months)
This study will comprise of two study parts, Part A and Part B. Part A of the study will assess the effect of multiple doses of Itraconazole on the single dose pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of AZD5305 which will last up to 13 days. The patients will then continue into Part B and receive AZD5305 monotherapy at the discretion of the Investigator if the patients are deemed to still derive benefit from continued treatment until disease progression.

The Part A of this study follows a non-randomized, open-label, 2-intervention design. Patients will receive the following two study interventions, AZD5305 and Itraconazole: a single oral dose of AZD5305 alone, multiple oral doses of itraconazole alone, and then a single oral dose of AZD5305 administered concomitantly with multiple doses of itraconazole.

In Part B, the patients may continue the study with AZD5305 monotherapy after completing Part A of the study. AZD5305 monotherapy will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicities, initiation of alternative anticancer therapy, withdrawal of consent, or other reasons to discontinue study treatment occur.
