Studies involving gene expression profiling and next generation sequencing have demonstrated that CNS lymphomas mostly are of the ABC-subtype and harbor mutations that reinforce BCR signaling. Ibrutinib, as the first BTK inhibitor, showed substantial activity in patients with R/R PCNSL and R/R SCNSL. Zanubrutinib is a novel BTK inhibitor with proven activity in patients with various B-cell lymphomas addicted to the B-cell receptor signaling pathway. In addition, pharmacological studies demonstrated the free drug exposure of zanubrutinib at 160 mg BID is roughly 10 times that of ibrutinib at 560 mg QD, and penetration into the CNS by zanubrutinib and ibrutinib is similar, suggesting the potential activity of zanubrutinib in the treatment of CNS lymphomas. However, the outcome of R/R PCNSL and R/R SCNSL patients treated with zanubrutinib monotherapy is still unclear.
