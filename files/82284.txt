Tesetaxel Plus Capecitabine and Cisplatin in Advanced Gastric Cancer
Cisplatin, an intravenously administered platinum agent, in combination with an intravenously administered taxane and capecitabine has been shown to improve time to disease progression and overall survival in previously untreated patients with gastric cancer.

This study is being performed to evaluate an orally administered taxane (tesetaxel) in combination with cisplatin and capecitabine in previously untreated patients with gastric cancer.
