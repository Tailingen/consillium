Study of IDE397 in Participants With Solid Tumors Harboring MTAP Deletion
This is a Phase 1, open-label, multicenter, dose escalation and expansion study of the safety, PK, PD, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of IDE397 as a single agent and in combination with other anticancer agents including taxanes (docetaxel, paclitaxel), or sacituzumab govitecan (SG), in adult patients with selected advanced or metastatic MTAP-deleted advanced solid tumors who are unresponsive to standard of care therapy. IDE397 is a small molecule inhibitor of methionine adenosyltransferase 2 alpha (MAT2A).
