A Study of AC176 for the Treatment of Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer
This clinical trial is evaluating a drug called AC176 in Chinese participants with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have progressed on at least one prior systemic therapy.

The main goals of this study are to:

Evaluate the safety and tolerability of AC176, evaluate pharmacokinetics and preliminary antitumor activity of AC176
