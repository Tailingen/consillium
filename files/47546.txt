A Study of ADRX-0405 in Subjects With Select Advanced Solid Tumors
The primary purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics, and to identify the optimal dose of ADRX-0405 in patients with select advanced solid tumors.
Solid Tumors
DRUG: ADRX-0405
Incidence of adverse events, Until study completion (estimated 2 years)
Measurement of End of Infusion or observed maximum blood concentration (Ceoi orCmax) of ADRX-0405, Measured from pharmacokinetic (PK) blood samples, Until study completion (estimated 2 years)|Measurement of trough concentration (Ctrough) of ADRX-0405, Measured from PK blood samples, Until study completion (estimated 2 years)|Measurement of area under the blood concentration-time curve (AUC) of ADRX-0405, Measured from PK blood samples, Until study completion (estimated 2 years)|Measurement of partial area under the concentration-time curve after first dose (AUC0-21) of ADRX-0405 and as appropriate, Measured from PK blood samples, Until study completion (estimated 2 years)|Measurement of terminal or apparent terminal half-life (t1/2) of ADRX-0405, Measured from PK blood samples, Until study completion (estimated 2 years)|Measurement of systemic clearance (CL) and volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) as appropriate of ADRX-0405, Measured from PK blood samples, Until study completion (estimated 2 years)|Incidence of anti-drug antibody (ADA) to ADRX-0405, Measured from ADA blood samples, Until study completion (estimated 2 years)|Measurement of objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1, Percentage of subjects achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), Until study completion (estimated 2 years)|ORR per Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3), Percentage of subjects achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), Until study completion (estimated 2 years)|Measurement of duration of response (DOR), Time from first response until first evidence of disease progression (PD) or death from any cause, Until study completion (estimated 2 years)|Measurement of disease control rate (DCR), Percentage of subjects achieving CR, PR or stable disease (SD), Until study completion (estimated 2 years)|Measurement of progression free survival (PFS), Time from the start of study drug until first evidence of PD or death from any cause, Until study completion (estimated 2 years)|Measurement of radiographic progression free survival (rPFS), Time from the start of study drug until first radiographic documentation of PD, or death from any cause, whichever comes first, Until study completion (estimated 2 years)|Measurement of overall survival (OS), Time from the start of study drug until death from any cause, Until study completion (estimated 2 years)
This is a 2-part study. The Phase 1a will consist of a dose escalation of ADRX-0405 to evaluate initial safety and tolerability in patients with select advanced solid tumors \[including metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), gastric cancer (GC), and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)\], and to identify the recommended dose to be used in the Phase 1b. The Phase 1b will further evaluate the safety and tolerability, as well as preliminary efficacy, and identify the optimal dose of ADRX-0405 in subjects with previously treated metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).
