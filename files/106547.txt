The Role of Circadian Rhythms in Cancer-Related Symptoms
Emerging evidence indicates that circadian rhythms may be disrupted following cancer and its treatment, and that circadian rhythm disruption may be an underlying pathophysiological mechanism of cancer- and cancer treatment-related symptoms (CRS) such as fatigue, sleep disturbance, cognitive impairment, and depressed mood. Given the detrimental effect of CRS on cancer survivors' quality of life, and a pressing demand for effective interventions to treat CRS, there is a need for a comprehensive examination of circadian disruption related to cancer and its treatment, and its association with CRS. The study will prospectively examine circadian rhythms and a CRS composite score in recently diagnosed breast cancer patients from prior to surgery or chemotherapy to 12 months later. A matched healthy control group will serve as a comparison.
