Fludarabine and Cytarabine Versus High-dose Cytarabine for CBF-AML
The purpose of the study is to determine whether Fludarabine in combination with cytarabine is more effective than high-dose cytarabine in post-remission therapy for patients with core-binding factor acute myeloid leukemia
Acute Myeloid Leukemia|Core-Binding Factor
DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: Cytarabine
Percentage of participants with disease recurrence, Comparing the percentage of participants with disease recurrence with two therapeutic regimen, one year
Percentage of Participants in survival, Comparing the percentage of Participants in survival with two therapeutic regimen, one year
The recurrence rate, relapse-free survival rate, and overall survival rate of CBF-AML patients were compared between FA and HIDAC regimens. Observe the prognostic value of factors such as c-KIT gene mutation and minimal residual disease (MRD).
