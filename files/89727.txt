Description of Neurocognitive and Psychiatric Disorders Associated with Targeted Therapies Used in the Treatment of Lung Cancers with ALK/ROS1 Fusion and Their Impact on Patients' Quality of Life: Construction of an Experimental Patient-researcher Collaborative Care and Research Pathway
Targeted cancer therapies have a higher therapeutic index than chemotherapy and are prescribed to tens of thousands of patients in France each year. These treatments modify often ubiquitous signaling pathways involved in neuronal synaptic plasticity, the cellular substrate of cognitive and psychiatric functions. Neurocognitive and psychiatric disorders associated with targeted therapies are poorly described and therefore still poorly understood, although they appear to be clinically more severe than chemobrain (neurocognitive disorders related to chemotherapy).

The case of patients with metastatic lung cancer with ALK/ROS1 fusion is emblematic. These cancers are treated very effectively with oral targeted therapies inhibiting the tyrosine kinase activity of ALK or ROS1 proteins (ITK-ALK/ROS1), with survival that can exceed 10 years. However, neurocognitive and psychiatric disorders associated with anti-ITK-ALK/ROS1 are reported in 7 to 60% of patients, with a prevalence of about 10% with anti-ITK-ALK/ROS1 brigatinib or alectinib and up to 53% with lorlatinib in industrial therapeutic trials. These disorders appear to be particularly frequent and severe with lorlatinib, including cognitive disorders - especially memory - mood disorders such as anxiety, depression and emotional lability, and psychotic disorders. Current therapeutic trials and care pathways are not designed to take into account these side effects related to anti-ITK-ALK/ROS1. Their incidence is therefore probably underestimated.

The DRACONIS project aims to:

(1) describe the complaints +/- neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric disorders associated with anti-ITK-ALK/ROS1 through a rigorous neuropsychological and psychiatric evaluation (i.e. patient phenotyping) and (2) understand the experience of complaints +/- neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric disorders associated with anti-ITK-ALK/ROS1 and their consequences on patients' quality of life in a comprehensive approach.

The DRACONIS project is part of a multidisciplinary and collaborative approach through the establishment of a partnership between researchers, clinicians and representatives of the anti-ITK-ALK/ROS1 France Cancer du Poumon patient association. The project is notably monitored by a joint scientific committee composed of researchers, clinicians, patients and patient caregivers.

OTHER: Assessments of neuropsychiatric, neurocognitive and psychosocial alterations
Neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric characterization of patients on anti-ITK-ALK/ROS1 targeted therapy who reported treatment-releated neurocognitive and/or neuropsychiatric complaints or disorders, Exploratory and comprehensive approach to neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric disorders that may be experienced by patients treated with anti-ALK/ROS1 targeted therapy for ALK/RO1 lung cancer. The characterization of complaints with or without associated neurocognitive and/or neuropsychiatric disorders will be achieved by combining the results of neuropsychological assessments and psychiatric evaluations., From enrollmenet day 1 visite to the end of the participation, day 2.
