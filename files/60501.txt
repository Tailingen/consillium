A Study on the Safety of GEN1044 (DuoBodyÂ®-CD3x5T4) in Patients With Malignant Solid Tumors
The purpose of the trial is to evaluate the safety, determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), and assess preliminary clinical activity of GEN1044 in patients with solid tumors.

BIOLOGICAL: GEN1044 is an immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) bispecific antibody targeting CD3 and 5T4.
Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), The DLT was defined as Grade (G) \>= 3 cytokine release syndrome or immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome; any G3 or 4 hematologic and non-hematologic toxicity (with exceptions defined by the protocol); laboratory abnormality that required clinically significant medical intervention, led to hospitalization, persisted for \>1 week, or resulted in a drug-induced liver injury; G3 or 4 febrile neutropenia; liver toxicity defined by Hy's law; any treatment-related toxicity that caused treatment discontinuation during Cycle 1; or any G5 toxicity., From Day 1 to Day 21 of first cycle|Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Treatment Emergent Serious Adverse Events (TESAEs), An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an AE that meets one of the following criteria: fatal or life-threatening; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; constitutes a congenital anomaly/birth defect; medically significant (an event that jeopardizes the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above \[medical and scientific judgment must be exercised in deciding whether an AE is 'medically significant'\]); required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. A TEAE is defined as an AE occurring or worsening between the first dose of GEN1044 and 30 days after the last dose received., Day 1 through Day 263 (corresponding to maximum observed duration)|Number of Participants With Abnormal Laboratory Values, Number of participants with laboratory values of Grade \>= 3 by NCI-CTCAE v5.0 are reported. The NCI-CTCAE is a descriptive terminology that is used for gradings (Grade 1-5) of Adverse Events (AEs) and of laboratory values; the latter being summarized here.

This table reports laboratory values graded only on the numerical value of the reported parameter and is therefore not graded by symptoms or signs. The abnormal laboratory values assessed by the investigator as being AEs are reported also in the AE table.

In case a participant reported multiple severity grades for a laboratory value, only the maximum grade was used., Day 1 through Day 263 (corresponding to maximum observed duration)
Number of Participants With Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR), The radiological evaluation based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) was performed by investigator using computed tomography (CT) scan/ magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan/ positron emission tomography (PET) scan. The CR was defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and all pathological lymph nodes must have decreased to \< 10 mm in short axis. The PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum of longest diameters., Day 1 through Day 233|Number of Participants With Antidrug Antibodies (ADAs) Positive to GEN1044, The detection and titer characterization of ADAs was performed using validated, specific, and sensitive electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) methods. Number of participants with ADA positive post baseline to GEN1044 are reported., Day 1 through Day 263 (predose on Day 1 of Cycles 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and then on Day 1 of every 4 cycles thereafter, end of treatment [EOT], and 30 days after last study drug)
The trial is an open-label, multi-center safety trial of GEN1044. The trial consists of two parts: a dose-escalation part (Phase 1) and an expansion part (Phase 2a). The expansion part of the trial will be initiated once the RP2D has been determined from Phase 1.
