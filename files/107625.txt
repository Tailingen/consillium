Breast-Conserving Surgery and Radiation Therapy in Patients With Multiple Ipsilateral Breast Cancer
RATIONALE: Breast-conserving surgery is a less invasive type of surgery for breast cancer and may have fewer side effects and improve recovery. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x rays to kill tumor cells. Giving radiation therapy after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial studies how well breast-conserving surgery and radiation therapy work in treating patients with multiple ipsilateral breast cancer
Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: therapeutic conventional surgery|RADIATION: whole breast irradiation
Local Recurrence, Local recurrence(LR) defined as histologic evidence of ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive breast cancer in the ipsilateral breast or chest wall assessed up to 5 years. The estimated 5-year cumulative incidence of LR will be reported as a percentage of patients expected to experience a LR at 5 years., 5 years
Conversion Rate to Mastectomy, The conversion rate to mastectomy secondary to persistent positive margins; poor cosmesis within the first year of attempting BCS; or inability to satisfy the radiation dose constraints on the boost to the lumpectomy bed of each site of disease., 5 years|Type and Severity of Adverse Effects of Breast-conserving Surgery and Radiation as Assessed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0, Up to 30 days post-treatment|Radiation-related Side Effects, Radiation-related side effects of whole-breast radiation with a boost to 1 large or \> 1 lumpectomy site as assessed by NCI CTCAE version 4.0., 17 months|Patient's Perception of Cosmesis, Patient's perception of cosmesis will be assessed at their initial post-operative visit as well as 24 months following completion of WBI using the BREAST-Q subscales: satisfaction with breasts, satisfaction with overall outcome, and physical well-being. Patients registered after surgery will not partake in the pre-operative assessment but will be asked to complete subsequent cosmesis surveys. The total score for each of these subscales will be determined using the BREAST-Q scoring module (http://www.mskcc.org/mskcc/shared/Breast-Q/scoreBQ.html). The BREAST-Q has multiple domains, and each domain score is obtained by transforming the raw scale item responses with the Q-Score software program. Each domain results in an independent score from 0 to 100 (higher scores indicate greater satisfaction or quality of life)., 24 months
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To assess the local recurrence (LR) rate with breast-conservation in patients with multiple ipsilateral primary breast cancer (MIBC).

Secondary

* To examine the conversion rate to mastectomy secondary to persistent positive margins; poor cosmesis within the first year of attempting breast-conservation surgery (BCS) or inability to satisfy the radiation dose constraints on the boost to the lumpectomy bed of each site of disease.
* To assess whether patients who did not undergo re-excision for close margins (\< 2 mm) have a higher local recurrence (LR) rate than patients for whom negative margins were achieved.
* To assess patient's perception of cosmesis and incidence of breast lymphedema.
* To assess incidence of breast lymphedema
* To examine the type and severity of adverse effects of breast conserving surgery and radiation for women with multiple ipsilateral primary breast cancer (MIBC).
* To examine the radiation-related side effects of whole-breast radiation with a boost to 1 large or \> 1 lumpectomy site.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients undergo breast-conserving surgery (BCS) with all lesions resected to negative margins using 1 lumpectomy or 2-3 separate lumpectomy incisions at the discretion of the surgeon. Patients receive adjuvant chemotherapy and/or endocrine therapy at the discretion of the treating medical oncologist based on tumor characteristics.
