A Study of Niraparib as Maintenance Therapy Following First-Line Platinum-Based Chemotherapy in Patients With Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer
Niraparib is a PARP inhibitor. The study is a 2:1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center,phase 3 study of ZL-2306 (niraparib) as maintenance therapy following first-line platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with extensive-stage disease small cell lung cancer (ED-SCLC) to evaluate the efficacy and safety.
Extensive-stage Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: ZL-2306(nirapairb)|DRUG: Placebo
BICR-assessed progression-free survival (PFS), The time assessed by the Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) from randomization to progressive disease or death due to various causes, whichever occurs; progressive disease will be assessed in accordance with RECIST 1.1 criteria., Approximately 14 months since the first subject enrolled|Overall survival (OS), The time from randomization to death due to any cause., Approximately 48 months since first subject enrolled
Investigator-assessed PFS, the investigator-assessed time from randomization to progressive disease or death due to various causes, whichever occurs; progressive disease will be assessed in accordance with RECIST 1.1 criteria., Approximately 14 months since the first subject enrolled
Change in patient reported outcomes (PROs)--physical functioning domain, Evaluations of the quality of life of patients with small cell lung cancer include summary and analysis of absolute values and changes from baseline of various fields and single items in the patient-completed EORTC questionnaire QLQ-C30 (Version 3.0) and QLQ-LC13 Chinese version to evaluate the quality of life of lung cancer patients in the treatment group and the control group., Approximately 48 months since first subject enrolled
