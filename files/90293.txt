An Integrated Consent Model Study to Compare Two Standard of Care Schedules for Monitoring Cardiac Function in Patients Receiving Trastuzumab for Early Stage Breast Cancer
Several large adjuvant trastuzumab trials have demonstrated improved overall survival, in participants with early stage breast cancer, with a 33% decrease in risk of death. However, retrospective analyses of participant outcomes in these trials have demonstrated increased risk of cardiotoxicity (i.e damage to the heart) in a small number of patients (4-8%).

At this time, investigators are unable to predict which participants are at increased risk of cardiac-related treatment complications. Currently all patients receive regular cardiac imaging throughout their one year of trastuzumab treatment.

At this time, the optimal monitoring schedule for trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity remains unknown, and several published consensus guidelines are currently in use as "standard of care.
