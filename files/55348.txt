Delanzomib (CEP-18770) in Combination With Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone in Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
The primary objective of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CEP-18770 in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in participants with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: CEP-18770|DRUG: Lenalidomide|DRUG: Dexamethasone
Overall Response Rate (ORR) in Participants Treated at the (Maximum Tolerated Dose) MTD, as Assessed Using International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Criteria, The ORR is defined as percentage of participants who achieve a best response of stringent complete response (sCR), complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), or partial response (PR) during the study. sCR: negative immunofixation in serum and urine; disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas; \< 5% plasma cells in bone marrow; normal free light chain (FLC) ratio; and absence of clonal cells in bone marrow. CR: negative immunofixation in serum and urine; disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas; and \<5% plasma cells in bone marrow. VGPR: serum and urine M-protein detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis; 90% or greater reduction in serum M-protein level and urine M-protein level less than 100 milligrams (mg)/24 hours. PR: ≥50% reduction in serum M-protein level; ≥90% reduction in 24-hour urinary M-protein level or reduction to less than 200 mg per 24 hours; and ≥50% reduction in the size of any soft tissue plasmacytomas present at baseline., From the first administration of CEP-18770 up to approximately 1.5 years|Maximum Tolerated Dose of CEP-18770, MTD was based on the assessment of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during cycle 1 only and was defined as the highest dose at which fewer than one-third of participants in a cohort experience DLT. A DLT was defined as any of the following drug-related toxicities occurring during Cycle 1: Hematologic adverse events (AEs) (Grade 4 hematologic AEs, Grade 3 hematologic AEs with sequelae); Grade 3 nonhematologic AEs; Neuropathy (Grade 2 neuropathy, Grade 1 neuropathy with pain, worsening grade of neuropathy or new symptoms of pain associated with neuropathy); Any other toxicity that, in the judgment of the principal investigator, was a DLT; If a participant cannot receive 75% of the planned dose for any of the 3 agents (missing \>1 dose of CEP-18770, or \>5 doses of lenalidomide, or \>1 dose of dexamethasone \[either consecutively or separately\]), due to a drug-related AE, the event was considered a DLT, even if the grade of toxicity was lower than specified DLT determination as described above., Cycle 1 (28 days)
Duration of Response (DOR) for Participants Treated With CEP-18770 at the MTD, as Assessed Using IMWG Criteria, DOR was defined as the time interval from the date of first response (sCR, CR, VGPR, or PR) to the date of disease progression. sCR, CR, VGPR, and PR as defined in outcome measure 1. Disease progression was defined as any 1 or more of the following: Increase of 25% or more from lowest response level in any 1 or more of the following: - serum M-component (absolute increase must be ≥0.5 grams \[g\]/deciliter \[dL\]), - urine M-component (absolute increase must be ≥200 mg/24 hours), bone marrow plasma cell percentage ≥10%; definite development of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas or definite increase in the size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas; and development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium \>11.5 mg/dL) that could be attributed solely to the plasma cell proliferation disorder., From the date of first response to the date of disease progression (up to approximately 1.5 years)|Time to Progression (TTP) for Participants Treated With CEP-18770 at the MTD, as Assessed Using IMWG Criteria, TTP was defined as the time interval from the date of first dose to the date of disease progression. Disease progression was defined as any 1 or more of the following: Increase of 25% or more from lowest response level in any 1 or more of the following: - serum M-component (absolute increase must be ≥0.5 g/dL), - urine M-component (absolute increase must be ≥200 mg/24 hours), bone marrow plasma cell percentage ≥10%; definite development of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas or definite increase in the size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas; and development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium \>11.5 mg/dL) that could be attributed solely to the plasma cell proliferation disorder., From the date of first dose of study drug to the date of disease progression (up to approximately 1.5 years)|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. SAEs were defined as death, a life-threatening AE, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or an important medical event that jeopardized participant and required medical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this definition. A summary of other non-serious AEs and all serious AEs, regardless of causality is located in Reported AE section., From the first administration of CEP-18770 up to approximately 1.5 years|Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of CEP-18770, Before and immediately after end of infusion (EOI) and at approximately 2, 4, and 8 hours after the EOI on Days 1 and 15 of Cycle 1|Time to Reach Cmax (Tmax) of CEP-18770, Before and immediately after end of infusion (EOI) and at approximately 2, 4, and 8 hours after the EOI on Days 1 and 15 of Cycle 1|Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve From Time 0 to t (AUC0-t) of CEP-18770, Before and immediately after end of infusion (EOI) and at approximately 2, 4, and 8 hours after the EOI on Days 1 and 15 of Cycle 1
After cycle 1, the start of treatment in each cycle may occur within a 3-day window. In addition, after cycle 2, the start of treatment in cycle 3 may be delayed by 1 week if, in the opinion of the investigator, the delay is warranted. If a participant cannot receive 75% of the planned dose for any of the 3 agents (missing more than 1 dose of CEP-18770, or more than 5 doses of lenalidomide \[either consecutively or separately\], or more than 1 dose of dexamethasone \[either consecutively or separately\]), due to a drug-related adverse event, the event will be considered a dose limiting toxicity (DLT), even if the grade of toxicity is lower than specified DLT determination. Participants will receive intravenous (IV) CEP-18770 on Days 1, 8, and 15, oral lenalidomide on days 1 through 21, and oral dexamethasone on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each 28-day cycle. Treatment with all 3 drugs will continue for up to 12 cycles (approximately 11 months), or until disease progression or intolerable toxicities. Participants experiencing clinical benefit may continue to receive additional treatment at the investigator's discretion and following sponsor notification. In part 2 of the study, participants will receive CEP-18770 as a slow IV bolus (approximately 1 milliliter per minute) at the maximum tolerated dose on days 1, 8, and 15 of every 28-day cycle. Participants who complete or discontinue study drug treatment and whose disease has not progressed will have study visits every 7-9 weeks during follow-up until disease progression, death, or until they have been monitored for 1 year after the first administration of study drug, whichever occurs first.
