Establishment and Clinical Application of Risk Classification Model Based on Molecular Typing of Medulloblastoma in Children
The purpose of this study:(1) Development of a new risk classification model for childhood medulloblastoma. (2) Evaluation and improvement of existing individualized treatment protocols.
Medulloblastoma, Childhood
OTHER: Prospective observational study, no intervention
Molecular typing, Medulloblastoma can be classified into four molecular types: WNT, SHH, G3 and G4., 2022-2030|Overall survival, the time from operation to death, 2022-2030|Progression free survival, The time from operation to disease progression, 2022-2030|Quality of life scale, A scale for evaluating the quality of life of patients after operation, 2022-2030|Adjunctive treatment, Patients receive postoperative radiotherapy or chemotherapy, 2022-2030
Age at diagnosis, 2022-2030|BMI, weight and height will be combined to report BMI in kg/m\^2, 2022-2030
Medulloblastoma (medulloblastoma, MB) is the most common intracranial malignant tumor in children, accounting for 20% of all central nervous system tumors in children, seriously affecting the quality of life and life span of children. Based on a retrospective analysis of previous MB cases in our center, we found that the clinical prognosis of previous MB patients in our center was worse than that in foreign countries, with an overall five-year survival rate of about 65%, and nearly 30% of the patients had tumor recurrence and metastasis within 2 years after the operation, and the prognosis was poor. We analyzed the possible reasons as follows: (1) the compliance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy in children with MB in our center was poor, and some of the patients only completed radiotherapy and had poor compliance with chemotherapy; (2) due to the lack of family doctor system, the tumor of the newly diagnosed patients was huge, which seriously affected the important brain function and clinical prognosis; (3) the patients were not followed up strictly and regularly after operation to monitor tumor recurrence, which led to poor treatment effect after recurrence.

(4) the unified treatment standard has not been formed yet, and the treatment mode for patients is complex.

As the largest neurosurgery and pediatric neurosurgery center in China, the center intends to prospectively establish a high-quality homogeneous MB observation cohort in children, make use of the center's case resources and biological sample processing advantages, and carry out accurate treatment research on children's MB through regular follow-up and systematic management of the clinical cohort.
