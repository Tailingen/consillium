Evaluating Thermal Ablation in the Treatment of Cervical Neoplasia
Longitudinal study in Burundi to evaluate the effectiveness, the acceptability and safety of thermal ablation in the treatment of cervical neoplasia.
Cervical Neoplasia
DEVICE: Treatment of cervical neoplasia by thermal ablation
Cure rate based on VIA and colposcopy assessment, Effectiveness is measured by the cure rate after 1 year based on VIA and colposcopy assessment., 1 year|Acceptability of thermal ablation, Measured by existence of minor/moderate adverse events during the follow-up., 6 weeks|Acceptability of thermal ablation, Measured by the satisfaction level using a nine-level Likert scale (from 1. Very unsatisfied to 9. very satisfied)., At day 1|Safety of thermal ablation, Measured by existence of severe adverse events during the follow-up period., 1 year
The study population consisted of women with an abnormal VIA test or an abnormal colposcopy examination. A total of 86 women with lesions eligible to ablative treatment were counselled and treated by thermal ablation. Informed consent was signed by each participant. Just after treatment, they were inquired about the level of pain during the procedure, and their level of satisfaction with the treatment. They were followed-up at 6 weeks for any complication and re-assessed by VIA and colposcopy at 12 months for any persistent or recurrent lesion and for any adverse event.
