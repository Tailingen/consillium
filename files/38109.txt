Concurrent Nab-P/Carboplatin and Thoracic Radiotherapy in Squamous Cell Lung Cancer
Nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin showed better treatment response compared with cremophor-based paclitaxel and carboplatin as first-line therapy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer, especially for squamous cell cancer. This study is conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nab-paclitaxel, carboplatin and concurrent radiotherapy in patients with local advanced inoperable squamous cell lung cancer.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung|Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Nab-paclitaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin|RADIATION: Thoracic radiation therapy
PFS (progression-free survival ), PFS is defined as time from the start of treatment to death, progression of disease, or the last follow-up data, whichever comes first. Progression is evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. PFS will be analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method., 5 years from patient enrollment
ORR (Overall Response Rate ), The number of participants that achieve either a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR). Response is evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1., one month after the end of all treatment|LCR (Local Control Rate), The number of participants that achieve either a complete response (CR) , a partial response (PR) or stable disease(SD)., one month after the end of all treatment|OS (Overall survival), Overall survival is defined as time from the start of treatment until death. Overall survival will be analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method., 5 years from patient enrollment|Number of participants with adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, The adverse events(AE) is evaluated by National Cancer Institute- Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events(NCI -CTCAE) 4.02., 5 years from patient enrollment|Patient quality of life (QOL), Measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Lung (FACT-L).The total range of scores:0-144,and higher values represent a better outcome., 5 years from patient enrollment
This study was conducted to explore the efficacy and safety of concurrent concurrent nab-paclitaxel, carboplatin and thoracic radiotherapy in inoperable local advanced squamous cell lung cancer. Patients will be given nab-paclitaxel weekly at a dose of 40mg/m2, in combination with carboplatin (AUC 2) weekly during concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Thoracic radiation was administered at a dose of 60-66 Gy/30-33 fractions, both 3 dimensional conformal and intensity modulated radiation therapy are allowed.
