Dendritic Cell-based Immunotherapy in Treatment Gastric Cancer
Study objectives are to investigate the efficacy and safety of activated autologous dendritic cells (DCs) in treatment of gastric cancer. DCs are activated by the proteins from autologous tumor cell membrane and cytokines in vitro. The efficacy endpoints include objective response, immune-cell response, recurrent rate after a radical surgery, progression-free survival and overall survival, and the safety endpoints include adverse events, laboratory tests, ECG, ECOG-PT, etc.
Gastric Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: activated DCs|PROCEDURE: radical surgery only
progression-free survival, Time to progression/death or censored time, 3 years
recurrent rate, the rate of cancer recurring after surgery, 3 years|overall survival rate, time to death or censored time, 5 years|immune-cells response, CD4/CD8 T lymphocyte percentage change, 3 months|Adverse event rate, Adverse event rate, 3 months
Study objectives are to investigate the efficacy and safety of activated autologous dendritic cells (DCs) in treatment of gastric cancer. The autologous DCs are collected and enriched from peripheral blood, and then are activated by the proteins from autologous tumor cell membrane and cytokines in vitro. The efficacy endpoints include objective response, immune-cell response, recurrent rate after a radical surgery, progression-free survival and overall survival, and the safety endpoints include adverse events, laboratory tests, ECG, ECOG-PT, etc. All patients will be followed up for at least 2 years after treatment.
