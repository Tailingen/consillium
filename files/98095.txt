This study uses a randomized controlled and longitudinal study design. We will compare two groups - an intervention group and a control group - to test the effects of an early physical therapy education intervention for breast cancer survivors who are candidates for breast cancer surgery. Because of the nature of the intervention (patient early education with 1:1 discussion of educational materials) we will be unable to introduce blinding of the participant as well as the staff.
