Tumor Exosome Liquid Biopsy Strategy to Diagnose Pancreatic Cancer
This is an observational study of patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer by pathology, with a control group of patients with pathology suggestive of benign pancreatic lesions and normal subjects, and the diagnostic ability of exosomes to identify patients with pancreatic cancer was assessed through the detection of exosomes in the peripheral blood.

Characterization of proteins in tumor exosomes from patients with pancreatic cancer, We will select specific protein A from circulating exosomes of pancreatic cancer patients for further analysis., Up to 2 years from start of study|The expression of protein A in the circulating exosomes from patients, By detecting the expression of protein A in circulating exosomes of patients. the ROC curve of A+ circulating exosomes will be compared to clinical standard tumor biomarkers (e.g., CA199) in pancreatic cancer patients., Up to 2 years from start of study
