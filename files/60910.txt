Biliary Stricture|Biopsy Wound|Oncology
PROCEDURE: biliary biopsy
Efficacy of PTBD, Efficacy of PTBD : bilirubinemia after PTFB at Day 7, 7 days|accuracy for percutaneous biliary biopsy (PTFB), Accuracy of PTFB : percentage of true positive and true negative results by pathologists, from baseline up to 1 month|incidence of PTFB-related adverse events, Number of patients with PTFB related adverse-events as assessed by Society of Interventional Radiology Standards of Practice Committee classification, up to 1 month after procedure
