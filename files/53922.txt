Phase 1/2 Study of IMC-R117C in Selected Advanced Cancers
This phase 1/2 first-in-human study is designed to test the safety and efficacy of IMC-R117C (PIWIL1 × CD3 ImmTAC® Bispecific Protein) as a single agent and in combination with other therapies in HLA-A\*02:01-positive participants with selected advanced cancers.
