Pilot Study of Chemotherapy for HPV-Associated Oropharyngeal Cancer
Doctors leading this study will give blood tests to head and neck cancer participants during the beginning of chemotherapy treatment (also known as induction therapy) to see if these blood tests can help predict tumor shrinkage after therapy and reduce the amount of additional radiotherapy or chemotherapy treatment the participant may need. This study will also examine ways to reduce overall side effects of treatment using robotic surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, or radiotherapy alone.

Feasibility of collection of serial HPV-DNA blood samples in patients undergoing treatment for Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma, To determine if it is possible (feasibility) to measure HPV-DNA using blood tests among participants undergoing induction chemotherapy followed by a second round of response-based therapy for their HPV-associated cancer. This feasibility will be determined by measuring the proportion of patients who complete chemotherapy treatment and HPV-DNA assessments., 16 weeks|Relationship Between HPV-DNA Found in Participant's Blood and Participant Response to Chemotherapy, To evaluate the relationship (aka correlation) between the amount of HPV-DNA found in a participant's plasma/blood and the participant's response to induction chemotherapy based on how their tumor responds to treatment., 16 weeks
Changes in Blood Containing HPV-DNA During Response-Based Therapy, To evaluate changes in blood containing HPV-DNA during a second round of chemotherapy (known as response-based chemo-radiotherapy) that will be based on how the participant responded to their first/induction phase of chemotherapy treatment. This outcome will be measured by checking quantitative HPV DNA in plasma with each cycle of induction chemotherapy, weekly during radiation treatment, and following completion of radiation at set time points within the study., 16 weeks|Side Effects of Cisplatin-Based Chemotherapy Treatment, To evaluate the side effects of weekly cisplatin-based treatment in participants receiving chemotherapy followed by a second round of response-based therapy for their HPV-associated cancer., 16 weeks|Tumor Response Among Participants Undergoing Transoral Robotic Surgery, To determine how participant's tumor/cancer responds when they are undergoing Transoral Robotic Surgery (TORS) following induction chemotherapy. TORs is surgery in which a robot with arms is used to remove cancer from hard-to-reach areas of the mouth and throat. Data about how patients' tumors respond in this study will be compared to similar data from a previous study., 20 weeks|Time to Disease Recurrence, Length of time participants remain without evidence of disease., 5 years|Overall Survival, Length of time until participant death., 5 years|Locoregional Control, Number of participants who experience local control of their primary tumors after treatment., 5 years|Distant Control, Number of participants who experience control of metastatic disease (distant tumors) after treatment., 5 years
