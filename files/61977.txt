Distinct Metastatic Phenotypes Between Early-onset and Late-onset Colorectal Cancer
The clinical and pathological features of early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC) differ from those of late-onset colorectal cancer (LOCRC). Our research aims to thoroughly elucidate the distinctions between them by analyzing clinical prognosis, metastatic patterns, gene expression, and genomic mutation profiles. Our deliberation will uncover latent strategies for personalized therapeutic of both EOCRC and LOCRC.
