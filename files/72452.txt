Study on Screening, Verification and Intervention of High-risk Patients With Liver Cancer
The goal of this clinical trial is to test the outcomes of HBsAg(+) patients in the treatments of NAs vs NAs plus IFN . The main questions it aims to answer are:

1. Clinical effect analysis of nucleoside analogs (NAs) group a group and NAs plus interferon group after 48 weeks of treatment;
2. Repetitive effect and time effect of different drug treatment at different follow-up time points;
3. To evaluate the difference of therapeutic effect of NAs or NAs combined with interferon;
4. Follow up and compare the incidence of early liver cancer in each group. Participants will be asked to receive NAs or NAs combined with interferon treatments, and Regular blood sampling and color ultrasound examination.

Researchers will compare control group to see if occurrence of liver cancer.
