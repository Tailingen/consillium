Impact on Quality of Life in Patients Undergoing Total Gastrectomy or Proximal Gastrectomy for Adenocarcinoma of Esophagogastric Junction
The purpose of this study is to find out more about differences of the quality of life in patients undergoing total gastrectomy or proximal gastrectomy for adenocarcinoma of esophagogastric junction. To find a better reconstruction for patients who received total gastrectomy.
Adenocarcinoma of Esophagogastric Junction.
OTHER: Total Gastrectomy or Proximal Gastrectomy
Change in QOL (Quality of Life), From preoperative following gastrectomy, as measured with the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 and QLQ-STO22 questionnaires., 5years
Nutritional status of patients, 5 years
Overall, the incidence of stomach cancer worldwide is declining with geographical variation. However, an increase in the incidence rate of adenocarcinoma of esophagogastric junction, called cardia or AEG has been observed in recent years. AEG may represent a specific histopathological and biologic entity. In the treatment AEG there is argument over whether proximal gastractomy(PG) or total gastractomy (TG) should be done. The quality of life (QOL) of the patients following TG or PG arouses people's attention. The purpose of this study was to evaluate differences of the quality of life in patients undergoing total gastrectomy or proximal gastrectomy for adenocarcinoma of esophagogastric junction.
