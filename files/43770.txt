Anti-PD(L)1 and SBRT in the Treatment of Advanced, Platinum-Refractory Urothelial Carcinoma
This is a feasibility trial of anti-PDL1/PD1 (pembrolizumab) and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in patients with advanced, platinum-refractory urothelial carcinoma.
Urothelial Carcinoma
DRUG: Pembrolizumab|RADIATION: SBRT
The Percentage of Subjects Who Receive 4 Doses of Pembrolizumab and at Least One Session of Treatment of SBRT, Feasibility will be determined by the percentage of subjects who receive 4 doses of pembrolizumab and at least one session of treatment of SBRT (Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy) within 15 weeks from the first dose of pembrolizumab., 15 weeks
The Number of Grades 3-5 Drug Related Adverse Events (AEs), The number of grades 3-5 drug related adverse events (AEs) will be recorded. AEs will be graded using the CTCAE v4.03, 30 days post last dose|The Percentage of Patients That Respond to Treatment, The percentage of patients that achieve either a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). Response will be reported separately using RECIST and irRECIST criteria.

CR (RECIST): Disappearance of all target lesions, determined by two separate observations conducted not less than 4 weeks apart. There can be no appearance of new lesions CR (irRECIST): Disappearance of all lesions in two consecutive observations not less than 4 wk apart PR (RECIST): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD. There can be no appearance of new lesions PR (irRECIST): â‰¥50% decrease in tumor burden compared with baseline in two observations at least 4 wk apart, 51 weeks (up to 17, 3 week doses)|Progression Free Survival (PFS) Time, Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progressive disease (PD), or death, whichever occurs first, up to 24 months.

PD (RECIST): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started, or the appearance of one or more new lesions PD (irRECIST): At least 25% increase in tumor burden compared with nadir (at any single time point) in two consecutive observations at least 4 wk apart, 24 months
