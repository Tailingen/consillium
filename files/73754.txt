Hypophysectomy by Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Cancer-Related Pain
To learn if hypophysectomy (treatment of the pituitary gland) using a type of radiation treatment called stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) can help to relieve cancer-related pain.
Hypophysectomy
DEVICE: Stereotactic Radiosurgery
Safety and adverse events (AEs), Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, Through study completion; an average of 1 year
Primary Objective:

To determine the feasibility of enrollment and treatment of patients within MD Anderson Cancer Center with SRS hypophysectomy to plan future trials. Feasibility will be defined as completion of SRS hypophysectomy enrollment and treatment of the lead-in cohort (n=20 patients) within one year of trial activation.

Secondary Objectives:

To obtain estimates of the change from baseline over time after SRS hypophysectomy in participants with refractory cancer-related pain in the worst pain subscale of the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) short form.57

To obtain estimates of the change from baseline over time after SRS hypophysectomy in participants with refractory cancer-related pain in the pain composite scale of the BPI short form.57

To obtain estimates of the change after SRS hypophysectomy in participants with refractory cancer-related pain in the interference scale of the BPI short form.57

To obtain estimates of the change in the daily usage of opioid medications, calculated as oral morphine equivalents (OME), over time after SRS hypophysectomy in participants with refractory cancer-related pain.

To obtain estimates of the change in mood and depressive symptoms using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) composite score over time after SRS hypophysectomy in participants with refractory cancer-related pain.60

To obtain estimates of the change in beliefs on self-efficacy using the Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ) over time after SRS hypophysectomy in participants with refractory cancer-related pain.61

To obtain estimates of the change after SRS hypophysectomy in participants with refractory cancer-related pain in quality of life as measured by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 15 Palliative Care (QLC C15 PAL).59 To obtain estimates of neurologic toxicity related to SRS measured by the NCI's CTCAE v5.0.

Correlative Objectives:

To apply novel fMRI and DTI MRI protocols to characterize functional and connectome changes following SRS hypophysectomy.

To study neuroanatomic and histobiochemical changes of the pituitary gland/stalk after SRS hypophysectomy on post-mortem tissue.

To obtain estimates of neurocognitive changes following SRS hypophysectomy in participants with refractory cancer-related pain, including learning and memory (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised), attention (WAIS-IV Digit Span, Trail Making Test Part A, Stroop test, WAIS-IV Coding), and executive function (Trail Making Test Part B, Controlled Oral Word Association) referred to hereafter as "neurocognitive battery".63-66
