S9333A Study of Blood and Bone Marrow Samples From Patients With Previously Untreated Primary Acute Myeloid Leukemia
RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and bone marrow from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

PURPOSE: This research study is looking at blood and bone marrow samples from patients with previously untreated primary acute myeloid leukemia.

Association of specific clinicopathological variables and outcomes with calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II-γ (CaMKIIγ) activation (autophosphorylation), upon receipt of specimens
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine whether calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II-γ (CaMKIIγ) activation (autophosphorylation) is associated with specific clinicopathological variables and outcomes in blood and bone marrow samples from patients with previously untreated primary acute myeloid leukemia.

OUTLINE: Blood and bone marrow samples are analyzed by western blot using SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using anti-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II-γ (CaMKIIγ) and anti-phosphospecific (Thr286, 287) CaMKIIγ antibodies with signals detected via chemiluminescence. CaMKIIγ activation levels are linked to clinical variables within the SWOG database.
