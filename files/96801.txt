Surufatinib With or Wothout Immunotherapy for Advanced Colorectal Cancer in Later Line
This is a single-center, open-label, cohort clinical study to investigate the efficacy and safety of surufatinib with or without immunotherapy in patients with advanced colorectal cancer who failed front-line anti-angiogenic TKI therapy.

Patients have to received at least a second-line standard therapy or cannot tolerate other treatments, and have previously failed anti-angiogenic TKIs therapy(including but not limited to: fruquintinib/regorafenib/anlotinib) / apatinib, and are resistant to treatment, disease progression, intolerable toxicity or no continued benefit as assessed by investigator after therapy).

Patients who met the eligibility criteria are randomized 1:2 into two cohorts (cohort 1: surufatinib, cohort 2: surufatinib plus immunotherapy) to receive treatment until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent by the patient, or decision by the treating physician that discontinuation would be in the patient's best interest. The primary study endpoint was PFS(progression free survival).

DRUG: Chohort 1: Surufatinib|DRUG: Chohort 2: Immunotherapy|DRUG: Chohort 2: Surufatinib
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from enrollment to the first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Responses are according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as assessed by investigator, 36 months
overall survival (OS), OS is the time from enrollment to death due to any cause., 36 months|objective response rate (ORR), Defined as percentage of participants achieving assessed complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) by the investigator according to the RECIST 1.1., 36 months|disease control rate (DCR), DCR was defined as the percentage of participants who have a confirmed complete response（CR） or partial response（PR） or stable disease（SD） per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by investigator, 36 months|quality of life (QoL) assessed by the QLQ-C30, QoL was defined as specific questionnaires can be used to evaluate the daily living ability of patients, so as to evaluate the effect of anti-tumor drug treatment In clinical research, 36 months|adverse events (AE), overall incidence of adverse events (AE); incidence of grade 3 or higher AE; incidence of severe adverse events (SAE); incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation of drug use; incidence of AEs leading to suspension of drug use., 36 months
