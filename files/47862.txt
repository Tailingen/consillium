Study of Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin and Temsirolimus in Patients With Advanced Hepatocellular Cancer
This Phase II study will use the MTD from a previous Phase I study at the recommended dose for the combination regimen from the Phase I trial, Doxil 25mg/m2 IV Q 4 weeks and temsirolimus 25mg IV Q week.
Liver Neoplasms
DRUG: Temsirolimus 25mg and Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin 25mg/m2
Progression free survival (PFS), To determine whether the progression free survival (PFS) rate in patients with advanced HCC using this combination regimen of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin and temsirolimus exceeds 5 months in the majority of treated patients, justifying the further development of this therapeutic regimen in this patient population., 15 months
Toxicity and tolerability for this combination regimen, To further characterize the toxicity profile and tolerability for this combination regimen, 3 months|Disease control rate, objective response rate, and overall survival., To determine the disease control rate (DCR), objective response rate (ORR), and overall survival (OS) of this combination regimen, 15 months|mTOR inhibition, To determine whether S6 kinase is inhibited in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as an indication of adequate mTOR inhibitor exposure., 3 days|Pharmacogenomics, To measure Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) activity in PBMCs from the patients as an indication of adequate doxorubicin exposure54., 1 day|Polymoprhism assessment, To assess whether common polymorphisms in ABCB1 and CYP2B6 are associated with any changes in treatment response or survival55., 1 day
This proposal aims to capitalize on the consensus recommendations of the NCI panel, the known antitumor activity of doxorubicin in HCC, and the as yet unpublished results of a recently completed Phase I clinical trial (WU HRPO# 07-0447, NCT00703170) combining pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil®) and temsirolimus (Torisel®) in patients with advanced solid tumors. In this Phase I study, twenty-two patients were enrolled and treated. The MTD and recommended Phase II dose for the combination regimen from this trial is is Doxil 25mg/m2 IV Q 4 weeks and temsirolimus 25mg IV Q week. During the conduct of this study two patients experienced confirmed partial responses (PR). One patient had heavily pretreated metastatic breast cancer and remained on the study for 6 months. The second patient with a PR had HCC that was previously treated with sorafenib. She remained on the study regimen for 14 months and tolerated this treatment well. Based on the tolerability of the drug combination and the observed anti-tumor activity in HCC, the current Phase II study in HCC is proposed.
