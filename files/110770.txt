Safety of Intranodal ECI-006 in Melanoma Patients
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of cancer immunotherapy ECI-006 and to determine its ability to induce a measurable immune response against the tumor associated antigens.

In Cohort 1, ECI-006 will be administered 5 times by intranodal injection in melanoma patients after resection of their tumor.

In Cohort 2, ECI-006 will be administered 9 times by intranodal injection on top of standard of care anti PD1 in metastatic melanoma patients with stable disease after 3 to 12 months treatment.

ECI-006 activates key immunologically active cells to direct the immune system against the cancer. Expected potential risks for ECI-006 are non-serious and related to the local administration of the product. Hence, the therapy suggested here has the promise to offer considerable benefit to patients without any major risk.
