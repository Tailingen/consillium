An Open-Label Intervention Trial to Reduce Senescence and Improve Frailty in Adult Survivors of Childhood Cancer
This is a first-in survivor pilot study with the goal of establishing preliminary evidence of efficacy, safety, and tolerability of two senolytic regimens to reduce markers of cellular senescence (primary outcome: p16\^INK4a) and improve frailty (primary outcome: walking speed) in adult survivors of childhood cancer. If successful, this pilot would provide the preliminary evidence needed for a phase 2, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to establish efficacy.

Primary Objective

* The primary aim of this proposal is to test the efficacy of two, short duration senolytic regimens: 1) combination of Dasatinib plus Quercetin and 2) Fisetin alone, to improve walking speed and decrease senescent cell abundance in blood (p16\^INKA):
* Primary endpoints of this trial will be change in walking speed and senescent cell abundance in blood (p16\^INK4A) determined at baseline and again at 60 days, within an individual arm. Extended follow up at 150 days will assess the permanence of change after completion of the trial. Secondary endpoints of this trial will be effect of intervention on additional measures of frailty (beyond walking speed; Fried criteria) and on other cell senescence markers, markers of inflammation, insulin resistance, bone resorption, and cognitive function.

Secondary Objectives

The secondary aim is to test the safety and tolerability of two different senolytic therapies.

Exploratory Objectives

* To compare the efficacy of the two senolytic regimens in improving walking speed and decreasing senescent cell abundance
* To evaluate the longitudinal pattern in measures of frailty.

Eligible subjects who meet inclusion criteria will be randomized, stratified on sex, 1:1 and age ( â‰¥40 vs \< 40) to receive Dasatinib (100 mg/day) plus Quercetin (500 mg twice daily) on days 1, 2, 3, 30, 31, and 32 taken orally or Fisetin (20 mg/kg/day) alone on days 1, 2, 30 and 31 taken orally. At the visit on day 7, we will assess blood CD3+ T lymphocyte p16\^INK4A mRNA and other markers of inflammation and senescence to verify that senescent cells have been cleared by the intervention. Post-treatment follow-up will occur on day 60 (primary endpoints) and day 150 to assess the permanence of change after completion of the trial. Treatment adherence will be confirmed by the study coordinator who will administer the Dasatinib + Quercetin in clinic on days 1, 2, 3, 30, 31, and 32 or Fisetin alone on days 1, 2, 30 and 31.
