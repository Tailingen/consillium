ctDNA Methylation Sequencing for Myeloma
1. To carry out research on minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) based on plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) methylation sequencing, which aims to explore new MRD detection methods for MM;
2. Carry out ctDNA-based methylation sequencing in newly diagnosed, remission, and, relapsed MM patients, to track the clonal evolution patterns; and explore the in the initial diagnosis-remission-relapse stage of MM, track the clonal evolution characteristics of methylation profiles in MM patients during the disease progression.
