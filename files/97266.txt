18F-Fluorocholine (18F-FCho) to Distinguish Necrosis From Recurrence in Brain Metastases
The main purpose of this study is to determine the distribution of 18F Fluorocholine (18F-FCH) in the brain which can help distinguishing radiation-induced scarring from tumor regrowth. In addition, the study will measure levels of 18F-FCH in the blood and (if applicable) in the brain lesion tissue that is removed as part of the planned brain surgery.
