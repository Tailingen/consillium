Clinical Trial of Lung Cancer Chemoprevention With Sulforaphane in Former Smokers
This research study involves taking an experimental anti-cancer dietary supplement called Sulforaphane (SF) or a placebo (product without any supplement content) over a period of twelve months in order to determine if it is a useful dietary supplement for prevention of lung cancer in humans.

The main goals of this research study are:

1. To learn about the effects of giving Sulforaphane (SF) to former smokers who are still at high risk of developing cancer due to their smoking history and whether or not their condition improves, stays the same or becomes worse after Sulforaphane (SF) is given.
2. To learn whether Sulforaphane (SF) might reverse some of the lung cell changes associated with future development of lung cancer.

Change From Baseline in Bronchial Dysplasia Index at 12 Months, To explore if daily oral dose of 120 micromole SF can modulate the changes in bronchial dysplasia from endoscopic biopsies in former smokers at high risk for lung cancer. All bronchial biopsies were formalin fixed, paraffin embedded, and H\&E stained for subsequent morphologic evaluation and classification defined by the World Health Organization The scale to score the biopsy: 1= normal; 2= reserve cell hyperplasia; 3 = squamous metaplasia; 4 = mild dysplasia; 5 = moderate dysplasia; 6 = severe dysplasia; 7 = carcinoma in situ; and 8 = invasive carcinoma. The higher the score the worse the possible outcome., 12 months|Cell Proliferation Marker Ki-67, The primary outcome focuses on the changes of bronchial dysplasia index with cell proliferation marker Ki-67. The determination if a daily oral dose of 120 micromole SF for 12 months can modulate the changes of bronchial dysplasia index, cell proliferation marker Ki-67. Besides the inhibition of tumor incidence and multiplicity, the use of sulforaphane can inhibit cellular proliferation markers such as Ki-67 and induction of apoptosis hallmarks of tumorigenesis. Ki-67 will be quantified as % positive cells in two slides of each tissue block. First, we calculate the average values of each of the 3 IHC markers over 6 tissue blocks within each bronchoscopy per patient separately for pre- and post-treatment. The primary analysis for these continuous measures will be a linear regression predicting post-treatment score by treatment group, controlling for pre-treatment score., 12 months|Apoptosis Marker TUNEL, The determination if a daily oral dose of 120 micromole SF for 12 months can modulate the changes of bronchial dysplasia index, in apoptosis marker TUNEL in bronchial biopsies in former smokers at high risk for lung cancer. TUNEL will be quantified as % positive cells in two slides of each tissue block. First, we calculate the average values of each of the 3 IHC markers over 6 tissue blocks within each bronchoscopy per patient separately for pre- and post-treatment. The primary analysis for these continuous measures will be a linear regression predicting post-treatment score by treatment group, controlling for pre-treatment score., 12 months|Apoptosis Marker Caspase-3, The determination if a daily oral dose of 120 micromole SF for 12 months can modulate the changes of bronchial dysplasia index, in apoptosis marker Caspase-3 in bronchial biopsies in former smokers at high risk for lung cancer. Caspase-3 will be quantified as % positive cells in two slides of each tissue block. First, we calculate the average values of each of the 3 IHC markers over 6 tissue blocks within each bronchoscopy per patient separately for pre- and post-treatment. The primary analysis for these continuous measures will be a linear regression predicting post-treatment score by treatment group, controlling for pre-treatment score., 12 months
Upregulated Genes Associated With Lung Cancer Risk in Bronchial Brushing Samples, Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) algorithm was used to calculate gene set enrichment scores in bronchial brushing samples. If a gene is upregulated in lung cancer (LC) tissue, the inhibitory effect of sulforaphane (SFN) treatment on such genes suggests a protective effect against LC., 12 Months|Downregulated Genes Associated With Lung Cancer Risk in Bronchial Brushing Samples, Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) algorithm was used to calculate gene set enrichment scores in bronchial brushing samples. If a gene is downregulated in LC, the enhancing effect of sulforaphane (SFN) treatment on such genes suggests a protective effect against LC., 12 months|Upregulated Genes Associated With Lung Pre-Malignant Lesions (PML) in Bronchial Brushing Samples, GSVA algorithm was used to calculate gene set enrichment scores in bronchial brushing samples. If a gene is upregulated in lung pre-malignant lesions (PML), the inhibitory effect of sulforaphane (SFN) treatment on such genes suggests a protective effect against PML., 12 months|Downregulated Genes Associated With Lung Pre-malignant Lesions (PML) in Bronchial Brushing Samples, GSVA algorithm was used to calculate gene set enrichment scores in bronchial brushing samples.

The severity is calculated by five grades: 1=mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe, 4 = life threatening, 5 = death.
