Implementation of the Families Accelerating Cascade Testing Toolkit (FACTT) for Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer and Lynch Syndrome
The purpose of this research study is to learn how cancer care providers can help their patients communicate the need for genetic testing in families with inherited cancer syndromes.
Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer|Lynch Syndrome
OTHER: Families Accelerating Cascade Testing Toolkit
Proband-reported cascade testing rates of first-degree relatives, -For each proband, this testing rate is defined as the number of first-degree relatives tested divided by the number of living first-degree relatives age-appropriate for testing, as determined by family surveys done by the proband. The investigators will calculate mean cascade genetic testing rates for both conditions (Usual Care and FACTT intervention)., From start of study through completion of 6 month follow-up (estimated to be 18 months)|Number of primary barriers to genetic testing for first-degree relatives, -The Cascade Genetic Testing survey will assess knowledge, perception, and personal experience with sharing germline mutation information with first-degree relatives, From start of study through completion of 6 month follow-up (estimated to be 18 months)|Family member-reported cascade testing rates, -This testing rate is defined by the number of family members tested divided by the number of living family members age-appropriate for testing, From start of study through completion of 6 month follow-up (estimated to be 18 months)|Number of primary barriers to genetic testing for family members, -The Family Member survey will assess experience with considering testing themselves, decisional regret regarding genetic testing, and if they have tested positive, From start of study through completion of 6 month follow-up (estimated to be 18 months)
