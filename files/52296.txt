Polatuzumab Vedotin in Patients With Relapsed and Refractory Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma
This study enrolled patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma treated with polatuzumab vedotin-based chemoimmunotherapies. Patients were allowed to use chemotherapy regimens other than Rituximab and Bendamustine and transplantation following polatuzumab vedotin was also allowed.
Relapsed Non Hodgkin Lymphoma|Refractory Lymphoma
Overall Survival, From the use of PoV to death related to any cause, through study completion, an average of 2 year
Overall response rate, The assessment is based on PET/CT or contrast CT, as determined by the investigator. Including complete remission and partial remission, through study completion, an average of 2 year|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability], Will estimate the safety and tolerability of polatuzumab vedotin when added to intensive chemotherapy regimens, through study completion, an average of 2 year
Polatuzumab vedotin has been demonstrated to be an effective treatment for patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma in an international phase II clinical trial. The clinical trials was conducted in Europe and the United States. Although there is a phase III trial about polatuzumab vedotin in newly diagnosed patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma, the double-blind design has limited the efficacy assessment and side effect observation, making it difficult to provide clinicians with further information.

This program hopes to evaluate the clinical course and treatment response of these patients in order to facilitate clinicians' understanding of this drug and to improve patients' quality of life and medical care, as well as to prevent the occurrence of related complications and treatment toxicity.
