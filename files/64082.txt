Treatment Patterns in Metastatic Prostate Cancer
This study will evaluate treatment patterns, mortality, healthcare resource utilization, and costs in patients with prostate cancer with bone metastases (primary objectives). Additionally, this study will evaluate opioid/analgesic use among lines of therapy in this patient population (secondary objective). The study is descriptive in nature and is meant to provide a greater understanding of the patterns of therapy observed in real-world clinical practice (in the absence of clear guideline recommendations with regards to treatment sequencing), to contribute to a greater understanding of the major cost drivers (thus better-informing payers), and to examine real-world mortality in such patients.
