Identification of Pre-Malignant Lesions In Pediatric Patients With Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Using Novel Magnetic Resonance Imaging Techniques Paired With Artificial Intelligence
This is a single arm pilot trial of a novel whole-body Magnetic Resonance Imaging paired with artificial intelligence intervention, to evaluate feasibility defined as scan-rescan reliability, and to estimate the positive predictive value of changes in Magnetic Resonance Imaging scans from baseline to 12-month visit using an Artificial Intelligence algorithm, among 15 pediatric patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.
Neurofibromatosis Type 1
OTHER: Whole-body Magnetic Resonance Imaging
For scan re-scan reliability, utilize T2 imaging to evaluate the agreement between the baseline scan and the 1 Month scan, which is performed within 4 weeks of the baseline scan., T2 is a type of high-resolution multiparametric tissue mapping that measures quantitative metrics of the physical properties of tissue and allows comparison in longitudinal follow-up, From Baseline to within 4 weeks of baseline
For change over time, the initial scan imaging using T1 and apparent diffusion coefficient (ACD) imaging, the baseline scan will be compared to the third scan, which is performed 12 months (+/- 3 months) after the baseline scan., T1 and ACD is a type of high-resolution multiparametric tissue mapping that measures quantitative metrics of the physical properties of tissue and allows comparison in longitudinal follow-up, From Baseline to 12 months
