Safety and Efficacy of Tremelimumab+Durvalumab(MEDI4736)+TACE in Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Safety and Efficacy Evaluation of Tremelimumab Plus Durvalumab(MEDI4736) in Combination with Concurrent Transarterial Chemoembolization in Unresectable Hepatocellular carcinoma
Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)|Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: Tremelimumab Plus Durvalumab (MEDI4736)|PROCEDURE: Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE)
PFS, The primary endpoint for evaluating progression-free survival (PFS) will be assessed through RECIST 1.1 evaluation., the time from the first study treatment administration until the date of objective disease progression
OS, Overall Survival (OS) from first dose of study drug until the time of data cut-off, as determined by the Investigator., the time from the first study treatment administration until death due to any cause, regardless of whether the patient withdraws from therapy or receives another anticancer therapy.|ORR, Objective Response Rate (ORR) of Target Lesion(s) and Non-Target Lesion(s), From date of enrollment until the date of first documented progression, assessed every 8 weeks up to 12 months.|TTP, Time to progression (TTP) of enrollment to disease progression as assessed by RECIST 1.1 and mRECIST., the time from the first study treatment administration until the first confirmed tumor progression (PD) based on the RECIST 1.1 assessment.|Safety of durvalumab and tremelimumab in terms of the occurrence of adverse events, changes from baseline in vital signs (blood pressure and heart rate), and safety laboratory findings (chemistry, hematology, and so on), Until 30 days after TACE or the last dose of tremelimumab and/or durvalumab
The purpose of this clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tremelimumab + durvalumab administered concurrently with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in patients diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who are not eligible for curative liver resection.

Primary Objective:

The primary objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) from the time of registration using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.

Secondary Objectives:

Overall Survival (OS):

To assess the overall survival from the first dose of the study drug until the data cutoff point, as determined by the investigator.

Objective Response Rate (ORR):

To assess the objective response rate of target and non-target lesions using mRECIST and RECIST 1.1. Evaluations will occur every 8 weeks after 12 weeks and for the first 48 weeks from the time of registration, and then every 12 weeks thereafter.

Time to Progression (TTP):

To measure the time from registration to disease progression using mRECIST and RECIST 1.1.

Safety Evaluation:

To evaluate the safety of tremelimumab and durvalumab, including adverse events, vital signs (blood pressure and pulse rate), and laboratory safety assessments (clinical chemistry, hematology, etc.), by assessing changes from baseline.
