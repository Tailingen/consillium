A Clinical Trial of a New Combination Treatment, Domvanalimab and Zimberelimab, Plus Chemotherapy, for People With an Upper Gastrointestinal Tract Cancer That Cannot be Removed With Surgery That Has Spread to Other Parts of the Body
This randomized Phase 3 open-label study will compare the efficacy of the T-cell immunoglobulin and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) domain (TIGIT) monoclonal antibody domvanalimab, the anti programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibody zimberelimab, and multiagent chemotherapy versus the anti PD-1 monoclonal antibody nivolumab and multiagent chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of participants with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic gastric, gastroesophageal junction (GEJ), and esophageal adenocarcinoma.

Overall survival, From date of randomization until date of death from any cause (Approximately 15 months)]
