Effects of Laugh-yoga Intervention on Mood and Quality of Life Among Oncologic Patients in a Oncologic Clinic Setting.
Previous studies report low levels of mood and of quality of life among cancer patients. Laugh has been proved to improve mood and immune system function. The investigators propose to assess in a prospective randomised case-control study the affects of laugh-yoga intervention on mood levels and quality of life among cancer patients in a cancer clinic. The main hypothesis is that patients in laugh-yoga group will report higher mood and quality o life levels after intervention in comparison with no-intervention group. The second hypothesis is that immune system is the mediator of the effects of laugh-yoga intervention on mood and quality of life.
