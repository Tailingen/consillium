Complete Response Rate (CRR), Response is assessed according to the 2014 lugano criteria.Percentage of participants with complete response was determined on 2014 Lugano criteria., 3 years
Overall Response Rate (ORR), Response is assessed according to the 2014 lugano criteria.The total percentage of patients with complete response（CR ）and partial response（PR)., 3 years|Progression-Free-Survival (PFS), From the time subjects were enrolled to the time of disease progression (in any way) or death from any cause.Progression-free survival (PFS) was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier method, and 95% bilateral confidence intervals were calculated., 3 years|Duration of Response (DOR), The time between meeting the criteria for treatment effectiveness (first recorded complete or partial response) and the first clear recurrence or progression.Duration of response (DoR) was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier method, and 95% bilateral confidence intervals were calculated., 3 years|Overall survival (OS), From the date of inclusion to date of death, irrespective of cause.Overall survival (OS) was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier method, and 95% bilateral confidence intervals were calculated., 3 years|Progression of disease within 2 years(POD24), The rate of patients with disease progression within 24 months of receiving first-line treatment at the start of enrollment., 3 years|Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), The safety of the drug was evaluated by NCI-CTC AE 5.0 standard.Hematologic and non-hematologic toxicity.To identify the incidence of TEAEs with NCI-CTC AE 5.0 standard., From the initiation of the first dose to 28 days after the last dose|Changes in cardiac safety indicators, The change value of LVEF% from baseline, and its mean, median, standard deviation, maximum and minimum values were statistically described., 3 years
This is a single-arm, open label, multi-center clinical study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of mitoxantrone hydrochloride liposome in combination with Cyclophosphamide, Vincristine, Prednisone and/or Rituximab(CMOP±R) in patients with newly diagnosed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Mitoxantrone hydrochloride liposome will be given on day 1 at dose of 18 mg/m2 and be combined with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone and/or Rituximab. Each cycle consists of 28 days. A maximum of 8 cycles(6×CMOP±R+2×R) of therapy are planned.
