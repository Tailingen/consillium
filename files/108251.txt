Monitoring the Changes of Tumor-related Biomarkers Before and After Pulmonary Nodule Biopsy.
In the past few years, circulating tumor cells (CTCs), circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), microRNAs, autoantibodies, and T-cell receptor repertoire are new biomarkers of liquid biopsy in cancer, which has been demonstrated to have a great value in diagnostics, treatment evaluation, and prognosis prediction. However, most of previous data were based on late stage tumor patients. This study plans to utilize the minimally invasive method to detect the changes of numbers of CTCs, ctDNA hot spot mutations and methylation signals, microRNAs, autoantibodies, and T-cell receptor repertoire in early stage lung cancer patients before and after pulmonary nodule biopsy, during therapeutic and follow-up periods, in order to evaluate the clinical values of above tumor-related biomarkers.
