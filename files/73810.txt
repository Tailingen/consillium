Pilot Study of Imatinib Cetuximab Combo for H & N Cancer
The goal of this clinical trial is to find if levels of a protein called AXL in tumor cells relate to how tumors respond to cetuximab (CTX) combined with imatinib in participants with head and neck cancer. This interventional study will occur in the time between diagnosis of your cancer and surgery to remove your tumor or radiation or chemoradiation treatment of your primary cancer.

Participants will undergo a research blood draw and a research biopsy as part of the screening process, and will be in this research study for approximately 13 to 16 months.
Head and Neck Cancer|Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck
DRUG: Cetuximab|DRUG: Imatinib
Change in Ki67 from pre- versus post-imatinib/cetuximab treated tumors, The change in Ki67 is calculated as the ratio of pre- to post- treatment Ki67 index, 6 months after last research biopsy
Adverse Events that are probably related to CTX and imatinib prior to the start of definitive concurrent chemoradiation therapy or surgical resection, Count of adverse events that are probably related to the regimen, Through study completion, an average of 2 years|Rate of hospital re-admissions, For subjects undergoing definitive surgical resection, rate of hospital re-admissions for wound care or surgical complications attributed to imatinib plus cetuximab (such as fistula or deep cellulitis) within 28 days after surgery, Up to 28 days after surgery|Objective response rate (ORR), Measured by clinical examination, Diagnosis, 48 hours prior to surgery or radiation|Objective response rate (ORR), Measured by clinical measurements, Diagnosis, 48 hours prior to surgery or radiation
This is a 'window of opportunity' pilot study of oral imatinib (400 mg per day) plus cetuximab (CTX) (400mg/m2 loading dose \[dose 1\] and 250mg/m2 \[dose 2\]) for patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) undergoing definitive surgery or radiation for treatment of their cancer. The primary objective is to determine the proportion of patients with a response to imatinib plus CTX in pre-treatment and post-treatment samples obtained as part of a window of opportunity clinical study in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients.
