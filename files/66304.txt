A Study of Multiple Immunotherapy-Based Treatment Combinations in Participants With Metastatic Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (Morpheus-Pancreatic Cancer)
A Phase Ib/II, open-label, multicenter, randomized study designed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary anti-tumor activity of immunotherapy-based treatment combinations in participants with metastatic Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC).

Two cohorts will be enrolled in parallel in this study: Cohort 1 will consist of patients who have received no prior systemic therapy for metastatic PDAC, and Cohort 2 will consist of patients who have received one line of prior systemic therapy for PDAC. In each cohort, eligible patients will be assigned to one of several treatment arms.
