Recombinant Human Endostatin(Rh-endostatin) Combine With Radiotherapy in the Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma(HCC)
Hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) is a high malignancy cancer which progress rapidly , and the rates of morbidity and mortality is very high in China. Radiotherapy as a effective treatment is commonly used in unresectable HCC patients. Preclinical models have shown that anti-angiogenesis medicine,such as rh-endostatin, can normalize the tumor vasculature to make it more efficient for oxygen delivery, which can enhance the radiosensitivity subsequently. This study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of rh-endostatin combined with radiotherapy in the treatment of HCC.
