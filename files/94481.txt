Intravenous Iron Infusion on Chemotherapy-induced Anemia
FOLFOX, the first-line regimen based on 5-FU and oxaliplatin, is adjuvant chemotherapy for pathologic stage II/III colorectal cancer patients. Among various side effects of FOLFOX, chemotherapy-induced anemia occurs in about 30% of patients with FOLFOX chemotherapy. An oral iron supplement is a widely accepted treatment for chemotherapy-induced anemia, but an oral iron supplement has a lot of inconveniences that can make patients' adherence worse, such as gastrointestinal discomfort, a long period of oral intake, and late recovery of serum iron level.

Intravenous iron infusion has been recently reported to be effective and safe to correct anemia. Previous studies reported that intravenous iron is also effective to correct chemotherapy-induced anemia. However, there is a paucity of studies associated with colorectal cancer patients with FOLFOX chemotherapy.

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of intravenous iron on chemotherapy-induced anemia after FOLFOX chemotherapy for patients with colorectal cancer compared with the effect of oral iron supplements. Parameters including serum Hb, serum iron, serum ferritin concentrations, total iron-binding capacity, absolute neutrophil count, platelet, albumin, C reactive protein, hepcidin, soluble transferrin receptor, and IL6 will be analyzed. In addition, information on chemotoxicity, adverse events during chemotherapy and quality of life will be collected and analyzed.
