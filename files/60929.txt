cDC1 Prognostic and Predictive Role in Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Patients Receiving Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors
The response rate of immune checkpoint inhibitors remains relatively low and the identification of the new predictive biomarkers is necessary. The rare population of cDC1 is very interesting, as its mouse counterparts is essential for the cross presentation of tumor-associated antigens, tumor immunity and response to immunotherapies. Their role in humans has not been studied. This proposal aims to study the prognostic role of cDC1 in a cohort of patients with advanced NSCLC, possibly demonstrating their positive predictive value of immune checkpoint inhibitors response.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
OTHER: This is a non-interventional study
Progression free survival (PFS), To validate the cDC1 infiltration as predictive biomarker of pembrolizumab response, 1 year
Overall response rate (ORR), To compare the overall response rate (ORR) of cDC1-positive patients to cDC1 negative ones within those treated with pembrolizumab and on the entire cohort, 1 year|Time to treatment failure (TTF), To compare the time of treatment failure (TTF) on CDC1-positive patients to negatives ones within those treated with pembrolizumaband on the entire cohort, 1 year
Overall survival (OS), To compare the overall survival (OS) of cDC1-positives patients to negatives ones within those treated with pembrolozumab and on the entire cohort, 1 year
Multicenter study aiming to collect patient's clinical data retrospectively and their histological samples prospectively.

The cohort will include:

* 30 patients PD-L1 \> 50% treated with pembrolizumab in first line and having a progression free survival â‰¥ 3 months
* 30 patients PD-L1 \> 50% treated with pembrolizumab in first line and having a progression free survival \< 3 months
* 30 patients PD-L1 \< 50% treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy in first line
