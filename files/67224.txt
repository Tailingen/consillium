Exemestane in Combination With Fulvestrant in Postmenopausal Women With Hormone Sensitive Advanced Breast Cancer
The purpose of this trial is to evaluate time to progression in women with hormone responsive advanced breast cancer treated with a combination of exemestane and fulvestrant.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Exemestane|DRUG: Fulvestrant
Time to Progression (TTP) in Women With Hormone Responsive Advanced Breast Cancer Treated With Combination of Exemestane and Fulvestrant., TTP is defined as the time from first treatment to objective evidence of progression on the basis of radiological evaluation and/or physical exam (if physical examination identifies a site of measurable disease). Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions, Every 2 cycles up to 2 years
Overall Clinical Benefit (Complete Response Rate, Partial Response and Stable Disease), Response and progression was evaluated after every 2 cycles by physical examination and imaging studies using the international RECIST criteria.

Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), Overall Response Rate (ORR), Stable Disease (SD), Progressive Disease (PD). Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI and/or CT: Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD), neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for a Partial Response nor sufficient increase to qualify for Progressive Disease (PD); PD, 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions; Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Overall Response Rate (ORR), CR+PR, Every 2 cycles, up to 1 year|Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of Exemestane When Administered Alone and With Fulvestrant, 5 mL of venous whole blood was obtained before dosing and then at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours after exemestane ingestion on each of the 2 time points., Day 7 and Day 120|Examine the Effect of Exemestane + Fulvestrant on Serum IGF-1 and IGFPB-3 Levels, Prestudy, Day 7 and Day 120
The purpose of this trial is to evaluate time to progression in women with hormone responsive advanced breast cancer treated with a combination of exemestane and fulvestrant.
