Combination of Local Therapy and Target Therapy for Brain Metastases With EGFR Mutation
The goal of this observational study is to learn about the survival benefit of local therapy combination with target therapy in lung cancer brain metastases with EGFR mutation. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Is local therapy performed before or after target therapy would provide survival benefit ?
* What kind of local therapy combining with target therapy would provide survival benefit, neurosurgical resection or radiotherapy?
Brain Metastases
OTHER: Surgery or Radiotherapy|OTHER: before or after target therapy
OS, Overall survival, From date of first follow-up until the date of documented death from any cause, assessed up to 120 months
PFS, Progression-free survival, From date of first follow-up until the date of first documented progression, assessed up to 120 months
