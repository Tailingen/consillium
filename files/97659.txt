Developing a Shared Decision Making Tool for Patients With Surgically Removed Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This study observes conversations between non-small cell lung cancer patients and their doctors to support the development of a decision aid that can be used to inform discussions about treatment options for after surgery. Patients who have undergone surgery for their non-small cell lung cancer may have the option of completing additional treatment. Patients contemplating this additional treatment have been shown to be most satisfied with their choice if they perceive an effort by their doctor to share decision making. Shared decision making tools can help doctors guide conversations, offer tailored recommendations, and support deliberation on whether or not to pursue treatment. This study develops a shared decision making tool for patients with surgically removed non-small cell lung cancer contemplating additional treatment.
Lung Non-Small Cell Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: Discussion|OTHER: Questionnaire Administration
Development of decision aid, Up to study completion, up to 2 years
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To develop, in close collaboration with stakeholders, an evidence-based decision aid to inform discussions regarding options for adjuvant treatment in patients with resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCL) (NSCL adjuvant choice).

OUTLINE:

Patient and clinician discussions are observed to support refinement of a decision aid. Clinicians may use a prototype of the decision aid in discussions with their patients and may complete a questionnaire.
