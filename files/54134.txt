A Study of DC-CIK Immunotherapy in the Treatment of Solid Tumors
Main purpose of this study is through comparing with the external control, evaluation of autologous D - CIK cells immunotherapy to finish after conventional treatment of liver cancer, renal clear cell carcinoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, lung cancer, colon cancer, breast cancer patients with the clinical efficacy and safety of study population, including clinical liver, renal clear cell carcinoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, lung cancer, colon cancer, breast cancer after conventional treatment (surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy) patients.The primary outcome measures were overall survival and progression-free survival, while the secondary outcome measures were overall response rate and quality of life.

OS and PFS, Overall survival and progression-free survival, The enrollment period was 3 years and the follow-up period was 5 years
ORR, CR+PR, Overall response rate and quality of life, The enrollment period was 3 years and the follow-up period was 5 years
This is a single center, single arm phase II clinical research, to evaluate the self D - CIK cells to treat liver cancer, renal clear cell carcinoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, lung cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer patient safety and efficacy of plan participants included 1372 cases of the subjects, experimental group 686 cases, control group 686 cases, control group adopts the liver, renal clear cell carcinoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, lung cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer patients after conventional treatment (surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy) did not receive D - CIK cell therapy of external control
