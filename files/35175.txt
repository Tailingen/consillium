Monitoring Alectinib Treatment by Detection of ALK Translocations in Serial Blood Samples From Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients
Circulating tumor DNA can be used to monitor the treatment effect and identify developing resistance mutations during ALK directed TKI treatment.
Lung Cancer|ALK Gene Mutation|Resistance, Disease|Mutation
DRUG: Alectinib
PFS on alectinib, time from initiation of treatment to progression, 46 month|mechanism of resistance, ctDNA to establish resistance mechanisms to alectinib treatment, 15.2 month
The purpose and objectives of the non-interventional study with primary data collection is

* To determine if monitoring the amount of translocated DNA in the blood reflects alectinib treatment effect.
* To assess the presence and type of resistance mutations using ctDNA at the time patients experience clinical progression on alectinib.
* To investigate if the resistance mutations identified at clinical progression could have been identified in blood samples taken before clinically evident progression.
