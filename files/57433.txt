A Novel Lung Function Imaging Modality As a Preoperative Evaluation Tool (LIME)
To evaluate the correlation between pre-surgical 4DCT-ventilation imaging and post-surgical lung function.
Lung Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: 4DCT-Ventilation
Pre-Surgical Imaging and Post-Surgical Lung Function, Measure the correlation between pre-surgical 4-Dimensional Computed Tomography-ventilation (4DCT) imaging and post surgical lung function using a Percent Predicted Post-Operative Pulmonary Function Test (%PPO PFT)., Baseline visit to follow up visit, up to 9 months.
Ability of %PPO PFTs, Use %PPO PFTs to determine if 4DCT-ventilation is a better predictor of post surgical lung function than nuclear medicine imaging, Start of study to end of study, up to 2 years|Quality of Life (QOL), Use QOL questionnaires to determine if 4DCT-ventilation is a better predictor of post surgical lung function than nuclear medicine imaging., Start of study to end of study, up to 2 years|Cost-Effectiveness, Determine the cost-effectiveness of 4DCT-ventialtion and VQ scans for pre-surgical assessment using Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) analysis., Start of study to end of study, up to 2 years|Longitudinal Imaging Changes, Derive novel post-surgical prediction formulas using longitudinal 4DCT-ventilation imaging, Start of study to end of study, up to 2 years
To evaluate the correlation between pre-surgical 4-Dimensional Computed Tomography-ventilation (4DCT-ventilation) imaging and post-surgical lung function. To determine whether 4DCT-ventilation is a better predictor of post-surgical lung function than nuclear medicine imaging using pulmonary function tests (PFTs). To determine whether 4DCT-ventilation is a better predictor of post-surgical lung function than nuclear medicine imaging using quality of life (QOL) questionnaires. Evaluate cost-effectiveness of using 4DCT-ventialtion and VQ scans for pre-surgical assessment. To use longitudinal (pre and post-surgical) 4DCT-ventilation imaging to derive novel post-surgical prediction formulas.
