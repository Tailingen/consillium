A Study Combining LY2157299 With Temozolomide-based Radiochemotherapy in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Malignant Glioma
The purpose of this trial is to show proof of concept that by blocking the Transforming Growth Factor-beta signaling pathway in patients with Glioblastoma, there will be clinical benefit.

Phase 1b: To determine the safe and tolerable dose of LY2157299 in combination with radiochemotherapy with temozolomide for Phase 2 in patients with glioma eligible to receive radiochemotherapy with temozolomide (e.g. newly diagnosed malignant glioma World Health Organization Grade III and IV).

Phase 2a: To confirm the tolerability and evaluate the pharmacodynamic effect of LY2157299 in combination with standard radiochemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.
