Thalidomide in Combination With Capecitabine in Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer
The lack of non-overlapping toxicities between the two drugs, the ease of all oral drug administration, and the possibility for antitumor synergy make exploration of this combination regimen attractive in women with previously treated metastatic breast cancer. This phase II trial will be performed in collaboration with the Minnie Pearl Cancer Research Network, a multicenter, community-based clinical trials group.
