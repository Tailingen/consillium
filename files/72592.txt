A Trial of MLN2704 in Subjects With Metastatic Androgen Independent Prostate Cancer
This is the first study of MLN2704 administered to humans. The purpose of the study is to determine the highest dose of MLN2704 that can be given safely to patients with prostate cancer, and to identify any side effects associated with taking the drug. This study will also evaluate how MLN2704 is taken up (absorbed), broken down (metabolized) and eliminated (excreted) by the body. This process is called pharmacokinetic analysis.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: MLN2704 (DM1 conjugated monoclonal antibody MLN591)
This is a Phase 1 open-label dose-escalating trial designed to determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and pharmacokinetics of a single dose of MLN2704 in subjects with metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer.
