Lymphedema Sensor Technology Development Study
The goal of this clinical trial in adult patients diagnosed with upper extremity lymphedema is to test the safety and effectiveness of small, wearable sensors that may be able to measure lymphedema. The main questions this study aims to answer are:

* Do these sensors detect lymphedema?
* If so, how accurate are these wearable sensors?

Participants will complete one in-person measurement session and one phone call with study staff 14 days after the measurement session to check-in on the participant's well-being.

DEVICE: Wearable devices to detect lymphedema
Tissue Hydration Score Recorded from the Tissue Hydration Sensor, This score will determine whether or not fluid associated with lymphedema is detected when compared to previously validated measures (bioimpedance spectroscopy and tissue dielectric constant)., From enrollment to the end of the measurement session (appx. 3 hours)|Tissue Stiffness Score from the Tissue Stiffness Sensor, This score will determine whether or not tissue affected by lymphedema can yield is detected when compared to a comparable clinical measurement device using Young's Modulus., From enrollment to the end of the measurement session (appx. 3 hours)
Bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) L-Dex score, The bioimpedance spectroscopy L-Dex score is a ratio that represents the difference in the amount of extracellular fluid in an at-risk limb compared to an unaffected limb., Three hours|Tissue Dielectric Constant (TDC), The tissue dielectric constant (TDC) is derived from an electromagnetic wave that is reflected back from transmission into the tissue. It represents free and bound water in the tissue., From enrollment to the end of the measurement session (appx. 3 hours)|Volume of the Upper Extremities, Circumferential volumetric measurement is obtained by modeling the limb as a frustum and taking a series of circumferential measurements using anatomical landmarks at predetermined intervals (typically every 4cm), beginning at the wrist and ending at the anterior axillary fold. Volume differences of +10% represents the presence of lymphedema., Three hours
