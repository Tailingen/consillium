Assessment of the Impact of RNA Genomic Profile on Treatment Decision-making in HER2 Equivocal Breast Cancer Patients
The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the /College of American Pathologists (CAP) recommend that HER2 status (negative or positive) must be determined in all patients with invasive breast cancer. The knowledge of HER2 status will help the oncologist in prescribing or not a HER2-targeted therapy to patients. Presently, two main methods are used to assess HER2 status: immunohistochemistry (IHC, protein expression) and in situ hybridization (ISH, gene expression) in order to classify tumor sample as positive, negative or equivocal. When a tumor is classified HER 2+ by IHC method, a second test is performed using ISH methods (FISH, SISH, CISH). In case of HER2 equivocal result with ISH method (4 ≤HER2 gene number copy \<6), the patient is eligible to an anti-HER2 therapy after discussed during MD-MM. This decision should be individualized on the basis of patient status (comorbidities and prognosis) and patient preferences after discussing available clinical evidence.

Based on molecular classification, RNA expression could help to discriminate breast cancer subtypes (luminal A, luminal B, HER2-overexpressed and triple negative). Prosigna is a genomic test, developed by NanoString® based on the PAM50 gene signature, which measures the expression of 50 genes to classify tumors into 1 of 4 intrinsic subtypes and could allow determining the HER2 status.

This study was designed in order to define if such a test could help the oncologist to define the better therapeutic decision in a HER2 equivocal population. In addition, concordance tests will be performed. The aim of this study is to assess the modification decision rate between the first and the second multidisciplinary decision-making meeting in HER2 equivocal patients using genomic testing.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: PAM 50 test
The modification of therapeutical decision between the first and the second multidisciplinary decision-making meeting (MD-MM) using a genomic testing, Percentage of therapeutical strategy changes between the first and the second multidisciplinary decision-making meetings., The measure will be realised after the second multidisciplinary decision-making meeting that is about one month after patient's inclusion.
The HER2 overexpression incidence according to RNA genomic profile among equivocal-HER2 patients, Percentage of HER2 classified patients using a genomic test among equivocal-HER2 patients, The measure will be done when the genomic test is realised, that is about three weeks after patient's inclusion.|The concordance between the second multidisciplinary decision-making meeting decision and the HER2 genomic test result, Percentage of second multidisciplinary decision-making meeting decision in accordance with genomic test result and reasons justifying discrepancies (check-list and comments), The measure will be done when the genomic test is realised, that is about three weeks after patient's inclusion.
To compare results from different ISH methods used, Comparison between all ISH (FISH, SISH, CISH, or DDISH) methods based upon the HER2-eligible classification (Wolff et al 2013), The measure will be done when the genomic test is realised, that is about three weeks after patient's inclusion..|The concordance between local and centralized anatomopathologist HER2 status, Concordance between local and centralized anatomopathologist HER2 status., The measure will be done when the genomic test is realised,that is about three weeks after patient's inclusion.
