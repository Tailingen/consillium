An RCT to Compare Early Continence Recovery After RARP With or Without Sustainable Functional Urethral Reconstruction
The study is a prospective randomized controlled trail to compare early urinary continence recovery after robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy with or without sustainable functional urethral reconstruction (SFUR).
Prostate Cancer|Urinary Incontinence
PROCEDURE: SFUR-RARP|PROCEDURE: Standard RARP
1-month urinary continence recovery rates, Continence defined as daily usage of 0-1 pad with 24-hour pad weights≤50g., 1 month after catheter removal
Short-term urinary continence recovery, Two definitions of urinary continence: daily usage of 0-1 pad with 24-hour pad weights gain≤50g, 0 pads per day. Besides, quantification of urine leakage with 24-hour pad weight., Within 3 month after catheter removal|Peri and postoperative complications, Clavien-Dindo classification., 1-year follow up|Post-operative oncological outcomes, Two assessment methods: positive surgical margin (PSM) rates and 1-year biochemical recurrence-free survival (BFS, defined as two consecutive PSA levels\>0.2 ng/mL)., 1-year follow up|Short-term urinary function and urinary function-related quality of life, International Prostatic Symptom Score(IPSS) and the IPSS quality of life score., 1-week, 2-week, 1-month, 3-month after catheter removal.
1-year urinary continence recovery, Two definitions of urinary continence: daily usage of 0-1 pad with 24-hour pad weights gain≤50g, 0 pads per day., 1-year from the intervention|1-year urinary function and urinary function-related quality of life, International Prostatic Symptom Score(IPSS) and the IPSS quality of life score., 1-year from the intervention|Evaluation of urinary continence with ICIQ-UI-SF, International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence-Short Form (ICIQ-UI-SF)., 1-week, 2-week, 1-month, 3-month after catheter removal|Post-operative sexual function, Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) score \>=17., 1-year from the intervention
Early urinary incontinence has always been a tricky problem for both patients and urologists, even though over 90% patients can recover 1 year after surgery. Many urologists are trying to modify the surgical technique to resolve this problem. Sustainable functional urethral reconstruction (SFUR) is a novel technique which may improve early urinary continence recovery for both local and locally advanced prostate cancer, and even for those with high volume prostate by providing adequate urethral length with bladder neck tubularization and making sustainable periurethral support with peritoneal flap. The purpose of this study is to verify the impact of this new technique on early recovery of urinary continence, as well as on urinary function and oncological outcomes.
