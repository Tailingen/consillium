Mobicox: Study of Meloxicam to Reduce Prostate Swelling in Permanent Seed Prostate Brachytherapy
Swelling of the prostate can occur during and after a brachytherapy. This swelling can cause urinary problems ranging from difficulty voiding to urinary retention. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether Mobicox started one week before brachytherapy and then continued afterwards is more effective in reducing the risk of needing a catheter than Mobicox given only afterwards.
