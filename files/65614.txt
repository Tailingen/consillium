A Study to Quantify Tumour Perfusion for Spine Metastasis Treated With Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT)
Pre-clinical evidence suggests that radiotherapy reduces tumour-associated vasculature. The investigators will conduct a single-arm prospective study to quantify the reduction in tumour vasculature post-radiotherapy
