Study to Evaluate Safety & Tolerability of BMS-906024 in Combination With Chemotherapy & to Define DLTs & MTD of BMS-906024 in Combination With One of the Following Chemotherapy Regimens; Weekly Paclitaxel, 5FU+Irinotecan or Carboplatin+Paclitaxel in Subjects With Advanced / Metastatic Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to identify a safe and tolerable dose of BMS-906024 in combination with each of the following three chemotherapy regimens: Paclitaxel, 5FU plus Irinotecan (FOLFIRI), or Carboplatin plus Paclitaxel in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors
