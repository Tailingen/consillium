ASCT With Nivolumab in Patients With Multiple Myeloma
This is an open-label, single center trial of Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation (ASCT) with nivolumab in multiple myeloma patients to determine the efficacy and safety of ASCT and PD1 inhibitor combination.

For this purpose, 30 multiple myeloma patients, who have received induction therapy and have achieved a partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) or progression, and thus have unfavorable prognosis, will be treated with nivolumab administered iv at a dose of 100 mg on days 3 before and 17 after high-dose melphalan with autologous stem cell transplantation.

Overall response, Includes complete response, very good partial response, and partial response (based on IMWG criteria), 3 months
Progression free survival (PFS), PFS will be assessed with Kaplan-Meier method from the date of ASCT, with day 0 defined as date of stem cell infusion (in case of tandem transplant the 2nd of 2 transplants will be used) until the date of progression, defined as the date at which the patient starts the next line of therapy or the date of death., 12 months|Overall Survival (OS), Will be assessed with Kaplan-Meier method from the date of ASCT, with day 0 defined as date of stem cell infusion (in case of tandem transplant the 2nd of 2 transplants will be used), 24 months|Frequency of grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events by CTCAE 4.03, Toxicity parameters based on NCI CTCAE 4.03 grades: hematological toxicity (CBC), hepatotoxicity (liver function tests), nephrotoxicity (creatinine), neurotoxicity (attending physician assessment), fatigue (attending physician assessment), rash (attending physician assessment), colitis (attending physician assessment), pneumonitis (attending physician assessment), autoimmune disorders (level of hormones, presence of autoimmune antibodies, attending physician assessment)., 12 months
