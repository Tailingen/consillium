Detection of Functioning Pituitary Microadenoma: PET/MRI Versus PET/CT
This is a prospective case-control study to compare the usefulness of 18F-FDG PET/MRI with that of 18F-FDG PET/CT in detection of functioning pituitary microadenomas.A single dose of 370 Mega-Becquerel (MBq) 18F-FDG will be injected intravenously.Visual and semiquantitative method will be used to assess the PET/MRI and PET/CT images.
Pituitary Adenoma
DRUG: 18F-FDG
Standardized uptake value of 18F-FDG in pituitary adenoma, The semiquantitative analysis will be performed by the same person for all the cases, and the standardized uptake value (SUV) of the tracer in pituitary adenoma will be measured, 5 years
Adverse events collection, Adverse events within 1 week after the injection and scanning of patients and patients will be followed and assessed, 1 week
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be insufficient to locate functioning pituitary microadenoma.This study compared the usefulness of 18F-FDG PET/MRI with that of 18F-FDG PET/CT in detection of functioning pituitary microadenomas in patients with inconclusive conventional MRI findings. Trans-sphenoidal adenomectomy was performed within 2 weeks of imaging.The PET/CT and PET/MRI findings and tracer uptake levels were correlated with the surgical findings and pathological results.
