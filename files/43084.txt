Use of Multi-Parametric MRI With Prostate Biopsy for Cancer Diagnosis.
This is a prospective single center trial to examine the rates of cancer diagnosis when using computerized software to target suspicious lesions within the prostate identified on mpMRI. The primary evaluation involves comparing the rate of cancer diagnosis when using software-based MRI-Ultrasound image fusion guided biopsy to sample mpMRI findings to the use of visual guided biopsy (cognitive or mental targeting) of the same target. The hypothesis being tested is that fusion guided biopsy will increase detection prostate cancer within mpMRI findings as compared to visual guided biopsy of these areas
Prostate Cancer
PROCEDURE: Targeted Biopsy
Evaluation of rates of prostate cancer diagnosis, The primary endpoint of the study is the evaluation of the rates of prostate cancer diagnosis using software based MRI-TRUS imaging fusion targeting of mpMRI lesions as compared to cognitive co-registration and targeting of mpMRI lesions., One week after biopsy
Evaluation of Rate of cancer diagnosis using targeted biopsy, The secondary endpoint of the study is the evaluation of the rate of cancer diagnosis using targeted biopsy (software or cognitive targeting) as compared to standard of care prostate biopsy., One week after biopsy
