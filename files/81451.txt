Atezolizumab in Combination With Bevacizumab, Carboplatin and Pemetrexed for EGFR-mutant Metastatic NSCLC Patients After Failure of EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors
This project will recruit 40 EGFR-mutant metastatic non-small cell lung cancer patients who failed any EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

All recruited patients will receive 1200mg Azetolizumab administered over 60 minutes (1st cycle) and 30 minutes (2nd cycle onwards) intravenously, as well as 7.5mg/kg bevacizumab administered over 90 minutes (1st cycle), 60 minutes (2nd cycle) and 30 minutes (3rd cycle onwards) for every 3 weeks, until radiographically documented disease progression, unacceptable toxicity as judged by investigators or patient withdrawal.

The primary objective is to assess the progression-free survival of this treatment population, and to identify potential genomic and immunologic biomarkers for treatment response. Objective response rate (ORR) will be the primary efficacy endpoint.
NSCLC Stage IIIB|NSCLC Stage IV|EGFR Activating Mutation
DRUG: Atezolizumab|DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Pemetrexed
Objective response rate (ORR), The percentage of patients with radiologically complete or partial response as determined by the investigator according to RECIST version 1.1., 3 years
Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS is measured from the date of study enrollment to radiographically documented progression according to RECIST 1.1 or death from any cause (whichever occurs first).

Participants alive and without disease progression or lost to follow-up will be censored at the date of their last radiographic assessment., 3 years|Time to progression (TTP), TTP is measured from the date of study enrollment to radiographically documented progression according to RECIST 1.1. This does not include death from any cause., 3 years|Duration of response (DoR), 3 years
