A Phase 2 Study in Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Using New Agents With and Without Docetaxel.
To determine the effectiveness of CP-868,596 + docetaxel, AG-013736 + docetaxel and CP-868,596 + AG-013736 + docetaxel in patients previously treated for non-small cell lung cancer.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
DRUG: docetaxel|DRUG: CP-868,596 + docetaxel|DRUG: AG-013736 + docetaxel|DRUG: CP-868,596 + AG-013736 + docetaxel
Determine the anti-tumor efficacy of CP 868,596 plus docetaxel, AG 013736 plus docetaxel, CP 868,596 plus AG 013736 plus docetaxel, and docetaxel alone in patients with advanced NSCLC based on objective tumor response (CR and PR) rate
Determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of daily CP 868,596 and docetaxel on an every 3 week schedule|Determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of daily AG 013736 and docetaxel on an every 3 week schedule|Determine the safety and tolerability of both CP 868,596 and AG 013736 given together with docetaxel on an every 3 week schedule|Assess additional evidence of anti-tumor activity as measured by duration of objective response, progression-free survival, and one-year survival (OS1year)|Evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of AG 013736 and CP 868,596 when given together with and without docetaxel|Evaluate the PK of CP 868,596 when given in combination with docetaxel|Evaluate the PK of docetaxel when given in combination with CP 868,596, or CP 868,596 plus AG 01373
To determine the effectiveness of CP-868,596 + docetaxel, AG-013736 + docetaxel and CP-868,596 + AG-013736 + docetaxel in patients previously treated for non-small cell lung cancer.
