Gadolinium Contrast-enhanced Abbreviated MRI (AMRI) Vs. Standard Ultrasound for Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) Surveillance in Patients with Cirrhosis
This study compares gadolinium contrast-enhanced Abbreviated MRI (AMRI) to standard ultrasound for Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) screening and surveillance in subjects with liver cirrhosis.

Ultrasound (US) is currently used for HCC surveillance. However, US has certain limitations, so physicians use contrast CT or MRI. However, these are expensive and time-consuming procedures. We introduced an abbreviated MRI (AMRI) exam, which works well in cirrhotic and obese patients (unlike US), involves no ionizing radiation (unlike CT), and is rapid (unlike multi-phasic MRI) with total scanner times of less than ten minutes, and can be performed at about the same cost as US. This study in adult patients with cirrhosis will compare the performance of AMRI vs. US for detection of early-stage disease, and will help to define and validate a novel, rapid, accurate, and potentially cost-effective imaging protocol for HCC screening in high-risk individuals.
