Short-course Radiotherapy Combined With CapeOx and PD-1 Inhibitor After Local Excision for High-risk Early Rectal Cancer (TORCH-LE)
This is a single arm phase II study to explore the 3y LRFS and safety for high-risk early rectal cancer after local excision with short-course radiotherapy and chemo-immunotherapy.
Rectal Cancer
RADIATION: Radiation|DRUG: PD-1 antibody|DRUG: Capecitabine|DRUG: Oxaliplatin
3y LRFS, Rate of 3 year local recurrence free survival rate, From date of initiation of treatment until the date of first documented pelvic failure, assessed up to 36 months.
3y DFS, Rate of 3 year disease free survival, From date of initiation of treatment until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 36 months.|3y OS, Rate of 3 year overall survival, From date of initiation of treatment until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 36 months.|Grade 3-4 adverse effects rate, Rate of chemotherapy, radiotherapy and immunotherapy related adverse events, From date of initiation of treatment until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 36 months.
A total of 60 patients with high-risk pathologic stage pT1 or pT2 cancer after local excision but refused radical surgery will be included.

Eligibility criteria include a histological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma located â‰¤7 cm from the anal verge, pT1 after local excision of the primary rectal cancer, with one of the high-risk features including margin positivity/very close margin (\<1mm) at time of local excision, depth of invasion \>1 mm or SM3 invasion (submucosal invasion to the lower third of the submucosal level), high grade or poorly differentiated, lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion, tumour budding, or pT2 tumor.

They will receive 5\*5Gy short-course radiotherapy, followed by 4 cycles of capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (CAPOX) chemotherapy and PD-1 antibody.
