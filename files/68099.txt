Allogeneic Transplantation for Pediatric Leukemias With Unrelated Donors
The study proposes the use of Fludarabine, Busulfan, Anti Thymocyte Globulin Rabbit (ATG) and Total Body Irradiation as a preparative regimen before hematopoietic stem cell transplant from unrelated donor peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC). The hypothesis states that the 100 day mortality after this type of transplant will be significantly below the accepted standards, which is about 30% for unrelated donors.

To evaluate the toxicity (as measures by 100 day survival) after hematopoietic stem cell transplant from an unrelated donor with a novel preparative regimen., 100 day mortality
To evaluate the relapse-free and overall survival after hematopoietic stem cell transplant with Fludarabine/Busulfan/ATG/TBI preparative regimen for pediatric patients with leukemia., 5 years|To evaluate the incidence of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease after hematopoietic stem cell transplant, 5 years
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the toxicity (as measured as 100 day survival) after hematopoietic stem cell transplant from an unrelated donor with a novel preparative regimen of Fludarabine, Busulfan, Anti-Thymocyte Globulin, and Total Body Irradiation for pediatric patients with leukemia. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the relapse-free and overall survival after hematopoietic stem cell transplant as well as to evaluate the incidence of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease after this preparative regimen.
