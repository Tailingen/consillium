Regional Anesthesia for Modified Radical Mastectomy With Axillary Lymph Node Dissection
local and regional anesthesia have been introduced with the goal of reducing the side effects associated with general anesthesia and IV opioid analgesia.our hypothesis is that ultrasound-guided interscalene brachial plexus block and erector spinae plane block will provide efficient surgical anesthesia and postoperative analgesia after modified radical mastectomy.

inadequate analgesia after modified radical mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection may occur with most of regional anesthesia. pain in the axilla and upper limb is related to ineffective block of medial and lateral pectoral nerves as long thoracic and thoracodorsal nerves, leading to inadequate analgesia.The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ultrasound-guided interscalene brachial plexus block and erector spinae plane block for providing surgical anesthesia and postoperative analgesia after modified radical mastectomy.
