Improving Outcomes for Patients Requiring Oral Bowel Preparation for Colonoscopy
Study hypothesis The overall aim of this study is to compare two bowel preparations that are used prior to a colonoscopy procedure.

The principal research questions are:

1. Does the use of a low residue diet increase patient concordance to the bowel preparation instructions?
2. Does the use of a low residue diet decrease the adequacy of assessment of the mucosa?
3. Does the use of a low residue diet increase the willingness of patients to undertake repeated examination as is required for disease follow-up?
4. Does body weight affect perceived tolerability of either group?
