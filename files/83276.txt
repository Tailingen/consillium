GNT Induction Treatment in Locally Advanced NPC
The goal of this clinical trial is to compare overall response rate between gemcitabine, nimotuzumab and toripalimab as induction treatment and gemcitabine combined with cisplatine in paitents with locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma. It aims to answer whether gemcitabine, nimotuzumab and toripalimab as induction treatment show non-inferiority compared to GP induction chemotherapy. Participants will be randomly divided into two induction treatment groups.
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
DRUG: gemcitabine,nimotuzumab, toripalimab|DRUG: gemcitabine, cisplatin
overall response rate, the proportion of patients who achieve complete response and partial response after induction therapy, three weeks after induction therapy
2-year overall survival, 2-year survival rate of patients enrolled in this study, From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months|2-year distant metastasis-free survival, 2-year distant metastasis-free survival rate of patients enrolled in this study, From date of randomization until the date of distant metastasis or last follow-up time,, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months|2-year local regional recurrence-free survival, 2-year local regional recurrence-free survival rate of patients enrolled in this study, From date of randomization until the date of local and/or lymph node recurrence or last follow-up time,, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months
adverse events, treatment-related adverse events during treatment and follow-up time, through study completion, an average of 1 year
