Prostate Cancer Imaging With Radioactive Tracer and Ultrasound Detector Compared to MRI and ProstaScint
This is a small study to determine if probe, similar to an ultrasound probe, can detect prostate cancer more specifically than other imaging studies in patients with a positive prostate cancer biopsy.
Prostate Cancer
DEVICE: Proxiscan device
Detection of PSMA antibody (ProstaScint)uptake patterns measured by Proxiscan in comparison with anatomic biopsy reports, conventional SPECT and MRI scans within one month of Proxiscan, Detection of PSMA antibody (ProstaScint) uptake patterns measured by the new transrectal compact gamma camera (Proxiscan) will be compared to the anatomic biopsy reports along with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and conventional ProstaScint (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) SPECT imaging results. All imaging and biopsy results performed within one month will be used for this investigation, Within on month of scan and corresponding MRI
