Lenvatinib and Adebrelimab Combined With GEMOX in the Perioperative Treatment of Potentially Resectable Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma
A single-arm, prospective clinical study was conducted to enroll 20 subjects. Each subject was treated with oral Lenvatinib + Adebrelimab + GEMOX (gemcitabine + oxaliplatin). The treatment phase before surgery was 3 cycles, and the evaluation was performed every 2 cycles. The evaluation was repeated before surgery, and the decision of surgery was made according to the evaluation results.

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Lenvatinib and Adebrelimab combined with GEMOX in the perioperative treatment of potentially resectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.
