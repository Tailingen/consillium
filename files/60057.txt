Folfirinox + Cetuximab Chemotherapy, in First Line, With Wild RAS and According to BRAF Status in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
This retrospective study, will evaluate patient outcomes after triplet chemotherapy (FOLFIRINOX) (5 Fluorouracil + oxaliplatin + irinotecan) plus cetuximab 1st line treatment focusing on efficacy and safety in a RAS (KRAS, NRAS (neuroblastoma rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer population, and according to BRAF (murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B) status and primary tumor location.

In Europe, there are 447,000 new cases of colorectal cancer each year. Approximately 25% of patients present with metastases at initial diagnosis and almost 50% of patients with mCRC (metastatic colorectal cancer) will develop metastases

. Chemotherapy represents the backbone of treatment, and survival is linked with the administration of all three active cytotoxic agents (5-fluorouracil/folinate, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan) in the first line treatment of metastatic colorectal disease.

Monoclonal antibodies such as cetuximab in combination with chemotherapy are a first line treatment option in metastatic RAS (rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) wild type metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).

Phase II trials evaluating triplet chemotherapy plus cetuximab reported interesting results in terms of efficacy (response rate, resectability...), but at the price of an increased rate of toxic effects.

This retrospective study, will evaluate patient outcomes after triplet chemotherapy (FOLFIRINOX) (5 Fluorouracil + oxaliplatin + irinotecan) plus cetuximab 1st line treatment focusing on efficacy and safety in a RAS (KRAS, NRAS (neuroblastoma rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) wild-type mCRC (metastatic colorectal cancer) population, and according to BRAF (murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B) status and primary tumor location.
