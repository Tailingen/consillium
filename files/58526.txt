ANRS CO24 OncoVIHAC (Onco VIH Anti Checkpoint)
A Multicenter, Observational, National Cohort for HIV Infected Patients with a Cancer treated by Immune-Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICPi) for less than one month or to be treated with an ICPi such as anti-PD-1 or anti-PDL-1 or anti-CTLA4, monitored in some French hospitals .

The objective of the study is to assess the safety of these new agents in HIV-infected patients.

As an observatory, the number of participants planned is not predetermined: the aim is to include for 2 years any participant infected with HIV and having a cancer treated by ICPi in one of the centers that have agreed to participate.

50 participants will be recruited for Substudy "OncoVIRIM" during the study period (regardless of tumor type or ICPi type); 8 or 9 time points (blood samples) will be scheduled

The cohort " ANRS CO24 OncoVIHAC " is declared to authorities like category 2 research .

No intervention in the observatory, a collection of data will be carried out in M0, M6, M12, M18 and M24.

For the physiopathological Substudy OncoVIRIM : Blood samples will be collected to constitute cell bank, plasma bank, serum bank, DNA bank in order to meet the objectives of this substudy and possibly for complementary research

* HIV-RNA plasma viral load
* Evolution of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells counts, CD4/CD8 ratio
* To assess the efficacy endpoint : progression-free survival, overall survival rate at 1 year and 2 years.

* Other immunological and virological explorations on HIV :
* To evaluate low level HIV replication and size of the HIV reservoir
* To evaluate effects of ICPi on HIV-specific immune responses
* To show the effects of ICPi on HIV-related immune alterations such as T cell differentiation, T cell activation/exhaustion and systemic inflammation
* To demonstrate an effect on other viruses-specific T cells and viremia (EBV, CMV, HHV-8, HBV et HCV (if co-infected)
* To better understand the pathophysiology of ICPi-related immune adverse effects, particularly the development of infraclinical auto-immunity : monitoring of autoantibodies and analysis of changes in B cell antibodies repertoires
* To find immune biomarkers predictive for clinical response to ICPi, MHC class I and II in particular and description of any gene of interest in the context of ICPi treatment
