SIRT or TACE Plus Lenvatinib and PD-(L)1 Inhibitor in High Burden HCC
This multicenter retrospective study evaluated the efficacy and safety of selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) combined with lenvatinib and PD-(L)1 inhibitors (SIRT-L-P) versus transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with lenvatinib and PD-(L)1 inhibitors (TACE-L-P) in patients with HCC beyond up-to-seven criteria or with portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT). Tumor response, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and adverse events (AEs) were compared between the two groups.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma Non-resectable
COMBINATION_PRODUCT: SIRT-L-P|COMBINATION_PRODUCT: TACE-L-P
Progression-free survival, The time from the first SIRT or TACE procedure until the date that progressive disease according to mRECIST or death was confirmed., 32 months
Objective response rate (ORR), the percentage of patients with complete or partial response according to mRECIST and RECIST 1.1, 32 months|Overall survival, the time from the first SIRT or TACE until the date of all-cause mortality, 32 months|Disease control rate (DCR), the percentage of patients with complete, partial response, or stable disease according to mRECIST and RECIST 1.1, 32 months
Consecutive patients with HCC beyond up-to-seven criteria or with PVTT treated with SIRT-L-P or TACE-L-P from June 2022 to October 2024 were screened. Tumor response was evaluated according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST) and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1). Clinical outcomes, including tumor response, PFS, OS, and AEs were compared between the two groups.
