Airway Segmented Stent Modified With 3D Printing for Malignant Stricture Involving Carina and Distal Bronchi
In this study, we used the covered metallic segmented airway stent to treat malignant strictures involving carina and bronchi distal to carina and aimed to determine the feasibility, efficacy and safety of this technique.
Stricture; Trachea|Malignant Neoplasm
PROCEDURE: Airway stent implantation
Improvement in Dyspnea using Hugh-Jones classication as criteria, Hugh-Jones classication: dyspnea scale that includes 5 categories., 3 days|Stent patency time, Stent patency time is defined as the time from the stent implantation to stent restenosis or death due to any cause, or censored at date last known alive., 2 months|Overall survival, OS is defined as the time from the stent implantation to death due to any cause, or censored at date last known alive., 6 months
Number of participants with adverse events that are related to stent implantation, Adverse events as follows: migration of the stent, severe chest pain, hemoptysis, granuloma formation, pneumonia and accumulation of secretion, 2 months
