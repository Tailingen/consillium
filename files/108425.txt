Novel Peptide Vaccination for Patients With Advanced Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and clinical efficacy of novel peptide vaccination for advanced prostate cancer

Cell division cycle associated gene 1(CDCA1) has been identified using genome-wide expression profile analysis by the use of cDNA microarray in our previous studies. We have determined the HLA-A\*2402 restricted epitope peptides derived from CDCA1, CDCA1-A24-56. This epitope showed strong IFN-g production when stimulated with the appropriate targets expressed the appropriate protein and HLA-A\*2402. Furthermore, when vaccinated this peptide, specific CTL was determined after the vaccination. Therefore we focused on the safety and efficacy of novel vaccination for the advanced prostate cancer patients who already showed resistance to standard hormonal therapy and chemotherapy.
