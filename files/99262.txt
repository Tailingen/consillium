GEfitinib Plus viNOrelbine in Advanced EGFR Mutated NSCLC. GENOA Trial
A sub-population of patients affected by non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with activating mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) do not gain benefit from treatment with tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs). The hypothesis of this study is that the addition of chemotherapy with oral vinorelbine to first-line TKI might result in improved outcomes in EGFR-mutated patients.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: oral vinorelbine|DRUG: Gefitinib
Progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 6 months, Progression-free survival is defined as the time from randomization until disease progression or death due to any cause., 6 months; tumor assessment is performed every 6 weeks from randomization until progressive disease
Overall survival (OS) rate at 1 year (1Y-OS), 2 years (2Y-OS), and 3 years (3Y-OS), Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization to the date of patient date due to any cause or discontinuation of the study. Each OS rate is calculated at the respective end-point (1 year for 1Y-OS, 2 years for 2Y-OS, and 3 years for 3Y-OS)., Overall survival assessment is performed at every visit from randomization of each patient until his/her death|Response rate (RR), Assessment is performed by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, tumor assessment is performed every 6 weeks from the start of study treatment until progressive disease|Safety profile: Safety will be assessed by medical interview, physical examination, and blood collection for complete blood count on days 1 and 8 and biochemistry, Evaluation of the safety profile of gefitinib plus oral vinorelbine as compared to the safety profile of gefitinib alone. Safety will be assessed by medical interview, physical examination, and blood collection for complete blood count on days 1 and 8 and biochemistry (sodium, chloride, potassium, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, glucose, ammonia, creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, Î³-glutamyl transpeptidase, lactate dehydrogenase, total and fractioned bilirubin, total proteins, albumin) on day 1., assessment of safety profile is performed at every visit (on day 1 and day 8 of each 21-days cycle) from the start of study treatment until three weeks after its interruption due to intolerance or progressive disease
In spite of the dramatic improvements obtained with EGFR-TKIs in patients affected by NSCLC with activating mutations of EGFR, a fraction of these patients (about 30%) do not respond to EGFR-TKIs or achieve a response of short duration. It has been suggested that these patients may be affected by additional mutations that confer resistance to EGFR-TKIs in spite of the presence of activating mutations of the EGFR gene. Pre-clinical studies show that the addition of chemotherapy to gefitinib may result in increased anti-proliferative activity, and subsequent clinical studies suggest that the synergic activity of gefitinib and chemotherapy can depend from the employed schedules (concurrent versus sequential). Additionally, data from phase I trials of gefitinib plus vinorelbine revealed a high incidence of severe hematological toxicity with concurrent administration, while sequential schedules resulted in a more manageable safety profile.

On the basis of the aforementioned data, we hypothesize that the sequential combination of vinorelbine and gefitinib might result in improved outcomes (in terms of response and survival) in EGFR-mutated NSCLC over gefitinib alone with acceptable tolerability. The availability of an oral formulation of vinorelbine makes it possible to offer the patients an exclusively oral treatment.
