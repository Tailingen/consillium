Irreversible Electroporation(IRE) For Unresectable Prostatic Neoplasms
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of irreversible electroporation (IRE) for unresectable Prostatic Neoplasms.
Prostatic Neoplasms
PROCEDURE: Irreversible electroporation (IRE)|DEVICE: NanoKnife
Number of participants with Adverse events, 6 month
Percentage of lesions that show no sign of recurrence 12 months after IRE, 12 months|Voltage (A minimum and maximum range of voltage for safe and effective IRE), A minimum and maximum range of voltage for safe and effective IRE will be analyzed for optimal choice., 3 months|Progress free disease (PFS), 12 months|Overall survival (OS), Patients will be followed for 36 months after IRE for OS analyzed., 36 months
By enrolling patients with unresectable Prostatic Neoplasms adapted to enrolled criteria, this study will document for the first time the safety and the short and long term efficacy of percutaneous IRE for unresectable Prostatic Neoplasms.
