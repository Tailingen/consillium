A Study of NOX66 Plus Doxorubicin in Anthracycline-na√Øve, Adult Patients With Soft Tissue Sarcoma
This is a Phase I, open-label, dose-escalation and dose-expansion study of NOX66 given rectally, in cohorts of patients with metastatic soft tissue sarcoma (STS) who have not been exposed to anthracycline therapy, using a fixed dose-escalation schema every 21 days to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of NOX66 and doxorubicin.
Metastatic Soft-tissue Sarcoma
DRUG: NOX66|DRUG: NOX66|DRUG: NOX66|DRUG: NOX66|DRUG: Doxorubicin
Dose Escalation: Number of Patients With Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs), Determination of the MTD of NOX66 in combination with doxorubicin. MTD is defined as the dose level at which no more than 1 patient out of 6 experiences a DLT at the end of Cycle 1., Cycle 1 of each dose (Cycle length is 21 days)|Number of Patients With Adverse Events (AEs) for NOX66, Characterization of the safety and tolerability of NOX66., From first study treatment with DOX66 monotherapy through study completion, approximately of 14 months and 20 days. From February 11, 2022, to May 1, 2023
The study will contain dose-escalation cohorts and dose-expansion cohorts. The study design allows an exploration of different doses of NOX66 with safety monitoring to ensure the safety of the patients.

Dose-escalation cohorts: It will include three planned Treatment Groups (800, 1200, 1800 mg daily) and patients enrolled in these groups will receive 7 days of monotherapy treatment with NOX66 followed by a 5-day washout period. Thereafter, patients will enter a combination therapy (only if no significant toxicity is observed during monotherapy). This will commence with Cycle 1, which will consist of 7 days of NOX66, and on Day 2 of the 21-day cycle, doxorubicin will be administered. Patients will continue to be treated for up to 6 x 21-day cycles of NOX66 and doxorubicin. New patients will be entered at the next dose level of NOX66, if no dose-limiting toxicities have occurred among the first 3 patients at the end of cycle 1. During the dose-escalation, MTD of the combination of NOX66 and doxorubicin will be determined.

Dose-expansion cohort: On completion of the dose-escalation cohort, patients will be enrolled into a dose-expansion at the MTD of the combination of NOX66 and doxorubicin. All patients will enter directly into 21-day combination cycles and will be given NOX66 therapy for 7 days and doxorubicin will be administered on Day 2 of each cycle. Treatment will be terminated upon disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or a maximum of 6 cycles.
