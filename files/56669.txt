Pazopanib/DCE-MRIs in Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)
All patients who participate in this study will receive pazopanib. Pazopanib is an oral drug (pill) that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of advanced kidney cancer. In this study, the investigators plan to learn more about the way this drug works by using special scans (MRIs and Ultrasounds) to help evaluate how this drug is working on this disease. Approximately 20 people with advanced kidney cancer will be enrolled on this study.
Carcinoma, Renal Cell
DRUG: Pazopanib|DEVICE: DCE-MRI and Quantitative Doppler Ultrasound
Evaluate Early Changes in DCE-MRI, To evaluate early changes in DCE-MRI measures of tumor vascular permeability after treatment with pazopanib., 12 weeks
Correlating Baseline DCE-MRI and early changes in DCE-MRI with other measures of treatment effectiveness, Correlating baseline DCE-MRI and early changes in DCE-MRI with other measures of treatment effectiveness, including clinical outcomes and histologic measures of tumor angiogenesis.
Overall objectives PRIMARY: - Assessment of early changes in DCE-MRI and ultrasound measures of tumor perfusion in the setting of pazopanib therapy for patients with metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma SECONDARY: - Correlation of baseline DCE-MRI and ultrasound parameters and clinical outcome - Correlation of early (48 +/- 24 hr after treatment) changes in DCE-MRI and ultrasound parameters and clinical outcome - Correlation of baseline (and changes) in DCE-MRI and ultrasound parameters with VHL status in tumors and histocytometric analysis of endothelial cell activation in archival nephrectomy specimens - Provide an insight in the respective predictive values of DCE-MRI and US for pazopanib treatment
