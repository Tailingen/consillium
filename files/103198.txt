A Phase 1a/b Dose Escalation Study of the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of OMP-131R10
This is an open-label Phase 1a/b dose-escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability, and PK of OMP-131R10 as a single agent for advanced solid tumors and in subjects with metastatic colorectal cancer.
Advanced Relapsed Tumors|Refractory Solid Tumors
DRUG: OMP-131R10|DRUG: FOLFIRI
Incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), Subject will be assessed for DLTs during the evaluation window (28 days). Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) has been determined., DLTs during the evaluation (28 days)
The Phase 1a portion of the study in subjects with advanced solid tumors will consist of a dose escalation part followed by a dose-expansion cohort. OMP-131R10 will be administered IV on the first day of each 14-day cycle.

Dose escalation will follow a traditional 3+3 framework. Treatment will be continued until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity.

The Phase 1b portion of the study will be conducted in subjects with metastatic colorectal cancer whose tumors have progressed after at least 1 line of therapy for metastatic disease.

Treatment will consist of OMP-131R10 and the FOLFIRI chemotherapy regimen.
