A Pilot Presurgical Trial of REGN5678 (Anti-PSMA x CD28) in Patients With High-risk, Localized Prostate Cancer Followed by Radical Prostatectomy
To learn about the safety and effects of a drug called REGN5678 when it is given to patients with high-risk prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer|Radical Prostatectomy
DRUG: REGN5678|DRUG: Piflufolastat F18
Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, Through study completion; an average of 1 year
Primary Objectives:

• To evaluate safety and tolerability of REGN5678 (antiPSMAxCD28) in patients with high-risk, localized prostate cancer.

Secondary Objectives:

• To assess the proportion of patients who achieve pathological response with REGN5678 in men with high-risk, localized prostate cancer.

Exploratory Objectives:

* To evaluate immune responses in the prostate tumor microenvironment and peripheral blood after treatment with REGN5678 as compared to pre-treatment samples and untreated control samples.
* To evaluate efficacy of REGN5678 in men with high-risk, localized prostate cancer. To evaluate exploratory imaging biomarkers for REGN5678 by PSMA PET/CT and FDG PET/CT
