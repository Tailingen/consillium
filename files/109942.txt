Ribociclib and Endocrine Therapy or Chemotherapy With or Without Bevacizumab for Metastatic Breast Cancer in First Line
This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of first-line treatment ribociclib in combination with aromatase inhibitor (AI) or fulvestrant OR capecitabine with bevacizumab OR paclitaxel with / without bevacizumab in patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer with visceral metastasis.

Half of the patients will receive a combination of ribociclib and AI/fulvestrant while the other half will receive capecitabine + bevacizumab or paclitaxel +/- bevacizumab.

Efficacy in terms of PFS, PFS is defined as time from randomization to progression of disease or death of any cause, whichever comes first. It will be assessed by imaging until progressive disease or start of next-line therapy., Up to approximately 15 months.
Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as time from randomization to death of any cause., Up to approximately 48 months.|Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with best overall response of complete or partial response according to RECIST 1.1., Up to approximately 15 months.|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), CBR is defined as the proportion of patients with best overall response of complete or partial response or stable disease lasting 24 weeks or more according to RECIST 1.1., Up to approximately 15 months|Time To Response (TTR), TTR is defined as time from randomization to first occurrence of any response (complete or partial) according to RECIST 1.1., Up to approximately 15 months.|Number of participants with Adverse Events, Type, frequency and severity (according to CTCAE v4.03) of adverse events, Until 30 days after end of treatment, up to approximately 16 months.|Time to deterioration of ECOG performance status, Time to deterioration of ECOG performance status by at least one point from baseline., Until 30 days after end of treatment, up to approximately 16 months|Tolerability of treatment, By-patient listings of safety laboratory (hemoglobin, platelets, white blood cells with differentials, international normalized ratio , serum creatinine, bilirubin, Alanine-Aminotransferase (ALT) and Aspartate-Aminotransferase (AST))., Until 30 days after end of treatment, up to approximately 16 months.|corrected QT interval (QTc) time, By-patient listings of cardiac monitoring., Until 30 days after end of treatment, up to approximately 16 months.|Health-related quality of life (QoL), Health-related QoL will be assessed with the EORTC Quality of life questionnaire (QLQ) QLQ-C30., Up to 36 months.|Side effects of treatment, One question on treatment burden, Up to 36 months.|Time spent on treatment, Burden by treatment will be assessed with 4 questions on time spent on treatment, Up to 36 months
Symptomatic PFS (sPFS), sPFS is defined as time from randomization until symptomatic deterioration (new or worsening of persisting symptoms) or death as per local investigator., Up to approximately 15 months.
This is a prospective, randomized, open-label, two-arm, multicenter, interventional phase III trial in Germany. The study will include adult women with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer with visceral metastases, who received no prior therapy for advanced disease.

158 patients will be enrolled and randomized 1:1 (stratified by the presence of lung and / or liver metastases) to receive Arm A: a combination of ribociclib and AI or fulvestrant; OR Arm B: capecitabine + bevacizumab OR paclitaxel +/- bevacizumab

Treatment will be continued until disease progression, intolerable toxicity or death. Progression-free survival (PFS) will be based on tumor assessments by local radiologists/investigator using RECIST v1.1 criteria. Treatment might be continued beyond RECIST-defined progressive disease (PD) in case of negligible or clinically irrelevant disease progression according to the investigator's discretion until clinically relevant disease progression or symptomatic deterioration.
