Artificial Intelligent Accelerates the Learning Curve for Mastering Contrast-enhanced Ultrasound of Thyroid Nodules
The goal of this observational study is to learn about the learning curve for mastering the thyroid imaging reporting and data system of contrast-enhanced ultrasound with the assistance of artificial intelligence in patients with thyroid nodules. The main questions it aims to answer are:

1. Can we develop a artificial intelligent software to assist doctors in the diagnosis of thyroid nodules using contrast-enhanced ultrasound?
2. Can artificial intelligent reduce the number of cases and time for doctors to master the contrast-enhanced ultrasound diagnosis of thyroid nodules?

Participants will be asked to undergo contrast-enhanced ultrasound examination and ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration of thyroid nodules. Researchers will compare the number of cases and time for doctors with and without artificial intelligent assistance to master the contrast-enhanced ultrasound diagnosis of thyroid nodules to see if artificial intelligent reduce the number of cases and time.
