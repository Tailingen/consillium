Contrast-enhanced vs. B-mode Ultrasound-guided Percutaneous Biopsy of Retroperitoneal Tumors
Background: Retroperitoneal tumors are typically large and inhomogeneous, with a variable amount of necrosis within the tumor mass which decreases the diagnostic yield of biopsy (false negative or inadequate).

Rationale: Real-time contrast enhancement can highlight the viable tumoral tissue and avoid the necrotic area.

Aims: To compare contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) guidance and conventional (B-mode) ultrasound (US) guidance in terms of diagnostic yield, need for repeat biopsy, and rate of adverse events.

Methods: A consecutive series of patients with previously documented retroperitoneal tumors and indications for percutaneous biopsy were randomly assigned to benefit from the standard of practice B-mode US-guided biopsy or CEUS-guided biopsy.

The diagnostic accuracy, need for repeat biopsy, and adverse events were noted.
