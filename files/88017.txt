Protein Needs Study
Severe muscle loss in patients with cancer has been associated with increased physical disability, extended hospitalization, infectious and noninfectious complications, increased risk of severe toxicity during cancer treatment, poor quality of life and shortened survival. Adequate protein is key to sustain muscle mass and overall health. However, current nutritional recommendations are not specific or evidence-based. The aim of this project is to determine the protein needs of patients with colorectal or breast cancer. Protein needs will be determined using a novel, non-invasive approach. Our results will inform nutritional recommendations and guidelines with the ultimate goal of improving outcomes for people with cancer.
