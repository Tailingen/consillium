Leukemia
DRUG: Dasatinib
Number of Participants Who Died, Experienced Other Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Adverse Events (AEs) and AEs Leading to Study Drug Discontinuation., AEs: any new untoward medical occurrences/worsening of pre-existing medical condition, whether or not related to study drug. SAE: any AE that resulted in death; was life threatening; resulted in persistent/significant disability/incapacity; resulted in/prolonged an existing in-patient hospitalization; was a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or was an overdose. Participants who discontinued the study due to AEs were recorded. These data differ from that in the Participant Flow section. This is because the data were collected on 2 different pages of the Case Report Form and were not reconciled., From start of study until up to 30 days after end of study participation. Median duration of exposure (on-study time) was 23.4 months.|Number of Participants Who Experienced Drug-related AEs and Drug-related SAEs., Drug-related AEs are those events with a relationship to the study therapy of certain; probable; or possible or missing. Drug-related SAEs are those events with any relationship to the study therapy., From start of study until up to 30 days after end of study participation. Median duration of exposure (on-study time) was 23.4 months.|Number of Participants With Grade 3-4 Hematology Abnormalities, Abnormalities were graded per the National Cancer Institute(NCI)Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC), v3.0(Grade 1 = mild, Grade 2 = moderate, Grade 3 = severe, Grade 4 = life threatening). Grade 3 and 4 criteria are as follows: Hemoglobin: Grade 3:6.5 - \<8.0g/dL, Grade 4: \<6.5g/dL. Platelets: Grade 3: 25.0 - \<50.0\*10\^9/L, Grade 4: \<25.0\*10. Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC): Grade 3: 0.5 - \<1.0\*10\^9/L, Grade 4: \<0.5\*10\^9/L.White Blood Cells (WBC) : Grade 3: 1.0 - \<2.0\*10\^9/L, Grade 4: \<1.0\*10\^9/L., From start of study until up to 30 days after end of study participation. Median duration of exposure (on-study time) was 23.4 months.|Number of Participants With Grade 3-4 Serum Chemistry Abnormalities, Abnormalities were graded per the NCI (CTC), v3.0 (Grade 1 = mild, Grade 2 = moderate, Grade 3 = severe, Grade 4 = life threatening). Grade 3 and 4 criteria are as follows: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT): Grade 3: 5.0-20.0 \* ULN (upper limit of normal), Grade 4: \>20.0 \* ULN; Calcium: Grade 3: 6.0-\<7.0 or \>12.5-13.5 mg/dL, Grade 4: \<0.6-\>13.5 mg/dL; Bilirubin: Grade 3: \>3-10 \* ULN, Grade 4: \>10 \* ULN; Creatinine: Grade 3: \>3.0-6.0 \* ULN, Grade 4: \>6.0 \* ULN; Albumin: Grade 3: \<2g/dL (Grade 4 not defined in NCI CTC); Magnesium: Grade 3: 0.6-\<0.8 or \>2.46-6.6mEq/L, Grade 4: \<0.6 or \>6.6mEq/L., From start of study until up to 30 days after end of study participation. Median duration of exposure (on-study time) was 23.4 months.|Number of Participants With Dose Interruptions and Dose Reductions, Dose interruptions and reductions were allowed, in order to optimize individual participant's hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular response while maintaining and evaluating safety and tolerability of long-term exposure to dasatinib. A dose reduction is defined as the administration of a dose at a lower level compared to previous dose and such that reduced dose, or a lower dose, is given at least 4 consecutive times. In determining the reductions, dose level would be compared to the previous non-null dose. Dose interruption is defined as a complete omission of dosing for 4 consecutive times., From start of study to final assessment (up to 32.2 months).
Number of Participants With Complete Hematologic Response (CHR), CHR should meet all of the following criteria: WBC \<= Institutional ULN; ANC \>= 1000/mm\^3 ; Platelets \< 450 000/mm\^3 , no blasts or promyelocytes in peripheral blood; \< 5% myelocytes plus metamyelocytes in peripheral blood; basophils in peripheral blood \< 20% and no extramedullary involvement (including no hepatomegaly or splenomegaly). CHR can begin only 14 days after the start of treatment., Pre-treatment to study discontinuation. Median duration of exposure (on-study time) was 23.4 months.|Median Number of Months of CHR (Kaplan Meier Method), CHR: WBC\<=ULN (range: 9.29-12.5\*10\^3 c\\uL); ANC \>=1000/mm\^3;Platelets \<450000/mm\^3,no blasts/promyelocytes in peripheral blood; \<5% myelocytes+metamyelocytes in peripheral blood; basophils in peripheral blood \<20% \& no extramedullary involvement. Duration computed for chronic phase participants, measured in months from first day CHR criteria met, provided they are confirmed 4 weeks later, until progression of disease, treatment discontinuation due to progressive disease or death. Participants who neither discontinue due to progression, nor progress nor die censored on date of last assessment., Pre-treatment to study discontinuation. Median duration of exposure (on-study time) was 23.4 months.|Number of Participants With Major Cytogenetic Response (MCyR), Cytogenetic responses are based on the prevalence of Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) metaphases among cells in metaphase on a bone marrow sample. MCyR is defined as number of participants with Complete Cytogenetic Response (CCyR): 0% Ph+ cells in metaphase in bone marrow or Partial Cytogenetic Response (PCyR): \>0% to 35% Ph+ cells in metaphase in bone marrow., Pre-treatment to study discontinuation. Median duration of exposure (on-study time) was 23.4 months.|Median Number of Months of Major Cytogenetic Response (MCyR), MCyR: 0% Ph+ cells in metaphase in bone marrow or Partial Cytogenetic Response (PCyR): \>0% to 35% Ph+ cells in metaphase in bone marrow.The duration of MCyR was computed for chronic phase participants whose best response is either CCyR or PCyR. It was measured in months from the time measurement criteria are first met for CCyR or PCyR (whichever status is recorded first) until the date of progression or death. Participants who neither progress nor die are censored on the date of their last cytogenetic assessment., Pre-treatment to study discontinuation. Median duration of exposure (on-study time) was 23.4 months.|Number of Participants With Best Cytogenetic Response, Cytogenetic responses are based on the prevalence of Ph+ metaphases among cells in metaphase on a bone marrow sample. CCyR: 0% Ph+ cells in metaphase in bone marrow, PCyR: \>0% to 35% Ph+ cells in metaphase in bone marrow, Minor CyR: \>35% to 65% Ph+ cells in metaphase in bone marrow, Minimal CyR: \>65% to 95% Ph+ cells in metaphase in bone marrow and No CyR: \>95% to 100% Ph+ cells in metaphase in bone marrow., Pre-treatment to study discontinuation. Median duration of exposure (on-study time) was 23.4 months.|Median Number of Months of Progression-free Survival (PFS) (Kaplan Meier Method), Interval between randomization date \& earliest date of disease progression/death due to any cause, assessed by the Independent Radiology Review Committee (IRRC) using modified World Health Organization (WHO) criteria to define progressive disease (PD): \>=25% increase in sum of products of diameters (SOPD) of lesions compared with smallest SOPD recorded for study period or progression of any non-index lesion/appearance of new lesion. If no progression/death, date of last tumor assessment used. For participants who had no on-study tumor assessments \& were still alive, date of randomization used., Baseline to study discontinuation. Median duration of exposure (on-study time) was 23.4 months.|Median Number of Months of Overall Survival (OS) (Kaplan Meier Method), Overall survival was defined as the median number of months from baseline to death from any cause., Baseline to study discontinuation. Median duration of exposure (on-study time) was 23.4 months.
