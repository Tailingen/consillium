Study of a c-Met Inhibitor PLB1001 in Patients With PTPRZ1-MET Fusion Gene Positive Recurrent High-grade Gliomas
This phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study was conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended phase II dose (RP2D), dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), pharmacokinetics (PK) profile, and preliminary antitumor activity of single and multiple doses of PLB1001 in Patients with PTPRZ1-MET fusion gene positive recurrent high-grade Gliomas.
Glioma
DRUG: PLB1001
Percentage of participants with dose-limiting toxicities, The primary endpoint is evaluation of safety and tolerability during all the study of therapy following the initiation of single and multiple doses of PLB1001. The safety and tolerability variables to be evaluated in this study are adverse events, vital signs, and electrocardiograms (ECGs), Incidence and nature of DLTs (Dose-Limiting Toxicities), to determine the MTD (Maximum Tolerated Dose)., 2 years
Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) of PLB1001 and its metabolite, In the study of single-dose, full Pharmacokinetics(PK) profiles of PLB1001 will be obtained following administration of a single oral dose of PLB1001 on Day 1 to Day 2. At multiple-dose, Pharmacokinetics(PK) sampling will include a pre-dose and at the 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16 hour time points on days 1and 15 of dosing in the first 28-Day cycle of therapy, and pre-dose on days 2, 16 and 17 of the first 28-Day cycle of therapy, Day 1-3 Single Dose and Day 1-28 Steady State|Maximum plasma concentration observed (Cmax) of PLB1001 and its metabolite, In the study of single-dose, full Pharmacokinetics(PK) profiles of PLB1001 will be obtained following administration of a single oral dose of PLB1001 on Day 1 to Day 2. At multiple-dose, Pharmacokinetics(PK) sampling will include a pre-dose and at the 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16 hour time points on days 1and 15 of dosing in the first 28-Day cycle of therapy, and pre-dose on days 2, 16 and 17 of the first 28-Day cycle of therapy, Day 1-3 Single Dose and Day 1-28 Steady State|Time to Cmax (Tmax) of PLB1001 and its metabolite, In the study of single-dose, full Pharmacokinetics(PK) profiles of PLB1001 will be obtained following administration of a single oral dose of PLB1001 on Day 1 to Day 2. At multiple-dose, Pharmacokinetics(PK) sampling will include a pre-dose and at the 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16 hour time points on days 1and 15 of dosing in the first 28-Day cycle of therapy, and pre-dose on days 2, 16 and 17 of the first 28-Day cycle of therapy, Day 1-3 Single Dose and Day 1-28 Steady State|Preliminary antitumor activity of PLB1001, Preliminary antitumor activity of PLB1001 assessed using RANO, 2 years
This is a Phase I, open-label study of PLB1001 administered orally to patients with PTPRZ1-MET fusion gene positive recurrent high-grade Gliomas. The aim of dose-escalation study is to estimate the MTD and to identify the dose-limiting toxicity(DLT) and the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for PLB1001 single agent as well as to determine the PK/PD profile. Aprox. 20 patients will be enrolled in this study.

PLB1001 is a potent selective c-Met inhibitor. PLB1001 acts on cancer by blocking abnormal cMET-mediated signaling (including PTPRZ1-MET fusion gene), leading to profound tumor growth inhibition in xenografts of PTPRZ1-MET fusion gene positive glioblastoma tumor.
