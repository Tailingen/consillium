Liposomal Irinotecan Plus 5-FU / LV Combined With Paricalcitol in Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Cancer Progressed on Gemcitabine-based Therapy
Given the efficacy of nanoliposomal irinotecan as a second-line regimen in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), together with the favorable toxicity profile of paricalcitol and its interplay with irinotecan metabolism, the investigators propose a second-line pilot study in advanced PDAC that will enroll patients who have progressed on a gemcitabine-based regimen.

DRUG: 5-FU|DRUG: Leucovorin|DRUG: Liposomal Irinotecan|DRUG: Paricalcitol|PROCEDURE: Serum and plasma blood samples|PROCEDURE: Tumor biopsy
Tolerability between two different dose levels of paricalcitol added to the combo regimen of liposomal irinotecan plus 5-FU / LV as measured by the occurrence of grade 3 and 4 toxicities, -Toxicity will be graded using CTCAE version 5.0, Through 30 days after completion of paricalcitol treatment (estimated to be 28 weeks)
Overall response rate (ORR), * The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).
* Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm and disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level.
* Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., Through completion of treatment (estimated to be 20 weeks)|Progression-free survival (PFS), * PFS: PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first.
* Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions)., Through completion of follow-up (estimated to be 72 weeks)|Overall survival (OS), -Overall survival (OS) is defined as the date from treatment to death or last follow-up., Through completion of follow-up (estimated to be 72 weeks)|CA19-9 biochemical response rate, -The biochemical response (BR) is defined as more than 50% of decrease from baseline CA 19-9., Through beginning of cycle 10 (estimated to be 18 weeks)|Duration of overall response, - The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started)., Through completion of treatment (estimated to be 20 weeks)|Duration of complete response, * The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.
* Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm and disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level., Through completion of treatment (estimated to be 20 weeks)|Duration of stable disease, * Duration of stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.
* Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study., Through completion of treatment (estimated to be 20 weeks)
