SDX-105 in Combination With Rituxan for Patients With Relapsed Indolent or Mantle Cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL)
SUMMARY:

This is an open label study combining Rituxan and SDX-105. Rituxan will be given on day 1 followed by a 30-60 minute intravenous infusion of SDX-105 on day 2 and day 3. Treatment will repeat every 21 days (a cycle). Treatment can continue for up to 6 cycles (about 4 months) if tumor status improves and there are no unacceptable side effects. Patients will be followed for up to 2 years or until disease progression.

RATIONALE:

Rituxan has been shown to increase the sensitivity of cells to chemotherapy. The combination of SDX-105 and Rituxan has been effective in both the laboratory and in a recent clinical study with Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients.

PURPOSE:

This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of SDX-105 plus Rituxan in patients with Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who have relapsed after taking Rituxan.
Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
DRUG: bendamustine and rituximab
Determine the objective response rate (ORR = CR + PR) to a regimen of SDX-105 plus rituximab in patients with relapsed indolent or mantle cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 4-6 months
• To characterize the safety profile of SDX-105 plus rituximab in this patient population • To determine the one-year and Kaplan-Meier estimates of progression-free survival (PFS) rates • To determine the median duration of response (DR), 4-6 months
