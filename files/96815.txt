Personalized Tumor Neoantigen mRNA Therapy for Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This study is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of personalized tumor neoantigen mRNA therapy iNeo-Vac-R01 combined with PD-1 monoclonal antibody, anti-VEGFR monoclonal antibody and TACE regimen for the treatment of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.
Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)
PROCEDURE: TACE|DRUG: Sintilimab combined with Bevacizumab|BIOLOGICAL: individualized anti-tumor new antigen iNeo-Vac-R01 injection
Adverse events, According to the Commonly Used Adverse Event Criteria (CTCAE version 5.0), the number of subjects with adverse events and/or dose-limiting toxicity was counted as an indicator of the safety and tolerable dose of iNeo-Vac-R01 injection., The evaluation period was the dosing observation period and the safety follow-up period (21±3 days after the last dose).
Objective response rate (ORR), Up to 2 years|Disease control rate (DCR), Up to 2 years|Conversion rate, the proportion of patients with initially inoperable tumors who are successfully converted to patients who can undergo radical surgical resection after systemic treatment in conversion therapy, Up to 2 years|Progression-free survival （PFS）, Up to 2 years|Overall survival (OS), Up to 2 years|Progression-free survival Rate（1-Y-PFS%, 2-Y-PFS%,3-Y-PFS%）, Up to 3 years|Overall Survival Rate (1-Y-OS%,2-Y-OS%,3-Y-OS%), Up to 3 years
