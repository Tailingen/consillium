Hypofractionated Imrt (Vmat-Ra) For Elderly Patients With Newly Diagnosed High Grade Glioma
To assess the effect of IMRT using VMAT rapidarc approach, followed by adjuvant temozolomide on survival and quality of life in elderly, poor performance status patients with newly diagnosed HGG.
Glioma
RADIATION: Radiation
PFS, Progression free survival, one year
OS, Overall Survival, one year
Toxicity, Incidence of hematologic and non hematologic severe toxicities (grade III/ IV) will evaluate using NCI-CTCA scale. Late toxicity will evaluate using CTCA 4.2, one year|QoL, Quality of Life, one year
Investigators designed this study with the aim to assess the effect of IMRT using VMAT rapidarc approach, followed by adjuvant temozolomide on survival and quality of life in elderly, poor performance status patients with newly diagnosed HGG. The potential advantage of this approach is deliver a more selective irradiation to tumor's target with reducing the dose to normal brain and to allow the delivery of a higher dose, optimizing the therapeutic window.
