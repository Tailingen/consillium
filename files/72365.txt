Study of ctDNA as Prognostic Factor on Resectable Stage IIIA NSCLC Patients Treated With Neoadjuvant Treatment
This is an observational, prospective, multicentre and nationwide study.

The study enroll resectable stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer patients that are going to receive neoadjuvant treatment in real world.

The primary objective of this study is evaluating whether there is a significant association between ctDNA clearance (no detection of ctDNA) after neoadjuvant treatment and before surgery and progression free survival.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer Stage III|Neoadjuvant Treatment
To evaluate whether there is a significant association between ctDNA clearance after neoadjuvant treatment and before surgery and progression free survival (PFS)., To assess the association between the baseline ctDNA and ctDNA clearance with each one of the three outcomes: after neoadjuvant treatment, before surgery and PFS, From date of end of neoadjuvant treatment and before surgery until the date of progression free survival, assessed up to 24 months
To evaluate whether there is a significant association between ctDNA clearance after neoadjuvant treatment and before surgery and overall survival., To assess the association between the baseline ctDNA and ctDNA clearance with each one of the three outcomes: after neoadjuvant treatment, before surgery and Overall Survival, From date of end of neoadjuvant treatment and before surgery until the date of death, assessed up to 24 months|To evaluate whether there is a significant association between ctDNA clearance and pathological complete response or major pathologic response., To assess the association between the baseline ctDNA and ctDNA clearance with each one of the two outcomes: after complete response or major pathologic response (MPR)., From the end of neoadjuvant treatment and before surgery until the death of complete response or MPR, assessed up to 24 months|To identify somatic mutations in ctDNA that predispose to a better/worse overall survival, To identify somatic mutations in ctDNA in the pre-treatment plasma that predispose to a better/worse overall survival., From the date of extraction of blood in pretreatment period until the date of major pathologic response or death, assessed up to 24 months
This is an observational, multicenter, one-arm, non-comparative, prospective study that will not under any circumstances interfere in the physician's normal clinical practice. Being limited to the collection of blood samples at five times and patient data, it does not entail any diagnostic or therapeutic procedure outside of normal clinical practice.

Approximately 100 resectable stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer patients that are going to receive neoadjuvant treatment in real world will be recruited for this study in Spain. With this figure, it can be estimated whether ctDNA, both baseline and its negativization, has a role as a prognostic marker in the evolution of these patients in real-life conditions.

The primary objective of this study is evaluate whether there is a significant association between ctDNA clearance (no detection of ctDNA) after neoadjuvant treatment and before surgery and progression free survival.

The study is planned with the recruitment of patients over a year to a follow-up of 36 months post-surgery.
