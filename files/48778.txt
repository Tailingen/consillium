JYB1907 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors
A Phase I, Multi-center, Open-label Study with Dose-escalation and Multiple Expansion Cohorts to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Preliminary Antitumor Activity of JYB1907 in Subjects with Advanced Solid Tumors

DRUG: JYB1907
Adverse events, Adverse events, and changes from baseline in vital signs,etc., until either 28 days after last dose of study drug or initiation of new anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first.
Serum concentrations of JYB1907, JYB1907 assessed by pre-specified methods, and related pharmacokinetic parameters analysis, until 28 days after last dose of study drug|Serum concentrations of Immunogenicity Analysis, immunogenicity of JYB1907 assessed by pre-specified methods, and related immunogenic features analysis, until 28 days after last dose of study drug|Serum concentrations of Preliminary antitumor activity, To evaluate the preliminary antitumor activity of JYB1907 in patients with advanced solid tumors assessed by Recist1.1, until 28 days after last dose of study drug
Dose escalation This part is meant to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, immunogenicity, preliminary antitumor activity, the MTD and RP2D of JYB1907 in patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced solid tumors.

Expansion cohort The antitumor activity, safety, tolerability, PK and immunogenicity of JYB1907 will be further evaluated in other cohorts.
