The Prognosis of Colorectal Cancer Patients After Indocyanine Green Fluorescence-guided Radical Surgery
Previous studies of Indocyanine green (ICG) in colorectal surgery have focused on lymphatic mapping, lymph node detection, and the number of harvested lymph nodes. However, relatively few studies have evaluated the outcomes of this imaging technology, especially the prognosis following of colorectal cancer resection. The present study assessed the prognosis of colorectal cancer patients following ICG fluorescence-guided surgery as compared to conventional surgery without the use of ICG Fluorescence imaging
