Intracorporeal Versus Extracorporeal Anastomotic After Laparoscopic Right Colectomy
Background: Laparoscopic assisted right hemicolectomy is recommended for right colon cancer. As a more minimally invasive procedure, intracorporeal ileocolic anastomosis has potential advantages: reducing torsion and traction on the mesentery, reducing skin incision length and enhancing postoperative recovery. However, the longer operative time, greater risk of intra-abdominal infection and steep learning curve for intestinal anastomosis performed under laparoscopic conditions, does this increase the incidence of postoperative complications, especially the incidence of anastomotic leakage, and whether it affects There is no high-level research evidence on the survival of patients.

Study design: COlOR IV study is an international prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled clinical study of intraperitoneal anastomosis versus extraperitoneal anastomosis after laparoscopic right hemicolectomy for colon cancer . The study will include a quality assessment phase before randomisation to ensure required competency level and uniformity of the intracorporeal and extracoporeal techniques.

Endpoint: Primary outcome is anastomotic leakage within 30 days after surgery. Main secondary endpoint is 3-year disease-free survival rate. Secondary endpoints are mortality and morbidity, postoperative recovery, overall survival, surgical specimen quality, quality of life.

Statistics: The primary endpoint is anastomotic leakage within 30 days after surgery. The anastomotic leakage rate was set to 2% in the both groups, and an increase in the incidence of anastomotic leakage of 2.5% was considered inferior. The one-sided significance level was 0.025, the power was 0.9. The dropout rate was 20%, and taking into account the post-randomization analysis (dropout 5%), the total sample size was 1158. There were 579 cases in the intracorporeal anastomosis group and 579 cases in the extracorporeal anastomosis group.

Main selection: Patients with histologically proven right colon cancer (cecum, ascending colon and proximal 1/3 of the transverse colon malignant tumor), clinically stage I-III, and intention for right hemicolectomy with primary anastomosis.

Hypothesis: The hypothesis is that intracoporeal anastomosis will have comparable anastomotic leak rate and 3-year DFS, but faster postoperative recovery with extracoporeal anastomosis.

PROCEDURE: Intracorporeal anastomotic after LRC|PROCEDURE: Extracorporeal anastomotic after LRC
Anastomotic leak, Anastomotic leakage is defined as a defect of the intestinal wall at the anastomotic site leading to a communication between intra- and extraluminal compartments.

Diagnosis of anastomotic leakage: The radiological examination (CT abdomen) will be completed if clinically suspected AL. AL is confirmed clinically, radiologically, endoscopically or intraoperatively. The severity of anastomotic leakage was judged with reference to the Clavien-Dindo classification., 30 days

The VAS consists of a 10cm line, with two end points representing 0 ('no pain') and 10 ('pain as bad as it could possibly be'). Ask the patient to rate their current level of pain by placing a mark on the line., 1-3 days|Time to first flatus passage after surgery, The day of surgery is day 0.

These are coded with four-point scales, namely "Not at all", "A little", "Quite a bit" and "Very much.", 1 year|health-related quality of life, EQ 5D-5L (Euroqol): This questionnaire is a simple, generic tool for describing and assessing health-related quality of life. It consists of 5 items (mobility, personal care, activities of daily living, pain and anxiety and depression) that answer questions on a 5-point scale ranging from "no problem" (level 1) to "very severe" (level 5)., 1 year|Incision herniation, The incision herniation is classified by the criteria of the European Hernia Society.
