Phase II Study of Concomitant Intensity-modulated Radiotherapy Combined to Capecitabine, Mitomycin and Panitumumab in Patients With Stage II-IIIB Squamous-cell Carcinoma of the Anal Canal
There is increasing evidence of a role of EGFR, treatment with EGFR-inhibitors in anal cancer and synergies of EGFR-inhibitors with radiotherapy. Addition of the human anti-EGFR antibody Panitumumab to chemoradiotherapy seems therefore solidly justified. This trial investigates concurrent panitumumab/capecitabine/mitomycin concurrent to IMRT-radiotherapy. Treatment components used in this study have been selected on scientific rationale. The trial regimen should be feasible with acceptable toxicity and outcome similar to historic series.

PFS is defined as the interval (days) between registration and the date of progression (based on the actual tumor assessment date), or death for any cause, whichever comes first. The death of a patient without a reported progression will be considered as an event on the date of death. Patients who have neither progressed nor died will be censored on the date of last evaluable tumor assessment. Patients who had no post-baseline assessments and did not have an event will be censored at the time of registration., 2 and 5 years|Tolerability and safety profile of this regimen., Toxicities will be assessed according to the NCI-CTCAE (version 4.0)., Early (6 weeks after treatment) and late (up to 2 and 5 years after treatment).|Role of PET for staging and outcome prediction., Predictive value of PET for PFS.

OBJECTIVES:

Primary:

-To assess efficacy of treatment regimen composed of capecitabine, mitomycin, panitumumab, and radiotherapy in terms of locoregional control rate in patients with stage II-IIIB squamous-cell carcinoma of the anal canal.

Secondary:

* To further assess efficacy of this regimen based on complete response (CR) rate, colostomy-free survival, functional colostomy-free survival, overall survival (OS), and progression-free survival (PFS).
* To assess the tolerability and safety profile of this regimen.
* To assess the role of PET for staging and outcome prediction (for those patients who had PET following local standards).
