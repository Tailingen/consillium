A Study of Carboplatin Plus Etoposide With or Without Atezolizumab in Participants With Untreated Extensive-Stage (ES) Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC)
This randomized, Phase I/III, multicenter, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of atezolizumab (anti-programmed death-ligand 1 \[PD-L1\] antibody) in combination with carboplatin plus (+) etoposide compared with treatment with placebo + carboplatin + etoposide in chemotherapy-naive participants with ES-SCLC. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either atezolizumab + carboplatin + etoposide or placebo + carboplatin + etoposide on 21-day cycles for four cycles in the induction phase followed by maintenance with atezolizumab or placebo until progressive disease (PD) as assessed by the investigator using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). Treatment can be continued until persistent radiographic PD or symptomatic deterioration.
Small Cell Lung Carcinoma
DRUG: Atezolizumab (MPDL3280A), an engineered anti-PD-L1 antibody|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Etoposide|DRUG: Placebo
Duration of Progression-Free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by the Investigator Using RECIST v1.1 in the Global Population, Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as at least 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions compared to baseline, or unequivocal progression in non-target lesion(s), or the appearance of new lesion(s)., Baseline until PD or death, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 23 months)|Duration of Overall Survival (OS) in the Global Population, OS is defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause., Baseline until death from any cause (up to approximately 23 months)
Percentage of Participants With Objective Response Rate (ORR) as Assessed by the Investigator Using RECIST v1.1 in the Global Population, Objective response (OR) is defined as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1., Baseline until partial response (PR) or complete response (CR), whichever occurs first (up to approximately 23 months)|Duration of Response (DOR) as Assessed by the Investigator Using RECIST v1.1 in the Global Population, DOR is defined as the time interval from first occurrence of a documented objective response to the time of disease progression as determined by the investigator using RECIST v1.1 or death from any cause, whichever comes first., First occurrence of PR or CR until PD or death, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 23 months)|PFS Rate at 6 Months and at 1 Year in Global Population, PFS rates at 6 months and at 1 year is defined as the proportion of participants who are alive without disease progression 6 months and 1 year after randomization, respectively., 6 months, 1 year|OS Rate at 1 Year and 2 Years in the Global Population, OS rates at 1 and 2 years is defined as the proportion of participants who are alive 1 year and 2 years after randomization, respectively., 1 year, 2 years|Time to Deterioration (TTD) Per European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ) Core 30 (C30) and Supplemental Lung Cancer Module (QLQ-LC13) in the Global Population, TTD according to the EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-LC13 measures were evaluated in each of the following linearly transformed symptom scores: cough, dyspnea (single item), dyspnea (multi-item subscale), chest pain, or arm/shoulder pain. The linear transformation gives each individual symptom subscale a possible score of 0 to 100. For the symptom to be considered "deteriorated," a score increase of ≥10 points above baseline must be held for at least two consecutive assessments or an initial score increase of ≥10 points is followed by death within 3 weeks from the last assessment. A ≥ 10-point change in the symptoms subscale score is perceived by participants as clinically significant., Baseline until deterioration per symptom subscale (up to approximately 23 months)|Percentage of Participants With at Least One Adverse Event in the Global Population, The percentage of participants with at least one adverse event in the global population., Baseline until up to 90 days after end of treatment (up to approximately 49 months)|Percentage of Participants With Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADA) to Atezolizumab in the Global Population, The baseline prevalence and post-baseline incidence of ADAs against atezolizumab., Predose (0 hours [H]) on Day (D) 1 of Cycles (C) 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 16, and every 8 cycles (Q8C) thereafter (cycle = 21 days) until treatment discontinuation (up to 23 months) and 120 days after last dose (up to approximately 23 months overall)|Maximum Observed Serum Concentration (Cmax) of Atezolizumab in the Global Population, Atezolizumab maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax; 30 minutes following the end of the atezolizumab infusion) for each respective day., Post-dose Day 1 of Cycle 1 (cycle length = 21 days)|Minimum Observed Serum Concentration (Cmin) of Atezolizumab in the Global Population, Atezolizumab pre-dose plasma concentration (Cmin) for each respective day., Predose on Day 1 of Cycles 1, 3, 4, 8, 16 and 24 (cycle length = 21 days)|Plasma Concentration of Carboplatin in the Global Population, Plasma concentration of carboplatin in the Global population., Predose, before end of infusion, and after end of carboplatin infusion on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and Cycle 3 (cycle = 21 days)|Plasma Concentration of Etoposide in the Global Population, Plasma concentration of etoposide in the Global Population., Predose, before end of infusion, 1 and 4 hours after end of carboplatin infusion on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and Cycle 3 (cycle = 21 days)
