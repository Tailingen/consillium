Effects of Incomplete ERAS on Clinical Outcomes in Patients With Colorectal Cancer
Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) has been reported to be associated with improved outcomes in many studies, most of which involve short-term effects. Only a few studies have reported the long-term effects of highly compliant ERAS. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no large-scale comparisons between incomplete ERAS (compliance \< 70%) and non-ERAS. The aim of this comparative study is to analyze and evaluate the long-term outcomes of incomplete ERAS in laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery.
