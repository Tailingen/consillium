Engaging Clinical Champions to Improve HPV Vaccination
This trial will compare two ways to improve communication about HPV vaccination in primary care. The research team will work with primary care clinics. Some clinics will receive communication training from an outside expert. Other clinics will receive the same training from a vaccine champion from their healthcare system.

BEHAVIORAL: Champion Announcement Approach Training|BEHAVIORAL: Traditional Announcement Approach Training
HPV vaccination (â‰¥1 dose), 9-12 year olds, Proportion of unvaccinated children who initiate the HPV vaccine series between baseline and 12-month follow-up, among those who were ages 9-12 at baseline, from baseline to 12 months
HPV vaccination (2 doses), 9-12 year olds, Proportion of unvaccinated children who complete the HPV vaccine series between baseline and 12-month follow-up, among those who were ages 9-12 at baseline, from baseline to 12 months
The researchers will conduct a cluster randomized non-inferiority trial. The trial will compare two ways of delivering a communication workshop called Announcement Approach Training (AAT). AAT is designed to improve communication about HPV vaccination in primary care. The researchers will randomize clinics within participating healthcare systems. Some clinics will receive the training from an outside expert. Other clinics will receive the same training from a vaccine champion from their own system. The researchers will use medical record data to compare changes in HPV vaccination among children ages 9-12. Clinics will be followed for 12 months. The study will engage clinical staff. Researchers will not have direct contact with children or their families.
