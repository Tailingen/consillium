Venetoclax in Combination With Azacitidine (VEN/AZA) Followed by Donor Lymphocyte Infusion (DLI) for Patients With Very High-Risk Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Undergoing Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplant (HCT)
The purpose of this study is to see the effects of an investigational combination treatment of venetoclax, azacitidine, and donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) in patients with high-risk AML receiving allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, and to assess if the combination treatment is well tolerated and prevents disease relapse after transplant.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Venetoclax|DRUG: Azacitidine|BIOLOGICAL: Donor Lymphocyte Infusion
Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D), The RP2D of VEN/AZA therapy will be determined as the maximum tolerated dose of study treatment as assessed by treating physician using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0., Up to 13 months|Number of Participants Experiencing Treatment-Related Toxicity, The number of participants experiencing treatment-related toxicity. Toxicity is defined as including dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse events (AEs) in study participants after starting study therapy. Toxicity will be assessed using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0, per physician discretion., Up to 13 months
Recurrence-Free Survival (RFS), Recurrence-free survival (RFS) is defined as the elapsed time measured in months between the treatment start date (Cycle 1 Day 1) and date of documented disease recurrence or death from any cause. Alive patients without recurrence will be censored at the date of last documentation of recurrence-free status., Up to 24 months|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the elapsed time measured in months between the treatment start date (Cycle 1 Day 1) and date of death from any cause. Alive patients will be censored at the date last known to be alive., Up to 24 months|Proportion of Participants with Treatment-Related Mortality (TRM), Treatment-related Mortality (TRM) is defined as the proportion of participants that died after starting study therapy, during the time of observation and in the absence of disease progression., 180 days|Number of Participants with acute GVHD After Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplant (HCT), The number of participants with acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) among study participants will be reported at +100 and +180 days post-allogeneic HCT., Up to 180 days|Number of Participants with chronic GVHD After Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplant (HCT), The number of participants with chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) among study participants will be reported at one (1) year post-allogeneic HCT., 1 year
