EUS-RFA for Unresectable Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma
the study evaluate the efficacy and safety of EUS-RFA using Habib EUS-RFA catheter with a prospective randomised trial in patients with inoperable PDAC.
Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Non-resectable
PROCEDURE: Endoscopic ultrasound guided radiofrequency ablation|RADIATION: chemoradiotherapy
Change in tumour size as measured on EUS and or CT, The tumor size was compared before and after 60 days EUS-RFA, 60 days|Change in serum levels of Ca 19-9, Serum levels of Ca 19-9 was compared before and after 60 days EUS-RFA, 60 days
Overall survival at 6 months, Survival rate 6 months after EUS-RFA, 6 months|Overall survival at 12 months, Survival rate 12 months after EUS-RFA, 12 months
The five year survival for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is less than 5% in spite of the advances in management of cancers in the last few decades. Endobiliary application of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been developed in our unit and used in patients with unresectable bile duct and pancreatic head adenocarcinomas presenting with biliary obstruction. Various techniques of EUS-guided tumour ablation have been described, including RF ablation, photodynamic therapy, laser ablation, and ethanol injection. Endoscopic ultrasound guided RFA (EUS-RFA) of the pancreatic head using Habib EUS-RFA catheter through a 19-gauge needle was well tolerated in 5 Yucatan pigs and with minimum amount of pancreatitis .
