KEYMAKER-U01 Substudy 01A: Efficacy and Safety Study of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) With or Without Chemotherapy When Used With Investigational Agents in Treatment-naïve Participants With Stage IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) (MK-3475-01A/KEYMAKER-U01A)
The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) with or without chemotherapy in combination with vibostolimab (MK-7684), boserolimab (MK-5890), MK-4830, MK-0482, I-DXd, or HER3-DXd in treatment-naïve participants with advanced squamous or non-squamous NSCLC.

This study is one of the pembrolizumab substudies being conducted under one pembrolizumab umbrella master protocol (MK-3475-U01/KEYMAKER-U01).

Part A: Objective Response Rate (ORR) According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who had a Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: ≥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1. ORR will be reported., Up to approximately 24 months|Part B: Number of Participants Who Experience One or More Adverse Events (AEs), An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, disease, or worsening of preexisting condition temporally associated with study treatment and irrespective of causality to study treatment. The number of participants who experience an AE will be reported., Up to approximately 27 months|Part B: Number of Participants Who Discontinue Study Intervention Due to an Adverse Event (AE), An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, disease, or worsening of preexisting condition temporally associated with study treatment and irrespective of causality to study treatment. The number of participants who discontinue study intervention due to an AE will be reported., Up to approximately 24 months|Part B: Number of Participants Who Experience a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), A DLT is defined as an event with toxicity including the type, severity, time of onset, time of resolution, and the probable association with study treatment that are not due to pre-existing conditions as defined by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0 (CTCAE 5.0). Number of participants who experience a DLT per CTCAE 5.0 will be reported., Up to approximately 3 Weeks
Part A: Progression-Free Survival (PFS) According to RECIST 1.1, PFS is defined as the time from first dose of study treatment until either the earliest date of documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD is defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD. PFS will be reported., Up to approximately 24 months|Part A: Number of Participants Who Experience One or More AEs, An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, disease, or worsening of preexisting condition temporally associated with study treatment and irrespective of causality to study treatment. The number of participants who experience an AE will be reported., Up to approximately 27 months|Part A: Number of Participants Who Discontinue Study Treatment Due to an AE, An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, disease, or worsening of preexisting condition temporally associated with study treatment and irrespective of causality to study treatment. The number of participants who discontinue study intervention due to an AE will be reported., Up to approximately 24 months|Part B: ORR per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who had a Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: ≥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1. ORR will be reported., Up to approximately 24 months|Part B: Duration of Response (DOR) per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR, For participants who show confirmed CR or PR, DOR is defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. DOR will be reported., Up to approximately 24 months|Part B: Cmax of I-DXd, Cmax is the maximum concentration of the drug observed in plasma. Blood samples collected pre dose and at multiple timepoints post dose will be used to determine Cmax of I-DXd., At designated time points up to approximately 2 years|Part B: Cmax of HER3-DXd, Cmax is the maximum concentration of the drug observed in plasma. Blood samples collected pre dose and at multiple timepoints post dose will be used to determine Cmax of HER3-DXd., At designated time points up to approximately 2 years|Part B: Cmax of pembrolizumab, Cmax is the maximum concentration of the drug observed in serum. Blood samples collected pre dose and at multiple timepoints post dose will be used to determine Cmax of pembrolizumab., At designated time points up to approximately 2 years|Part B: Ctrough of I-DXd, Ctrough is defined as the lowest observed concentration of drug in plasma at the end of the dosing interval. Blood samples collected pre dose and at multiple timepoints post dose will be used to determine Ctrough of I-DXd., At designated time points up to approximately 2 years|Part B: Ctrough of HER3-DXd, Ctrough is defined as the lowest observed concentration of drug in plasma at the end of the dosing interval. Blood samples collected pre dose and at multiple timepoints post dose will be used to determine Ctrough of HER3-DXd., At designated time points up to approximately 2 years|Part B: Ctrough of pembrolizumab, Ctrough is defined as the lowest observed concentration of drug in serum at the end of the dosing interval. Blood samples collected pre dose and at multiple timepoints post dose will be used to determine Ctrough of pembrolizumab., At designated time points up to approximately 2 years
