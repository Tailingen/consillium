Phase I Dose-escalation Study of Fractionated 177Lu-PSMA-617 for Progressive Metastatic CRPC
The purpose of this study is to find the highest dose level of the study drug, 177Lu-PSMA-617 that can be given without severe side effects for advanced prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: 177Lu-PSMA-617|DRUG: 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC
Number of Subjects With Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) of Fractionated Dose of 177Lu-PSMA-617, Proportion of subjects experiencing a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of fractionated dose of 177Lu-PSMA-617 by using 3+3 dose escalation was assessed., Assessed throughout the DLT period, up to 92 days after starting study drug.|Number of Subjects That Achieved Cumulative Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) Phase II Dose of 177Lu-PSMA-617, This outcome is measuring the number of subjects that achieved MTD. MTD is defined as the highest dose level with an observed incidence of DLT in no more than one out of six patients treated at a particular dose level. If no DLTs were experienced, then a recommended phase II dose was determined in 2-wk dose-fractionation regimen by using a 3+3 dose escalation design, as no MTD was observed., from first dose of study drug to at least 12 weeks of subsequent follow-up evaluations, up to 92 days|Recommended Phase II Dose of 177Lu-PSMA-617 in a 2-week Dose-fractionation Regimen, Recommended Phase II dose was determined based on the results of the Phase I portion of the study. Since no Maximum Tolerated Dose was achieved given that no Dose Limiting Toxicities occurred, the Recommended Phase II dose was determined based on the Cohort 5 dose., Duration of Phase I, up to 47 months
The Rate of PSA Decline Following Fractionated 177Lu-PSMA-617, Proportion of patients with PSA decline following treatment (fractionated 177Lu-PSMA-617) with the RP2D of fractionated dose 177Lu-PSMA-617 (Phase II). PSA response will be determined by comparing the PSA levels after therapy to the baseline, pre-treatment PSA., from baseline visit to short term follow up visit, approximately 6 months|Count of Patients That Had a Radiographic Response Rate Measured by RECIST 1.1 With PCWG3 Modifications, From start of study to progression of disease with at least 12 weeks of subsequent follow-up evaluations, up to 54 months|Progression-free Survival Measured by PCWG3 (Prostate Cancer Working Group3) Criteria, Progression Free Survival, with progression determined based by Radiographic and Biochemical response. Biochemical response was assessed by comparing the PSA levels after therapy to the baseline, pre-treatment PSA. Declines of ≥ 30% confirmed by a second PSA value ≥2 weeks later, are reported., Duration of time on study, from baseline to last follow up visit, up to 54 months|Number of CTC Count Responders, Changes in CTC count as measured by CellSearch and the rate of favorable CTC count and LDH at 12 weeks following fractionated 177Lu-PSMA-617.

All subjects in this study will get blood samples drawn (at screening and EOS visit) for CTC enumeration by CellSearch methodology. Participants whose CTC counts drop to less than 5 or stay below 5 (responders) vs. those who remain at least 5 or above (non-responders) at EOS visit are analyzed., Duration of study, from screening to EOS visit, up to 12 weeks|Overall Survival Following Fractionated 177Lu-PSMA-617, Overall survival was defined as the time from start of 177Lu-PSMA-617 to the date of death from any cause, or last date of follow up., Up to 5 years|Count of Participants That Experience an Adverse Event, From screening to end of study visit, up to 54 months
Phase I dose escalation study with 177Lu-PSMA-617 using dose fractionation regimen will be performed in patients with documented progressive metastatic CRPC. The cumulative 177Lu dose \[100 mCi (3.7 GBq) - 600 mCi (22.2 GBq)\] will be escalated in up to 6 different dose levels (3 + 3 study design). Additional 10 subjects will be enrolled at the MTD dose level to further assess safety and tolerability and to obtain a preliminary assessment of efficacy. The study will enroll adult males 18 years of age or older with documented progressive metastatic CRPC. The primary objectives are: - To determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of fractionated dose of 177Lu-PSMA-617 - To determine the maximal tolerated and recommended phase II dose of 177Lu-PSMA-617 in a 2-week dose-fractionation regimen Subjects will receive the following study interventions:

1. 177Lu-PSMA-617 \[50mCi (1.85GBq) - 300mCi (11.1GBq)\] intravenous X2 doses, 2 weeks apart (Visit 1 and 2)
2. 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC \[5 ±2mCi or 185 ±74MBq\] intravenous during screening and at 12 weeks with standard imaging Subjects will be on this study from screening to end of study (day 85).

The treatment phase comprises of 8 visits over 12 weeks. Patients will be followed until death for survival assessment. Patients removed from study for unacceptable adverse events will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event. All tests and procedures performed on this study are routine and standard of care except: 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC PET/CT scan, administration of investigational agent 177Lu-PSMA-617, research blood samples (CTCs for research, cell-free DNA sample), and PSMA testing on archive tissue.
