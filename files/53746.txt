Contrast-Enhanced Digital Mammography (CEDM) for Identifying a Change in Management of Women With Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer
Enrolled women will undergo a bilateral Contrast-Enhanced Breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CE-BMRI) as per usual clinical practice within 30 days of breast cancer diagnosis. Up to 8 weeks after the CE-BMRI exam, subjects will undergo a Dual Energy Contrast Enhanced Digital Mammograph (DE-CEDM).

Completion of CE-BMRI and DE-CEDM, Subjects have completed both CE-BMRI and DE-CEDM scan types, Approximately 8 weeks|Average Maximum Lesion Size by CE-BMRI Scan, Average maximum lesion size when scanned using CE-BMRI, Within 1 week of CE-BMRI scan|Average Maximum Lesion Size by DE-CEDM, Average maximum lesion size when scanned using DE-CEDM, Within 1 week of DE-CEDM scan|Average Maximum Lesion Size by Histology Outcome, Average maximum lesion size as described in histology report., Approximately 1 week; upon completion of histology report|Multi-reader Evaluation of Images, Multi-reader evaluation of images and comparison between CE-BMRI vs. DE-CEDM to determine which technology can more precisely measure cancer size as determined by pathological examination was planned. This was not conducted due to premature stop of the study., This outcome did not occur due to premature study stop.
Enrolled women will undergo a bilateral Contrast-Enhanced Breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CE-BMRI) as per usual clinical practice within 30 days of breast cancer diagnosis. Up to 8 weeks after the CE-BMRI exam, subjects will undergo a Dual Energy Contrast Enhanced Digital Mammograph (DE-CEDM). Maximum lesion size was compared between the two imaging types. Subject data from both scans was planned to be included in a multi-reader evaluation; however, due to premature stop of the study, multi-reader data was not collected.
