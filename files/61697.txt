Disparities in incidence and mortality between African Americans and Caucasians for a number of cancers have been well documented. This study builds on previous work in St. Louis to overcome barriers to access to breast screening, identifying and addressing factors associated with access to care once diagnosed, and factors contributing to delay in diagnosis and completion of therapy. African American breast cancer patients randomly assigned to the intervention arm of the trial will have access to the Survivor Stories Tablet, a tablet computer, on which they will browse an archive of 1-3 minute videotaped survivor stories about five topics: coping, relationships, experiences with the health care system, follow-up care, and quality of life (QOL) living with breast cancer. Patients will have the tablet for two weeks after enrollment in the study, and again at 6 and 12 months. Patients in the control arm will receive usual care.
