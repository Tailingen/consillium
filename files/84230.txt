Study of SHR-1210 Combined With Apatinib in the Treatment of Sarcoma
To observe the effectiveness of SHR-1210 (Camrelizumab) combined with apatinib in the treatment of unresectable sarcoma patients with chemotherapy failure. The main observations were progression-free survival (PFS) and progression-free control rate (PFR), followed by objective response rate (ORR) (CR+PR), disease control rate (DCR) (CR+PR+SD), and overall survival (OS).

Sarcoma
DRUG: Camrelizumab,|DRUG: Apatinib
Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the length of time from random assignment to disease progression or to death resulting from any cause other than the progress., Within 2 years
Disease control rate (DCR）, nvestigators will assess treatment response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1（RECIST1.1）, Within 2 years|Objective tumor response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of subjects having achieved confirmed Complete Response + Partial Response as best overall response according to radiological assessments., Within 2 years|Overall survival(OS), OS is defined as the length of time from random assignment to death or to last contact., Within 3 years
