A Double-Blind Placebo Controlled Study To Determine the Optimal Immunopharmacological Dose Level of Isoprinosine in Immunodepressed Volunteers
The objective of this double-blind placebo-controlled study is to evaluate the effect of Isoprinosine in a group of homogenous male volunteers who present with immunologic defects relative to:

* Comparison of total helper and suppressor T-cell number between the groups.
* Comparison of the phytohemagglutinins (PHA) and concanavalin A lymphoproliferative response and natural killer (NK) cell activity between the groups.
* Determination of the clinical course of the volunteers after discontinuance of Isoprinosine.
