Study of Sequential Systemic Therapy + Intraperitoneal Paclitaxel in Gastric/GEJ Peritoneal Carcinomatosis
This is a phase II clinical trial assessing the safety and efficacy of sequential systemic and intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy in patients with primary gastric/gastroesophageal junction cancer with cytology positive peritoneal lavage and/or peritoneal carcinomatosis.

Participants with Progression Free Survival at 1-Year, Progression-free survival is defined as the duration of time from start of systemic treatment to time of progression, death, or clinical deterioration attributed to disease progression as judged by the investigator. Radiographic progression is defined using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) as a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm and/or appearance of new lesions., 1 year|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events [Safety], To evaluate the safety of IP paclitaxel and IV paclitaxel, 5-FU, and leucovorin in patients with primary gastric/GEJ adenocarinoma with peritoneal carcinomatosis determined by the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events. Adverse events are based on the CTCAE (NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) Version 5.0., From date of study treatment initiation to first date of disease progression, toxicity, delay of treatment, or withdrawal of treatment, assessed up to 12 months after the last patient is enrolled.
Overall Survival of Participants, To assess the overall survival of participants from the start of systemic treatment to the death from any cause., From initiation of systemic treatment to up to 12 months after last patient is enrolled or until death from any cause.|Patient Reported Quality of Life Outcomes, To assess the quality of life of participants such as mobility, self-care, daily activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression and a visual analog scale (VAS). VAS consists of endpoints labeled best imaginable health status at the top and worse imaginable health state at the bottom having numeric values of 100 and 0 respectively., From initiation of study treatment until patient is off study, assessed up to 12 months after the last patient has started treatment.
Expression of Plasma and Ascites Exosomal Gene Signature (EXOSIG), To assess the expression of plasma and ascites exosomal gene signature (EXO SIG) in patients with gastric cancer peritoneal carcinomatosis compared to healthy controls., From date of registration to up to 12 months after last patient is enrolled.|Correlation of Plasma and Ascite Exosomal Gene Signature (EXOSIG) to Treatment Response, To assess the correlation of changes in exosomal gene signature to treatment response in patients with gastric cancer peritoneal carcinomatosis., From date of registration to up to 12 months after last patient is enrolled.
Patients with histologically proven primary gastric or gastroesophageal junction (Siewert 3) adenocarcinoma with positive peritoneal cytology or peritoneal carcinomatosis detected by laparoscopy, laparotomy or imaging and without evidence of distant organ metastasis will be eligible for this study. Patients will undergo systemic therapy for 3-4 months at the discretion of the medical oncologist based on molecular makers (PD-L1, HER -2 neu, MSI). Patients without distant organ metastatic progression after completion of systemic chemotherapy, will undergo diagnostic laparoscopy and IP port placement. IP regimen will consist of IV Paclitaxel, 5- FU and Leucovorin and IP Paclitaxel. Paclitaxel 40 mg/m2 will be instilled into the peritoneal cavity through the IP port on days 1 and 8, repeated every 21 days for 3 months (3-4 cycles). Restaging imaging with CT and /or diffusion weighted MRI with contrast will be obtained 4-6 weeks after completion of IP chemotherapy. Based on response and extent of disease, patients will be triaged to one of the following treatment plans: stable disease or response and PCI \>10 - continue IP chemotherapy regimen, progression - switch to second line regimen, response with PCI â‰¤ 10 and complete cytoreduction is feasible - consider cytoreduction surgery (CRS) with intraperitoneal chemotherapy (IPEC).
