After being informed about the study and potential risks, all patients giving written informed consent will undergo an up to 7 day screening period to determine eligibility for study entry. On Day 0, patients who meet the eligibility requirements will be enrolled in an open-label manner and will receive a loading dose of teverelix TFA (one subcutaneous (SC) injection in the abdomen and one intramuscular (IM) injection in the buttock). Patients will then receive maintenance doses of teverelix TFA (one SC injection in the abdomen) at 4- or 6-weekly intervals up to week 24. The patients will return for a final assessment 4 weeks after their last maintenance dose injection.

The initial dosing regimen to be tested (Group 1) is:

Loading Dose = 120 mg teverelix TFA SC + 120 mg teverelix TFA IM Maintenance Dose = 120 mg teverelix TFA SC every 6 weeks

If this dosing regimen is unsuccessful (more than 2 (of 20) patients fail treatment) then recruitment to Group 1 will end and enrollment in Group 2 will open.

The dosing regimen that may be tested (Group 2) is:

Loading Dose = 180 mg teverelix TFA SC + 180 mg teverelix TFA IM Maintenance Dose = 180 mg teverelix TFA SC every 6 weeks

If this dosing regimen is unsuccessful (more than 6 (of 60) patients fail treatment) then recruitment to Group 2 will end and the study will be terminated.
