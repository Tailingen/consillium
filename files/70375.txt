Trial of Anti-PD-1 Immunotherapy and Stereotactic Radiation in Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety/tolerability/feasibility of pembrolizumab and radiation therapy before surgical resection in patients with recurrent glioblastoma as defined by treatment-related AEs and the number of patients who do not necessitate a delay in surgical resection, and to assess overall survival. The secondary objectives are to assess progression free survival, and to assess the T cell clonality, CD8 T cell activation and Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocyte (TIL) score after treatment
Glioblastoma Multiforme
DRUG: Pembrolizumab|RADIATION: Stereotactic Radiation Therapy|PROCEDURE: Surgical Resection
Safety and tolerability measured by the incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events and grade 3 or above treatment related adverse events., Safety and tolerability measured by the incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events and grade 3 or above treatment related adverse events as assessed per CTCAE, Version 5.0., From start of study treatment until confirmation of disease progression, intolerable toxicities, withdrawal of consent. Assessed up to 2 years.|Overall survival, From start of study treatment until death, loss to follow-up, or withdrawal of consent. Subjects who are lost to survival follow-up will not be replaced, and public records may be accessed to assess Overall Survival., From start of study treatment until death, loss to follow-up, or withdrawal of consent. Assessed up to 2 years.
Progression free survival, From start of study treatment until confirmation of disease progression (per iRANO Criteria), intolerable toxicities, withdrawal of consent, or up to 2 years or 18 cycles of pembrolizumab, whichever comes first., From start of study treatment until until confirmation of disease progression, intolerable toxicities, withdrawal of consent. Assessed up to 2 years.|Immune action, To assess the T cell clonality, CD8 T cell activation and Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocyte (TIL) score after treatment. Blood draws for research purposes performed after obtaining consent but prior to neoadjuvant pembrolizumab administration, and at the time of initiation of SRT and at the time of surgery, At baseline, prior to stereotactic radiation therapy, and prior to surgery.
