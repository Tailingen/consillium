Multilevel HPV Self-Testing Intervention for the Increase of Cervical Cancer Screening Among Women in Appalachia
This trial studies how well a multilevel human papillomavirus (HPV) self-testing intervention works in increasing cervical cancer screening among women in Appalachia. Most cases of cervical cancer occur among unscreened and underscreened women. A multilevel HPV self-testing intervention may help to improve cervical cancer screening rates.

Effectiveness of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Intervention, The patient-level effectiveness will be whether or not women get "screened" during the project. Will examine the proportion of women screened, and use an intent-to-treat approach. To compare treatment groups (Group 1 versus Group 2), will use generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) to account for the correlation between women from the same health system., Up to 1 years
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

Determine the effectiveness of the intervention in increasing cervical cancer screening.

OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

GROUP I: Participants receive the HPV self-testing intervention consisting of mailed HPV self-test devices. Participants also receive an information about cervical cancer. Participants who do not return their self-test within a few weeks receive telephone-based patient navigation.

GROUP II: Participants receive usual care consisting of a reminder letter to get a clinic-based cervical cancer screening test and information about cervical cancer.
