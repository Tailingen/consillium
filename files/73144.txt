Modified-FOLFIRINOX Regimen Based Neoadjuvant Therapy in Chinese Patients With Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
FOLFIRINOX regimen is first-line neoadjuvant chemotherapies for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) worldwide. However, FOLFIRINOX is not well accepted in China because of the high prevalence of adverse events and poor tolerance. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of modified-FOLFIRINOX (mFOLFIRINOX) in Chinese LAPC patients and compare survival between LAPC patients with mFOLFIRINOX-based preoperative therapy and LAPC patients who underwent surgery alone.

At this institution, a mFOLFIRINOX regimen has been adopted for metastatic pancreatic cancer (MPC) patients and promising results obtained. The modification resulted in a significantly reduced prevalence of severe adverse events in MPC patients, whereas the OS and PFS were extended to 10.3m and 7.0m, respectively, which is similar to that for patients on a full-dose regimen. Therefore, the investigators further evaluated the efficacy of mFOLFIRINOX in LAPC patients. Here, investigators want to prospectively enroll LAPC patients who underwent preoperative therapy with mFOLFIRINOX from April 2014 and compared the surgical resectability and surgical morbidity/surgical mortality among patients with surgically resectable pancreatic cancer (RPC) or LAPC who underwent surgery alone retrospectively. For patients with LAPC, mFOLFIRINOX was administrated for several cycles until the optimal response was obtained and then patients were evaluated for surgery. Moreover, survival data, including OS and PFS, were determined.
