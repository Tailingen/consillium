Video/Audio Distraction Analgesia for Simulated Oncology Procedure Pain
The purpose of this study is to compare the analgesic efficacy of three different types of video/audio distraction in normal volunteers subjected to carefully controlled and non-injurious thermal pain delivered to the skin of the lower back, simulating discomfort of a lumbar puncture. Two of the distraction techniques include immersive virtual reality (VR). The most efficacious distraction technique will be used in a subsequent clinical study in cancer patients.
Pain
PROCEDURE: Virtual Reality distraction
To compare positional techniques and differing types of VR presentation (immersive vs. low tech). We will also compare age cohorts (18-21, 40-60, and older than 60 years)., upon completion of data collection
