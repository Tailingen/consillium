GRAVITAS-119: Itacitinib in Combination With Calcineurin Inhibitor-Based Interventions for the Prophylaxis of Graft-Versus Host Disease
The purpose of this study is to assess the impact and safety of itacitinib in combination with calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-based interventions for the prophylaxis of graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD).
Hematologic Malignancies
DRUG: Itacitinib|DRUG: Calcineurin inhibitor
Proportion of participants with hematologic recovery when itacitinib is added to GVHD prophylaxis treatment, Hematologic recovery defined as demonstrating both neutrophil recovery (ANC ≥ 500/mm\^3 for 3 consecutive measurements) and platelet recovery (platelet count ≥ 20,000/mm\^3 with no requirement for platelet transfusion in the preceding 3 days)., Day 28
