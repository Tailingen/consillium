Effect of Wound Infiltration by Ketamine Versus Dexmedetomidine Added to Bupivacaine on Surgical Stress
This study aims to compare the effects of local wound infiltration with ketamine versus dexmedetomidine when added to bupivacaine on stress response and postoperative pain in lower abdominal cancer surgery.
Abdominal Cancer
DRUG: Dexmedetomidine|DRUG: Ketamine|DRUG: Bupivacaine
Total morphine consumption, 24 hours
Plasma concentrations of prolactin, cortisol and glucose level, 24 hours|the severity of pain was assessed using VAS score, 24 hours
Patients will be randomly assigned using an online research randomizer into three groups, 30 patients in each group:

Group C:

30 patients receive local anesthetic wound infiltration with with 20 ml of bupivacaine 0.5 % diluted in 20 ml saline (total volume 40 ml) in two divided doses i.e. 20 ml is administered on each side of incision( control group).

Group K:

30 patients receive local anesthetic wound infiltration with with 20 ml of bupivacaine 0.5 % diluted in 20 ml saline +1 mg /kg ketamine (total volume 40 ml) in two divided doses i.e. 20 ml is administered on each side of incision.

Group D:

30 patients receive local anesthetic wound infiltration with with 20 ml of bupivacaine 0.5 % diluted in 20 ml saline + 1Âµg/kg dexmedetomidine (total volume 40 ml) in two divided doses i.e. 20 ml is administered on each side of incision.
