Efficacy and Safety of Pyrotinib in HER2 Positive Gastrointestinal Tumors
Targeting human epidermal factor receptor 2 (HER2) therapy have shown the anti-tumor efficacy in patients with HER2-positive gastrointestinal tumors. Pyrotinib is an irreversible small-molecule receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting both epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and HER2. This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Pyrotinib in patients with HER2 positive gastrointestinal tumors.

This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Pyrotinib in patients with HER2 positive gastrointestinal tumors. Three cohorts were designed for this trial. Cohort 1: patients with gastric cancer or esophageal adenocarcinoma receiving paclitaxel combined with pyrotinib for second-line therapy; Cohort 2: patients with gastric cancer or esophageal adenocarcinoma receiving pyrotinib monotherapy for third-line or posterior line therapy; Cohort 3: patients with colorectal cancer receiving pyrotinib combined with/without trastuzumab for third-line or posterior line therapy.
