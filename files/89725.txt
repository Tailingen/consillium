High Frequency Jet Ventilation for Percutaneous Interventional Radiology
Evaluate benefits of High Frequency Jet Ventilation compare to standard ventilation during general anesthesia in patient undergoing peri diaphragmatic percutaneous tumor ablation.

The investigators hypothesis that procedure is shorter and more accurate in High Frequency Jet Ventilation group reducing target movement induced by ventilation.
Percutaneous Tumor Ablation
PROCEDURE: Jet ventilation group|PROCEDURE: Standard ventilation group
Time to hit the target, Estimated the time for a puncture needle under High Frequency Jet Ventilation compared to the conventional mode of mechanical ventilation, during the procedure
