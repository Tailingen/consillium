NAUTILUS: OKI-179 Plus Binimetinib in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors in the RAS Pathway (Phase 1b) and NRAS-mutated Melanoma (Phase 2)
The NAUTILUS study is a Phase 1b/2, multi-center, open-label study in which patients with activating mutations in the RAS pathway (Phase 1b) and patients with NRAS-mutated Melanoma (Phase 2) will be treated with a combination of oral OKI-179 combined with the MEK inhibitor binimetinib.
RAS Mutation|NRAS Gene Mutation|Melanoma
DRUG: OKI-179 + binimetinib
Phase 1b: Incidence and severity of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), Incidence and severity of DLTs will be measured in the DLT-evaluable population during Cycle 1., First 28 days of treatment|Phase 1b: Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs), AEs will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0, Phase 1b study duration (approximately 1.5 years)|Phase 1b: Change in clinical laboratory abnormalities, Changes from baseline through study treatment will be analyzed using NCI CTCAE version 5.0 grade criteria, Baseline through 30 days after end of study treatment|Phase 1b: Change in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, Phase 1b study duration (approximately 1.5 years)|Phase 2: Objective response rate (ORR), Objective responses will be determined per RECIST version 1.1 criteria, and the ORR will be defined as the proportion of patients with the best overall confirmed response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) in the Efficacy-Evaluable Population, Phase 2 study duration (approximately 3 years)
Phase 1b: Peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of OKI-179 and OKI-006, PK parameters will be measured based on plasma concentration-time data of OKI-179 and OKI-006, First 28 days of treatment|Phase 1b: Area Under the Plasma Concentration vs. Time Curve (AUC) of OKI-179 and OKI-006, PK parameters will be measured based on plasma concentration-time data of OKI-179 and OKI-006, First 28 days of treatment|Phase 1b: Objective response rate (ORR), Objective responses will be determined per RECIST version 1.1 criteria, and the ORR will be defined as the proportion of patients with the best overall confirmed response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) in the Efficacy-Evaluable Population., Phase 1b study duration (approximately 1.5 years)|Phase 1b: Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), Clinical benefit will be defined as the best overall confirmed response of CR, PR or stable disease for at least 3 months. The CBR will be defined as the proportion of patients with clinical benefit in the Efficacy-Evaluable Population., Phase 1b study duration (approximately 1.5 years)|Phase 1b: Duration of Response (DOR), The DOR will be calculated for all patients achieving a confirmed CR or PR and will be defined as the time from first disease assessment of PR or CR (whichever is first recorded) to the end of response, defined as occurrence of PD, death due to any cause, or relapse from CR., Phase 1b study duration (approximately 1.5 years)|Phase 2: Peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of OKI-179 and OKI-006, PK parameters will be measured based on plasma concentration-time data of OKI-179 and OKI-006, First 28 days of treatment|Phase 2: Area Under the Plasma Concentration vs. Time Curve (AUC) of OKI-179 and OKI-006, PK parameters will be measured based on plasma concentration-time data of OKI-179 and OKI-006, First 28 days of treatment|Phase 2: Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival will be defined as the time from the first administration of OKI-179 to the date of progression or death due to any cause., Phase 2 study duration (approximately 3 years)|Phase 2: Clinical Benefit Rate, Clinical benefit will be defined as the best overall confirmed response of CR, PR or stable disease for at least 3 months. The CBR will be defined as the proportion of patients with clinical benefit in the Efficacy-Evaluable Population., Phase 2 study duration (approximately 3 years)|Phase 2: Duration of Response, The DOR will be calculated for all patients achieving a confirmed CR or PR and will be defined as the time from first disease assessment of PR or CR (whichever is first recorded) to the end of response, defined as occurrence of PD, death due to any cause, or relapse from CR., Phase 2 study duration (approximately 3 years)|Phase 2: Incidence and severity of AEs, AEs will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE version 5.0, Phase 2 study duration (approximately 3 years)
