Review of the Literature and Serie of Patients Who Underwent Reconstruction After Wide Local Excision of Nail Apparatus for Melanoma
Melanomas of the nail bed are often diagnosed at the locally advanced stage. The standard treatment was amputation of the finger or toe, but it has now been established that enlarged excision of the nail plate is sufficient under certain conditions. Reconstruction of the nail system can be performed by several techniques. Here, the investigators present a series of patients reconstructed by INTEGRA (dermal matrix) and skin graft
