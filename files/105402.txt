Efficacy and Safety of 177Lu-Dotatate PRRT in Metastatic GEP-NEN Patients
The purpose of the study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT) with 177Lu-Dotatate in patients with inoperable, progressive, somatostatin receptor-positive (SSTR+), neuroendocrine tumours of GEP-NEN

DRUG: 177Lu-Dotatate PRRT
Overall response rate (ORR), CT/MRI will be performed every 8 weeks for efficacy evaluation by RECIST 1.1 and CHOI, From date of first dose until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months|Incidence of Treatment-related Adverse Events（Safety and Tolerability）, Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, From date of first dose until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months
Progression-free survival, Progression-free survival is defined as the time from the date of first dose to the date of the first documented radiological progression or death due to any cause, baseline, every 8 weeks up to 1 year after last patient first treatment
