evaluate the validity of different GI societies recommendations applied in different GI endoscopy units on the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 nosocomial transmission and the overall impact of this recommendations on the service provided by each GI unit.

Target audience:

- Physicians performing advanced gastrointestinal endoscopies in different countries.

Objectives:

* Primary objective:

  1- To explore the status of advanced endoscopy (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and endoscopic ultrasound on a global level) in different endoscopy units all over the world, to report the characteristics of patients presented to these units and their procedure details.
* Secondary objectives:

  1. Effect of COVID-19 precautions on procedure time, procedure success, complications and patient outcomes
  2. Effect of COVID-19 on working time and staff number

Process:

A questionnaire containing advanced endoscopy procedure details in different countries will be distributed via emails. Responses will be collected in an online platform and data will be analyzed to reveal the effect of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on different aspects of advanced endoscopy practice in the studied countries.
