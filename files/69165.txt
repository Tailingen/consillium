Patient Understanding and Satisfaction Survey, The participant survey conducted at end of study was investigator-created and asked questions regarding demographics and medication taking behaviors. Questions specifically related to the calendar for those in the intervention arm were also asked.

Primary Objective: In order to evaluate the impact of such an approach on adherence, a prospective, open-label, randomized controlled pilot trial (RCT) was carried out to determine if a picture-based medication calendar would improve patient adherence to antiemetic medication regimens for adult patients receiving chemotherapy treatment for solid organ tumor origins.

The secondary objectives were: 1) to assess medication use and self-efficacy parameters, 2) to determine patient comfort with antiemetic regimen prescribed along with chemotherapy and 3) to determine patient satisfaction with the calendar study tool.
