A Phase 3 Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Efgartigimod IV in Patients With Acetylcholine Receptor Binding Antibody Seronegative Generalized Myasthenia Gravis
The primary purpose of this study is to measure the efficacy and safety of efgartigimod intravenously (IV) compared to placebo in participants with Acetylcholine Receptor Binding Antibody (AChR-Ab) seronegative Generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG). Other objectives are to assess long-term efficacy, safety, and tolerability of efgartigimod.

Study will consist of:

* Screening
* Part A: participants will be randomized to receive either efgartigimod IV or placebo
* Part B: participants completing part A will receive open-label efgartigimod IV
Generalized Myasthenia Gravis
BIOLOGICAL: Efgartigimod IV|OTHER: Placebo IV
Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) total score change from baseline, Minimum value: 0 (normal symptoms); Maximum value: 24 (most severe symptoms), Up to 29 days during part A
Quantitative myasthenia gravis (QMG) total score change from baseline, Minimum value: 0 (no disease severity); Maximum value: 39 (highest disease severity), Up to 29 days during part A|Proportion of participants who are both MG-ADL and QMG responders, Up to 8 weeks during part A
The primary purpose of this study is to measure the efficacy and safety of efgartigimod IV compared to placebo in participants with Acetylcholine Receptor Binding Antibody (AChR-Ab) seronegative Generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG). The study consists of a Part A where participants will be randomized to receive either efgartigimod IV or placebo IV and a Part B where participants completing part A will receive open-label efgartigimod IV. Participants will be in the study for up to (approximately) 2.5 years.
