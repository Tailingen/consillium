Selinexor (KPT-330) in Older Patients With Relapsed AML
This is a randomized, multicenter, open-label, phase 2 study of the SINE compound, selinexor given orally versus specified investigator choices (one of three potential salvage therapies). Participants age ≥ 60 years with relapsed or refractory AML of any type except for AML M3, after one prior therapy only, who have never undergone and who are not currently eligible for stem cell transplantation and are currently deemed unfit for intensive chemotherapy.

Overall Survival, Overall survival was defined as the time (in days) from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause. Participants last known to be alive were censored at date of last contact., Baseline until disease progression or discontinuation from the study, or death, whichever occurred first (up to a maximum of approximately 104 weeks)
Percentage of Participants With Overall Survival of at Least 3 Months (OS3.0), Overall survival was defined as the time (in days) from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause. Participants last known to be alive were censored at date of last contact. Analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier method., From randomization (Day 1) up to 3 months|Percentage of Participants With Complete Remission Rate (CRR) for Those Who Achieved Complete Remission (CR), CRR was analyzed using International Working Group (IWG) 2003 criteria, as the difference in the proportions of participants with IWG results of CR. CR per IWG 2003 criteria was defined as morphologic presence of \< 5 percentage (%) myeloblasts in bone marrow, the absence of circulating blasts, hematologic recovery (as evidenced by a peripheral blood absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \> 1000 cells/microliter (microL) and platelet count \> 100,000/microL, with no need for red blood cell (RBC) transfusions), and the absence of extramedullary disease., Baseline until disease progression or discontinuation from the study, or death, whichever occurred first (up to a maximum of approximately 104 weeks)|Median Disease-Free Survival (DFS) for Participants Who Achieved Complete Remission (CR), DFS for CRR based on IWG criteria, was calculated from the first date of response of CR to the date of progression or recurrence, or date of death if progression or recurrence did not occur.

FACT-Leu combines the General version of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT-G) with a leukemia-specific sub-scale (17 items). The sub-scales for the FACT-G are Physical Well-Being (7 items), Social/Family Well-Being (7 items), Emotional Well-Being (6 items), and Functional Well-Being (7 items). The trial outcomes index (TOI; total of 31 items) was the primary measurement of interest, comprising the Physical and Functional sub-scales plus the leukemia - specific sub-scale. Each item was rated on a 5-point Likert scale. Range from 0 = (Not at all) to 4 = (Very much); therefore, the TOI had a score ranging from 0 to 124. Higher scores indicated improvement in well being. The QoL assessment was performed at baseline (prior to first dose of study treatment), Day 1 of each cycle on or after the second, and at the final visit., Baseline, Day 1 of each treatment cycle (a maximum of 20 cycles: 28 days per cycle) up to 30 days after last dose of study drug (final visit)|Change From Baseline in European Quality of Life-5 Dimension (EQ-5D) Health Questionnaire Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), EQ-5D descriptive system comprises of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: 1=no problems, 2=slight problems, 3=moderate problems, 4=severe problems, and 5=extreme problems. EQ-5D-5L is a standardized instrument that measures health-related quality of life for men with prostate cancer. EQ-5D consists of EQ-5D descriptive system and EQ VAS. EQ-5D-5-VAS records participant's self-rated health on a vertical VAS that allows them to indicate their health state that can range from 0 (worst imaginable) to 100 (best imaginable), higher scores indicating a better health state., Baseline, Day 1 of each treatment cycle (a maximum of 20 cycles: 28 days per cycle) up to 30 days after last dose of study drug (final visit)
This is a randomized, multicenter, open-label phase 2 study of the SINE compound, selinexor given orally versus restricted investigator choice (i.e., one of three potential salvage therapies).

Participants who have never been transplant eligible, are currently deemed unfit for intensive chemotherapy, ≥ 60 years old, who have AML (except Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia: APL, AML M3) after one prior treatment of either hypomethylating agent or a regimen including Ara-C, and are meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized to receive either oral selinexor or physician's choice (one of three potential treatments: best supportive care (BSC) alone, or BSC + hypomethylating agent, or BSC + low dose Ara-C until disease progression, death or intolerance has occurred.
