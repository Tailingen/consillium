Pembrolizumab With Chemotherapy in Metastatic or Unresectable High Grade Gastroenteropancreatic or Lung Neuroendocrine Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the combination of chemotherapy treatment, which could be either Cisplatin or carboplatin and etoposide, and the research study drug, Pembrolizumab (also known as MK-3475) in patients with high grade neuroendocrine carcinomas of the gastroenteropancreatic system or lung who are chemotherapy na√Øve. The chemotherapy treatment you receive will be either Cisplatin or carboplatin and etoposide. the participant's doctor will discuss this choice with you and determined which chemotherapy treatment is best for you.

Combination chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for patients with high grade GEPNETs and neuroendocrine carcinomas of the lung.

This study will utilize pembrolizumab, a potent humanized immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody (mAb) with high specificity of binding to the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) receptor, thus blocks a protective mechanism of cancer cells and thereby allows the immune system to destroy them, in combination with chemotherapy.

Combination chemotherapy and pembrolizumab was recently FDA approved and ongoing trials are utilizing this or similar combination with preliminary data demonstrating a promising safety profile.
