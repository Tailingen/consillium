Natural Killer (NK) Cells in Combination with Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and Transforming Growth Factor Beta (TGFbeta) Receptor I Inhibitor Vactosertib in Cancer
One of the ways that cancer grows and spreads is by avoiding the immune system.NK cells are immune cells that kill cancer cells, but are often malfunctioning in people with colorectal cancer and blood cancers. A safe way to give people with colorectal cancer and blood cancers fresh NK cells from a healthy donor has recently been discovered. The purpose of this study is to show that using two medicines (vactosertib and IL-2) with NK cells will be safe and will activate the donor NK cells. NK cells and vactosertib are experimental because they are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). IL-2 (Proleukin®) has been approved by the FDA for treating other cancers, but the doses used in this study are lower than the approved doses and it is not approved to treat colorectal cancer or blood cancers.

Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability]), This will be defined as the incidence of Grade ≥ 2 treatment-related adverse events, Within 28 days of NK cell infusion|Persistence of donor NK cells, This will be defined as the presence of donor NK cells in recipient blood as determined by next-generation sequencing-chimerism at a frequency of \>10%., 7 days post-treatment
Persistence of donor NK cells, This will be defined as the presence of donor NK cells in recipient blood as determined by next-generation sequencing-chimerism at a frequency of \>10%., 14 days post-treatment|Persistence of donor NK cells, This will be defined as the presence of donor NK cells in recipient blood as determined by next-generation sequencing-chimerism at a frequency of \>10%., 21 days post-treatment|Persistence of donor NK cells, This will be defined as the presence of donor NK cells in recipient blood as determined by next-generation sequencing-chimerism at a frequency of \>10%., 28 days post-treatment|Clinical Response, This will be defined as a change in size of measurable disease on CT scans (colorectal cancer) or by standard methods for hematologic malignancies (e.g. bone marrow biopsy for AML), 28 days post-treatment
The goal of our study is to demonstrate that natural killer (NK) cells from non- HLA-matched donors can be safely infused into patients with colorectal cancer, patients with gastric or esophageal cancer, and patients with relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancies in combination with IL-2 and the oral TGFβ receptor I inhibitor vactosertib to improve the persistence of donor NK cells.
