Study to Evaluate the Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Clinical Activity of RP7214 in Combination With Azacitidine in Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome, Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia and Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This is a multi-center, open-label, non-randomized, two-part Phase I/Ib study of RP7214 in combination with azacitidine in patients with AML, MDS and CMML. Part I is a 3+3 dose-escalation study to identify the MTD/RP2D of RP7214 and azacitidine combination in patients with AML, MDS, and CMML. Part II is a dose-expansion study to evaluate the clinical activity and safety of RP7214 and azacitidine combination in AML.
