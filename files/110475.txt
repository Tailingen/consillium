A Study HB-201 in Patients With Newly Diagnosed HPV16+ Oropharynx or Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer
This Window of Opportunity clinical trial will examine the immunologic effects of the study agent HB-201 in the head and neck or cervical cancer, when administered by IV route.

The window of opportunity, Study H-200-002, will examine the effects of study agent (HB-201) on subjects during the "window" between diagnosis of their cancer and their definitive cancer surgery or chemoradiation.

The study will be a 2-arm study design. In Arm 1, the study will enroll subjects with resectable stage I-III human papillomavirus 16 positive (HPV 16+) genotype squamous cell cancer of the oropharynx or unknown primary cancer site who are candidates for transoral surgery. Participants will receive a single intravenous dose of the study agent HB-201 prior to transoral surgery administered intravenously.

In Arm 2, the study will enroll cervical cancer subjects who have histologically confirmed newly diagnosed advanced squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and/ or adenosquamous cell carcinoma with HPV 16+ genotype clincal stages IB to IVB with plan for initial treatment of definitive chemoradiation. Participants will receive a single intravenous dose of HB-201 prior to the start of chemoradiation.
