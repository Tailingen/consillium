A Multicentre, Parallel Arm, Open-label Trial of Frontline R-CHOP/Pola-RCHP and Glofitamab in Younger, Higher Risk Patients With Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)
This is an open label, multi-centre, phase Ib/II, parallel arm study evaluating the safety and tolerability of glofitamab in addition to backbone chemotherapy consisting of R-CHOP or polatuzumab vedotin-RCHP for younger patients with higher-risk Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma or High Grade B-Cell Lymphoma.
Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma|High-grade B-cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Doxorubicin|DRUG: Vincristine|DRUG: Prednisolone|DRUG: Glofitamab|DRUG: Polatuzumab vedotin
To assess safety of the combination of glofitamab and R-CHOP or pola-RCHP according to number of participants with treatment-related adverse events, From start of treatment till the end of study, assessed up to approximately 60 months|To evaluate the Relative Dose Intensity (RDI) of the chemotherapy backbone, From start of study treatment till the end of study treatment, assessed up to approximately 12 months|To evaluate the rates of early chemotherapy discontinuation, From start of study treatment till the end of study treatment, assessed up to approximately 12 months
To estimate the proportion of patients achieving a complete response (CR) after cycles 2, 4 and at end of induction treatment (6 cycles) of the novel combination therapy according to Lugano 2014 criteria, Up to approximately 6 months (each cycle is 21 days)|To estimate overall response rate (ORR), Up to approximately 6 months (each cycle is 21 days)|To describe progression free survival (PFS), From first dose of chemotherapy induction to first date of objectively documented progressive disease or date of death of any cause, whichever occurs first, assessed up to approximately 60 months|To describe the duration of response (DoR) measured in the subset of patients who achieved CR or PR, Time from the first documented disease response to the date of progressive disease or death, whichever occurs first, assessed up to approximately 60 months|Overall survival (OS) as defined as the time from first dose of chemotherapy induction to the date of death from any cause, From first dose of chemotherapy induction to the date of death from any cause, assessed up to approximately 60 months
Correlation between circulating tumour DNA detection and response (CR and ORR), From start of treatment till end of study assessed up to 60 months|Comparison of efficacy (rates of CR, ORR, DOR, PFS and OS) between the two study arms, From start of treatment till end of study assessed up to 60 months
This is an open label, multi-centre, phase Ib/II, parallel arm study evaluating the safety and tolerability of glofitamab in addition to backbone chemotherapy consisting of R-CHOP or polatuzumab vedotin-RCHP for younger patients with higher-risk Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma or High Grade B-Cell Lymphoma.
