PD0332991 (Palbociclib) in Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Liposarcoma
The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad, Palbociclib (Ibrance) (formerly known as PD0332991) has on the patient and on the liposarcoma.

Palbociclib is an investigational drug. An investigational drug is a medication that has not been approved for marketing by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Palbociclib blocks a protein called CDK4 which is part of a pathway in liposarcoma cells that is over-active. The investigators hope that blocking CDK4 will shut down this pathway in the liposarcoma cells and stop tumors from growing. Palbociclib is an oral medication.
