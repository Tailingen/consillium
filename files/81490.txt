Pyrazoloacridine in Treating Patients With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy with pyrazoloacridine in treating patients with stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.
Lung Cancer
DRUG: pyrazoloacridine
Evaluate toxicity of pyrazoloacridine., Weekly prior to each treatment cycle.
Evaluate the response frequency of pyrazoloacridine., After 2 treatment cycles then every 2 months
OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the antitumor activity of pyrazoloacridine (PZA) administered by 3-hour infusion to patients with advanced non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). II. Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicities of PZA administered on this schedule. III. Determine the response and survival durations of NSCLC patients treated with PZA.

OUTLINE: Single-Agent Chemotherapy. Pyrazoloacridine, PZA, NSC-366140.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: If 2 or 3 responses are observed in the first 18 evaluable patients, 12 additional patients will be entered. Accrual is expected to take 5-12 months.
