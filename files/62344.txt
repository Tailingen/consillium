Sunitinib in Treating Patients With Kidney Cancer That Has Spread to the Brain
RATIONALE: Sunitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well sunitinib works in treating patients with kidney cancer that has spread to the brain.
Kidney Cancer|Metastatic Cancer
DRUG: sunitinib malate
Objective response rate in the brain after 2 courses, From beginning of treatment until 2 courses of treatment
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine the objective response rate in the brain after 2 courses of sunitnib malate in patients with previously untreated or recurrent brain metastases secondary to renal cancer following radiotherapy or surgery.

Secondary

* Evaluate duration of response.
* Evaluate objective response of non-CNS targets.
* Evaluate time to disease progression.
* Evaluate overall and progression-free survival.
* Evaluate neurological symptoms associated with the tumor.
* Evaluate feasibility and overall tolerance of this drug.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily for 4 weeks. Courses repeat every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months.
