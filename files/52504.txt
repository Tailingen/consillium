Imatinib Mesylate in Treating Patients With Recurrent Meningioma
Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of imatinib mesylate in treating patients who have recurrent meningioma. Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for tumor cell growth

DRUG: imatinib mesylate|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis|OTHER: pharmacological study
6 Months - Progression-free Survival According to Response Evaluation Using Macdonald Criteria, The Macdonald criteria, roughly similarly to other systems, divides response into 4 types of response based on imaging (magnetic resonance imaging \[MRI\]) and clinical features

1: complete response; 2: partial response; 3:stable disease; 4:progression

Complete response imaging features: disappearance of all enhancing disease (measurable and non-measurable) sustained for at least 4 weeks; no new lesions clinical features; no corticosteroids; clinically stable or improved

Partial response imaging features: 50% or more decrease of all measurable enhancing lesions sustained for at least 4 weeks: no new lesions clinical features: stable or reduced corticosteroids; clinically stable or improved

Stable disease imaging features: does not qualify for complete response, partial response or progression clinical features: clinically stable

Progression imaging features: 25% of more increase in enhancing lesions; any new lesions clinical features: clinical deterioration, At 6 months

Complete Response (CR): Complete disappearance of all measurable/evaluable disease. No new lesions. No evidence of non-evaluable disease. Patients on minimal/no steroids.

Partial Response (PR): \>/= to 50% decrease under baseline in the sum of products of perpendicular diameters of all measurable lesions. No progression of evaluable disease. Responders must be on same/decreasing doses of dexamethasone.

Stable/No Response: Does not qualify for CR, PR, or progression. Progression: 25% increase in the sum of products of all measurable lesions over smallest sum observed (over Baseline (BL) if no decrease), OR clear worsening of any evaluable disease, OR appearance of any new lesion/site, OR failure to return for evaluation due to death or deteriorating condition (unless clearly unrelated to this cancer)., 3 years
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. Determine the efficacy of imatinib mesylate, in terms of 6-month progression-free survival, of patients with recurrent meningioma.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES I. Determine the response rate and overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

II. Evaluate the safety profile of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. IV. Develop exploratory data concerning surrogate markers of of angiogenic activity in vivo using functional neuro-imaging studies and in vitro assays of serum angiogenic peptides of this drug in these patients.

V. Develop exploratory data concerning evidence of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) inhibition in tumor specimens taken from patients undergoing surgery VI. Develop exploratory data correlating molecular abnormalities in the tumor with response in patients treated with this drug.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to concurrent use of enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (yes vs no), histology (benign vs atypical or malignant), neurofibromatosis positivity (yes vs no), and preoperative candidacy (yes vs no).

Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once or twice daily. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients are followed every 3 months.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients (30 per stratum) will be accrued for this study within 8-12 months.
