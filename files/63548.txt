Apatinib Plus Camrelizumab in Patients With Previously Treated Advanced Biliary Tract Cancer
The investigators design a prospective clinical study to explore the efficacy and safety of apatinib plus camrelizumab in pretreated patients with advanced biliary tract malignant tumors and to analyze potential biomarkers of therapeutic response.
Biliary Tract Cancer|Cholangiocarcinoma|Biomarker|Hepatobiliary Neoplasm
DRUG: Apatinib plus Camrelizumab
Progression-free Survival (PFS), A duration from the date of initial treatment with apatinib plus camrelizumab to disease progression (defined by RECIST 1.1) or death of any cause., Six months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Proportion of patients whose tumor volume has reached a predetermined value and can maintain a minimum time limit, including complete response and partial response patients., One year
Overall Survival (OS), Duration from the date of initial treatment with apatinib plus camrelizumab to the date of death due to any cause, Two years|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Event, Any adverse events related with treatment with apatinib plus camrelizumab, Two years
Clinical benefit rate (CBR), The CBR was defined as the proportion of patients who achieved a radiologically confirmed objective response (CR or PR) or who had PFS time longer than 6 months., Six months
This was a non-randomized, single institutional, open-label, prospective trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of apatinib in combination with camrelizumab for patients with biliary tract malignant tumors.

It is estimated that 20 patients who met the study criteria will be enrolled in PUMCH and treated with aptinib and camrelizumab. The investigators will follow up and collect subjects' data each month to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment, including treatment related adverse events, overall survival and time to progression and objective response. Multi-omics data analysis will be used to find potential biomarkers of treatment response.
