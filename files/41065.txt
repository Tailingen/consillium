A Phase Ib Study Evaluating the Safety and Tolerability of Vitamin C in Patients With Intermediate or High Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome With TET2 Mutations
This is an open label, Phase Ib study designed to evaluate the safety, toxicity and biological activity of high dose Vitamin C in bone marrow and peripheral blood when administered as therapy to patients with intermediate or high risk myelodysplastic syndrome according to the revised IPSS (international prognostic scoring system) criteria whose disease has a Ten-eleven translocation-2, (TET2) mutation. The primary objectives phase 1 study is to establish safety and confirm a steady level of Vitamin C on ≥1 mM in \> 75% of the patients is achieved. All patients will receive at least 1 cycle of treatment (4 weeks). Patients with clinical benefit (CR,PR, or SD) then will undergo a second 4-week cycle of treatment.
