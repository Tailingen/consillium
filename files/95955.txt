Rucaparib and Irinotecan in Cancers With Mutations in DNA Repair
This is an open label, non-randomized, dose escalation and expansion Phase Ib trial to evaluate the safety and recommended phase II dose of the combination of irinotecan and rucaparib.
Solid Tumor, Unspecified, Adult
DRUG: Rucaparib|DRUG: Irinotecan
Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with either confirmed complete or partial response (as per RECIST version 1.1) as best overall response over the total population., Up to 24 months.
Median Response duration, Response duration is defined as the time from initial response to the first documented tumor progression., Up to 24 months
In dose escalation, patients will receive irinotecan and rucaparib. Irinotecan will be given once every 2 weeks (or 3 weeks if not tolerated) and rucaparib will be given twice daily for 7-14 days. Each cycle will be 28 days in duration unless we need to switch to the intermediate dosing regimen of every 21 days. Both rucaparib and irinotecan will be escalated.

In dose expansion, patients who have received prior PARP inhibitors will go straight to the combination arm of irinotecan and rucaparib. If patients are PARP inhibitor na√Øve, they can receive single agent rucaparib until progression. Once patients on single agent rucaparib progress, they can choose to go on the combination treatment arm. Patients will continue on treatment until disease progression or intolerable toxicity.
