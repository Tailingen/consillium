Time-limited Triplet Combination of Pirtobrutinib, Venetoclax, and Obinutuzumab for Patients With Treatment-na√Øve Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) or Richter Transformation (RT)
To learn if the combination of pirtobrutinib (also called LOXO-305), venetoclax, and obinutuzumab is safe and effective when given to patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or Richter transformation (RT) who have not previously received treatment.
Leukemia
DRUG: Pirtobrutinib|DRUG: Obinutuzumab|DRUG: Venetoclax|DRUG: Valacyclovir|DRUG: Allopurinol
The severity of the adverse events (AEs) will be graded according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 5.0., through study completion an average of 1 year.
Primary Objective:

1. Estimate the therapeutic activity (undetectable measurable residual disease \[U-MRD\] rate) of combined pirtobrutinib, venetoclax, and obinutuzumab in patients with previously untreated CLL/SLL (cohort 1) by undetectable measurable residual disease (U-MRD) rate and Richter transformation (cohort 2) by overall response rate (ORR) (defined as CMR//PMR).

Secondary Objectives:

1. To estimate the therapeutic activity of combination therapy by determining:

   1. Combined response rate (defined as CR/CRi/PR) as assessed by the investigator for cohort 1 (CLL/SLL)
   2. Progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).
   3. U-MRD response with next generation sequencing assay for cohort 2
2. To determine the safety and tolerability of this combination therapy

Exploratory Objective:

1. To study immunological and molecular changes in the peripheral blood and bone marrow in response to pirtobrutinib, venetoclax, and obinutuzumab.
2. To evaluate the kinetics of MRD response over time
