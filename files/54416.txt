To evaluate the molecular testing pattern in metastatic NSCLC patients after QIP, Molecular testing-rate for the first-line treatment: Defined as the number of participants received molecular testing for the first-line treatment divided by total participants., Follow up approximately 24 months after last patient in|To evaluate the treatment pattern in metastatic NSCLC patients after QIP, TKIs first-line treatment rate: Defined as TKIs first-line treatment rate in AGA positive participants., Follow up approximately 24 months after last patient in
To evaluate the clinical outcomes in metastatic NSCLC patients after QIP, Progression Free Survival (PFS): Defined as the time from beginning of first-line treatment to disease progression or death for any cause, whichever occurs first., Follow up approximately 24 months after last patient in|To evaluate the treatment pattern in metastatic NSCLC patients after QIP, 1st/2nd/3rd generation EGFR-TKIs first-line treatment rate: Defined 1st/2nd/3rd generation EGFR-TKIs first-line treatment rate in EGFR positive participants., Follow up approximately 24 months after last patient in|To evaluate the treatment pattern in metastatic NSCLC patients after QIP, Immunotherapy first-line treatment rate: Defined as PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors first-line treatment rate in AGA negative participants., Follow up approximately 24 months after last patient in|To evaluate the clinical outcomes in metastatic NSCLC patients after QIP, Response rate: Defined as the percentage of participants with the disease first-line treatment response by investigator assessment as recorded in CRF., Follow up approximately 24 months after last patient in|To evaluate the clinical outcomes in metastatic NSCLC patients after QIP, Disease control rate: Defined as the percentage of participants with the disease first-line treatment control by investigator assessment as recorded in CRF, Follow up approximately 24 months after last patient in|To evaluate the clinical outcomes in metastatic NSCLC patients after QIP, Duration of Response: Defined as the time from first-line treatment response to disease progression or death in participants who achieve responding by investigator assessment as recorded in CRF., Follow up approximately 24 months after last patient in
To evaluate the molecular testing pattern of physicians, Molecular testing concept for the first-line treatment of survey: Defined as the number of physicians recognized molecular testing for the first-line treatment divided by total physicians., Follow up approximately 24 months after last patient in|To evaluate the treatment pattern of physicians, TKIs first-line treatment concept of survey: Defined as the number of physicians recognized TKIs first-line treatment in AGA positive participants divided by total physicians., Follow up approximately 24 months after last patient in
The primary objective of this study is to assess the implementation of standardized diagnosis and treatment practice in oncology departments of Small/Middle tier cities and County hospitals, after standardized education and implementation of lung cancer clinical practice guidelines for oncology physicians.
