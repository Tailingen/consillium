Nanocrystalline Megestrol Acetate for the Treatment of Anorexia-Cachexia Syndrome in Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Prospective, Open-Label, Single-Arm Phase II Clinical Study
Patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer are a high-risk group for cancer cachexia and anorexia. Meanwhile, the adverse reactions of chemotherapy and immunotherapy potentially exacerbate the occurrence and development of cancer cachexia and anorexia. Cancer cachexia and anorexia also severely affect the quality of life of patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer, significantly shortening their overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), thus forming a vicious cycle.

Numerous previous studies have shown that for patients with advanced tumors, the combination of supportive treatments such as megestrol acetate during chemotherapy or concurrent chemoradiotherapy is a treatment mode with clinical significance and practical feasibility in clinical practice. However, the efficacy and the optimal treatment timing of its combination with the current first-line immunochemotherapy regimen remain unclear. Although mechanistic studies have shown that anti-cachexia treatment may synergistically enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy, there is a lack of relevant clinical research evidence.
