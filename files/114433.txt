Real-World Mapping Antithrombotic Regimens in MM Patients on Treatment
The goal of this observational study is to learn about antithrombotic regimens in Multiple myeloma patients. The main question it aims to answer is the efficacy of different types of thromboprophylaxis (antiplatelet agents, heparins, oral anticoagulants) in preventing venous thromboembolism (VTE).
Multiple Myeloma|Diagnosis
Rate of venous thromboembolism according to different thromboprophylaxis strategies, Efficacy of different thromboprophylaxis strategies vs no thromboprophylaxis in terms of rate of VTE in patients newly diagnosed:

1. Comparison of VTE rate in patients treated with antiplatelet agents vs no thromboprophylaxis
2. Comparison of VTE rate in patients treated with heparins vs no thromboprophylaxis
3. Comparison of VTE rate in patients treated with oral anticoagulants vs no thromboprophylaxis., 3 years
This is an observational prospective cohort study aimed at assessing the efficacy of different types of thromboprophylaxis in MM patients; the setting is the GIMEMA network of the Italian haematological Centers.

The observation time for each patient will be of 3 years from the start of the active treatment for MM. Patients will remain in the study regardless of the stage of disease, type of treatment (induction, transplantation, maintenance), type of antithrombotic prophylaxis, occurrence of thrombosis.

Four cohorts will be identified: cohort 1 will include patients without thromboprophylaxis, cohort 2 will include patients receiving antiplatelet agents, cohort 3 will include patients receiving heparins, and cohort 4 will include patients receiving oral anticoagulants.
