Studying Lymph Nodes in Patients With Stage II Colon Cancer
RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures that look for micrometastases in lymph nodes removed during surgery for colon cancer may help doctors learn the extent of disease.

PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying lymph nodes in patients with stage II colon cancer.
Colorectal Cancer
GENETIC: RNA marker analysis of lymph node and primary tumors|GENETIC: microarray profiling of primary tumors|GENETIC: reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction of lymph node specimens|OTHER: diagnostic laboratory RNA and DNA biomarker analysis of primary tumors|PROCEDURE: regional lymph node dissection|OTHER: lymph node staining for H&E and pancytokeratin IHC
Disease-free survival (time to local or distant recurrence after resection), The event to be used for DFS is time to recurrence (local or distant) after resection of colon cancer, 48 months
Overall survival (time to death from colorectal cancer), The event to be used for DFS is time to death after resection of colon cancer, 48 months
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine whether the immunohistochemical and molecular presence of micrometastases in â‰¥ 12 lymph nodes removed during en-bloc resection in patients with stage II colon cancer correlates with 3-year disease-free survival.
* Evaluate the prognostic significance of molecular markers detected in the primary tumor and develop a microarray-based gene signature for stage II colon cancer.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Tumor tissue and regional lymph node samples are collected during surgery for analysis of micrometastases and molecular markers by immunohistochemistry, qRT-PCR, MM qRT-PCR, qRDNA-PCR, and microarray profiling.

Patients are followed up periodically for 4 years after surgery.
