Collecting Blood and Stool Samples to Detect Colorectal Cancer or Advanced Neoplasia in Lynch Syndrome Patients, CORAL Study
This study collects blood and stool samples from patients with suspected or diagnosed Lynch syndrome to evaluate a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) screening technique for the detection of colorectal cancer in Lynch syndrome patients.
Colorectal Carcinoma|Lynch Syndrome
PROCEDURE: Biospecimen Collection|OTHER: Electronic Health Record Review
Sensitivity of multitarget stool deoxyribonucleic acid (mt-sDNA) 2.0 test to detect colorectal neoplasia, Results of the mt-sDNA 2.0 test will be correlated with pathology findings of patients undergoing colonoscopy to determine sensitivity of the mt-sDNA 2.0 test, Up to 4 years|Specificity of mt-sDNA 2.0 test to detect colorectal dysplasia, Results of the mt-sDNA 2.0 test will be correlated with pathology findings of patients undergoing colonoscopy to determine specificity of the mt-sDNA 2.0 test, Up to 4 years
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To determine the sensitivity and specificity of the multitarget stool DNA (mt-sDNA) 2.0 test, for colorectal neoplasia in patients with Lynch syndrome.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

I. Develop a biorepository of samples (stool and blood) from patients with Lynch syndrome and early onset (\< 50 years old) colorectal cancer.

OUTLINE:

Patients undergo collection of blood and stool samples no more than 90 days prior to or between 7-90 days after standard of care colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy. Patients' medical records are also reviewed.
