Captopril Use on the Degree of Marrow Fibrosis in Bone Marrow Fibrosis/Myeloproliferative Neoplasms
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of captopril and evaluate the effectiveness captopril as measured by changes in the grade of bone marrow scar tissue. The change in spleen size by ultrasound will also be measured.
Bone Marrow Fibrosis|Myeloproliferative Neoplasm
DRUG: Captopril
Change in degree of bone marrow fibrosis by World Health Organization WHO grade, Change in degree of bone marrow fibrosis by WHO grade. "Change" is defined as reduction by one grade (e.g. MF-3 to MF-2 or MF-2 to MF-1), At 6 months
Change in spleen size by ultrasound, Change in spleen size in centimeters measured using abdominal ultrasound by an experienced radiologist. Spleen length will be asses for response, At 3 months|Change in spleen size by ultrasound, Change in spleen size in centimeters measured using abdominal ultrasound by an experienced radiologist. Spleen length will be asses for response, At 6 months|Change in symptom burden assessed using Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form total symptom scores (MPN-SAF TSS), Change in symptom burden assessed using MPN-SAF TSS The MPN-SAF TSS is assessed by the patients themselves and this includes fatigue, concentration, early satiety, inactivity, night sweats, itching, bone pain, abdominal discomfort, weight loss, and fevers. Scoring is from 0 (absent/as good as it can be) to 10 (worst imaginable/as bad as it can be) for each item. The MPN-SAF TSS is the summation of all the individual scores (0-100 scale). Symptoms response requires ≥50% reduction in the MPN-SAF TSS., At 3 months|Change in symptom burden assessed using MPN-SAF TSS, Change in symptom burden assessed using Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form total symptom scores (MPN-SAF TSS).

Symptoms response requires ≥50% reduction in the MPN-SAF TSS., At 6 months|Response rate per International Working Group-Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research and Treatment 2 (IWG-MRT) Criteria as measured by percent of participants with CR, PR, or CI, Includes Complete response (CR), partial remission (PR) or Clinical improvement (CI)

Captopril is an investigational (experimental) drug that works by inhibiting the production of angiotensin II by blocking angiotensin converting enzyme. Reducing angiotensin II may reduce the bone marrow scar tissue in myelofibrosis. It is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for this indication. Participants in this study will be asked to have 2 bone marrow biopsies, a total of 3 blood samples, and fill out questionnaires asking about how you feel.
