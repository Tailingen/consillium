Efficacy of Adjuvant Cytokine-induced Killer Cells in Colon Cancer
It has been reported that the immune status of patients with cancer were suppressed, especially those after surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. Thus, immunotherapy may decrease the recurrence rate after surgery. CIK cells transfusion has been reported as an effect therapy in advanced cancers. In another retrospective study, investigators found that adjuvant CIK therapy would prolong the disease-free survival (DFS) for colorectal cancer patients.

The purpose of this study is to determine wether adjuvant immunotherapy with CIK cells in patients with colon cancer after operation will prolong DFS, and overall survival (OS).
Colonic Neoplasms
BIOLOGICAL: cytokine-induced killer cells
DFS (Disease free survival), Patients who were recurrence free at the end of study or lost to follow-up were censored, Time elapsedelapsed from the date of surgery to either the date of recurrence or the date of last follow-up information,whichever come first, assessed up to 5 years.
OS (overall survival), Patients who were survival at the end of study or lost to follow-up were censored, Time elapsed from the date of surgery to either the date of death or the date of last follow-up information, whichever came first, assessed up to 5 years.|Side effect, Any undesirable secondary effect which occurs in addition to the desired therapeutic effect of CIK or chemotherapy, during the period from the first cycle of chemotherapy or CIK infusion to the end of study. The side effects were described according to the NCI-CTCAE (National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events), Up to 2 years|T lymphocyte subset, During the period of CIK infusion, Up to 6 months|QoL (quality of life), During the period of chemotherapy and CIK infusion, Up to 1 year
