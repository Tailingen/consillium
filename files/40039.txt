Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Effectiveness of TQB2618 Injection Combined Therapy in Patients With Advanced Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
To investigate the efficacy and safety of TQB2618 injection combined Penpulimab and chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of recurrent/metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma compared with Penpulimab combined chemotherapy.

The primary efficacy outcomes are progression free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR).
Advanced Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: TQB2618 injection, Penpulimab injection, Paclitaxel, Cisplatin|DRUG: Penpulimab injection, Paclitaxel, Cisplatin|DRUG: TQB2618 injection, Penpulimab injection, TQB3617capsules
PFS, The time from the first administration of the drug to disease progression or death (whichever occurs first)., Baseline up to two years.|ORR, According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 and iRECIST, the proportion of subjects whose tumors are evaluated as complete response(CR) and partial response(PR) by subcenter imaging evaluation. It is recorded from the first use of the drug to disease progression or initiation of a new anticancer treatment., Baseline up to two years.
Overall survival (OS), From randomization to the time of death from any cause., Baseline up to death event, assessed up to 2 years.|Disease Control Rate (DCR), The percentage of participants with complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) at 6 weeks or greater than or equal to as determined by investigators according to Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) 1.1., Baseline to up to two years.|Duration of Remission (DOR), The period from firstly-recorded objective tumor response (CR or PR) to firstly-recorded objective tumor progression or death due to any cause (whichever occurs first)., Baseline to up to two years.|Incidence of adverse events (AEs), All adverse medical events that occur after the subject receives the investigational drug may be manifested as symptoms, signs, disease, or laboratory abnormalities, but are not necessarily causally related to the investigational drug. The adverse events were evaluated according to the National Cancer Institute standard for common toxic reactions (NCI-CTC v5.0)., Baseline to up to two years.|Severity of adverse events (AEs), All adverse medical events that occur after the subject receives the investigational drug may be manifested as symptoms, signs, disease, or laboratory abnormalities, but are not necessarily causally related to the investigational drug. The severity of adverse events were evaluated according to the National Cancer Institute standard for common toxic reactions (NCI CTC) V5.0., Baseline to up to two years.|Incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs), It refers to adverse medical events such as death, life-threatening, permanent or serious disability or loss of function, hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization, and congenital abnormalities or birth defects after the subject receives the experimental drug., Baseline to up to two years.
