Study of Combination of Ipilimumab and Nivolumab in Patients With Melanoma
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of treatment with Nivolumab in combination with Ipilimumab in subjects with resected Stages IIIB/IIIC/ IV melanoma.
Melanoma
BIOLOGICAL: Nivolumab|BIOLOGICAL: Ipilimumab
Relapse-Free Survival, Number of participants who are relapse-free at 48 months after initiating treatment in the study., Month 48 Post-Treatment Initiation
Number of Cases of Adverse Events Occurring During Study, The adverse events are evaluated per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) V4., Month 12 Post-Treatment Initiation|Overall Survival, Percentage of participants who are alive at at 48 months after initiating treatment in the study., Month 48 Post-Treatment Initiation
The investigators hypothesize that PD-1 blockade combined with CTLA-4 blockade using ipilimumab would have a favorable effect on the expansion and activity of human CD8+ T cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs) specific for tumor-associated antigens (ie, self antigens), which would translate into improved anti-cancer therapy.
