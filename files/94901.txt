SHR- 1210 Combined With Paclitaxel (Albumin Bound) and Gemcitabine as First-line Therapy in Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
This is an open-label, single center, non-randomized, phase I trial to evaluate safety and efficacy of using the combination treatment of SHR-1210 with Paclitaxel-albumin and gemcitabine of metastatic PDAC.

PD-1 antibody SHR-1210 is a humanized monoclonal antibody, and the heavy chain is immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4), the light chain is immunoglobulin κ (IgK). SHR-1210 specifically binds to PD-1 and blocks the interaction of PD-1 with its ligand (PD-L1), allowing T cells to recover against tumor immune responses.

The safety of SHR-1210 will be assessed by ongoing reviews of clinical laboratory tests, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), and adverse events. Evaluations of immune safety will also be conducted (immune-related adverse events (AEs), or labs of autoimmune sera, inflammatory events, and immunogenicity). Safety evaluations (both clinical and laboratory) are performed at baseline, before each study treatment, and throughout the study.

Tumor response will be assessed by radiographic examination in screening visit and every 2 cycles after first dose.
