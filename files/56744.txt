A Study to Evaluate the Safety,PK and PD of APG-2575 in Patients With Hematologic Malignancies
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of APG-2575 in patients with relapse or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non-hodgkin's lymphoma.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Non Hodgkin Lymphoma
DRUG: APG-2575
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), Patients with APG-2575 treatment related adverse events (AE), serious adverse events (SAE) will be assessed according NCI CTCAE Version 5.0, 28 days
Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) will be assessed in the patients treated with APG-2575, 28 days|Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) of APG-2575 will be assessed in the patients treated with APG-2575, 28 days|Anti-tumor effects of APG-2575, Response will be evaluated every 2 cycles (8 weeks), by the investigator based on disease specific criteria., up to 3 years
This is a multi-center, single-agent, open-label, Phase I study of APG-2575. The study consists of the dose escalation stage and the dose expansion stage. APG-2575 will be administered orally, once daily for consecutive 4 weeks as one cycle. Initially, the start dose is 20mg. Single patient cohorts will be evaluated, the dose of APG-2575 will be increased in subsequent cohorts, to 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 400 mg, 600mg and 800mg accordingly. If there is any one of the following event is observed, a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), two drug related Grade 2 toxicities or one drug related ≥ Grade 3 toxicity, or laboratory or clinical tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), or suspected hypersensitivity reaction occur in Cycle 1, the dose escalation will convert to the standard 3+3 design, If ≥ 2/6 patients develop DLT at any dose level dose escalation will cease and the dose level immediately below will be expanded to 6 patients. If ≤ 1/6 patients develop a DLT at the highest dose reached this will be declared the MTD. After the MTD/Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) is defined, a maximum of 40 patients will be treated at that dose level.
