A Clinical Study of V940 and Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in People With Melanoma (V940-012/INTerpath-012)
Researchers want to learn if V940 with pembrolizumab can stop advanced melanoma from growing or spreading. Melanoma is a type of skin cancer. Advanced means the cancer has spread to other parts of the body and cannot be removed with surgery. A standard (or usual) treatment for advanced melanoma is immunotherapy. Immunotherapy is a treatment that helps the immune system fight cancer. V940 is a study treatment designed to help a person's immune system attack their specific cancer. Pembrolizumab is an immunotherapy.

The goal of this study is to learn if people who receive V940 with pembrolizumab live longer without the cancer growing or spreading than people who receive placebo with pembrolizumab. A placebo looks like the study treatment but has no study treatment in it. Using a placebo helps researchers better understand the effects of a study treatment.
Malignant Melanoma
BIOLOGICAL: V940|BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab|OTHER: Placebo
Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression per Response Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) by investigator assessment or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Progressive disease (PD) is defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD. PFS per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by investigator will be presented., Up to approximately 36 months
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with Complete Response (CR: disappearance of all target lesions) or Partial Response (PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1. The percentage of participants who experience CR or PR per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by investigator will be presented., Up to approximately 6 years|Duration of Response (DOR), For participants who demonstrate a confirmed CR (disappearance of all target lesions) or PR (at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1, DOR is defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until PD or death. Per RECIST 1.1, PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD. DOR as assessed by investigator will be presented., Up to approximately 6 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as time from randomization to death due to any cause., Up to approximately 6 years|Number of Participants With ≥1 Adverse Event (AE), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study intervention. The number of participants who experience one or more AEs will be reported., Up to approximately 27 months|Number of Participants Discontinuing From Study Therapy Due to AE, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study intervention. The number of participants who discontinue study intervention due to an AE will be reported., Up to approximately 24 months
