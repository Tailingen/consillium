Antigen-specific Cancer Immunotherapy (TG01) and Gemcitabine as Adjuvant Therapy in Resected Pancreatic Cancer
The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of TG01 and Granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) when given in addition to gemcitabine (chemotherapy) and

* Understand any possible side effects of the additional use of TG01/GM-CSF with gemcitabine
* Investigate whether TG01/GM-CSF when given with gemcitabine can produce an immune response
* Investigate if the treatment can delay or reduce recurrence of the disease
Pancreatic Cancer, Resected
BIOLOGICAL: TG01|BIOLOGICAL: TG01
Patients' Safety During Study, Assess the safety (number and nature of Adverse events and laboratory data occurring during study (before, during and after chemotherapy is given) in subjects treated with the Pancreatic Cancer ASCI, 2 years|Patients' Immune Response, Assess the Immune response (DTH responses and Proliferative T-cell responses) up to 2 years of treatment, During the 2 years of treatment
Clinical Efficacy, Efficacy exploring disease free survival and overall survival., DFS was followed for up to 2 years and OS until last patient included had been in the study for 3 years.
Relationship Between (KRAS) Status and Clinical Efficacy, Relationship between KRAS status and recurrence, 2 years
