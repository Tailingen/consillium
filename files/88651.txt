Incidence of adverse events (safety and tolerability) in study NG-641, Incidence of adverse events, adverse events meeting protocol-defined DLT criteria, adverse events leading to study treatment or study discontinuation, and adverse events resulting in death., End of study treatment visit
To characterise the safety and tolerability of NG-641 in patients with metastatic or advanced epithelial tumours.

The Phase 1a part of the study is a dose-escalation and dose-optimization phase investigating NG-641 administration by intravenous (IV) infusion in a range of tumour types.

The Phase 1b part of the study will investigate the selected optimized multicycle dosing regimen as a monotherapy in up to three cohorts of patients with specific tumour types (Dose Expansion Cohorts A, B and C).
