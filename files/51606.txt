A Study to Evaluate Eciskafusp Alfa in Combination With Bacillus Calmette-guerin (BCG) in Participants With BCG-unresponsive High-risk Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC)
The study aims to establish the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), relevant biomarkers, pharmacodynamics (PD) and preliminary anti-tumor activity of the intravesical administration of eciskafusp alfa in combination with BCG in participants with BCG-unresponsive high-risk NMIBC.

The study plans a similar evaluation of eciskafusp alfa in monotherapy following a positive interim analysis of the combination therapy.
