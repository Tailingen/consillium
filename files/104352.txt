Autologous Patch Healing vs. Secondary Intention Healing After Mohs Micrographic Surgery
The primary objects of this study is to explore the potential effect of the autologous patch to optimize wound healing after skin cancer surgery with Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) in the face in a randomized controlled trial comparing autologous patch healing versus secondary intention healing.
Skin Cancer|Basal Cell Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: MMS + Autologous patch|PROCEDURE: MMS and secondary intention healing
Blinded assesment of wound healing at day 18-20., Two indenpendent trained clinical doctors will evaluate clinical photos. Wounds will be evaluated fully epithelialized yes/no., Day 18-20
Blinded assesment of wound healing at day 11-13, Clinical photos from day 11-13 will be evaluated. Wounds will be evaluated 50% fully epithelialized yes/no., day 11-13|TEWL measurement, Trans epidermal water loss (TEWL) will be meassured at day 11-13 and day 18-20. The TEWL will be meassured on the wound healing site and the contralateral site of the patient's face as a control., day 11-13 and day 18-20|Scar evaluation using the patient-observer-scar-assesment-scale (POSAS) at 6 months follow-up., The POSAS observer scores scar components with regards to: Vascularity, pigmentation, thickness, surface area, relief and pliability. The collected sum of scores will range from minimum 6 points to maximum 60 points., 6 months|Difference in microbiology between intervention wounds and control wounds., Swab test for microbiome analysis will be conducted at day 1 and day 11-13., day 1 and day 11-13
