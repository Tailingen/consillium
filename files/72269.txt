Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (Siglec) are a class of classical immunoglobulin-like lectins. Studies have shown that Siglec-6 is commonly expressed in AML but not detected on normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSC/P). In vitro experiments revealed that anti-Siglec-6 CAR-T cell treatment did not affect the viability or lineage differentiation in colony-forming assays. These data suggest that anti-SigLlec-6 is an ideal target with great potential for treating acute myeloid leukemia.
