JS207 Combined With Chemotherapy in Subjects With Stage II-III NSCLC
This is a phase II clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, preliminary efficacy and pharmacokinetics of JS207 (anti-PD-1/VEGF bispecific antibody) combined with platinum-based doublet chemotherapy in subjects with stage II-III non-small cell lung cancer. The study consists of 2 cohorts, including treatment-na誰ve and resectable subjects with stage II-III NSCLC (cohort 1), treatment-na誰ve and unresectalbe subjects with stage III NSCLC (cohort 2). Subjects in both cohorts will receive 3 cycles of JS207 + platinum-based doublet chemotherapy as neoadjuvant therapy, followed by surgery or definitive chemoradiotherapy, and then adjuvant therapy with JS207 (post-surgery) or consolidation therapy with JS207 (post-chemoradiotherapy).
