CPI-613, Cytarabine, and Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of CPI-613 when given together with cytarabine and mitoxantrone hydrochloride in treating patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as CPI-613, cytarabine and mitoxantrone hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. CPI-613 may help cytarabine and mitoxantrone hydrochloride work better by making cancer cells more sensitive to the drugs

MTD of CPI-613 based on the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE 3.0), 14 days
Response rate (CR, CRi, and PR), Confidence intervals will be calculated., Day 14 of course 1|Overall survival, We will use Kaplan-Meier estimation., Up to 6 months
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CPI-613 when administered with high dose cytarabine, and mitoxantrone (mitoxantrone hydrochloride).

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the pharmacokinetics (PKs) of CPI-613 following intravenous (IV) administration in combination with high dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone.

II. To observe the response rate (complete response \[CR\], complete response with incomplete platelet recovery \[CRi\] and partial response \[PR\]) of CPI-613 in combination with high dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone.

III. To observe the overall survival of patients treated with CPI-613 in combination with high dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone.

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of CPI-613.

Patients receive CPI-613 intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 1-5, cytarabine IV over 3 hours every 12 hours for 5 doses beginning on day 3, and mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV over 15 minutes after the 1st, 3rd, and 5th doses of cytarabine. . Treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 2 courses\* in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

NOTE: \*Patients undergoing a second course of therapy receive CPI-613 IV over 2 hours on days 1-3, cytarabine IV over 3 hours every 12 hours for 5 doses beginning on day 2, and mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV over 15 minutes after the 1st and 3rd doses of cytarabine.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 6 months.
