Study to Assess the Blood Levels and Safety of Olaparib in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumours and Normal Liver Function or Mild or Moderate Liver Impairment
This is a 2-part study in patients with advanced solid tumours. Part A will investigate the PK of olaparib in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment compared to patients with normal hepatic function; Part B will allow patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment or normal hepatic function continued access to olaparib after the PK phase and will provide additional safety data.
