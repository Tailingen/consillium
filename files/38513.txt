The Effects of the Endocrine System on Endometrial Cancer
Endometrial cancer usually begins in the endometrium, which is the tissue lining of the uterus. Endometrial cancer is the most commonly diagnosed gynaecological malignancy in Australia. It affects 1 in 80 Australian women and there are about 1400 new cases and 260 deaths from the disease every year. Most affected women are aged between 50 and 70 years. The purpose of this study is to investigate the possible role of the endocrine system in the regulation of human endometrial cancer. By looking at the laboratory results of people with endometrial cancer and also those without endometrial cancer we hope to gain a better understanding of how endometrial cancer develops and progresses. This may lead to the development of new, effective therapies for endometrial cancer.
