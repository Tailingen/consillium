Low-dose Computer Tomography in Follow-up of Soft Tissue Sarcomas
The goal of this interventional study is to compare sensitivity of regular chest x-ray to ultra-low-dose computed tomography to find pulmonary relapse in follow-up of soft tissue sarcoma. The main question\[s\] it aims to answer are:

* Is ultra-low-dose computed tomography more sensitive than regular chest x-ray to find pulmonary relapse?
* Does ultra-low-dose computed tomography detect the most fast-growing pulmonary metastases earlier than regular chest x-ray?

Participants will have seven ultra-low-dose computed tomography imagings in addition to simultaneous routine protocol of chest x-rays. Participants therefore work as their own controls.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: ultra-low-dose computed tomography
Number of patients with pulmonary relapse detected by ultra-low-dose CT performed according to a pre-defined schedule, 2 years|Number of patients with pulmonary relapse detected by chest x-ray performed according to a pre-defined schedule, 2 years|Number of patients with pulmonary relapse by symptoms, Pulmonary relapse based on patient-reported symptoms leading to positive finding in x-ray and or conventional chest CT between two control imaging rounds., 2 years
After primary treatment with curative intent for soft tissue sarcoma, patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria and giving informed consent are enrolled. In study protocol patients have their regular chest x-ray once in two months plus ultra-low-dose computed tomography imaging is repeated seven times during the first two years of follow-up. After two years patients without detectable metastases continue in regular follow-up program. The aims of this prospective comparative study are to investigate whether ultra-low-dose computed tomography is more accurate than chest x-ray in soft tissue sarcoma and especially whether the most fast-growing pulmonary metastases could be detected earlier.
