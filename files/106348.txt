A Study of CHS-114 in Combination With Toripalimab and/or Other Treatments in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of CHS-114 in combination with toripalimab and/or other standard of care (SOC) compound(s) in participants with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
Metastatic Solid Tumor|Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: CHS-114|DRUG: Toripalimab|DRUG: 5 Fluorouracil|DRUG: Cisplatin
Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), From first dose of study drug until 90 days after the last dose of study drug (up to approximately 2.25 years)
Objective Response Rate (ORR) Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 Based on Investigator Assessment, ORR is defined as percentage of participants with confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST v1.1., Up to approximately 2.25 years|Duration of Response (DOR) Per RECIST v1.1 Based on Investigator Assessment, DOR is defined as the time from first documentation of response (CR or PR) to first radiographic documentation of progressive disease or death due to any cause according to RECIST v1.1., Up to approximately 2.25 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR) Per RECIST v1.1 Based on Investigator Assessment, DCR is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve a confirmed CR or PR or stable disease (SD) lasting â‰¥ 12 weeks according to RECIST v1.1., Up to approximately 2.25 years|Progression-free Survival (PFS) Per RECIST v1.1 Based on Investigator Assessment, PFS is defined as the time of the first dose of study treatment to the time of the first documented unequivocal disease progression assessed per RECIST v1.1 or death due to any cause (whichever occurs first)., Up to approximately 2.25 years|Landmark PFS Rates, Months 6, 9, and 12|Maximum Observed Serum Concentration (Cmax) of CHS-114, Up to approximately 2.25 years (pre-infusion and up to 336 hours post-infusion)|Time to Reach Cmax (Tmax) of CHS-114, Up to approximately 2.25 years (pre-infusion and up to 336 hours post-infusion)|Area Under the Concentration-time Curve From Time Zero to Infinity (AUC0-inf) of CHS-114, Up to approximately 2.25 years (pre-infusion and up to 336 hours post-infusion)|Number of Participants With Anti-drug Antibodies (ADAs), Up to approximately 2.25 years
