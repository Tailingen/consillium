Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia
RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a person's white blood cells may make the body build an immune response to kill cancer cells.

PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy in treating patients who have chronic myelogenous leukemia.
Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: recombinant 70-kD heat-shock protein
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the feasibility of vaccination with autologous heat shock protein 70 in patients with chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia.
* Determine the toxicity of this vaccination in these patients.

OUTLINE: Patients undergo leukapheresis to obtain peripheral mononuclear cells (PMNCs). Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) is derived from the autologous PMNCs. Patients receive HSP70 intradermally once weekly for 8 weeks.

Patients are followed for 2 weeks.
