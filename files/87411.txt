A Phase I Study of LXS196 in Patients With Metastatic Uveal Melanoma.
This study was to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and preliminary anti-tumor activity of LXS196 as a single agent and in combination with HDM201 in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma.
