Pembrolizumab-Sacituzumab Govitecan Combination to Treat High-risk, Localized Bladder Cancer
This is a Phase 2, single-center, open-label, non-randomized study in patients with MIBC who cannot receive or refuse to receive cisplatin-based chemotherapy.

Patients will be consecutively enrolled and treated. All patients enrolled who receive at least 1 cycle of study drug will be included in the primary and secondary endpoint analyses.
Muscle-invasive Urothelial Carcinoma of the Bladder
DRUG: Sacituzumab govitecan is a humanized mAb with a hydrolysable linker through which SN-38 is conjugated to the humanized mAb hRS7 IgG1Îº to enhance the delivery of SN-38 to Trop-2- expressing tumors, whi
Clinical CR-rate, To assess whether sacituzumab govitecan plus pembrolizumab is an effective perioperative strategy in patients with clinical T2-3bN0M0 MIBC who cannot receive or refuse to receive cisplatin-based chemotherapy., 36 months
Pathological response-rate,, To evaluate the proportion of patients who will be pathological responders., Upon completion of the study up to 40 months|Bladder-intact event-free survival (BI-EFS);, To evaluate the surgical and medical safety of neoadjuvant combination therapy, as well as of the adjuvant pembrolizumab therapy., Up to 6 months|Overall survival, To assess survival outcomes (event-free survival and overall survival), in the total population and in the subgroups according to the pathological response., Up to 40 months
The general framework of the study will be as follows:

A TURBT for biopsy, histological characterization, and local staging will be executed first, according to the guidelines. With the aim to improve the sensitivity of CT scan in assessing pelvic lymph-nodes and better assess the local extent of bladder tumor, computed tomography (CT) scan, 18FDG-PET/CT scan, and a pelvic MRI will be done during screening and before the surgical assessment to stage and evaluate response. The same imaging assessments will be performed after the neoadjuvant treatment. Patients with the evidence of no detectable disease after neoadjuvant therapy will also undergo a cystoscopy assessment prior to the reTURBT.

* Eligible patients will receive neoadjuvant treatment: 7.5 mg/kg sacituzumab govitecan IV, on days 1, 8, of each 21 day cycle.
* Pembrolizumab will be administered in combination with sacituzumab govitecan on day 1, every 21 days, at the standard dose of 200 mg intravenously.
* A total of 4 cycles is planned before surgery.
* Patients who achieve a clinical complete response (cCR) will be offered a reTURBT instead of radical cystectomy. Patients not achieving a cCR will undergo a radical cystectomy.
* cCR will be defined as the achievement of ALL the following requirements: no evidence of residual disease (VIRADS 0 score) at MRI, negative cystoscopy, and a biopsy obtained via reTURBT revealing no residual viable cancer.
* Surgery will be planned at the time of study inclusion to be done ideally within 4 weeks of the last dose of study drug, and not later than 12 weeks from the last dose of study drug.
* After surgery patients will receive additional 13 cycles of pembrolizumab at the standard dose, every 3 weeks, accounting for a total of 17 cycles of perioperative pembrolizumab(neoadjuvant + adjuvant).
* After cystectomy or reTURBT, patients will undergo imagingassessments according to EAU guidelines. In patients undergoing reTURBT, cystoscopy assessments will be performed every 4 months for the first 2 years (until study conclusion),then according to investigator judgment.
* At the end of the adjuvant period, patients will enter the follow-up period which will lastuntil 12 months from the last dose of pembrolizumab.
