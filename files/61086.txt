TCR-T Cells in the Treatment of Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
To investigate the safety, tolerability, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of TCR-T cells in the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer
Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: TCR-T Cells Injection（GB3010 Cells Injection）
Evaluate the Incidence of Treatment Related Adverse Events of TCRT cells in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, collect adverse events (AE), serious adverse events (SAE), adverse events of special interest (AESI), and laboratory abnormalities (type, frequency, and severity), 2years|Characterize the Peak of Peripheral Blood Concentration and Area under the Peripheral Blood concentration versus time curve of TCRT cells and observe their proliferation and persistence in body, After infusion of neoantigen-specific TCRT cells, collect peak (Cmax) of neoantigen-specific TCRT cells in blood and tumor tissue, time to peak (number of days to peakTCRT cells after infusion), Tmax) and AUC0-28 (area under the curve plotted against visit time by the number of neoantigen-specific TCRT cells in peripheral blood from day 0 to 28). "If possible, AUC0-inf, terminal phase elimination rate constant (λz), elimination half-life (t1/2) will be evaluated.", 2years
Correlation of the pharmacokinetic profile of TCRT cells with the Incidence of CRS and ICANS events, collect changes in mutant cell concentration in peripheral blood and tumor tissue after TCRT cell reinfusion,observe correlation of these measures with CRS and ICANS events, 2years|Evaluate tumor size (mm) , tumor biomarker CA19-9 (U/ml), ORR/DCR/PFS and OS of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, ORR at 2, 4, and 6 months after TCRT cell infusion (ORR=CR+PR). The primary efficacy outcome was the change in target tumor size (local control rate of target lesions). Secondary efficacy indicators: changes in tumor markers; Objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) according to RECIST1.1 criteria, 2years
To explore the correlation between the proliferation and persistence of TCRT cells in body and the efficacy, observe correlation of the PK parameters with response (CR, PR, relapse),PK parameters including peak (Cmax) of neoantigen-specific TCRT cells in blood and tumor tissue, time to peak (number of days to peakTCRT cells after infusion), Tmax) and AUC0-28 (area under the curve plotted against visit time by the number of neoantigen-specific TCRT cells in peripheral blood from day 0 to 28)., 2years
The aim of this clinical trial is to investigate the safety, tolerability, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of TCR-T cell therapy in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer by intravenous injection, in order to explore an effective cellular immunotherapy method for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer
