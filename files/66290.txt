Study of LM-302 in Patients With Advance Solid Tumors
A Phase I/II Study of LM-302 in Patients with CLDN18.2-Positive Advanced Solid Tumors
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: LM-302 Injection
Dose limiting toxicity (DLT), DLT is defined as a toxicity (adverse event at least possibly related to LM302) occurring during the DLT observation period, Cycle 1 of each cohort. Duration of one cycle is 21 days|Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events, The safety profile of LM-302 will be assessed by monitoring the adverse events (AE) per the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v5.0, From signing the ICF until 28 days after EOT or accept other anti-cancer therapy|Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D), The RP2D will be determined during the dose expansion stage of the study. RP2D will be determined using available safety and efficacy data, up to 21 days following first dose|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), The MTD is defined as the dose of which the toxicity rate during the DLT observation period (21 days after the first administration in cycle 1 on day 1)., up to 21 days following first dose
Area under plasma concentration vs time curve (AUC) for LM-302, changes in AUC over time in participants with LM-302, Up to finished cycle 5 (each cycle is 21 days)
A Phase I/II, First-in-Human, Open-Label, Dose Escalation and Expansion Study of LM-302 in Patients with CLDN18.2-Positive Advanced Solid Tumors The study includes phase I (dose escalation) to determine MTD/RP2D and phase II (dose expansion) to assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity, etc..
