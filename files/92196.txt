A Study of Alectinib (CH5424802/RO5424802) in Participants With Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK)-Rearranged Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
This non-randomized, open-label, multicenter study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of alectinib in participants with ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer who failed crizotinib treatment.
