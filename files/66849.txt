Retrospective Analysis of Lymphomas and Cancers Synchronous Occurrence in Picardy From 2007 to 2012
Cancer is the leading cause of death in man and the second leading cause in women with 85,000 and 63,000 deaths, respectively, in 2012. A working group led by Holly L. Howe, PhD, in 2002 defined primary neoplasia Such as the occurrence and diagnosis of two or more independent neoplasms of different histology in the same patient. The occurrence of a new cancer has become more frequent in recent years: the prevalence of multiple primary neoplasia (NPM) is estimated between 0.73% and 11.7%. According to the French data, the risk of second cancer in people who have already had a first cancer is increased by 36% compared to the general population. Several studies have reported an increase in the risk of cancer after treatment of lymphoma but there are currently no studies on the occurrence of lymphoma and cancer of synchronous occurrence.

In our department, 19 patients presented cancer and lymphoma synchronously, that is to say 6 months between 2007 and 2012.

The main objective is to show that there is an increase in the incidence of cancers in patients diagnosed for lymphoma synchronously. Secondary objectives are to describe the clinical and biological characteristics of the patients concerned and to formulate hypotheses on the physiopathological mechanisms involved: peri-tumoral B-cell lymphoproliferation, alteration of the immune system or rearrangement of the BCR.

In a second step, the investigator could propose a multicenter epidemiological study using data from the different Cancer Registries. If results are confirmed in a larger cohort, recommendations could be made.
