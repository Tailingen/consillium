Pilot Study on the Infusion of ARI-0001 Cells in Patients With CD19+ Leukemia or Lymphoma Refractory to Therapy
To assess the infusion of ARI-0001 cells (Adult differentiated autologous T-cells from peripheral blood, expanded and transduced with a lentivirus to express a chimeric antigen receptor with anti-CD19 specificity \[A3B1\] conjugated with the co-stimulatory regions 4-1BB and CD3z ) safety on patients with leukemia or lymphoma CD19+ resistant or refractory to treatment and with a prognosis of less than 2 years.
Leukemia|Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: Adult differentiated autologous T-cells
Procedure-related mortality (PRM), Any death not caused directly by leukemia / lymphoma. For the estimation of PRM, relapse or progression of the disease will be considered as a competitive event., Year 1|Procedure-related mortality (PRM), Any death not caused directly by leukemia / lymphoma. For the estimation of PRM, relapse or progression of the disease will be considered as a competitive event., Year 3|Assessment of toxicity, number of adverse events grade III-IV using CTC (common toxicity criteria), Month 3|Assessment of toxicity, number of adverse events grade III-IV using CTC (common toxicity criteria), Year 1
Response rate (overall and complete), Defined differently for each disease:

* On chronic lymphoid and acute lymphocytic leukemia, the usual criteria NCCN and IWCLL will be used.
* On non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, the Lugano criteria will be used-
* On patients with leukemia will be quantified the persistence of minimal residual disease, in bone marrow and peripheral blood, using multiparametric cytometry and new generation sequencing techniques., Month 3 and Year 1|Progression-free survival, Time lag between infusion of ARI-0001 and the progression of disease or death. Patients alive and in complete remission will be censored at the last follow-up, Year 2 after procedure|Overall survival (OS) at 2 years, Time lag between the infusion of ARI-0001 and the death of the patient from any cause. Living patients will be censored at the the last follow-up., 3 years|In vivo survival of ARI-0001 cells in peripheral blood, bone marrow and cerebrospinal fluid, Determined monthly during the first 6 months by flow cytometry and quantitative transgene PCR., months 1,2,3,4,5,6|In vivo survival of ARI-0001 cells in peripheral blood, bone marrow and cerebrospinal fluid, Determined quarterly from month 6 until the 2 years after infusion, by flow cytometry and quantitative transgene PCR., months 9,12,15,18,21,24|Quality of life of included patients, Evaluated by a questionnaire completed by patients or their legal guardians, Month 3, 6, 12|Toxicity assessment, defined as number of adverse events of any type occurring throughout the study using the common toxicity criteria, Month 3 and year 1
