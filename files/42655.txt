APBI Proton Feasibility and Phase II Study
The overall objectives of the study are to establish feasibility and acute side effects of accelerated partial breast irradiation therapy, along with more long-term side effects and clinical efficacy of treatment.
Stage IA-IIA Breast Cancer
RADIATION: Proton Therapy
Feasibility and the Acute Toxicity Profile of Accelerated Partial Breast Radiation Using Protons, Number of Participants that meets the criteria of feasibility and acute toxicity will be reported. The objectives were both feasibility and acute toxicity profile of accelerated partial breast radiation using protons. Feasibility was based on multiple radiation planning and treatment parameters: (1) a patient cannot be given treatment because anatomy is such that a dosimetrically satisfactory treatment plan cannot be devised; (2) a patient is unable to tolerate more than 20% of treatments using proton RT (ie, \>2 of the 10 fractions); and/or (3) a patient is unable to complete all treatment within 5 days of the estimated date of treatment completion or requires a treatment break of greater than 5 days. A feasibility rate \>90% was needed to proceed to the phase 2 portion.

Outcomes measured and reported were: late toxicity was "% of participants with grade 3 or higher late toxicity", 2 years
The purpose of the APBI Proton Therapy study is to examine the feasibility, side effects, and clinical efficacy of using proton therapy on only the tumor bed of women being treated for breast cancer after surgical removal of malignancy (as opposed to whole breast treatment). The study's aim is to establish the effects of this type of therapy as it compares to both traditional radiation and whole breast treatment therapies. In order to be eligible, the patient must be a female older than 50 with either invasive ductal, medullary, papillary, colloid (mucinous) or tubular histologies of stage IA-IIA breast cancer, ECOG performance status of 0-2, have margins of greater than or equal to 2mm, be node negative or have only microscopic node disease, have estrogen- or progesterone-positive breast cancer, and other eligibility criteria must be met that is more detailed to describe herein.
