This is an open label, phase II study to evaluate the capacity of Rituximab (Mabthera®) plus Lenalidomide (Revlimid®) to induce objective responses in patients with Mucosa Associated Lymphoid Tissue (MALT) lymphoma presenting with measurable disease.
Lymphoma of the Mucosa Associated Lymphoid Tissue (MALT)
DRUG: Rituximab and Lenalidomide
Objective Responses in Patients With MALT Lymphoma Presenting With Measureable Disease, The primary objective of this Phase II study is to evaluate the proportion of patients responding to Lenalidomide and Rituximab. In case of a response rate of \< 40%, the combination is rejected as ineffective, while an active combination is defined at a minimum response rate of 60% based of findings with rituximab and lenalidomide mono-therapy., 40 weeks
