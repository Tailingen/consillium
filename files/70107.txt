Exploratory Study to Assess the Short Term Intratumoural and Peripheral Effects of BN83495 in Postmenopausal Women With Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer
This trial will assess the intratumoural pharmacological activity of BN83495 by changes in intratumoural levels of sex hormones and associated inhibition of steroid sulphatase (STS) activity.
