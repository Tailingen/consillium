Comparison of Nerve-sparing Techniques in Radical Prostatectomy for Oncological Outcome and Functional Recovery.
To evaluate the difference among three nerve-sparing techniques(unilateral intrafascial resection, bilateral intrafascial resection, bilateral extrafascial resection) of oncological outcome and functional recovery.
Prostate Cancer

perioperative complications, the complications that occur in perioperation, perioperation|positive rate of incisal margin, the rate of patients who have positive incisal margin after the operation, day 0|prostate cancer-specific survival, the survival for prostate cancer, 3 years
Surgery is a common and effective treatment for localized prostate cancer. The main objective of surgical treatment is to remove the tumor completely in order to achieve the goal of cure. Intrafascial nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy is a radical resection of prostate cancer with minimal damage to the nerves and blood vessels.

There are nerves around the prostate that affect sexual function, and damage to these nerves can lead to complications like sexual dysfunction and incontinence. Therefore, how to completely remove the tumor, as far as possible to preserve these nerves, become an important issue in the surgical treatment.

This study is aim to evaluate the different among nerve-sparing strategies, including unilateral intrafascial resection, bilateral intrafascial resection and bilateral extrafascial resection, on oncological outcome and functional recovery, so as to provide clinical evidence for nerve-sparing surgery of prostate cancer via robot-assisted posterior approach.
