A Study of RO6870810/TEN-010 in Participants With Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Myelodysplastic Syndrome
RO6870810 (formerly TEN-010) is a small molecule, bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) bromodomain inhibitor. This study is designed to characterize the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of RO6870810 monotherapy in participants with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (RR-AML) and hypomethylating agent (HMA)-refractory myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The study will consist of a Screening Period, Treatment Period, and Post-Treatment Period. A standard 3+3 design will be used in which successive cohorts of three or more participants with RR-AML or HMA-refractory MDS will be treated at escalating doses until a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is identiﬁed. Up to 51 adult participants with AML or MDS will be enrolled in the study.
