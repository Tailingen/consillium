ZEN003694 and Enzalutamide Versus Enzalutamide Monotherapy in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer
This is an open-label, randomized, Phase 2b study of ZEN003694 in combination with enzalutamide vs. enzalutamide monotherapy in patients with mCRPC who have progressed on prior abiraterone by PCWG3 criteria. Disease must have progressed on only abiraterone by PCWG3 criteria prior to study entry.

The patient population will be separated into two cohorts:

Cohort A: Patients with poor response to prior abiraterone defined as:

* Abiraterone started in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC) disease setting: \< 12 months duration on abiraterone or failure to achieve PSA nadir of 0.2 ng/mL while taking abiraterone, or;
* Abiraterone started in castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) disease setting: \< 6 months duration on abiraterone or failure to achieve PSA50 response while on abiraterone

Cohort B: Patients with response to prior abiraterone, defined as:

* Abiraterone started in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC) disease setting: ≥ 12 months duration on abiraterone and nadir PSA \< 0.2 ng/mL, or;
* Abiraterone started in castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) disease setting: ≥ 6 months duration on abiraterone and confirmed PSA50 response

Radiographic progression of disease will be evaluated by RECIST 1.1 and PCWG3 by investigator assessment. Clinical progression is significant pain increase or clinical deterioration that requires initiating another line of treatment., Randomization up to 30 months|Cohort A + B: Progression-free survival (PFS) by investigator assessment, Time from date of randomization to the date of first disease radiographic progression, clinical progression, or death for any reason. Radiographic progression of disease will be evaluated by RECIST 1.1 and PCWG3 by investigator assessment. Clinical progression is significant pain increase or clinical deterioration that requires initiating another line of treatment., Randomization up to 30 months|Cohort A: Overall survival (OS), Time from date of randomization to the date of death from any cause, Randomization up to 30 months|Cohort A + B: Overall survival (OS), Time from date of randomization to the date of death from any cause, Randomization up to 30 months|Cohort A: PSA50 response rate, PSA response is a reduction in serum PSA concentration of ≥50% from baseline., Randomization up to 30 months|Cohort A + B: PSA50 response rate, PSA response is a reduction in serum PSA concentration of ≥50% from baseline., Randomization up to 30 months|Cohort A: Assess efficacy endpoints for patients enrolled in the USA, Randomization up to 30 months|Cohort A + B: Assess efficacy endpoints for patients enrolled in the USA, Randomization up to 30 months|Objective response rate (ORR), Proportion of the patients who have either a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) by RECIST 1.1 criteria who have measurable disease at baseline., Randomization up to 30 months|Patient-reported health status and quality of life (QoL) measured by European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), EORTC QLQ-C30: cancer-specific instrument with 30 questions to assess the participant QoL. First 28 questions used to evaluate 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain) and other single items (dyspnea, appetite loss, insomnia, constipation, diarrhea, financial difficulties). Each question assessed on a 4-point scale (1= not at all, 2= a little, 3= quite a bit, 4= very much); functional scales: higher score = better level of functioning; symptom scale: higher score = more severe symptoms; for single items: higher score= more severe problem. Last 2 questions used to evaluate global health status (GHS)/QoL. Each question was assessed on 7-point scale (1= very poor to 7= excellent). Scores averaged, transformed to 0-100 scale; higher score=better quality of life/better level of functioning., Screening and Day 1 of every 28-day Cycle up to 30 months|Patient-reported health status and quality of life (QoL) measured by European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Prostate Module (EORTC QLQ-PR25)., EORTC QLQ-PR25: prostate cancer specific instrument with 25 questions used in conjunction with EORTC QLQ-C30 to assess the participant QoL. Used to evaluate 5 multi-item scales (urinary, bowel, and hormonal treatment-related symptoms, sexual activity, and sexual functioning) and one single item (problems due to incontinence aid use). Each question assessed on a 4-point scale (1= not at all, 2= a little, 3= quite a bit, 4= very much). Scores averaged, transformed to 0-100 scale; higher score=better quality of life/better level of functioning., Screening and Day 1 of every 28-day Cycle up to 30 months|Time to initiation of chemotherapy, Time from date of randomization to the first dose of chemotherapy., Randomization up to 30 months|Time to first skeletal related event (SRE), Time from date of randomization to the first SRE such as pathological fracture, surgery/radiotherapy for pain/prevention of fracture, hypercalcemia, and spinal cord compression., Randomization up to 30 months|Measure plasma concentrations of ZEN003694 and the active metabolite ZEN003791, Plasma concentrations of ZEN003694 and the active metabolite ZEN003791 will be measured., Cycle 1 Day 1: Pre-dose, 1 hour, 2 hours, and 4 hours post-dose; Cycle 2 Day1: Pre-dose, 1 hour, 2 hours, and 4 hours post-dose
