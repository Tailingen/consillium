Mechanical Stimulation in Preventing Bone Density Loss in Patients Undergoing Donor Stem Cell Transplant
This pilot clinical trial studies mechanical stimulation in preventing bone density loss in patients undergoing donor stem cell transplant. Mechanical stimulation may limit, prevent, or reverse bone loss, increase muscle and cardiac performance, and improve overall health

PROCEDURE: management of therapy complications|PROCEDURE: musculoskeletal complications management/prevention
Refinement of mechanical stimulation protocol, Best time of day for treatment, staff involvement, etc., From hospital admission to 100 days post-HCT|Adherence with treatment, From hospital admission to 100 days post-HCT|Effective data collection tools and data points, From hospital admission to 100 days post-HCT
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the feasibility of a mechanical stimulation regimen in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) patients.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate the data collection tools to prepare for a larger phase II trial.

OUTLINE:

Patients undergo mechanical stimulation over 20 minutes once daily (QD) beginning on date of hospital admission and continuing through day 100 post-HCT, except for day 0 (date of transplant).
