Study of the EZH2 Inhibitor Tazemetostat in Malignant Mesothelioma
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, open-label, 2-part, single-arm, 2-stage study of tazemetostat 800 mg two times a day (BID) administered orally. Screening of subjects to determine eligibility for the study will be performed within 21 days of the first planned dose of tazemetostat.

In Part 1: planned to enroll 12 subjects with relapsed or refractory malignant mesothelioma regardless of BAP1 status will be treated and undergo pharmacokinetics (PK) blood sample collection after a single tazemetostat 800 mg.

Part 2 plans to include 55 subjects with BAP1-deficient relapsed or refractory malignant mesothelioma.

Treatment with tazemetostat will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent, or termination of the study. Response assessment will be evaluated after 6 weeks of treatment and then every 12 weeks thereafter while on study.

DRUG: Tazemetostat
Part 1: Pharmacokinetics Profile of Tazemetostat and Its Metabolite (Plasma): Cmax, To assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety profile of single (Cycle 1 day 1) and repeated doses (Cycle 1 day 2 onwards) of 800 mg tazemetostat administered as 400 mg tablets in subjects with relapsed or refractory malignant mesothelioma regardless of BRCA1 associated protein 1 (BAP1) status., Cycle 1 Day 15: pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 post-dose|Part 1: Pharmacokinetics Profile of Tazemetostat and Its Metabolite (Plasma): Tmax, Cycle 1 Day 15: pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and12 post-dose.|Part 1: Pharmacokinetics Profile of Tazemetostat and Its Metabolite (Plasma): AUC(0-t), To assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety profile of single (Cycle 1 day 1) and repeated doses (Cycle 1 day 2 onwards) of 800 mg tazemetostat administered as 400 mg tablets in subjects with relapsed or refractory malignant mesothelioma regardless of BRCA1 associated protein 1 (BAP1) status, Cycle 1 Day 15: pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and12 post-dose.|Part 1: Pharmacokinetics Profile of Tazemetostat and Its Metabolite (Plasma): AUC(0-∞), Pharmacokinetics profile of tazemetostat and its metabolite (plasma) assessing AUC(0-∞), Cycle 1 Day 15: pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 post-dose|Part 1: Pharmacokinetics Profile of Tazemetostat and Its Metabolite (Plasma): t1/2, Results from assessing the half-life of Tazemetostat and its metabolite shown below, Cycle 1 Day 15: pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 post-dose|Part 2: To Assess Disease Control Rate (DCR) Defined as Number of Subjects With Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR) and Stable Disease (SD), Overall, the disease control rate (DCR) (calculated as subjects with CR + subjects with PR + subjects with SD at 12 weeks in duration), and the DCR at 24 weeks., The patients were assessed for DCR for up to 24 weeks|Incidence of Treatment-emergent Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, From the first dose of study treatment until the earlier of either 30 days after the discontinuation of study treatment or until the initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy.
Part 1 and 2: Objective Response Rate (ORR; Complete Response + Partial Response [CR + PR]), ORR (confirmed CR+PR) to tazemetostat in subjects with relapsed/refractory malignant mesothelioma using disease-appropriate standardized response criteria (modified RECIST or RECIST 1.1), Assessed every 6 weeks for duration of study participation which is estimated to be 12 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS), Progression-Free Survival is defined as the interval of time between the date of the first dose of study drug and the earliest date of disease progression or death due to any cause. PFS was analyzed and listed for the ITT population. PFS was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method., The patients were assessed for PFS for up to 24 weeks|Part 1 and 2: Overall Survival (OS), OS was analyzed and listed for the ITT population. Subjects who have not died were censored at the date of last contact which was identified from a visit date, study assessment (physical examination, vital signs, ECOG performance status, electrocardiogram \[ECG\], study drug record, radiological evaluation), AE, medication, or disposition information.

OS was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. OS at 12 and 24 weeks along with the associated 2-sided 95% CIs were provided. Median OS, first and third quartiles and associated 95% 2-sided CIs were provided., The patients were assessed for PFS for up to 24 weeks|Part 1 and 2: To Evaluate the Duration of Response (DOR) in Subjects With Confirmed CR or PR, DOR was calculated for subjects with a confirmed CR or PR. DOR is defined as the time from the date of the initial response (CR/PR) to the date of first documented PD or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.

DOR censoring rules followed those of the PFS analysis defined in the SAP. DOR was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier methods and the median DOR, first quartile, and third quartile was presented. The associated 2- sided 95% CIs was estimated., Every 6 weeks up to disease progression or start of new anti-cancer therapy assessed for up to 12 months|Part 1: To Assess Disease Control Rate (DCR) Defined as Number of Subjects With Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR) and Stable Disease (SD), Overall, the disease control rate (DCR) (calculated as subjects with CR + subjects with PR + subjects with SD at 12 weeks in duration), and the DCR at 24 weeks., The patients were assessed for DCR for up to 24 weeks
