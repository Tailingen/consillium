A Study to Assess the Safety and the Efficacy of IV Fosnetupitant/Palonosetron (260 mg/0.25 mg) Combination Compared to Oral Netupitant/Palonosetron (300 mg/0.5 mg) Combination for the Prevention of CINV in AC Chemotherapy in Women With Breast Cancer
Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group, stratified study assessing the safety and describing the efficacy of a single dose of intravenous (IV) fosnetupitant/palonosetron (260 mg/0.25 mg) infusion \[test\] versus oral netupitant/palonosetron (300 mg/0.5 mg) combination \[control\]; each administered with oral dexamethasone prior to initial and repeated cycles of AC chemotherapy in female breast cancer patients.
Chemotherapy-induced Nausea and Vomiting
DRUG: fosnetupitant/ palonosetron|DRUG: netupitant/palonosetron|DRUG: dexamethasone
Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent AEs at Cycle 1, At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent AEs All Cycles, At the end of Cycle 4 (each cycle is 21 days)|Number of Participants With Severe (i.e., CTCAE Grade ≥3) TEAEs Reported for ≥2% of Patients in Either Treatment Group and Overall Throughout the Study, At the end of Cycle 4 (each cycle is 21 days)|Number of Participants With Study-Drug-Related TEAEs Reported for ≥2% of Patients in Either Treatment Group Throughout the Study, At the end of Cycle 4 (each cycle is 21 days)
Complete Response in Cycle 1 During the Acute Phase, defined as no emetic episodes \[vomit or retch\] and no rescue medication, 24 hours after the start of AC chemotherapy administration|Complete Response in Cycle 1 During the Delayed Phase, defined as no emetic episodes \[vomit or retch\] and no rescue medication, 120 hour after the start of AC chemotherapy administration|Complete Response in Cycle 1 During the Overall Phase, defined as no emetic episodes \[vomit or retch\] and no rescue medication, 0-120 hours after the start of AC chemotherapy|Overall Percentage of Patients With NIDL Based on FLIE Scores for Cycles 1, Percentage (including two-sided 95% CI using Wilson score method) of patients with NIDL based on FLIE scores (overall, by domain, and by individual item) are summarized by treatment group. NIDL was defined as a score greater than 108 points, 54 points, and 6 points for total FLIE score, domain score, and single item score, respectively. Differences between treatment groups for total FLIE score and domain scores (nausea and vomiting) were presented with two-sided 95% CIs using the CMH method adjusted for region and age class strata and also using Newcombe-Wilson's method without strata adjustment.

No Impact on Daily Life (NIDL) Based on Functional Living Index-Emesis (FLIE) Scores. The FLIE is a nausea and vomiting specific self report instrument comprised of two domains (nausea and vomiting) with nine identical items in each domain, cycle 1
