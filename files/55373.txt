Post Transplant Cyclophosphamide in Matched Unrelated Donor Stem Cell Transplantation for Hematological Malignancies
This study aims to evaluate the clinical efficacy of cyclophosphamide in patients receiving a bone marrow graft from a matched unrelated donor in overall survival, progression free survival and cumulative incidence of acute and chronic GvHD. Thirty patients will receive cyclophosphamide while twenty patients will receive antihuman T-lymphocyte immune globulin (ATG).
