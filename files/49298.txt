Study of Dasatinib in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of Segment 1 of the study is to determine the effect of ketoconazole on dasatinib. The purpose of Segment 2 is to learn how dasatinib affects tumor growth in patients with advanced solid tumors.
Tumors
DRUG: Dasatinib + Ketoconazole
Segment 1: Determine whether the steady state pharmacokinetics of 20 mg of dasatinib are affected by co-administration with ketoconazole in patients with advanced solid tumors|Segment 2: Assess the pharmacodynamic activity of dasatinib
Segment 1: Evaluate the safety and tolerability of dasatinib alone and when co-administered with ketoconazole|Segment 2: Explore the association between tumor response and the pre-clinically identified markers and other mRNA gene expression level
The purpose of Segment 1 of the study is to determine the effect of ketoconazole on dasatinib. The purpose of Segment 2 is to learn how dasatinib affects tumor growth in patients with advanced solid tumors.
