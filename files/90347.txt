Functional Lung Imaging With DECT and 4DCT
The basic premise of this pilot study is to enroll 40 patients over 3 years who have Stage II, III, or IV non-small cell lung cancer and are planned for definitive treatment with concurrent chemoradiation where a contrast enhanced 4DCT is planned.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
PROCEDURE: contrast enhanced 4DCT
evaluate the reproducibility of PBV DECT imaging and 4DCT derived lung ventilation for evaluating lung function, 3 years|correlate changes of PBV DECT and 4DCT lung function images seen at ~6 months with radiation dose and with patient reported outcome quality of life, 3 years
â€¢ To propose a novel biologic (i.e. functional) dose volume algorithm to reduce PBV and 4DCT lung function changes, 3 years
