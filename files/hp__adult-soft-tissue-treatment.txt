Incidence and Mortality
Estimated new cases and deaths from soft tissue sarcoma  in the  United States in 2025:[
1
]
New cases: 13,520.
Deaths: 5,410.
The reported international incidence of soft tissue sarcoma ranges from 1.8 to 5 cases  per 100,000 individuals per year.[
2
] The rate of new cases of soft tissue cancer in the United States was 3.4 per 100,000 people per year based on age-adjusted cases from 2017 to 2021. The death rate was 1.3 per 100,000 people per year based on age-adjusted  deaths from 2018 to 2022.[
3
]
Risk Factors
Most soft tissue sarcomas are sporadic. Risk factors include:[
4
-
6
]
Previous radiation therapy.
Chronic lymphedema (risk factor for lymphangiosarcoma).
Exposure to the chemicals thorium dioxide (Thorotrast), vinyl chloride, or arsenic. These  are established carcinogens for hepatic angiosarcomas.
HIV  and human herpesvirus 8 infection. These viruses have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Kaposi sarcoma. For more information, see
Kaposi Sarcoma Treatment
.
Soft tissue sarcomas occur more frequently in patients with the following inherited syndromes:[
4
-
6
]
Li-Fraumeni
syndrome (
TP53
pathogenic variant).
von Recklinghausen disease (neurofibromatosis type 1;
NF1
pathogenic variant).
Gardner syndrome (
APC
pathogenic variant).
Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (Gorlin syndrome;
PTCH1
pathogenic variant).
Tuberous sclerosis (Bourneville disease;
TSC1
or
TSC2
pathogenic variant).
Werner
syndrome (adult progeria;
WRN
pathogenic variant).
Clinical Features
Soft tissue sarcomas are a heterogenous family of malignant tumors that may arise in nearly any organ system. The anatomical distribution in adults is as follows:[
5
]
Extremities (45%).
Intra-abdominal organs (38%).
Trunk (10%).
Head and neck (5%).
Diagnostic Evaluation
Adequate
tissue should be obtained via either image-guided core-needle biopsy or planned incisional biopsy (for select cases). The samples should be reviewed by a pathologist who is experienced in diagnosing sarcomas.  Careful
planning of the initial biopsy, with consultation among the surgeon, radiation oncologist, and interventional radiologist, is important to avoid compromising subsequent
curative resection. In general, incisional biopsies are reserved for patients whose prior core-needle biopsies were nondiagnostic or when a core-needle biopsy cannot be safely performed because of anatomical constraints.
Before any intervention is initiated, imaging is performed to evaluate the sarcoma and determine if there are metastases. The following modalities may be used as clinically indicated:
Plain radiography.
Computed tomography (CT).
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Positron emission tomography (PET) scan and bone scan. May be used along with CT. PET imaging is particularly useful for sarcoma subtypes with a propensity for lymph node metastases (e.g., synovial sarcoma, clear cell sarcoma, angiosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and epithelioid sarcoma).
Prognostic Factors
Poor prognostic factors in adults with soft tissue sarcomas include:[
4
-
15
]
Age
older than 60 years.
Tumor size (e.g., larger than 5 cm in greatest dimension, variable impact depending on sarcoma subtype).
High histological grade of the tumor (incorporating histology-specific differentiation, mitotic rate, and extent of tumor necrosis).
Advanced pathological stage of the tumor at the time of diagnosis.
Positive tumor margins after surgery.[
10
]
Small low-grade tumors, particularly in the trunk or extremities, are frequently curable by surgery alone. Higher-grade sarcomas are associated with higher local-treatment failure
rates and increased metastatic potential.[
16
]
Prognostic nomograms (incorporating specific variables) have been developed for soft tissue sarcomas of the retroperitoneum and the extremities.[
11
-
14
]
Follow-Up Testing
PET and CT imaging may have higher sensitivity than contrast-enhanced CT imaging when recurrent sarcoma is suspected. Late recurrences (more than 5 years from initial diagnosis) are seen with some histologies, such as synovial sarcoma or alveolar soft-part sarcoma.[
17
,
18
]
Evidence (posttreatment imaging surveillance):
A retrospective review included 174 consecutive patients with soft tissue sarcoma of the limb who underwent follow-up by oncologists at a single center from 2003 to 2009.[
19
][
Level of evidence C2
]  The rate and site of recurrence  and mode of detection were analyzed. The following results were reported:
Eighty-two patients (47%) experienced relapse.
Isolated local recurrences occurred in 26 patients, and local relapse with synchronous pulmonary metastases occurred in 5 patients.
Local recurrences were detected clinically in 30 of the 31 patients.
MRI identified only one local recurrence.
Twenty-eight patients (16%) developed isolated lung metastases.
The lung metastases were amenable to resections in nine patients, seven of whom were free of disease after treatment.
Lung metastases were detected by chest x-ray in 19 patients, by CT scan in 3 patients, and clinically in 11 patients.
Twenty-three patients developed nonpulmonary metastases.
More than 80% of the relapses occurred in the first 2 years of follow-up. Later recurrences were also observed.
This study supports imaging surveillance for detection of lung metastases. Local recurrences at the primary site were usually detected by clinical examination. The impact of metastases detection on overall survival or quality of life is unknown.[

Cellular Classification of Soft Tissue Sarcoma
Soft tissue sarcomas are heterogeneous, with more than 100 different entities described in the  World Health Organization (WHO) 2020 classification.[
1
]
Soft tissue sarcomas are classified histologically according to the presumed tissue of origin.  Immunohistochemistry,
flow cytometry, molecular profiling, and, rarely, electron microscopy may identify particular subtypes within the major histological categories. Some subtypes of sarcomas are characterized by genetic events such as chromosomal translocations (e.g., translocation t(X;18)(p11;q11) in synovial sarcomas and translocation t(12;16)(q13;p11) in myxoid liposarcomas).[

Staging Evaluation
In addition to histology, identifying the location and extent of disease (e.g., localized, locally advanced, metastatic) is important in determining the most effective initial treatment for
patients with soft tissue sarcoma.[
1
]
Imaging tests used in the staging evaluation may include:[
1
-
5
]
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)  and/or computed tomography (CT) scan of the primary tumor area.
Chest CT scan for high-grade sarcomas  to look for metastasis to the lung (the most common site of distant spread).
Abdominal/pelvic CT scan.
Positron emission tomography (PET) scan.
Some staging evaluation procedures depend on the tumor histology and site, including:
CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis and whole spine MRI for round cell and myxoid liposarcomas, as these histologies can have extrapulmonary spread to unusual sites.[
6
]
Brain imaging for subtypes that have a higher propensity for central nervous system involvement, such as angiosarcoma, epithelioid sarcoma, or alveolar soft-part sarcoma.
Knowledge of intracompartmental or extracompartmental extension of extremity sarcomas is
important for surgical decision making.  For complete staging, a thorough
review of all
biopsy specimens, including those from the primary tumor, lymph nodes, or other
suspicious lesions, is essential.  Nodal involvement is rare, occurring in
less than 3% of patients with sarcoma, but it occurs more often in certain subtypes, such as rhabdomyosarcoma, angiosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, clear cell sarcoma, and epithelioid sarcoma.[

American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Staging System
The 2017 AJCC/Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) cancer staging classification system recommends the use of the three-tiered  French Federation of Comprehensive Cancer Centers (Fédération Nationale des Centres de Lutte Contre Le Cancer [FNCLCC]) Sarcoma Group grading schema.  Prognostic factors required for stage grouping are from FNCLCC. The definitions of grade are provided in
Table 6
. Of note, staging is primarily used as a research tool and does not routinely impact decision making outside of the factors listed above (sarcoma subtype and grade, primary location, extent of disease [localized, locally advanced, distant metastases]).
The AJCC staging system  has designated stage by the following criteria:[
1
-
5
]
Tumor size, nodal status, metastasis, histological grade (TNMG).
Anatomical primary tumor site (head and neck, trunk and extremities, abdomen and thoracic visceral organs, retroperitoneum, and unusual histologies and sites).
For information on unusual histologies and sites, see the eighth edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual,[
1
] which indicates that the TNMG staging classification has different T staging criteria and prognostic groups based on the primary tumor site (see
Table 1
). The characteristic molecular markers of some sarcomas are not formally incorporated in the staging system pending further evaluation of their impact on prognosis.[
2
-
5
]
Recurrent sarcomas are restaged using the same system that is used for primary tumors, with the notation that the tumor is recurrent.

FNCLCC histological grade
The histological grade of the sarcoma is an important factor in staging all soft tissue sarcomas. It is determined by the following three parameters:
Histology-specific tumor differentiation (see
Table 4
).
Mitotic activity.
Extent of tumor necrosis.
The purpose of the grading system is to predict which patients will develop metastasis and therefore benefit from postoperative chemotherapy.[
9
,
10
] Each parameter is scored, and the scores are then added to determine the FNCLCC histological grade (see

Planning Therapy
Complete
staging and treatment planning by a multidisciplinary team of cancer
specialists is required to determine the optimal treatment for patients with soft tissue sarcoma. In most cases, a combined modality approach of preoperative radiation therapy (preRT) or postoperative radiation therapy (PORT) is used for treatment, rather than a radical surgical procedure such as amputation. 
Surgery without PORT may be possible in selected cases.  The role of chemotherapy is not well defined.
Specialized centers
There is evidence that favorable clinical outcomes may be associated with referral to a specialized sarcoma treatment center.
Evidence (referral to a specialized sarcoma treatment center):
An analysis of a population-based consecutive series of 375 patients with soft tissue sarcoma in Sweden reported the following results:[
1
][
Level of evidence C2
]
The local recurrence rate was 45% (35 of 78 patients) in patients who were not referred.
The local recurrence rate was 24% (24 of 102 patients) in patients who were referred after initial surgery or incisional biopsy.
The local recurrence rate was 18% (36 of 195 patients) in patients who were referred before any surgical procedure.
Local recurrence rates in patients with resected tumors were higher in those who were not referred (for the primary tumor) to the specialized center (
P
= .0001 for the difference between those not referred vs. those referred before any surgical procedure).
There were no statistically significant differences in death from sarcoma among the groups.
A British study of   260 patients with soft tissue sarcoma diagnosed within a 3-year period reported the following results:[
2
]
Thirty-seven percent of the patients had most of their treatment at a specialized center.
The remaining  63% were treated at 38 different hospitals.
The rate of local recurrence was 19% for patients treated at the specialized center.
The rate of local recurrence was 39% for patients treated at the district general hospitals, even though the tumors in these patients were smaller and of lower grade.
The most significant factors affecting survival were tumor grade (high grade vs. low grade) and the depth of the tumor.
Patients treated at the specialized center had a small survival advantage after multivariate analysis.

Patient selection factors may vary among surgeons.  In general, surgery alone is considered in patients with low-grade tumors of the extremity or superficial trunk that are  5 cm or smaller in diameter (T1) and have microscopically negative surgical margins. In these patients, the rate of long-term local tumor control is about 90%.[
7
]
Extremity tumors
When feasible, wide-margin function-sparing surgical excision is the cornerstone of effective treatment for extremity tumors. This may be facilitated by soft tissue reconstructive surgery, which generally permits wider margins than those obtained when the surgical plan involves direct closure of the excision site.[
8
]  Cutting into the tumor mass or shelling out the gross tumor is associated with an elevated risk of local recurrence.  Even for high-grade disease, soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities can usually be effectively treated while preserving the limb with combined-modality treatment consisting of preRT  or PORT to reduce local recurrence.[
9
]  For more information, see  the
Radiation Therapy
section.
Evidence (amputation vs. limb-sparing surgery):
A retrospective study analyzed a prospective sarcoma database of 649 patients with extremity soft tissue sarcoma. Ninety-two patients underwent amputation, and 557 patients had a limb-sparing procedure. Patients who underwent amputation had large (≥5 cm) high-grade tumors that invaded major vascular or nervous structures.[
10
]
The patients who underwent amputation achieved significantly better local
control than the patients who had a limb-sparing procedure (
P
= .007).
However, no survival
benefit was demonstrated in the patients selected
for amputation (i.e., patients with large high-grade tumors) when compared
with patients undergoing a limb-sparing procedure with similar
tumors.
Prevention of local recurrence by amputation did
not improve survival in this group compared with similar patients
undergoing limb-sparing surgery who did develop a local recurrence.
A retrospective study included 769 patients with a high-grade sarcoma of the extremities who underwent a limb-sparing surgery. Eighty-nine patients were treated with neoadjuvant radiation therapy, 315 patients were treated with adjuvant irradiation, and 365 patients were treated with surgery alone.[
11
]
After a mean follow-up of 45 months, 95 local recurrences occurred, resulting in a local recurrence-free survival rate of 83.2% after 5 years and 75.9% after 10 years.
Neoadjuvant radiation therapy provided the best local recurrence-free rate for 5 years (90.0%), but after 10 years (78.3%) adjuvant irradiation resulted in better local control.
Patients treated with neoadjuvant radiation therapy had the highest rate of revision surgery (9.0%), followed by patients who were treated with surgery alone (5.5%) and patients who received adjuvant irradiation (4.4%) (
P
= .085).
Trunk and head/neck tumors
Local control of high-grade soft tissue sarcomas of the trunk and the head and neck can be achieved with surgery in combination with radiation therapy.[
12
] Surgery without PORT may be possible in selected patients.  A case series was reported from a specialized sarcoma treatment referral center, in which 74 selected patients with primary extremity and trunk tumors 5 cm or smaller  were found to have no histological involvement of the surgical margins.[
3
]  These patients were observed without radiation therapy, and the estimated local recurrence rate after 10 years was 11%.[

Retroperitoneal tumors
Effective treatment of retroperitoneal sarcomas requires removal of all gross disease while sparing adjacent viscera not invaded by tumor. The prognosis for patients with high-grade retroperitoneal sarcomas is less favorable than for patients with tumors at other sites, partly because of the difficulty in completely resecting these tumors and the dose-limiting toxicity of high-dose radiation therapy on visceral organs.[
13
-
16
]
Local disease control is crucial in patients with retroperitoneal sarcomas. Disease-specific mortality caused by local recurrence (without synchronous metastasis) was reported in up to 77% of patients with retroperitoneal sarcomas compared with 9% of patients with extremity or trunk sarcomas.[
17
] An additional consideration in retroperitoneal sarcomas is the extent of surgery.
Evidence (extended surgical resection):
A series of 382 patients with retroperitoneal sarcoma in a multivariate analysis showed the following results:[
18
]
Patients treated with extended surgical resection had a 3.3-fold lower rate of local recurrence compared with patients who underwent simple complete resection.
Extended surgical resection was not associated with improved survival.
In a follow-up analysis, a 66% overall survival (OS) rate was observed  in the extended surgical resection cohort compared with a 48% OS rate in historic controls.[
19
]
An extended surgical approach has to be weighed against an increase in morbidity (resulting from surgical complications) and mortality.[
20
-
23
]
Metastatic disease
In the setting of distant metastasis, surgery may be associated with long-term disease-free survival  (DFS) in patients with pulmonary metastasis and optimal underlying disease biology.  This includes patients with a limited number of metastases and slow nodule growth  who have undergone or are undergoing complete resection of the primary tumor.[
24
-
26
]  It is not clear to what degree the favorable outcomes are attributable to the efficacy of surgery or the careful selection of patients based on factors that are associated with less-aggressive disease.
Radiation Therapy
A patterns-of-care study using SEER data was queried to identify patients undergoing surgery for trunk and extremity soft tissue sarcomas from 2004 to 2009.[
27
] Of 5,075 patients, 50% received radiation therapy. Radiation therapy was  not given as recommended in a significant portion of patients undergoing treatment for soft tissue sarcoma in the United States. Although routine radiation therapy is not recommended for patients with stage I disease, 25% of them still underwent radiation. Even though routine radiation therapy is recommended for patients with stage II and III tumors, only 60% of them underwent radiation. The multivariate analysis identified predictors of radiation therapy efficacy:[

Age younger than 50 years (odds ratio [OR], 1.57; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28–1.91).
Malignant fibrous histiocytoma histology (OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.3–1.92).
T2 disease (OR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.60–2.20).
High tumor grade (G3) (OR, 6.27; 95% CI, 5.10–7.72).
Patients with stage III soft tissue sarcoma who received radiation therapy showed improved disease-specific survival at 5 years, compared with those who did not receive radiation therapy (68% vs. 46%,
P
< .001).
Sometimes the initial management of soft tissue sarcoma cannot include surgical excision because the morbidity would be unacceptable, or nearby critical organs make complete resection impossible.  In such circumstances, radiation has been used as the primary therapy;[
28
]  however, this must be considered a treatment of last resort.  Experience of radiation as the primary therapy is limited to retrospective case series from single centers.[

Extremity and trunk tumors
Radiation plays an important role in limb-sparing therapy.  Pre- and postoperative radiation therapy has been shown to decrease the risk of local recurrence.  These techniques have not prolonged OS in prospective trials, but they are used to avoid amputation for all but the most locally advanced tumors or in limbs seriously compromised by vascular disease, where acceptable functional preservation is not possible.  In the case of external-bean radiation therapy (EBRT), irradiation of the entire limb circumference is avoided to preserve vascular and nerve structures that are critical to retain the function of the limb.
Evidence (PORT):
PORT has been tested in a single-institution randomized trial of 141 patients with extremity sarcomas who were treated with limb-sparing surgery.  Patients with high-grade tumors (n = 91) also received adjuvant chemotherapy (five 28-day cycles of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide).  Patients were randomly assigned to receive either radiation therapy (45 Gy to a wide field, plus a tumor-bed boost of 18 Gy over 6–7 weeks) concurrently with chemotherapy (in the case of high-grade tumors) or no radiation.[
29
][
Level of evidence B1
]
At up to 12 years of follow-up, there was one local recurrence in the 70 patients randomly assigned to receive radiation therapy versus 17 recurrences in the 71 control patients (
P
= .0001). There was a similar reduction in risk of local recurrence for both high- and low-grade tumors.
There was no difference in OS between the radiation therapy group and the control group.
Global quality of life was similar in the two groups, but the radiation therapy group had substantially worse functional deficits resulting from reduced strength, reduced joint motion, and increased edema.
To limit acute toxicity, smaller fields and lower doses of radiation are generally given with preRT than with PORT.   PreRT has been directly compared with PORT for extremity soft tissue sarcomas in a multicenter randomized trial, and no significant difference in local control or OS rates was found.[
30
-
32
]
Evidence (preRT vs. PORT):
Though designed to include 266 patients, a trial was stopped after 190 patients were accrued because wound complications in the preRT group had increased.  In the first phase of the trial, patients in the preRT group received wide-field radiation therapy of 50 Gy (in 2-Gy fractions). In the second phase of the trial, patients received  an additional 16 Gy to 20 Gy to the tumor bed and a 2-cm margin (only if tumor cells were found at the surgical margins). Patients in the PORT group received radiation therapy during both phases of the trial.[
30
-
32
]
The wound complication rates were 35% in the preRT group and 17% in the PORT group (
P
= .01).  In addition, limb function at 6 weeks after surgery was worse in the preRT group (
P
= .01).[
30
]
At 5 years, the two groups had similar local control rates (93% for the preRT  group vs. 92% for the PORT group) and OS rates (73% for the preRT  group vs. 67% for the PORT group;
P
= .48).[
31
]
Of the 129 patients evaluated for limb function at 21 to 27 months after surgery (n = 73 for preRT and n = 56 for PORT), limb function was similar in both groups, but there was a statistical trend for less fibrosis in the preRT group (
P
= .07).[
32
]
Brachytherapy has also been investigated as an adjuvant therapy for soft tissue sarcomas.  Although brachytherapy has the possible advantages of convenience and giving less radiation to normal surrounding tissue relative to EBRT, the two treatment strategies have not been directly compared in terms of efficacy or morbidity.  However, adjuvant brachytherapy has been compared with surgery without radiation.
Evidence (surgery followed by brachytherapy vs. surgery alone):
In a single-institution trial, 164 patients with sarcomas of the extremity or superficial trunk were randomly assigned during surgery (if all gross tumor could be excised) to receive an iridium Ir 192 implant delivering 42 Gy to 45 Gy over 4 to 6 days (78 patients) or to a control arm of no radiation  (86 patients).[

With a median follow-up of 76 months, the 5-year actuarial local recurrence rates were 18% in the brachytherapy arm and 31% in the control arm (
P
= .04).  This difference was limited to patients with high-grade tumors.
There was no discernible difference in sarcoma-specific survival rates between the brachytherapy arm (84%) and control arm (81%) (
P
= .65), and there was no difference in patients with high-grade tumors.
The rates of clinically important wound complications (e.g., the need for operative revision or repeated seroma drainage, wound separation, large hematomas, or purulent infection) were 24% in the brachytherapy arm and 14% in the control arm (
P
= .13). The wound reoperation rates were 10% in the brachytherapy arm  and 0% in the control arm  (
P
= .006).[
34
]
Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) has been used to deliver preRT or PORT to patients with extremity soft tissue sarcomas  to spare the femur, joints, and selected other normal tissues from the full prescription dose, and thus maintain local control while potentially reducing radiation therapy–related morbidity. Initial single-institution reports suggest that high rates of local control with some reduction in morbidity are possible with IMRT.[
35

Retrospective comparison of IMRT and  3-dimensional, conformal radiation therapy demonstrated that local recurrence for primary soft tissue sarcomas of the extremity was worse in the non-IMRT group.[

Retroperitoneal tumors
Retrospective data support the use of preRT or PORT versus surgery alone to treat retroperitoneal sarcomas.
Evidence (preRT or PORT vs. surgery alone):
Outcomes from  a total of 9,068 patients in two case-control studies conducted between 2003 and 2011 were analyzed.[
38
]
The 2,196 patients who received PORT were compared with 2,196 matched controls.
The median OS was 89 months for the patients in the PORT group versus 64 months for the patients who did not receive radiation therapy.
The 5-year survival rate was 60% for the patients in the PORT group and 52% for the patients who did not receive radiation therapy.
The 563 patients who  received preRT were compared with 1,126 matched controls.[
38
]
The median OS was 110 months for the patients who received preRT versus 66 months for the patients who did not receive radiation therapy.
The 5-year survival rate was 62% for the patients who received preRT versus 54% for the patients who did not receive radiation therapy.
Two small prospective studies explored the role of neoadjuvant radiation therapy in patients with intermediate- or high-grade retroperitoneal sarcomas. In a combined analysis of the 54 patients who underwent R0 resection (resection for cure or complete remission) or R1 resection (resection to microscopic residual tumor) after preRT, the following results were reported:[
39
]
The 5-year local relapse-free survival (RFS)  rate was 60%.
The 5-year DFS rate was 60%.
The 5-year OS rate was 61%. The median OS had not been reached (>60 months) at the time of the report.
Chemotherapy
Adjuvant chemotherapy for clinically localized tumors
The role of adjuvant chemotherapy remains controversial. Any potential benefits should be considered in the context of the short- and long-term toxicities of the chemotherapy regimen.
Several prospective, randomized trials were unable to determine conclusively whether doxorubicin-based adjuvant chemotherapy benefits adults with resectable soft tissue sarcomas. Most of these studies accrued small numbers of patients and did not demonstrate a metastasis-free survival or an OS benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.[
12
]  There was wide interstudy variability among the reported trials, including differences in therapeutic regimens, drug doses, sample sizes, tumor sites, and tumor histological grades.
Evidence (doxorubicin-based adjuvant chemotherapy):
A quantitative meta-analysis of updated data from 1,568 individual patients in 14 trials of doxorubicin-based adjuvant chemotherapy was reported. Only a small proportion of patients in this meta-analysis were treated with ifosfamide, an agent with demonstrated activity against soft tissue sarcoma.[

Level of evidence B1
]  The following results were reported:
An absolute benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy of 6% for local relapse-free interval (95% CI, 1%–10%), 10% for distant relapse-free interval (95% CI, 5%–15%), and 10% for RFS (95% CI, 5%–15%).
No statistically significant OS benefit at 10 years was detected; the absolute difference was 4% (95% CI, -1% to +9%).
A subset analysis suggested that patients with sarcomas of the extremities may have benefited from adjuvant chemotherapy, with a reported 7% absolute OS improvement at 10 years (hazard ratio [HR]
death
, 0.8;
P
= .029).[
41
]
Subsequent chemotherapy trials were performed using anthracycline and ifosfamide combinations in patients who primarily had extremity or trunk soft tissue sarcomas.  The data are conflicting.
Evidence (anthracycline and ifosfamide or cyclophosphamide combinations):
In a small feasibility study, 59 patients with high-risk soft tissue sarcomas (58 of whom had  an extremity or the trunk as the  primary site) underwent primary resection plus PORT. They were then randomly assigned to observation versus a dose-dense regimen of six 14-day cycles of ifosfamide,  dacarbazine (DTIC), and doxorubicin  (IFADIC regimen) with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)  bone marrow support.[
42
]
There were no statistically significant differences in OS or RFS. However, the study was severely underpowered.
In a second trial performed by the Italian National Council for Research, high-risk patients were treated with local therapy (wide resection plus preRT or PORT, or amputation as clinically necessary) and were then randomly assigned to observation versus five 21-day cycles of 4-epidoxorubicin (epirubicin) plus ifosfamide (with mesna and G-CSF).[
43
,
44
]
Based on power calculations, the planned study size was 190 patients, but the trial was stopped after 104 patients had been entered because an interim analysis revealed a statistically significant (
P
= .001) difference in DFS favoring the chemotherapy arm.  By the time of the initial peer-reviewed report of the study, the DFS still favored the chemotherapy arm (median DFS of 48 months vs. 16 months), but the
P
value had risen to .04.[
43
]
Although there was no difference in metastasis-free survival at the time of the report, there was an improvement in median OS (75 months for the chemotherapy arm vs. 46 months for the observation arm;
P
= .03).
At the follow-up report (median follow-up of 89.6 months in a  range of 56–119 months), OS differences were no longer statistically significant (58.5% in the chemotherapy arm  vs. 43.1% in the observation arm;
P
= .07).[
44
]
The DFS difference had also lost statistical significance (47.2% in the chemotherapy arm vs. 16.0% in the observation arm;
P
= .09).[
44
]
In summary, the trial was underpowered because it was stopped early, and the promising early results that led to stopping the trial diminished as the trial  matured.
In a third, underpowered, single-center trial, 88 patients with high-risk soft tissue sarcomas (64 with extremity or trunk primary tumors) underwent surgery (with or without radiation) and were then randomly assigned to receive four 21-day cycles of chemotherapy, epirubicin (n = 26) or epirubicin plus ifosfamide (n = 19), versus no adjuvant chemotherapy (n = 43).[
45
]  The trial was closed prematurely because of a slow accrual rate.
After a median follow-up of 94 months, the 5-year DFS rates were 69% in the chemotherapy arm and 44%  in the control arm  (
P
= .01).
The 5-year OS rates were 72% in the chemotherapy arm and  47%  in the control arm (
P
= .06).
All  the benefit associated with chemotherapy appeared restricted to the 19 patients  who received epirubicin plus ifosfamide.
In another underpowered trial, 134 patients with high-risk soft tissue sarcomas (93% with extremity or trunk primary tumors) were randomly assigned to undergo surgical resection (with or without radiation) or to receive three preoperative 21-day cycles of doxorubicin plus ifosfamide.[
46
]  This multicenter  trial from the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) (
EORTC-62874
) was closed because of slow accrual and results that were not promising enough to warrant continuation of the trial.
With a median follow-up of 7.3 years, the 5-year DFS rates were  52% in the surgery-alone arm  and 56% in the chemotherapy-plus-surgery arm  (
P
= .35).
The 5-year OS rates were  64% in the surgery-alone arm and 65% in the chemotherapy-plus-surgery arm (
P
= .22).
The previous four trials have been combined with the 14 first-generation trials in a trial-level meta-analysis.[
47
]   Of the 18 randomized trials of patients with resectable soft tissue sarcomas, 5 trials used a combination of doxorubicin (50–90 mg/m
2
per cycle) plus ifosfamide (1,500–5,000 mg/m

The absolute risk reduction in local recurrence rates associated with any chemotherapy added to local therapy was 4% (95% CI, 0%–7%), and it was 5% (95% CI, 1%–12%) when ifosfamide was combined with doxorubicin.
The absolute reduction in overall mortality was 6%  with any chemotherapy (95% CI, 2%–11%;  this was a reduction from 46% to 40%), 11%  for doxorubicin plus ifosfamide (95% CI, 3%–19%; this was a reduction from 41% to 30%), and 5%  for doxorubicin without ifosfamide.
An additional multicenter randomized trial (
EORTC-62931
[NCT00002641]) that used adjuvant doxorubicin (75 mg/m
2
) plus ifosfamide (5,000 mg/m

EORTC-62931
differed from those reported in the previous meta-analysis.[

The OS rate did not differ significantly between groups (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.68–1.31;
P

In a subsequent analysis of pooled individual patient data, the EORTC investigators combined data from this trial (
EORTC-62931
) with data from their previous trial (
EORTC-62771
) [

Large tumor size, high histological grade, and R1 resection emerged as independent adverse prognostic factors for RFS and OS.
Adjuvant chemotherapy was an independent favorable prognostic factor for RFS but not for OS.
Males and patients older than 40 years had a significantly better RFS in the treatment arms, while adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with a marginally worse OS in females and patients younger than 40 years.
The combined analysis showed no improvement in either RFS or OS associated with adjuvant chemotherapy.
In summary, the impact of adjuvant chemotherapy on survival is still controversial but is likely to be small in absolute magnitude.
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy
In prospective studies, neoadjuvant chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy has shown response rates of 17% to 32%, 10-year RFS rates of up to 58%,  and 10-year OS rates of up to 64%.[

Evidence (neoadjuvant histotype-tailored chemotherapy vs. standard chemotherapy):
The phase III
ISG-STS1001
study (NCT01710176) enrolled 164 patients with high-risk features (grade 3 tumor or grade 2 tumor with more than 50% necrosis, size ≥5 cm, deep location).[

Chemotherapy for advanced disease
Anthracyclines remain the first-line class of systemic therapy in managing most locally advanced and metastatic soft tissue sarcoma.[

Other regimens, approved for use as second-line therapy and beyond, include:
Gemcitabine/docetaxel.[

Taxanes or taxane combinations are used for patients with angiosarcomas.
The clinical benefit of  adding other drugs to the single-agent doxorubicin regimen is controversial.
In randomized studies, the combination of doxorubicin with ifosfamide has not demonstrated superiority over doxorubicin alone in terms of OS, but adding ifosfamide to doxorubicin may be considered in cases where reaching a better response to treatment, despite more toxicity, is the main treatment goal.[

Because
of the low metastatic potential of these tumors, chemotherapy is usually not
given to patients with stage I soft tissue sarcoma.[

Surgery
Low-grade soft tissue sarcomas have little metastatic potential,
but they have a tendency to  recur locally.  The treatment of choice for patients with early-stage sarcomas (tumors ≤5 cm in diameters) is surgical excision with negative tissue margins (of 1 cm to 2 cm or larger)  in all directions.[
3
-
10
]
The Mohs surgical technique may be considered as an alternative to wide
surgical excision for very rare, small, well-differentiated primary sarcomas of the skin when cosmetic results
are important, as margins can be assured with minimal
normal tissue removal.[
11
]
Surgery with radiation therapy
Surgical excision with preoperative radiation therapy (preRT) or postoperative radiation
therapy (PORT) may be indicated. Radiation therapy decreases the risk of local recurrence but has not been shown to increase overall survival.[
12
-
14
]
Options for tumors of the retroperitoneum, trunk, and head and neck include:
Surgical resection with the option of PORT if negative margins cannot be obtained.  Wide margins are unusual in these sites, and radiation therapy is usually
advocated for trunk and head and neck primary tumor sites.[
15
]
PreRT followed by maximal surgical
resection.  Radiation therapy may be used in sarcomas of the trunk and head and neck to maximize local
control when wide surgical margins cannot be obtained.[
16
]
High-dose radiation therapy
For unresectable tumors, higher doses of radiation therapy with curative intent may
be used.[
17
] Carefully executed high-dose radiation therapy using a shrinking-field technique may be beneficial in the following cases:[
18
]
Unresectable tumors.
Resectable
tumors with inadequate margins and a high likelihood of residual disease.
A wide resection
requires an amputation or the removal of a vital organ.

Surgery
Complete surgical resection (removal of  the entire gross tumor)
is the most important factor in preventing local recurrence and, in many
instances, requires resection of adjacent viscera. Surgical excision with negative tissue margins in all directions is generally restricted to low-grade tumors of the extremities (≤5 cm in diameter) or superficial trunk tumors with microscopically negative surgical margins.[
1
-
5
]
Complete surgical resection of retroperitoneal sarcomas is often difficult  because of their  large size at detection and anatomical
location.[
6
,
7
]  Local
recurrence is the most common cause of death in these patients.
Surgery with radiation therapy
High-grade localized soft tissue sarcomas have an increased potential for
local recurrence and metastasis.  For sarcomas of the extremities, local control comparable
to that obtained with amputation may be achieved with limb-sparing surgery that
involves wide local excision in combination with preoperative radiation therapy (preRT) or postoperative
radiation therapy (PORT).
Radiation decreases the risk of local recurrence but has not been shown to increase overall survival.[
8
-
11
]
A retrospective review that compared  surgery with or without preRT for retroperitoneal sarcomas suggested that the addition of preRT was  associated with improved local recurrence-free survival, but not disease-free survival.[
12
]
Radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy followed by surgery
In some situations, radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy
may be used before surgery   to convert a marginally resectable tumor to one
that can be adequately resected with limb preservation. This treatment may be
followed by PORT.
High-dose radiation therapy
For unresectable tumors, high-dose radiation therapy may be used, but
poor local control is likely to result.[

Chemotherapy
Doxorubicin has been the standard systemic therapy in managing metastatic soft tissue sarcoma for several decades.[
1
-

]   Other drugs that may  have clinical activity as single agents or in combination with doxorubicin are ifosfamide, other anthracyclines (epirubicin, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin), gemcitabine, trabectedin, eribulin, pazopanib, dacarbazine, and taxanes.[
4
-
10
] Despite improved response rates with anthracycline combinations, toxicity is markedly higher without an improvement in overall survival (OS) for patients with soft tissue sarcoma, with the exception of some specific subtypes.[
11
-
13
] Thus,  sequential use of single agents is the preferred strategy in most clinical settings.
A variety of other regimens have been used, but none have increased OS when compared with doxorubicin alone.[
1
,
2
]
There is some evidence that the addition of ifosfamide (with mesna) to doxorubicin increases response rates and progression-free survival (PFS), but it has not been shown to improve OS.[
11
] There is some evidence that the addition of trabectedin to doxorubicin improves PFS in patients with metastatic or unresectable leiomyosarcoma.[
12
,
13
]
Evidence (doxorubicin and ifosfamide vs. doxorubicin alone):
A randomized study (
NCT00061984
) assessed whether dose intensification of doxorubicin and ifosfamide improved the survival of patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma compared with doxorubicin alone.[
11
][
Level of evidence A1
]  In this study, patients were randomly assigned to receive doxorubicin (n = 228) or doxorubicin and ifosfamide (n = 227). The median follow-up was 56 months (interquartile range [IQR], 31–77 months) in the doxorubicin-only group and 59 months (IQR, 36–72 months) in the combination group.
There was no significant difference in OS between groups: the median OS was 12.8 months (95.5% confidence interval [CI], 10.5–14.3) in the doxorubicin-alone group versus 14.3 months (range, 12.5–16.5) in the doxorubicin and ifosfamide group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.83; 95.5% CI, 0.67–1.03; stratified log-rank test
P
= .076).
Median PFS was significantly higher for the doxorubicin and ifosfamide group (7.4 months; 95% CI, 6.6–8.3) than for the doxorubicin-alone group (4.6 months; range, 2.9–5.6 ) (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.60–0.90; stratified log-rank test
P
= .003).
More patients in the doxorubicin  and ifosfamide group  had an overall response (60  of 227 patients  [26%]) than did patients in the doxorubicin-alone group (31 of 228 patients [14%]) (
P
< .0006).
The most common grade 3 and 4 toxic effects were all more common with doxorubicin and ifosfamide (n = 224)  than with doxorubicin alone (n = 223), and included leukopenia (43% vs. 18%), neutropenia (42% vs. 37%), febrile neutropenia (46% vs. 13%), anemia (35% vs. 5%), and thrombocytopenia (33% vs. <1%).
Evidence (doxorubicin and trabectedin vs. doxorubicin alone in leiomyosarcoma):
A randomized, open-label, phase III trial (
LMS-04
[NCT02997358]) evaluated the combination  of doxorubicin and trabectedin compared with doxorubicin alone for treatment-naïve patients with metastatic and unresectable leiomyosarcoma. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either  doxorubicin (at a 20% dose reduction, or 60 mg/m
2
) with trabectedin (at a 27% dose reduction, or 1.1 mg/m
2
) for up to six cycles, followed by maintenance trabectedin (at the same dose) or doxorubicin alone (at a standard dose of 75 mg/m
2
)  for up to six cycles. Surgery was allowed in both arms for nonprogressive residual lesions after the completion of six cycles, if judged to be beneficial. A total of 150 patients were enrolled (67 with uterine leiomyosarcoma, 83 with soft tissue leiomyosarcoma); 74 patients received doxorubicin and trabectedin, and 76 patients received doxorubicin alone. The median follow-up was 55 months (IQR, 49–63 months).[
13
]
The median OS was significantly higher in the doxorubicin-plus-trabectedin group (33 months), compared with the doxorubicin-alone group (24 months) (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.44–0.95). The 24-month OS rate was 68% (95% CI, 57%–78%) in the combination group and 49% (95% CI, 38%–60%) in the doxorubicin-alone group.[
13
][
Level of evidence A1
]
The median PFS was significantly higher in the doxorubicin-plus-trabectedin group (12 months), compared with the doxorubicin-alone group (6 months) (HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.26–0.53). The 24-month PFS rate was 30% (95% CI, 21%–42%) in the combination group and 3% (95% CI, 1%–9%) in the doxorubicin-alone group.[
13
][
Level of evidence A1
]
There are some important caveats to consider:
Only patients in the doxorubicin-plus-trabectedin group without progression after six cycles were eligible to receive maintenance trabectedin. The median number of maintenance cycles of trabectedin received was 10.5. However, a total of 17 patients (23%) in the combination group did not receive maintenance therapy.
In the doxorubicin-alone group, 22% of patients had disease progression during the first six cycles. In the same group, 37% of patients received trabectedin as their second-line treatment, and 23% of patients received trabectedin as third-line therapy or beyond.
Surgery was performed in 20% of patients in the combination group and 8% of patients in the doxorubicin-alone group. This treatment could bias PFS and OS results.
Grade 3 and 4 adverse events, including neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and febrile neutropenia,  were more common in the doxorubicin-plus-trabectedin group (97%) than in the doxorubicin-alone group (56%) (
P
< .001). In addition, grade 3 and 4 liver toxicity was more common in the combination group (46%), compared with the doxorubicin-alone group (3%).
The combination of gemcitabine and docetaxel is used as second-line therapy in treating patients with soft tissue sarcoma. In selected cases, this combination may also be considered as first-line therapy.[
5
,
14
] Toxicity is increased with the use of combination chemotherapy. However, no quality-of-life studies have compared the use of single-agent therapy with combination therapy.
Evidence (gemcitabine and docetaxel vs. gemcitabine alone):
A randomized phase II study of 122 patients with soft tissue sarcoma reported the following results:[
5
][
Level of evidence B3
]
The objective response rate was 16%  in the gemcitabine and docetaxel group versus 8% in the gemcitabine-alone group.
Median PFS was 6.2 months in the gemcitabine and docetaxel group versus 3.0 months in the gemcitabine-alone group.
Median OS was 17.9 months in the gemcitabine and docetaxel group versus 11.5 months in the gemcitabine-alone group.
In a retrospective series of 133 patients, gemcitabine and docetaxel showed activity in patients with leiomyosarcoma as well  as other histologies with  an overall response rate of 18.4%.[
15
]
Evidence (gemcitabine and docetaxel vs. doxorubicin alone):
The GeDDis trial (
ISRCTN07742377
) randomly assigned 257 previously untreated patients to receive either gemcitabine and docetaxel or doxorubicin alone.[
14
]
The PFS  rate at 24 weeks (46% in both groups) and the primary end point (median PFS, 23.3 weeks vs. 23.7 weeks) were identical in both groups.
This study may have been limited by the relatively low dose of gemcitabine used (675 mg/m
2
on days 1 and 8 instead of 900 mg/m
2
as in previous trials).
Histology-specific targeted or immunotherapy treatment
Although doxorubicin alone has traditionally been considered the standard when comparing new drugs or regimens in the context of phase III clinical trials, some  sarcoma subtypes have shown higher sensitivity to specific agents.
Table 9
provides examples of specific agents that can be used as frontline treatment for specific subtypes.

Treatment of desmoid tumors
Evidence (nirogacestat vs. placebo):
A  phase III placebo-controlled trial (
NCT03785964
) included adults with progressing desmoid tumors who had either not received prior therapy or whose disease was refractory to prior therapy. Patients were stratified according to tumor location (intra-abdominal vs. extra-abdominal). Patients were randomly assigned to receive either oral nirogacestat (150 mg twice daily) or placebo (twice daily). A total of 142 patients were assigned (70 to the nirogacestat group and 72 to the placebo group) across 37 sites in the United States, Canada, and Europe. Thirty-seven patients in each group were women of childbearing potential. A total of 110 patients (77%) had previously undergone systemic therapy, radiation therapy, or surgery. The median follow-up was 15.9 months.[
28
]
The median PFS could not be estimated in the nirogacestat group (due to a low number of events) and was 15.1 months in the placebo group. The risk of disease progression or death was 71% lower in the nirogacestat group (HR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.15–0.55;
P
< .001).[
28
][
Level of evidence B1
]
The objective response rate was 41% in the nirogacestat group and 8% in the placebo group (
P
< .001). Complete responses occurred in 7% of patients in the nirogacestat group and 0% of patients in the placebo group.
Several patient-reported outcome measures were collected and assessed, including:
Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form.
GOunder/Desmoid Tumor Research Foundation DEsmoid Symptom/Impact Scale (GODDESS) (comprising the Desmoid Tumor Impact Scale physical functioning domain score and the Desmoid Tumor Symptom Scale).
European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) scales for global health status-quality of life, physical functioning, and role functioning.
Compared with patients in the placebo group, patients in the nirogacestat group had significantly improved scores across all assessments (
P
< .001).
Most (95%) adverse events were grade 1 or 2. The most common events (i.e., affecting >20% of patients) were diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, hypophosphatemia, maculopapular rash, stomatitis, headache, dermatitis acneiform, and vomiting.
Ovarian dysfunction (defined as amenorrhea, premature menopause, menopause, and ovarian failure) occurred in 27 of 36 women (75%) of childbearing potential. Of these 27 women, 20 (74%) had resolution of their adverse event, 5 (19%) had unresolved ovarian dysfunction, and 2 (7%) had an unknown resolution status.
Surgery
If the primary tumor is under control, resection of metastatic lung tumors may be associated with long-term disease-free survival in patients with optimal underlying disease biology, such as a limited number of metastases and slow tumor growth.[

Surgery with or without radiation therapy
Patients who develop a local recurrence can
often be treated with local therapy, such as  surgical  excision plus radiation
therapy (after previous minimal therapy) or amputation (after previous aggressive
treatment).[

][
Level of evidence C3
]   However, the contribution of selection factors, such as low tumor burden, slow tumor growth, and long disease-free interval, to these favorable outcomes is not known.
Chemotherapy and targeted therapy
Single-agent chemotherapy may be used with other single agents for disease recurrence.[
11
-
16
] Agents such as ifosfamide or gemcitabine may be used sequentially at the time of recurrence or progression.[
13

,
17
][
Level of evidence C3
]  However, as none of these agents have been shown to increase overall survival (OS) in this setting, clinical trials are an appropriate option.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved eribulin, trabectedin, and pazopanib for the treatment of soft tissue sarcomas after failure of a first-line chemotherapy regimen.
Eribulin
Eribulin is a microtubule inhibitor that the FDA approved in 2016 to treat patients with unresectable or metastatic liposarcoma, who previously received anthracycline-containing chemotherapy.
Evidence (eribulin):
The approval of eribulin was based on a phase III, multicenter, randomized study (
NCT01327885
) of 452 patients with advanced leiomyosarcoma or adipocytic sarcoma who received eribulin (1.4 mg/m
2
intravenously [IV] on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks) versus dacarbazine (850–1,200 mg/m
2
IV on day 1 every 3 weeks).[
18
]
Although the median OS was 13.5 months for patients who received eribulin versus 11.5 months for patients who received dacarbazine (hazard ratio [HR]
death
, 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.62–0.95), a preplanned subset analysis revealed a median survival of 15.6 months for eribulin versus 8.4 months for dacarbazine in patients with liposarcoma.
Median  progression-free survival (PFS) was the same in both groups (2.6 months).
Trabectedin
Trabectedin is an FDA-approved option for second-line treatment of patients with advanced liposarcoma and leiomyosarcoma.
Evidence (trabectedin):
The approval of trabectedin was based on a phase III randomized study (
NCT01343277
) of  518 patients who received   trabectedin (1.5 mg/m
2
over 24 hours on day 1 every 21 days) or dacarbazine (1,000 mg/m
2
on day 1 every 21 days).[
19
]
Treatment with trabectedin significantly improved median PFS (4.2 months for patients who received trabectedin vs. 1.5 months for patients who received dacarbazine).
OS, the primary end point, was not statistically different (12.4 months for patients who received trabectedin vs. 12.9 months for patients who received dacarbazine).
Response rates were low in both arms (10% for patients who received trabectedin vs. 7% for patients who received dacarbazine), but clinical benefit (that included both response rates and stable disease) was higher for the trabectedin group (34%)  than for  the dacarbazine group (19%).
The most common grade 3 and 4 adverse events in the trabectedin group were myelosuppression and transient elevation of liver function test results.
Phase II studies have shown a particularly high response rate to trabectedin in patients with myxoid/round cell liposarcoma, with overall response rates up to 51%, and a 6-month PFS rate of 88%.[

Pazopanib
Pazopanib is a multitargeted, oral, small molecule inhibitor of several tyrosine kinases, including vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1, -2, and -3; platelet-derived growth factor receptor  alpha and beta; and fibroblast growth factor receptor-1, and -3.
Evidence (pazopanib):
The phase III, randomized, double-blind
PALETTE
study (NCT00753688) from the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer compared pazopanib (800 mg daily) with placebo in 369 patients with different soft tissue sarcoma subtypes, excluding adipocytic sarcomas and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Patients were enrolled after disease progression on a first-line anthracycline-based regimen.[
21
]
The median PFS was 4.6 months for patients who received pazopanib versus 1.6 months for patients who received placebo.
The OS difference was not statistically significant. OS was 12.5 months for patients who received pazopanib versus 10.7 months for patients who received placebo (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.67–1.1).
Overall response rate was 6% for patients who received pazopanib versus 0% for patients who received placebo.
The stability of disease rate was 67% for patients who received pazopanib versus 38% for patients who received placebo.
The most common grade 3 or 4 toxicities in the pazopanib arm were fatigue, hypertension, diarrhea, anorexia, and transient elevation of liver function test results.
Based on these data, pazopanib was approved by the FDA in 2012 for the treatment of patients with soft tissue sarcomas (except the adipocytic subtypes) who have received previous chemotherapy.
After first-line chemotherapy, other agents can be considered, including:
Ifosfamide with or without etoposide.
Dacarbazine.
Temozolomide.
Vinorelbine.
Regorafenib.
Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy
Two trials have explored the immune checkpoint inhibitors pembrolizumab, nivolumab, and ipilimumab. Although some activity has been shown in selected soft tissue sarcoma subtypes, the  factors that may predict activity to treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors remain unknown, and their use cannot be routinely recommended.
Evidence (immune checkpoint inhibitors):
The phase II Sarcoma Alliance for Research through Collaboration trial (
SARC028
[NCT02301039]) studied treatment with pembrolizumab alone in patients with four soft tissue sarcoma subtypes: undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, synovial sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, and poorly differentiated or dedifferentiated liposarcoma.[
22
] Eighty patients were evaluable for response, with half of the patients in the soft tissue sarcoma group and half in the bone sarcoma cohort.
Responses were noted in the following subtypes:
Four of 10 patients with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma.
Two of 10 patients with poorly differentiated or dedifferentiated liposarcoma.
One of 10 patients with synovial sarcoma.
Zero of 10 patients with leiomyosarcoma.
The overall response rate was 18%.
The phase II
Alliance A091401
study (NCT02500797) randomly assigned  patients to receive nivolumab (n = 43) versus nivolumab and ipilimumab (n = 42) for the treatment of different soft tissue sarcomas.[
23
]
Two patients in the nivolumab group had an objective response (5%; one patient with alveolar soft-part sarcoma and one patient with leiomyosarcoma). Six patients in the combination group had an objective response (16%; two patients with leiomyosarcoma, one patient with myxofibrosarcoma, two patients with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, and one patient with angiosarcoma).
