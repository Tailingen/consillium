Zoledronic Acid Combined Radiotherapy for Bone Metastasis of Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This study will give comparison of the bone pain remission and the adverse reaction of Zoledronic acid combine with High dose fractionation radiotherapy(30Gy/10f) and Zoledronic acid combine with low dose fractionation radiotherapy(15Gy/5f) . The purpose of this trial is to prove whether Zoledronic acid combine radiotherapy can reduce radiotherapy dose in treatment of non-small cell lung cancer bone metastasis'pain relief or not.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer|Bone Metastasis
DRUG: Zoledronic acid|RADIATION: Radiotherapy
Percentage of Participants reach objective response, Objective response is defined as the patients bone pain relief reach PR(Partial remission) or CR(Complete remission).and Objective response rate is defined as Objective response patients'percentage in total patients.

Time evaluation points 1 month is the time after radiotherapy., Up to 1 month
Percentage of Participants occur bone pain recurrence at 1 to 12 month after radiotherapy., Bone pain Recurrence is defined as the time of the original parts again pain and the VAS is more than 4 points., every months up to the 12th month after treatment|Pain relief time in/after treatment, Pain relief time is defined as the time of the VAS(Visual analogue scale) score reduce 2 points or the analgesic reduce 25% after the radiotherapy Time evaluation points :when patients in treatment ,we shall evaluate pain scores everyday ; when patients after treatment,we shall evluate pain scores every month., everyday in treatment and every months up to 12 monthes|Incidence of SRE(Skeletal-related events) again in Participants, Incidence of SRE again is defined as the Participants occur SRE events after treatment.

Time evaluation points :When patients were after treat,we shall evaluate whether occur SRE again every month., every monthes up to the 12th month after treatment|Security of the therapy, Time evaluation points :when patients were in treatment ,we shall evaluate the toxicity everyday ; when patients were after treatment,we shall evluate toxicity every month.

Method：Using RTOG acute radiation injury grading assessment and RTOG / EORTC late radiation injury grading for radiotherapy toxicity，CTCAE V3.0 for Adverse drug reactions., everyday in treatment and every months up to the 12th month after treatment|Percentage of the osteogenic and the osteolytic sites reach objective response, every months up to the 12th month|Kaplan-Meier Estimates for Overall Survival after bone metastases, every months up to the 12th month after treatment
