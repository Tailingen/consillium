OCT Pilot in Esophagus
This is a pilot study to test a newly developed optical coherence tomography (OCT) device to determine 1) whether adequate tissue contact can be attained to acquire high quality images, and 2) to identify if these images can discern whether the imaged tissue is squamous or Barrett's Esophagus (BE) epithelium.
Barrett Esophagus
DEVICE: optical coherence tomography
Percentage of Imaged Sites Correctly Categorized as Squamous Mucosa, Percentage of imaged sites correctly categorized by OCT as squamous mucosa when compared to endoscopy., at baseline|Percentage of Imaged Sites Correctly Categorized as Barrett's Mucosa, Percentage of images site correctly categorized by OCT as Barrett's mucosa when compared to endoscopy., at baseline
