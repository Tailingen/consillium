Neo-adjuvant Pembrolizumab and Radiotherapy in Localised MSS Rectal Cancer
This project investigates the clinical and biological impact of combining immunotherapy (pembrolizumab) with short course radiotherapy (5Gy, five times) in the neo-adjuvant treatment of localised microsatellite stable (MSS) rectal cancer.
Rectum Cancer|Rectal Cancer
DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Tumour regression grade, To assess the tumour regression grade (TRG) after short course radiotherapy when given together with pembrolizumab, using the Mandard regression grade score, 12 weeks after start
Tolerability and safety, To assess tolerability and safety of pembrolizumab given with short course radiotherapy before surgery, using the common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) Version 4.0, 5 years|Overall Survival, To estimate overall survival (OS), defined as the time between the date of the study entry and the date of death due to any cause. Subjects who have not died at the time of last known follow-up will be censored., 5 years|Disease-free survival, To estimate disease-free survival (DFS), defined as the time between the date of the study entry and the date of recurrence, second primary cancer, or death without evidence of recurrence or second primary cancer., 3 years|Locoregional relapse-free survival, To estimate locoregional relapse-free survival (LRRFS), defined as the time between the date of the surgery and local or regional recurrence. LRRFS is evaluated in patients who had an R0 resection only, 5 years|Distant metastasis-free survival, To estimate distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), defined as the time between the date of the surgery and metastatic recurrence., 5 years|EORTC QLQ-C30, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer \[EORTC\] Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30, 30 months|EORTC QLQ-CR29, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer \[EORTC\] Quality of Life Questionnaire-CR29, 30 months
