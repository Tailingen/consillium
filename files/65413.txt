"Interference Pain" is the total score of 7 sub-scores, where each value may take any value from 0 to 10 (worst outcome). The range of the "Interference Score" can be from 0 to 70., Arm A: Screening, Day 1 of each cycle up to 9 months (Each cycle was 28 days in length); Arm B: Screening, Day 1 of each cycle up to 9 months (Each cycle was 21 days in length)|Change From Baseline in Average Pain in the Daily Activities Scales of the Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form (BPI-SF), "Worst pain" and "Average pain" are 'single question' scores from the BPI short form and may take any value from 0 to 10 (worst outcome).

It consists of 4 subscales (physical, emotional, functional and social/family well-being) plus a 12-item prostate-specific module, the PCS subscale, which highlights concerns specific to participants with prostate cancer. FAPSI-6 is defined as a symptom score made up of 6 items from within the FACT-P (pain \[n = 3\], fatigue \[n = 1\], weight loss \[n = 1\], and concerns about the condition getting worse \[n = 1\]). Each question in the FACT-P questionnaires has a choice of 5 responses, "Not at all", "A little bit", "Somewhat", "Quite a bit" and "Very much". The scores range from 0 ("Not at all") to 4 ("Very much") for positively phrased questions. Negatively phrased questions have a reverse scoring, from 0 ("Very much") to 4 ("Not at all"). This results in a consistent approach, where higher scores indicate a better quality of life., Arm A: Screening, Day 1 of each cycle up to 9 months (Each cycle was 28 days in length); Arm B: Screening, Day 1 of each cycle up to 9 months (Each cycle was 21 days in length)|Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Investigate the PK of AZD4635 when given in combination with durvalumab, and when given in combination with durvalumab plus cabazitaxel., Arm A:Cycle 1 to 3, and Cycle 4 onwards, and 90-day follow-up (FU) visit up to 14 months [Each cycle was 28 days in length];Arm B: Cycle 1 to 7 and Cycle 11 onwards, and 90-day FU up to 14 months (Cycle 1 to Cycle 10 = 21 days, Cycle 11 onwards = 28 days)|Terminal Half-life (t1/2λz), Investigated the PK of AZD4635 when given in combination with durvalumab, and when given in combination with durvalumab plus cabazitaxel., Arm A:Cycle 1 to 3, and Cycle 4 onwards, and 90-day follow-up (FU) visit up to 14 months [Each cycle was 28 days in length];Arm B: Cycle 1 to 7 and Cycle 11 onwards, and 90-day FU up to 14 months (Cycle 1 to Cycle 10 = 21 days, Cycle 11 onwards = 28 days)|Area Under the Plasma Concentration Time Curve From Zero to the Time of the Last Measurable Concentration (AUClast), Investigated the PK of AZD4635 when given in combination with durvalumab, and when given in combination with durvalumab plus cabazitaxel., Arm A:Cycle 1 to 3, and Cycle 4 onwards, and 90-day follow-up (FU) visit up to 14 months [Each cycle was 28 days in length];Arm B: Cycle 1 to 7 and Cycle 11 onwards, and 90-day FU up to 14 months (Cycle 1 to Cycle 10 = 21 days, Cycle 11 onwards = 28 days)|Area Under the Plasma Concentration Time Curve From Zero to 24 Hours [AUC(0-24)], Investigated the PK of AZD4635 when given in combination with durvalumab, and when given in combination with durvalumab plus cabazitaxel., Arm A:Cycle 1 to 3, and Cycle 4 onwards, and 90-day follow-up (FU) visit up to 14 months [Each cycle was 28 days in length];Arm B: Cycle 1 to 7 and Cycle 11 onwards, and 90-day FU up to 14 months (Cycle 1 to Cycle 10 = 21 days, Cycle 11 onwards = 28 days)|Area Under the Plasma Concentration Time Curve From Zero Extrapolated to Infinity (AUCinf), Investigated the PK of AZD4635 when given in combination with durvalumab, and when given in combination with durvalumab plus cabazitaxel., Arm A:Cycle 1 to 3, and Cycle 4 onwards, and 90-day follow-up (FU) visit up to 14 months [Each cycle was 28 days in length];Arm B: Cycle 1 to 7 and Cycle 11 onwards, and 90-day FU up to 14 months (Cycle 1 to Cycle 10 = 21 days, Cycle 11 onwards = 28 days)|Apparent Volume of Distribution During the Terminal Phase (Vz/F), Investigated the PK of AZD4635 when given in combination with durvalumab, and when given in combination with durvalumab plus cabazitaxel., Arm A:Cycle 1 to 3, and Cycle 4 onwards, and 90-day follow-up (FU) visit up to 14 months [Each cycle was 28 days in length];Arm B: Cycle 1 to 7 and Cycle 11 onwards, and 90-day FU up to 14 months (Cycle 1 to Cycle 10 = 21 days, Cycle 11 onwards = 28 days)|Number of Subjects With Serious and Non-serious Adverse Events, Safety and tolerability of each treatment regimen were assessed in participants with mCRPC., Arm A: From Screening up to 14 months (Each cycle was 28 days in length); Arm B: From Screening up to 14 months (Cycle 1 to Cycle 10 was 21 days in length, and Cycle 11 onwards was 28 days in length)
This is a Phase II, international, open-label, two-arm, non-randomised study of AZD4635 in participants with mCRPC. Participants in each arm will be stratified by the presence of measurable soft tissue metastasis (per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours \[RECIST v1.1\]) or bone-only metastasis (per Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 \[PCWG3 criteria\]). There will be no formal comparisons between treatment arms.

AZD4635 plus durvalumab (Arm A) will consist of 80 participants with mCRPC previously treated with one or more approved new hormonal agent(s) (NHAs) and one or more taxanes or participants who are taxane ineligible.

AZD4635 plus durvalumab plus cabazitaxel (Arm B) will consist of 80 participants mCRPC previously treated with docetaxel and one prior NHA.

As of November 2020, the Sponsor stopped enrolment in Arm A following decisions at the program level, not related to any safety issues. Ongoing participants in Arm A may continue treatment as planned.
