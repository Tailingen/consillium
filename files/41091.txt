Clinical Trial of Ac225-PSMA Radioligand Therapy of Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer
The death of prostate cancer patients is mainly due to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Though some new therapies has been tried to prolong the life-span of mCRPC patients, a dilemma was encountered for the drug-resistance. The PSMA RLT has been tested its efficacy and safety for the therapy of these patients. In our clinical trial, a new PSMA ligand will been used to be labeled with Ac225. This will be a prospective pilot clinical trial. 20 mCRPC patients who was incapable of 2rd ADT or chemotherapy will be recruited in this clinical tiral. The efficacy and safety of 225Ac-PSMA will be evaluated after the administration.
Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer
DRUG: 225Ac-PSMA
serum PSA level, Serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels was used as the main marker of efficacy evaluation, and the changes of PSA level were divided into decrease \> 50%, 30% \~ 50% and \< 30%., through study completion, an average of 1 year
Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events, Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events measured using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v5.0, through study completion, an average of 1 year.
