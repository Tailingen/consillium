The Clinical Application of 68Ga-NOTA-exendin-4 PET/CT in Detecting Insulinoma
The small insulinoma can not be detected by the CT or MRI. We use 68Ga-NOTA-exendin-4 positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) to detect the insulinoma for the patient diagnosed with endogenous hyperinsulinemic hypoglycaemia. And the diagnostic value will be performed. A single dose of 37-111 Mega-Becquerel (MBq) 68Ga-NOTA-exendin-4 will be injected intravenously. Visual and semiquantitative method will be used to assess the PET/CT images.
Insulinoma
DRUG: 68Ga-NOTA-exendin-4
Standard uptake value (SUV), Determination of SUV for detected lesions and discernible organs of 68Ga-NODAGA-JR11 and 68Ga-DOTATATE Standard uptake value (SUV) of the lesion will be recorded, From right after tracer injection to 1-hours post-injection
The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) is an emerging target due to its high expression in benign insulinomas. 68Ga-NOTA-exendin-4 is an optimal probe targeting GLP-1R. The clinical use of 68Ga-NOTA-exendin-4 PET/CT in detecting insulinomas will be evaluated. And the comparation between PET diagnostic value and CT / MRI will be done.
