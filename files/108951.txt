Preoperative Immunonutrition in Laparoscopic Total D2 Gastrectomy
Immunonutrition (IN) appears to reduce infective complications and in-hospital length of stay (LOS) after gastrointestinal surgery. More specifically, it seems to be beneficial also in gastric cancer surgery. Potential benefits of combining preoperative IN (PIN) with protocols of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) in reducing LOS in laparoscopic total gastrectomy are yet to be determined.
