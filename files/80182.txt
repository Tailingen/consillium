ELUCIDATE: Enabling Lung Cancer Identification Using Folate Receptor Targeting
This is a phase 3, multi-center, single dose, open-label, exploratory study in suspected lung cancer patients scheduled to undergo endoscopic or thoracic surgery per CT/PET/MRI or other imaging based on standard of care. This study aims to assess the efficacy of OTL38 and Near Infrared Imaging (NIR) at identifying pulmonary nodules within the operating theater, and to assess the safety and tolerability of single intravenous doses of OTL38.
Lung Neoplasms|Lung Cancer
DRUG: OTL38 for Injection|DEVICE: Near infrared camera imaging system
Clinically Significant Events (CSE), The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of patients who demonstrate at least one CSE as a result of utilizing OTL-38 and Near Infrared Imaging., 1 day|Localization of Primary Nodule, Proportion of FAS subjects with one or more primary NIR fluorescence positive lung nodules (cancerous or non-cancerous, excluding normal lung parenchyma) not detected under normal light and/or palpation, 1 day|Identification of Cancerous Synchronous Lesions, The proportion of FAS subjects with one or more NIR fluorescence positive cancerous synchronous lesions not detected under normal light and/or palpation, 1 day|Positive Resection Margins, The proportion of FAS subjects with the identification of a cancerous positive margin that fluoresces within (less than or equal to) 10 mm of the surgical resection staple line, 1 day
Sensitivity for Cancerous Primary Nodules and Synchronous Lesions in FAS Subjects, Sensitivity or True Positive Rate (TPR) for OTL38 used with fluorescent light in FAS subjects, defined as the proportion of fluorescent light positive primary nodules and synchronous lesions that are histologically confirmed to be cancer relative to the total number of primary nodules and synchronous lesions confirmed to be cancer., 1 day|False Positive Rate for Cancerous Primary Nodules and Synchronous Lesions in FAS Subjects, False Positive Rate (FPR) for OTL38 used with fluorescent light in FAS subjects, defined as the proportion of fluorescent light positive primary nodules and synchronous lesions that are histologically confirmed not to be cancer relative to the total number of fluorescent light positive primary nodules and synchronous lesions, 1 day
