Feasibility of Bright Light Therapy on Fatigue, Sleep and Circadian Activity Rhythms in Lung Cancer Survivors
The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of a morning bright light therapy intervention for fatigue, sleep disturbances, and circadian activity rhythms in lung cancer survivors.
Fatigue|Sleep Disturbance|Circadian Dysregulation
DEVICE: Morning bright light therapy|DEVICE: Dim light
Study Completion, The percentage of participants recruited that completed the study, Baseline
Changes in Quality of Life With theFunctional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Lung, Quality of Life will be assessed before, during, and after the intervention., 5 weeks|Assessment of Environmental Light With Actigraphy (Actiwatch Spectrum Respironics), Exposure to environmental light will be assessed at pre-test, intervention and post-test for a descriptive analysis, 5 weeks|Assessement of Chronotype With the Morningness Versus Eveningness Questionnaire, Chronotype will be assessed at baseline for a descriptive analysis., 1 day|Change in Fatigue Symptoms With Fatigue Severity Index From Pre-test to Post-test, Comparison of fatigue severity from pre-test to post-test., 5 weeks|Change in Sleep Quality With the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index From Pre-test to Post-test, Comparison of Sleep Quality from pre-test to post-test., 5 Weeks|Changes in Insomnia With Insomnia Severity Index From Pre-test to Post-test, Comparison of insomnia from pre-test to post-test., 5 weeks|Change in Circadian Activity Rhythms With Actigraphy From Pre-test to Post-test, Circadian Activity Rhythms will be assessed with actigraphy during the 5-week time frame., 5 weeks|Assessment of Visual Acuity With the Snellen Visual Acuity Chart, Visual acuity data will be collected and save for safety purposes only at pre-test and post-test., 5 weeks|Assessment of Daytime Sleepiness With the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Daytime Sleepiness will be assessed for safety purposes only at pre-test, intervention and post-test. Individuals with high daytime sleepiness and/or at risk of falling asleep while driving or performing hazardous activities will be referred out to primary care, 5 weeks
A randomized controlled trial to test the effects of morning bright light therapy on fatigue, sleep disturbances, and circadian activity rhythms in lung cancer survivors.
