Second-line Pazopanib Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) Study. CTRIAL-IE (ICORG) 10-01, V5
This is a phase II open label, single arm study evaluating treatment with pazopanib post sunitinib treatment in 43 patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Patients will receive 800mg pazopanib per day given continuously until disease progression. Patients must have received treatment with sunitinib and relapsed. Patient must have received prior treatment with sunitinib for at least 12 weeks. Prior treatment with either temsirolimus or everolimus in addition to sunitinib is allowed. The trial design uses a Simons two stage design with an interim analysis planned after the first 15 evaluable patients. If 8 or more of the first 15 evaluable patients remains disease free at 4 months, then a further 28 patients will be enrolled for a total of 43 metastatic renal cell cancer patients. It is estimated that there could be up to 10% of patients dropping out and so to achieve the required number of 43 evaluable patients the study will recruit up to 48 patients to ensure that 43 complete if stage 2 is required.

Patients will receive treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of patient consent. Response assessments will be carried out every 8 weeks until disease progression. Safety assessments will be carried out every 4 weeks (plus a visit for liver function tests after 2 weeks) for the first six months and then every eight weeks until disease progression. A further safety assessment will be carried out 4 weeks after treatment discontinuation.
