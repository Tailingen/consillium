Controlled Study of the Occurrence of Actinic Keratosis on the Face After Cryotherapy + Aminolevulinic Acid (ALA) Photodynamic Therapy
The purpose of this study is to determine if Levulan photodynamic therapy (PDT) is safe and effective in the treatment of actinic keratoses (AK) on the face, following treatment with liquid nitrogen cryotherapy.
