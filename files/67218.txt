Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics Study of QLH11906 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors Harboring MAPK Pathway Alterations.
This is an open label, phase 1 clinical study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of different doses of QLH11906 monotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic advanced solid tumors with abnormal MAPK pathway, and determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) or Maximum Administered Dose (MAD, if MTD cannot be determined) and Recommended Dose in Phase II Clinical Studies (Recommended Phase II Dose, RP2D).
