A Study of Azacitidine and Venetoclax Versus a Stem Cell Transplant in People 65 Years and Older With Acute Myeloid Leukemia
The researchers are doing this study to find out if an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) or maintenance therapy with azacitidine and venetoclax is more effective at keeping AML from coming back (relapsing).
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Azacitidine (AZA)|DRUG: Venetoclax|PROCEDURE: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
1-year Relapse free survival (RFS), Relapse free survival (RFS)- will be defined with patients being alive and without any evidence of disease. i.e. no morphologic relapse and no emergence of minimal residual disease. In the event of emergence of MRD without a morphologic relapse, this will be defined as relapse only if documented on 2 separate time points. For patients alive and in remission at the data cut-off, RFS will be censored at the last assessment date., 1 year
Overall survival (OS), will be defined with patients being alive and non-relapse mortality (NRM) will be defined as death in the absence of disease recurrence., 3 years
