DRUG: Topotecan|DRUG: Docetaxel
Determine maximum tolerated dose of drug combination
Response rates
Upon determination of eligibility, patients will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms:

For ever 2 patients treated, 1 will receive treatment A (Paclitaxel + Carboplatin + Gemcitabine) and 1 will receive treatment B (Gemcitabine + Vinorelbine). The study is not blinded so both the patient and the doctor will know which treatment has been assigned.

Upon determination of eligibility, patients will be receive:

* Docetaxel + Topotecan

In order to determine the most appropriate dosing regimen to progress into future phase II trials, two different dosing schedules of Topotecan and docetaxel will be utilized.
