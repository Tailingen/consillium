A Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Preliminary Efficacy of CC-90010 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors and Relapsed/Refractory Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas
Study CC-90010-ST-001 is an open-label, Phase 1a, dose escalation and expansion, First-in-human (FIH) clinical study of CC-90010 in subjects with advanced or unresectable solid tumors and relapsed and/or refractory advanced Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The dose escalation part (Part A) of the study will explore escalating oral doses of CC-90010 to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CC-90010. The expansion part (Part B) will further evaluate the safety and efficacy of CC-90010 administered at or below the MTD in the following cohorts:

Cohort 1: relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL approximately 20-25 evaluable subjects at 45 mg CC-90010 4-days-on/24-days-off in each 28-day cycle Cohort 2: advanced BCC -enrollment stopped due to recruitment challenges Cohort 3: relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL -approximately 15 evaluable subjects at 30mg CC-90010 3-dayson/11-days-offin each 28-day cycle.

The enrollment of subjects with R/R DLBCL in Cohort 1 and Cohort 3 was closed due to Company's strategic decision and not due to any safety concern or lack of preliminary antitumor efficacy.

The food effect assessment (Part C, Spain only) will evaluate the impact of food on CC-90010 when administered at the RP2D of 45 mg 4-days-on/24-days-off (180 mg per 28-day cycle), by comparison of the PK parameters following fasted and fed (high-fat, high-calorie meal) conditions.

Parts A, B and C will consist of 3 periods: Screening, Treatment and Follow-up.

Screening Period:

The Screening Period starts 28 days (± 3 days) prior to first dose of CC-90010. The informed document (ICD) must be signed and dated by the subject and the administering staff prior to the start of any other study procedures. All screening tests and procedures must be completed within the 28 days (±3 days) prior to the first dose of CC-90010.

Treatment Period:

During the Treatment Period, CC-90010 was initially administered orally once daily for 3 consecutive days followed by 4 consecutive days off drug every week (3/7-days schedule) in each 28-day cycle in Part A. Alternative dosing schedules (eg, 2-days-on/5-days- off each week, 3-days-on/4-days-off every other week, 4-days on/24 days off) may be evaluated one dosing schedule at a time or ≥ 2 dosing schedules given in parallel, based on the review of available safety, PK, pharmacodynamic (PD), and efficacy data by the SRC.

Following completion of dose escalation in Part A, selected expansion cohorts will receive CC-90010 in Part B. The SRC determined the RP2D for Part B to be 45 mg CC-90010 given once daily for 4 consecutive days on followed by 24 consecutive days off (4-days-on/24-days-off) in each 28-day cycle. There are 3 cohorts in Part B expansion. A cohort of up to approximately 20-25 subjects with relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL (Cohort 1) enrolled at the RP2D..

Enrollment in advanced BCC (Cohort 2) will be stopped due to recruitment challenges. An additional cohort of approximately 15 evaluable subjects with R/R DLBCL (Cohort 3) will be enrolled under an alternative dosing regimen of 30 mg CC-90010 3days-on/11-days off in each 28-day cycle. The enrollment of subjects with R/R DLBCL in Cohort 1 and Cohort 3 was closed due to Company's strategic decision and not due to any safety concern or lack of preliminary antitumor efficacy. The food effect assessment (Part C, Spain only) will evaluate the impact of food on CC-90010 when administered at the RP2D of 45 mg 4-days-on/24-days-off, by comparison of PK parameters following fasted and fed (high-fat, high-calorie meal) conditions in approximately 24 subjects with advanced solid tumors.

Follow-up Period:

In the Follow-up Period, subjects will be followed for 28 days (± 3 days) after the last dose of CC-90010 for safety.

After the Safety Follow-up visit, all subjects will be followed every subsequent 3 months (± 2 weeks) for survival follow-up for up until 2 years or until death, lost to follow-up, or the End of Trial, whichever occurs first.
