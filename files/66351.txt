Pulmonary Nodule Localization Prospective Validation
Localization is the key for successful excision of small target nodules under thoracoscopy, but the procedure also brings risks to patients. However, the criteria is still unclear. The investigators will validate the prediction model produced by institutional retrospective analysis in the prospective cohort.

PROCEDURE: Thoracoscopy
Nodule detection, Whether the nodule could be detected by conventional visualization or palpation, During surgery
Excision of targeted lung nodules during thoracoscopy sometimes needs placing a mark before surgery. The procedure of mark placement (localization) could probably cause damages to the patients. However, the criteria for patient selection is still not clear. Through respective analysis, the investigators have set up a prediction model and wish to validate this model prospectively.
