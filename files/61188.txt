The Safety and Efficacy Test of Immuncell-LC to Treat Refractory Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Immuncell-LC, the adoptive immuntherapeutic agent composed of a CIK cell agent, to treat patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, which are refractory to the 3rd-line chemotherapeutic agents.

All enrolled patients received the 12 times of Immuncell-LC therapy: 8 times in every 1 week and 4 times in every 2 weeks.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Immuncell-LC intravenous infusion using a CIK cell agent
the disease control rate (DCR), To evaluate the disease control rate (DCR) : complete reponse(CR), partial response(PR), stable disease(SD)., 4 months (17 weeks)
Stage IV colorectal cancer(CRC) has poor survival rate in spite of the development of chemotherapeutic agents. It is regarded as a standard palliative chemotherapy using with both targeted agents and cytototic chemotherpeutic agents. However, it is still demanding to treat stage IV CRC patients, who are refractory responses in these chemotherapeutics. In addition, patients were suffered from the various adverse events by the repetive cytotoxic chemotherapies.
