CXCR4 Modified Anti-BCMA CAR T Cells for Multiple Myeloma
Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable plasma cell cancer that almost all patients eventually relapse despite advancement in treatment strategies. B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) is a cell surface receptor that expressed primarily by malignant and normal plasma cells. This study aims to evaluate the safety and tolerance CXCR4 modified BCMA CAR T cells in treating standard treatment failed refractory/relapsed multiple myeloma, and will follow dose-escalating cohorts. The efficacy of CXCR4 modified BCMA CAR T will also be investigated.
