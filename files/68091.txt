Temozolomide for Relapsed Sensitive or Refractory Small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine whether treatment with temozolomide will shrink small cell lung cancer tumors. Temozolomide is an oral chemotherapy drug that is currently used to treat brain cancer and melanoma.

As part of this study, we will be doing additional tests that may help us understand how temozolomide works. First, if there is a tumor sample from a biopsy done in the past, it will be analyzed for an abnormal gene that may be present in lung cancer. Before starting temozolomide, a research blood test will be done to look for the same abnormal gene we are looking for in your tumor sample. Also, before starting temozolomide and every time you have a repeat CT scan, a research blood test will be done to analyze the number of tumor cells in your bloodstream.
Lung Cancer
DRUG: Temozolomide|DRUG: Temozolomide
The Objective Overall Response, The objective response is defined as all complete responses and partial responses based on the modified RECIST.Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD. Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions.

Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started., 2 years
