MMRF Molecular Profiling Protocol
This protocol is now being used as screening for the MyDRUG study
Multiple Myeloma|Plasma Malignancy
GENETIC: genetic sequencing
actionable mutations report, 10-14 days
Survival Rates, Overall survival|Disease Recurrence, Time to Progression
Here we propose an "integrative sequencing approach" utilizing a 1500 gene exome comparative analysis between multiple myeloma or related plasma cell malignancies and normal cells coupled to capture transcriptome sequencing to provide a nearly comprehensive landscape of the genetic alterations for the purpose of identifying informative and/or actionable mutations in patients with multiple myeloma and plasma cell malignancies. The approach will enable the detection of point mutations, insertions/deletions, gene fusions and rearrangements, amplifications/deletions, and outlier expressed genes among other classes of alterations.
