Effect of Oral Propranolol on mRNA Expresssion in Symptomatic Cavernous Malformation
This is a single center, randomized, trial that will enroll twenty (n=20) patients with a diagnosis of symptomatic cavernous malformations who are planned candidates for surgical resection by one of the investigators, and who meet all of the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients will be randomized into two groups: A Treatment group of ten (n=10) patients that will receive oral propranolol at a dose of 60mg per day (one 60mg ER capsule per day) for 7- to 10-days prior to surgery plus their usual medications, and a Control group of 10 (n=10) patients will receive only their routine medications. Currently, the only active treatment alternative for symptomatic cerebral cavernous malformations is surgery.

A control group is required to allow for a semi-quantitative comparison with mRNA and miRNA levels in the treatment group.
Cerebral Cavernous Malformations
DRUG: Propranolol|GENETIC: DNA and RNA Analysis
To measure effects of low-dose oral propranolol on global messenger RNA (mRNA) and microRNA (miRNA) expression in the blood and tissue of patients with CCM, compare changes noted in mRNA and miRNA in blood and CCM tissue samples of patients who do and do not receive propranolol preoperatively for CCM, -7 to -10 days until surgery
To correlate treatment response to propranolol with the underlying established mutations in cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM) genes., correlate and compare genetic mutations seen in CCM genes in tissue of patients who receive propranolol preoperatively, -7 to -10 days until surgery|Record adverse event (tolerance to) related to low-dose oral propranolol (60mg ER once daily), Number of reported adverse events in patients taking propranolol, -7 to -10 days until surgery
