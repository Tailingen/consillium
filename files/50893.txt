Fulvestrant, Palbociclib and Erdafitinib in ER+/HER2-/FGFR-amplified Metastatic Breast Cancer
This is an open-label, multi-institution, phase Ib trial that evaluates the safety and tolerability and preliminary anti-tumor activity of fulvestrant, palbociclib and erdafitinib in patients with ER+/HER2-/FGFR-amplified metastatic breast cancer.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Erdafitinib|DRUG: Palbociclib|DRUG: Fulvestrant
Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT) in the First Cycle for the Determination of the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), Number of participants with DLT in the first cycle for the determination of the MTD., From the time of randomization up to 4 weeks of treatment (cycle 1), for each patient
Progression-free Survival, Assessment of clinical impact \[anti-tumor effect\] of the combination of erdafitinib, palbociclib and fulvestrant in patients with ER+/ FGFR amplified metastatic breast cancer will be assessed by measuring the interval (in months) between treatment initiation and disease progression. Progression-free survival (PFS) time is defined as the time from treatment initiation to progression date or death (whichever comes first). Those alive without prpgression is censored at the last date of known alive. Median PFS time and 95% confidence intervals are obtained using Kaplan-meier method., Imaging studies will be performed every 8 weeks from date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 48 months|Overall Response Rate, Assessment of clinical impact \[anti-tumor effect\] of the combination of erdafitinib, palbociclib and fulvestrant in patients with ER+/ FGFR amplified metastatic breast cancer by measure the rate (%) of complete and partial responses seen in patients with measurable disease. The response of a patient will be evaluated using Solid Tumor Response Criteria RECIST v1.1., Imaging studies will be performed every 8 weeks from date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 48 months|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR; Complete Response + Partial Response + Stable Disease Without Disease Progression at 6 Months), Assessment of clinical impact \[anti-tumor effect\] of the combination of erdafitinib, palbociclib and fulvestrant in patients with ER+/ FGFR amplified metastatic breast cancer by measure the rate (%) of complete and partial responses + stability of disease at 6 months seen in patients with measurable disease. Response of a patient was evaluated using Solid Tumor Response Criteria -RECIST v1.1., From the time of randomization up to 6 months for each patient|Pharmacokinetic Assessment of Erdafitinib - Area Under the Curve (AUC), The area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to the last measurable concentration, From the time of randomization up to 4 weeks of treatment for each patient|Pharmacokinetic Assessment of Erdafitinib - Cmax (Maximum Plasma Concentration), The maximum (peak) observed plasma drug concentration after oral dose administration, From the time of randomization up to 4 weeks of treatment for each patient|Pharmacokinetic Assessment of Erdafitinib - Tmax, Time to reach maximum (Cmax) plasma drug concentration after oral dose administration (time), From the time of randomization up to 4 weeks of treatment for each patient|Pharmacokinetic Assessment of Erdafitinib - CL/F, Apparent total body clearance of drug from the plasma after oral administration, From the time of randomization up to 4 weeks of treatment for each patient|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events [Tolerability], Assessment of adverse events throughout the study. The number of patients who had any grade of adverse events were reported., From date of randomization until 28 days post treatment discontinuation from any cause, assessed up to 48 months
Serial Measurements of Serum Phosphate, Calcium, Vitamin D, Parathyroid Hormone (PTH), FGF23, sFGFR2, sFGFR3, and sFGFR4, Serial measurements of serum phosphate, calcium, vitamin D, PTH), FGF23, sFGFR2, sFGFR3, and sFGFR4 will be assessed to detect on target effects of FGFR inhibition (pharmacodynamic assessments)., During the first 8 weeks of treatment (days 1, 8, 15, 22 of cycle 1 and days 1 and 15 of cycle 2)|FGFR1 Amplification Levels by FISH and cfDNA, The level of FGFR1 amplification assessed in tumors by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) will be correlated with clinical outcome., At study entry (baseline)|Next Generation Sequencing, Will determine if other genomic alterations other than FGFR amplifications correlate with clinical outcome., At study entry (baseline)|Plasma Cell-free Deoxyribonucleic Acid (cfDNA), Will determine if the cfDNA results at disease progression show new genomic alterations potentially associated with resistance to CDK4/6 and FGFR inhibition., At study entry (baseline), at 4 weeks, and at study discontinuation from disease progression (for each patient), assessed up to 48 months.
Primary Objectives
