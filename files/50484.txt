Neoadjuvant Therapy for Esophageal Cancer and Cardiopulmonary Physiology
Although recent global trends indicate reduced postoperative mortality after esophagectomy, major morbidity, in particular pulmonary, remains high, with considerable health and economic costs. In a recent modern international collaborative series of 2704 patients from high-volume centers, with an approximate equal mix of open and minimally invasive approaches, respiratory complications were evident in 28% of patients, pneumonia in 15%, and respiratory failure in 7%.1 In other series, respiratory failure is reported in up to 15% of patients and is the most common cause of mortality. Prediction of risk and prevention of respiratory morbidity is therefore of considerable importance, and in this context baseline assessment of respiratory physiology compliments clinical assessment, history and enhanced recovery pathways representing key elements of current patient management.

In this study, which will include all prospective patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer treated at a National Center, pulmonary function will be systematically measured before and after neoadjuvant therapy. The investigators seek to evaluate the incidence of radiation induced lung injury (RILI), as well as subclinical changes in pulmonary physiology that may be linked to postoperative complications, and quality-of-life in survivorship, and to compare cohorts who received radiation therapy or chemotherapy alone, preoperatively.

Change in FEV1 following administration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy versus chemoradiation, Changes in FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in one second, litres), both as a raw value, and as percentage of predicted values normalized for ethnicity, sex, age and height according to Global Lung Function Initiative algorithms will be determined., 4-6 weeks post completion of neoadjuvant therapy|Change in FVC following administration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy versus chemoradiation, Changes in FVC (forced vital capacity, litres), both as a raw value, and as percentage of predicted values normalized for ethnicity, sex, age and height according to Global Lung Function Initiative algorithms will be determined., 4-6 weeks post completion of neoadjuvant therapy|Change in DLCO following administration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy versus chemoradiation, Changes in DLCO (pulmonary diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide, mmolÂ·min.-1.kPa. -1), both as a raw value, and as percentage of predicted values normalized for ethnicity, sex, age and height according to Global Lung Function Initiative algorithms will be determined., 4-6 weeks post completion of neoadjuvant therapy|Incidence of postoperative pulmonary morbidity as per Esophagectomy Complications Consensus Group (ECCG) definitions, Incidence of postoperative pulmonary morbidity, defined according to ECCG guidelines, will be compared after neoadjuvant chemotherapy versus chemoradiation., Up to 90 days postoperatively|Global health-related quality of life (HR-QL) score as assessed by Eastern Co-operative Oncology Group QLQ-C30 questionnaire, "Global health" HR-QL scores at one year postoperatively among disease-free patients will be compared between neoadjuvant chemotherapy and chemoradiation cohorts, One year postoperatively
Disease-free survival, Disease-free survival will be compared between neoadjuvant chemotherapy and chemoradiation groups using Kaplan-Meier methods, as well as multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusting for known prognostic factors., To date of study completion or date of disease recurrence, whichever occurs first, with a minimum of one year follow-up for all surviving patients|Overall survival, Disease-free survival will be compared between neoadjuvant chemotherapy and chemoradiation groups using Kaplan-Meier methods, as well as multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusting for known prognostic factors., To date of study completion or date of death, whichever occurs first, with a minimum of one year follow-up for all surviving patients
