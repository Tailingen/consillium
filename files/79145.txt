Intensity Modulated Total Marrow Irradiation in Fully Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-Matched and Partially-HLA Mismatched Allogeneic Transplantation Patients with High-Risk Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML), and Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)
The study is a Phase II clinical trial. Patients will receive intensity-modulated total marrow irradiation (TMI) at a dose of 9 Gray (Gy) with standard myeloablative fludarabine intravenous (IV) and targeted busulfan (FluBu4) conditioning prior to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis will include Cyclophosphamide on Day +3 and +4, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil.

Patients will receive the following conditioning regimen: fludarabine 40 mg/m2 IV piggyback daily, from day -5 (5 days before stem cell infusion) through Day -2, IV busulfan targeting a 4800 Î¼M/min/ day, from day -5 through day -2. In addition to the above chemotherapy, all patients will receive TMI at a dose of 3Gy on days -3, -2, and -1. On day 0, the stem cell product will be infused according to BMT (Bone Marrow Transplant) unit policy. Graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis will consist of the administration of Cyclophosphamide 50 mg/Kg on days 3 and 4 and mycophenolate mofetil combined with tacrolimus. Post-transplant evaluation will be done per standard care with study data collected at days 30, 60, 90, 180, 365, and 2 years.
