Assessment of Functional Digestive and Genitourinary Outcomes in Patients With Rectal Cancer.
Total mesorectal excision and neoadjuvant radio-chemotherapy have revolutionized the management of rectal cancer allowing an increase in survival (between 55 and 68% at 5 years) and allowing a decrease of local recurrence (under 10%) and allowing to push the limits of sphinctyer saving procedures.

Parallel to the oncological findings, evaluating quality of life and functionnals sequelae has become a priority as highlighted by the second axis of "plan cancer 2014-2019".

The prevalence of digestive functional sequelae decrease during the first two years after surgery. However, these results are difficult to analyse due to the heterogeneity of used scores in medical litterature. The low anterior resection syndrom associate poly-exoneration, gas and / or stool incontinence, urgency and stool splitting.

The score of low anterior resection " LARS score " validated in Danemark in 2012 allow us to understand the complexity of these sequelae and to measure their impact on the quality of life of patients, that's why he is currently recommended.

In the long term, almost two out of three patients suffer from this syndrom, with half of the patients in a severe form.

However, its prevalence and severity are often underestimated by practitioners. It leads to inappropriate therapeutic measures. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of digestive and genito-urinary sequelae on quality of life from validated scores in patients operated curatively of rectal cancer using a population study.

This study should include 676 patients with rectal cancer treated in calvados and alive at 2 years of their proctectomy without local or general recurrence.

assessment of digestive sequelae in patients operated for a rectal cancer (rectal resection), score used : LARS score (for men and women). 5 questions about the low anterior resection syndrom. Scale between 0 and 42 points. Better outcome is 0 and worse is 42., more than 2 years after rectal resection|assessment of global quality of life in patients operated for a rectal cancer (rectal resection), Score used : EORTC - QLQ C-30 - European Organization for research and treatment of cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (for men and women). It is a scale to evaluate the generic quality of life after cancer. There are 30 questions : 28 questions with 4 possible answers from 1 to 4 and 2 questions to evaluate the physical state and global quality of life with answers between 1 and 7. For each answer, 1 is the worst outcome and 4 is the best except for the 2 last questions where 7 is the best outcome. Minimum (worst outcome) is 30 and best outcome is 126. The total is reported to a score of 100 points which is the best outcome., more than 2 years after rectal resection|assessment of specific quality of life in patients operated for a rectal cancer (rectal resection), score used : EORTC - QLQ CR 29 European Organization for research and treatment of cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Colorecatl module 29 (for men and women). This score is used in patients undergoing treatment for colorectal cancer. There are 29 questions with 4 possible answers (between 1 and 4 points). Best outcome is 4 for each question. Worst outcome is 1 for each question. Minimum (worst outcome) is 29 and best outcome is 116. The total is reported to a score of 100 points which is the best outcome., more than 2 years after rectal resection|assessment of quality of life of patients operated for a rectal cancer (rectal resection) - urinary sequelae (for women), score used : Urinary Symptom Profile : USP (for women). This scale is used to evaluate urinary symptoms. 1 question to evaluate stress urinary incontinence (between 0 and 9 points). 9 points is the worts outcome. 7 questions to evaluate overactive bladder symtoms (between 0 points and 21). 21 points is the worst outcome. 3 questions to evaluate low stream symtoms (between 0 and 9 points). 9 points is the worst outcome.

Global score is between 0 and 39 points. 39 points is the worst outcome and 0 points the best outcome., more than 2 years after rectal resection|assessment of quality of life of patients operated for a rectal cancer (rectal resection) - urinary sequelae (for men), score used : International Prostate Score Symptom : IPSS (for men). There are 7 questions with 5 possible answers (between 0 (best outcome) and 5 (worst outcome)). And one additionnal question to evaluate quality of life due to urinary symptom with 7 possible answers from 0 (best outcome) to 6 (worst outcome). for the seven first questions : best outcome is 0 and worst outcome is 35. For the last question 0 is the best and 6 is the worst outcome)., more than 2 years after rectal resection|assessment of quality of life of patients operated for a rectal cancer (rectal resection) - Sexual sequelae (for women), score used : Female Sexual Functionnal index : FSFI (for women). 19 questions on sexual sequelae in this questionnaire.
