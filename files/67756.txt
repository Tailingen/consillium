Quality of Life and Economic Repercussions of Combining Proactive Medication Assessment and Electronic Monitoring of Toxicities in Subjects Undergoing Oral Cancer Therapy
Therapies used to treat cancer are administered orally (OT) in 75% of cases, lending themselves to outpatient care. This care pathway raises new issues: specific toxicities, drug interactions, and the relationship between the community (physicians and pharmacists) and the hospital.

Drug interactions can increase toxicities or decrease the effectiveness of treatment and impact overall survival. Detection of drug interactions before treatment initiation is not always performed in routine practice. However, these oral treatments have a low therapeutic index and are associated with side effects that can alter quality of life (QoL). They are classically documented by the physician at the time of the consultation using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), which makes it possible to adapt management. Nevertheless, numerous studies have shown a discrepancy between side effects reported by the patient versus those recorded by the physician, who tends to underestimate the intensity of the effects experienced by the patient.

Studies have shown an improvement in the overall survival and QoL of patients followed by electronic patient reported outcomes (ePRO) compared to patients followed conventionally.

Therefore, for this study, the study investigators aim to measure the impact of a care pathway associating a scheduled consultation with the hospital clinical pharmacist integrating a proactive medication assessment and the search for drug interactions and a follow-up of toxicities by ePROs on the QoL of patients treated with oral therapies in oncology and to estimate the economic impact.
