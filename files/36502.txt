A Study of MK-1484 as Monotherapy and in Combination With Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) In Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors (MK-1484-001)
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability and to establish a preliminary recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of MK-1484 administered as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in adults with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
BIOLOGICAL: MK-1484|BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab
Number of Participants with a Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) Graded Using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (AEs) Version 5.0, DLT is defined as any of the following toxicities, if assessed by the investigator to be related to study treatment: Grade (Gr) 4 nonhematologic toxicity (not laboratory); Gr 4 hematologic toxicity lasting ≥7 days, except thrombocytopenia: Gr 4 thrombocytopenia of any duration; Gr 3 thrombocytopenia associated with clinically significant bleeding; Gr 4 anemia regardless of duration; Nonhematologic AE Gr ≥3 in severity, with exceptions; Any Gr 3 or 4 nonhematologic laboratory abnormality if: clinically significant medical intervention is required, or if abnormality leads to hospitalization, persists for \>1 week or results in drug-induced liver injury with exceptions; Gr 3 or Gr 4 febrile neutropenia; Prolonged delay (\>2 weeks) in initiating Cycle 2 due to treatment-related toxicity; Treatment-related toxicity resulting in participant study treatment discontinuation during Cycle 1; Missing \>25% of the MK-1484 dose during Cycle 1 resulting from treatment-related AE; Gr 5 toxicity., Cycle 1 (Up to 21 days)|Number of Participants Who Experience At Least One AE, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study intervention. The number of participants who experienced an AE will be reported., Up to approximately 27 months|Number of Participants Who Discontinue Study Treatment Due to an AE, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study intervention. The number of participants who discontinued study treatment due to an AE will be reported., Up to approximately 24 months
Area Under the Curve (AUC) of MK-1484, Blood samples collected pre-dose and at multiple timepoints post-dose will be used to determine AUC., At designated time points (Up to approximately 24 months)|Minimum Serum Concentration (Cmin) of MK-1484, Blood samples collected pre-dose and at multiple timepoints post-dose will be used to determine Cmin., At designated time points (Up to approximately 24 months)|Maximum Serum Concentration (Cmax) of MK-1484, Blood samples collected pre-dose and at multiple timepoints post-dose will be used to determine Cmax., At designated time points (Up to approximately 24 months)
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability and to establish a preliminary recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of MK-1484 administered as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in adults with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
