AMG 102 and Avastin for Recurrent Malignant Glioma
The primary purpose of the study is to assess the response rate of AMG 102 and Avastin treatment in subjects with advanced malignant glioma. Secondary objectives are to estimate overall survival and 6-month progression-free survival rates in this population and to assess the safety of this combination in this population.

Patients must have recurrent histologically confirmed diagnosis of World Health Organization (WHO) grade IV malignant glioma (glioblastoma multiforme or gliosarcoma) with no more than 3 prior progressions. Subjects will receive Avastin and AMG 102 every two weeks. Avastin will be administered prior to AMG 102. Up to 36 adult subjects will take part in this study at Duke.

In initial Phase I and II clinical trials, four potential Avastin-associated safety issues were identified: hypertension, proteinuria, thromboembolic events, and hemorrhage. The most common side effect for AMG 102 have been nausea and fatigue.

Radiographic Response, The percentage of participants with a complete or partial response as determined by modified Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria will be determined. Complete Response (CR) is defined as complete disappearance on MR/CT of all enhancing tumor and mass effect, off all corticosteroids (or receiving only adrenal replacement doses) and accompanied by a stable or improving neurologic examination. Partial Response (PR) is defined as greater than or equal to 50% reduction in tumor size on MR/CT by bi-dimensional measurement, on a stable or decreasing dose of corticosteroids and accompanied by a stable or improving neurologic examination. Tumor assessments are done at baseline and the end of every 6-week cycle thereafter., 2 years
Median Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the time in months from the start of protocol treatment until the date of death, or the date of last follow-up if alive. Kaplan-Meier methods will be used to estimate overall survival., 2 years|Six-month Progression-free Survival (PFS6), The percentage of participants alive and progression-free at 6 months after the start of study treatment will be determined. PFS6 will be calculated from the date study treatment started until the date of progression or death, or the date of last follow-up if participants are alive without progression. Kaplan-Meier methods will be used to estimate survival., 6 months|Percentage of Participants Who Experience Treatment-related Grade 2 or Greater CNS Hemorrhage or Grade 4 or Greater Non-hematologic Toxicities, The percentage of participants who experience unacceptable toxicity, defined as any treatment-related grade 2 or greater CNS hemorrhage or grade 4 or greater non-hematologic toxicity, will be calculated., 2 years
