Performance Evaluation of the Micromedic CD24 in Vitro Diagnostic Assay
This study is aimed to evaluate the performance of the Micromedic CD24 assay in identifying colorectal adenoma using Western blot and ELISA assays. These assays are designed to detect CD24 protein in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL). Elevated levels of CD24 may be indicative of colorectal adenoma (inclusive of optically detectable early adenoma to late adenoma, and cancer).
