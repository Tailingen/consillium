Jinfukang Oral Liquid Combined With Chemotherapy for Treating Driver Gene-negative Advanced NSCLC
This is a prospective, randomized, multicenter real-world study, which aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of Jinfukang oral liquid combined with chemotherapy as first-line treatment regimen for patients with driver-negative advanced NSCLC. 328 patients with unresectable stage IIIB-IV NSCLC and Qi-Yin deficiency will be divided into experimental (n=164) and control groups (n=164) according to the stratified blocked randomization.
