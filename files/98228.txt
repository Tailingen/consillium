Nivolumab and the Antagonistic CSF-1R Monoclonal Antibody Cabiralizumab (BMS-986227) in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Peripheral T Cell Lymphoma
A multicenter trial evaluating the combination of nivolumab and the antagonistic CSF-1R monoclonal antibody cabiralizumab (BMS-986227) in patients with relapsed/refractory peripheral T cell lymphoma
Peripheral T Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: cabiralizumab
Overall Response Rate (ORR) at Four Months (LYRIC Criteria), Overall Response Rate (CR + PR) as determined by LYRIC (LYmphoma Response to Immunomodulatory therapy Criteria), at four months (shown as number of participants with CR or PR at 4 months).

LYRIC: An adaptation of the Lugano classification developed because discriminating true progressive disease from pseudoprogression in lymphoma patients receiving immunomodulatory agents is challenging. To address this challenge, the LYRIC criteria incorporated the response category of "indeterminate response" (IR).

* IR(1): ≥ 50% increase in overall tumor burden (sum of the product of the perpendicular diameters (SPD) of up to 6 target measurable nodes and extranodal sites) occurred in the 1st 12 weeks of therapy and without clinical deterioration
* IR(2): new lesions or ≥ 50% increase of existing lesion(s) without a ≥ 50% increase of overall tumor burden at any time during treatment.
* IR(3): increased FDG uptake of 1or more lesions without any increase in size or number of those lesions., 4 months|Complete Response Rate (CRR) at Four Months, Complete response rate, as determined by LYRIC criteria, at four months (reported as number of participants with CR at 4 months).

Overall Response at Four Months by (LUGANO 2014) Criteria, Overall response (CR + PR), as determined by LUGANO 2014 criteria (reported as number of participants with a CR or PR at 4 months).

The Lugano classification is utilized for both lymphoma staging and response assessment and incorporates PET-CT imaging. Responses are described as either partial or complete, with a complete response requiring disappearance of metabolically active sites of disease., four months|Complete Response Rate at Four Months (LUGANO 2014) Criteria, Complete Response Rate, as determined by LUGANO 2014 criteria, at (reported as number of participants with a CR at 4 months).

The Lugano classification is utilized for both lymphoma staging and response assessment and incorporates PET-CT imaging. A complete response requires disappearance of metabolically active sites of disease., four months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Progression-Free Survival will be measured from date of enrollment until the criteria for disease progression (PD) is met or death occurs. Subjects who have not progressed will be right-censored at the date of the last disease evaluation., Up to one year post treatment discontinuation or an estimated maximum of 60 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), The proportion of all subjects with stable disease (SD) for 8 weeks, PR, or CR., Up to one year post treatment discontinuation or an estimated maximum of 60 months|Duration of Response (DOR), Duration of Response measured from the time that measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever status is recorded first) until the date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since treatment started)., Up to one year post treatment discontinuation or an estimated maximum of 60 months|Time to Next Treatment (TNT), Time to next treatment (TNT) is defined as the time from the date of enrollment to the institution of next treatment., Up to one year post treatment discontinuation or an estimated maximum of 60 months|Summarize Adverse Events, Assess and summarize adverse events (AEs) using NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5., Up to 100 days post treatment discontinuation or an estimated maximum of 60 months
Enrollment to this study was discontinued after four subjects due to industry-related changes to the Cabiralizumab program.
