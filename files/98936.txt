BIOLOGICAL: Suicide plus immunogene therapy
Safety reported as the number of treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.03, Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.03 (https://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010-06-14_QuickReference_5x7.pdf)., 1 year
This phase I clinical protocol is proposed to evaluate the safety of combined immunotherapy genetics in humans.

This treatment combines the high local cytotoxicity of the suicide gene system (HSV thymidine kinase: HSVt k) / prodrug (ganciclovir: GCV) with the immunostimulation of interleukin2 (hIL2) and immunoamplification of granulocyte and macrophage colony stimulating factor (hGMCSF) in the presence of tumor antigens.

The proposed scheme consists in the periodic intra / peritumoral application of plasmid DNA complexes: cationic lipid (lipoplexes) containing the HSVtk gene, co-administered with the prodrug GCV, and subcutaneous injections of a vaccine (LGvax) produced with formolized extracts of allogeneic melanoma combined with lipoplexes carrying the hIL2 and hGMCSF genes.
