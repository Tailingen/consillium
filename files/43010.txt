Trial Comparing Two Protocols of re Irradiation in an Irradiated Area for Carcinoma of the Upper Aerodigestive Tract
Patients will be randomised after surgery, provided surgery is macroscopically adequate, that there is a flap of tissue protecting the vascular axis and that wound healing allows reirradiation to begin less than 8 weeks after surgery.Reirradiation will begin in the two arms less than 8 weeks after surgery in the irradiated area. The reirradiated volume : tumour bed + a safety margin of \< 2 cm with immediate protection of bone marrow. This volume should be jointly defined by the radiotherapist and the surgeon. During reirradiation, 60 Gy will be delivered in the two arms but will last 11 weeks in the reference arm and 5 weeks in the investigational arm.Acute toxicity (NCI-CTCAE) will be evaluated at the end of reirradiation and at 6 months from randomization (first follow-up consultation)
Squamous Cell Carcinoma
RADIATION: single-fraction radiotherapy with concomitant 5FU and Hydrea|RADIATION: hyperfractionated radiotherapy with concomitant Cetuximab
Acute toxicity requiring an interruption of radiotherapy for more than 2 weeks, 6 months|Overall survival at 3 years and loco-regional control at 3 years, 3 years
