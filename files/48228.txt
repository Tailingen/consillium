Extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTCL), nasal type, is a rare subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) with relatively high incidence in China. L-asparaginase based chemotherapy improved overall response and prolonged the long-term survival for patients with stage IV. But the treatment for the patients with advanced disease and resistant to L-asparaginase based chemotherapy has not been established. The overall survival for these patients are very poor. This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of anlotinib in patients with stage IV ENKTCL and refractory to L-asparaginase based chemotherapy.
