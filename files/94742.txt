Platform Study for the Treatment of Relapsed or Refractory Aggressive Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (PRISM Study)
This is a Phase 1 platform protocol designed to evaluate various targeted agents for the treatment of relapsed/refractory aggressive Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL).

Safety of the study treatments when given in combination [Incidence of adverse events], Incidence of adverse events, Through to study completion, an average of 1 year
Assessment of the efficacy of each treatment by evaluation of overall response rate using RECIL 2017 response criteria, The overall response rate (ORR) is defined as the rate of subjects who achieve either a partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) as assessed by investigators before receiving any other anticancer therapy., Through to study completion, an average of 1 year|Duration of response (DOR) using RECIL 2017 response criteria for the anti-tumour activity of each therapy., Duration of Response (DOR) is defined as the time from the first objective response of CR or PR to the time of documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Through to study completion, an average of 1 year|Progression free survival (PFS) using RECIL 2017 response criteria for the anti-tumour activity of each therapy., Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from first dose date to documented objective disease progression, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Disease progression will be determined by the investigators per standard response criteria as outlined in each respective study arm., Through to study completion, an average of 1 year|Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from first dose until the date of death from any cause., From the beginning of treatment until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 12 months|Peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of Study Drug A (Arm 1), Samples will be collected predose and 1, 4, 6 hours postdose on Cycle 1 Day 8 only; then predose and approximately 1 hr (end of infusion of Study Drug A) on Day 1 of every odd cycle starting with Cycle 3 through study completion, an average of 1 year|Peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of Study Drug B (Arm 2), Samples will be collected predose and 1, 4, 8 hours postdose on Cycle 1 Day 8 only; then predose on Cycle 2 Day 1 and Cycle 3 Day 1|Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) of Study Drug A (Arm 1), Samples will be collected predose and 1, 4, 6 hours postdose on Cycle 1 Day 8 only; then predose and approximately 1 hr (end of infusion of Study Drug A) on Day 1 of every odd cycle starting with Cycle 3 through study completion, an average of 1 year|Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) of Study Drug B (Arm 2), Samples will be collected predose and 1, 4, 8 hours postdose on Cycle 1 Day 8 only; then predose on Cycle 2 Day 1 and Cycle 3 Day 1|Presence of Anti-Drug Antibody (ADA) titres in subjects treated with Study Drug A, Samples will be collected predose on Days 1 and 8 of Cycle 1 and predose on Day 1 of every odd cycle starting with Cycle 3|Peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of acalabrutinib (Arm 1), Samples will be collected predose and 1, 4, 6 hours postdose on Cycle 1 Day 8 only|Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) for acalabrutinib (Arm 1), Samples will be collected predose and 1, 4, 6 hours postdose on Cycle 1 Day 8 only|Peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of acalabrutinib (Arm 2), Samples will be collected predose and 1, 4, 8 hours postdose on Cycle 1 Day 8 only; then predose on Cycle 2 Day 1 and Cycle 3 Day 1|Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) for acalabrutinib (Arm 2), Samples will be collected predose and 1, 4, 8 hours postdose on Cycle 1 Day 8 only; then predose on Cycle 2 Day 1 and Cycle 3 Day 1
This is a Phase 1 platform protocol designed to evaluate various targeted agents for the treatment of relapsed/refractory aggressive Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Each study arm will be conducted in a predefined disease subset. All study arms are open label and allocation to each study arm will not be randomized.

As this master platform protocol has multiple study arms, subjects can be screened for several study arms at once. Likewise, a subject who ends participation in one study arm may be rescreened for participation in another (separate) study arm.

The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of targeted agents for the treatment of relapsed/refractory aggressive Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL). This protocol has a modular design, with the potential for future treatment arms to be added via protocol amendment.
