OPTImaL:Optimisation of Treatment for Patients With Low Stage Triple-negative Breast Cancer With High Stromal Tumor-infiltrating Lymphocytes
The aim of this study is to investigate whether subjects with breast cancer that have certain favorable features, after performing the surgery and radiation, the chemotherapy can be safely omitted in the treatment. In addition, the investigation looks at whether the omission of chemotherapy ensures a better quality of life. Participants decide, in consultation with their treating physician, whether they choose to be treated with adjuvant chemotherapy or not.
