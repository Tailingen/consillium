This is an open label, safety and preliminary efficacy study of MRx0518 in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with solid tumours (non small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, bladder cancer or melanoma).

Subjects will be treated with IV pembrolizumab every 3 weeks and 1 capsule twice daily of MRx0518. Treatment will continue as long as clinically relevant, until disease progression, unacceptable AEs or withdrawal of consent up to a maximum of 35 cycles (approx. 2 years).
