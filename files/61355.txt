Determinants of Acquired Endocrine Resistance in Metastatic Breast Cancer: A Pilot Study
This is a single-center prospective study involving analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and the gut microbiome in patients with metastatic breast cancer on standard of care endocrine therapy with an aromatase inhibitor in combination with an inhibitor of the cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK 4/6). Up to 20 patients with Estrogen Receptor positive (ER+), Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 negative (HER2-) metastatic breast cancer and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1 will be enrolled. This study involves the collection and analysis of patient samples and does not involve therapeutic intervention.

Endocrine therapies have been associated with an overall survival benefit in breast cancer and are the preferred initial treatment approach in patients with ER+, HER2- metastatic breast cancer. Unfortunately, resistance to endocrine therapies eventually develops in the metastatic setting and metastatic breast cancer remains an incurable disease. Endocrine resistance may develop as a result of alterations in estrogen signaling and metabolism pathways, which may be modulated by gut bacteria. In addition, genomic profiling of archival tissues and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in ER+ breast cancer has identified multiple somatic molecular alterations that may mediate response to endocrine therapies.

This study is designed to identify markers of endocrine resistance in ctDNA and the gut microbiome in patients with ER+ HER2- metastatic breast cancer.
