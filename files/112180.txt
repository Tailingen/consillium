Study of BN83495 in Post-menopausal Women With Endometrial Cancer Post-chemotherapy
The purpose of the protocol is to determine the effect of BN83495 on the progression of endometrial cancer with estrogen receptor in post menopausal women who had previously received chemotherapy.
Endometrial Cancer
DRUG: BN83495
Determination of Clinical Benefit (CB), Defined as Sum of Patients Who Present Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR) or Stable Disease (SD) ≥12 Weeks (CB=CR+PR+SD≥12 Weeks) Using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST Version1.1), CR defined as: Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm.

PR defined as: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.

SD defined as: Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for Progressive Disease (PD), taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.

PD defined as: At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression)., 12 weeks
Number of Participants With Adverse Events, Up to 28 days after last dose|Determination of Time to Progression (TTP) in This Patient Population, Time to Progression (TTP): Time from first study treatment to first documentation of objective tumour progression., After the last enrolled patient has been followed for at least 6 months or has progressed or died|Determination of Progression Free Survival (PFS) in This Patient Population, Progression Free Survival (PFS): Time from first study treatment until objective tumour progression or death from any cause., After the last enrolled patient has been followed for at least 6 months or has progressed or died|Determination of Overall Response Rate (ORR) in This Patient Population, Overall Response Rate (ORR): Defined as the sum of CR and PR., After the last enrolled patient has been followed for at least 6 months or has progressed or died|Determination of Duration of Response in This Patient Population, Duration of Response (DR): Time from the first documentation of objective tumour response (defined as CR or PR) to the first documentation of objective tumour progression or death on study due to any cause., After the last enrolled patient has been followed for at least 6 months or has progressed or died|Determination of Overall Survival in This Patient Population, Overall Survival (OS): Defined as the time from first study treatment to death due to any cause., 2 years after the last patient enrolled
