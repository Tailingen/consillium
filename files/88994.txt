Wedge Resection for Ground-glass Opacity-featured Lung Cancer (ECTOP-1020)
This is a clinical trial from the Eastern Cooperative Thoracic Oncology Project (ECTOP), numbered as ECTOP-1020. The goal of this clinical trial is to confirm the therapeutic effect of Wedge resection for ground-glass opacity-featured lung cancer with a size less than 2cm and a consolidation-to-tumor ratio between 0.25 to 0.5.
