Conversion of Tislelizumab Combined With Chemotherapy in Unresectable Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
Whether the introduction of immunotherapy can transform unresectable esophageal cancer into resectable, or even achieve R0 surgical resection, has not been reported yet. We plan to conduct a prospective, single-center, single-arm phase II clinical study of the safety and efficacy of tislelizumab combined with chemotherapy in the treatment of unresectable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

Evaluate the rate of pathologic complete response (pCR) to the study regimen, The percentage of pathologic complete response at resection for patients who has completed the study regimen, 1 year|Evaluate the rate of main pathologic response (MPR) to the study regimen., Viable tumor comprised â‰¤ 10% of resected tumor specimens, 1 year|Objective response rate (ORR), Partial response is defined as a decrease by 30% or more in sums of longest diameter of measurable target lesions, 1 year|Disease-free survival (DFS), DFS is defined as the time interval between the date of enrollment and the date of the first documented evidence of relapse after radical resection at any site or death related to cancer, 3 years|Overall survival (OS), Time from the enrollment to death of any cause, 3 years
For patients not eligible for R0 resection (defined as locally advanced unresectable esophageal cancer), preoperative treatment can theoretically transform the tumor into a resectable state. The current significance of transformation therapy is to reduce tumor volume and stage to achieve radical resection, eliminate micrometastases, and prevent a postoperative recurrence. There are few studies on the transformation therapy of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. We plan to conduct a prospective, single-center, single-arm phase II clinical study of the safety and efficacy of tislelizumab combined with chemotherapy in the treatment of T4a/N3 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
