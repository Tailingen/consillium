Neoadjuvant PD-1 Monoclonal Antibody Plus Cisplatin-based Chemotherapy in Locally Advanced Upper Tract Urothelial Carcinoma
This study is designed prospectively to investigate the safety and efficacy of neoadjuvant PD-1 monoclonal antibody combined with cisplatin-based chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC). Tislelizumab, an anti-programmed death protein-1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibody, was engineered to minimize binding to FcÎ³R on macrophages to abrogate antibody-dependent phagocytosis, a mechanism of T-cell clearance and potential resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy. The safety, tolerability, and efficacy of tislelizumab in patients with PD-L1 positive urothelial carcinoma who progressed during/following platinum-containing therapy was proved in a phase 2 trial (CTR20170071). This trial focuses on the efficacy of Tislelizumab in combination with cisplatin-based chemotherapy to induce pathological down-staging of locally advanced UTUC in neoadjuvant setting.
Neoadjuvant Therapy of Locally Advanced Upper Urinary Tract Urothelial Carcinoma
DRUG: Immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy
Pathological complete response rate, the absence of visible lesion of carcinoma (ypT0/Tis) and the absence of microscopic lymph node metastases (ypN0) on the final surgical specimen, 30 days after surgery
Pathologic response rate, The rate of patients that reach pathological downstaging at the time of nephroureterectomy., 30 days after surgery
Neoadjuvant therapy of cisplatin-based chemotherapy has been proved to improve prognosis of muscle invasive UTUC patients in several studies. This study is designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of neoadjuvant PD-1 monoclonal antibody combined with cisplatin-based chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC).
