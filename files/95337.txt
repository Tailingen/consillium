Locally ablatIVe thErapy for oLigo-progressive gastrOintestiNal maliGnancies (LIVELONG)
This is a phase 2 pragmatic study that evaluates the clinical benefit of continuing systemic therapy with the addition of locally ablative therapies for oligo-progressive solid tumors as the primary objective. The primary outcome measure is the time to treatment failure (defined as time to change in systemic failure or permanent discontinuation of therapy) following locally ablative therapy.

This is a phase 2 pragmatic study at a single site that evaluates the clinical benefit of continuing systemic therapy with the addition of locally ablative therapies for oligo-progressive solid tumors as the primary objective. The primary endpoint is disease control at 3 months, defined as continuation in systemic cancer therapy without any changes or permanent discontinuation for 3 months following first day of ablative local therapy. Participants will receive ablative local therapy per standard practices in addition to their systemic therapy and will be followed for up to 5 years following ablative local therapy. Participants will be assigned stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) or interventional radiology (IR) ablation therapy per the discretion of treating radiation oncologist and/or interventional radiologist.
