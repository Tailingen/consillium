the New Geneswell BCT in Vitro Diagnosis of Breast Cancer Prognosis
Geneswell BCT is a precise and qualitative in vitro diagnostic test. The expression of 9 genes was obtained from the formalin fixed paraffin embedded block (FFPE) of breast cancer tissue samples by RT-qPCR, and the patients were divided into high-risk group and low-risk group.

This test provides prognostic information to assess the risk of recurrence. The BCT score calculated by geneswell BCT was associated with the risk of recurrence. The higher the BCT score, the more likely it is to relapse, and vice versa.
