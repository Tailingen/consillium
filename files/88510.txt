Study of TAK-733 in Combination With Alisertib in Adult Patients With Advanced Nonhematologic Malignancies
This is a Multicenter, Open-label, Phase 1b Study of TAK-733 in Combination With Alisertib in Adult Patients With Advanced Nonhematologic Malignancies
Advanced Nonhematologic Malignancies
DRUG: TAK-733 and alisertib
Number of Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), assessments of clinical laboratory values, and vital sign measurements, To evaluate the safety profile and to determine DLTs, MTDs, and RP2D of oral TAK-733 + alisertib in patients with advanced nonhematologic malignancies, From signing of the informed consent form through 30 days after the last dose of study drug|TAK-733 and alisertib PK parameters including, but not limited to Cmax, Tmax, Area Under Curve (AUC), apparent oral clearance (CL/F), peak-to-trough ratio, and accumulation ratio, To characterize the single- and multiple-dose plasma PK of TAK-733 and alisertib in patients with advanced nonhematologic malignancies, Escalation and MTD Refinement: Cycle 1-Day 1, 2, 7, 8, 14,and 15; Tumor Expansion Cohort: Cycle 1-Day 1, 7, 8, and 15; Cycle 2-Day 1, 8,and 15; PK Expansion Cohort: Cycle 1-Day 1, 7, and 8; Cycle 2-Day 7, 14, and 15. Each cycle is a 21 days cycle
Measures of disease response, including objective response rate and duration of response based on investigator's assessment using RECIST guidelines, To evaluate evidence of antitumor activity of TAK-733 + alisertib, On screening; Cycle 2: between Day 15 and 21, and every third cycle thereafter (5,8,11 etc.) until progressive disease for approximately 1 year
