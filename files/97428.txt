Antineoplaston Therapy in Treating Patients With Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
Current therapies for Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma provide limited benefit to the patient. The anti-cancer properties of Antineoplaston therapy suggest that it may prove beneficial in the treatment of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

PURPOSE: This study is being performed to determine the effects (good and bad) that Antineoplaston therapy has on patients with Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.
Non Hodgkin Lymphoma
DRUG: Antineoplaston therapy (Atengenal + Astugenal)
Number of Participants With an Objective Response, Stable Disease, or Progressive Disease, An objective response is defined as a complete or partial response. A complete response is complete disappearance of all tumor by physical examination and radiographic studies and bone marrow involvement, if appropriate, for a minimum of four weeks. A partial response is a \> 50% reduction in the sum of the products of the greatest perpendicular diameters of all measurable lesions compared to the corresponding baseline evaluation, for a minimum of four weeks. Stable disease indicates \< 50% change in the sum of the products of the greatest perpendicular diameters of all measurable lesions compared to the corresponding baseline evaluation, for a minimum of twelve weeks. Progressive Disease is a \> 50% increase in the sum of the products of the greatest perpendicular diameters of all measurable lesions compared to the corresponding baseline evaluation, for a minimum of four weeks., 5 months
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the safety and possible effectiveness of antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who have failed high-dose chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation.
* Describe the response to, tolerance to, and side effects of this regimen in these patients.

Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma patients receive gradually escalating doses of intravenous Antineoplaston therapy (Atengenal + Astugenal) until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. Treatment continues up to 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

OBJECTIVES:

* To determine the efficacy of Antineoplaston therapy in patients with Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, as measured by an objective response to therapy (complete response, partial response or stable disease).
* To determine the safety and tolerance of Antineoplaston therapy in patients with Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.
* To determine objective response, tumor size is measured utilizing physical examination, radiologic studies, and bone marrow biopsies as necessary, performed every 8 weeks for the first two years, every 3 months for the third and fourth years, every 6 months for the 5th and sixth years, and annually thereafter.
