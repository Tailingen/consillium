Effectivity and Safety of Ultrasound-guided Percutaneously Laser Ablation for Refractory Neoplasms
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ultrasonography (US) -guided laser ablation liver, kidney, pancreas, lung and retroperitoneal tumors, the investigators used preoperative and postoperative US/CEUS/CT/MRI to assess lesions, and laboratory tests including the tumor markers to evaluate the general condition of patients. Intraoperative US/CEUS/CT would be applied to monitor ablation lesions.
Refractory Neoplasms
