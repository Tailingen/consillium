A Study Investigating agenT-797 in Participants With Relapsed/Refractory Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1, open-label study to explore the safety, tolerability, and preliminary clinical activity of agenT-797, an unmodified, allogeneic iNKT cell therapy, in participants with relapsed/refractory (r/r) solid tumors, as well as define the recommended phase II dose in solid tumors. This Phase 1 study will also explore the safety, tolerability, and preliminary clinical activity of agenT-797 in combination with approved immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), including pembrolizumab and nivolumab, in participants with r/r solid tumors.

Number Of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), This will be determined according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (NCI CTCAE v5.0)., Baseline through 12 months|Number Of Adverse Events (AEs) By The Dose Of iNKT Cell Therapy, This will be determined according to the NCI CTCAE v5.0., Baseline through 12 months|Number Of TEAEs By The Dose Of iNKT Cell Therapy, This will be determined according to the NCI CTCAE v5.0., Baseline through 12 months|Severity Grade Of AEs By Dose Of iNKT Cell Therapy, This will be determined according to the NCI CTCAE v5.0., Baseline through 12 months|Number Of Dose-limiting Toxicities, Baseline through first 14 days after administration
Persistence Of agenT-797 In Peripheral Blood Samples, This will be measured as a length of time, through collection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and analysis by flow cytometry., Baseline/Day 1 (pre-infusion, 5 minutes, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 hours after cell infusion), and on Days 2, 5, 8, 15, 22, and 29; Weeks 6, 8, and 12; and Months 6, 9, and 12|Objective Response Rate (ORR), For solid tumors, this will be determined per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 guidelines and for prostate cancer (not evaluable per RECIST 1.1), Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) will be used., Up to 12 months|Duration Of Response (DOR), For solid tumors, this will be determined per RECIST 1.1 guidelines and for prostate cancer (not evaluable per RECIST 1.1), PCWG3 will be used., Up to 12 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS), For solid tumors, this will be determined per RECIST 1.1 guidelines and for prostate cancer (not evaluable per RECIST 1.1), PCWG3 will be used., Up to 12 months|Incidence Of Panel-reactive Antibody, Baseline/Day 1 (pre-infusion), Day 8, Day 15, Day 29, Week 8, Week 12, Month 6, and end of study visit (up to 12 months)|Incidence Of Donor-specific Antibody, Baseline/Day 1 (pre-infusion), Day 8, Day 15, Day 29, Week 8, Week 12, Month 6, and end of study visit (up to 12 months)
