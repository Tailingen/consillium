Expanded Access to T-cell Depleted Haplo-Identical Stem Cells for Patients Receiving Haplo-Identical and Unrelated Cord Blood Transplants
The objective of this study is to make T-cell depleted stem cells from a family member who is a half match (haplo-identical) available on an expanded access basis to patients receiving one or two unrelated cord blood transplants who are at a higher risk of not engrafting in a safe amount of time. The purpose of the related stem cells is the give the bone marrow a "jump start" towards recovery. Ultimately, the cord blood cells will grow and permanently rescue the bone marrow.

The primary purpose of the study is to provide expanded access of T-cell depleted haplo-identical stem cells for patients receiving allogeneic transplantation from a related haplo-identical donor and an unrelated, umbilical cord blood (UUCB) unit(s) for the treatment of high risk malignancies and non-malignant disorders. The T-cell depleted haplo-identical stems cells are intended to facilitate early, short-term myeloid engraftment with the primary goal of minimizing early infections and other non-relapse mortality while the UUCB cells engraft as the durable and permanent graft. Patients with high risk or refractory malignancies, or non-malignant disorders amenable to stem cell transplantation therapy but lacking conventional related or unrelated donors will be eligible for this protocol.
