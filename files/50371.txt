Outcomes of mesorectal excision patients will be analysed. Medical records will be reviewed and perioperative outcomes retrieved, incl. long-term oncological and functional/quality of life data. A retrospective cohort over 10 years (2007-2016) will serve as a control to a prospective cohort over 10 further years (2017-2026) as to investigate trends in perioperative and oncological outcomes (min. follow-up of 5 years + adequate cohort size). Prospective data on bowel function, urogenital function and quality of life will measured at time of diagnosis and further. Variations in neoadjuvant/adjuvant treatment and surgical approaches will be assessed for their effect on the outcomes of interest.
