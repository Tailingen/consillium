Phase II Study With Cabozantinib in Patients With RET Positive NSCLC
This study is aimed to explore the antitumor activity, safety and efficacy profile of cabozantinib in pretreated, advanced RET-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer patients
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Cabozantinib 20 MG|DRUG: Cabozantinib 40 MG|DRUG: Cabozantinib 60 MG
Response Rate (RR), Exact binomial method will be used to estimate the response rate (CR+PR) and its 95% confidence interval.Proportion of patients presenting Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) or Stable Disease (SD) based on the Investigator's assessment according to standard RECIST criteria v1.1. Patients with no tumor assessment after baseline will be classified as non-responders., From the start of treatment ( Baseline) to the progression of Disease (PD) or trial discontinuation whichever occurs first, assessed up to 24 months
Toxicity (frequency of adverse events), the assessment of safety will be based mainly on the frequency of adverse events; toxicity will be measured according to NCI Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Event (CTCAE), version 4.03., From the start of treatment ( Baseline) to the progression of Disease (PD) or trial discontinuation whichever occurs first, assessed up to 24 months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS will be calculated from the first treatment intake to the date of progressive disease, or death., From the start of treatment ( Baseline) to the progression of Disease (PD) or trial discontinuation whichever occurs first, assessed up to 24 months|Overall survival (OS), OS will be calculated from the first treatment intake to death from any cause., From the start of treatment ( Baseline) to the progression of Disease (PD) or trial discontinuation whichever occurs first, assessed up to 24 months|Duration of response (DOR, DOR will be calculated from the first treatment intake to the date of disease progression or death., From the start of treatment ( Baseline) to the progression of Disease (PD) or trial discontinuation whichever occurs first, assessed up to 24 months|Disease Control Rate(DCR), DCR will be measured as the sum of complete and partial responses + stable disease., From the start of treatment ( Baseline) to the progression of Disease (PD) or trial discontinuation whichever occurs first, assessed up to 24 months
RET aberration, Detection of RET aberration on DNA extracted from circulating tumor cells (CTCs) isolated in blood at baseline (optional), On the start of treatment (Baseline) and through study completion, an average of 1 year|RET-rearrangment on tumor tissue, Archival tumor tissue (FFPE tumor block or 7-10 unstained slides) will be assessed for determination of RET-rearrangment on tumor cells by using A FISH evaluation of the translocation will be performed using a break-apart probe for the 10p11 locus., At the start of treatment (baseline)
This study is aimed to explore the antitumor activity, safety and efficacy profile of cabozantinib in pretreated, advanced RET-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer patients
