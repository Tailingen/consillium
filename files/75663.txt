UARK 2003-41: A Study of High-Dose Density Therapy in Patients With Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of this study is to find out if treating multiple myeloma (MM) patients with more intense chemotherapy and autologous transplant (high dose density therapy) early in the disease course will result in better treatment outcomes compared to patients treated in the past.
Multiple Myeloma
PROCEDURE: High-Dose Density Therapy
To evaluate whether high-dose density treatment during the initial seven months, including tandem transplants within six months after starting therapy, results in superior event-free and overall survival rates as compared to historical controls., seven months
To evaluate the ability of pegfilgrastim to mobilize stem cells when administered following DTPACE in MM patients with active disease, compared to historical controls mobilized with DTPACE and either GM-CSF or G-CSF., annually
This study will evaluate whether high-dose density treatment during the initial seven months, including tandem transplants within six months after starting therapy, results in superior event-free and overall survival rates as compared to historical controls.
