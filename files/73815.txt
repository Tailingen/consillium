This is a Phase 1/1b, multicenter open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and clinical activity of escalating doses of RMC-6236 in adult patients with advanced solid tumors harboring specific RAS mutations, and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose \[RP2D\] within investigated patient population groups. RMC-6236 is a potent, orally bioavailable RAS-MULTI(ON) inhibitor, selective for the active RAS(ON) form of both wild type and mutant variants of the canonical RAS isoforms (HRAS, NRAS, and KRAS).
