Busulfan, Melphalan, Escalating Carfilzomib Conditioning Auto Stem Cell Transplantation for Multiple Myeloma (MM)
In this protocol, the investigators hypothesize that the combination of intravenous busulfan and melphalan with carfilzomib will be an effective preparative regimen with acceptable toxicity for participants with multiple myeloma who are candidates for autologous stem cell transplantation. To test this hypothesis, the investigators designed a phase I/II trial combining IV busulfan 130 mg/m2 plus melphalan 140 mg combined with escalating doses of carfilzomib ranging from 20 mg/m2 to 45 mg/m2. These results will be compared with the center's historical controls of participants treated with melphalan, busulfan and bortezomib.

Participants enrolled in this study protocol will receive daily intravenous (IV) infusions of carfilzomib for a total of 4 days (Day-9, -8 and Days -2, -1). The first two daily infusions will be given at a fixed dose of 20 mg/m2 and the final two doses will be escalated from the standard dose of 27 mg/m2 to 56 mg/m2 in a Phase I design, based on toxicity. The busulfan will be administered for 2 days over 3 hours from D-7, -6, at 130 mg/m2 . This dose was found to be safe and equivalent to the standard daily dose of 3.2 mg/kg. The 3rd and 4th daily doses of IV Busulfan will be adjusted in order to yield a systemic plasma drug exposure represented by a daily area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) of approximately 5,000 millimoles-minute per dose (mM-min). These targeted plasma concentration of IV busulfan will be based on pharmacokinetics studies performed during the first day of IV busulfan. Melphalan will be given at a dose of 140 mg/m2 on Day -3. Each cohort will start with a goal of accruing three patients to determine the dose limiting toxicity.
