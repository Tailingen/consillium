Estramustine, Docetaxel, and Carboplatin for Patients With Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer Progressing After Mitoxantrone-Based Chemotherapy.
This study is for patients with prostate cancer that is metastatic, progressive, and resistant to hormonal manipulation and mitoxantrone chemotherapy.Patients have previously been treated with surgical removal of the testes or hormone therapy, and subsequently with chemotherapy that included the drug, mitoxantrone (Novantrone). Patients will have prostate cancer that has worsened despite these treatments.

We hope to learn whether the combination chemotherapy decreases cancer symptoms and tests, and to determine how frequently serious side effects occur with acceptable toxicity from the chemotherapy.
