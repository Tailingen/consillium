7 cohorts of first-line chemotherapy regimens combined with durvalumab + tremelimumab.

This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of durvalumab (MEDI4736) + tremelimumab in combination with first line chemotherapy regimens in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors: ovarian/peritoneal/fallopian tube cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), and gastric/gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) cancer, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).
