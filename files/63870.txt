Safety and Efficacy of Unrelated Umbilical Cord Blood Microtransplantation in Patients With Higher-risk MDS
This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of unrelated umbilical cord blood microtransplantation in the treatment of above-mentioned MDS patients by observing the factors related to the efficacy and adverse reactions.
Myelodysplastic Syndromes
BIOLOGICAL: Unrelated Umbilical Cord Blood|DRUG: Venetoclax|DRUG: Decetabine|DRUG: Azacitidine
Complete response (CR) rate, CR rate is defined as the percentage of patients who met the following conditions:

Myelogram: naïve cells less than 5% (at least 200 nucleated cells); Hemogram: absolute neutrophil count \> 1.0×10\^9/L, platelet count \> 100×10\^9/L; Clinical diagnosis: no symptoms and signs caused by leukemia infiltration, and patients do not rely on blood transfusion., 28±7 days|Hematopoietic recovery time, The time of absolute neutrophil count\>0.5×10\^9/L and platelet count \>30×10\^9/L for 3 consecutive days., 28±7 days
Time to Progression（TTP）, Time from enrollment to objective progression of disease, 1 year|Disease Free Survival（DFS）, From CR to recurrence or death or to the date of last follow-up, 1 year|Overall Survival（OS）, From the beginning of treatment to death or to the date of last follow-up, 1 year|Early mortality rate, Death within the first 3 months of induction therapy, 3 months
Changes in lymphocyte subsets (NK cells, T cells) before and after treatment, The concentration of lymphocyte subsets in peripheral blood can be detected by flow cytometry, At the time of enrollment and at 1 month|Correlation between human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching and the concentration of lymphocyte subsets, HLA typing and matching can be assessed by sequence based genotyping (PCR-SBT), and the concentration of lymphocyte subsets in peripheral blood can be detected by flow cytometry, HLA typing and matching will be assessed at the time of enrollment, and the concentration of lymphocyte subsets in peripheral blood will be detected at the time of enrollment and at 1 month
