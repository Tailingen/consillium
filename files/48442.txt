A Study of PET/CT Scans With the Radioactive Tracer 89Zr-DFO-Daratumumab in People With Myeloma
The purpose of this study is to see if using the radioactive tracer 89Zr-DFO-daratumumab with PET/CT scans is a practical and effective way to view and monitor multiple myeloma in participants before and during their treatment with daratumumab. We also want to see if 89Zr-DFO-daratumumab PET/CT scans can predict a participant's response to therapy, and if they can better locate any leftover disease following treatment compared to the standard imaging methods.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: 89Zr-DFO-daratumumab|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: PET/CT
number of patient's with positive tumors, Uptake of FDG PET/CT, 1 year
assess if tumor uptake of 89Zr-DFO-daratumumab predicts response to daratumumab/lenalidomide therapy, The response will be defined using IMWG criteria as complete or partial response; stable disease and progressive disease will be considered as non-response., 1 year
