Fluzoparib+Bevacizumab/Dietary Intervention vs Fluzoparib Monotherapy as First-line Maintenance in HRD+/- Advanced Ovarian Cancer
Fluzoparib has been approved for the first-line maintenance treatment of advanced ovarian cancer in the full population . Previous studies have demonstrated that anti-angiogenic agents enhance tumor cell sensitivity to PARP inhibitors . In vitro evidence suggests that low-carbohydrate culture conditions may restore PARP inhibitor sensitivity in HRD-negative tumor cells. This study aims to validate the survival benefits of fluzoparib combined with bevacizumab in HRD-positive ovarian cancer patients during first-line maintenance therapy and explore the efficacy of fluzoparib combined with a dietary intervention in HRD-negative populations.

Progression-Free Survival (PFS), The time from randomization to the occurrence of disease progression (as per RECIST v1.1) or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 96 months
