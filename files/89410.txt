Study of Oral Venetoclax Tablets in Combination With Intravenous Obinutuzumab Injection to Assess Achievement of Best Response in Adult Participants With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
Chronic Lymphoid Leukemia (CLL) is the most common type of leukemia (cancer of blood cells) in adults affecting men more so than women. The main objective of this study is to assess the how effective venetoclax (Venclexta) in combination with Obinutuzumab is in treating Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL). Effectiveness is assessed by achievement of best response.

Venetoclax is an approved drug developed for the treatment of CLL. Approximately 50 adult participants with previously untreated CLL will be enrolled in approximately 10 to 15 sites in Russian Federation.

Participants will receive oral venetoclax tablets in combination with intravenous (IV) Obinutuzumab as prescribed by the physician prior to enrolling in this study in accordance to the local practice and label.

There may be a higher burden for participants in this study compared to standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood tests, checking for side effects and completing questionnaires.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)
Percentage of Participants Achieving Overall Response Rate (ORR) Best Response, ORR is defined as complete remission (CR) + complete remission with incomplete bone marrow recovery (CRi) + partial remission (PR) + nodular partial remission (nPR)., Up to approximately 36 Months
Percentage of Participants Achieving Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as CR + CRi + PR + nPR., Up to 12 Months|Time to First Response, Time to first response is defined as number of days from first venetoclax intake to first response., Up to approximately 36 Months|Time to Best Response, Time to best response is defined as number of days from first venetoclax intake to best response (CR, CRi, PR, nPR)., Up to approximately 36 Months|Duration of Response (DoR), Duration of Response (DoR) is defined as number of days from first response to disease progression or death from any cause, whichever comes first., Up to approximately 36 Months|Time to Next Treatment, Time to next treatment is defined as number of days from first venetoclax intake to first intake of next treatment including death from any cause., Up to approximately 36 Months|Minimal Residual Disease (MRD), Percentage of participants achieving MRD (CLL \< 10000 leucocytes) in the bone marrow, peripheral blood, either and both will be assessed., Up to 36 Months|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the number of days from the date of first dose to the date of the observational period end or death for all dosed participants., Up to 36 Months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the interval (in days) between the first treatment day to the first sign of disease progression or death from any cause., Up to 36 Months|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. The investigator assesses the relationship of each event to the use of study. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization, results in a congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is an important medical event that, based on medical judgment, may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above., Up to approximately 36 Months
