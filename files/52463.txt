Evaluation of Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and Preliminary Efficacy of Isatuximab in Chinese Patients With Relapsed and/or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
Primary Objective:

To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of isatuximab.

Secondary Objectives:

* To evaluate the safety and tolerability of isatuximab.
* To assess the preliminary antitumor effect of isatuximab.
* To evaluate the immunogenicity of isatuximab.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Isatuximab SAR650984
Assessment of PK: Cmax, To evaluate the maximum observed concentration (Cmax), Cycle 1, up to 168 hours after start of infusion|Assessment of PK: tmax, To evaluate the time to reach Cmax (tmax), Cycle 1, up to 168 hours after start of infusion|Assessment of PK: AUC0-168h, To evaluate area under the plasma concentration versus time curve over the dosing interval (AUC0-168h), Cycle 1, up to 168 hours after start of infusion|Assessment of PK: Ceoi, To evaluate the concentration observed at the end of an IV infusion (Ceoi), Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 2 Day 1, Cycle 4 Day 1; Cycle duration is 28 days|Assessment of PK: Ctrough, To evaluate concentration observed just before investigational medicinal product (IMP) administration during repeated dosing (Ctrough), Up to approximately 40 weeks (Cycle 10)
Adverse Events, Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)/Serious Adverse Events (SAE) based on standard and systematic assessment including infusion associated reactions (IARs), laboratory test abnormalities, vital signs and ECOG performance status, Up to 30 days after the last IMP administration|Anti-tumor activity: Overall response (ORR), Proportion of patients achieving: stringent complete response (sCR), complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), or partial response (PR) according to International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG 2016) criteria, Up to 12 months after last patient treated|Anti-Tumor Activity: Duration of response (DOR), Time from the date of the first determined response to the date of subsequent determined progressive disease or death, whichever happens earlier, Up to 12 months after last patient treated|Anti-Tumor Activity: Time to progression (TTP), Time interval from the date of first IMP administration to the date of the first assessed disease progression using IMWG criteria, Up to 12 months after last patient treated|Anti-Tumor Activity: Progression free survival (PFS), Time interval from the date of first IMP administration to the date of the first documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever comes first, Up to 12 months after last patient treated|Anti-Tumor Activity: Overall survival (OS), Time interval from the date of first IMP administration to death due to any cause, Up to 12 months after last patient treated|Immunogenicity, To evaluate the presence of antidrug antibodies (ADA) to isatuximab, Up to 13 months (10 cycles + 3 months) after last patient treated
The duration of the study for an individual patient will include a screening period of up to 21 days, a treatment period of repeated 28-day cycles, and a follow-up period. End of treatment visit will be done at 30 (Â±7) days after last treatment.
