The study will use a cross-sectional study design with a follow-up 2-arm randomized controlled trial with that has assessments at baseline, post-intervention (i.e., Week 12), and 3-months post-intervention (i.e., Week 24). The 2 arms are the 12-week intervention and a health education control among 60 Black breast cancer survivors.

Feasibility of the exercise program (Retention), Percent of patients that complete the intervention, up to 24 weeks after start of intervention|Feasibility of the exercise program (Adherence), Percent of patients that complete the exercise sessions, 12 weeks after start of intervention|Feasibility of the exercise program (fidelity), Upon completion of the trial, a random sample of 10 recorded sessions will be analyzed for fidelity. Research staff who did not conduct the intervention will use a "fidelity checklist" of specific exercises and intervention characteristics (e.g., allowing time for questions, cueing for proper posture and form, etc.) required for each exercise session.., 12 weeks after start of intervention|Satisfaction of program, 14-item scale measuring ease of use, convenience, engagement, enjoyment, and privacy elements of the intervention., up to 24 weeks after start of intervention|Affective attitude, 36-item scale assessing views, attitude, and experiences in exercise87, up to 24 weeks after start of intervention|Perceived burden, Single item, "Now that you've completed this part of the study, how burdensome or difficult did you find the experience. Select the response that best represents your experience." (1= Very burdensome to 5= Not too burdensome.), up to 24 weeks after start of intervention|Outcome expectation, 15-item scale assessing physical, social, and self-evaluative outcomes of exercise, up to 24 weeks after start of intervention
