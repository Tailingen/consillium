Penetration of Cefazolin Into Hepatic Cysts
Hepatic cysts are fluid-filled cavities located in the liver parenchyma. They are usually asymptomatic, but can cause mass-related symptoms as abdominal pain, dyspnea and nausea. Aspiration sclerotherapy is indicated in patients with a dominant hepatic cyst to alleviate symptoms by draining the hepatic cyst to reduce cyst diameter. Spontaneous cyst infection, or following aspiration sclerotherapy, presents a severe complication of hepatic cystic disease requiring frequent hospitalization, long-term antibiotic treatment, and in some invasive therapies. Evidence that antibiotics are able to reach adequate intracystic concentration is however lacking. To prevent procedure-related cyst infection in patients receiving aspiration sclerotherapy, cefazolin prophylaxis is given as standard of care. In this study we want to assess the hepatic cyst penetration capacity of cefazolin by comparing serum and cyst fluid concentrations of cefazolin. We hypothesize that cefazolin is able to penetrate hepatic cysts, with treatment naïve cyst allowing a better penetration, reducing the risk of developing cyst infection following aspiration sclerotherapy.
