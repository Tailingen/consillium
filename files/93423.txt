Genomically Guided Radiation Therapy in the Management of Triple Negative Breast Cancer
The purpose of the study is to determine the feasibility of genomically guided radiation therapy (RT) in people with triple negative (HER2 negative, hormone receptor negative) breast cancer undergoing breast conservation therapy.
Triple Negative Breast Cancer
RADIATION: Genomically Guided Radiation Therapy|RADIATION: Genomically Guided Radiation Therapy
Local Control, Local control will be defined as lack of progression in the ipsilateral breast as documented by response assessment imaging, At 3 Years
Overall Survival (OS), OS will be measured from the date of study initiation to the date of death due to any cause., Up to 5 Years|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is measured from the date of first treatment to the date of first observation of PD or death due to any cause., Up to 5 years|Distant Control, Distant control will be defined by lack of progression outside the irradiated treatment field, Up to 5 Years|Quality of Life following Genomically Guided Dose Personalization, Quality of life (QOL) will be assessed through the completion of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for Breast Cancer questionnaire (FACT-B). This quality of life questionnaire contains questions from the FACT-General (G) questionnaire in the domains of physical, social/family, emotional, and functional well-being as well as additional questions pertaining to patients with breast cancer. The questionnaire will be completed at screening, during protocol therapy and at follow-up visits, Up to 5 Years
