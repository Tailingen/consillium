Hematopoiesis in MBL and CLL Versus Healthy Age-Matched Control Subjects
This study evaluates hematopoiesis to determine how MBL/CLL affected bone marrow responds to fight off infections in the body.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Monoclonal B-Cell Lymphocytosis
OTHER: Non-Interventional Study
Effects of MBL on bone marrow function, Samples collected from healthy participants and participants with MBL will be compared for differences in bone marrow function (i.e., ability to fight off infection). Results will be descriptive. With participant permission, samples will be stored for future research use., Baseline|Effects of CLL on bone marrow function, Samples collected from healthy participants and participants with CLL will be compared for differences in bone marrow function (i.e., ability to fight off infection).

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Determine the cellular and mechanistic basis of bone marrow (BM) hematopoietic dysfunction in untreated MBL and CLL patients.

II. Determine if MBL and CLL B cell derived cellular products directly alter the differentiation and functional capacities of Hematopoietic Stem and Progenitor Cells (HSPCs).

III. Utilize the Emu-Tcl1 transgenic mouse model to determine how MBL and CLL patient-derived cellular products alter BM hematopoiesis.

OUTLINE: This is an observational study.

Patients undergo blood sample collection and bone marrow aspiration and biopsy and have their medical records reviewed on study.
