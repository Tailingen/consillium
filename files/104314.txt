Tuvusertib (M1774) Human Mass Balance and Absolute Bioavailability Study (DDRIVER Solid Tumors 303)
This is a single sequence 2-period open label study in participants with advanced solid tumors. The purpose of Period 1 of this study is to assess the mass balance to determine drug-related entities present in circulation and excreta and provide a comprehensive understanding of biotransformation pathways and clearance mechanisms in participants with advanced solid tumors. The purpose of Period 1a is to assess the extent of ABA of tuvusertib and the mass balance, PK, metabolism, and elimination of 14C-tuvusertib after iv dosing in participants with advanced solid tumors. After either Period 1 or Period 1a; participants may enter an optional extension phase (Period 2) where participants will receive tuvusertib until disease progression or other criteria for study intervention discontinuation are met.
