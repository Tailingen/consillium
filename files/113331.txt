Magnevist (SH L 451A) Intra-individual Dose Comparison Study in Patients With Brain Metastasis
To verify the number of metastatic brain tumors detected in contrast-enhanced MRI, which is the primary variable, increases after an additional dose of Magnevist (SH L 451A) comparing images after an initial dose (0.1 mmol/kg) with those after an additional dose (0.1 mmol/kg, a total dose of 0.2 mmol/kg) intra-individually in patients with metastatic brain tumors. Safety was also to be assessed.
