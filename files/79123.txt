Clinical Study of MRD Recurrence Monitoring After Surgical Resection of Hepatocellular Carcinoma
ctDNA-based liquid biopsy can better detect the presence of MRD before imaging and serological markers, and is suitable for postoperative MRD and recurrence monitoring, which has been clinically validated in several cancer types such as lung cancer and intestinal cancer. However, there is no systematic comparative study of postoperative MRD and recurrence monitoring based on ctDNA testing in hepatocellular carcinoma. A prospective multicenter observational clinical study is proposed to evaluate the use of liquid biopsy based on ctDNA NGS assay in surgical evaluation, MRD and molecular recurrence state monitoring after radical resection of hepatocellular carcinoma, and to compare with imaging and serological findings with the aim of early detection of disease recurrence or metastasis and more survival benefits for patients.
