Implications of MEDIcal Low Dose RADiation Exposure - BReast Cancer Acute Coronary Events
MEDIRAD-BRACE aims to determine the relationship between 3D dose distributions in cardiac structures and the risk of acute coronary events (ACE) and other cardiac complications in breast cancer (BC) patients to develop and externally validate multivariable Normal Tissue Complication Probability (NTCP) models to assess the risk of ACE in individual patients based on cardiac dose metrics in the first 10 years after BC radiotherapy.
