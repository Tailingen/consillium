A Study of CS1001 in Subjects With Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter phase III study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CS1001 in subjects with locally advanced/unresectable (Stage III) non-small cell lung cancer that has not progressed after prior concurrent/sequential chemoradiotherapy.

Progress Free Survival (PFS), The primary endpoint is the PFS of CS1001 versus placebo (evaluated by blinded independent central review(BICR) according to response evaluation criteria in solid tumors RECIST v1.1)., from the date of randomization to the first date of recorded progression or all-cause death, whichever comes first, assessed up to 30 months.
