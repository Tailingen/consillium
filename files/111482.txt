HL-085+Vemurafenib to Treat Advanced Melanoma Patients With BRAF V600E/K Mutation
The main purpose of this study is to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of the combination of HL-085 and Vemurafenib in Advanced Melanoma Patients with BRAF V600E/K Mutation. This study includes IIa and IIb phase. Phase IIa will determine the dose regiment for Phase IIb. Phase IIb part will evaluate the efficacy and safety with this combination regiment.

This is a single-arm, multi-center Phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of HL-085 and Vemurafenib in advanced melanoma patients with BRAF V600E/K mutation. There are two phase of this study ( IIa and IIb). Phase IIa will be evaluating the safety and efficacy of the combination regiment (HL-08512mg +Vemurafenib 720mg, and/or some lower dose regiment, such as 9mg+720mg) in 20-30 patients, and final determine the recommended dose regiment for Phase IIb. In Phase IIb will enrolled 74 patients , the primary endpoint is ORR, and the secondary endpoint are PFS. The safety profile of this combined HL-085/Vemurafenib regimen will be monitored during both phases. The treatment period consists of 21-day cycles until progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.
