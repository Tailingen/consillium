Management of Severe Chemotherapy-induced Neutropenia in Advanced Breast Cancer
To assess the safety and establish the dose to assess the pharmacokinetic activity following administration of EC-18 in patients with advanced breast cancer receiving low febrile neutropenia risk chemotherapy who are the candidates for second-line or higher combination therapy with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide.
Febrile Neutropenia
DRUG: EC-18
Duration of Grade 4 neutropenia, Complete blood count and absolute neutrophil count assessed daily to determine febrile neutropenia, 15 days after starting chemotherapy

This study will utilize a non-randomized, open-label 3 + 3 dose escalation design in which subjects will receive 500 mg, 1000 mg, 1500 mg, 2000 mg, 3000 mg and 4000mg of EC-18. The stepwise daily dosing by cohort was performed for 21 days (3 weeks)
