Study on the Applicability of CCR Criteria in Rectal Cancer
This study aims to explore how well the usual ways of checking if rectal cancer patients are free of disease signs after treatment work for a new treatment method. The new method combines chemotherapy, radiation, and immune-boosting drugs before surgery. We know these usual ways work for the standard treatment, but we're not sure if they're good enough for this new combo treatment. We'll look at patients with a specific type of rectal cancer that doesn't respond well to just immune-boosting drugs alone. By comparing how patients treated with the new method and the old method respond, we hope to find better ways to tell if the treatment is really working, which could help improve treatment plans for these patients.

sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and AUC, To evaluate the performance of clinical complete response (cCR) assessment criteria in patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) and neoadjuvant immunochemoradiotherapy (nICRT), we will utilize the area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity as key performance indicators. These metrics will help us assess the effectiveness of the cCR assessment criteria in both treatment groups., January 2025
