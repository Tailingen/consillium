A Study to Analyze Data on Metastatic Ovarian Cancer Using Multi-omics
As one of the most common malignant tumors in women, the incidence of ovarian cancer is expected to increase year by year. Due to its lack of typical symptoms and effective screening methods, and the characteristics of implantation and distant metastasis, more than 70% of ovarian cancers were in the metastatic stage at the time of diagnosis. In this study, the investigators will collect large samples of tissue from patients with ovarian cancer, conduct multi-omics studies, and mapped the characteristic maps of the genome and transcriptome of patients with metastatic ovarian cancer, and explore the molecular mechanisms that can be used as new targets for the treatment of ovarian cancer. Besides, the investigators will design and establish a database of metastatic ovarian cancer, integrate multiple omics, imaging, pathology, and clinical information to study their potential relevance, and analyze the relationship between various omics, imaging, pathology, and prognosis, establish ovaries Cancer prediction model.
Ovarian Cancer
Progression-Free-Survival, The sample will be tested immediately after they are taken from patients and the statistical analysis will be taken through study completion, an average of 3 year
