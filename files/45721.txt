Carboplatin Plus Topotecan in Treating Patients With Relapsed Acute Myelogenous Leukemia
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining carboplatin and topotecan in treating patients with relapsed acute myelogenous leukemia.
Leukemia
DRUG: carboplatin|DRUG: topotecan hydrochloride
overall survival, Up to 5 years
OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of a 5-day continuous infusion of carboplatin and topotecan in patients with relapsed and refractory acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). II. Assess the toxic effects of this treatment in these patients.

OUTLINE: Patients receive continuous intravenous infusions of topotecan and carboplatin for 5 days. Treatment repeats every 3-4 weeks during induction (two courses) and every 6-10 weeks during consolidation. No more than four courses of treatment are given.
