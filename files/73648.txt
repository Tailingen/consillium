TEST: Registry for Endoscopic Head and Neck Surgery
The goal of this data review research study is to create a registry database using information (data) collected from patients who have had Endoscopic Head and Neck Surgery (eHNS). Researchers want to use the registry database to learn more about short-term and long-term outcomes for patients who have eHNS.

1.1 Primary Objective: To develop a registry database of patients who have had eHNS.

1.2 Secondary Objective: To evaluate short-term oncologic parameters and functional outcomes, operative for patients undergoing eHNS performed at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC).

1.3 Tertiary Objective: To collect data on long-term oncologic outcomes including local and distant failure and survival following eHNS.
Head and Neck Cancer
eHNS Registry, Registry database using information (data) collected from participants who have had eHNS., 3 years
Information from medical records will be collected and entered into the registry database at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center for future research related to cancer.

The information collected from medical records will include, but is not limited to, medical history, sex, age, race, gender, type and stage of disease, type of treatment(s) you have received, radiology reports, surgical and pathological reports, the results of any test(s), treatment(s) and/or surgery performed.

This is a registry study evaluating endoscopic head and neck surgery. The data from the surgical resection will be descriptive. Comparisons will be made to non-robotic, open historical controls and patients treated with radiation therapy, based on literature reports.
