Linperlisib-based Treatment Regimen in Newly Diagnosed Nodal T-follicular Helper Cell Lymphoma (nTFHL)
This study is conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of linperlisib combined with CHOP regimen followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and linperlisib monotherapy maintenance for newly diagnosed nTFHL patients.
