Prevention of Graft-Versus-Host Disease in Patients Undergoing Bone Marrow Transplantation
RATIONALE: Bone marrow transplantation may be able to replace immune cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy or radiation therapy used to kill tumor cells. Sometimes the transplanted cells can make an immune response against the body's normal tissues. Stem cells that have been treated in the laboratory to remove lymphocytes may prevent this from happening.

PURPOSE: Clinical trial to prevent graft-versus-host disease in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation.
Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: graft versus host disease prophylaxis/therapy|PROCEDURE: allogeneic bone marrow transplantation
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine whether stem cell augmented, elutriated grafts prevent graft versus host disease in patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.

OUTLINE: Patients receive elutriated CD34+ augmented donor bone marrow on day 0.

Bone marrow samples are obtained before day 100, around 6 months, and 1 year after transplant.
