Correlating Early FDG PET/CT and ctDNA in Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor (ICI)-Treated Melanoma Patients
The purpose of this research study is to determine if analysis of PET/CT scans and testing of blood samples in people with melanoma that has spread in their body can help researchers determine which patients are more or less likely to respond to immunotherapy and are more or less likely to have side effects. 24 participants will be enrolled and be on study until approximately 4 weeks after their first dose of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor therapy.

This is a pilot, prospective, observational study to estimate the degree to which baseline and early interval 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging within 3-4 weeks of ICI therapy initiation can accurately correlate with ctDNA level trends, predict clinical response, onset of immune-related adverse events, and survival outcomes in advanced stage melanoma patients.
