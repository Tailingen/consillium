Multi-center Validation of a Deep Learning Based Bowel Preparation Evaluation System
A deep learning based system to calculate the proportion of Boston Bowel Prep Scale (BBPS) score of 0-1 during withdrawal phase has been constructed previously. This multi-center study is going to perform a prospective observational study to validate the threshold of the adequate proportion.
Adenoma|Bowel Preparation
OTHER: Observational group
Cleanliness assessment of different intestinal segment in the artificial intelligence system, The Artificial intelligence evaluates the Boston Bowel Preparation score of the ascending colon, transverse colon and descending colon in real-time, and calculates the proportion of 0-1 Score, 3 Months|Adenoma detection rate, The numerator is the number of cases of adenomas detected by colonoscopy, and the denominator is the total number of cases of patients undergoing colonoscopy., 3 Months
Advanced adenoma detection rate, The numerator is the number of cases of advanced adenomas detected by colonoscopy, and the denominator is the total number of cases of patients undergoing colonoscopy., 3 Months|Polyps detection rate, The numerator is the number of cases of polyps detected by colonoscopy, and the denominator is the total number of cases of patients undergoing colonoscopy., 3 Months|The mean number of adenomas per procedure, The numerator is the total number of polyps detected by colonoscopy, and the denominator is the total number of patients undergoing colonoscopy, 3 Months|Detection rate of large, small and diminutive polyps, The numerator was the number of patients with large (≥10 mm), small (\>5 to \<10 mm), and diminutive(≤5 mm) polyps detected by colonoscopy, and the denominator was the total number of patients receiving colonoscopy., 3 Months|The mean number of large, small and diminutive polyps per procedure, The numerator was the number of large (≥10 mm), small (\>5 to \<10 mm), and diminutive(≤5 mm) polyps detected by colonoscopy, and the denominator was the total number of patients receiving colonoscopy., 3 Months|Detection rate of large, small and diminutive adenomas, The numerator was the number of patients with large (≥10 mm), small (\>5 to \<10 mm), and diminutive(≤5 mm) adenomas detected by colonoscopy, and the denominator was the total number of patients receiving colonoscopy., 3 Months|The mean number of large, small and diminutive adenomas per procedure, The numerator was the number of large (≥10 mm), small (\>5 to \<10 mm), and diminutive(≤5 mm) adenomas detected by colonoscopy, and the denominator was the total number of patients receiving colonoscopy., 3 Months|Detection rate of adenoma in different sites, The numerator is the number of cases of adenoma detected in the rectum, sigmoid colon, descending colon, transverse colon, ascending colon and ileocecal region during colonoscopy, and the denominator is the total number of patients undergoing colonoscopy., 3 Months|The mean number of adenomas in different sites per procedure, The numerator is the total number of adenomas detected in the rectum, sigmoid colon, descending colon, transverse colon, ascending colon and ileocecal region during colonoscopy, and the denominator is the total number of patients undergoing colonoscopy., 3 Months|Time of colonoscopic insertion/withdrawal, The duration of colonoscopic insertion from rectum to ileocecal valve or appendiceal opening and the duration of colonoscopic withdrawal from ileocecal valve or appendiceal opening to colonoscopy finished., 3 Months
Inadequate bowel preparation is insufficient for identification of polyps greater than 5 mm. However, bowel preparation assessment involved subjectivity and uncertainty. We constructed a deep learning based system to calculate the proportion of Boston Bowel Prep Scale (BBPS) score of 0-1 during withdrawal phase and performed a prospective observational study to validate the threshold of the adequate proportion.The multi-center study is aimed to verify the extrapolation and robustness of the scoring threshold based on artificial intelligence intestinal cleanliness evaluation system explored in the early stage, and propose a more accurate and quantifiable threshold for evaluating the eligibility of intestinal preparation.
