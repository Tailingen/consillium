A Phase 1 Study in Patients With Solid Tumors
The primary objective of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) regimen for the combination therapy of LY573636 and pemetrexed that may be safely administered to patients with a solid tumor that is not amenable to curative therapy.
Solid Tumors
DRUG: LY573636|DRUG: Pemetrexed
Recommended Phase 2 Dose, Based on maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in Cycle 1: highest dose where \<33% participants (pts) had dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). DLTs were adverse events (AE) possibly related to study drug or AEs that met any of National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for AEs (CTAE): Grade (G) 4 neutropenia lasting ≥5 days; G4 neutropenia with fever, G4 thrombocytopenia, G3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding, ≥G3 non-hematologic toxicity (except nausea/vomiting and diarrhea controlled by medication; electrolyte toxicity resolved with standard replacement treatment; alopecia; and elevated alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase with preexisting hepatic metastasis, if agreed by investigator). Investigators, with sponsor, could declare a DLT if pt experienced increasing toxicity during treatment and it was clear that further treatment would expose pt to excessive risk. Enrollment was stopped during the dose-escalation phase, thus further dose-escalation was not explored., Baseline to toxicity [up to end of Cycle 1 (cycle = 21 or 28 days)]
Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Effects, Clinically significant effects were defined as serious and other non-serious adverse events (AEs) regardless of causality. A summary of serious and all other non-serious AEs is located in the Reported Adverse Events module., Baseline to end of study (up to 1 year of treatment plus 30-day follow-up)|Percentage of Participants With a Tumor Response, Tumor response was evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria and confirmed by repeat assessment. Complete Response (CR) was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions and the normalization of tumor marker levels for non-target lesions; Partial Response (PR) was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions. Percentage of participants with a tumor response = (number of participants with CR or PR/number of enrolled participants)\*100., Baseline to progressive disease (up to 1 year of treatment plus 30-day follow-up)|Pharmacokinetics, Concentration Maximum (Cmax) of LY573636, Cycles 1 and 2 on Day 4 (prior to and at the end of LY573636 infusion, 2 and 4 hours post LY573636 infusion), Day 8 (anytime), Day 15 (anytime)|Pharmacokinetics, Area Under the Curve (AUC) of LY573636, Area under the concentration-time curve above the albumin corrected threshold (AUCalb) is provided for LY573636, which has been found to be highly bound to albumin. AUCalb is a surrogate measure of exposure to unbound (free) LY573636., Cycles 1 and 2 on Day 4 (prior to and at the end of LY573636 infusion, 2 and 4 hours post LY573636 infusion), Day 8 (anytime), Day 15 (anytime)
