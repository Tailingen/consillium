Pelvic Drain After Rectal Resection for Mid-low Rectal Cancer
This RCT aims at assessing the effects of a pelvic drain after total mesorectal excision for mid-low rectal cancer on the rates of pelvic sepsis and anastomotic leaks.
Rectal Cancer
PROCEDURE: Pelvic drain|OTHER: No pelvic drain is placed
Number of participants with pelvic sepsis, anastomotic leak or pelvic collections clinically or radiologically detected, 0-30 days postoperatively
Management of pelvic sepsis, Type of management (medical, rediological, surgical), 0-30 days postoperatively|Postoperative complications, Overall postoperative complications, 0-30 days postoperatively|CT scan or imaging needed, Necessity of performing unscheduled imaging tests, 0-30 days postoperatively|Number of participants with postoperative ileus, Postoperative ileus, 0-30 days postoperatively|Diagnostic delay for a leak, Days between surgery and leak detection, 0-30 days postoperatively|Length of postperative stay, Days of stay after surgery, 0-30 days postoperatively or until discharge|Time to flatus and bowel movement, Days between surgery and flatus/faeces, 0-30 days postoperatively|Stoma presence at 1-year follow-up, Necessity of maintaining the diverting ileostomy at 1-year follow-up, 12 months after surgery|Late pelvic collections, Presence of pelvic collections detected at longer follow-up intervals, up to 60 days after surgery|Small bowel obstruction, Mechanical small bowel obstruction, up to 60 days after surgery|Quality of life associated with a drain, Visual Analogue Scale 0-10 (higher score means better outcome) score of postoperative pain and wound complaints, 30 days postoperatively|Any complications associated with drain removal after surgery, Safety of drain removal after surgery, up to 60 days after surgery
This is a 2-arm, non-inferiority RCT. Patients undergoing total mesorectal excision for mid-low rectal cancer will be randomly assigned into two groups:

* pelvic drain
* no pelvic drain. Patients will be followed-up to assess the rates of anastomotic leaks, pelvic sepsis and secondary outcomes.
