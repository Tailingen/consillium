First-in-Human Study of RLY-5836 in Advanced Breast Cancer and Other Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1, first-in-human, open-label study designed to evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of RLY-5836 in advanced solid tumors in participants harboring a PIK3CA mutation in blood and/or tumor per local assessment. The study consists of 2 parts, a dose escalation (Part 1) and a dose expansion (Part 2).
