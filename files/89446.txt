Pancreaticogastrostomy Versus Pancreaticojejunostomy With Dunking Technique After Pancreaticodudenectomy: A Prospective Randomized Comparative Study
To compare between the outcomes of pancreaticogastrostomy and pancreaticojejunostomy with dunking technique after Pancreaticodudenectomy in the treatment of operable periampullary malignancies.
Pancreaticobiliary Cancer
PROCEDURE: Pancreaticogastrostomy versus Pancreaticojejunostomy with Dunking Technique
Rate of postoperative anastomosis leakage, Compare between dunking in pancreaticogastrostomy and pancreaticojejunostomy and the rate of postoperative anastomosis leakage, One month
Pancreaticoduodenectomy remains the treatment of choice for periampullary malignancies. Advances in pancreatic surgery techniques and perioperative care have led to reduced mortality rates for Pancreaticodudenectomy \[1\]. However, morbidity after pancreatic resection remains high, with 30-60% of patients experiencing complications following surgery, mainly as a result of leak and subsequent fistula from the pancreatic anastomosis \[2\].The leakage of the pancreatic anastomosis remains the most serious problem as it is the major cause of morbidity after pancreaticoduodenectomy, and also contributes significantly to prolonged hospitalization \[5\]. For this reason, surgeons have always directed their efforts at reducing the rate of pancreatic fistula through the introduction of new and effective methods of construction of the pancreatic anastomosis \[6\]. Various techniques have been described for joining the pancreatic stump either with the jejunum or with the stomach, with or without internal or external drainage of the pancreatic duct. Recently, new prospective randomized studies have demonstrated the advantage of pancreaticogastrostomy over pancreaticojejunostomy in reducing the incidence of pancreatic fistula \[3\]; however, none of these techniques has proved to be superior in minimizing postoperative mortality and morbidity \[4\]. One of the difficulties of pancreatic reconstruction after pancreaticoduodenectomy is the presence of soft pancreas which leads to high risk of fistula so dunking technique was raised \[8\]. But few researches or papers have focused on its efficacy and even fewer papers have discussed dunking in pancreaticogastrostomy and pancreaticojejunostomy, So this is the interest of our study to compare between the efficacies of these two techniques.
