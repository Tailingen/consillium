Study of M200 (Volociximab) in Patients With Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)
This clinical trial is being conducted to determine tumor response and preliminary safety of a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to a cell surface receptor (α5β1 integrin) and is required for the establishment of new blood vessels during tumor growth, a process known as angiogenesis.
