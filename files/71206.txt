Study of Pemetrexed Plus Cisplatin as First-line Therapy in Patients With Advanced Non-squamous NSCLC
This is a study of pemetrexed disodium plus cisplatin as first-line therapy in patients with advanced non-squamous cell lung cancer. This is a phase IIA pharmacogenomic trial.
Carcinoma, Non Small Cell Lung
DRUG: Pemetrexed/Cisplatin
Objective Response Rate, The percentage of patients who have experienced a tumor response since the start of treatment. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR, From start of treatment to end of follow up, up to 24 months
Overall Survival, Overall survival is measured from the date of enrollment to the date of death from any cause, From the date of enrollment until end of follow up, up to 24 months.|Time to Progression, This interval is measured in months from the date of entry into the study until the first date of the appearance of new metastatic lesions or objective progression of the disease. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions, From the date of enrollment until end of follow up, up to 24 months.|Time to Progression of Patients According the Results of Biomarker BRCA1, This interval is measured from the date of entry into the study until the first date of the appearance of new metastatic lesions or objective progression of the disease for patients with biomarker BRCA1., From the date of enrollment until end of follow up, up to 24 months.|Time to Progression of Patients According the Results of Biomarker RAP80, This interval is measured from the date of entry into the study until the first date of the appearance of new metastatic lesions or objective progression of the disease., From the date of enrollment until end of follow up, up to 24 months.|Time to Progression of Patients According the Results of Biomarker TS, This interval is measured from the date of entry into the study until the first date of the appearance of new metastatic lesions or objective progression of the disease., From the date of enrollment until end of follow up, up to 24 months.|Overall Survival of Patients According the Results of Biomarker BRCA1, Overall survival is measured from the date of enrollment to the date of death from any cause, From the date of enrollment until end of follow up, up to 24 months.|Overall Survival of Patients According the Results of Biomarker RAP80, Overall survival is measured from the date of enrollment to the date of death from any cause, From the date of enrollment until end of follow up, up to 24 months.|Overall Survival of Patients According the Results of Biomarker TS, Overall survival is measured from the date of enrollment to the date of death from any cause., From the date of enrollment until end of follow up, up to 24 months.
This is a non-randomized, phase IIA pharmacogenomic, open label, uncontrolled, efficacy study in patients with advanced non-squamous cell lung cancer as a first line therapy.
