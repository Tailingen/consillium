Secondary Cytoreductive Surgery and Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) for Recurrent Mucinous Ovarian Cancer (HI-MOC Study)
The primary objective is to estimate overall survival after secondary cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC for women with recurrent primary mucinous ovarian cancer
Ovarian Cancer
OTHER: Cytoreductive surgery
To estimate progression-free survival (PFS) after secondary cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC for women with recurrent primary mucinous ovarian cancer, through study completion, an average of 6 years (patients will be followed for 6 years after treatment completion
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

The primary objective is to estimate progression-free survival (PFS) after secondary cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC for women with recurrent primary mucinous ovarian cancer

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

* To estimate overall survival (OS) after secondary cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC for women with recurrent primary mucinous ovarian cancer
* To evaluate toxicity and morbidity of secondary cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC for women with recurrent primary mucinous ovarian cancer
* To estimate quality of life after secondary cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC for women with recurrent primary mucinous ovarian cancer
* To estimate what proportion of patients who preoperatively appear to be candidates for secondary cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC are found to have unresectable disease at time of surgical exploration
* To collect blood and tumor samples for biobanking to be used for exploratory endpoints
