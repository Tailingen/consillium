Itacitinib in Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This research will assess the effects of Itacitinib as a second line treatment for patients with advanced inflammatory hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a type of liver cancer. Itacinib is a protein inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase, JAK1, which is believed to enable cancer cells to metastasise to other parts of the body.

JAKaL is a single arm phase Ib study evaluating the effect of Itacitinib in 25 patients with advanced HCC.

Many patients diagnosed with HCC will have advanced disease where only palliative care is offered to them, this could account for the relatively low reported 5-year survival rate of approximately 10%. There are a number of epidemiological and pre-clinical studies that have investigated the role of chronic inflammatory conditions in the development of HCC and these provide evidence that inflammation promotes malignant transformation. The production of tumour-promoting cytokines by inflammatory cells can activate transcription factors, such as STAT3 via the JAK/STAT pathway in premalignant cells. STAT3, once activated, can cause the expression of further genes necessary for cell activation, localisation, survival and proliferation. Inhibition of JAK could therefore be a way of directly affecting malignant cell proliferation, as STAT3 in most malignancies are persistently phosphorylated and thereby stimulated to carry out its function; to sustain cell proliferation and block apoptosis.

For reference, STAT3 is a member of the STAT protein family and is switched on, via phosphorylation, by receptor-associated Janus kinases (JAK), a type of tyrosine kinase, and together they form homo-/heterodimers that translocate to the cell nucleus and act as transcription activators. STAT3 mediates the expression of a variety of genes and therefore is integral to many cellular processes, as mentioned above, such as cell growth and apoptosis, and thus they can promote oncogenesis by being over-active in the different signalling pathways it is involved in.

Itacitinib has not yet been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for any clinical indication but has been developed as potential treatments for myelofibrosis (MF), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), B cell malignancies and solid tumours like HCC. It is a small molecule selective inhibitor of JAK1 thereby preventing its phosphorylation of STAT proteins, particularly STAT3, resulting in a decrease in the expression of genes responsible for cell activation, localisation, survival and proliferation
