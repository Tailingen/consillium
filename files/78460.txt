Bacterial Ecology of Pilonidal Cysts
Bacterial ecology of pilonidal cysts Single centre retrospective exploratory study of medical data contained in the medical records of patients operated on in the centre between 01/08/2020 and 30/11/2020.
Pilonidal Cysts
Main germs incidence rate, Calculation of the the incidence rates of the main germs, Day 1
From the medical records of a series of patients treated for pilonidal cysts:

1. Describe the bacteriological analyses performed on a series of non-abscessed pilonidal cysts before laser treatment
2. Compare the bacterial flora of cysts operated on in the first instance and those reoperated on

This is a retrospective monocentric study of medical data contained in the medical records of patients operated on for pilonidal cysts and who received the same protocol:

* Antibiotic prophylaxis (injection of 2g of Augmentin)
* Treatment of the cyst by laser, under general anaesthesia, after dilatation of the pilonidal sinus, evisceration and bacteriological swabbing.
* Post-operative monitoring and local care
