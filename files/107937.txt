FLARE RT for Patients With Stage IIB-IIIB Non-small Cell Lung Cancer: Personalizing Radiation Therapy Using PET/CT and SPECT/CT Imaging
This phase II trial studies how well positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) and single positron emission computed tomography (SPECT)/CT imaging works in improving radiation therapy treatment in patients with stage IIB-IIIB non-small cell lung cancer. PET/CT imaging mid-way through treatment may be able to accurately show how well radiation therapy and chemotherapy are working. SPECT/CT imaging may be able to tell which parts of the lung tissue are healthier than others. Based on the result of the imaging, treatment adjustments may be made to the radiation therapy to improve survival and decrease toxicity.

Overall Survival (OS) Rate, Final statistical analyses of OS will consist of Kaplan-Meier estimation., At 2 years
Radiation Pneumonitis Defined as Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4 Grade 2 or Higher Pneumonitis, Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4, grade 2 or higher pneumonitis is defined as breathing problems after radiation treatment requiring medications for treatment (grade 2), oxygen use (grade 3), hospitalization (grade 4), or leading to death (grade 5). Clinical studies commonly report how many patients that develop pneumonitis as a result of radiation treatment, which is usually within the first 3 months after radiation., Up to 3 months|Local-Regional Progression as Defined by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) Criteria, Intrathoracic progression of lung tumors assessed by post-radiotherapy computed tomography. Progression will be defined by RECIST criteria. Final statistical analyses of local-regional progression cumulative incidence will consist of Fine-Gray estimation with death and distant metastasis as competing risks., At 1 year|Progression-free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival will be assessed by post-radiotherapy computed tomography. Progression will be defined by RECIST criteria. Final statistical analyses of PFS will consist of Kaplan-Meier estimation., 1 year|Change in Pulmonary Function-forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1), Pulmonary function tests (FEV1, liters) will be performed and change over time will be evaluated., Baseline to 3 months post-radiation therapy|Change in Pulmonary Function (Diffusing Capacity of the Lungs for Carbon Monoxide [DLCO]), Pulmonary function tests (DLCO, % predicted) will be performed and change over time will be evaluated., Baseline to 3 months post-radiation therapy
OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of radiation therapy.

Patients undergo functional avoidance radiation therapy during weeks 1-3. Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F-18 FDG PET/CT at baseline, 3 weeks, and 3 months post-radiation therapy and undergo technetium Tc-99m albumin aggregated (99mTc-MAA) and technetium Tc-99m sulfur colloid SPECT/CT radiation therapy at baseline and 3 months post-radiation therapy. Baseline PET/CT must be performed at University of Washington Medical Center/Seattle Cancer Care Alliance and be within one month of treatment start, therefore some patients may need to repeat a baseline PET/CT if their PET/CT is from an outside institution or \> 1 month old. Patients not responding to treatment at 3 weeks, will receive an increased daily radiation therapy dosage.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 years.
