The Effect of Astaxanthin on Oxidative Stress Indices in Patients With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy affecting women of reproductive age It is hypothesized that ∼20 fold increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in Follicular fluid (FF) and granulosa cells of PCOS women plays an adverse role in affecting the IVF success rate. Astaxanthin (3,3'-dihydroxy-β,β'-carotene-4,4'-dione) is a nonprovitamin A carotenoid classified as a xanthophyll and is found in high amounts in the red pigment of crustacean shells (e.g., crabs, shrimp), salmon, trout, and asteroides. It has been demonstrated that astaxanthin displays a wide variety of biological activities, including anti-oxidative, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory effects.

investigators aim to investigate the effect on Astaxanthin administrating on reducing of ROS in FF and induction of antioxidant response elements in PCOS women.
