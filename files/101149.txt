Trimodal (18)F-choline-PET/mpMRI/TRUS Targeted Prostate Biopsies
Prostate cancer is the first cancer in humans (25%). The most widely used tracer in oncology, the 18-Fluoro DeoxyGlucose does not allow the study of prostatic neoplasia. On the other hand, Choline, which is an amino alcohol, is involved in the synthesis of cell membranes and has an affinity for prostate cells. Its concentration is directly proportional to cell proliferation. The analogue of choline has the advantage of having a rapid and stable accumulation over time in cancer cells, with a rapid urinary excretion (4 minutes after injection).

The goal of this study is to assess the feasibility and the accuracy for targeting image guided prostate biopsy to detect prostate cancer after Imaging fusion of choline-PET/CT compared to 1.5T multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) with 3D-transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) .
