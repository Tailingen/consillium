Study of Chemotherapy-Free Induction Regimen for Ph+ Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia With Inotuzumab Ozogamicin (InO)
This research study will add an anti-cancer drug (called inotuzumab ozogamicin also known as "InO") to treatment for participants with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Doctors leading this study hope to learn if adding InO to standard induction treatment for Ph+ ALL will lead to quicker, complete molecular remission (where the disease is not detectable even with very sensitive testing techniques). The purpose of this research is to gather information regarding the effectiveness of InO in newly-diagnosed Ph+ ALL patients that have not yet received treatment.

DRUG: Inotuzumab ozogamicin|DRUG: Dasatinib|DRUG: Dexamethasone|DRUG: Methotrexate|DRUG: Vincristine|DRUG: Ponatinib|DRUG: Methotrexate for Injection|PROCEDURE: Allogenic Stem Cell Transplantation
Number of Participants Who Enter Complete Clinical Remission at 60 Days as Defined by Criteria Set By The International Scale, Complete clinical remission (when there are no signs of the disease) with a major molecular remission at 60 days as defined by participants who have a low ratio (less than or equal to .01%) of BCR-ABL1gene in their blood, according to criteria set by the International Scale for p210 BCR-ABL1., 60 days
Overall Survival, The length of time from when the participant first receives study treatment to their death (due to any cause) as assessed by the treating investigator. Participants will be followed for 12 weeks after the last dose of study drug, until any study treatment-related toxicities have stabilized, or until death., 36 months|Duration of Response, The length of time from the first documented complete response (participant shows no signs of cancer) or partial response (participant shows fewer signs of cancer) to disease progression or death. Partial/complete response will be assessed by bone marrow biopsies and blood tests., 36 months|Duration of Complete Response, The length of time from the first documented complete response (when participant shows no signs of cancer) to disease progression or death as assessed by the treating investigator., 36 months|Progression Free Survival, The time from treatment administration to documented disease progression or death from any cause as assessed by the treating investigator., 36 months|Disease Control Rate Based on Number of Participants Who Respond to Treatment After 3 Months, The disease control rate based on the number of participants who show a complete response, partial response or no changes in disease (stable disease) after 3 months as assessed by bone marrow biopsies and neutrophil/complete blood count tests., 36 months|Number of Participants with Complete Molecular Remission at 180 Days, Number of participants with complete molecular remission at 180 days as defined by the absence of a detectable BCR-ABL1 gene, according to criteria set by the International Scale for p210 BCR-ABL1. Complete molecular remission at 180 days will be assessed among participants who do not undergo allogenic stem cell transplantation after treatment., 36 months|Number of Participants With Documented Veno-Occlusive Disease After Treatment, The number of patients with documented veno-occlusive disease as assessed by treating investigator., 36 months
