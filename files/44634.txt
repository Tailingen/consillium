A Safety and Efficacy Study of Eltrombopag in Subjects With AML
The purpose of this randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study was to provide clinical safety and exploratory efficacy data on the use of Eltrombopag in adult subjects with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) receiving standard induction chemotherapy with daunorubicin plus cytarabine. A minimum of 120 evaluable subjects newly diagnosed with AML was stratified by antecedent malignant hematologic disorder and age.

Number of Participants With Any Adverse Events (AE) and Any Serious Adverse Events (SAE) as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability., An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, is an important medical event that jeopardizes the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition, or is associated with liver injury and impaired liver function., From the time the first dose of study treatment was administered until 30 days following discontinuation of investigational product regardless of initiation of a new cancer therapy or transfer to hospice|Change From Baseline in the Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF)., LVEF is a measurement of the percentage of blood leaving heart each time it contracts.
