Preoperative MPDL3280A in Transitional Cell Carcinoma of the Bladder
ABACUS is an open-label, international, multi-centre, window of opportunity phase II trial for patients with histologically confirmed (T2-T4a) transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. The trial aims to test the efficacy of preoperative MPDL3280A and will include extensive biomarker work on samples from these patients. Eligible patients will receive two 3-weekly cycles of MPDL3280A pre-cystectomy. Following cystectomy, patients will be followed up for safety, survival, and disease data.
Bladder Cancer
DRUG: MPDL3280A
Efficacy of MPDL3280A pre-cystectomy with respect to pathological complete response rate (pCRR), Pathological complete response rate defined as no microscopic evidence of residual disease in the bladder based on histological evaluation of the resected bladder specimen collected during cystectomy (post-treatment)., 2-3 months (timeframe dependent on delay to surgery)
Efficacy of MPDL3280A pre-cystectomy with respect to anti-tumour effects as measured by radiological response (RR), CT or MRI scan taken at screening and pre-cystectomy visits. RR is defined as a \>30% decrease in tumour diameter from the baseline scan., Approx 34 weeks (timeframe dependent on delay to pre-cystectomy visit)|Efficacy of MPDL3280A pre-cystectomy with respect to anti-tumour effects based on disease free survival (DFS), Disease and survival data is reviewed at post-surgery visits and at 1 and 2 years post-cystectomy., Up to 2 years post-cystectomy|Efficacy of MPDL3280A pre-cystectomy with respect to anti-tumour effects based on overall survival (OS), Disease and survival data is reviewed at post-surgery visits and at 1 and 2 years post-cystectomy., Up to 2 years post-cystectomy
MPDL3280A (also called atezolizumab) is an immune check point inhibitor which targets programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). Overexpression of PD-L1 prevents the immune system from eradicating cancerous cells as it blocks antigen recognition. MPDL3280A inhibits this interaction, allowing immune-mediated tumour cell killing.
