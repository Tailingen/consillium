AGS-1C4D4 in Patients With Advanced Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer
The present study will investigate the safety, tolerability and spectrum of side effects of AGS-1C4D4. As such, this study will characterize the dose limiting toxicities (DLT) and potentially the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of AGS-1C4D4 in patients with advanced HRPC.
