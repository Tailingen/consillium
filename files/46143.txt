Facial Skin Health Tracking Feasibility in Breast Cancer Patients
This feasibility study will assess if tracking objective and subjective facial skin changes over time is acceptable to pre and perimenopausal women undergoing chemotherapy and/or endocrine therapy for breast cancer. There is no intervention arm and no control group. Skin health will be assessed through the instruments described below, and subjective data will be collected with self-administered questionnaires.
Breast Cancer Female
OTHER: Skin health assessment
Percentage of compliance in each of the 4 assessment tools, defined as the percentage of patients completing all the scheduled assessments under each assessment tool. The percentage of compliance will be summarized and the associated 90% confidence interval reported. If the percentage of compliance is 80% or higher under each assessment tool, the study will be considered feasible., 3 years
Changes in skin health over the duration of the study (4 assessment points), Difference in skin health at each assessment from baseline will be calculated which will be divided by the standard deviation of the difference to obtain the effect size of the change at each assessment time post baseline, 3 years|Changes in body image / skin QOL at end of treatment compared to baseline, Skindex16 will be used to assess. Skin traits will be rated from 0 (never bothered) to 6 (always bothered). The max score being 96, the least being 0., 3 years
There are no studies objectively assessing changes to facial skin health in this population, but tools exist to objectively measure changes thus we have chosen to use those tools to measure skin health. Before embarking on an intervention study showing improvement in skin health and patients' self-image and QOL, we first need to see if 1) it is feasible to measure changes in skin health in this population and 2) if skin health does objectively change over the course of therapy.
