Vaccination With Peptides in Combination With Either Ipilimumab or Vemurafenib for the Treatment of Unresectable Stage III or IV Malignant Melanoma
The purpose of the study is to assess whether a vaccine containing a small fragment of the protein IDO, which may be present in cancer cells and cells of the immune system, is safe to use in combination with either Ipilimumab or Vemurafenib in the treatment of malignant melanoma that has metastasized.
Malignant Melanoma With Metastasis
BIOLOGICAL: Vaccine consisting of a peptide derived from the protein IDO
Number of Participants with Adverse Events during and after treatment as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability., Primary endpoints will be assessed according to CTCAE ver. 4.0, Ipilimumab+vaccine combination: Day 84. Vemurafenib+vaccine combination: Day 56.
Vaccine related immune response, Reactivity towards epitopes nested within the sequence of the peptide used for vaccination, will be assessed in T cells from peripheral blood, obtained at the specified sample times. Reactivity will be assessed using ELISpot technology, where secretion of interferon gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha is measured during in vitro stimulation with the peptide used for vaccination. In addition to this, combinatorial coding with fluor chrome conjugated HLA tetramers are used to enumerate precursor frequency of CD8 T cells specific for epitopes within the peptide sequence, Ipilimumab: Day 1 (before first treatnent), day 21, day 42, day 63 and at day 84. Thereafter every 12 weeks until progression or up to 104 weeks. Vemurafenib: Day 1, day 28, day 56. Thereafter every 28 days until progression or up to week 104 weeks.
