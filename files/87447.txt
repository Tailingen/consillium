Pilot Study of Skin Quality Improvement After Adipose-drived Stem Cell Transfer in Irradiated Breasts
The aim of this study is to evaluate the skin quality of using adipose-drived stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cell taken by automatic centrifuge for adipose-drived cell isolation system into irradiated breasts.
Breast Neoplasms|Skin Abnormalities
BIOLOGICAL: Adipose SVF cell|BIOLOGICAL: Normal saline
The change in the breast skin thickness of the pre and post SVF graft from baseline at 12week after procedure, The efficacy is assessed by breast skin thickness measured by radiologist using breast ultrasonography, change in the breast skin thickness from baseline at 12 week
10 participants who taken conservative mastectomy will be enrolled

1. Process

   * adipose tissue is obtained from the subject's thigh or abdomen
   * adipose-drived stromal vascular fraction(SVF)cell isolation using automatic centrifuge system
   * adipose-drived stromal vascular fraction(SVF)cell graft into the irradiated breast.
2. Duration of study

   * entire duration: approximate 30weeks
   * Follow-up period: 12 weeks
   * Enrollment period: 12 weeks
3. Study design - Randomized, prospective, pilot study
