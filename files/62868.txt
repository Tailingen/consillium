For patients with stage I/II NK/T-cell lymphoma, the sequence of radiotherapy and chemotherapy is controversial. Some studies demonstrated the advantage of upfront radiotherapy. Therefore, we designed this single-arm phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of radiotherapy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy with DICE regimen plus peg-asparaginase which was proved to be effective in NK/T-cell lymphoma.
