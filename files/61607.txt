Propylene Glycol-Free Melphalan Hydrochloride (Evomela) in AL Amyloidosis Patients
This is a single arm, open label study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of propylene glycol-free melphalan hydrochloride in patients with AL amyloidosis. Treatment will be comprised of propylene glycol-free melphalan hydrochloride administered intravenously at a dose of 70-100 mg/m2/day on Days -3 and -2 as conditioning prior to autologous stem cell transplantation.
Amyloidosis; Systemic
DRUG: Propylene Glycol-Free Melphalan Hydrochloride
Number of Participants With Renal Dysfunction, To determine the safety profile of propylene glycol-free melphalan hydrochloride in the conditioning regimen prior to autologous stem cell transplantation in AL amyloidosis patients, including adverse events related to renal dysfunction (was acute renal failure is defined as either a \>/=1 mg/dL increase in serum creatinine or a doubling of serum creatinine to \>/=1.5 mg/dL for at least 2 days.)., 100 days|Number of Participants With Cardiac Dysfunction (New Arrhythmia), To determine the safety profile of propylene glycol-free melphalan hydrochloride in the conditioning regimen prior to autologous stem cell transplantation in AL amyloidosis patients, including adverse events related to cardiac dysfunction (new arrhythmia)., 100 days
Neutrophil Engraftment, time to neutrophil engraftment, 3 weeks|Platelet Engraftment, Assess time to platelet engraftment, 100 days|Treatment Related Mortality, Number of patients who expire within 100 days of transplant, 100 days|Hematologic Overall Response Rate, Number of patients with response based on Gertz, Palladini criteria (below) Complete response (CR): Normal serum free light chain ratio,Negative serum and urine immunofixation electrophoresis Very good partial response (VGPR): Difference in serum free light chains less than 40 mg/L Partial Response (PR): \>50% Reduction in the difference in serum free light chains Stable Disease (SD): Meets neither criteria for CR, VGPR, PR or PD, 6 months|Organ Response, Number of patients with organ response based on Gertz criteria (below)

* Kidney: 50% reduction in 24-hour urine protein excretion in the absence of progressive renal insufficiency (defined as a 25% increase in serum creatinine, as long as that is \> to an absolute increase of 0.5 mg/dL). In the case of nephrotic syndrome: a decrease in proteinuria to \< 1g/24h and an improvement in one of 2 extrarenal features - normalization of serum albumin or resolution of edema and/or discontinuation of diuretics in response to improvement in edema.
* Heart: ≥ 2 mm reduction in the interventricular septal (IVS) thickness by echocardiogram, improvement of ejection fraction by ≥ 20% (echocardiogram must be performed at the same institution), or decrease in 2 NYHA classes without increase in diuretic need., 12 months|Participants With Peri-transplant Hospitalizations, Number of participants with peri-transplant hospitalizations, 100 days
After giving written informed consent, subjects will be evaluated for eligibility for enrollment in the study. Baseline evaluations will be performed as outlined in Section 7. Subjects who satisfy all inclusion and exclusion criteria will begin the study drug. Subjects will be monitored from the time of the medication administration until discharge from the transplant program for safety. Organ function and hematologic status will also be measured at 6 and 12 month follow-up visits.

Standard response criteria for AL amyloidosis hematologic and organ response will be used. Overall response rate will be measured and participants will be categorized into complete response, very good partial response, partial response and progressive disease. Progression free survival, organ response, and safety and tolerability of propylene glycol-free melphalan hydrochloride will be assessed.
