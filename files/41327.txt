The global spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) is affecting cancer patients and their treatments. Cancer patients are among those at high risk of developing serious illness from an infection because their immune systems are often weakened by cancer and its treatments. Due to the growing coronavirus outbreak, patients clinic visits are being cancelled and many are facing social isolation and strict restrictions on their daily lives. We want to evaluate the impact of the coronavirus on the patient's well-being and their cancer care by assessing the delays in their medical care and any other unmet needs. We have created a survey that is available online for any patient with cancer to fill out voluntarily regarding their experiences to date.
