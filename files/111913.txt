A Phase III Study of YL201 in Relapsed Small Cell Lung Cancer
This study was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of YL201 with Topotecan Hydrochloride in subjects with relapsed small cell lung cancer (SCLC).
Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: YL201|DRUG: topotecan hydrochloride for injection
To compare the OS of YL201 versus topotecan hydrochloride in subjects with relapsed SCLC., (OS) defined as the time interval from the first randomization to death due to any cause., Approximately within 36 months
To compare Investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) of YL201 versus topotecan hydrochloride in subjects with relapsed SCLC., PFS defined as the time interval from randomization to the first documented PD or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Approximately within 36 months|To compare Investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR) of YL201 versus topotecan hydrochloride in subjects with relapsed SCLC., ORR defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve a best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)., Approximately within 36 months|To compare duration of response (DoR) as assessed by the investigator of YL201 versus topotecan hydrochloride in subjects with relapsed SCLC., DoR defined as the time interval from the first documentation of response (CR or PR) to the first documentation of PD or death, whichever occurred first., Approximately within 36 months|To compare time to response (TTR) as assessed by the investigator of YL201 versus topotecan hydrochloride in subjects with relapsed SCLC., TTR defined as the time interval from randomization to the first documentation of response (CR or PR)., Approximately within 36 months|To compare disease control rate (DCR) assessed by the investigator of YL201 versus topotecan hydrochloride in subjects with relapsed SCLC., DCR defined as the proportion of subjects with a BOR of CR, PR, or stable disease (SD)., Approximately within 36 months|To evaluate the incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) of YL201., AEs are assessed based on NCI CTCAE v5.0., Approximately within 36 months|To evaluate the concentration-time data for YL201, total antibody, and payload, Approximately within 36 months|To characterize the PK parameter AUC, Approximately within 36 months|Characterize the PK parameter Cmax, Approximately within 36 months|To characterize the PK parameter Ctrough, Approximately within 36 months|To characterize the PK parameter CL, approximately within 36 months|Characterize the PK parameter Vd, approximately within 36 months|Characterize the PK parameter t1/2, Approximately within 36 months|Assessment of B7H3 expression level in tumor tissue and the correlation between the expression level and the efficacy of YL201., Approximately within 36 months|Assessment of the number of subjects who are Anti-Drug Antibody (ADA)-positive at any time and who have a treatment-emergent ADA, Approximately within 36 months
The primary objective of this study is to assess whether treatment with YL201 prolongs overall survival (OS) compared with treatment of topotecan hydrochloride among subjects with relapsed SCLC.

The secondary objectives of the study are to further evaluate the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of YL201, and the correlation between B7-H3 expression level and the efficacy of YL201.
