Vorolanib Plus Sintilimab for Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma After Failure of Prior Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors Based Combination Therapy
This Phase II trial assesses Vorolanib and Sintilimab for advanced renal cell carcinoma after previous therapy failure. Participants receive the treatment until disease progression, intolerable side effects, death, or withdrawal. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS).

DRUG: Vorolanib Tablets|DRUG: Sintilimab Injection
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival is assessed by investigators based on RECIST1.1, including disease progression or death from any cause., 3 years
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective response rate is the proportion of participates with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), based on RECIST1.1., 3 years|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival is the time from starting treatment to still being alive., 3 years|Adverse Events (AEs), Adverse events are the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, including type and severity., 3 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Disease control rate is the proportion of participates with complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD), based on RECIST1.1., 3 years|Duration of Response (DoR), Duration of response is the time from first response (complete or partial response) to disease progression or death., 3 years|Quality of Life (QoL) assessed by FKSI-19, Quality of life is assessed by FKSI-19, 3 years|Quality of Life (QoL) assessed by EQ-5D-5L, Quality of life is assessed by EQ-5D-5L., 3 years|Pain Score, Evaluate pain using visual analogue scale (VAS), range from 0 to 10, higher scores predict a poor prognosis., 3 years
This is a Phase II, multicenter, single-arm clinical trial designed to assess the efficacy and safety of Vorolanib in combination with Sintilimab in treating advanced renal cell carcinoma following the failure of prior immune checkpoint inhibitors based combination therapy. Participants will continue to receive Vorolanib and Sintilimab until disease progression, development of unacceptable toxic effects, death, or if the physician or patient decides to withdraw from the study. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS) according to RECIST v1.1 criteria as evaluated by the investigators.
