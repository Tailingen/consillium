The Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics, Safety and Tolerability of ZL-2306 (Niraparib) in Patients With Ovarian Cancer
Niraparib is a potent and highly selective PARP-1/-2 inhibitor. The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of ZL-2306 (niraparib) and its metabolite M1 in patients from Mainland China with ovarian cancer, following a single and multiple oral administration of the study drug at the indicated dose (300mg, 200mg or 100mg), once a day.
