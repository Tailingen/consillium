Enhanced Recovery Program After a Robotic-assisted Surgery (RAAC) of Radical Prostatectomy. PROSTA-RAAC
There are few published data on the benefit of Enhanced recovery program in radical prostatectomy in the management of localized prostate cancer. All the studies available on the subject are retrospective (1-3).

This randomized comparative study is proposed in order to compare in a homogeneous population (place and time) the interest of RAAC specifically in this surgery.

BEHAVIORAL: Follow-up patient program
postoperative stay of RAAC-type treatment, To assess the length of postoperative stay of RAAC-type treatment compared to standard treatment, during a robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy., 5 days
The implementation of RAAC programs in healthcare establishments would improve the quality and safety of patient care (functional development and rapid convalescence of patients and reduction in postoperative morbidity through active prevention of perioperative complications) and optimization of care costs for health establishments and for health insurance (reduction in length of stay and convalescence, reduction in postoperative complications). Its implementation requires a strong involvement of all the teams and a transversal and multidisciplinary coordination, specifically dedicated to one type of intervention. This approach must therefore show its effectiveness by specialty and then by pathology within the same specialty.
