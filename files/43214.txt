Safety Outcomes: Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) as assessed by treating Investigator/PI (MD), Longitudinal follow-up and analysis of the relationship with psilocybin-assisted therapy., Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Safety Outcomes: Suicidal Risk as assessed by Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), Assessment of suicidal ideations or plans. The measurement of suicidal ideation is based on five "yes" or "no" questions with accompanying descriptions arranged in order of increasing severity. If the patient answers "yes" to either questions 1 or 2, the intensity of ideation is assessed in five additional questions related to frequency, duration, controllability, deterrents, and reasons for the most severe suicidal ideation. Suicidal behavior is assessed by asking questions categorizing behaviors into actual, aborted, and interrupted attempts; preparatory behavior; and non-suicidal self-injurious behavior. A significant suicide risk is defined by suicidal ideation with intend and a plan as endorsed on item 5 on the C-SSRS within the past month at V0 or since previous visit later during the study., From enrollment up to 10 days after dosing session|Safety Outcomes: Delirium as assessed by Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) screens for a diagnosis of delirium via an assessment of the presence, severity and fluctuation of 9 delirium features: acute onset, inattention, disorganized thinking, altered level of consciousness, disorientation, memory impairment, perceptual disturbances, psychomotor agitation or retardation, and altered sleep-wake cycle., From enrollment up to 10 days post dosing session|Change in Global Quality Life Score as assessed by Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Palliative Care 14 (FACIT-Pal 14), Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Palliative Care 14 (FACIT-Pal 14) consists in 14 items, and subjects rate how they felt during the previous week on a 5-point Likert scale, At Baseline, and every visit post intervention (dosing sessions) from Week 1 to week 24|Change in Physical domain score as assessed by PROMIS Pain Interference Scale (PIS), The PROMIS-Pain Interference Scale (PIS) measures the self-reported consequences of pain on relevant aspects of a person's life and may include the extent to which pain hinders engagement with social, cognitive, emotional, physical, and recreational activities. We will use 8 validated items pertaining to social and emotional consequences of pain during the previous week, that subjects will rate on a 5-point Likert scale, At Baseline, and every visit post intervention (dosing sessions) from Week 1 to week 24|Change in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS A and D) Score, It is a self-report questionnaire consisting of 14 items, and subjects rate how they felt during the previous week on a 4-point Likert scale. The HADS consists of an anxiety and depression subscale (0-21 points each), and total scores can range from 0 to 42. Higher scores indicate more severe depression and anxiety., At Baseline and every visit pre and post intervention (dosing session) up to 24 weeks|Change in Life Attitude Profile - revised, Death acceptance subscale (LAP-R) Score, Life Attitude Profile - revised, Death acceptance subscale (LAP-R Death Acceptance) is a validated, self-rated 9-item, 7-point Likert scale assessing acceptance and anxiety about death, At Baseline, and every visit post intervention (dosing sessions) from Week 1 to week 24|Change in Challenging Experience Questionnaire (CEQ) Score, The CEQ is a validated instrument with 26 items rated on a 5-item Likert scale, characterizing psychologically difficult aspects of experiences occasioned by psilocybin, according to seven factors: grief, fear, death, insanity, isolation, physical distress, and paranoia., Immediately after the intervention, at the end of the dosing day|Change in Social Isolation Scale (SIS) Score, The PROMIS SIS-6 assesses perceptions of being avoided, excluded, detached, disconnected from, or unknown by, others. We will use the short form of the instrument consisting in a 6-item, 5-point Likert scale, At Baseline, and every visit post intervention (dosing sessions) from Week 1 to week 24|Change in Spiritual Domain Score as assessed by Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Spiritual Well-Being 12 (FACIT-sp-12), The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Spiritual Well-Being 12 (FACIT-sp-12) scale is a measure of spiritual well-being validated for use in cancer and widely used in palliative care research. The FACIT-sp-12 has subscales that measure faith, meaning and peace, which are broadly consistent with conceptual models of spiritual wellbeing., At Baseline, and every visit post intervention (dosing sessions) from Week 1 to week 24|Change in Spiritual Domain Score as assessed by Schedule of Attitudes toward Hastened Death (SAHD), The Schedule of Attitudes toward Hastened Death (SAHD) is a reliable and valid measure of desire for death among terminally ill patients. It includes 20 items that subjects rate as true or false., At Baseline, and every visit post intervention (dosing sessions) from Week 1 to week 24|Change in Spiritual Domain Score-Demoralization Scale (DS-II), It's a 3-point response, self-report scale comprising 16 items and 2 subscales (meaning and purpose, and distress and coping ability). The presence of baseline moderate-to-severe demoralization, as measure by a DS-II score â‰¥ 8, is necessary for inclusion in this study., At Baseline and every visit pre and post intervention (dosing session) up to 24 weeks|Change in Spiritual Domain Score Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ-30), The MEQ-3056 is a self-report questionnaire that evaluates discrete mystical experiences induced by serotoninergic psychedelics and is sensitive to detecting psilocybin-induced mystical experiences., Immediately after the intervention, at the end of the dosing day|Change in Caregiver- CarGOQoL Score, The CarGOQoL is a well-designed and well-validated 29-item, multidimensional, self-administered questionnaire assessing QoL of cancer caregivers., At Baseline, and every visit post intervention (dosing sessions) from Week 1 to week 24
The purpose of this research is to understand how psilocybin-assisted therapy may be adapted in the context of hospice care, in order to test its safety in people with terminal illness who experience demoralization, and to study how well it works to lessen symptoms of psychological and existential distress.

* This research study involves a combined drug and psychotherapeutic (talk therapy) intervention. The research study procedures include screening for eligibility, and study intervention including preparation, evaluations, one psilocybin session and follow up visits.

  * The treatment regimen consists of a single administration of psilocybin with a supportive psychotherapy including 2 preparation sessions and 2 integration sessions
  * The name of the study drug involved in this study is Psilocybin. Psilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic drug produced by more than 200 species of mushrooms, which is manufactured for medical use to control potency and purity.
* Participants will be followed for up to 24 weeks (approximately 6 months) after the study treatment. It is expected that about 15 people will take part in this research study.
* This research study is a Feasibility Study, which mean it is the first time investigators are examining psilocybin-assisted therapy in the context of hospice care. Psilocybin is an "Investigational" drug, meaning that the study drug has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a treatment for any disease. However, the FDA has granted psilocybin the status of "breakthrough therapy" in the treatment of depression and the investigators have permission from the FDA to use this drug in this research study.
