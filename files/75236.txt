The Biology of Claudin 3 in Primary Human Mammary Epithelial Cell Culture
The objective of the present study is to determine whether or not primary human mammary epithelial cells are competent for use in molecular studies of transepithelial electrophysiology focusing on the function of the tight junction protein claudin 3.

Human breast Tissue will be removed from mastectomy specimens and used as a source to generate epithelial cells for study.
