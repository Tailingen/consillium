Phase 1 Study of TG02 Citrate in Patients With Advanced Hematological Malignancies
This is a multicenter, open-label, dose escalation Phase 1 study.
AML|ALL|Blast Crisis|MDS|Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: TG02 citrate|DRUG: Carfilzomib|DRUG: Dexamethasone
Maximum Tolerated Dose, Maximum Tolerated Dose refers to the highest dose of TG02 administered that will produce the desired effect without unacceptable toxicity., 28 days
Safety, Safety data will include vital signs, ECGs, PE findings, clinical laboratory parameters, ECOG PS, AEs/SAEs and concomitant medications., 28 days|Pharmacokinetics of TG02, Plasma will be analyzed to determine TG02 concentration., 28 days|Clinical Benefit Response, Clinical Benefit Response is defined as the sum of all response categories for Overall Response Rate (ORR is defined as the sum of patients with sCR, CR, VGPR and PR) plus minimal response (MR)., 28 days|Overall Response Rate, Overall Response Rate is defined as the sum of patients with sCR, CR, VGPR and PR., 28 days|Progression-Free Survival, Progression-Free Survival is the time to disease progression or death, which is measured from the date of first study drug administration until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented or the date of death., 28 days|Overall Survival, Overall Survival is time to death, which is measured from the date of first study drug administration until the date of death., 28 days|Duration of Response, Duration of Response is the duration from first observation of response to the first documentation of disease progression, with deaths from causes other than disease progression censored. For the purposes of the calculation of the DOR, the date at which the response status was first observed rather than the date of confirmation is used as the start date., 28 days|Pharmacodynamics, Pharmacodynamic sampling may include whole blood and bone marrow at baseline and post-treatment for pathway determination if available., 28 days
This is a multicenter, open-label, dose escalation, Phase 1/1b study.

For Parts 1, 2, and 3 of the study, the primary objective is to determine the highest dose of TG02 citrate that can safely be given to patients with different types of hematological malignancy.

For Part 4, the primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of once-weekly dosing at the maximum-tolerated dose/ Recommended Phase 2 Dose of TG02 in combination with carfilzomib.

This study consists of four parts:

* Part 1: single agent TG02 in acute leukemia patients
* Part 2: single agent TG02 in multiple myeloma patients
* Part 3: TG02 in combination with carfilzomib in multiple myeloma patients
* Part 4: TG02 in combination with carfilzomib in carfilzomib refractory multiple myeloma patients.
