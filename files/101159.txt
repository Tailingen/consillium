Squamous Cell Cancer|Head and Neck Cancer
DRUG: Temsirolimus + Weekly Paclitaxel + Carboplatin
Phase II Recommended Dose for the Combination of Temsirolimus + Weekly Paclitaxel + Carboplatin., 2 years|To Determine the Objective Response Rate (CR or PR) After Two Cycles of Treatment With the Combination of Temsirolimus + Weekly Paclitaxel + Carboplatin as Palliative Therapy for Recurrent or Metastatic HNSCC, Evaluation of target lesions:

Complete Response - disappearance of all target lesions Partial Response - at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter Progressive Disease - at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since the treatment started, or the appearance of one of more new lesions Stable Disease - neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter since the treatment started, 6 weeks
