Evaluate Safety and Tolerability of RX001 in Patients With KRAS Mutant Advanced NSCLC
This is an open-label, dose-escalation Phase I study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of RX001 monotherapy in patients with advanced KRAS mutant NSCLC. Subjects aged ≥19 years with advanced NSCLC with KRAS mutations will be enrolled. Based on the investigator's judgment of the lung tumor location, RX001 will be administered as a single intratumoral treatment via bronchoscopy or CT-guided percutaneous injection. Additionally, after conducting safety, tolerability, and preliminary anti-tumor efficacy assessments for all subjects up to Week 12 (D84) following IP administration, the collected data will be reviewed by the SRC for a comprehensive evaluation. If the IP is designated for long-term follow-up studies, monitoring for malignant tumor formation and other SAEs specified by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS) will be conducted for a minimum of 5 years.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: RX001
Incidence of treatment-related serious adverse event (SAE) rate, Incidence of SAEs throughout the study

SAE: an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered "serious" if, in the view of the investigator, it results in any of the following outcomes:

Death or a life-threatening adverse event Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions A congenital anomaly/birth defect Any other important medical event that does not fit the criteria above but, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above, Observation for 12 weeks following a single dose
Objective response rate (ORR), \* ORR = percentage of participants with complete response + partial response.

* Complete response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions.
* Partial response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline diameters., Observation for 12 weeks following a single dose|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from date of treatment initiation to disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Observation for 12 weeks following a single dose|Target Tumor Size, Changes in the maximum length of the target lesion, Observation for 12 weeks following a single dose
Immune response assessment, Evaluate the formation of anti-AAV2 antibodies, Observation for 12 weeks following a single dose|Viral Shedding Profile Assessment, Assess the extent of vector DNA shedding in saliva, urine, feces, and other excreta following administration, Observation for 12 weeks following a single dose
