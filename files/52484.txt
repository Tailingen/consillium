Novel Skin Care for Immunotherapy- Related Dermatologic Toxicities
Notwithstanding the continuous progress in cancer treatment, patients with cancer still have to cope with quality of life (QoL) - impairing complications. Especially an extensive spectrum of dermatologic toxicities has been associated with cancer treatments. The number and type of cutaneous toxicities have evolved over the past 50 years, paralleling the development of new immunomodulatory agents. The immunotherapy-related skin toxicities can significantly impede the patient's emotional, physical, social, and financial well-being resulting in a poor QoL. In rare cases of severe cutaneous reactions, treatment modifications are needed, resulting in a diminished overall survival.

Important organizations in the field of oncology and supportive care, such as the MASCC, the ASCO, and the ESMO, have developed guidelines for the management of cancer therapy- related cutaneous toxicities based on available scientific evidence. Still, for some interventions, the evidence of recommendation is moderate to insufficient. Therefore, it is essential to elucidate other new potential management strategies for dermatological complications of cancer treatment. Based on the previously mentioned supportive care guidelines for the ImmunoSkin project, two novel skin care products to tackle the cutaneous adverse events of immunotherapy have been developed.

The ImmunoSkin project general aim is to evaluate the efficacy of two novel skincare products to manage immunotherapy-related cutaneous toxicities.

General patient-, disease-, and treatment-related information, General and medical information will be collected through a short patient questionnaire in order to assess intrinsic risk factors (i.e., gender, age, smoking history, work habits, physical activity, skin condition, alcohol use, and medication use). Furthermore, information about disease- and treatment-related risk factors will be collected through medical records (e.g., tumor type and stage, tumor site, treatment type, dosing etc)., Baseline
