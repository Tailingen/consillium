Evaluating the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of ABT-414 for Subjects With Glioblastoma Multiforme
This study is evaluating the safety and pharmacokinetics of ABT-414 in subjects with glioblastoma multiforme.
Glioblastoma Multiforme
DRUG: ABT-414|DRUG: Temozolomide|RADIATION: Whole Brain Radiation
Number and percentage of participants with adverse events, Measurement by clinical lab results, vital signs, physical exam, and electrocardiogram (ECG), Every week for an expected average of 34 weeks|Maximum concentration of ABT-414, Measurement of the maximum concentration of ABT- 414 in the blood, Multiple time points in Cycles 1, 2, and 3 (4 weeks each) and Day 1 of remaining cycles until end of treatment, an expected average of 34 weeks|Number of Dose Limiting Toxicities, Measurement by clinical lab results, vital signs, physical exam, and electrocardiogram (ECG), Every week for an expected average of 34 weeks|Minimum Concentration of ABT-414, Measurement of the minimum concentration of ABT-414 in the blood, Multiple time points in Cycles 1, 2, and 3 (4 weeks each) and Day 1 of remaining cycles until end of treatment, an expected average of 34 weeks|Half-life of ABT-414, Measurement of the clearance of ABT-414, Multiple time points in Cycles 1, 2, and 3 (4 weeks each) and Day 1 of remaining cycles until end of treatment, an expected average of 34 weeks
Biomarker EGFR expression, Assessment of tumor biomarkers that may correlate with efficacy., At screening and post-study|Progression Free Survival, Progression Free Survival per RANO criteria is the length of time during and after the treatment of a disease, that the participant lives with the disease but does not get worse., Multiple time points in each cycle, throughout study, and survival information monthly until 1 year after last visit, or the participant becomes lost to follow up, or study termination.|Overall Survival, The overall response rate will be evaluated every 8 weeks at each assessment of disease according to RANO criteria, up to 28 months, Multiple time points in each cycle, throughout study, and survival information monthly until 1 year after last visit, or participant becomes lost to follow up, or study termination
