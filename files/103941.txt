Safety and Efficacy of Hectorol in Pediatric Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease Stage 3 and 4 With Secondary Hyperparathyroidism Not Yet on Dialysis
Primary Objective:

Evaluate the effect of Hectorol® capsules in reducing elevated levels of intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH).

Secondary Objectives:

* Evaluate the safety profile of Hectorol® capsules versus Rocaltrol® (calcitriol) capsules.
* Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D2 after administration of Hectorol®.
