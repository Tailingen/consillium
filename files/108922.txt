Grade 1: asymptomatic or mild symptoms, clinical or diagnostic observations only, intervention not indicated; Grade 2: moderate, minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated, limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily life (ADL); Grade 3: severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening, hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization indicated, disabling, limiting self-care (ADL); Grade 4: life-threatening consequence, urgent intervention indicated; Grade 5: death related to AE. Number of participants with Grade 1 to Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities were reported., Phase 1b/2: On-treatment period is defined as the time from the first dose of study treatment through minimum (30 days + last dose of study treatment, start day of new anti-cancer drug therapy - 1 day).|Pharmacokinetic Parameters: AUCτ After First Dose, This study included Asian participants with advanced solid tumors (Phase 1b) and global participants with 1L and 2L NSCLC (Phase 2).

AUCτ is area under the plasma concentration-time profile from time zero to the next dose (after single dose). (τ = X days, where X = 28 days for Q4W regimen and 42 days for Q6W regimen), Phase 1b/2: For the PF-06801591 300 mg SC Q4W arms, Cycle 1 Day 1, 8, 15, 22, Cycle 2 Day 1; for the PF-06801591 600 mg SC Q6W arms, Cycle 1 Day 1, 8, 15, 29, Cycle 2 Day 1|Pharmacokinetic Parameters: Ctrough After First Dose, This study included Asian participants with advanced solid tumors (Phase 1b) and global participants with 1L and 2L NSCLC (Phase 2).

OR was defined as confirmed best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST v1.1.

Complete Response (CR): Complete disappearance of all target lesions with the exception of nodal disease. All target nodes must decrease to normal size (short axis \<10 mm). All target lesions must be assessed.

Partial Response (PR): Greater than or equal to 30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target measurable lesions. All target lesions must be assessed., Phase 1b/2: Up to 30 months|Time to Response (TTR), This study included Asian participants with advanced solid tumors (Phase 1b) and global participants with 1L and 2L NSCLC (Phase 2).

TTR was defined for participants with confirmed objective response (CR or PR) as the time from the 'start date' to the date of first documentation of objective tumor response which is subsequently confirmed., Phase 1b/2: Up to 30 months|Number of Participants With Objective Response (Complete Response + Partial Response) Reported by Baseline Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) Status (High, Low, and Unknown), This study included Asian participants with advanced solid tumors (Phase 1b) and global participants with 1L and 2L NSCLC (Phase 2).

OR was defined as confirmed BOR of CR or PR according to RECIST v1.1. CR: Complete disappearance of all target lesions with the exception of nodal disease. All target nodes must decrease to normal size (short axis \<10 mm). All target lesions must be assessed.

PR: Greater than or equal to 30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target measurable lesions. All target lesions must be assessed.

PD-L1 expression was defined as the number of PD-L1 positive cells and/or qualitative assessment of PD-L1 staining on tumor and inflammatory cells in regions of interest that are defined by tumor cell morphology., Phase 1b/2: Baseline up to 30 months
