Study of Safety, Efficacy and Pharmacokinetics of CT-707 in Patients With ALK-positive Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a Phase I study of the ALK/FAK/Pyk2 inhibitor CT-707 in patients with ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer.

The purpose of the study is to determine the MTD/RP2D of CT-707 and evaluate whether CT-707 is safe and has beneficial effects in ALK-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: CT-707
Incidence rate of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) during the first cycle of treatment (Phase I), Maximum Tolerated Dose(s) (MTD(s)) and/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D(s)) of CT-707 in ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Cycle = 28 days, 28 days|Frequency of adverse events/serious adverse events, Characterization of the safety and tolerability of CT-707 as determined by changes in laboratory values and electrocardiograms, Up to 24 months
Overall Response Rate (ORR) - Phase I, Preliminary measure of anti-tumor activity of CT-707, Up to 24 month|Progression free survival (PFS) per RECIST v1.1 - Phase I, Preliminary measures of anti-tumor activity of CT-707, Up to 24 months|Duration of response (DOR), Preliminary measure of anti-tumor activity of CT-707, Up to 24 months
