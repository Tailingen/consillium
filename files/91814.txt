Safety and Preliminary Efficacy of MT-601 in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Lymphoma
This study is a Phase 1 multicenter study with a Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion evaluating safety and efficacy of MT-601 administration to patients with Relapsed or Refractory Lymphoma. The starting dose administered is 200 x 10\^6 cells (flat dosing).

DRUG: MT-601
Dose Escalation, To assess safety and tolerability of escalating doses of MT-601 by the number of participants with MT-601 Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) and Safety events (including but not limited to): treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), deaths, and clinical laboratory abnormalities per National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, Version 5.0), After 3 or 6 patients in each dose cohort have been treated with MT-601 and have had the opportunity to be followed for 28 days.|Dose Expansion (ORR), To assess anti-tumor activity of MT-601 based on Lugano Classification by the following endpoints:

* Objective response rate (ORR) defined as the proportion of treated patients who achieve a best response of complete remission (CR) or partial response (PR) per Lugano Classification.
* The Clopper-Pearson method will be used to estimate the two-sided exact 95% confidence interval for ORR., 12 months after the last patient treated in the Dose Expansion portion of the study receiving the first dose of MT-601.|Dose Expansion (DOR), To assess anti-tumor activity of MT-601 based on Lugano Classification by the following endpoints:

* Duration of response (DOR) defined for patients who attain a best response of CR or PR and is the time between the date of first documented CR or PR and the date of the first observed progression per Lugano Classification.
* DOR will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier (KM) product limit method. The median DOR and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) will be estimated., 12 months after the last patient treated in the Dose Expansion portion of the study receiving the first dose of MT-601.|Dose Expansion (CR), To assess anti-tumor activity of MT-601 based on Lugano Classification by the following endpoints:

* Complete remission (CR) rate defined as the proportion of treated patients who achieve a best response of CR per Lugano Classification.
* The Clopper-Pearson method will be used to estimate the two-sided exact 95% confidence interval for CR rate estimates., 12 months after the last patient treated in the Dose Expansion portion of the study receiving the first dose of MT-601.
This study is a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MT-601 in participants with relapsed or refractory (R/R) non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) or Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) who either relapsed or had incomplete response after cluster of differentiation (CD) 19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy or are CAR T cell therapy na√Øve (ineligible or refused CD19-directed CAR T cell therapy or for whom CAR T cell therapy is not available). The study will consist of two portions or phases: 1) Dose Escalation with allowance for backfilling cohorts (up to 50 participants) followed by 2) Dose Expansion at the preliminary RP2DS in 1-2 disease specific cohorts of up to 29 participants each. The Dose Expansion portion of this study will begin after completion of the Dose Escalation portion. The purpose of the Dose Expansion portion of the study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of MT-601 at the dose determined to be safe in the Dose Escalation portion.
