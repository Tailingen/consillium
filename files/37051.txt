Investigation of Potential Drug-drug Interaction of Volasertib With Itraconazole in Patients With Various Tumours
The primary objective of the present study is to investigate the influence of co-administration of itraconazole and volasertib on the pharmacokinetic profile of volasertib without co-administration of itraconazole. Secondary objectives are to investigate safety, tolerability and preliminary therapeutic effects following intravenous administration of volasertib.
