Gallium-68 NODAGA-JR11 PECT/CT in Neuroendocrine Tumors
NODAGA-JR11 is a novel somatostatin receptor antagonist, while Gallium-68 DOTATATE is a typical somatostatin receptor agonist. This study is to evaluate the lesion detection ability of Gallium-68 NODAGA-JR11 for the diagnostic imaging of metastatic, well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors using positron emission tomography / computed tomography (PET/CT).

The results will be compared between antagonist Gallium-68 NODAGA-JR11 and agonist Gallium-68 DOTATATE in the same group of patients.
Neuroendocrine Tumors
DRUG: Gallium-68 NODAGA-JR11
Standard uptake value (SUV), Determination of SUV for detected lesions and discernible organs of 68Ga-NODAGA-JR11 and 68Ga-DOTATATE scan., From right after tracer injection to 2-hours post-injection
Lesion numbers, Determination of lesion numbers of 68Ga-NODAGA-JR11 and 68Ga-DOTATATE scan., From right after tracer injection to 2-hours post-injection
Patients with histologically confirmed metastatic, well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors will be recruited in this study.

Each patient received an intravenous injection of 68Ga-DOTATATE (40ug/150-200MBq) on the first day and 68Ga-NODAGA-JR11 (40ug/150-200MBq) on the second day. Whole-body PET/CT scans were performed at 40-60 min after injection on the same scanner. Physiologic normal-organ uptake, lesion numbers, and lesion uptake were compared.
