Dexamethasone, Carfilzomib, & Nivolumab With Pelareorep for Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma
This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of wild-type reovirus (pelareorep) when given together with dexamethasone, carfilzomib, and nivolumab in treating patients with multiple myeloma that has come back (relapsed). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as dexamethasone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Carfilzomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. A virus, called pelareorep, which has been changed in a certain way, may be able to kill tumor cells without damaging normal cells. Giving dexamethasone, carfilzomib, and nivolumab with pelareorep may work better in treating patients with multiple myeloma.

Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of 4-drug regimen evaluated according to National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), A DLT is defined as one of the following toxicities:

* Grade 4 neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count \[ANC\] \< 500/µL) lasting 5 days or more.
* Grade 3 to 4 thrombocytopenia associated with bleeding requiring platelet transfusion
* Cardiac dysfunction: Grade \> 3 left ventricular systolic dysfunction or grade \> 2 myocarditis
* Any grade 3-4 treatment-emergent non-hematologic adverse event (AE) clearly unrelated to the underlying disease and considered to be at least possibly related to protocol therapy, Up to 28 days after cycle 1 start|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 4-drug regimen, The Escalation with Overdose Control (EWOC) design will be used to identify the MTD., Up to 28 days after cycle 1 start|DLT of 3-drug regimen evaluated according to NCI CTCAE version 5.0, A DLT is defined as one of the following toxicities:

* Grade 4 neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count \[ANC\] \< 500/µL) lasting 5 days or more.
* Grade 3 to 4 thrombocytopenia associated with bleeding requiring platelet transfusion
* Cardiac dysfunction: Grade \> 3 left ventricular systolic dysfunction or grade \> 2 myocarditis
* Any grade 3-4 treatment-emergent non-hematologic adverse event (AE) clearly unrelated to the underlying disease and considered to be at least possibly related to protocol therapy, Up to 28 days after cycle 1 start
Time to progression, Defined as the time from start of protocol therapy until the criteria for disease progression are met. Patients who are either lost to follow-up, die or who begin alternative treatments prior to progression, will have their data censored as of the date considered to be lost to follow-up, date of death, or the first day of alternative therapy., From start of protocol therapy up to 3 years|Progression-free survival, Defined as the time from start of protocol therapy to disease progression or death from any cause, censoring patients without an event at time of last clinical assessment., From start of protocol therapy up to 3 years|Overall survival, Defined as the time from start of protocol therapy to death, censoring patients who are alive at last follow-up., From start of protocol therapy up to 3 years
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Identify maximum tolerated dose of pelareorep in combination with other antineoplastic agents.

II. Identify whether the combination of carfilzomib and nivolumab lead to a safety profile different than what has been reported with either agent independently.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Assess the relative roles of immune-mediated and direct cytotoxic myeloma cell killing.

II. Understand the clinical benefit of nivolumab in programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) positive multiple myeloma (MM) cells.

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of pelareorep. Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 arms.

ARM 1: Patients receive dexamethasone intravenously (IV) on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16, carfilzomib IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16, and nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

ARM 2: Patients receive dexamethasone IV on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16, pelareorep IV on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16, carfilzomib IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16, and nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

ARM 3 (expansion cohort): Patients receive dexamethasone IV on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16, pelareorep IV on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16, carfilzomib IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16, and nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for a minimum of 4 weeks once off treatment or at least 100 days after the last nivolumab dose, then every 6 months after.
