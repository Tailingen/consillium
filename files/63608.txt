A Prospective Clinical Study on the Safety and Efficacy of Radiofrequency Ablation for the Treatment of Patients With Desmoid Tumors
This is a prospective study on the safety and effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation in patients with desmoid tumors.

In the study group, all patients after radiofrequency ablation of the tumor after 1 month will be evaluated using MRI and CT studies and, if solid components of the tumor are detected, repeated surgical treatment is performed followed by active monitoring after 1 month.

In the absence of a solid component, the effect is estimated by the volume of the necrotic process and monitored in dynamics every 3 months.
