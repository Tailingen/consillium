A Study of Dazostinag as Single Agent and Dazostinag in Combination With Pembrolizumab in Adults With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
The main aim of this study is to check if people with advanced solid tumors have side effects from dazostinag, and to check how much dazostinag they can receive without getting significant side effects from it when given alone and in combination with pembrolizumab. The study will be conducted in two phases including a dose escalation phase and a dose expansion phase. In the dose escalation phase, escalating doses of dazostinag are being tested alone and in combination with pembrolizumab to treat participants who have advanced or metastatic solid tumors. In the dose expansion phase, dazostinag will be studied with pembrolizumab with or without chemotherapy in participants with untreated metastatic or recurrent, unresectable squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN) and in combination with pembrolizumab in third-line or later recurrent locally advanced or metastatic microsatellite instability-high/mismatch repair deficient (MSI-H/dMMR) and third-line recurrent locally advanced or metastatic microsatellite stable/mismatch repair proficient (MSS/pMMR) colorectal cancer (CRC).

Number of Participants Reporting one or More Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Based on TEAEs Severity, A severity grade is defined by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 5.0. Grade 1 scales as Mild (asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated); Grade 2 scales as Moderate (minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental Activities of Daily Living \[ADL\]); Grade 3 scales as Severe (severe or medically significant but not immediately life threatening hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-care ADL); Grade 4 scales as Life-threatening consequences, urgent intervention indicated, and Grade 5 scales as Death related to Adverse Event (AE)., Up to approximately 68 months|Number of Participants with Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), A DLT will be defined as any of the TEAEs, but not limited to, those that occur during Cycle 1 and are considered by the investigator to be at least possibly related to dazostinag as a SA or in combination with pembrolizumab. TEAEs meeting DLT definitions occurring in Cycle 2 or later will be considered in the determination of the RDE of dazostinag, both in the dazostinag SA and the combination with pembrolizumab arms. Toxicity will be evaluated according to NCI CTCAE version 5.0., Up to approximately 68 months|Number of Participants Reporting One or More Treatment Emergent Serious Adverse Event (SAEs), Up to approximately 68 months|Number of Participants With one or More TEAEs Leading to Dose Modifications and Treatment Discontinuations, Up to approximately 68 months
Dose Escalation, Japan Safety Lead-in, and Expansion Phases: Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve confirmed complete response (cCR) + confirmed partial response (cPR) during the study in response-evaluable population. ORR will be assessed based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) version 1.1., Up to approximately 68 months|Dose Escalation, Japan Safety Lead-in, and Expansion Phases: Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve cCR + cPR + stable disease (SD) greater than (\>) 6 weeks during the study in response-evaluable population. The DCR will be assessed based on RECIST version 1.1., Up to approximately 68 months|Dose Escalation, Japan Safety Lead-in, and Expansion Phases: Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is the time from the date of first documentation of a cPR or better to the date of first documentation of progressive disease for responders (cPR or better). Responders without documentation of progressive disease will be censored at the date of last response assessment that is SD or better. DOR will be assessed based on RECIST version 1.1., Up to approximately 68 months|Dose Escalation, Japan Safety Lead-in, and Expansion Phases: Time to Response (TTR), TTR is defined as the time from the date of first dose administration to the date of first documented cPR or better by the investigator. TTR will be assessed based on RECIST version 1.1., Up to approximately 68 months|Expansion Phase Only: Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of first dose administration to the date of first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 29 months|Expansion Phase Only: Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of first dose administration to the date of death., Up to approximately 29 months|Expansion Phase Only: OS Rate at 12 Months, 12-month OS rate is defined as the percentage of participants who are still alive at 12 months from their first dose administration., Up to 29 months|Expansion Phase Only: OS Rate at 6 Months, 6-month OS rate is defined as the percentage of participants who are still alive at 6 months from their first dose administration., Up to 29 months
The drug being tested in this study is called dazostinag. Dazostinag is being tested to treat people who have advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

The study will enroll approximately 374 participants. Part 1 consists of an initial Safety Lead-in to Dose Escalation Phase; Part 2 and Part 3 compose the Expansion Phase in 2 specific indications namely, previously untreated metastatic or recurrent, unresectable SCCHN (Part 2) and third-line or later recurrent locally advanced or metastatic MSI-H/dMMR and third-line recurrent locally advanced or metastatic MSS/pMMR CRC (Part 3). Participants will be assigned to the following treatment groups in the respective Phases of the study:

* Part 1 (Dose Escalation Phase): Safety Lead-in + Dazostinag single agent (SA) \[Part 1A\] Dazostinag 0.1 milligram (mg) in the Safety Lead-in followed by Dazostinag as escalating doses (0.2 mg and above) in Part 1A
* Part 1B (Combination Dose Escalation Phase): Dazostinag as escalating doses (0.2 mg and above) + Pembrolizumab
* Japan Safety Lead-in: Dazostinag SA 5.0 mg in the Safety Lead-in± Pembrolizumab in Arms A and B. Additional dose levels of Dazostinag (such as 14.0 mg) in combination with pembrolizumab may be explored during the Japan safety lead-in considering recommended dose for expansion (RDE1) as 5.0 mg and dose optimization.

Once a safe dose is recommended from Part 1, participants of select advanced or metastatic solid tumors will receive dazostinag in below defined cohorts in the expansion phase:

* Part 2A (SCCHN Combined Positive Score \[CPS\] ≥ 1 Dose Expansion Phase): Dazostinag + Pembrolizumab\*
* Part 2B (SCCHN Dose Expansion Phase): Dazostinag + Pembrolizumab + Chemotherapy
* Part 3A (Expansion Phase in CRC): Dazostinag + Pembrolizumab in MSI-H/dMMR CRC
* Part 3B (Expansion Phase in CRC): Dazostinag + Pembrolizumab in MSS/pMMR CRC

This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this study is 68 months. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, including 30 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment. Participants in Parts 2 and 3 will be followed for survival for up to 12 months after the last dose of study drug.
