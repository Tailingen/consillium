A Phase I Dose Escalation Study of GSK2879552 in Subjects With Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
This study is a phase I, open-label study to determine recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and regimen for the orally administered lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) inhibitor GSK2879552, alone or in combination with All-Trans Retinoic Acid (ATRA). The recommended dose and regimen will be selected based on the safety, pharmacokinetic (PK), and pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles observed after the treatment of subjects with relapsed/refractory AML. The study consists of two parts. Part 1 will identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or RP2D using a dose-escalation procedure. Dose escalations will be guided by the Neuenschwander-continual reassessment method (N-CRM). PK/PD expansion cohorts will also be included in Part 1 to characterize the range of biologically effective doses by assessing PD markers and obtain additional PK data. Part 2 will explore further the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity of GSK2879552, alone or in combination with ATRA, at the RP2D in subjects with AML.

This study is a phase I, open-label study to determine recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and regimen for the orally administered lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) inhibitor GSK2879552, alone or in combination with All-Trans Retinoic Acid (ATRA). The recommended dose and regimen will be selected based on the safety, pharmacokinetic (PK), and pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles observed after the treatment of subjects with relapsed/refractory AML. The study consists of two parts. Part 1 will identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or RP2D using a dose-escalation procedure. Dose escalations will be guided by the Neuenschwander-continual reassessment method (N-CRM). PK/PD expansion cohorts will also be included in Part 1 to characterize the range of biologically effective doses by assessing PD markers and obtain additional PK data. Part 2 will explore further the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity of GSK2879552, alone or in combination with ATRA, at the RP2D in subjects with AML.
