Reduced CT + Anti-PD-1 as First Line Tx in Vulnerable Older Adults w/Adv <50% PD-L1 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
Evaluate frequency of adverse events that lead to chemotherapy discontinuation in vulnerable older adults with recurrent/metastatic PD-L1 TPS\<50% NSCLC patients who receive reduced dose chemotherapy in combination with immunotherapy.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer|NSCLC|Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer|Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Reduced Dose of Chemotherapy and Immunotherapy
Occurrence of chemotherapy discontinuation due to treatment-related adverse events, Evaluate treatment tolerability i by the number of participants that discontinue chemotherapy treatment due to treatment-related adverse events., Through completion of protocol therapy, up to 2 years
Response (complete response and partial response) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Evaluate overall response defined by complete and partial response in vulnerable or older adults with recurrent/metastatic PD-L1 TPS \<50% NSCLC patients who receive reduced dose chemotherapy in combination with immunotherapy per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, Up to 5 years|Overall incidence and severity of all adverse events assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0, The total number of AE's recorded for the protocol., Time of patient consent and throughout the duration of the study, including during the treatment period and for 30 days following the final dose of the study medication, up to 2 years and 1 month|Overall survival defined as the time from the date of first study treatment until the date of death. Overall survival (OS) will be censored on the last date a participant was known to be alive, Overall survival of participants measured in days., Up to 5 years|Progression-free survival (PFS) measured from the date of first study treatment until the date of documented disease progression, Evaluate progression-free survival of participants in days utilizing RECIST 1.1 criteria or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 5 years|Cancer related symptoms and quality of life, Evaluate impact of the reduced dose combination therapy on quality of life as measured by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC-QLQ C30). The EORTC QLG Core Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) is a 30 item instrument meant to assess some of the different aspects that define the quality of life of cancer patients.The functioning and the global QoL scales, a higher score indicates better health. Response options are on a 4-point Likert-type scale (not at all; a little; quite a bit; very much) and a 7-point Likert scale for global HRQoL ranging from 'Very poor' to 'Excellent'. The QLQ-C30 summary score is calculated as the mean of the combined 13 QLQ-C30 scale and item scores with a higher score indicating a better HRQoL., Baseline, Cycle 3 Day 1, Cycle 5 Day 1 Cycle 9 Day 1, EOT Visit (up to 2 years)
This is a single institution, single arm, open label phase 2 study in vulnerable or older adults (Age â‰¥70) with recurrent or metastatic, histologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma or non-squamous cell carcinoma of lung without driver mutation and PD-L1 TPS \< 50% to evaluate safety and tolerability of reduced dose of chemotherapy and immunotherapy.
