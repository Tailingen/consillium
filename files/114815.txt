SI-B001 Combined With Irinotecan in the Treatment of Recurrent Metastatic Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma.
This multi-center, open label Phase II clinical study is performed in patients with relapsed and metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma progressed on prior PD-1/L1 antibody with or without chemotherapy. This study is investigating the safety and efficacy of SI-B001 at optimal combination dose with irinotecan in patients.
