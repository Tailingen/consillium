Nedaplatin Versus Cisplatin in Treatment for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
To compare the effectiveness and toxicity of nedaplatin versus cisplatin in induction chemotherapy combined with concurrent chemoradiotherapy for locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
DRUG: Docetaxel, nedaplatin, fluorouracil|DRUG: Docetaxel, cisplatin, fluorouracil|DRUG: Nedaplatin|DRUG: Cisplatin|RADIATION: Intensity modulated-radiotherapy
Progress-Free Survival (PFS), Progress-free survival is calculated from the date of randomisation to the date of locoregional failure, distant failure, or death from any cause, whichever occurred first., 3 years
Overall Survival(OS), The OS was defined as the duration from the date of random assignment to the date of death from any cause or censored at the date of the last follow-up., 3 years|Locoregional Relapse-Free Survival(LRRFS), Relapse-free survival was defined as the time from random assignment to local or regional relapse, or death from any cause., 3 years|Distant metastasis-Free Survival(DMFS), Distant metastasis-free survival was defined as the time from random assignment to distant metastasis, or death from any cause., 3 years|Quality of life (QoL), Quality of life (QoL) was assessed using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire module for head and neck (EORTC QLQ-H\&N35). The EORTC QLQ-H\&N35 scale employs a 4-point response format ("not at all" to "very much"). Scale scores are transformed to a scale from 0 to 100 according to the EORTC scoring algorithm. For the functioning and the global QoL scale, a higher score indicates better health. For the symptom scales, a higher score indicates a higher level of symptom burden. Either English or Chinese version will be used according to patient's language habits., 3 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective Response Rate (ORR) were assessed with nasopharyngeal and neck MRI and flexible nasopharyngoscopy, according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid tumors(version 1.1), 12 weeks after the interventions|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Disease Control Rate (DCR) were assessed with nasopharyngeal and neck MRI and flexible nasopharyngoscopy, according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid tumors(version 1.1), 12 weeks after the interventions
This is a prospective, parallel, randomized, open labeled, phase III, non-inferiority clinical trial to compare the effectiveness and toxicity of nedaplatin versus cisplatin in induction chemotherapy combined with concurrent chemoradiotherapy for locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients in endemic area - nedaplatin, docetaxel and fluorouracil as induction chemotherapy regimen combined with nedaplatin as concurrent chemoradiotherapy (DNF-N) versus cisplatin, docetaxel and fluorouracil as induction chemotherapy regimen combined with cisplatin as concurrent chemoradiotherapy (DPF-P). All patients will receive radical intense modulate radiation therapy (IMRT). The primary endpoint is progress free survival (PFS).
