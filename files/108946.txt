XCELSIOR is patient-centric study for the registration of cancer patients, operations of a virtual tumor board, insight capture in clinical decision making, and collection of longitudinal, observational data in a cancer registry. Patient intake into XCELSIOR will occur through the Cancer Commons Web portal. This includes consent to participate in the data registry, including the collection and review of medical information by a Virtual Tumor Board, generation of patient-specific treatment options with supporting rationale, access to treatment access support services, and inclusion into a registry study that includes safety and efficacy outcomes tracking. Patients will be treated and tracked in their original treatment setting and the data generated will form part of a systematic framework combining expert judgment with artificial intelligence to maximize information gain and improve treatment option set development for individual cancer patients.
