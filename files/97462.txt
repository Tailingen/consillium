A Study of Remitoro in Participants With Recurrent or Refractory Peripheral T Cell Lymphoma and Cutaneous T Cell Lymphoma (All Case Study)
The primary purpose of the study is to investigate the incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) (ADR of special interest: capillary leak syndrome, infusion reaction, rhabdomyolysis, myelosuppression, infection, hepatic dysfunction, visual impairment/color blindness, ischemic heart disease/arrhythmia/cardiac failure, and severe skin disorders).
Lymphoma, T-cell, Peripheral|Lymphoma, T-cell, Cutaneous
DRUG: Remitoro
Percentage of Participants with ADR, Incidence of ADR, especially for capillary leak syndrome, infusion reaction, rhabdomyolysis, myelosuppression, infection, hepatic dysfunction, visual impairment/color blindness, ischemic heart disease/arrhythmia/cardiac failure, and severe skin disorders will be assessed. An ADR is defined as harmful and unintended responses to the normal administration/use of drugs, in which a causal relationship with the drug in question cannot be ruled., Up to Week 24
Percentage of Participants With Best Overall Response (BOR), Percentage of participants with a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on physician assessment will be determined. PTCL is evaluated according to revised response criteria for malignant lymphoma (Cheson, 2007). CTCL is evaluated according to clinical endpoints and response criteria in mycosis fungoides and sezary syndrome (Olsen, 2011). CR: Disappearance of all evidence of disease; PR: Regression of measurable disease and no new sites., Up to Week 24
The primary purpose of the study is to investigate the incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) (ADR of special interest: capillary leak syndrome, infusion reaction, rhabdomyolysis, myelosuppression, infection, hepatic dysfunction, visual impairment/color blindness, ischemic heart disease/arrhythmia/cardiac failure, and severe skin disorders).
