Drug-loadable（T-ACE Beads）for Hepatoma Embolization Therapy
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Radiopaque Microsphere (T-ACE Beads with doxorubicin) interventional therapy for patients with liver cancer
Cancer of Liver
DEVICE: Taiwan ACE Beads with doxorubicin
Patients Survival (Safety), Survival rate will be evaluated since treatment day until the date of death or final observation., An average of 12 weeks.|Tumor response in patients with hepatoma who received Taiwan ACE beads (TACE) microspheres embolization evaluated with mRECIST criteria, mRECIST criteria will be used to evaluate tumor response in patients with hepatoma who received Taiwan ACE beads (TACE) microspheres embolization., Three months
Serum Level of AFP, Collect Doxorubicin's blood concentration, 5 mL each time, An average of 12 weeks
The study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of Taiwan ACE Beads with doxorubicin used for chemoembolization for the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.

The investigators will study the overall response rates of lesions with Taiwan ACE Beads.

The procedure is similar with the other commercializing drug-eluting beads. At the target vessels, radiologists will inject doxorubicin with Taiwan ACE Beads instead of Gelfoam or PVA (polyvinyl alcohol). The end point of injection is also similar with conventional TACE.

Determine the complication rates, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) following Taiwan ACE Beads embolization.
