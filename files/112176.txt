Chemotherapy and Pelvic Radiation Therapy With or Without Additional Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With High-Risk Early-Stage Cervical Cancer After Radical Hysterectomy
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, paclitaxel, and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. It is not yet known whether chemotherapy and radiation therapy are more effective when given with or without additional chemotherapy in treating cervical cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying chemotherapy and pelvic radiation therapy to see how well they work when given with or without additional chemotherapy in treating patients with high-risk early-stage cervical cancer after radical hysterectomy.

Disease-free Survival (Percentage of Participants Alive Without Disease), Disease-free survival (DFS) is estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. The distribution of DFS estimates between the two arms is compared using the log rank test. DFS time is measured from the date of randomization to the date of first DFS failure (local, regional or distant metastases failure or death due to any cause) or last follow-up (censored). Analysis was to occur after disease or death was reported for 50 participants., From randomization to first failure (local, regional, or distant metastases failure or death due to any cause) or last follow-up. Maximum follow-up at the time of analysis was 12.8 years. The 2- and 4-year DFS estimates are reported.
Overall Survival (Percentage of Participants Alive), Overall survival is estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. The distribution of survival estimates between the two arms is compared using the log rank test. Survival time is measured from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause or last known follow-up (censored). Analysis was to occur after disease or death was reported for 50 participants., From randomization to death or last follow-up. Maximum follow-up time at time of analysis was 12.8 years.

Possible scores range from 0 to 16 with higher scores indicating a better condition. Analysis of covariance, using the baseline score as a covariate, will be used to determine if there is a difference between the treatment arms., Baseline and 12 months after the completion of concurrent chemoradiation (6 weeks)|Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Diarrhea (FACIT-D) Diarrhea Subscore at 12 Months, The diarrhea-specific subscore of the FACIT-D measures patient-reported diarrhea symptoms. Possible scores range from 0 to 44 with higher scores indicating a better quality of life.

Possible scores range from 0 to 60 with higher scores indicating a better quality of life. Analysis of covariance, using the baseline score as a covariate, will be used to determine if there is a difference between the treatment arms., Baseline and 12 months after the completion of concurrent chemoradiation (6 weeks)|Number of Participants by Highest Grade Adverse Event Reported, Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.0) grades adverse event severity as follows: 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe, 4 = life-threatening, 5 = death related to adverse event.

OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To determine if administering adjuvant systemic chemotherapy after chemoradiotherapy will improve disease-free survival compared to chemoradiotherapy alone in patients with high-risk early-stage cervical carcinoma found to have positive nodes and/or positive parametria after radical hysterectomy.

Secondary

* To evaluate adverse events.
* To evaluate overall survival.
* To evaluate quality of life.
* To evaluate chemotherapy-induced neuropathy.
* To perform a post-hoc dose-volume evaluation between patients treated with standard radiotherapy and patients treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with respect to toxicity and local control.
* To collect fixed tissue samples to identify tumor molecular signatures that may be associated with patient outcomes, such as adverse events, disease-free survival, and overall survival.
* To collect blood samples to identify secreted factors from serum and plasma that may be associated with adverse events or outcome and to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes from buffy coat that may be associated with a genetic predisposition to tumor formation itself or a response to cytotoxic therapy.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to planned use of brachytherapy (no vs. yes), radiotherapy modality - \[standard external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) vs. intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT)\], and radiotherapy dose (45 Gy vs. 50.4 Gy). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

* Arm I: Patients undergo standard EBRT or IMRT to the pelvis once daily 5 days a week for 5-6 weeks. Patients also receive concurrent cisplatin IV over 1 hour once weekly for 6 weeks.

NOTE: Some patients may also undergo brachytherapy beginning within 7 days after completion of radiotherapy.

* Arm II: Patients receive chemoradiotherapy as in arm I. Beginning 4-6 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Quality of life is assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Gynecologic Oncology Group (FACT-GOG/NTX4), FACT-Cx, and FACIT-D questionnaires at baseline; at the completion of chemoradiotherapy; and then at 6, 12, and 24 months after completion of chemoradiotherapy.

Blood and tissue samples may be collected for gene expression analysis by immuno-histochemistry (IHC) and for biomarker and polymorphism studies.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up very 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.
