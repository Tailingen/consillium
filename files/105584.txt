Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of KITE-439 in HLA-A*02:01+ Adults With Relapsed/Refractory HPV16+ Cancers
This study has 2 parts: Phase 1A and Phase 1B. The primary objectives of Phase 1A are to evaluate the safety of KITE-439 and to determine a recommended Phase 1B dose. The primary objective of Phase 1B is to estimate the efficacy of KITE-439 in adults who are human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A\*02:01+ and have relapsed/refractory human papillomavirus (HPV)16+ cancers.
Human Papillomavirus (HPV) 16+ Relapsed/Refractory Cancer
DRUG: KITE-439|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: Interleukin-2
Phase 1A: Percentage of Participants Experiencing Adverse Events Defined as Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), A DLT is defined as protocol-defined KITE-439 related Grade 3 events with onset within the first 21 days following KITE-439 infusion and which do not resolve to ≤Grade 2 events within 48 hours, ≥Grade 4 events with onset within the first 21 days following KITE-439 infusion, regardless of duration., First infusion date of KITE-439 up to 21 days|Phase 1B: Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who achieve a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as evaluated by modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1., Up to 1.4 years
Phase 1B: Duration of Response (DOR), For participants who experience an objective response, DOR was defined as the time from the date of their first objective response to the date of disease progression per modified RECIST v1.1 or death from any cause., Up to 1.4 years|Phase 1B: Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from the KITE-439 infusion date to the date of disease progression per modified RECIST v1.1 or death from any cause., Up to 1.4 years|Phase 1B: Overall Survival, Overall survival was defined as the time from KITE-439 infusion to the date of death., Up to 1.4 years|Phase 1B: Percentage of Participants Experiencing Adverse Events, Up to 1.4 years|Phase 1B: Percentage of Participants With Anti-KITE-439 Antibodies, Up to 1.4 years|Phase 1B: Percentage of Participants With Replication-competent Retrovirus (RCR), Up to 1.4 years|Phase 1B: Levels of E7 TCR T Cells, Up to 1.4 years
