Phase 2 Study of Carfilzomib in Relapsed and Refractory Multiple Myeloma
To evaluate the overall response rate and safety and tolerability of carfilzomib in subjects with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.

Patients must have received prior treatment with bortezomib and either thalidomide or lenalidomide and be refractory to their last treatment.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: carfilzomib|DRUG: carfilzomib
Best Overall Response Rate (ORR), For both A0 and A1, to evaluate the best overall response rate (stringent complete response \[sCR\]+ complete response \[CR\]+ very good partial response \[VGPR\]+ partial response \[PR\]) in patients with multiple myeloma who had previously received bortezomib and either thalidomide or lenalidomide, had relapsed after two or more therapies, and were refractory to the most recently received therapy, A0: Subjects evaluated for disease response on Day 24 of Cycles 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12. Onset of response measured on Day 15 of Cycle 1. A1: Subjects evaluated for disease response on Day 15 of Cycle 1, Day 1 of Cycles 2 through 12 and at End of Study.
Clinical Benefit Response (CBR) (A0 Only), sCR, CR, VGPR, PR, and minimal response (MR), Response assessments same as described in primary outcome measure|Clinical Benefit Response (CBR) (A1 Only), sCR, CR, VGPR, PR, and minimal response (MR), Response assessments same as described in primary outcome measure|Duration of Response (A0 Only), Duration of response (DOR) was calculated separately for subjects with clinical benefit response or overall response. DOR is defined as the time from first evidence of PR or better (for overall response) and MR or better (for clinical benefit response) to start of disease progression or death., Response assessments same as described in primary outcome measure|Duration of Response (A1 Only), Duration of response (DOR) was calculated separately for subjects with clinical benefit response or overall response. DOR is defined as the time from first evidence of PR or better (for overall response) and MR or better (for clinical benefit response) to start of disease progression or death., Response assessments same as described in primary outcome measure|Time to Progression (A0 Only), Time to progression (TTP) is defined as the time from the study entry (first dose of carfilzomib) to disease progression., Response assessments same as described in primary outcome measure|Time to Progression (A1 Only), Time to progression (TTP) is defined as the time from the study entry (first dose of carfilzomib) to disease progression., Response assessments same as described in primary outcome measure|Progression-free Survival (A0 Only), The PFS was defined as the time from the start of treatment to progressive disease (PD) determined by PI or until death., Response assessments same as described in primary outcome measure|Progression-free Survival (A1 Only), The PFS was defined as the time from the start of treatment to progressive disease (PD) determined by PI or until death., Response assessments same as described in primary outcome measure|Overall Survival (A1 Only), The time from start of treatment to death due to any cause OS was to be censored on the date the subject was last known to be alive for those who were alive or lost to follow-up as of a data analysis cutoff date., Patients were to be followed by telephone contact for disease progression and OS every 3 months after study discontinuation for the first year and every 6 months thereafter for up to 2 years
