Ph I/II Study of Subcutaneously Administered Veltuzumab (hA20) in NHL and CLL
The purpose of this study is to determine if a subcutaneous (SC) dosing schedule of veltuzumab can be established in NHL or CLL patients and to confirm the safety and efficacy of veltuzumab that was previously established when administered intravenously.

Safety/tolerability, safety will be assessed by monitoring lab results and adverse events, which will be assessed every 3 months for up to 2 years., over 2 years after treatment
The first study of veltuzumab given IV weekly in NHL patients (IM-T-hA20-01) has shown excellent tolerability and even efficacy at weekly intravenous doses as low as 80-120 mg/m2 over 4 consecutive weeks. These clinical results confirm experiments laboratory studies. Laboratory studies using Veltuzumab administered subcutaneously showed potent activity based on B-cell depletion. The current study's goal is to determine if a subcutaneous (SC) dosing schedule of veltuzumab can be established in patients with NHL or CLL
