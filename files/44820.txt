MVX-ONCO-2 in Advanced Solid Tumors
MVX-ONCO-2 is a patient-specific, cell-based, active immunotherapy where the participant's immune response to their own tumor cells is stimulated and/or increased. MVX-ONCO-2 is composed of a cell suspension of irradiated autologous tumor cells and two capsules loaded with allogenic genetically modified cells releasing an immunomodulator, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). MVX-ONCO-2 is an evolution of MVX-ONCO-1, which was approved for clinical investigation under the same category in a phase I and a phase II clinical trials. The objectives of the trial are to investigate the safety, tolerability and signals of efficacy of MVX-ONCO-2 in participants with advanced solid tumors.
