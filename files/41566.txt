Patient-Defined Treatment Success and Preferences in Stage IV Lung Cancer Patients
Our long-term goal is to integrate non-small cell lung cancer patient treatment preferences into clinical treatment planning.

Patient-defined "treatment success", In advanced stage NSCLC patients does patient-defined "treatment success" differ when both survival and patient preferences of adverse events are accounted for, compared to when success is measured solely by survival? And does it also differ based on individual patient characteristics?, Baseline|Patients' will to experience adverse events, Will the serious adverse events that an advanced stage NSCLC patient is willing to experience as part of his/her treatment differ after a real-life treatment experience, compared to before treatment?, Baseline
Summary score derived from patient preferences of adverse events, In advanced stage NSCLC patients, is a summary score derived from patient preferences of adverse events comparable to a real-life treatment scenario?, Up to three months
Physicians' will to select a treatment, Are physicians treating NSCLC patients more likely to select a treatment that matches patients' drug choices when provided standardized, detailed information on patients' preferences of adverse events compared to when they follow regular clinical practice?, Two years
The following specific aims are proposed:

Aim 1: Determine whether individual patients' preferences, characteristics, and treatment experiences affect the definition of treatment success.

Aim 2: Determine how to best predict real-life patients' treatment choices based on patients' preferences of adverse events.

Aim 3: Determine whether physicians are likely to change their oncologic clinical practice after receiving a detailed communication of their patients' preferences of adverse events.
