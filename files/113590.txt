Phase II Study of "VIPER" Chemotherapy in Rel/Ref DLBCL
Objectives

The primary objective of this study is to:

• determine the complete and partial response rates and the toxicity profile of bortezomib (VELCADE, formerly PS-341) when administered in combination with DICE chemotherapy plus rituximab (i.e. VIPER) to patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma

The secondary objectives of this study are to:

* assess event free survival and overall survival
* assess conversion of chemo-resistant to chemo-sensitive disease
* assess the ability to collect stem cells from patients treated with salvage VIPER who then undergo autologous stem cell transplantation
* perform correlative studies on pre-treatment tumor biopsy specimens; analyses will include the assessment of immunohistochemical expression patterns (germinal center B cell vs. activated B cell) and NF-κB activity
Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
DRUG: bortezomib, dexamethasone, ifosfamide|DRUG: mesna, cisplatin, etoposide, rituximab
Complete Response, Complete Response, 26 months
Single arm phase II trial of combination therapy bortezomib, DICE, and Rituximab in patients with relapsed and refractory diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL)

VIPER chemotherapy will be administered every 28 days at the following doses:

* Dexamethasone 40 mg IV days 1-4
* Ifosfamide 1.0 gram/m2 CIVI over 24 hours days 1-4
* Mesna 1.0 gram/m2 CIVI over 24 hours days 1-4 (mix solution with ifosfamide)
* Cisplatin 25 mg IV days 1-4
* Etoposide 100 mg/m2 CIVI over 24 hours days 1-4
* Rituximab 500 mg/m2 IV day 1 prior to start of DICE (375 mg/m2 for subsequent cycles)
* VELCADE 1.5 mg/m2 on days 2 and 5
