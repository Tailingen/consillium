A Dose Escalating Study of CD19/CD22/BCMA CAR-T Therapy in Relapsed or Refractory B Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma(NHL)
This is a single arm, open-label, dose escalation clinical study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of autologous chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells targeting CD19/CD22/BCMA in patients with relapsed or refractory B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

This is a single arm, open-label, dose escalation investigator initiated (IIT) study, the primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of CD19/CD22/BCMA CAR-T therapy in patients with B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). For the secondary objectives, pharmacokinetics(PK), survival of CAR-T cells in vivo, pharmacodynamics (PD) and efficacy in R/R B cell NHL will be evaluated.

This study flow comprises of a screening phase( ≤28 days prior to apheresis), apheresis phase (occur upon enrollment, ≤10 days prior to infusion), lymphodepletion phase (from Day -5 to Day -3) ,infusion of CD19/CD22/BCMA CAR-T cells on Day0, DLT assessments phase from Day1 to Day 28 and post-treatment follow-up phase (Day 29 and up to end of the study).
