Fruquintinib Combined With Chemotherapy as Third-line /Third-line+ Treatment in Advanced Colorectal Cancer
To explore the efficacy and safety of fruquintinib combined with chemotherapy as third-line/third-line+ Treatment in advanced metastatic colorectal cancer
Advanced Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Fruquintinib Combined With Chemotherapy
Dose-limiting toxicity(DLT), Usually refers to the highest dose at which a subject's probability of developing DLT does not exceed the probability of target toxicity during the regime-specified DLT observation period., up to 12 months|Objective response rate (ORR), CR + PR rate according to the RECIST version 1.1 guidelines., up to 12 months
Progression Free Survival (PFS), To assess the efficacy of Surufatinib Combine With Immunotherapy and Chemotherapy as second-line therapy to Advanced CRC, patients by assessment of progression free survival (PFS) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1)., up to 12 months|Overall survival time, OS was calculated from the date of pharmacy to death from any cause., up to 36 months|Assess the anti-tumor activity:DCR, Disease control rate (DCR):CR + PR + SD rate according to the RECIST version 1.1 guidelines., up to 12 months
Due to the limited efficacy of third-line treatment, the previously effective chemotherapy regimen is a new treatment mode. RE-OPEN, RE-OX and a Korean study confirmed that mCRC patients who had previously been effectively treated with oxaliplatin were retreated with oxaliplatin on the third line to help them achieve OS for 14.5 to 18.5 months. At the same time, a phase III randomized SUNLIGHT study showed good efficacy at the ASCO-GI Congress in 2023. The above studies show that the regimen of antivascular drugs combined with chemotherapy has a tendency to improve the survival of patients with third-line advanced colorectal cancer.

In order to further improve the efficacy of fruquintinib, we conducted a clinical study of fruquintinib combined with chemotherapy to observe the efficacy and safety of Third-line/Third-line+ treatment of advanced colorectal cancer, and to provide a more effective treatment plan for third-line and above treatment for advanced colorectal cancer patients.
