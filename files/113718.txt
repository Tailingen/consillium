Study of HL-085 in NRAS Mutant Advanced Melanoma
This is a phase I/II, open-label, dose escalation study to evaluate tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy in patients with NRAS mutant advanced melanoma .
Melanoma
DRUG: HL-085
Number of participants with adverse events, Number of Treatment-Related Adverse Events as Assessed by CTCAE v4.03 during the study period, Duration of the study, estimated to be approximately 24 months.|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), The dose level immediately below the dose level at which â‰¥ 2 patients from a cohort of 3 to 6 patients experience a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), DLTs within the first cycle of therapy (up to 35 days)
Objective Response Rate (ORR) as measure of efficacy, Efficacy estimated as the Objective Response Rate (ORR) , which is the sum of Partial Response (PR) and Complete Response (CR) as determined by RECIST 1.1, Duration of the study, estimated to be approximately 24 months.|Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), AUC of HL-085 following single and repeated dosing, Duration of the study, estimated to be approximately 24 months|Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Cmax of HL-085 following single and repeated dosing, Duration of the study, estimated to be approximately 24 months|Time to maximum observed plasma drug concentration (Tmax), Tmax of HL-085 following single and repeated dosing, Duration of the study, estimated to be approximately 24 months.|Half-life (T1/2), T1/2 of HL-085 following single and repeated dosing, Duration of the study, estimated to be approximately 24 months.
