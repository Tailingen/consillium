Efficacy Comparison of Dostarlimab Plus Chemotherapy Versus Pembrolizumab Plus Chemotherapy in Participants With Metastatic Non-squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
NSCLC comprises of approximately 84 percent (%) of all lung cancers and is often diagnosed at advanced stage due to poor prognosis. Dostarlimab is an immunoglobulin G (IgG)4 kappa humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds with high affinity to programmed cell death protein 1 (PD 1), resulting in inhibition of binding to programmed death ligand 1 (PD L1) and programmed death ligand 2 (PD L2). This study aims to compare the efficacy and safety PD-1 inhibitors dostarlimab and pembrolizumab, when administered in combination with chemotherapy (pemetrexed, cisplatin and carboplatin), in participants with non-squamous NSCLC without a known sensitizing epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), or receptor tyrosine kinase-1 (ROS-1) mutation, BRAF V600E mutation, or other genomic aberration for which an approved targeted therapy is available. A total of approximately 240 participants will be enrolled in the study for a period of 5 years.
Lung Cancer, Non-Small Cell
DRUG: Dostarlimab|DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Chemotherapy
Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who had a confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) as their best overall response (BOR) recorded from the date of randomization until disease progression or initiation of new anti-cancer therapy, whichever is earlier based on blinded independent central review (BICR) evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 (v1.1). CR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes must be \<10 millimeter in the short axis. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters (e.g., percent change from baseline)., Up to approximately 20 months
Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death by any cause., Up to approximately 59 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS will be evaluated using RECIST v1.1 based on Investigator assessment and is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of progressive disease (PD) or death by any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 59 months|Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), A TEAE is any event that was not present prior to the initiation of study treatment or any event already present that worsens in either intensity or frequency following exposure to study treatment., Up to approximately 59 months|Number of Participants With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is an important medical event that may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the above outcomes., Up to approximately 59 months|Number of Participants With Immune Related Adverse Events (irAEs), The irAEs are events which may be severe or fatal and can occur in participants treated with monoclonal antibodies directed against immune checkpoints, including pembrolizumab and dostarlimab. While irAEs (eg, diarrhea/colitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, hypophysitis, adrenalitis, thyroiditis, severe skin reactions, uveitis, myocarditis, and hepatotoxicity) usually occur during treatment, symptoms can also manifest after discontinuation of treatment., Up to approximately 59 months|Number of Participants With AEs Leading to Death, Number of participants with TEAEs leading to death will be assessed., Up to approximately 59 months|Number of Participants With Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation, An AE is any event that was not present prior to the initiation of study treatment or any eventalready present that worsens in either intensity or frequency following exposure to study treatment. Number of participants with adverse events leading to discontinuation will be assessed., Up to approximately 59 months|Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Changes in Hematology, Clinical Chemistry, Thyroid Function and Urinalysis Lab Parameters, Blood and urine samples will be collected to evaluate hematology, clinical chemistry, thyroid function and urinalysis lab parameters., Up to approximately 59 months|Number of Participants With Abnormal Vital Signs, Number of participants with abnormal vital signs will be assessed., Up to approximately 59 months|Number of Participants With Abnormal Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status, Performance status will be assessed using the ECOG scale (Grade 0-4). Grade 0 indicates fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease performance without restriction and Grade 4 indicates completely disabled, cannot carry on any self-care and totally confined to bed or chair., Up to approximately 59 month|Number of Participants With Abnormal Electrocardiogram (ECG) Parameters, Participants were in a supine or semi recumbent position (about 30 degrees of elevation) and rested for approximately 2 minutes before ECGs were recorded. Clinical significance was determined by the investigator., Up to approximately 59 months|Number of Participants With Abnormal Physical Examination, Physical examination will include assessments of the cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurological systems. Height and weight will also be measured and recorded., Up to approximately 59 months|Number of Participants Received Concomitant Medications, Number of participants received concomitant medications were summarized., Up to approximately 59 months
