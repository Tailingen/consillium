Anti-Covid-19 Vaccine in Children With Acute Leukemia and Their Siblings
Mortality in case of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Covid-19) during acute leukemia (AL) treatment is around 30%, i.e. more than 10 times the one of general population. Severe forms are reported in children receiving chemotherapy for AL. However, the main risk, largely underestimated, is related to delay in chemotherapy administration in case of infection, leading to an increased risk of relapse. Therefore, it is justified to propose an anti-Covid-19 vaccination to these patients. Vaccination of siblings also seems necessary given the uncertainty regarding vaccine response in children with AL and given that household is the main source of contamination. The messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccine COMIRNATY® (BNT162b2) is already approved by health authorities for individuals older than 12. In immunocompromised children with AL, safety and efficacy data are unknown. The benefit/risk balance encourages to use the vaccine without health authority approval in children aged 1 to 15 with AL. Regarding household, parents are vaccinated for several months as standard of care, but vaccination will be proposed to siblings aged 5 to 15 years old in this protocol.

The primary objective of this study is to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of COMIRNATY® (BNT162b2) vaccine (two injections 21-28 days apart) in children with acute leukemia (1 to 15 years old) and their siblings (5 to 15 years old).

A secondary objective of the study is to compare the quality of humoral and cellular vaccine responses in children with AL and healthy children.
