CD30 is originally described as a marker of Hodgkin's and Reed-Sternberg cells in Hodgkin's lymphoma. CD30 antibody has been applied to treat lymphocyte derived malignancies. To explore the potency of CD30 in CAR-T therapy, this trial is designed and conducted to test the safety and effect of CD30-targeted CAR-T.
