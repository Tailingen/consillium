Effects of a Paleolithic Lifestyle Intervention in Breast Cancer Patients Undergoing Radiotherapy
The study aims to test the feasibility and effects of a dietary and physical activity intervention based on evolutionary considerations in an oncological setting.
Breast Cancer|Body Weight Changes
RADIATION: Curative radiotherapy|OTHER: Paleolithic lifestyle intervention
Dropout rate in the Paleolithic lifestyle intervention group, Used to measure feasibility. The intervention is rated as feasible if dropout rate is \<30%, through study completion, an average of 5 weeks|Longitudinal body composition changes, Measured on a bioimpedance scale (seca mBCA, seca Deutschland, Hamburg, Germany), through study completion, an average of 5 weeks|Change in vitamin D levels, Difference between final (average 5 weekks) and baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D level, through study completion, an average of 5 weeks
Change in beta-hydroxybutyrate levels, Change between baseline and final (average 5 weeks) beta-hydroxybutyrate levels, through study completion, an average of 5 weeks
A total of 13 breast cancer patients referred to our clinic for curative radiotherapy were recruited for this pilot study. The women were supposed to undertake a "Paleolithic lifestyle" (PL) intervention consisting of a Paleolithic diet and daily outdoor activity of at least 30 min duration while undergoing radiotherapy. Body composition was measured weekly by bioimpedance analysis. Blood parameters were assessed before, during, and at the end of radiotherapy. A control group on an unspecified standard diet (SD) was assigned by propensity score matching.
