PRECISE, a Study to Gather More Information About Bone Fractures and Survival in Castration-resistant PRostate Cancer (CRPC) patiEnts Treated With Radium-223 in Routine Clinical practIce in SwedEn
In this observational study researchers want to gather more information about bone fractures and survival in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients treated with radium-223 in routine clinical practice in Sweden. The goal is to estimate the proportion of new cases (incidence) of symptomatic bone fractures and to estimate the proportion of death occurred in years of observation time per person (person years). Radium-223 (Ra-223) is an alpha particle-emitting radioactive agent approved for the treatment of men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).
