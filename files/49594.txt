Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes And Low-Dose Interleukin-2 Therapy Following Cyclophosphamide And Fludarabine In Patients With Melanoma
This is a phase II clinical study for patients with metastatic (the cancer has spread to other parts of the body) melanoma. Patients will receive an infusion (given by vein) of autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). TILs are a type of white blood cells that recognizes tumor cells and enter them which causes the tumor cells to break down.

Prior to the cell infusion, patients will receive a two drugs cyclophosphamide and fludarabine to prepare the body to receive the TILs. After cell infusion, patients will receive low-dose interleukin-2 therapy which is an approved drug to treat melanoma. This study will see how useful this regimen is in treating metastatic melanoma.
