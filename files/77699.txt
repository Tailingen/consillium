Relations Between Pelvic Floor, Diaphragm and Trunk Muscles
The present study evaluates the functional relations of pelvic floor, diaphragm, and torso muscles, their variation and correlations with urinary incontinence while separately training physical characteristics of the mentioned muscles in men after radical prostatectomy.

PROCEDURE: Muscles exercises program
Effect of activation of different muscles groups on pelvic floor muscles strength, Pelvic floor muscles strength was measured in cmH2O, 6 months after radical prostatectomy.|Effect of activation of different muscles groups on pelvic floor muscles endurance., Pelvic floor muscles endurance was measured in seconds., 6 months after radical prostatectomy.
Urinary loss dynamics, Pad weight by grams during 8 hours pad test, 6 month after radical prostatectomy|correlation between urinary incontinence and pelvic floor muscles strength and endurance dynamics, correlation coefficient, 6 months after radical prostatectomy
During the last two decades, the connection between pelvic floor muscles (PFM) and abdominal muscles or diaphragm has been detected: PFM contract and relax during the inhalation and exhalation in pace with the diaphragm; the activity of the PFM increases with the increase of intra-abdominal pressure during forced exhalations or cough. The role of pelvic floor is essential for the synergy of diaphragm and abdominal muscles in maintenance of intra-abdominal pressure. According to the aforementioned physiological functional relationships, the investigators have postulated a hypothesis that diaphragm muscles training and abdominal muscles training could have similar effect as direct PFM training on pelvic floor muscles strength and pelvic floor muscles endurance measured using perineometer in men after radical prostatectomy.
