Calcium Electroporation in Patients With Cell Changes in the Esophagus
The aim of this first-in-man study is to evaluate the safety of calcium electroporation used in patients with Barrett's esophagus high-grade dysplasia through an endoscopic system.
Barretts Esophagus With High Grade Dysplasia
PROCEDURE: Calcium electroporation
Registration of treatment related side effects assessed by CTCAE V 5.0, This is part of a safety evaluation and will be registered by CTCAE into Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE), Day 0 to 6 weeks after treatment|Registration of treatment related pain through a Visual Analogue Score (VAS), Second part of safety evaluation which will be registered by VAS score. The VAS score is a scale with values from 0-10, where 0 is no pain and 10 is the worst possible pain., Day 0 to 6 weeks after treatment
The rate of patient's that have gained from the treatment, Day 0 to 6 weeks after treatment
After being informed about the study and potential risks, all patients give written informed consent. Thereafter, patient will get calcium electroporation with biopsies and digital photographs on day 0. We expect to discharge all patients same evening. Between day 3-7 an examination is followed by gastroscopy with biopsies and digital photographs. On day 14 the patients are followed in our outpatient clinic. 6 weeks after treatment the patients will undergo endoscopic mucosa resection (EMR) or endoscopic submucosa dissection (ESD) surgery and thereby the standard care of treatment for Barrett's esophagus high-grade dysplasia.
