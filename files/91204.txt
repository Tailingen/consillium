An Exploratory Study of HRD Score in Chinese Ovarian Cancer Patients Benefiting From PARP Inhibitor Targeted Therapy
This project intends to evaluate the sensitivity of different Homologous Recombination Deficiency (HRD) score to Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) by retrospectively analyzing the tissue samples of patients with ovarian cancer using PARPi, and to determine the cut off value of the HRD score algorithm suitable for the Chinese population, so as to provide evidence for the role of PARPi in ovarian cancer. The screening of the beneficiaries of maintenance therapy provides precise guidance and can be used as a reference for other cancer types.

Homologous Recombination Deficiency score, Optimize the Homologous Recombination Deficiency scoring algorithm to calculate the Homologous Recombination Deficiency score of each patient's ovarian cancer tissue, After the ovarian tissue is obtained, an average of 3 year
