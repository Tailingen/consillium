Effect of GM1 in Prevention of Oxaliplatin Induced Neurotoxicity in Stage II/III Colorectal Cancer
The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of monosialotetrahexosylganglioside (GM1) for preventing oxaliplatin induced neurotoxicity in colorectal cancer patients who received oxaliplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy.

Oxaliplatin is a key agent in the treatment of colorectal cancer. However, peripheral neuropathy markedly limits the use of oxaliplatin. Many drugs have been tried to decrease the development of oxaliplatin induced peripheral neurotoxicity, however, the results remain disappointing. This multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was performed to assess the efficacy of monosialotetrahexosylganglioside (GM1) for preventing oxaliplatin induced neurotoxicity in colorectal cancer patients who received oxaliplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy.
