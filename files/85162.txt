Brentuximab Vedotin and Lenalidomide in Patients With Relapsed/ Refractory T-cell Lymphoma or Hodgkin Lymphoma
This study is investigating the combination of Brentuximab vedotin and lenalidomide in the treatment of relapsed/refractory peripheral T cell lymphoma or cutaneous T cell lymphoma or Hodgkin lymphoma.

It is hypothesised that lenalidomide may augment the actions of Brentuximab vedotin in these patient groups. The primary objective of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of the combination treatment, which can be used in subsequent studies. The study will also investigate disease response and survival.

Participants will receive Brentuximab vedotin (once every 21 days i.e. 1 cycle) and lenalidomide (daily from day 1 -14 of each cycle) for a maximum of 48 weeks and will be followed for a subsequent 6 months after the end of treatment.

Determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the combination of lenalidomide and brentuximab vedotin, Maximum tolerated dose, dose-limiting toxicities of the combination therapy, and recommended phase 2 dose, in patients with relapsed/refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, CD30-positive Hodgkin lymphoma and CD30-positive peripheral T-cell lymphoma. The MTD is defined as the highest dose level at which the incidence of DLT was less than 33%., 70 weeks
Safety profile of the combination of lenalidomide and brentuximab vedotin, Toxicities measured using CTCAE V4.03., 70 weeks|Treatment intensity., Treatment intensity defined as the actual total dose received divided by the actual treatment period., 48 weeks|Objective response rate, Objective response, defined as achieving either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) at some stage from time of commencement of treatment until conclusion of period of follow-up (maximum 16 cycles of treatment followed by 6 months of follow-up), or until time of documented progressive disease (defined as clinical and/or radiologic progression)., 70 weeks|Cytostatic response., Cytostatic response, defined as achieving complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) lasting \>6 months from time of commencement of treatment until progressive disease (PD)., 70 weeks|Event free survival., Event free survival (EFS), defined as the time from commencement of treatment to date of early discontinuation of treatment due to toxicity, date of documented disease progression at any site, or date of death from any cause, whichever occurs first., 70 weeks|Overall survival, Overall survival (OS), defined as the time from commencement of treatment to the date of death from any cause., 70 weeks
