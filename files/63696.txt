NEOADjuvant Aromatase Inhibitor and Pertuzumab/Trastuzumab for Women With Breast Cancer
This is a prospective, single-arm, phase II study of 32 evaluable patients treated with NEOADjuvant Aromatase inhibitor and Pertuzumab/Trastuzumab (NEOADAPT) without chemotherapy for hormone receptor positive (HR+), \[i.e. Estrogen Receptor positive (ER+) and/or Progesterone Receptor positive (PR+)\] HER2+ localized, non-metastatic stage I - IIb breast cancer.

DRUG: Exemestane|DRUG: Letrozole|DRUG: Anastrozole|DRUG: Leuprolide Acetate|DRUG: Pertuzumab|DRUG: Trastuzumab
Evidence of Pathological Response, The presence of residual invasive cancer on hematoxylin and eosin evaluation of the complete resected breast specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes following completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy. Pathological complete response (pCR) is defined as the absence of residual invasive cancer., One year
Duration of Treatment, Median number of days between Day 0 (first treatment of trastuzumab and pertuzumab) and three weeks after the last dose of neoadjuvant trastuzumab and pertuzumab on treatment protocol., One year|Evidence of Radiographic Response, Change in dimensions (millimeters) of target lesions (along long axis) and non-target lesions (along long axis for non-lymphatic lesions and short axis for lymph nodes) as observed by Magnetic Resonance Imaging and quantified by modified RECIST 1.1 criteria., Assessed every 12 weeks up to one year|Measurement of Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF), Determination of cardiac function as measured by echocardiogram or multi-gated acquisition scan (MUGA)., Assessed every 12 weeks up to one year|Mammaprint Genomic Analysis, Mammaprint will estimate the risk level of the subject's tumor., One year or up to 3 months after definitive surgery
