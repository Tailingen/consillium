objective response rate(ORR), The rate of participants that achieve either a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR).Higher rate of ORR indicates better treatment effect., up to 12 months
Progression-free Survival (PFS), Time from the start of treatment to progression of disease or death.Higher rate of 9m PFS in statistic analysis means better outcome., up to 9 months|Overall survival (OS), Time from the start of treatment until death due to any reason.Increased rate of 12m OS compared to the other arm indicates more benefit from the treatment regimen., up to 12 months|Safety as measured by number and grade of adverse events, Summary adverse events according to NCI-CTCAE 5.0, up to 12 months|patient-reported outcomes (PROs), Patient-reported outcomes according to EQ-5D questionnaires., up to 12 months
