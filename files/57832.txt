Paperbacked pPRO data from up to a total of 100 patients from the cohort of PRAEGNANT are planned to be included in the Pepper I PRO study. Additionally 200 patients will be recruited in the web based ePRO cohort. The study duration per patient is at least 8 weeks. In cases of stable disease the study duration can be extended to up to 6 months with monthly PRO assessments, according to the attached visit matrix, taking approximately 20 minutes per visit.

The documentation at baseline should be performed during clinical routine with trained study personnel followed by remote self-reporting to minimize the patient effort. Pepper I will be conducted as sub-protocol of the PRAEGNANT trial.
