A Study of Bevacizumab (Avastin) in Combination With Chemotherapy in Participants With Metastatic Cancer of the Colon or Rectum
This expanded access study will assess the efficacy and safety of intravenous (IV) bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy regimens as first-line treatment of metastatic cancer of the colon or rectum. The anticipated median time on study treatment is approximately 10 months, and the target sample size is 40 individuals.
Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: 5-Fluorouracil|DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Irinotecan|DRUG: Oxaliplatin
Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events, An adverse event was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a participant who received study drug., Baseline up to approximately 3 years
Percentage of Participants Who Died, Baseline up to approximately 3 years|Duration of Survival, Duration of survival was defined as the time period from the start of first line therapy to death. Duration of survival was estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis., Baseline up to approximately 3 years|Percentage of Participants With Disease Progression or Death, Disease progression was defined as at least a 20% increase in the disease measurement, taking as reference the smallest disease measurement recorded since the start of treatment, or the appearance of one or more new lesions, or evidence of clinical progression and unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions (TL)., Baseline up to approximately 3 years|Progression-Free Survival Time, Progression-free survival was defined as the duration from the date of starting first-line therapy to the date of documented disease progression or death from any cause. Disease progression was defined as at least a 20% increase in the disease measurement, taking as reference the smallest disease measurement recorded since the start of treatment, or the appearance of one or more new lesions, or evidence of clinical progression and unequivocal progression of existing non-TL. Progression-free survival was estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis., Baseline up to approximately 3 years|Number of Participants With Best Overall Response, The best overall response was defined as the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). Progressive disease (PD): at least a 20% increase in the disease measurement, taking as reference the smallest disease measurement recorded since the start of treatment, or the appearance of one or more new lesions, or evidence of clinical progression and unequivocal progression of existing non-TL. Complete response (CR): disappearance of all TL and non-TL. If immunocytology was available, no disease was to be detected by that methodology. Partial response (PR): at least a 30% decrease in the disease measurement, taking as reference the disease measurement done to confirm measurable disease at study entry. Stable disease (SD): neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR or increase to qualify for PD., Baseline up to approximately 3 years|Mean Direct Medical Cost for Cancer Related Medical Care Utilization, Direct medical cost included cost of out-patient consultation and cost of hospitalization., Baseline up to approximately 3 years
