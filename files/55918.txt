A Trial of Low Dose Sulindac Combined With Eflornithine in Patients With Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP)
The purpose of this phase III study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of eflornithine and sulindac compared to single agent sulindac or eflornithine in reducing the number of polyps in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP).
Familial Adenomatous Polyposis
DRUG: Eflornithine plus Sulindac|DRUG: Eflornithine plus Placebo|DRUG: Sulindac plus Placebo
Efficacy of Eflornithine plus Sulindac compared to Eflornithine alone and Sulindac alone determined by change in the number of polyps 2 mm or greater in a defined focal area of the rectum or pouch at baseline and after completion of the study treatment., 6 months from the start of treatment.
Change in number of polyps 2 mm or greater in the distal 10 cm of rectum or pouch., 6 months from the start of treatment.|Qualitative change in overall colon/rectum/pouch polyp burden (number and size)., 6 months from the start of treatment.|Presence of high grade dysplasia or villous adenoma in any polyp resected., 6 months from the start of treatment.
