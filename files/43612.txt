Roll-over Study to Collect and Assess Long-term Safety of Everolimus in Patients With TSC and Refractory Seizures Who Have Completed the EXIST-3 Study [CRAD001M2304] and Who Are Benefitting From Continued Treatment
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety in patients with TSC and refractory seizures who are currently receiving everolimus treatment in the Novartis-sponsored EXIST-3 study and who are determined to be benefiting from continued treatment as judged by the investigator at the completion of EXIST-3
Tuberous Sclerosis Complex
DRUG: everolimus
Occurances of adverse events and serious adverse events, The patients will be followed continuously for tolerability (i.e adverse events, serious adverse events), Day 1 up to approximately 10 years
Percentage of patients with clinical benefit, At every quarterly visit (every 12 weeks Â± 2 weeks), the Investigator is required to confirm that the patients continue to have clinical benefit as per Investigator's assessment., Day 1 up to approximately 10 years, assessed every 12 weeks,
This is a multi-center, open label study to evaluate the long term safety of everolimus in patients with TSC and refractory seizures currently being treated in the Novartis-sponsored study EXIST-3 study and are judged by their parent study investigator as benefiting from the current study treatment. The study is expected to remain open for approximately 10 years (or until 31-Dec-2022 in the UK) from First Patient First Visit (FPFV).

Patients will continue to be treated in this study until they are no longer benefiting from their everolimus treatment as judged by the Investigator or until one of the protocol defined discontinuation criteria is met or everolimus becomes commercially available according to local regulations.
