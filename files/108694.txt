CMP-001 in Combination With Pembrolizumab in Subjects With Recurrent or Metastatic Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
CMP-001-007 is a Phase 2 study of CMP-001 intratumoral (IT) and pembrolizumab intravenous (IV) administered to participants with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) who have not been previously treated with a programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blocking antibody.

The primary objective of the study is to determine the Investigator-assessed confirmed objective response with CMP-001 in combination with pembrolizumab in subjects with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)

The secondary objectives are to:

* To evaluate the safety and tolerability of CMP-001 administered by intratumoral (IT) injection in combination with pembrolizumab in subjects with HNSCC
* To evaluate the efficacy of CMP-001 in combination with pembrolizumab in subjects with HNSCC
* To evaluate the effect of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expressions on the efficacy of CMP-001 in combination with pembrolizumab

Participants will continue to receive treatment of CMP-001 and pembrolizumab according to the treatment schedule until a reason for treatment discontinuation is reached.
