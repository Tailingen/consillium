Oral Aromatase Inhibitors Modify the Gut Microbiome
The purpose of this research is to study the bacteria in participants' gut before receiving a medicine called an aromatase inhibitor for breast cancer and after participants receive medicine for breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Fecal swab collection|BIOLOGICAL: Blood samples
Change in Gut Microbial Levels - Fecal Swab, To describe the microbiome shift of gut microbiome from baseline after 4-weeks and 12-weeks of oral aromatase inhibitor treatment Investigators will calculate the change in gut microbial levels using paired t-tests., At baseline, 4 weeks and 12 weeks
Change in Gut Microbial Levels - Blood Samples, Investigators will calculate Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficients between diversity and gut microbial levels and circulating sex hormone metabolite concentrations at baseline and at 12 weeks. Bacterial derived bioactive compounds, bile acids, and glucuronidated sex hormones will be compared by metabolomics conducted on plasma., At baseline and at 12 weeks|Change in Sex Hormone Concentrations - Blood Samples, Investigators will fit a model with independent variables of the value (baseline or 12 weeks), and a second variable that represents the change from baseline (will be 0 or the change at 12 weeks).

Estrone, estrone-3-glucuronide, and estrone-3-sulfate concentrations will be measured using an ELISA assay conducted on plasma., At baseline and at 12 weeks
Primary Objective: To describe the microbiome shift of gut microbiome from baseline after 4-weeks and 12-weeks of oral aromatase inhibitor treatment.

Secondary Objective

* To correlate gut microbiome populations with circulating sex hormone metabolite concentrations at baseline and 12 weeks.
* To describe the correlation of change in the microbiome populations with change in circulating sex hormone metabolite concentrations from baseline to 12 weeks.
