This study aims to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy in obese patients with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome（PCOS). About 100 obese patients with PCOS and 100 simple obese patients (without complications) were enrolled.

All PCOS patients with obesity underwent LSG. A multidisciplinary team evaluated participants with obesity at baseline, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months after LSG. Anthropometrics, Metabolic indicators, sex hormones, menstruation，glucose-lipid metabolic markers, and hepatic steatosis were measured baseline and postoperative.
