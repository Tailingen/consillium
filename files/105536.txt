Psychosocial Benefits of Exercise in Endometrial Cancer Survivors
To determine if weekly exercise compared to stretching has an effect on fatigue, depression, and anxiety in endometrial cancer survivors.

Endometrial cancer is the most prevalent gynecologic cancer in women. Because of its excellent 5 year survival rate of 83%, addressing longer term cancer effects in this group is an important aspect of cancer survivor care. Unfortunately, women with a history of endometrial cancer may report persistent levels of fatigue, depression, and anxiety that are, on average, higher than those of healthy, gynecologic out-patients. Physical activity is one potential approach to reducing these symptoms, but little is known about the effects of physical activity in endometrial cancer survivors specifically. Furthermore, current evidence is insufficient to make recommendations regarding the optimal exercise amount, type, and duration for improving fatigue, depression, or anxiety after a cancer diagnosis (any cancer type).

This pilot, randomized trial is unique in its focus on endometrial cancer survivors, a previously understudied population with a large potential for benefiting from regular physical activity. Two separate walking intervention groups will work with an exercise specialist three times a week to walk for either 75 minutes (group 1) or 150 minutes (group 2) weekly. The participants will start out slowly and then gradually increase to the particular group goal of 75 or 150 minutes. The stretching exercise group will work with an exercise specialist doing stretching/flexibility exercises three times a week starting with 15 seconds and then gradually increasing to 30 seconds of holding the stretch.
