Study of Combination of PIGEV Before Autologous Stem Cell Transplant in Patients With Hodgkin's Lymphoma
study to assess maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety, tolerability and activity of IGEV (Ifosfamide, Gemcitabine,Vinorelbine, Prednisolone) + Panobinostat new combination in order to determine the recommended phase II dose
Hodgkin's Lymphoma
DRUG: panobinostat|DRUG: Ifosfamide|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Vinorelbine|DRUG: Prednisolone
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) or the recommended phase II dose defined as the highest dosage cohort at which no more than one of six patients will experience a DLT in the first treatment cycle., 3 weeks
DLT, Incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), 3 weeks|safety profile, Preliminary safety profile defined as Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events ( SAEs) \& Changes in Clinical Laboratory Evaluations, 3 months|Complete Response and Overall Response Rate, 3 months|hematologic toxicity, Assessment of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia incidence, duration, as well as platelet transfusion requirement, 3 months|CD34+ cells count, Assessment of number of CD34+ collected and number of leukapheresis required to obtain an appropriate collection according to transplant program., 3 months|efficacy of PIGEV combination in terms of progression-free survival, 3 years
Patients will received 4 p-IGEV courses repeated every 3 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity, whenever an objective response is observed at disease evaluation performed after II cycle.

Eligible patients will be accrued in cohorts of 3 patients at each dose level and dose escalation will be performed following the standard 3+3 rule.

Three patients will be treated for each dose-level, starting from level 1, for one cycle: if no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) will be recorded after the first cycle, treatment will be continued in those patients until study completion or unacceptable toxicity and three new patients will be treated at the next dose level. However, if one out of 3 patients will develop a DLT, the same dose-level will be administered to three additional patients for one cycle. If no one of those additional patients will experience a DLT, dose escalation will continue. If more than one over 3 or 6 patients will develop a DLT after the first cycle in any cohort, MTD will be reached. Six further patients will be treated at the lower dose in order to obtain more information about the optimal dose for phase II trials and to characterize pharmacokinetic profiles of this combination. If DLT will be found at level 1 (20 mg), 3 patients will be treated at dose -1 (10 mg). If no more than 1 patient experience toxicity, other 3 patients will be treated to assess more information about pharmacokinetic profiles and safety.
