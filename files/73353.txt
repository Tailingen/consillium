Intrathecal Injection Pemetrexed And Bevacizumab in Patients With Leptomeningeal Metastases in NSCLC
This is a prospective, single-arm, phase Ia clinical study, which was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Pemetrexed Combined With Bevacizumab Intrathecal Injection in Patients With Leptomeningeal Metastases in NSCLC.
Lung Cancer (NSCLC)|Leptomeningeal Metastasis
DRUG: Pemetrexed|DRUG: Bevacizumab
Incidence of Adverse Events (Safety and Tolerability), Number of participants with adverse events, treatment emergent adverse events,and serious adverse events assessed by CTCAE v5.0 as a measure of safety and tolerability., From the beginning of the treatment until two months after the treatment.
Overall Survival (OS), Kaplan-Meier method used to estimate the distribution of OS from the start of study treatment., Up to 2 years
Clinical response rate, The evaluation of clinical response rate was assessed by the investigators, which based on improvement of neurologic symptoms/signs and changes in the Karnofsky performance status score . This evaluation consists of five layers, including complete response (CR), obvious response (OR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD).Clinical response was defined as the continuous presence of CR, OR or PR within an interval of at least 1 week. SD and PD were defined as ineffective., Up to 2 years|CSF cytology, Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was collected before each cycle of intrathecal treatment, and assessed by the investigators the presence of tumor cells (Positive or Nagetive)., From the beginning of the intrathecal treatment until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 2 years|Radiographic assessment, Radiographic assessment with complete contrast-enhanced neuro-axis MRI or CT, Leptomeningeal metastases response was evaluated using the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria., From the beginning of the treatment until two months after the treatment.
