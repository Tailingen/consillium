A Study of Second-line Treatment With Apatinib in Patients With Advanced Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma
The purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy and safety of second-line treatment of apatinib in advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma patients and evaluate drug safety, progression free and overall survival. The primary endpoint of this study is objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR) and progression-free survival (PFS).

DRUG: Apatinib
Progression-free Survival (PFS), A duration from the date of initial treatment with apatinib to disease progression (as defined by RECIST) or death., six months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), one year|Disease Control Rate (DCR), one year
Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) was calculated from the date of initial treatment with apatinib to the date of death due to any cause, two years|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Event, one year
