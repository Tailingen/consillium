Comparison of the Effects of Fentanyl, Oxycodone, Butorphanol on Gastrointestinal Function
Postoperative ileus (POI) is a transient loss of coordinated peristalsis precipitated by surgery and exacerbated by opioid pain medication.So,how to provide patients with ideal analgesia without affecting the recovery of postoperative gastrointestinal function?This was a prospective randomized controlled study. A total of 105 patients who were scheduled for laparoscopic hysterectomy were randomly selected from The First Affiliated Hospital with Nanjing Medical University by random number table. These patients were randomly divided into three groups: fentanyl(F) group, oxycodone(O) group and butorphanol(B) group.

Background: Patients often experience pain after gynecological laparoscopy. However, the use of opioid analgesia after surgery may increase the incidence of postoperative ileus (POI). Postoperative ileus (POI) is a common surgical emergency after a surgical procedure, leading to infection and intestinal adhesions, which can extend hospitalization and increase readmission rates, and consequently increasing healthcare costs. How to provide patients with ideal analgesia without affecting the recovery of postoperative gastrointestinal function? There is no guideline which has been troubling clinical anesthesiologists.

Aims: To observe the effects of fentanyl, oxycodone, Butorphanol on the recovery of gastrointestinal function after laparoscopic hysterectomy.

Methods: A total of 105 patients undergoing laparoscopic hysterectomy were randomly divided to three groups: fentanyl group(group F), butorphanol group(group B), or oxycodone group(group O). The primary outcome measures were postoperative time to first anal exhaust the total analgesic doses in PCIA,effective bolus times. Patients were also assessed for pain with a visual analogue scale (VAS), the cumulative PCIA dose, adverse effects (Nausea,vomiting, bradycardia, respiratory depression and pruritus), sedation level at 4, 12, 24, and 48 hours postoperatively, and satisfaction during the postoperative 48 hours and postoperative hospitalization days.
