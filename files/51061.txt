Aesthetic and Functional Outcomes of Eyelid Reconstruction After Excision of Periocular Tumors
* To determine the aesthetic and functional outcomes of different techniques used in eyelid reconstruction following periocular defects.
* To determine the complications of eyelid reconstruction and how to prevent them
Eyelid Defects|Periocular Tumors
OTHER: Eyelid reconstruction
Stability of graft or flap, Assessment of flap or graft as regard the function , stability and colour match, 9 months|Measurement of vertical and horizontal diameters of the palbepral fissure, Measurement of the length between the inner and outer canthus by ruler to determine the horizontal diameter of the palbepral fissure , and measurement of the distance between upper and lower lid margins at the pupil center to determine the vertical palbepral fissure diameter, 9 months
Donor site, Follow up of donor site, 9 months|complications, Follow up of complications, 9 months
Patients will undergo the following :

Direct eyelid closure will be done in small defects with or without canthyolysis Larger defects will be reconstructed with anterior and posterior lamella reconstruction using grafts and flaps

Patients will be followed up as regard

* The stability of flap or graft
* The vertical and horizontal measurements of palbepral fissure
* Detection of any complications
* Donor site follow up
* Patient degree of satisfaction
