Contribution of New Pancreatic MRI Sequences for the Evaluation of Tumor Response in Pancreatic Adenocarcinomas
Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is the most pessimistic digestive cancer in terms of prognosis. Tumor response assessment is crucial, and the recent development of new magnetic resonance imaging sequences, such as high resolution applied to diffusion sequences (Harder et al., 2022) or magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) (Steinkohl et al., 2021), could help address this issue.
