Function Preserving Gastrectomy for T1/2 Gastric Cancer Patients
The real world based multi-cohorts study aims to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of function preserving gastrectomy including pylorus-preserving distal gastrectomy, proximal gastrectomy and wedge gastrectomy for T1 and T2 gastric cancer patients.

Gastric cancer patients with clinical stage T1/2 will be screened for the study. For the patients enrolled, a multidisciplinary discussion will be performed to evaluate the proper gastrectomy for the patients and functional preserving gastrectomy will be considered for the indicated patients. For patients not proper for functional preserving gastrectomy, standard gastrectomies will be suggested. After surgery, a close follow up will be performed. During the study, a thorough data collection will be performed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of functional preserving gastrectomy and recovery and postoperative function of remnant stomach.
