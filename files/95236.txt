This open-label, 2-arm, nonrandomized, multicenter, Phase Ib study will investigate the safety and efficacy of obinutuzumab (RO5072759; GA101) administered in combination with chemotherapy (bendamustine or fludarabine + cyclophosphamide \[FC\] regimens) in participants with previously untreated cluster of differentiation 20 (CD20)-positive B-CLL. Participants will be enrolled to receive a maximum of 6 cycles of obinutuzumab (1000 milligrams \[mg\] intravenous \[IV\] infusion, on Days 1, 8 and 15 of Cycle 1 and Day 1 of Cycles 2 - 6) plus bendamustine (90 milligrams per meter square \[mg/m\^2\] IV, on Days 2 and 3 of Cycle 1 and Days 1 and 2 of Cycles 2 - 6) on 28 day cycles or a maximum of 6 cycles of obinutuzumab (1000 mg IV infusion, on Days 1, 8 and 15 of Cycle 1 and Day 1 of Cycles 2 - 6) plus FC (fludarabine 25 mg/m\^2 IV on Days 2, 3 and 4 of Cycle 1 and Days 1, 2 and 3 of Cycles 2 - 6; cyclophosphamide 250 mg/m\^2 IV on Days 2, 3 and 4 of Cycle 1 and Days 1, 2 and 3 of Cycles 2 - 6) on 28 day cycles.

Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve (AUC) of Obinutuzumab, AUC is a measure of the serum concentration of the drug over time. It is used to characterize drug absorption., Pre-dose on Cycle (C) 1 Day (D) 1, immediately after end of infusion (0.5 hour), 0.5 hour of split dose of C1D2, pre-dose and immediately after end of infusion on C1D3, 8, 15, C2D1, C4D1, C6D1 and at progression (up to 1.75 year overall)|Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of Obinutuzumab, Pre-dose on Cycle (C) 1 Day (D) 1, immediately after end of infusion (0.5 hour), 0.5 hour of split dose of C1D2, pre-dose and immediately after end of infusion on C1D3, 8, 15, C2D1, C4D1, C6D1 and at progression (up to 1.75 year overall)|Trough Plasma Concentration (Ctrough) of Obinutuzumab, Pre-dose on C1D1, C1D3, 8, 15, C2D1, C4D1, C6D1|Clearance of Obinutuzumab, Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Clearance was estimated from population PK modeling. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood., Pre-dose on C1D1, immediately after end of infusion (0.5 hour), 0.5 hour of split dose of C1D2, pre-dose and immediately after end of infusion on C1D3, 8, 15, C2D1, C4D1, C6D1 and at progression (up to 1.75 year overall)|Volume of Distribution of Obinutuzumab, Volume of distribution is defined as the theoretical volume in which the total amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the desired plasma concentration of a drug. Apparent volume of distribution after oral dose (Vz/F) is influenced by the fraction absorbed., Pre-dose on Cycle (C) 1 Day (D) 1, immediately after end of infusion (0.5 hour), 0.5 hour of split dose of C1D2, pre-dose and immediately after end of infusion on C1D3, 8, 15, C2D1, C4D1, C6D1 and at progression (up to 1.75 year overall)|Half-Life of Obinutuzumab, Plasma decay half-life is the time measured for the plasma concentration to decrease by one half., Pre-dose on Cycle (C) 1 Day (D) 1, immediately after end of infusion (0.5 hour), 0.5 hour of split dose of C1D2, pre-dose and immediately after end of infusion on C1D3, 8, 15, C2D1, C4D1, C6D1 and at progression (up to 1.75 year overall)|Percentage of Participants With Objective Response, Assessed According to International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) Guidelines, Objective response was defined as a complete response (CR), CR with incomplete marrow recovery (CRi) or partial response (PR), as determined by investigator. CR:required peripheral blood lymphocytes \<4x10\^9/L; absence of lymphadenopathy; no hepatomegaly or splenomegaly by physical examination as determined by measurement below relevant costal margin; absence of disease/constitutional symptoms; bone marrow at least normocellular for age, with \<30% of nucleated cells being lymphocytes.

CRi:met all CR criteria including confirmed lymphocyte infiltration \<30%; may not meet Hb, platelet or neutrophil count recovery. The 95% confidence interval (CI) was estimated by Clopper-Pearson method.
