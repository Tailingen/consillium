A Clinical Study of LUNG-CT CAD Decision Support
This product is a computer-aided detection software designed to assist clinicians in detecting lung nodules in chest computer tomography. This product receives from PACS, radiology information system or directly from computer tomography scanner. After receiving the image, the product performs image analysis and provides a mark of suspected lung nodules. Users can use existing medical image capture and transmission systems or reading software to view these annotations on the workstation.

The main purpose of this trial is to verify that when clinicians perform chest CT pulmonary nodule detection, compared to only diagnosis based on chest CT images, whether the "Taihao" lung CT decision support system helps to improve the diagnostic efficiency of clinicians.

The secondary purpose is to evaluate that when clinicians perform chest CT pulmonary nodule detection, compared to only diagnosis based on chest CT images, whether the "Taihao" lung CT decision support system helps to improve the sensitivity, specificity, and image interpretation time (Reading Time) of clinicians.
