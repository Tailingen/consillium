Prevalence Study of Iron Deficiency in Patients With Cancer
Despite its high prevalence, a recent study conducted by Prof. Cacoub (unpublished) on the french national health insurance database showed that iron deficiency was an underdiagnosed and under-treated co-morbidity. In inflammatory situations, especially during cancer, the measurement of the transferrin saturation factor is only performed in about 10% of cases whereas this measure is recommended in inflammatory situations including cancer (French Health High Authority 2011)
