Phase 1/2a DTA-H19 in Patients With Unresectable Pancreatic Cancer
This study is designed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and preliminary efficacy of DTA-H19 administered intratumorally in patients with unresectable, locally advanced pancreatic cancer.

Primary Objective: The primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of intratumoral DTA-H19 and identify any dose limiting toxicities (DLTs).

Secondary objectives include determining the adverse events (AEs) profile, effects on clinical laboratory analytes, vital signs, PK, tumor response, and possible tumor resectability after 4 intratumoral administrations of DTA-H19.
Pancreatic Neoplasms
BIOLOGICAL: DTA-H19
Maximal Tolerated Dose (MTD) & Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) of Intratumoral Injections of BC-819, If 2 patients in any cohort experience DLTs, then the next lower dose will be considered the MTD if there is a lower dose cohort. A DLT is defined as grade 3 or greater toxicity judged to be at least possibly related to the investigational products., Week 4
Tumor Response, Tumor response and progression were defined in accordance with RECIST v. 1.0 and assessed by radiological examination 2 weeks after the end of treatment, 4 weeks|Tumor Resectability, The number of subjects in each cohort whose tumor was resectable at the end of the study was to be presented for the ITT and the per-protocol population., 5 to 6 weeks
DTA-H19, is a doubled stranded DNA plasmid that carries the gene for the diphtheria toxn A (DT-A) chain under the regulation of the H19 promoter sequence. This is a Patient-Oriented, Targeted Therapy as DT-A chain expression is triggered by the presence of H19 transcription factors that are upregulated in tumor cells. The selective initiation of toxin expression results in selective tumor cell destruction via inhibition of protein synthesis in the tumor cell, enabling highly targeted cancer treatment.
