New Classification of Stomach Using Probe-based Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy
The aim of the present study was to propose a new pCLE classification of gastric pit patterns and vessel architecture, and to assess the accuracy and interobserver agreement of this new pCLE classification system in the stomach.
Gastric Cancer|Intestinal Metaplasia|Atrophic Gastritis|Inflammation
DEVICE: probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy
The diagnostic accuracy of the new classification system, Patients will be prospectively recruited to evaluate the diagnostic sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the new classification of gastric pit patterns and vessel architecture using probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy, 3 month
Probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE; Cellvizio, Mauna Kea Technologies, Paris, France) is a newly developed endoscopic device which allows the application of laser microscopy with any conventional endoscope and mosaic imaging. Previous studies have demonstrated its application in various GI diseases, including Barrett's esophagus, colonic adenoma, ulcerative colitis, and etc. However, limited data are provided on exploring the application of pCLE in the stomach. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to propose a new pCLE classification of gastric pit patterns and vessel architecture, and to assess the accuracy and interobserver agreement of this new pCLE classification system in the stomach.
