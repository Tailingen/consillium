A Trial to Assess Efficacy and Safety of Octreotide Subcutaneous Depot in Patients with GEP-NET
The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness and safety of CAM2029 to octreotide LAR or lanreotide ATG in patients with advanced, well-differentiated GEP-NET. Patients who experience progressive disease in the randomized part of the study may proceed to an open-label extension part with intensified treatment with CAM2029.
Gastro-enteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumor
DRUG: CAM2029|DRUG: Octreotide LAR|DRUG: Lanreotide ATG
Progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by a Blinded Independent Review Committee (BIRC), PFS is defined as time from the date of randomization to the date of the first documented disease progression as per RECIST 1.1 or death due to any cause (whichever occurs first), From date of randomization until disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever comes first, assessed up to 48 months
Overall survival, The time from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause, Up to 2 years following the primary efficacy analysis|PFS as assessed by local Investigators, PFS is defined as time from the date of randomization to the date of the first documented disease progression as per RECIST 1.1 or death due to any cause (whichever occurs first), From date of randomization until disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever comes first, assessed up to 48 months|Overall response rate, The proportion of patients with best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), as per BIRC according to RECIST 1.1, From date of randomization until disease progression, assessed up to 48 months|Disease control rate, The proportion of patients with a best overall response of CR, PR or stable disease (SD), as per BIRC according to RECIST 1.1, From date of randomization until disease progression, assessed up to 48 months|Time to tumor response, The time from the date of randomization to the first documented response of CR or PR, as per BIRC according to RECIST 1.1, From date of randomization until disease progression, assessed up to 48 months|Duration of response, The time from the date of the first documented response of CR or PR to the date of the first documented progression or death due to underlying cancer, as per BIRC according to RECIST 1.1, From date of randomization until disease progression or death due to underlying cancer, whichever comes first, assessed up to 48 months|Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events, From screening to the safety follow-up, assessed up to 6 years
