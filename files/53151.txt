Diffusion-tensor Imaging in Brain Tumors Evaluation
Primary and secondary brain tumors are challenging pathologies regarding diagnosis and treatment. MRI is widely used in the imaging evaluation and surgical planning, due to its spatial resolution and ability of tissular characterization.

In this study patients with suspected brain tumors, confirmed by routine MRI evaluation (T1, T2, T2\*, FLAIR, T1 with contrast sequences) will undergo DWI and DTI evaluation. By analyzing collected data from MRI evaluation and patient records regarding surgical and histopathological data our aim is to investigate derived imaging biomarkers with impact in the surgical planning and rehabilitation of the patients.
