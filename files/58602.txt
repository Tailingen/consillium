A Study of AC176 for the Treatment of Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer
This clinical trial is evaluating a drug called AC176 in participants with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have progressed on at least two prior systemic therapies.

The main goals of this study are to:

* Identify the recommended dose of AC176 that can be given safely to participants
* Evaluate the side effects of AC176
* Evaluate pharmacokinetics of AC176
* Evaluate the effectiveness of AC176
