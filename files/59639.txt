Chronic Pain in Post-Mastectomy Patients; The Difference Between Pectoral Nerve (PECS I-II) and Erector Spinal Plane (ESP) Blocks
This study looks at two types of injections (called PECS and ESP blocks) to see which one works better for reducing pain after breast cancer surgery (mastectomy).

The main question it asks is: Which block is better at reducing pain after surgery - PECS or ESP? Women who had this surgery and received one of the two blocks were followed for three months. We looked at how much pain they felt, how much pain medication they needed, and whether they still had pain months later.

The results showed that both blocks helped with pain right after surgery. The ESP block lasted a little longer at first, but in general, both groups needed about the same amount of pain medicine. Three months later, about half of the patients still had some pain - especially those who had more extensive surgery or had nerve pain early on. There was no big difference between the two blocks when it came to long-term pain.

Incidence of Chronic Postoperative Pain (NRS ≥1), The presence of chronic pain will be evaluated at 3 months postoperatively using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS). Patients reporting a score of ≥1 will be considered to have chronic postoperative pain. This measure aims to assess the long-term effectiveness of PECS I-II and ESP blocks in reducing chronic pain following mastectomy., 3 months after surgery
Postoperative Acute Pain Scores (NRS), Pain intensity will be measured using the Numeric Rating Scale (0-10). Scores will be compared between the PECS and ESP groups to evaluate differences in early postoperative pain control., At 20 minutes, 6 hours, and 24 hours after surgery|Total Postoperative Opioid Consumption (Morphine, mg), The total amount of intravenous morphine consumed via patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump will be recorded and compared between groups to assess analgesic requirements., Within 24 hours after surgery|Time to First Analgesic Requirement, The time interval from the end of surgery to the patient's first request for opioid analgesia will be recorded in minutes. This outcome reflects the duration of initial analgesia provided by the block., Within 24 hours after surgery|Postoperative Quality of Life (SF-12 Score), The SF-12 Health Survey will be used to assess the physical and mental components of quality of life. Results will be compared between groups and correlated with chronic pain presence., 3 months after surgery|Presence of Neuropathic Pain (DN4 Score > 4), In patients with NRS \> 0, the DN4 (Douleur Neuropathic 4) questionnaire will be used to assess the presence of neuropathic pain. Scores \> 4 indicate neuropathic pain., At 20 minutes, 6 hours, 24 hours, and 3 months after surgery
Despite advancements in breast cancer treatment, chronic postoperative pain-known as post-mastectomy pain syndrome (PMPS)-remains a common complication, with reported rates between 40-50%. It is typically neuropathic in nature and linked to factors such as axillary lymph node dissection, radiotherapy, and high levels of acute postoperative pain. Younger patients are at higher risk, and early neuropathic symptoms may predict long-term pain.

Regional anesthesia techniques, including PECS and erector spinae plane (ESP) blocks, are widely used to improve perioperative pain control and potentially reduce the incidence of chronic pain. These techniques are considered effective and low-risk adjuncts to general anesthesia.

This prospective observational study compares the impact of PECS I-II and ESP blocks on chronic pain development in patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy (MRM). The primary outcome is the incidence of pain at 3 months postoperatively (NRS ≥1). Secondary outcomes include acute pain scores, intraoperative fentanyl use, postoperative morphine requirements, and time to first analgesic. The study also explores associations between chronic pain and variables such as lymph node dissection, radiotherapy.

Findings aim to guide clinical practice in selecting regional anesthesia techniques that provide both immediate and long-term pain relief.
