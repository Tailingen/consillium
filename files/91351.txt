Postoperative Follow-up of Asymptomatic Papillary Microcarcinomas on Patient Survival
This is a study assessing the interest of post-operative follow-up of asymptomatic papillary microcarcinomas. Today, this post-operative follow-up represents an economic cost and is a source of anxiety for patients.

The aim of this study is to determine the global survival of patients with asymptomatic papillary microcarcinoma to assess the interest of a post-operative ultrasound and/or biological follow-up.
