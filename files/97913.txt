A Clinical Study of Injectable IMM0306 in Combination With Lenalidomide
The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IMM0306 in combination with lenalidomide in patients with relapsed/refractory CD20-positive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
DRUG: IMM0306|DRUG: Lenalidomide capsule
Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), To be summarized using descriptive statistics, Though end of DLT evaluation period,up to approximately 28 days.|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), If the planned dose escalation of IMM0306 in combination with lenalidomide to a preset highest dose group (i.e., the single-agent RP2D dose recommended in the IMM0306-I trial) does not reach MTD, it will be possible to continue to increase the dose exploration or explore new frequency of administration. SMC will also review pre-safety data and recommend whether to further increase the dose and explore new dosing frequencies., Dose-limiting toxicities will be evaluated during the first cycle (28 days) of treatment.
Main study purpose:

To assess the safety and tolerability of IMM0306 in combination with lenalidomide to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) (if available) and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D).

Secondary study purpose

1. To assess the antitumor efficacy of IMM0306 in combination with lenalidomide.
2. To assess the immunogenicity of IMM0306 in combination with lenalidomide.
3. To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of IMM0306 in combination with lenalidomide.

Exploratory study purpose:

1. Explore the correlation between exposure to IMM0306 and efficacy and safety (data permitting).
2. Explore the correlation of biomarkers with safety.
