A Phase I Study of Oral Asciminib (ABL001) in Patients With CML or Ph+ ALL
The design of a phase I, open label, dose finding study was chosen in order to establish a safe and tolerated dose of single agent ABL001 in Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia chromosome positive Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) patients who are relapsed or refractory to or are intolerant of Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), and of ABL001+Nilotinib, ABL001+Imatinib and ABL001+Dasatinib in Ph positive CML patients who are relapsed or refractory to TKIs.

This first-in-human trial with ABL001 was a dose escalation study whose primary purpose was to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended dose for expansion (RDE) of single agent ABL001 in CML or Ph+ ALL patients, and in combination with either Nilotinib or Imatinib or Dasatinib in Ph positive CML patients. The safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of ABL001 and ABL001+Nilotinib, ABL001+Imatinib and ABL001+Dasatinib were assessed together with an evaluation of pharmacodynamic (PD) changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and bone marrow aspirates and all data could contribute to the assessment of the RDE.

An understanding of the MTD/RDE, safety profile, PK/PD relationship, and preliminary evidence of anti-CML and ALL activity wias used to inform future development in adults with CML and Ph+ ALL. By virtue of its distinct pharmacological profile and by preclinical pharmacological studies demonstrating an additive effect, a combination of ABL001 and a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) has the potential to achieve a deeper molecular response in a higher proportion of CML patients as compared to single agent TKI therapy. Such a combination has the added advantage of targeting the ABL kinase domain at two distinct locations, theoretically preventing single point mutation-associated treatment resistance. The prediction is that a nilotinib+ABL001, imatinib+ABL001 and/or dasatinib+ABL001 combination will increase the percentage of patients who achieve a complete molecular response (CMR) and decrease the time to CMR, thereby increasing the possibility of achieving sustained treatment-free remissions in these patients. In addition, some patients could be intolerant of therapy with TKIs or could develop mutations that promote resistance to TKI therapy. In these patients, ABL001 could provide a novel therapeutic option.
