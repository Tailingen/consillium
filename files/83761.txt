Efficacy and Safety of Fluzoparib Combined With Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy for HR+/HER2- SNF3-subtype Early Breast Cancer (BCTOP-L-A01)
This is a prospective, randomized, open-label phase III clinical study on the efficacy and safety of fluzoparib combined with adjuvant endocrine therapy versus adjuvant endocrine therapy for HR+/HER2- SNF3-subtype early breast cancer.

invasive disease free survival (iDFS), defined as occurrence of any of the following: ipsilateral invasive breast cancer recurrence, regional invasive breast cancer recurrence, distant recurrence, death attributable to any cause, contralateral invasive breast cancer, or second non-breast invasive cancer.In-situ events are not included., 5 years
distant relapse free survival (DRFS), the time from operation to the first distant recurrence, and the cases of death without distant recurrence was censored at the time of the death, 5 years|overall survival (OS), the time from treatment to death, regardless of disease recurrence, 5 years|Adverse Effects, an undesired harmful effect resulting from a medication or other intervention, 5 years|Number of participants with Patient Reported Outcome (PRO), a health outcome directly reported by the patient who experienced it., 5 years
This is a prospective, randomized, open-label phase III clinical study on the efficacy and safety of fluzoparib combined with adjuvant endocrine therapy versus adjuvant endocrine therapy for HR+/HER2- SNF3-subtype early breast cancer.

A total of 766 patients with luminal-type early breast cancer who received surgery at the Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Cancer and were classified as SNF3 (proliferative) by SNF algorithm fusion clustering will be collected for this study. Before enrollment, the primary tumors of the patients were subjected to molecular typing based on H\&E slices combined with digital pathology, and subsequent enrollment could be considered if patient pathology was confirmed as SNF3 subtype.
