Study of FOLFIRI Plus Cetuximab Plus IMO-2055 in Patients With Colorectal Cancer
Open-label phase 1b trial. Study treatment will be administered in 3 week cycles.

There are two distinct parts in this study:

* Part 1: Dose escalation from IMO-2055
* Part 2: Once a recommended phase 2 dose is found additional tolerability and pharmacodynamics will be explored
Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: IMO-2055|DRUG: Cetuximab|DRUG: FOLFIRI
• The primary objective of this study is to determine the recommended phase 2 dose of IMO 2055 when combined with FOLFIRI and cetuximab in patients with histologically proven advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC)., 10 months from first patient in, Oct 2010
• To evaluate the safety of weekly IMO 2055 combined with FOLFIRI plus cetuximab., Assessed weekly at patient visits|• To investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of IMO-2055., Assessed weekly at patient visits until Cycle 4|• To investigate the tolerability and pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of dexamethasone scheduling with IMO 2055 and FOLFIRI., Assessed weekly at patient visits until Cycle 4|• To investigate potential signs of efficacy using the Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors (RECIST) response rate in patients with measurable disease., Every six weeks|• To investigate progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival for up to one year in all patients., Every three months|• To investigate results of subsequent therapy (if any) in all patients., Every three months|• To investigate potential markers of IMO 2055 immune activation and effect on cellular immunity., Assessed weekly at patient visits until Cycle 4
* Part 1: Dose escalation of IMO-2055, including 3 dose groups. Once a recommended phase 2 dosage (RP2D) of IMO-2055 given concomitantly with FOLFIRI and cetuximab is found the selected cohort will be expanded by an additional 6 to 9 patients (to a total of 12 patients) for confirmation of the RP2D and combination treatment regimen.
* Part 2: A final cohort of 12 patients (Cohort 6) will be enrolled simultaneously to explore tolerability and pharmacodynamics in patients treated with the RP2D of IMO-2055 in combination with FOLFIRI with cetuximab.
