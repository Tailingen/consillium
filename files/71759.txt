Time From PCI to Cancer Surgery and Cardiovascular and Oncologic Outcomes
To evaluate the association between time from PCI to cancer surgery and cardiovascular and oncologic outcomes in early-stage cancer patients, A retrospective, population-based cohort study was conducted using data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service (K-NHIS) database.
Coronary Artery Disease|Cancer
Occurence of Bleeding, Bleeding requiring transfusion was defined by the transfusion codes (X2021, X2022, X2031, X2032, X2091, X2092, X2111, X2112, X2131, X2132)., up to 5 years
Occurence of Spontaneous myocardial infarction, Spontaneous myocardial infarction (MI) was defined as hospitalization for MI (ICD-10 codes I21 and I22), up to 5 years|Occurence of Repeat revascularization, Repeat revascularization was defined as the presence of a procedure code after cancer surgery., up to 5 years|Occurence of Cancer recurrence, Cancer recurrence was defined as the presence of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy that began more than 6 months after surgery completion., up to 5 years|Occurence of All cause death, Vital status was obtained from death certification collected by Statistics Korea at the Ministry of Strategy and Finance of South Korea., up to 5 years
Early-stage-cancer patients with a history of PCI who underwent cancer surgery (N = 3621) were included. The patients were divided into two groups based on the time between the dates of PCI and cancer surgery (\&lt;12 months and ≥12 months). Patients were stratified into early-surgery and late-surgery, defined as patients who underwent surgery ≥1 and \&lt;1 month after cancer diagnosis. Outcomes included bleeding, spontaneous myocardial infarction (MI), repeat revascularization, cancer recurrence, and death.
