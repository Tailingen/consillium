P-BCMA-101 Tscm CAR-T Cells in the Treatment of Patients With Multiple Myeloma (MM)
Phase 1 of the study is comprised of an open-label, single ascending dose (SAD), multiple cohort study; a multiple dose cycle administration cohort study; and a combination administration study of P-BCMA-101 autologous T stem cell memory (Tscm) CAR-T cells in patients with relapsed / refractory MM. Followed by a Phase 2, open-label, efficacy and safety study. Rimiducid may be administered as indicated.

Phase 1 follows a 3 + 3 design of dose-escalating cohorts. Phase 2 of the study is an open-label multi-center efficacy and safety study. After a patient enrolls, leukapheresis will be performed to obtain peripheral blood mononuclear cells which will be sent to a manufacturing site to produce P-BCMA-101 CAR-T cells. The cells will then be returned to the investigational site and, after a standard chemotherapy based conditioning regimen, will be administered to the patient across 1-3 infusions, with or without combination therapy. Treated patients will undergo serial measurements of safety, tolerability and response. Rimiducid may be administered as indicated.
