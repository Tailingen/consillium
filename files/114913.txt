Pharmacokinetic Study of Tesmilifene (YMB1002) Plus Epirubicin and Cyclophosphamide in Metastatic Breast Cancer
This is a Phase I, multi-centre, open-label, cross-over pharmacokinetic study designed to investigate whether the co-administration of a fixed dose of tesmilifene alters the plasma pharmacokinetics of a standard regimen of epirubicin and/or its principle metabolite, epirubicinol and cyclophosphamide.
Metastatic/Recurrent Breast Cancer
DRUG: Tesmilifene (YMB 1002)
The distribution of the pharmacokinetic variables will be summarized by treatment. The variables AUC and CMAX expressed as geometric means and ratios of geometric means on the original scale of measurement.
Adverse experiences will be collected and graded using the NCI Expanded Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0.|Blood pressure, temperature, pulse and respiration will be tabulated across time and shift tables will be presented.|The tesmilifene concentration, haematology and biochemistry values will be tabulated across time.|Although response is not the endpoint of this trial, patients with measurable disease will be assessed by standard institutional criteria.
This is a Phase I, multi-centre, open-label, cross-over pharmacokinetic study designed to investigate whether the co-administration of a fixed dose of tesmilifene alters the plasma pharmacokinetics of a standard regimen of epirubicin and/or it's principle metabolite, epirubicinol and cyclophosphamide. The plasma pharmacokinetics of epirubicin/epirubicinol and cyclophosphamide when given alone or concurrently with tesmilifene will be examined. Safety information for the tesmilifene/ epirubicin and cyclophosphamide combination and for epirubicin and cyclophosphamide alone in this patient population will also be collected.
