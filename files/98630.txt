A Study of SHR-1210 in Combination With BP102 in Subjects With Non-squamous NSCLC
SHR-1210 is a humanized anti-PD1 IgG4 monoclonal antibody. This is a Phase II, multicenter, open-label study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SHR-1210 with BP102 in subjects who are chemotherapy naive and have Stage IIIB\~IV non-squamous NSCLC. The primary end points are ORR and PFS.

In this study, subjects will receive SHR-1210 combined with BP102 until progression or unacceptable toxicity (SHR-1210 or BP102 for a maximum of 2 years).
Lung Neoplasms
DRUG: SHR-1210|DRUG: BP102
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR, determined using RECIST v1.1, defined as best overall response (CR or PR) across all assessment time points during the period from enrolment to termination of trial treatment., up to approximately 1 year|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS, defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression as determined by the investigator with use of RECIST v1.1 or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Patients who have not experienced disease progression or death at the time of analysis will be censored at the time of last tumor assessment., up to approximately 1 year
Time to Response (TTR), Determined using RECIST v1.1 criteria, up to approximately 1 year|Duration of Response Rate (DoR), Determined using RECIST v1.1 criteria, up to approximately 1 year|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Determined using RECIST v1.1 criteria, up to approximately 1 year|Overall Survival Rate at 12-month (OSR), up to 1 year|Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events (AEs), Incidence, nature, and severity of adverse events graded according to the NCI CTCAE v4.03., up to approximately 1 year
