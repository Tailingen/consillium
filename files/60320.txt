Peripheral Blood Neoantigen Specific T Cells Predict the Efficacy of Immunotherapy for Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
This is a single-center clinical and exploratory study. Peripheral blood tumor antigen-specific T lymphocytes of patients with resectable esophageal cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy and patients with advanced or metastatic esophageal cancer treated with first-line chemotherapy were detected at different time points to predict ORR after neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy for resectable esophageal cancer and pCR rate, DFS after radical resection and first-line metastasis of advanced esophageal cancer Therapy combined with immunotherapy for ORR, PFS and OS.
