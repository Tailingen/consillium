DRUG: 3,4-DIAMINOPYRIDINE
This is an open-label, non-randomized, non-comparative expanded access study. Up to 25 patients with clinically proven paraneoplastic or primary autoimmune LEMS per EMG and positive voltage-gated calcium channel antibody serology, OR patients with clinically proven CMS per electromyogram (EMG), biopsy or genetic testing who meet the selection criteria outlined in sections 3.1 and 3.2 will be enrolled in this study. Subjects will receive 3,4-diaminopyridine (3,4-DAP) starting with a low dose and titrating up per efficacy and patient tolerance to a maximum daily dose of 100mg . Treatment will continue until the subject experiences a treatment-limiting toxicity, voluntarily withdraws consent, transfers to another site, dies, becomes lost to follow-up, is no longer receiving clinical benefit from 3,4-DAP (in the opinion of the subject and/or the investigator), or the Jacobus Pharmaceuticals or the FDA discontinues the study.
