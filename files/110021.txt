Exploring the Mechanism of Primary Resistance to Third-generation EGFR-TKIs as First-line Treatment in EGFR-positive Advanced NSCLC (PRECISE Study)
Lung cancer is currently the world's largest malignant tumor for cancer-related deaths with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounting for 80%-85%. Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), especially the 3rd-generation EGFR-TKIs have demonstrated strong antitumor effects in EGFR-positive patients.

However, approximately 20% of EGFR-positive were primarily resistant to 3rd generation EGFR-TKIs, i.e., clinical non-response or disease progression in the short term.

This study aimed to clarify the molecular indicators that predict the benefits of 3-rd EGFR-TKIs as first-line therapy in NSCLCpatients with EGFR-positive. Further, to clarify their primary drug resistance mechanisms, which is of great significance for the treatment and clinical decision-making of NSCLC disease.

OTHER: Genomic profiles detection|OTHER: circulating tumor DNA detection
Objective Response Rate (ORR), The proportion of patients with a complete response or partial response to treatment according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1), 2 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), Time from the beginning of treatment to the first disease progression (PD) in patients with advanced NSCLC, 3 years|Differences in genomic profiles of tumor tissues and ctDNA clearance of third-generation EGFR-TKIs sensitive and primary drug-resistant NSCLC., The patients who don't achieve partial response or progress within 6 months are defined as the primary resistant group. The genomic profiles and ctDNA clearance detected by Next-generation gene sequencing will be compared between the primary drug-resistant group and sensitive-drug group., 3 years
Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the duration from the beginning of first-line immunotherapy until death due to any cause. Subjects who are still alive at the end of the study observation period will be censored at the time of last known vital status, 5 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR), The proportion of patients with a complete response or partial response or stable desease to treatment according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1), 3 years
The correlation between tumor microenvironment signature and efficacy of 3rd EGFR-TKIs, The baseline paraffin-embedded tissue is collected and assessed by multiplex immunohistochemistry, including T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, NK lymphocytes, macrophagocyte, and DC cells. And explore the association between tumor microenvironment signature and primary resistance and the efficacy of 3rd EGFR-TKIs during the enrolled observation process., 3 years
