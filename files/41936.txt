Multi-omics Characterization of Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors and Carcinomas
In this work, the investigators count through the integrated multi-omics analysis to identify different tumor subgroups in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and carcinomas regardless of their grade and stage. To achieve this, they will resort to the use of next-generation sequencing approaches (RNAseq, then use of MCP Counter for the absolute quantification of the eight populations of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment), alterations in epigenetics with study of the methylome by MeDIP, ChIPseq, telomere (ALT) study, as well as correlation with peripheral blood neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio and immunohistochemistry data such as Ki67, p53, Rb, DAXX, ATRX, PDL1, immune cell labeling. This will be done on frozen or paraffin material. This work will provide a more complete biological picture of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and carcinomas.
