A Feasibility Study of Adaptive Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy
Patients with head and neck cancer and are schedule to receive standard radiation therapy known as IMRT to treat cancer
Head and Neck Cancer
RADIATION: IMRT
Feasibility of adaptive radiation therapy in the definitive treatment (MLC-based IMRT or helical tomotherapy), Feasibility is determined by employing weekly 3D onboard imaging for plan re-evaluation and initiation of an adaptive process if the original PTV and/or normal structure goals are compromised., 7 weeks
Measure additional time required by physician and ancillary staff for the process of adaptive IMRT, Recording on a weekly basis the actual time required for repeat CT imaging, plan re-evaluation, replanning, and repeat physics QA., 7 weeks|Identify a subset of patients in whom adaptive IMRT would be recommended, 7 weeks|Measure acute and late toxicity, Until patient death|Local, regional, and distant recurrence, Until recurrence
In this study, we will plan additional measurements of the position of the patient's organs weekly during radiation treatment. We will analyze these measurements in order to evaluate whether we need to adjust our treatment procedures for the remainder of the treatments. We might adjust the dose of radiation received to specific organs in order to try to minimize the amount of radiation the healthy tissue receives.
