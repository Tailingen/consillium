Circulating Tumor Cells and Treatment De-escalation After Neoadjuvant Therapy for HER2 Positive Breast Cancer
Phase II unicentric randomized trial which will include early HER2 positive breast cancer patients, candidate to neoadjuvant therapy with trastuzumab and pertuzumab. Circulating tumor cells will be collected at neoadjuvant therapy baseline.

Patients with pathological complete response will be randomized in 1:1 ratio for adjuvant trastuzumab (arm A) versus trastuzumab + pertuzumab (arm B) in a two factorial design: group A, with HER2 positive CTCs and group B, with HER2 negative/absent CTCs.

HER2 therapy disease-free survival, To compare the disease-free survival between trastuzumab and trastuzumab + pertuzumab arms, From adjuvant therapy initiation to recurrence or death by any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 5 years|CTCs disease-free survival, To compare the disease-free survival between patients with HER2 positive CTCs at baseline versus HER2 negative/absent CTCs, From adjuvant therapy initiation to recurrence or death by any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 5 years
Prognostic factors for disease-free survival, At baseline and adjuvant therapy (18 months)|Correlation of CTCs and pathological complete response, To evaluate if there is a correlation of HER2 positivity and the number of CTCs/ml and the pathological response, At baseline|Adverse events, To compare the adverse events between trastuzumab and trastuzumab + pertuzumab, Adjuvant period (1 year)
Patients with HER2 positive breast cancer (hormone receptors positive or negative), which are candidate to neoadjuvant therapy with pertuzumab and trastuzumab will be included.

Blood samples will be collected at baseline (before neoadjuvant start) for the analysis of CTCs and its positivity for HER2 by IHC and ISH.

Patients with pathological complete response will be included in the randomization phase of the study. There will be 2 cohorts: HER2 positive CTCs at baseline and HER2 negative/absent CTCs at baseline. In each cohort, patients will be randomized in 1:1 ratio for adjuvant trastuzumab versus adjuvant trastuzumab + pertuzumab
