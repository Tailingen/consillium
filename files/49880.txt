The Role of SNP rs2910164 in Patients Treated With Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors
The objective of this study is to investigate whether the SNP rs2910164 in the pre-miR-146a gene is associated with outcome and toxicity of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.

Severity of immune-related adverse events (irAEs), according to CTCAE, 2 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), 2 years
The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2910164 within the gene for microRNA-146a (miR-146a) reduces miR-146a expression. Previous studies of the investigators demonstrated that this SNP was associated with increased acute GvHD severity in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In this prospective, observational study the investigators aim to analyze, whether SNP rs2910164 is associated with severity of immune-related adverse events of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Moreover, association of rs2910164 with outcome parameters will be studied.
