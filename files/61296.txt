A Study of SHR-1210 Plus Apatinib in Patients With Soft Tissue Sarcoma
The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of SHR-1210 plus Apatinib versus AMD plus IFO in participants with soft tissue sarcoma.
Sarcoma
DRUG: SHR-1210 plus Apatinib|DRUG: ADM plus IFO or IFO alone
Progression Free Survival (PFS), Randomization to Radiographic Progression or Death Due to Any Cause (Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions), From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 31 months, CT was conducted at baseline、weeks 7、13、19 and then every 12 weeks.
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Baseline to documented disease Remission to study discontinuation, Partial Remission is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 30% decrease in the sum of the beaseline diameter of target lesions., From date of randomization until the date of study completion, an average of 1 year, CT was conducted at baseline、weeks 7、13、19 and then every 12 weeks.
