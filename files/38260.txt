Combined Segmentectomy Versus Lobectomy for Stage IA Lung Adenocarcinoma With Ground-glass Component of Prospective, Randomized, Controlled Clinical Study
This project intends to include stage IA lung adenocarcinoma patients with CT imaging grboreal lesions; compare the results of lobectomy vs combined subsegmentectomy, and compare perioperative complications, differences in lung function and long-term outcomes between the two groups.
