Self-compression Mammography in Clinical Practice
Every year millions of mammograms are performed worldwide, representing the primary examination for the early diagnosis of breast cancer. Despite continuous advances in medicine and technology, an aspect of mammography has not changed in over fifty years: the breast is still compressed on the detector because this allows to reduce the thickness of the breast thus improving the quality of the diagnostic image and reducing the dose of radiation necessary to obtain a clear image. Many women perceive as painful this compression, including women who have been treated for breast cancer.

Pain can discourage asymptomatic women to present themselves periodically to screening mammography, while an increasing number of women in follow-up after conservative surgery have to withstand the pain caused by mammography.

Some studies mention various factors that are responsible for pain when performing mammography: breast sensitivity, anxiety level, expected pain and staff attitude. Some studies have also identified breast density, breast volume and menstrual phase as other influencing factors, although not all studies support these hypothesis. The technical characteristics of the equipment can greatly affect annoyance, sense of oppression, pain. The technological proposals to reduce the discomfort of the patients concern various items: flexible compressors, self-compression devices under the supervision of the technician who performs the positioning and the minimum initial compression, environmental factors such as equipment noise reduction, chromatic, sound and sensory effects (eg: aromatic diffusers).

The aim of our study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the self-compression compared to the standard one, in reducing annoyance, a sense of oppression and pain, and to evaluate the difference of the average glandular dose given to the woman for each projection.

Self-compression may help reaching better compression tolerating the discomfort and pain induced thus allowing to achieve a lower thickness, a lower glandular dose and a better image.

Average glandular dose administered (mSv), Average glandular dose administered during mammography is automatically computed by the machine according to an algorithm using the data on the quantity of radiation emitted and the radiation captured by the detector., This outcome is measured at the baseline mammography.|Image quality: radiographers' scale., Radiographers evaluate the image quality after exam with a radiographer specific 3-item scale (contrast, resolution, compression) on a 0 to 5 point scale. Higher values mean better quality., This outcome is measured at the baseline mammography.|Image quality: radiologists' scale., Radiologists evaluate the image quality after exam a radiologist specific 3-item scale (contrast, resolution, compression) on a 0 to 5 point scale. Higher values mean better quality., This outcome is measured at the baseline mammography.
Breast thickness at the time of exposure (cm), Breast thickness is measured automatically by the machine. This endpoint will be evaluated using single exposure as statistical unit, taking into account the autocorrelation of the 4 exposures in the same woman., This outcome is measured at the baseline mammography.|Maximum compression (daN), Compression is measured automatically by the machine. This endpoint will be evaluated using single exposure as statistical unit, taking into account the autocorrelation of the 4 exposures in the same woman., This outcome is measured at the baseline mammography.|Pain during compression, visual assessment scale, pain will be evaluated immediately after baseline mammography execution|Memory of pain in previous mammography, visual assessment scale, before the follow up mammography, i.e. approximately 1 year after baseline mammography|Anxiety, questionnaire: State Trait Anxiety Inventory for adults - form Y (D. Spielberger).

The scale has 20 items for assessing trait anxiety and 20 for state anxiety. All items are rated on a 4-point scale. Higher scores indicate greater anxiety., Anxiety will be measured just before the baseline mammography and before the follow up mammography, i.e. approximately 1 year after baseline mammography.|Discomfort, Discomfort will be measured with a one-item scale with five-point range (no, slight, moderate, considerable and severe discomfort)., Discomfort will be measured just after the baseline mammography.|Execution time of the exam:, We evaluate: - total time (from randomization to close examination). Times are automatically registered by the radiology information system.

- Second breast time (from the acquisition of the second right breast projection to the acquisition of the second left breast projection), This outcome is measured at the baseline mammography.|Participation in follow up mammography, Number of women presenting to follow up mammography (1 year +/-2 months)/number of recruited women referred to follow up mammography after 1 year, 1 year (+/- 2 months) after baseline mammography
