Phase I Trial of BI 836845 for Various Solid Cancer
This study is a phase I, open-label, dose escalation trial to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the relevant biological dose (RBD) in the absence if a MTD of a new drug BI 836845 which blocks the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) pathway believed to be involved in cancer growth. BI 836845 will be administered for the very first time into cancer patients.

The study will also look at the overall safety of the drug, and examine the drug levels in the body at specific timepoints during the trial (pharmacokinetic profile); the effect the drug may have on tumours will also be examined (pharmacodynamics).
