Community-based Approaches to Treating Hypertension and Colon Cancer Prevention
Black men constitute the demographic group with the greatest burden of premature death and disability from hypertension (HTN) in the United States. But while the disproportionately high rate of hypertension-related morbidity and mortality is well documented, the epidemic of colorectal cancer (CRC) among black men is comparatively under-appreciated. For example, CRC is a leading cause of cancer death in black men with a death rate 50% higher than in white men. Low rates of screening for CRC in this population contribute significantly to this problem. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to evaluate the effect of a lifestyle intervention delivered through telephone-based motivational interviewing (MINT) versus a patient navigation intervention on blood pressure reduction and CRC screening.
