Bemcentinib (BGB324) in Combination With Pembrolizumab in Patients With TNBC
This is an open label, single arm, multi-centre phase II study to assess the anti-tumour activity and safety of bemcentinib (BGB324) in combination with pembrolizumab in participants with previously treated, locally advanced and unresectable, or metastatic TNBC or TN-IBC. The primary objective is objective response rate.
Triple Negative Breast Cancer|Inflammatory Breast Cancer Stage IV
DRUG: Bemcentinib; pembrolizumab
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of evaluable participants who had at least one confirmed overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. CR: Disappearance of all target lesions (TLs) since baseline, any pathological lymph nodes selected as TLs must have a reduction in short axis to less than (\<) 10 millimeter (mm). PR: At least a 30 percent decrease in the sum of the diameters of TLs, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters., Until disease progression or death or withdrawal of consent whichever comes first, up to end of study (Up to 1 year)
Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the date of first documented response until date of documented progression or death in the absence of disease progression (PD); the end of response should coincide with the date of progression or death from any cause. PD per modified RECIST 1.1 defined as: at least a 20 percent increase in the sum of diameters of TLs and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study)., Until disease progression or death or withdrawal of consent whichever comes first, up to end of study (Up to 1 year)|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of participants with a confirmed CR, PR, or stable disease (SD). CR: Disappearance of all target lesions (TLs) since baseline, any pathological lymph nodes selected as TLs must have a reduction in short axis to \< 10 mm. PR: At least a 30 percent decrease in the sum of the diameters of TLs, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. SD per modified RECIST 1.1 defined as: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD., Until disease progression or death or withdrawal of consent whichever comes first, up to end of study (Up to 1 year)|Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the duration from start of treatment until the date of radiological disease progression (the date on which the confirmed progression was initially observed) or the date of death (regardless of cause of death), whichever was earlier., Until disease progression or death or withdrawal of consent whichever comes first, up to end of study (Up to 1 year)|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from the first dose of study treatment until the date of death (from any cause and irrespective of any subsequent anti-cancer treatment given)., Until disease progression or death or withdrawal of consent whichever comes first, up to end of study (Up to 1 year)
