Learning Curve for Gastric Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection
Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for early gastric cancer is a widely accepted treatment option of expanded indication worldwide.

ESD is relatively difﬁcult compared with endoscopic mucosal resection, thus, proper training is essential for the safe performance of the procedure. Thus, it is necessary to receive proper training in the procedure for safe performance of ESD. Previous studies reported that there was a learning curve in ESD training and preceptees needed to perform at least 30-40 procedures in order to master this technique. However, there is few study about the association between the clinical characteristics and competence level for gastric ESD.
Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection|Gastric Neoplasm
PROCEDURE: Endoscopic submucosal dissection
Resection speed, Deﬁned as resected lesion size divided by ESD procedure time, 4 weeks
Complication rate, ESD-related bleeding, gastric perforation, patient's death, 4 weeks
This study aims to evaluate the clinical outcomes of ESD and to describe the learning curve for ESD of the gastric neoplasm, based on the analysis of a single endoscopist's experience.
