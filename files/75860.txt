A Study of CTX-009 (ABL001) in Combination With Irinotecan or Paclitaxel in Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumor Patients
This study is a Phase 1b/2 multi-center study to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics of CTX-009 (ABL001) in combination with Irinotecan or Paclitaxel in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
P1b: Advanced Solid Tumors|P2: Biliary Tract Cancer
DRUG: CTX-009 (ABL001)|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Irinotecan
P1b: Proportion of subjects with Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT), Number of subjects who experience DLT events during 28 days after first administration of CTX-009 (ABL001) and Irinotecan/Paclitaxel, divided by the number of DLT-evaluable subjects, From Day 1 until disease progression or Day 28, whichever came first|P2: Objective response rate (ORR) of CTX-009 (ABL001) in combination with paclitaxel in patients with BTC, The proportion of subjects whose best overall response (BOR) is assessed to be complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as per Independent Radiology Center's review, Up to approximately 24 months
Adverse Events (AEs), Severity of AEs will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0, Up to approximately 24 months|Pharmacokinetics (PK) of CTX-009 (ABL001), Serum concentrations of CTX-009 (ABL001) will be collected and analyzed to evaluate the PK of CTX-009 (ABL001), Up to approximately 24 months|Objective response rate (ORR), Proportion of subject with best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as per investigator's review, Up to approximately 24 months|Disease control rate (DCR), Proportion of subjects with a best overall response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD), Up to approximately 24 months|Time to treatment failure (TTF), Time interval from 1st administration of CTX-009 (ABL001) to the time of disease progression or discontinuation of CTX-009 (ABL001) due to whatever reason, whichever comes first, Up to approximately 24 months|Duration of response (DOR), Time interval from first occurrence of a documented objective response to the time of disease progression, Up to approximately 24 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), The time from the initiation of treatment to the first radiologic assessment that confirms progression of tumor or to death, Up to approximately 24 months|P2: Survival rate, The proportion of subjects who have survived at 6 months and 12 months from the initiation of treatment, 6 months and 12 months|P2: Overall survival (OS), Time from the initiation of treatment to death, Up to approximately 24 months
Phase 1b Study:

Indication of phase 1b study is the advanced or metastatic solid tumors (including, but not limited to, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, and ovarian cancer).

Phase 2 Study:

Indication of phase 2 study is unresectable advanced, metastatic or recurrent biliary tract cancer (BTC) (including intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, gallbladder cancer, and ampullary carcinoma).
