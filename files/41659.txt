Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin is currently the only German University Hospital with an available capacitive radiofrequency electromagnetic field treatment device. While there is only data available regarding the low toxicity profile of radiofrequency electromagnetic field treatment for various regions of the body including the abdomen there is no data available on the combined effect of TAS-102 and Bevacizumab and radiofrequency electromagnetic field treatment. The investigators aim to conduct a feasibility trial and plan to compare the results with data of a prospective trial with a comparable patient population.
