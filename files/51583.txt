Trial of Three Stem Cell Mobilization Regimens for Multiple Myeloma
This phase III randomized trial compares three different peripheral stem cell mobilization regimens for patients with multiple myeloma who have received primary induction therapy or other therapies. Up to 180 patients will be enrolled. Patients eligible for treatment will be randomized to one of the three following mobilization regimens:

Arm A = VELCADE, CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE, \& G-CSF Arm B = VELCADE \& G-CSF Arm C = CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE \& G-CSF Arm D = PLERIXAFOR \& G-CSF Arm E = PLERIXAFOR, VELCADE, \& G-CSF
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: bortezomib (Velcade)|DRUG: cyclophosphamide|DRUG: G-CSF|DRUG: Plerixafor
Number of Patients Able to Collect >=6 x 106 CD34+ Cells/kg in <= 2 Collections., The primary endpoint in all five treatment arms is the percentage of patients who are able to achieve greater than 6 x 106 CD34+ stems cells/kg harvested (defined as effectiveness). Note that no patients were enrolled Arm D and Arm E., 36 months
Number of Patients Who Achieved Neutrophil Recovery After Melphalan 200 Based Transplant, Number of patients who achieved neutrophil recovery after Melphalan 200 based transplant in 20 days or fewer. Neutrophil recovery is defined as an absolute neutrophil count of greater than 0.5 k/uL for three consecutive days., 20 days post-transplant|Number of Patients Who Achieved Platelet Recovery After Melphalan 200 Based Transplant, Number of patients who achieved platelet recovery after Melphalan 200 based transplant in 20 days or fewer. Platelet recovery is defined as a platelet count of greater than 20,000, untransfused, for three consecutive days., 20 days post-transplant
PRIMARY STUDY OBJECTIVES

• To compare the efficacy of the following peripheral stem cell mobilization regimens for MM: i. High dose cyclophosphamide, VELCADE, and G-CSF ii. VELCADE and G-CSF iii. High dose cyclophosphamide and G-CSF

SECONDARY STUDY OBJECTIVES

• To evaluate biomarkers as surrogate markers of mobilization in each arm To evaluate changes in tumor mass as defined by standard response parameters. To evaluate the safety of each of the arms.
