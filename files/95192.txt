Treatment of Cerebral Radiation Necrosis (CRN) With Nerve Growth Factor (NGF)
Cerebral radiation necrosis (CRN) is a well-documented late complication of radiation therapy for cancers, and may have a devastating effect on the patient's quality of life (QOL). However,CRN was once regarded as a progressive and irreversible disease, no standard therapy has been suggested for CRN. In our clinical practice, we have used nerve growth factor(NGF) to treat CRN, and found that GM1 can successfully reverse CRN. A case report has been published in Journal of Clinical Oncology (JCO) in 2011. So we carried out this prospective study to test the efficacy of NGF for CRN.
