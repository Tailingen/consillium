Treatment of Milademetan Versus Trabectedin in Patient With Dedifferentiated Liposarcoma
Randomized, multicenter, open-label, Phase 3 registration study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of milademetan compared to trabectedin in patients with unresectable (i.e., where resection is deemed to cause unacceptable morbidity or mortality) or metastatic DD liposarcoma that progressed on 1 or more prior systemic therapies, including at least 1 anthracycline-based therapy.
Dedifferentiated Liposarcoma
DRUG: RAIN-32|DRUG: Trabectedin
Compare Progression-free Survival (PFS) as Determined by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) Between the Milademetan Treatment Arm and Trabectedin Control Arm, PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the earliest date of the first objective documentation of radiographic disease progression, or death due to any cause. Disease progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., from the randomization date to date of documented progression or death, up to 13 months
Overall Survival (OS), OS as measured from the date of randomization to date of death by any cause, From randomization date to death. The result is based on primary analysis data cut.|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR defined as the percentage of patients who have achieved CR, PR, or SD for \>= 16 weeks. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD), neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD., From the randomization date to first CR, PR or SD >= 16 weeks or the primary study completion date; up to 26.6 months.|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR defined as the percentage of patients who have achieved a confirmed CR, PR. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions., From randomization date to the first confirmed complete or partial response, or study completion date; up to 26.6 months.|PFS by Investigator Assessments, PFS defined as the time from randomization to the earliest date of the first objective documentation of radiographic disease progression or death due to any cause, based on Investigator assessments, disease progression or death|Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events Until Approximately 30 Days After the Last Study Drug, All AEs were collected from the initiation of study treatment until 30 days after the last administration study drug or until initiation of another anticancer therapy, whichever came first; up to 26.6 months., From first dose date to 30 days after the last dose date or the primary study completion date whichever came first; up to 26.6 months.
Approximately 160 patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive milademetan or trabectedin. Randomization will be stratified by the ECOG performance status (0 or 1) and number of prior treatments (≤ 2 or \> 2) for the patient's liposarcoma.

Patients will receive study drug (i.e., milademetan or trabectedin) until reaching unequivocal disease progression (RECIST v.1.1) as determined by the Investigator, experiencing unmanageable toxicity, or until other treatment discontinuation criteria are met. Patients may be treated beyond tumor progression if they are experiencing clinical benefit based on the assessment of the Investigator in discussion with the Medical Monitor. All patients will be followed for documentation of disease progression and survival information (i.e., date and cause of death) and subsequent treatment information (i.e., date/duration of treatment, response, and subsequent disease progression). Long-term follow-up will continue every 12 weeks (± 7 days) until the endpoint of death, the patient is lost to follow-up, or for 24 months following the final dose of study drug, whichever comes first.
