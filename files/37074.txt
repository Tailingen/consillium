A Study of BL-M07D1 Versus Investigator's Choice of Chemotherapy in Patients With HER2-low Recurrent/Metastatic Breast Cancer
This trial is a registered, phase III, randomized, open-label and multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BL-M07D1 in patients with unresectable, locally recurrent or metastatic HER2-low breast cancer.
HER2-low Breast Cancer
DRUG: BL-M07D1|DRUG: Capecitabine, Eribulin, Gemcitabine, Paclitaxel, or Albumin paclitaxel
Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by BICR is defined as the time between the date subjects were randomized and the first observation of disease progression (based on BICR's image-based assessment) or death., Up to approximately 24 months
Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time between the subject's randomization date and subject's death., Up to approximately 24 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the number of CR and PR in the treatment and control groups divided by the number of that group in the full analysis set (FAS)., Up to approximately 24 months|Duration of Response (DOR), Duration of Response (DOR) : defined as the period from the date when tumor response is first recorded to the date when objective tumor progression is first recorded or the date of death., Up to approximately 24 months|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), Clinical benefit ratio (CBR) is defined as the percentage of patients with advanced cancer who achieved complete remission, partial remission, or stable disease for at least 6 months after treatment., Up to approximately 24 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Disease Control Rate (DCR) : Percentage of all randomized subjects who rated the best overall response (BOR) as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), and disease stabilization (SD) according to RECIST 1.1 criteria., Up to approximately 24 months|Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE), TEAE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally emerging, or any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition during the treatment of BL-M07D1. The type, frequency and severity of TEAE will be evaluated during the treatment of BL-M07D1., Up to approximately 24 months|Anti-drug antibody (ADA), Frequency of anti-BL-M07D1 antibody (ADA) will be investigated., Up to approximately 24 months
