Phase I-II Study of Intratumoral Urelumab Combined With Nivolumab in Patients With Solid Tumors
Open label, phase I-II study to evaluate the safety and activity of intratumoral urelumab combined with systemic nivolumab in patients with advanced solid tumors. Serial tumor and blood samples will be obtained during the study to characterize the changes induced by treatment in the tumor microenvironment, as well as predictive biomarkers of response.
