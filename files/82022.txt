Docetaxel in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Persistent Endometrial Carcinoma (Cancer)
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well docetaxel works in treating patients with recurrent or persistent endometrial carcinoma (cancer).
Endometrial Cancer
DRUG: docetaxel
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the antitumor activity of docetaxel in patients with recurrent or persistent endometrial carcinoma.
* Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-51 patients will be accrued for this study within 10-18 months.
