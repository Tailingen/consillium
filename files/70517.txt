Optical Surface Guidance for External Radiotherapy of Head and Neck Cancer
The goal of this clinical trial is to test the use of surface repositioning alone, without a restraint mask, during radiotherapy sessions for patients with head and neck cancer.
Otorhinolaryngeal Cancer
PROCEDURE: Surface Guided RadioTherapy (SGRT) without mask
Measurement patient displacement during surface-guided radiotherapy sessions, Average length of linear translation vector during session (measured by surface cameras) over all sessions performed, Through study completion, an average of 1 year
In radiotherapy treatments for head and neck cancer, the use of a mask is recommended for patient immobilization. The mask completely covers the head and shoulders, ensuring reproducible positioning at every session. However, using a mask can be oppressive and anxiety-provoking for patients.

At the same time, technological developments have led us to use optical surface camera systems to position and monitor patients in the treatment room. In this way, if a movement exceeding the threshold is detected during a session, the treatment is automatically interrupted.

However, despite the use of the mask, movements are still possible underneath, and are not detected by the surface cameras.

The study's hypothesis is that the use of surface repositioning alone could guarantee reproducible treatment, as in combination with a thermoformed mask. In addition, eliminating the mask would mean greater comfort and improved quality of life for patients.
