Venetoclax, Ibrutinib, Prednisone, Obinutuzumab, and Revlimid (VIPOR) for Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma Involving the Central Nervous System
Background:

People with primary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the central nervous system (CNS) and aggressive B-cell lymphomas with secondary CNS involvement have a poor prognosis. Researchers want to learn if a combination of drugs can help.

Objective:

To learn if it is safe to give people with these cancers Nivolumab (VIPOR-Nivo).

Eligibility:

People aged 18 and older with B-cell lymphoma in the CNS that does not respond to treatment, response to treatment does not last long, or there is no standard treatment.

Design:

Participants will be screened with:

Health history

Physical exam

Blood, urine, and heart tests

Computed tomography (CT), fludeoxyglucose F18 (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Participants will lie in scanners that take pictures of the body. For some scans, a contrast or chemical agent will be injected into a vein.

Lumbar puncture or Ommaya tap. Participants will have a small needle inserted into their lower back or scalp to obtain fluid.

Possible tumor biopsy. Participants will have a needle inserted into a tumor to take a sample.

Participants will get the study drugs in 21-day cycles. They may have up to 6 treatment cycles. They will take some drugs by infusion into a vein and some drugs by mouth.

Participants will get counseling at least every 28 days on the risks of lenalidomide.

Participants will have visits throughout the study. Visits may include repeats of the screening tests. They may also include:

Bone marrow biopsy. Participants will have a needle inserted into their hipbone to remove marrow.

Saliva samples and cheek swabs

Participants will have periodic follow-up visits for about 10 years.

Proportion of Participants Who Completed at Least 2 Cycles of VIPOR (Venetoclax, Ibrutinib, Prednisone, Obinutuzumab, Lenalidomide) Therapy Without Stopping Due to Toxicity, The proportion of participants who complete at least 2 cycles of VIPOR (Venetoclax, Ibrutinib, Prednisone, Obinutuzumab, Lenalidomide) therapy without stopping due to toxicity will be determined and reported along with a 95% confidence interval. Success is defined as completing at least 2 cycles of VIPOR (Venetoclax, Ibrutinib, Prednisone, Obinutuzumab, Lenalidomide) therapy without the need to discontinue treatment due to toxicity (i.e., serious adverse event). A serious adverse event is an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that results in death, a life-threatening adverse drug experience, hospitalization, disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, congenital anomaly/birth defect or important medical events that jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the previous outcomes mentioned., After 2 Cycles (each cycle is 21 days)
Complete Response (CR), Complete response is disappearance of all detectable evidence of disease and disease-related symptoms measured by the Lugano criteria. The complete response rate of up to 6 cycles of VIPOR (Venetoclax, Ibrutinib, Prednisone, Obinutuzumab, Lenalidomide) in primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) and secondary central nervous system lymphoma (SCNSL) will be reported along with a 95% confidence interval., After cycles 3 and 6|Proportion of Participants Overall Response Rate (Complete Response + Partial Response) to VIPOR (Venetoclax, Ibrutinib, Prednisone, Obinutuzumab, Lenalidomide), The overall response rate of up to 6 cycles of VIPOR (Venetoclax, Ibrutinib, Prednisone, Obinutuzumab, Lenalidomide) in primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) and secondary central nervous system lymphoma (SCNSL) will be reported along with a 95% confidence interval. Complete response (CR) + Partial response (PR) was measured by the Lugano criteria. Complete response is disappearance of all detectable evidence of disease and disease-related symptoms. Partial response is a ≥50% decrease in the sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to 6 of the largest dominant nodes or nodal masses., After cycles 3 and 6|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the duration of time from the date of study enrollment until time of death from any cause, or 10 years post-treatment whichever occurs first. Overall survival (OS) after VIPOR (Venetoclax, Ibrutinib, Prednisone, Obinutuzumab, Lenalidomide) in primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) and secondary central nervous system lymphoma (SCNSL) will be determined using a Kaplan-Meier curve. The median will be determined and presented with its associated 95% confidence interval., Up to 2.6 years|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from the date of study enrollment until time of disease relapse, disease progression, death, or 10 years post-treatment, whichever occurs first. The progression-free survival (PFS) after VIPOR (Venetoclax, Ibrutinib, Prednisone, Obinutuzumab, Lenalidomide) in primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) and secondary central nervous system lymphoma (SCNSL) will be estimated using progression or death without progression as events, using a Kaplan-Meier curve. The median will be determined and presented with its associated 95% confidence interval. Progression was measured by the Lugano criteria and is appearance of any new nodal lesion ≥1.6 cm in greatest tumor dimension or ≥1.1 cm in short axis during or after the end of therapy, even if other lesions are decreasing in size., Up to 2.6 years|Duration of Response (DOR), The duration of response after VIPOR (Venetoclax, Ibrutinib, Prednisone, Obinutuzumab, Lenalidomide) in primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) and secondary central nervous system lymphoma (SCNSL) will be determined starting at the date a response is identified and will be estimated using a Kaplan-Meier curve along with a median DOR, and its associated 95% confidence interval. The duration of response (DOR) is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented, death, or, in the absence of progressive disease (PD), date of last assessment. CR is disappearance of all detectable evidence of disease and disease-related symptoms. PR is a ≥50% decrease in the sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to 6 of the largest dominant nodes or nodal masses. Progression is appearance of any new nodal lesion., From date of first response until the date of recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented, up to a max 2.6 years
Number of Participants With Serious and/or Non-serious Adverse Events Assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v5.0)., Here is the number of participants with serious and/or non-serious adverse events assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v5.0). A non-serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence. A serious adverse event is an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that results in death, a life-threatening adverse drug experience, hospitalization, disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, congenital anomaly/birth defect or important medical events that jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the previous outcomes mentioned., Adverse events were monitored/assessed from the date of first dose of any study drug, through 30 days after the last dose of any study drug after the last dose of any study drug. Participants were followed for a maximum duration of 2.6 years.

* Most CNS lymphomas (CNSL) exhibit molecular biology features of activated B cell diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (ABC DLBCL)
* We developed VIPOR (venetoclax, ibrutinib, prednisone, obinutuzumab, and lenalidomide \[Revlimid (Registered Trademark)\]) treatment in systemic lymphomas as a platform most effective for ABC DLBCL
* All agents in the VIPOR combination achieve meaningful CNS penetration and clinical activity for lymphomas involving the CNS

Study Design:

* A safety study of 10 evaluable participants with PCNSL or SCNSL treated with VIPOR (the original study protocol enrolled 4 participants to Cohort 1, Arm 1 consisting of VIPOR plus nivolumab which is now closed).
* Participants will receive VIPOR in 21-day cycles for a maximum of 6 cycles to collect data on safety and efficacy.
* Accrual ceiling will be set at 16 participants to allow for a few inevaluable participants or screen failures.
