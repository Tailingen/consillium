Enfortumab Vedotin and Pembrolizumab in People with Bladder Cancer
This study will test whether enfortumab vedotin combined with pembrolizumab is an effective treatment for people with bladder cancer (urothelial carcinoma) involving the lymph nodes who are going to have surgery to remove their cancer (cystectomy). The researchers will look at whether treatment with enfortumab vedotin and pembrolizumab before surgery can get rid of cancer within the lymph nodes. They will also try to find out if this combination of drugs is effective at shrinking participants' cancer before their surgery.

The researchers think that a combination of enfortumab vedotin and pembrolizumab may help people with this disease because both drugs are designed to help the immune system attack and kill cancer cells. The researchers think the drugs may be more effective if given in combination rather than on their own.
Urothelial Carcinoma
DRUG: Enfortumab vedotin|DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Pathologic complete response rate (pCR Rate), Defined as lack of muscle invasive carcinoma (\<pT2) and the absence of lymph node metastasis (N0) in the final cystectomy specimen. Pathologic complete response to perioperative treatment is defined as the absence of carcinoma (pT0) and the absence of lymph node metastases (N0). Pathologists will assess surgical specimens systematically using criteria agreed upon for all conventional neoadjuvant treatment based on the AJCC TNM staging system., 2 years
Event free survival (EFS), Event-free survival will be measured from the initiation of treatment. Any of the following events will qualify as an event:

* Primary progression of disease (from time of confirmatory scan)
* Recurrence of disease post-operatively with metastatic or local pelvic recurrence after radical cystectomy.
* Patients who do not proceed to cystectomy due to toxicity
* The assessment of disease recurrence versus development of a second primary tumor will be left to the discretion of the treating physician. If the patient did not progress nor die, the patient will be censored on the date of last follow-up, 2 years
