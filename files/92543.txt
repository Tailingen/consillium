Randomized Study of Train the Colonoscopy Leaders Course Versus Audit and Feedback on Colonoscopy Quality Indicators
Professional societies recommend that endoscopists measure their ceacal intubation rate, adenoma detection rate as indicators of the screening colonoscopy quality. However, it is uncertain how to improve adenoma detection rate and reduce inter-endoscopists' variability in the detection of adenomas. The investigators hypothesize that a hands-on-training intervention tailored to the results of environmental assessment and audit on colonoscopy quality indicators results in higher adenoma detection rate improvement than simple audit and feedback. The investigators further hypothesize that by training the leaders of the screening centres, the effect of the intervention will be further disseminated among other endoscopists from the participating centers, and will thus result in additional increase in individual adenoma detection rate.

The primary aim is to compare the impact on adenoma detection rate of two screening colonoscopy improvement programs:

1. Tailored training intervention.
2. Audit feedback on colonoscopy quality indicators.

PROCEDURE: Train the leaders course|BEHAVIORAL: Audit and feedback
Screening centre leader's adenoma detection rate, Adenoma detection rate is defined as the proportion of screened subjects in whom at least one adenomatous lesion is identified., till the end of calendar year after the training intervention
Screening center's overall adenoma detection rate, Adenoma detection rate is defined as the proportion of screened subjects in whom at least one adenomatous lesion is identified., Till the end of calendar year after the training intervention|Screening centre leader's proximal and distal adenoma detection rate, Adenoma detection rate is defined as the proportion of screened subjects in whom at least one adenomatous lesion is identified., Till the end of calendar year after the training intervention|Screening centre's non-polypoid lesion detection rate, Till the end of calendar year after the training intervention|Overall screening centre's ceacal intubation rate, Ceacal intubation is defined as the passage of the colonoscope tip to a point proximal to the ileoceacal valve and visualization of the entire ceacum., Till the end of calendar year after the training intervention|Screening centre leader's withdrawal technique, Withdrawal technique assessed by a trained endoscopy nurse, Till the end of calendar year after the training intervention
