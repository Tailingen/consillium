Resiliency Training for Patients With NF2 Via Videoconferencing With Skype
The aim of this study is to determine, whether the 3RP is feasible, accepted and efficacious and durable when delivered via Skype to patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) who are deaf or have severe hearing loss using Communication Access Realtime Translation (CART) and/or American Sign Language (ASL).

This will be a substudy of the IRB-approved protocol #2013P002605. It is the same study except it is looking at a particular sub-population: patients with NF2 who are hard of hearing.

Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), The PSS is a widely used psychological instrument for the measurement of the perception of stress.

The scores range from 0-40, with a higher score indicating higher perceived stress. Items were designed to detect how unpredictable, uncontrollable and overloaded respondents find their lives., Change between Baseline (week 0), Post-intervention (week 8) and Follow Up (week 32)|The 14-Item Resiliency Scale (RS-14), The RS-14 measures stress coping ability in the face of adversity., Change between Baseline (week 0), Post-intervention (week 8) and Follow Up (week 32)|Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ), The PHQ measures symptoms of depression and functional impairment., Change between Baseline (week 0), Post-intervention (week 8) and Follow Up (week 32)|Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale (CAMS), The CAMS measures the degree to which individuals experience their thoughts and feelings., Change between Baseline (week 0), Post-intervention (week 8) and Follow Up (week 32)|Life Orientation Test (LOT) Optimism Scale, The LOT Optimism Scale measures individual differences in generalized optimism versus pessimism., Change between Baseline (week 0), Post-intervention (week 8) and Follow Up (week 32)|The Gratitude Questionnaire (GQ-6), The GQ-6 revised is a 6-item measure that assesses individual differences in the proneness to experience gratitude in daily life. Scores range from 6-42, with a higher score indicating a greater sense of gratitude., Change between Baseline (week 0), Post-intervention (week 8) and Follow Up (week 32)|Measure of Current Status (MOCS-A), The MOCS-A is a 13-item measure assessing participants' current self-perceived status on several skills such as: the ability to relax at will, recognize stress-inducing situations, restructure maladaptive thoughts, be assertive about needs, and choose appropriate coping responses as needed. Responses are made on a 7-point scale with higher scores reflecting higher life satisfaction., Change between Baseline (week 0), Post-intervention (week 8) and Follow Up (week 32)|Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Social Support Survey, The MOS Social Support Survey measures various dimensions of social support., Change between Baseline (week 0), Post-intervention (week 8) and Follow Up (week 32)
Intent to Attend, Measures how likely and how motivated the participants is to attend the next session., Baseline (week 0)|Date of Birth, Age, Gender, Race, Ethnicity, Marital Status, Education Status, Employment Status, and hearing status of subjects with NF2, This questionnaire asks subjects with NF2 to report their date of birth, age, gender, race, ethnicity, marital status, highest level of education, hearing status, and primary employment status over the last 12 months., Baseline (week 0)|Credibility Questionnaire, Measures how much the participant believes the intervention will work., Baseline (week 0)|Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8), Measures how satisfied the participant is with the intervention., Post-intervention (week 8)
