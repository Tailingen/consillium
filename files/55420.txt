Neoadjuvant IMRT Combined With Camrelizumab and Apatinib for Resectable HCC With PVTT
This study is an open-label, single-arm prospective clinical trial that evaluates the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant intensity-modulated radiotherapy combined with perioperative camrelizumab and apatinib in the treatment of resectable hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein tumor thrombus.

1-year Event-Free Survival (EFS) rate, EFS is defined as the time from the start of study treatment to the occurrence of tumor progression, relapse assessed by the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST) criteria, death for any reason, or last follow-up (whichever occurs first)., 1 year
Event-Free Survival (EFS), EFS is defined as the time from the start of study treatment to the occurrence of tumor progression, relapse assessed by the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST) criteria, death for any reason, or last follow-up (whichever occurs first)., up to 2 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the start of study treatment to death for any reason or the last follow-up (whichever occurs first)., up to 2 years|Disease-Free Survival (DFS), DFS is defined as the time from hepatectomy to tumor progression, relapse assessed by mRECIST standards, death for any reason, or last follow-up (whichever occurs first)., up to 2 years|R0 resection rate, Major Pathological Response, defined as â‰¤10% viable tumor tissue in the surgical specimen at the time of tumor resection, up to 3 months|Overall Objective Response of primary liver tumor and PVTT, The assessment of primary liver tumors is consistent with mRECIST criteria; for PVTT, any downstaging in the Cheng's PVTT classification or any conspicuous restoration of blood flow in the portal vein were regarded as partial remission (PR) and any upstaging in the PVTT classification as progressive disease (PD). Otherwise, these outcomes are defined as Stable Disease (SD). If either primary liver tumor or PVTT is classified as PD, the overall response is defined as PD; if either the primary liver tumor or PVTT is PR and the other is SD, it is defined as PR., up to 3 months
Surgical safety, 30-day mortality rate post-surgery, surgical complications, reoperation rate, postoperative hospital stay, readmission rate., up to 3 months|Safety of radiotherapy, camrelizumab and apatinib treatment, the incidence and severity of adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE) were determined according to NCI-CTCAE v5.0, up to 2 years|Exploratory Endpoints, the potential association between changes in the tumor microenvironment and biomarkers with the efficacy of neoadjuvant intensity-modulated radiotherapy combined with perioperative camrelizumab and apatinib treatment., up to 2 years
