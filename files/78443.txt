FGFR Inhibitor ET0111 Monotherapy in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a Phase I, open-label, multi-center, dose-finding study to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of ET0111 in patients with advanced solid tumors. It is anticipated that approximately 37 subjects will be enrolled in the dose-escalation phase of the study. ET0111 will be administered orally once daily (QD) in 21-day treatment cycles.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: ET0111
Determination of Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of ET0111, MTD based on Number of participants with dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) in the dose escalation phase. A DLT is defined as any toxicity not attributable to the disease or disease-related processes under investigation, which occurs before the end of Cycle 1 (21 days as a cycle), Approximately 2 years|Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D), RP2D may be the same dose level or lower than the determined MTD, Approximately 2 years|Number of participants with adverse events, All patients participating in this study will be assessed for incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs, including changes in laboratory values, vital signs, electrocardiograms, cardiac imaging and ophthalmological assessments, Approximately 2 years
Area under the curve, Area under the plasma concentration time curve of ET0111, Approximately 2 years|Cmax, Highest observed plasma concentration of ET0111, Approximately 2 years|Tmax, Time of highest observed plasma concentration of ET0111, Approximately 2 years|T1/2, Half life of ET0111, Approximately 2 years|Objective response rate, Objective response rate, Approximately 2 years|Duration of response, DOR is defined as the time from the participant's initial objective response (CR or PR) to study drug therapy, to disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Approximately 2 years|Disease Control Rate, DCR is defined as the percentage of patients who achieved remission (PR+CR) and stabilization (SD) after treatment in evaluable cases., Approximately 2 years|Progression-free survival, PFS is defined as the time between the onset of randomization and the onset (of any aspect) of tumor progression or death (from any cause)., Approximately 2 years|Overall survival, OS is defined as the time between the beginning of randomization and the death of the patient from any cause, Approximately 2 years
blood phosphorus, On treatment versus baseline comparison of blood phosphorus, Approximately 2 years|ET0111 metabolites identification, ET0111 metabolites identify and analysis, Approximately 2 years|NGS test of FGF/FGFR, Next-generation sequencing (NGS) test will be performed with the tumor tissues or plasma ctDNA collected before ET0111 treatment, to detect FGF/FGFR gene alterations . Detected gene alteration data (including but not limited to mutation, insertion, deletion, amplification, translocation...) will be further analyzed for correlation with the anti-tumor activity of ET0111., Approximately 2 years
