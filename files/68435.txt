Gemcitabine, Cisplatin, and Celecoxib Treatment of Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
This study will examine an investigational (experimental) treatment using gemcitabine, cisplatin, and celecoxib. Preliminary studies have shown that this experimental treatment may be effective in reducing the size of cancerous tumors and/or preventing further tumor growth.

This is a phase II clinical trial studying the reactions of the patient's body and their tumor to the combination of gemcitabine, cisplatin, and celecoxib. The purpose of this study is to see if the tumor responds to this treatment and to determine how long the response lasts. This study will also look at what kind of side effects this experimental treatment causes and see how often these side effects occur. Blood levels of celecoxib will be measured to find out how this treatment affects factors (proteins) involved in new blood vessel formation and tumor growth (angiogenesis).
