Supplemental High Flow Oxygen to Reduce Infections in Obese Gynecological Cancer Patients
The incidence of surgical-site infection (SSI) and complications related to wound healing reaches 10-20% of gynecological cancer patients. Each complication may dramatically prolong the hospitalization period and increase the economic burden of hospital care. Appropriate wound care and tissue oxygenation are of special importance for wound healing. Assuming adequate perfusion, the easiest, safest, and most effective way to improve tissue oxygenation is to increase the fraction of inspired oxygen. However, there is considerable controversy as to whether supplemental oxygen actually reduces SSI and healing-related complications as to date, there is absence of relevant data.

Infectious morbidity, Other infectious morbidity, including urinary tract, pulmonary and gastrointestinal infections will be recorded, Within 30 days from the operation|Postoperative morbidity, Postoperative morbidity non-related to SSI will be documented using the Clavien-Dindo scaling score, Within 30 days from the operation|Non-SSI related hospital readmissions, Hospital readmission rates that are not attributed to SSIs will be documented, Within 30 days from the operation
This study aims to investigate the prophylactic value of postoperative oxygen administration against the development of wound infections in obese gynecological oncology patients undergoing laparotomy for the treatment of endometrial or ovarian cancer. At the same time, the factors that lead to an increase in this risk will be outlined.
