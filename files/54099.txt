Basal ganglion hemorrhage is one of the most common subtypes of cerebral hemorrhage, characterized by high morbidity, mortality, and disability rates. Minimally invasive surgery for cerebral hemorrhage, particularly utilizing a fiber tract-based AI Robot Guiding System, has shown potential advantages for patient prognosis. However, there is currently no standardized practice or robust evidence confirming the effectiveness and safety of this technology for small-volume basal ganglion hemorrhage. Therefore, we are conducting a nationwide, prospective, multicenter randomized controlled clinical trial to evaluate the therapeutic effects of the fiber tract-based artificial intelligence (AI) Robot Guiding System on the perioperative and long-term recovery of patients with moderate-volume basal ganglion hemorrhage.
