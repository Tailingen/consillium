Neoadjuvant Intralesional Injection of Talimogene Laherparepvec
The proposed study is designed to treat locally advanced soft tissue sarcoma (STS) subtypes with neoadjuvant talimogene laherparepvec (TVEC) and preoperative external beam radiation therapy (EBRT).

Adverse Events will be evaluated according to CTCAE version 4.0, Initiation of treatment through Week 16|ORR defined as the proportion of subjects with a complete or partial response, Initiation of treatment through Week 12|TTP defined as time from first day of study treatment to first documented disease progression, Initiation of treatment through Week 12|Overall Survival defined as time from first day of study treatment to death due to any cause, Initiation of treatment through 5 years
This is a single-arm open-label phase Ib and phase II clinical study assessing the safety and relative efficacy of concurrent talimogene laherparepvec in combination with radiotherapy in patients with soft tissue sarcomas. Patients will be treated with neoadjuvant radiation and weekly intratumoral injections of talimogene laherparepvec. Weekly injections of talimogene laherparepvec will be continued until surgery. Surgery will be performed 4-6 weeks from the end of radiation therapy to allow for resolution of acute toxicities per current standard of care.
