It is a retrospective review of the electronic medical record of patients on long-acting triptorelin in Hong Kong.
Prostate Cancer
The usage pattern of the long-acting Gonadotropin-releasing Hormone Agonist agonist triptorelin in real-life clinical practice, The duration and type of GnRH agonist, 6 months
The effectiveness of the long-acting Gonadotropin-releasing Hormone Agonist agonist triptorelin in inducing and maintaining castration, It is assessed by the PSA , testosterone level, 6 months
Prostate cancer is the second most prevalent cancer in men worldwide. Analogues of natural gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) are currently available in clinical practice to induce castration in subjects with prostate cancer. While 6 month formulation of Triptorelin has been approved since 2018 for controlling tumor growth in subjects with prostate cancer living in Hong Kong, to date, there are no published clinical data regarding the use and efficacy of the 6 month formulation in Chinese subjects with Chinese heritage. To better understand the real-world experience of long-acting GnRH agonist, there is an unmet need for a retrospective, noninterventional review to collect data regarding the use of the long-acting formulation GnRH in clinical practice as a treatment for prostate cancer. The purpose of this study is to collect data on healthcare characteristics and the treatment patterns in the real-world setting, as well as to understand the profile of the subject population using long-acting formulation GnRH agonist.
