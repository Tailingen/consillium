Study Evaluating Dosimetry, Randomized Dose Optimization, Dose Escalation and Efficacy of Ac-225 Rosopatamab Tetraxetan in Participants With PSMA PET-Positive Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC)
This is a three-part study evaluating the safety and efficacy of a PSMA-directed radioantibody (rosopatamab tetraxetan, conjugated to either In-111 or Ac-225). Part 1 will consist of one administration of In-111-rosopatamab tetraxetan to characterize the biodistribution of the radioantibody to target organs and prostate cancer lesions. Participants then will be enrolled into either Part 2 (Dose Optimization) or Part 3 (Dose Escalation and Expansion) depending on their prior treatment history. Participants qualifying for Part 2 will be randomized to receive Ac-225 rosopatamab tetraxetan in a single fractionated cycle (dose administration on Day 1 and Day 15) at either 45 or 60 kBq/Kg. Participants qualifying for Part 3 must have received prior Lu-177-PSMA-radioligand therapy and will receive Ac-225 rosopatamab tetraxetan in a single fractionated cycle at 45, 55, or 60 kBq/Kg. Dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) will be monitored in Part 3 to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), and the study may enroll additional participants to be treated with the RP2D dose level. Participants enrolled into any part will attend study visits which will include blood samples, electrocardiogram (ECG), radiographic imaging, and physical examinations along with other assessments.
