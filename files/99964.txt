HEM1036 Phase 2 Study in Low Anterior Resection Syndrome
Double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled phase 2 study to explore the efficacy and safety of HEM1036 in the treatment of subjects with LARS
LARS - Low Anterior Resection Syndrome
DRUG: Lactobacillus Fermentum|DRUG: Placebo
Change in Low Anterior Resection Syndrome score from Baseline to 8 weeks, * Higher score means worse outcome
* We will assess the change of LARS score at 8 weeks frome baseline. The change of LARS score of two treatment groups will be compared., Baseline to 8 weeks
Change in QoL(Quality of Life) score from Baseline to 8 weeks, Score 0-100(higher score means better outcome), Baseline to 8 weeks|Change in fecal microbiota composition assessed by alpha-diversity and differential abundance analysis, Baseline to 4, 8 weeks|Change of fecal metabolites assessed by fecal analysis, Change of metabolites (including Total short-chain fatty acids, acetate, butyrate,propionate, lactate, bile acids in fecal samples) assessed by fecal analysis and all parameters will be presented as umol/g, Baseline to 4, 8 weeks
The study will be conducted as a double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled phase 2 study to explore the efficacy and safety of HEM1036 in the treatment of subjects with LARS. Subjects will be males and females ≥18 and ≤75 years of age with LARS. Subjects must have a LARS score of \>20 at the Screening Visit after sphincter preserving rectal resection surgery for the curative treatment of diagnosed rectal cancer.
