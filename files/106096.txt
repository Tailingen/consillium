Defining the Radiotherapy Dose and Volume Parameters Affecting Postoperative Complications in Esophageal Cancer Patients
The purpose of this study is to identify features of the cumulative dose-volume histogram (DVH) for patients treated with trimodality therapy in oesophageal cancer and correlate these with postoperative complications.
Esophageal Cancer
OTHER: Trimodality protocol
Postoperative complications, Cardiac complications (arrhythmia etc )

* Respiratory complications (pneumonia, pleural effusion etc)
* Anastomotic leakage
* Postoperative 30-day mortality
* Total postoperative mortality
* Treatment-related mortality
* Hospitalization and stay at intensive care unit duration, within 30 and 90 Days after operation
Intention to treat analysis in patients initially assigned to be treated with the trimodality protocol: neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery.

The investigators will retrospectively evaluate several parameters of the treatment planning of patients treated with a preoperative regimen (CROSS regimen 41,4 Gy in 23 fractions or 50, 4 Gy in 28 fractions ):

* PTV volume1
* MLD, V30, V20, V15, V10, VS5 (Volume lung less dan 5 Gy)2 (lung toxicity)
* MHD, V20, V30, V403 (heart toxicity)
* Mean stomach dose, V50 stomach
* Mitochondrial DNA if available per patient Pre-existing cardiac,pulmonary comorbidity, smoking behavior, BMI, type of surgery and chemotherapy (especially taxanes) will be scored and take into account in a multivariate analysis. The investigators will collect these data and correlate the data with the presence of postoperative complications, time of onset of complications and duration of hospitalization. These latter data are already scored in a prospective manner at the Atrium Medical Center in Heerlen.
