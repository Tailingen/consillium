Transrectal Vacuum Assisted Drainage: A New Method of Treating Anastomotic Leakage After Rectal Resection
Anastomotic leakage is a major and potentially mortal complication with an incidence of 10-13% after resection of the rectum. For patients showing no clinical signs of peritonitis, the traditional method has been a conservative treatment with transrectal rinsing. This treatment is often associated with a very protracted postoperative course with healing times of up to a year or more for the anastomotic leakage.

Treatment with vacuum drainage (VD) is a new method primarily developed for wound therapy.

The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of transrectal vacuum treatment on the healing of anastomotic leakage after rectum resection in a prospective, randomized, controlled multicentre trial in 60 patients found to develop clinically significant anastomotic leakages after elective rectal resection.
Colorectal Surgery
PROCEDURE: Transrectal vacuum assisted drainage
Healing time of the anastomotic leakage, 1 year
Salvage surgery (abdominal reoperation with debridement of anastomosis), 1 month|Duration of fever and antibiotic treatment, 2 months|Duration of hospital stay, 2 monts|Number of visits in the outpatient clinic / number of sponge changes, 8 weeks|Functional result, defined as +/- closure of temporary ileostomy, 2 years|Functional result evaluated by examination of the anal physiology in a smaller patient population (supplementary trial protocol), 2 years
