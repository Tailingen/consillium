Immunochemotherapy, Surgery or Chemoradiation, and Durvalumab for Stage IIIA/B NSCLC
The hypothesis of the study is that induction immunochemotherapy, followed by surgery or chemoradiation and consolidation Durvalumab immunotherapy, can significantly improve event-free survival in patients with resectable or borderline resectable NSCLC at stage IIIA/B compared to existing treatment methods.
