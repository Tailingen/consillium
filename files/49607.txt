Phase 1a/1b BGB-290 for Advanced Solid Tumors.
The study contains Phase 1A and Phase 1B. Phase 1A has Part1 (BID Dose Escalation) and Part2 (QD Dosing Escalation) Evaluation of a cohort of at least three participants completing one cycle of treatment at that dose level and dose regimen is required prior to determining the next dose level and dose regimen for the next cohort. Phase 1B has PartA (BID Dosing Expansion) will investigate efficacy in participants with selected tumor types and further evaluate safety and tolerability of BGB 290 at recommended dose for future studies. and PartB (Food Effect) will investigate the food effect on the Pharmacokinetics (PK) of BGB 290 in participants with advanced solid tumors.

Objective response rate ([ORR]: Complete Response (CR) + Partial Response (PR)) based on RECIST Version 1.1, The primary endpoint of the study was a composite response rate that included ORR, a ≥50% decrease in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and/or a decrease in circulating tumor cells., through study completion, an average of 1 year|Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response (for prostate cancer participants only) based on Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 (PCWG2) criteria, The primary endpoint of the study was a composite response rate that included ORR, a ≥50% decrease in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and/or a decrease in circulating tumor cells., through study completion, an average of 1 year|Primary PK 1, Primary PK parameter is area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) from time 0 to the time of the last quantifiable concentration (AUClast)., through study completion, an average of 1 year|Primary PK 2, Primary PK parameter is area under plasma concentration time curve (AUC)., through study completion, an average of 1 year|Primary PK 3, Primary PK parameter is maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax)., through study completion, an average of 1 year
Progression free survival, Participants, who are withdrawn from the study without documented progression, will be censored at the date of the last tumor assessment when the participant was known to be progression free. Participants without post screening tumor assessments, but known to be alive will be censored at the time of the first administration of BGB 290)., through study completion, an average of 1 year|Duration of response for responders (CR or PR) and duration of SD (defined only for participants whose confirmed best response is CR, PR, or SD., For participants who are alive without progression following the qualifying response, duration of response will be censored on the date of last evaluable tumor assessment or last follow up for progression of disease)., through study completion, an average of 1 year|The number and proportion of participants who achieve objective tumor response (complete response [CR], partial response [PR], and CR+PR) or stable disease (SD)., For ovarian cancer participants, tumor responses may also be evaluated using RECIST Version 1.1 combined with CA-125 based on the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup (GCIG) criteria. For participants with prostate cancer, PCWG2 criteria may be used to evaluate responses by investigators., through study completion, an average of 1 year
