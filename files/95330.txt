Polycythemia Vera, Myelofibrosis and Essential Thrombocythemia: Identification of PV, MF & ET Genes
The purpose of this project is to find genes whose mutations cause Polycythemia Vera, Essential Thrombocythemia and Primary Myelofibrosis.

Identify genes whose mutations cause Polycythemia Vera, Essential Thrombocythemia and Primary Myelofibrosis., Weekly
To determine if there are proteins expressed by cells from patients that might be targets for the immune response., Weekly
Polycythemia Vera (PV), Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) and Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF), also known as the Philadelphia Chromosome negative myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs), are not congenital, but acquired. The purpose of this project is to find genes whose mutations cause these disorders, as well as improve diagnostic measures for these diseases. When this is accomplished new therapies to control and eventually cure the disease can be designed.

All subjects will be asked to donate 4-6 teaspoons of blood. On occasion, if the blood cells from a particular sample do not grow well and the DNA from that sample is used up or other tests are needed, we may ask to collect additional samples. In patients who have undergone a bone marrow biopsy as part of their clinical evaluation, we will test the reproducibility between pathologists for the revised 2008 WHO diagnostic criteria to diagnose myeloproliferative disorders (MPD).
