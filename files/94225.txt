The Function of PET Molecular Imaging Targeting Fibroblast Activation Protein in the Hepatobiliary Malignancies
Patients with high clinical suspicion of hepatobiliary malignancies should undergo PET/CT examination with two imaging agents, 68Ga-FAPI (fibroblast activation protein inhibitor) and 18F-FDG within one week, and collect tumor tissue. Finally, the PET/CT results were compared with the pathology report to evaluate the role of 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT imaging in the diagnosis of hepatobiliary malignancies

Patients with high clinical suspicion of hepatobiliary malignancies should undergo PET/CT examination with two imaging agents, 68Ga-FAPI (fibroblast activation protein inhibitor) and 18F-FDG within one week. After comprehensive clinical evaluation, if the patient can be treated with surgery, surgery will be performed, and the patient's pathological specimens will be collected after surgery ; If the patient has no possibility of surgery, ultrasound-guided needle biopsy is performed, and biopsy specimens are collected. Finally, the PET/CT results were compared with the pathology report to evaluate the application value of 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT imaging in the diagnosis and staging of hepatobiliary malignant tumors, and to analyze the guiding significance for the treatment decision of hepatobiliary malignant tumors.
