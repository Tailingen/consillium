A Study of Anlotinib Hydrochloride Capsule Combined With AK105 Injection in Subject With Advanced Gastric and Gastro-oesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma
This is a randomized, controlled, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate efficacy of AK105 injection combined with Anlotinib Hydrochloride Capsules versus standard second-line chemotherapy. Patients are treated with AK105 injection combined with Anlotinib Hydrochloride Capsules or standard second-line chemotherapy, with 1:1 random ratio.

DRUG: Anlotinib hydrochloride capsule|DRUG: AK105 injection|DRUG: Paclitaxel injection|DRUG: Docetaxel injection
Overall survival (OS), OS defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause. Subjects who do not die at the end of the extended follow-up period, or were lost to follow-up during the study, were censored at the last date they were known to be alive., up to 45 weeks
Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS defined as the time from randomization until the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause., up to 45 weeks|Overall response rate (ORR), Percentage of subjects achieving complete response (CR) and partial response (PR)., up to 45 weeks|Disease control rate (DCR), Percentage of subjects achieving complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD)., up to 45 weeks|Duration of response (DOR), DOR defined as time from earliest date of disease response to earliest date of disease progression based on radiographic assessment., up to 45 weeks
