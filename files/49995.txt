Tranexamic Acid in Surgery of Advanced Ovarian Cancer
The purpose of the study is to determine if a standardized single dose tranexamic acid given intravenously immediately preoperatively reduces the perioperative bleeding volume and reduces the need of blood transfusion in women undergoing surgery for advanced ovarian cancer.
Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: Tranexamic acid|DRUG: 0.9% NaCl solution
Perioperative Bleeding Volume, Estimation of total blood loss was based on the estimation of the Hb balance method (Brecher, et al.1997) with the assumption that the body blood volume was normalised on the fifth postoperative day. The haemoglobin level was assessed preoperatively and on the fifth postoperative day. The predicted blood volume (PBV, l) was calculated according to the method described by Nadler et al. (1962), using body weight and height. The extravasation of haemoglobin was calculated taking into account allogenic transfused haemoglobin. Total blood loss perioperatively was related to the patient's preoperative haemoglobin value. Blood loss due to haematomas or a reoperation within the first five days after surgery was also considered., From start of operation to discharge from hospital, up to 5 weeks
Number of Patients Receiving Blood Transfusions, Total number of RBC-transfused women in each group, From start of operation to discharge from hospital, up to 5 weeks|Number of Units of Red Blood Cells (RBC) Transfused, Total number of red blood cells (RBC) transfused across all participants, From start of operation to discharge from hospital, up to 5 weeks|Median Number of Transfused Units of Red Blood Cells (RBC), Median number of red blood cells transfused among those who received RBC transfusions, From start of operation to discharge from hospital, up to 5 weeks|Number of Patients With Clinically or Radiologically Verified Thromboembolic Events Within 5 Weeks Postoperatively, Thromboembolic events including arterial thrombosis, muscle vein thrombosis, superficial and deep venous thrombosis., From time of operation to 5 weeks postoperatively.
