Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation: a Cautionary Event After Liver Transplantation for Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Highly active hepatitis B virus (HBV) is known to be associated with poor outcomes in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aims to investigate the relationship between HBV status and HCC recurrence after liver transplantation. The study retrospectively analyzed HCC patients undergoing liver transplantation in 2 centers between January 2015 and December 2020. We reviewed post-transplant HBV status and its association with outcomes.
