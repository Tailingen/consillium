Capnographic Monitoring in Gastrointestinal Endoscopy for Elderly Patients
Hypoxia is the most common adverse event in gastrointestinal endoscopes sedated with propofol and sufentanil, especially in elderly people. The aim of this randomized study was to determine whether intervention based on additional capnographic monitoring reduces the incidence of hypoxia in gastrointestinal endoscopes procedures for elderly patients.

The incidence of hypoxia, (75% ≤ SpO2 \< 90% for \<60 s), Patients will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 2 hours
The incidence of sub-clinical respiratory depression, (90% ≤ SpO2 \< 95%), Patients will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average about 2 hours|The incidence of severe hypoxia, (SpO2 \< 75% or 75% ≤ SpO2 \< 90% for \>/=60 s), Patients will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average about 2 hours|The incidence of capnography curve decreased by half or more than the baseline and even disappeared without hypoxia, capnography curve decreased by half or more than the baseline and even disappeared, SpO2 \>90%, Patients will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average about 2 hours|The incidence of other adverse events, Other adverse events recorded by tools proposed by the World Society of Intravenous Anesthesia International Sedation Task Force, Patients will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average about 2 hours
