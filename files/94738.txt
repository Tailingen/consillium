Optimizing Body Mass Index (BMI) With TCMCB07, The Paradox Trial
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of B07, administered daily by subcutaneous (SC) injection, in up to 100 patients with newly diagnosed metastatic colorectal cancer. This study will evaluate different doses of B07 on weight, body composition and BMI in patients with sub-optimal BMIs (18 to ≤ 29 kg/m2). Treatment will begin on the same day as the start of cancer chemotherapy and continue during the first 28 days of cytotoxic therapy with a goal of preserving muscle and fat mass, relative to placebo control.
