A Study of AT13387 in Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Alone and in Combination With Crizotinib
The purpose of the study is to evaluate safety and efficacy of AT13387 Alone and in Combination with Crizotinib in the Treatment of Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer(NSCLC)
DRUG: AT13387|DRUG: Crizotinib
Part A: The incidence of dose limiting toxicities when AT13387 is administered in combination with crizotinib., - Number of patients with adverse events, 12 months|Part B: The comparison of objective response rate by RECIST 1.1 between crizotinib alone and the combination of crizotinib + AT13387., - Change in tumor measurements by RECIST 1.1 every 8 weeks, 18 months|Part C: The objective overall response rate for AT13387 alone and the objective response rate (CR+PR) for AT13387 + crizotinib at Stage 1 and Stage 2 of the Simon's 2-stage design., - Change in tumor measurements by RECIST 1.1 every 8 weeks, 18 months
Part A: Pharmacokinetics of combination treatment with AT13387 and crizotinib, * Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) of AT13387 and crizotinib alone and in combination Week 4
* Maximum concentration (Cmax) OF AT13387 and crizotinib alone and in combination by Week 4, 12 months|Part A: Assess antitumor activity of crizotinib + AT13387 combination, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) response, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)., * Change in tumor measurements by RECIST 1.1 every 8 weeks
* Change in CTCs from baseline every 4 weeks
* Assessment of PFS and OS as measured by weeks, 12 months|Part B: Assess safety of AT13387 in combination with crizotinib; compare PFS and OS between crizotinib and crizotinib + AT13387; and assess overall response rate (CR + PR) in crizotinib patients who crossover to crizotinib + AT13387, * Number of patients with adverse events
* PFS and OS as measured in weeks
* Response rate as measured by RECIST 1.1 every 8 weeks, 18 months|Part C: Assess safety of AT13387 alone and in combination with crizotinib who progressed on crizotinib treatment; and compare the PFS and OS of AT13387 administered alone or in combination with crizotinib, * Number of patients with adverse events
* PFS and OS as measured in weeks, 18 months
This is a 3-part phase 1-2 study in patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) + or other potentially crizotinib-sensitive NSCLC who have been receiving crizotinib. Part A is a single-arm, Phase 1, open-label, dose escalation design in patients with NSCLC who have already been receiving crizotinib for at least 8 weeks and continue to tolerate therapy. Part B is a Phase 2, open-label, randomized continuation design comparing crizotinib alone versus the combination of crizotinib + AT13387 at the maximum tolerated dose established in Part A. Part C is an open-label, randomized, Phase 2, Simon's 2 stage design evaluating single agent AT13387 or combination AT13387 + crizotinib at the MTD established in Part A in patients who progressed on crizotinib at any time.
