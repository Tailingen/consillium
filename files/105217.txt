A Study of Azenosertib (ZN-c3) in Subjects With Platinum-Resistant High-Grade Serous Ovarian, Fallopian Tube or Primary Peritoneal Cancer
This is a multi-part Phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of azenosertib (ZN-c3) in subjects with Platinum-Resistant, High-Grade Serous Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer. Part 2 of the study will be conducted in subjects whose tumors are Cyclin E1 positive as determined by central review using the Sponsor's investigational clinical trial assay.

Duration of response (DOR) defined by RECIST v1.1 [Part 2], Time from the date of first documented response (CR or PR that is subsequently confirmed per RECIST v1.1) until the date of progressive disease (PD) or death., Up to approximately 12 months from the enrollment of the last subject|Progression free survival (PFS) defined by RECIST v1.1 [Part 2], Time from the date of first dose until the date of PD or death., Up to approximately 12 months from the enrollment of the last subject|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) defined by RECIST v1.1 [Part 2], The percentage of participants who have at least 1 confirmed response of CR or PR, or stable disease for at least 16 weeks before any evidence of progression., Up to approximately 12 months from the enrollment of the last subject|CA-125 response by GCIG criteria [Part 2], The GCIG CA-125 response was defined as at least 50% reduction in CA-125 levels from baseline., Up to approximately 12 months from the enrollment of the last subject|Number of Subjects experiencing treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) [Part 2], Up to approximately 12 months from the enrollment of the last subject
A Phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of azenossertib (ZN-c3) in subjects with Platinum-Resistant, High-Grade Serous Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer. Azenosertib is a selective and orally bioavailable inhibitor of WEE1. By inhibiting WEE1, azenosertib enables cell cycle progression, despite high levels of DNA damage, thereby resulting in the accumulation of DNA damage leading to mitotic catastrophe and cancer cell death.

The study consists of two parts:

Part 1: All comers, no biomarker status required (completed enrollment)

Part 2: Cyclin E1 positive protein expression required
