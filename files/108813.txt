A Study of CAR-T Cells Targeting GPRC5D in the Treatment of r/r Multiple Myeloma
This is a single-arm, open-label, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, cellular kinetics and initial efficacy of CAR-T cell therapy targeting GPRC5D in multiple myeloma subjects who have failed the standard treatments.
