Effects of Sulforaphane on Normal Prostate Tissue
The investigators proposed to identify the biological effects of a high-sulforaphane broccoli sprout extract in normal prostate tissue.

The investigators hypothesize that consumption of high-sulforaphane broccoli sprout extract every other day will inhibit growth of prostate cancer cells.
