Prevention of CHOP-induced Chronic Cardiotoxicity
The purpose of this study is to assess the protective effect of Valsartan on chronic cardiotoxicity induced by CHOP.
Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
DRUG: Valsartan
Cardiac Event after 3rd and 6th course of CHOP(-R), Basically 14-21 (at a maximum 28) days after the start of 3rd and 6th course of CHOP(-R).
Changes of ECG, UCG and serum markers after 3 and 6 courses of CHOP (-R), 14-21 (at a maximum 28) days after the start of 3rd and 6th course of CHOP(-R).
Doxorubicin has been one of the most important key drugs in treatment for malignancies. However, its use is limited by dose-dependent cumulative cardiotoxicity. This multi-centers trial was designed to investigate the preventive effect of Valsartan, the angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker (ARB) on chronic cardiotoxicity due to doxorubicin based chemotherapy. Patients with untreated non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who are scheduled to receive at least 6 courses of the standard CHOP (-R) will be randomized by the minimization methods to the treatment group with Valsartan (80mg once daily by oral during entire 6 courses of CHOP) or control group. Cardiac function will be evaluated in detail before and after 3 and 6 courses of CHOP (-R).
