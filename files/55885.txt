The UK Plasma Based Molecular Profiling of Advanced Breast Cancer to Inform Therapeutic CHoices (plasmaMATCH) Trial
plasmaMATCH is a multi-centre phase IIa umbrella trial platform consisting of a ctDNA screening component and a therapeutic component. plasmaMATCH aims to assess whether ctDNA screening can be used to detect patient subgroups who will be sensitive to targeted therapies, and will also assess the safety and activity of the targeted treatments.

The primary endpoint for Cohorts A to E is confirmed objective response rate as defined by RECIST v1.1 for each cohort separately, up to 24 weeks
Clinical benefit rate, A patient will be defined as having clinical benefit if they have either a complete/partial response or stable disease as defined by RECIST v1.1 lasting at least 24 weeks., up to 24 weeks|Progression free survival, PFS will be measured from the date of entry into the treatment cohort until first date of either confirmed progressive disease according to RECIST criteria or death., up to 24 weeks|Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (safety and tolerability), Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (safety and tolerability) will be assessed throughout the treatment period using the NCI CTCAE v4.0 and summarised in tabular format. Reported toxicities will be coded using MedDRA (current version). For each agent,the proportion of patients reporting a dose reduction/delay during trial treatment will be presented, through study completion, estimated average 1 year|Duration of response for each cohort, The duration of response is measured from the time of first documentation of RECIST complete/partial response (whichever status is recorded first) until the first date that recurrence or progressive disease is objectively documented, taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started. Median duration of response and interquartile range will be presented along with its 95% confidence interval., through study completion, estimated average 1 year|Frequency of mutations identified in ctDNA screening, The proportion of patients undergoing ctDNA screening who have each targetable mutation of interest will be presented., Baseline|The proportion of patients with a targetable mutation who enter a therapeutic component, The proportion of patients with a targetable mutation who enter the relevant therapeutic cohort will also be presented., Baseline|Agreement between ctDNA mutation status and tissue mutation status for patients entering the therapeutic component, The proportion of cancers with a ctDNA detected mutation that have a matching mutation on subsequent tissue biopsy will be presented with associated exact two-sided 95% confidence interval., Baseline|Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Changes in Maximum Plasma Concentration during the treatment period for Cohorts A and B will be displayed graphically per patient. Values at specific time points will be summarised across all patients using the mean, standard deviation and range. Analyses will be performed separately for patients in Cohorts A and B., Monthly up to 4 months|Area Under the Curve (AUC), Changes in area under the plasma concentration vs time curve during the treatment period for Cohorts A and B will be displayed graphically per patient. Values at specific time points will be summarised across all patients using the mean, standard deviation and range. Analyses will be performed separately for patients in Cohorts A and B., Monthly up to 4 months
