PET/CT Imaging of Angiogenesis in Lung or Head and Neck Cancers Prior or During Chemotherapy With Antiangiogenic Agents
The primary objective of this Phase II study is to evaluate the use of labelled RGD ligand in PET/CT to predict and/or to early assess the efficacy of chemotherapy including an agent with antiangiogenic effect.

The predictive value of this approach will be determined by independent assessors on basis of data at the end of the treatment: RECIST 1.1 criteria for CT or MRI, PERCIST criteria for FDG PET/CT, clinical, endoscopic and histological findings.
Advanced Head and Neck Carcinoma|Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Carcinoma
DRUG: radiopharmaceutical (Flotegatide (18F) or RGD (68Ga)
Response to treatment based on RECIST criterion, The value of pretherapeutic and interim RGD PET/CT (Pretherapeutic: D -14 to -1 before the initiation of chemotherapy with antiangiogenic agent. Interim : 21 to 1 day before the third cycle of chemotherapy with antiangiogenic agent) to early predict the therapeutic response of head and neck cancer or non-small cell lung cancer to chemotherapy with antiangiogenic agent. Final therapeutic response will be assessed at the end of the treatment, up to 24 weeks after first examination, according to criteria RECIST 1.1.

Potential risk for the patient: two intravenous administrations of investigational product (Pretherapeutic : D -14 to -1 before the initiation of chemotherapy with antiangiogenic agent. Interim : 21 to 1 day before the third cycle of chemotherapy with antiangiogenic agent) each of them followed by PET/CT acquisition, Pretherapeutic Day-14, Interim Day21
Prospective, multicentre, open label, phase II clinical trial with diagnostic radiopharmaceutical on efficacy and tolerability of 18F or 68Ga labelled RGD peptide for detection of malignant tissues expressing integrins, to predict the therapeutic response of lesions of advanced head and neck cancer or advanced non-small cells lung cancer to treatment including an agent with antiangiogenic effect.
