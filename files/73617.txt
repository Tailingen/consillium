Dose Escalation by Boosting Radiation Dose Within the Primary Tumor Using 18FDG-PET/CT for Unresectable Thoracic Esophageal Cancer
Most local failures after definitive chemoradiation for unresectable esophageal cancer occur in the gross tumor volume (GTV). And the metabolic active areas post-treatment were located in the high FDG uptake areas prior to the radiotherapy. The hypothesis is that selective dose boost to the esophageal GTV could be safely delivered using a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) technique, and that boosting the high 18F-deoxyglucose (FDG) uptake areas of the esophageal GTV defined prior to treatment may improve local tumor control.
