Study of Low-Intensity Conditioning for Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplant
The purpose of this study is to determine whether a reduced intensity conditioning regimen for stem cell transplant with donor cells will allow the donor cells to be effective without causing health problems.
Multiple Myeloma|Lymphocytic Leukemia, Chronic|Lymphoma, Low-Grade
PROCEDURE: Reduced intensity conditioning|PROCEDURE: Rapid immunosuppressive taper|PROCEDURE: Prophylactic donor leukocyte infusions
Percentage of Participants With Acute Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD) Grades 2-4, The primary objective of this study was to establish the rate of acute GVHD following prophylactic cellular immunotherapy after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell therapy using low intensity conditioning for high-risk hematological malignancies. Glucksberg staging was used for organ grading of GVHD. Clinical GVHD was assessed as follows:

Grade 0: No stage 1-4 of any organ Grade 1: Stage 1-2 rash and no liver or gut involvement Grade 2: Stage 3 rash, or Stage 1 liver involvement, or Stage 1 GI Grade 3: Stage 0-3 skin with Stage 2-3 liver, or Stage 2-4 GI Grade 4: Stage 4 skin rash, or Stage 4 liver involvement, 100 days|Percentage of Participants With Progression Free Survival, The second primary objective was to determine the percentage of participants with progression free survival following prophylactic cellular immunotherapy after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell therapy using low intensity conditioning for high-risk hematological malignancies.

We define disease progression as disease recurrence within 180 days of transplant., two years
Percentage of Patients Alive at 2 Years, To estimate the overall survival of patients progression following prophylactic cellular immunotherapy after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell therapy using low intensity conditioning for high-risk hematological malignancies., 2 Years
In this research study patients will receive dosages of chemotherapy that are lower than the usual dosages. The study will determine whether a shorter duration of immunosuppression will permit the donor cells to be effective against the cancer without causing more severe GVHD (Graft Versus Host Disease). Also to be determined is whether the patient's cancer can be prevented from relapsing after blood stem cell transplant by using prophylactic treatment, giving a donor leukocyte infusion BEFORE a relapse happens.

In this research study samples of blood and bone marrow will be analyzed. These samples will be examined to study the cellular production of inflammatory cytokine levels in attempt to be able to predict which patients will have complications like GVHD or relapse.
