Evaluation of Immune Responses and Outcomes in Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma Undergoing Radiotherapy
Radiation therapy is a highly effective modality for managing localized solid tumors and has become a fundamental component of treating unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Our previous preclinical investigation revealed that radiotherapy can initiate immunogenic cell death and facilitate the cross-presentation of tumor antigens by antigen-presenting cells, thereby augmenting systemic anti-tumor T cell responses in murine tumor models. However, this immune response subsequent to irradiation has not been comprehensively evaluated in clinical trials involving hepatocellular carcinoma patients. Given that radiotherapy represents a standard therapeutic approach for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, our ongoing phase II non-randomized trial aims to prospectively assess immunological responses and dose-volumetric parameters, while identifying predictors of clinical outcomes in patients undergoing definitive radiotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma.

Progression free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from signing the informed consent to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause (whichever occurs first) according to RECIST1.1., 12 months
Local control (LC), LC is defined as the time from signing the informed consent to the first occurrence of disease progression in the irradiated field according to RECIST1.1., 12 months|Time to progression (TTP), TTP is defined as the time from signing the informed consent to the first occurrence of disease progression according to RECIST1.1., 12 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as a complete or partial response according to RECIST1.1., 12 months|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from signing the informed consent to death from any cause., 12 months|Incidence and severity of adverse events, Adverse events will be graded using CTCAE v5, 12 months
