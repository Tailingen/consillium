Open-Label Study of Parsaclisib, in Japanese Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Follicular Lymphoma (CITADEL-213)
The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of parsaclisib in Japanese participants with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma
Lymphoma
DRUG: parsaclisib
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as defined by revised response criteria for lymphoma, as determined by an Independent Review Committee (IRC). CR: target nodes/nodal masses regressed to ≤1.5 centimeters (cm) in the longest transverse diameter (LDi); no nonmeasured lesions; regression to normal for organ enlargement; no new lesions; and normal bone marrow by morphology and negative immunohistochemistry if indeterminate. PR: ≥50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to 6 target measurable nodes and extranodal sites; absent/regressed nonmeasured lesions (but no increase); spleen regressed by \>50% in length beyond normal; and no new lesions., up to approximately 3 years
Complete Response Rate (CRR), CRR was defined as the percentage of participants with a CR as defined by revised response criteria for lymphoma, as determined by an IRC. CR was defined as: target nodes/nodal masses regressed to ≤1.5 cm in the LDi; no nonmeasured lesions; regression to normal for organ enlargement; no new lesions; and normal bone marrow by morphology and negative immunohistochemistry if indeterminate., up to approximately 3 years|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR was defined as the time from the first documented evidence of CR or PR until disease progression or death from any cause among participants who achieved an objective response, as determined by radiographic disease assessment provided by an IRC. Progressive disease was defined as ≥1 of the following: abnormal individual node/lesion meeting specific criteria; new/recurrent splenomegaly; new/clear progression of pre-existing nonmeasured lesions; regrowth of any previously resolved lesions; new node \>1.5 cm in any axis; new extranodal site \>1.0 cm in any axis; assessable disease of any size attributable to lymphoma; new/recurrent involvement of bone marrow., up to 20.0 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from the date of the first dose of study treatment until the earliest date of disease progression, as determined by radiographic disease assessment provided by an IRC, or death from any cause. Progressive disease was defined as any new lesion or increase by ≥ 50% of previously involved sites from nadir., up to approximately 3 years|Overall Survival, Overall survival was defined as the time from the date of the first dose of study treatment until death from any cause., up to approximately 3 years|Best Percentage Change in Target Lesion Size From Baseline, as Determined by Independent Review Committee and the Investigator, Target lesion size was measured by the sum of the products of the diameters of all target lesion sizes. The best percent change from Baseline was defined as the largest decrease, or smallest increase if no decrease, from Baseline in target lesion sizes on/before new anti-lymphoma therapy during the study. Percentage change was calculated as (\[the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value\] / the Baseline value) x 100., up to approximately 3 years|Number of Participants With Any Treatment-emergent Adverse Event (TEAE), An adverse event was defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug-related. An AE could therefore have been any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of study treatment. A TEAE was defined as any AE either reported for the first time or the worsening of a pre-existing event after the first dose of study drug and within 30 days of the last administration of study drug., up to 1041 days|Number of Participants With Any Grade 3 or Higher TEAE, An adverse event was as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug-related. A TEAE was defined as any AE either reported for the first time or the worsening of a pre-existing event after the first dose of study drug and within 30 days of the last administration of study drug. The severity of AEs was assessed using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0. Grade 1: mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; treatment not indicated. Grade 2: moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive treatment indicated; limiting age appropriate activities of daily living. Grade 3: severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-care activities of daily living. Grade 4: life-threatening consequences; urgent treatment indicated. Grade 5: fatal., up to 1041 days
