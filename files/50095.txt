Reducing the time between the onset of the first symptoms of cancer and the first consultation with a doctor (patient delay) is essential to improve the vital prognosis and quality of life of patients. Recent data suggest that some sociocognitive and emotional determinants may explain patient delay from a complementary point of view. The main objective of this study is to assess whether, in oeso-gastric cancer, patient delay is linked to these sociocognitive and emotional factors, in addition to previously known factors.

We intend to include in this study 300 patients with a not yet treated oeso-gastric cancer diagnosed in one of 10 health centres in the North of France region. The collected data will be analysed to underline the differences between patients who consulted a doctor earlier versus those who consulted later with a cut off at 8 weeks.
