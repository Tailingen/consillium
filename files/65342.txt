Health Care Coach Support in Reducing Acute Care Use and Cost in Patients With Cancer
This randomized pilot clinical trial studies health care coach support in reducing acute care use and cost in patients with cancer. Health care coach support may help cancer patients to make decisions about their care that matches what is important to them with symptom management.

Change in Patient Satisfaction With Care and Decision Making Among Patients Undergoing Health Care Coach Support as Assessed by Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems-G and Patient Satisfaction With Decision Scale, Each patient will receive a satisfaction with decision-making survey (The Satisfaction with Decision Survey) at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months.

Satisfaction with Decision was assessed using the Satisfaction with Decision scale, which measured rating of decision-making. Questions were assessed with responses on a scale of "strongly disagree," "disagree," "neither agree nor disagree," "agree," or "strongly agree." Results are expressed as proportion of participants who responded "strongly agree.", Change in patient satisfaction with care and decision making from baseline to 6 and 12 months|Change in Patient Satisfaction With Care Among Patients Undergoing Health Care Coach Support as Assessed by Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems-G., Each patient will receive a satisfaction with care survey (The Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems-G) at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months.

Overall Health and Overall Mental or Emotional health was assessed using the Consumer Assessment of Health Care Providers and Systems-Clinician and Group Survey version 2.0 (cite) questions #26, which measured rating of overall health with responses, "excellent," "very good," "fair," or "poor." Questions were assessed with responses "never", "sometimes," "usually," or "always," or care rated as "worst," "fair," good", or "best."

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To reduce acute care utilization by 2-5% for advanced cancer patients by training and deploying health care coaches who help patients and families discuss care goals, virtual modalities, engage in shared-decision-making, and participate in educational activities.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To improve patients' experience of their care. II. Improve patient understanding of advanced care planning. III. To improve the receipt of goal concordant care. IV. To reduce total healthcare costs.

OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

ARM A: Patients receive usual care.

ARM B: Patients undergo health care coach support with a baseline introduction (either telephonic or in-person) of the program followed by a visit (telephonic or in-person) with the health care coach after the first oncology appointment to discuss goals of care. The health care coach will contact patient based on patients' ongoing needs (weekly to monthly) and will conduct symptom assessments based on patients' treatment plans and symptoms.

After completion of study, patients are followed up for 6 months.
