BiRd vs. Rd as Initial Therapy in Multiple Myeloma
This is a randomized, open-label, phase III study to investigate the efficacy of combination therapy with an induction phase utilizing a combination clarithromycin (Biaxin®), lenalidomide (Revlimid®), dexamethasone (Decadron®), in multiple myeloma patients who are newly diagnosed and require treatment when compared to patients who receive lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone.

DRUG: Clarithromycin|DRUG: Lenalidomide|DRUG: Dexamethasone
Survival Duration Without Disease Progression, Calculate rate of progression-free survival for subjects following treatment BiRd regimen compared to Rd treatment regimen. Progression is determined by the International Myeloma Working Group Criteria., Until disease progression or death from any cause, for a maximum of approximately 5 years
Overall Response Rate, Capture the number of subjects who demonstrate a complete or partial response to treatment with BiRD regimen, as compared to Rd. Complete and partial responses are defined by the International Myeloma Working Group Criteria., 2 years|Number of Adverse Events Experienced, Capture the number of adverse events experienced with BiRd regimen as compared to Rd regimen, 2 years|Overall Survival, Survival following treatment to the date of death of subjects on BiRd regimen as compared to Rd., 4 years|Number of Days After Initiating Treatment With BiRd Regimen to Disease Progression, as Compared to Subjects on Rd Treatment Regimen., Progression is determined by the International Myeloma Working Group Criteria., Until disease progression for a maximum of approximately 5 years|Number of Patients With Objective Response Rate (CR+PR), up to 3 years|Number of Patients With Complete Response Rate (CR), Complete response is defined by the International Myeloma Working Group Criteria., up to 3 years|Number of Days for Event-Free Survival, Descriptively presented for each treatment group and no formal statistical comparison will be made between treatment arms, approximately 5 years|Number of Days for Duration of Response, Descriptively presented for each treatment group and no formal statistical comparison will be made between treatment arms, up to 3 years|Number of Months to Progression-Free Survival 2, Time from study entry until 2nd instance of disease progression. Progression is determined by the International Myeloma Working Group Criteria. Descriptively presented for each treatment group and no formal statistical comparison will be made between treatment arms., approximately 5 years|Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Fatigue Subscale (FS; Version 4) Score of Patients Receiving BiRd vs Rd Treatment, The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Fatigue (FACIT-F) is a 40-item measure that assesses self-reported fatigue and its impact upon daily activities and function. The FACIT- Fatigue Subscore (FS) is comprised of 13 items, within the total 40-item FACIT-F, that assess fatigue and its impact. This analysis is only based on the FS score. Items are scored on a 5 point Likert-type scale. Item scores can range from 0 ("not at all") to 4 ("very much"), and the total, summed score from 0 to 52; lower scores indicate greater fatigue. The recall period for each item is the past 7 days. Data is descriptively presented for each treatment group and no formal statistical comparison will be made between treatment arms., up to 3 years
This research study is for men and women with newly diagnosed, previously untreated multiple myeloma. The purpose of this study is to observe the how well the different combinations of study drugs work as therapy for patients with newly diagnosed, transplant ineligible, previously untreated multiple myeloma.

The study will be done in two arms:

BiRd Arm:

* Clarithromycin 500mg PO twice daily on days 1-28 for a 28-day cycle
* Lenalidomide 25mg PO daily on days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle
* Dexamethasone 40mg PO will be given on days 1, 8, 15, 22 of a 28-day cycle

Rd Arm:

* Lenalidomide 25mg PO daily on days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle
* Dexamethasone 40mg PO will be given on days 1, 8, 15, 22 of a 28-day cycle

Subjects will be treated in 28-day cycles and may continue treatment as long as they are responding to therapy and not experiencing unacceptable side effects or disease progression. There will be an evaluation at the end of each cycle. Participants will be in the study until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
