Is Bronchoscopy Necessary in the Preoperative Workup of GGO Lung Cancer?(ECTOP-1005)
This study is one of Eastern Cooperative Thoracic Oncology Projects (ECTOP-1005). It aims to evaluate the role of flexible bronchoscopy in the pre-operative workup of ground glass opacity featured lung cancer. All enrolled patients receive the flexible bronchoscopy examination before surgery. Investigators observe the intra-bronchial findings of bronchoscopy and the impact of these findings on established surgical plan.

The appropriateness of routine use of bronchoscopy in the operative workup of a solitary pulmonary nodule（SPN） is debatable. Options expressed in the literature vary from routine preoperative bronchoscopy having no role in obtaining tissue diagnosis in small SPNs to it begin very useful in determining underlying etiology and surgical strategy. The American College of Chest Physicians（ACCP）guidelines recommend bronchoscopy only if air-bronchogram is present or if operator has expertise with newer guided techniques. Previous study showed that bronchoscopy is not indicated in SPNs that present with ground-glass opacity on CT. The purpose of this analysis is to define that role by examining in GGO patients （1）intra-bronchial findings （2）impact of these findings on established surgical plan.
