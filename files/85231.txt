Pilot Study of Memory-like Natural Killer (ML NK) Cells After TCRαβ T Cell Depleted Haploidentical Transplant in AML
This phase I/II pilot study aims to enhance the effectiveness of stem cell transplant for children and young adults with high-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Patients will undergo a stem cell transplant from a half-matched family donor. One week later, patients will receive an additional infusion of immune cells and a drug called interleukin-2.

To mitigate the potential complications associated with graft-versus-host-disease, the donated stem cell product undergoes a process that removes a specific type of immune cell. After transplant, recipients are administered additional immune cells known as memory-like natural killer (ML NK) cells. These cells are derived by converting conventional natural killer cells obtained from the donor.

The infusion of a modified stem cell product, along with administration of ML NK cells may help prevent the development of GvHD while simultaneously improving the efficacy of the treatment.

Safety of patients being administered donor-derived ML NK cells following TCR alpha beta depleted haploidentical cell transplant, Safety will be determined by events occurring following transplant. Non-relapse mortality, engraftment failure, and development of severe GvHD will be considered events., From transplant through Day +100|Feasibility of manufacturing and administering donor-derived ML NK cells following TCR alpha beta depleted haploidentical cell transplant, Feasibility is defined by product manufacture failure, i.e., the inability to infuse ML NK cells due to product contamination or insufficient cell dose (\<0.5x10\^6 / kg recipient weight)., Through time of ML NK cell infusion (around Day +7)
Relapse Free Survival (RFS), Defined as the time between the date of transplant and date of last follow up, relapse, or death due to any cause., From transplant through Month 12|Overall Survival (OS), Defined as death from any cause following transplant., From transplant through Month 12|Development of acute graft versus host disease (aGvHD), Incidence of grade II, III, or IV acute GvHD as graded according to the NIH consensus criteria. Severe aGvHD (Grades III-IV) is considered an event., From transplant through Day +100|Development of chronic graft versus host disease (cGvHD), Incidence of chronic GvHD as graded according to the NIH consensus criteria. Severe cGvHD is considered an event., From transplant through Day +180|Development of chronic graft versus host disease (cGvHD), Incidence and severity of chronic GvHD as graded according to the NIH consensus criteria. Severe cGvHD is considered an event., From transplant through Day +365|Development of infections, Significant infections include, but are not limited to, bacterial or fungal sepsis, viral reactivation with or without clinical disease, other viral infections, and community acquired infections., From transplant through Day +180|Analysis of immune reconstitution, Immune reconstitution is defined as regain of function of donor-derived immunogenic cells and is measured by recovery of individual cellular compartments., From transplant through Month 24
