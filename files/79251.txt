Number of Participants With Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), DLT was defined as Adverse Events(AEs) with any of following toxicities: Grade 4 nonhematologic toxicity or hematologic toxicity lasting more than equal to(\>=) 7 days despite medical intervention; Grade 3 nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea lasting \>= 3 days despite supportive care; Any Grade 3 or Grade 4 nonhematologic lab value leading to hospitalization or persisting for \>= 7 days; Grade 3 or Grade 4: grade 3 is defined as absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than (\<) 1,000/Cubic Millimeter(mm3) with a temperature of \> 38.3 degree Celsius (°C); grade 4 is defined as ANC \< 1,000/mm3 with a temperature of \> 38.3°C, with life-threatening consequences; Thrombocytopenia \< 25,000/mm3 associated with bleeding not resulting in hemodynamic instability or a life-threatening bleeding resulting in urgent intervention; Bleeding events \>= Grade 3 occurring within 5 days of bintrafusp alfa treatment; Prolonged delay(\> 3 weeks) in initiating Cycle 2 due to treatment-related toxicity; Grade 5 toxicity., Day 1 Week 1 up to Week 3|Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Serious TEAEs, An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which did not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Serious AE was defined AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial/prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect. TEAE was defined as events with onset date or worsening during the on-treatment period. TEAEs included serious TEAEs and non-serious TEAEs., Time from first treatment assessed up to approximately 26 months
Percentage of Participants With Confirmed Objective Response According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) as Assessed by Investigator (IRC), Percentage of participants with confirmed objective response that is at least one overall assessment of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) reported here. CR: Disappearance of all evidence of target and non-target lesions. PR: At least 30% reduction from baseline in the sum of the longest diameter (SLD) of all lesions. Confirmed CR = at least 2 determinations of CR at least 4 weeks apart and before progression. Confirmed PR = at least 2 determinations of PR at least 4 weeks apart and before progression (and not qualifying for a CR). Confirmed objective response was determined according to RECIST v1.1 and as adjudicated by Investigator., Time from first treatment assessed up to approximately 26 months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST Version 1.1) Assessed by Investigator, PFS was defined as the time from first administration of study intervention until date of the first documentation of disease progression (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. PD: At least a 20 percent (%) increase in the SLD, taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded from baseline or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions. Kaplan-Meier estimates was used to calculate PFS., Time from first administration of study drug until the first documentation of PD or death, assessed up to approximately 26 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from first administration of study intervention to the date of death due to any cause. The OS was analyzed by using the Kaplan-Meier method., Time from first treatment assessed up to approximately 26 months|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR was defined for participants with confirmed response, as the time from first documentation of confirmed objective response (Complete Response \[CR\] or Partial Response \[PR\]) according to RECIST 1.1 to the date of first documentation of progression disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. CR: Disappearance of all evidence of target and non-target lesions. PR: At least 30% reduction from baseline in the SLD of all lesions. PD: At least a 20 percent (%) increase in the SLD, taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded from baseline or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions. Results were calculated based on Kaplan-Meier estimates., Time from first documentation of a confirmed objective response to PD or death due to any cause (assessed up to approximately 26 months)|Immediate Observed Serum Concentration at End of Infusion (Ceoi) of Bintrafusp Alfa, Ceoi was the observed concentration at the end of the infusion period. This was taken directly from the observed Bintrafusp Alfa concentration-time data., Predose, Day 22, Day 43, Day 64 and Day 85|Serum Trough Concentration Levels (Ctrough) of Bintrafusp Alfa, Ctrough was the serum concentration observed immediately before next dosing., Predose, Day 22, Day 43, Day 64 and Day 85|Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve From Time Zero to Last Measurable Concentration (AUC0-t) of Bintrafusp Alfa, The area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from time zero (= dosing time) to the last sampling time (tlast) at which the concentration is at or above the lower limit of quantification. Calculated using the mixed log-linear trapezoidal rule (linear up, log down)., Predose, Day 22, Day 43, Day 64 and Day 85|Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve From Time Zero Extrapolated to Infinity (AUC0-inf) of Bintrafusp Alfa, The AUC from time zero (dosing time) extrapolated to infinity, based on the predicted value for the concentration at tlast, as estimated using the linear regression from terminal first order (elimination) rate constant determination. AUC0-inf= AUC0-tlast +Clast pred/ terminal first order (elimination) rate constant., Predose, Day 22, Day 43, Day 64 and Day 85|Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of Bintrafusp Alfa, Cmax was obtained directly from the concentration versus time curve., Predose, Day 22, Day 43, Day 64 and Day 85|Time to Reach Maximum Plasma Concentration (Tmax) of Bintrafusp Alfa, The time to reach the maximum observed concentration collected during a dosing interval. Tmax was obtained directly from the concentration versus time curve., Predose, Day 22, Day 43, Day 64 and Day 85|Terminal Elimination Half-Life (T1/2) of Bintrafusp Alfa, Elimination half-life determined as 0.693/terminal first order (elimination) rate constant., Predose, Day 22, Day 43, Day 64 and Day 85|Number of Participants With Positive Antidrug Antibodies (ADA), Serum samples were analyzed by a validated assay method to detect the presence of antidrug antibodies (ADA). Number of participants with positive ADA were reported., Time from first treatment assessed up to approximately 26 months
