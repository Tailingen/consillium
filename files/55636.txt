The Objective is to Respond to Patients' Needs in the Field of Larynx Replacement
Supplement pharyngolaryngeal deficient functions by insertion of a prosthesis with valves in order to allow tracheotomy closing (when applicable) and / or to allow restoration of god swallowing capacity. The secondary objective is to study the concept of a special valves system for the development of an artificial larynx
