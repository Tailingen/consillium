A Prospective Registry Study of Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR) for Oligometastatic/Oligometastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma
Study the efficacy and toxicity of SABR treatment for oligometastatic/oligoprogressive renal cell carcinoma; investigate the effectiveness and safety of SABR combined with targeted immunotherapy; conduct stratified analysis to identify the optimal beneficiary population; establish a biobank to screen for biomarkers; and use radiomics analysis to identify characteristics of sensitive populations.

This study is a non-randomized, prospective, registry-based trial that aims to enroll 60 patients with renal cancer who will be diagnosed and treated at our hospital between May 2024 and May 2026. Without altering the patients' systemic treatment plans, those who meet the inclusion criteria after MDT discussion will receive SBRT (Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy) for all lesions/all metastatic lesions in addition to the guideline-recommended medications. The radiotherapy plan is based on the SABR-COMET protocol and Timmerman's constraints. Patient data will be collected, including general clinical information, toxicity assessments during treatment and in the acute phase, detailed imaging data, regular assessments of pain and quality of life, and evaluations of late radiation therapy responses.
