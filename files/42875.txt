Study of ST-1898 in Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma
ST-1898 is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor for multi-targets, especially for VEGFR2, c-MET, AXL，PDGFRA，RET，KIT etc. This trial is to evaluate its safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic, and efficacy in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

In phase Ib, the primary objectives are to assess the safety and tolerability, and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ST-1898 tablets in patients with advanced RCC. Secondary objectives are to assess the plasma concentration of ST-1898 and to evaluate the efficacy in patients with advanced RCC.

In phase II, the primary objective is to assess the anti-tumor activities of ST-1898 tablets in patients with advanced RCC. The secondary objective is to evaluate the safety of ST-1898 tablets in patients with advanced RCC.
Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: ST-1898 tablets
Phase Ib Dose Escalation：Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), The MTD was defined as the highest dose level at which no more than 1 in 6 participants experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during the first cycle (21days) of treatment., Within the first cycle (21days)|Phase Ib Dose Escalation: The Number and frequency of treatment-related adverse events (AEs) and treatment-related serious adverse events (SAEs), The AEs and SAEs will be assessed according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) CTCAE v5.0., Approximately 18 months|Phase II Expansion: Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as The percentage of participants who experience a CR or PR based on RECIST 1.1 (CR: Complete Response, Disappearance of all target lesions, PR: Partial Response, At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions), Approximately 18 months
Phase Ib Dose Escalation: Plasma PK, To assess plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) of oral administration of ST-1898 in participants with advanced renal cell carcinoma, On Day 1, 8, 21 of Cycle 1 and Day 1 of Cycle 3, approximately 10 weeks|Phase Ib Dose Escalation: ORR, Objective Response Rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1, Approximately 18 months|Phase Ib Dose Escalation: DOR, DOR Duration of Response (DOR) per RECIST 1.1, Approximately 18 months|Phase Ib Dose Escalation: PFS, Progression-Free Survival (PFS) per RECIST 1.1, Approximately 18 months|Phase Ib Dose Escalation: DCR, Disease Control Rate (DCR) per RECIST 1.1, Approximately 18 months|Phase Ib Dose Escalation: OS, Overall Survival (OS), Approximately 30 months|Phase Ib Dose Escalation: TTP, Time to Progression（TTP）per RECIST 1.1, Approximately 18 months|Phase II Dose Expansion: DOR, DOR Duration of Response (DOR) per RECIST 1.1, Approximately 18 months|Phase II Dose Expansion: PFS, Progression-Free Survival (PFS) per RECIST 1.1, Approximately 18 months|Phase II Dose Expansion: DCR, Disease Control Rate (DCR) per RECIST 1.1, Approximately 18 months|Phase II Dose Expansion: OS, Overall Survival (OS) per RECIST 1.1, Approximately 30 months|Phase II Dose Expansion: OS12m, 12-Month survival rate（OS12m）, 12 months|Phase II Dose Expansion: The Number and frequency of treatment-related adverse events and serious adverse events (SAEs), The AEs and SAEs will be assessed according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) CTCAE v5.0., Approximately 18 months
