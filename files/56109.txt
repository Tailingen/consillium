Performance Evaluation of Diagnostic Accuracy of PanTum Detect Test for Detection of Solid Tumours in Known Cancer Population and in Cancer Free Population.
Performance evaluation of diagnostic accuracy (Sensitivity and Specificity) of PanTum detect Test for detection of solid tumours in known cancer population (Sick population) and in cancer free (Healthy) population.
Solid Tumor
Performance evaluation of diagnostic accuracy (Sensitivity and Specificity) of PanTum detect Test for detection of solid tumours in known cancer population (Sick population) and in cancer free (Healthy) population., PanTum Detect is a simple blood test that can detect presence of solid tumors using two important tumor biomarkers - Apo 10 and TKTL-1. Most tumors develop slowly and gradually. From the first tumor cell, to the identification of the tumor itself, there can be a timespan of many years. The turning point where a locally growing tumor develops into an invasive, metastasizing cancer is paramount for curability. It is the objective of PanTum Detect to detect a tumor in time before this critical turning point. Such locally growing tumors can often easily be removed by surgery or treated successfully., 1 YEAR
