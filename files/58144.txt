Duration of Grade 3 or 4 Neutropenia (ANC <1.0×10^9/L) in Cycle 1, Grade 3 defined as ANC \<1.0×10\^9/L and Grade 4 defined as ANC\<0.5×10\^9/L. According to the study protocol, the outcome measure "Duration of Grade 3 or 4 Neutropenia (days)" applied to all participants with a valid ANC level, rather than those with an ANC level of \< 1.0 × 109/L. The value of 0 represents the participant experienced 0 days with Grade 3 or 4 Neutropenia (days). Whereas exclusion of a participant from the analysis indicates a lack of ANC data of the participant.

The mean value was calculated as the sum of the durations (days) of ANC \< 1.0 × 109/L for all participants with valid ANC level (the numerator) divided by the number of participants (the denominator)., Cycle 1, the first of 4, 21-day chemotherapy cycles (average 3 weeks)
