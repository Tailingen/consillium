Study of BGB-290 or Placebo in Participants With Advanced or Inoperable Gastric Cancer
This study enrolled participants with previously-treated advanced or inoperable gastric cancer who have responded to first line platinum therapy into two treatment arms. In Arm A participants received BGB-290; in Arm B participants received placebo. The purpose of this study is to show that BGB-290 (pamiparib) (versus placebo) will improve progression-free survival (PFS) in participants with advanced or inoperable gastric cancer.
Advanced or Inoperable Gastric Cancer
DRUG: Pamiparib|DRUG: Placebo
Progression Free Survival (PFS) by Investigator Assessment, PFS is defined as the time from randomization to progressive disease (PD) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors ( RECIST) Version 1.1 by investigator assessment or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Approximately 23 months
Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause., Approximately 23 months|Time To Second Subsequent Treatment (TSST), TSST is defined as the time from randomization until the second subsequent anticancer therapy or death after next-line therapy, Approximately 23 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of Complete Response or Partial Response per RECIST Version 1.1 by investigator assessment, Approximately 23 months|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the first documented confirmed response of Complete Response or Partial Response to progressive disease (PD) per RECIST Version 1.1 by investigator assessment or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, Approximately 23 months|Time To Response, Time to response is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented response of Complete Response or Partial Response per RECIST Version 1.1 by investigator assessment, Approximately 23 months|Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), From start of study treatment until 30 days after the last study drug intake or initiation of new anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 4 years and 5.5 months)
This is a double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized multicenter global phase 2 study comparing the efficacy and safety of single agent poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor BGB-290 to placebo as maintenance therapy in participants with advanced gastric cancer who have responded to first line platinum based chemotherapy. Participants are randomized 1:1 to BGB-290 (Arm A) or placebo (Arm B). Randomization will be stratified by geography, biomarker status, and ECOG performance status.

Participants will undergo tumor assessments at screening and then every 8 weeks, or as clinically indicated. Administration of BGB-290 or placebo will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, or another discontinuation criterion is met.

After end of treatment, long-term follow-up assessments include tumor imaging every 8 weeks for those participants without disease progression, survival status, and new anticancer therapy.
