Culture System for Isolating Circulating Tumor Cells
This culture system utilizes the special affinity difference of biomedical material coating for different cells to achieve the effect of isolating cancer cells from the blood sample. The coating of the system has the characteristic that to make the WBCs adhesion, but the cancer cells in the blood sample suspend in the culture medium, which achieves the effect of separating cancer cells from the blood. The supernatant with the cancer cells can further be isolated from the cultural system for related analysis and detection to achieve early diagnosis and screening.
Early Detection of Cancer
Cancer Cell Isolation Efficiency of The Isolation System, The percentage isolation of fluorescently-labeled A549 cell lines will be spiked into the whole blood, and the put into the system. The supernatant of the system will be collected to re-culture on the culture dishes and analyzed by fluorescence microscope., 1 day|WBCs adhesion ratio, The whole blood will be diluted and put into the system. And the supernatant will be collected to count the number of blood cell number by the automatic blood cell count., 1 hour
