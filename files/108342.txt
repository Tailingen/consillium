The PancreasGroup.org team is conducting a "snapshot" clinical study investigating the outcomes of pancreatic surgery worldwide. This "collaborative" model for snapshot clinical studies is a well-established approach for assessing current practice in a short period of time.

There will be 3 months of prospective enrolment and 3 months follow up within a 12-month frame. The study will provide highly valuable data on outcomes after pancreatic surgery.

The investigators are aiming at providing a verified record of true morbidity and mortality in consecutive unselected patients. This way the investigators will help identify relevant, modifiable predicting factors for outcome after pancreatic surgery.
