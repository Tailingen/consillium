Study of a Multi-Antigen Therapeutic Vaccine in Patients With Metastatic Melanoma
Primary objective:

To evaluate the clinical activity of the vaccine regimen, as indicated by progression-free survival versus the clinical activity of the reference treatment.

Secondary objectives:

Safety: To describe the safety profile in both treatment groups.

Efficacy: To determine the objective clinical responses of patients in both treatment groups: complete response and partial response.

BIOLOGICAL: ALVAC(2) Melanoma multi-antigen therapeutic vaccine|BIOLOGICAL: Intron A, Interferon alpha -2b
Summary of Disease Progression in Study Participants, Intent-to-treat Population, Number of evaluable study participants who had died or experienced objective disease progression (no clinical objective response to treatment as evaluated by computed tomography \[CT\] scans or physical examination)., Day 0 up to 35 weeks post 1st vaccination or treatment|Progression-Free Survival Time by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) Criteria in the Intent-to-treat Population, Progression-Free Survival was assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor criteria from the computed tomography (CT) scans, as per-protocol, Day 0 - up to 35 weeks post 1st vaccination or treatment
Best Overall Objective Response as Number of Participants Responding in the Intent-to-treat Population, Objective response rate (ORR) is the sum of complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) Complete response = Disappearance of all target lesions. Partial response = At least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter., Day 0 to 32 weeks post 1st vaccination or treatment|Best Overall Objective Response in the Intent-to-treat Population, Objective response rate (ORR) is the sum of complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) Complete response = Disappearance of all target lesions. Partial response = At least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter., Day 0 to 32 weeks post 1st vaccination or treatment|Best Overall Objective Response as Mean Duration of Response (Weeks) in the Intent-to-treat Population, Objective response rate (ORR) is the sum of complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) Complete response = Disappearance of all target lesions. Partial response = At least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter., Day 0 to 32 weeks post 1st vaccination or treatment|Number of Participants Reporting a Grade 3 or Grade 4 Adverse Events by Preferred Term, Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) definitions:

Grade 3 is a severe adverse event; Grade 4 is a life-threatening or disabling adverse event., Day 0 to 12 months post last vaccination
Number of Participants With a Vaccine-Induced Increase of CD8 T-Cell Positive Response by Antigen, The vaccine-induced increase of CD8 T-Cell positive response by antigen post-vaccination during the observation period compared to the screening values., Day 0 to 32 weeks post 1st vaccination|Number of Participants With a Vaccine-Induced Increase of CD4 T-Cell Positive Response by Antigen, The Vaccine-induced increase of CD4 T-Cell positive response by antigen post-vaccination during the observation period compared to the screening values., Day 0 to 32 weeks post 1st vaccination|Summary of Cellular Immune Response to the Vaccination or Treatment (Percent Regulatory T-Cells Responses), The immunogenicity of the treatment regimens was assessed by regulatory T-cell responses as assessed primarily by the multi-parametric intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assay., Day 0 to 32 weeks post 1st vaccination or treatment
Eligible participants will be randomized to receive either a vaccine treatment consisting of a series of multi-antigen melanoma vaccine and GM-CSF injections, followed by high-dose IFN-α2b or only the high-dose IFN-α2b.
