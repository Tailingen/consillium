Second Line Chemotherapy for Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
No validated second-line chemotherapy for the treatment of locally advanced/metastatic pancreatic cancer is actually available,after the failure of a gemcitabine(+/- Cisplatin or Oxaliplatin)-based regimen.

Irinotecan seems to be a moderately active drug in the treatment of this disease Recently was reported some interesting results using a potentially non -cross resistant regimen (FOLFIRI) which could be useful even as second-line chemotherapy.

An exploratory study in this setting seem warranted.
Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: FOLFIRI
Overall Response Rate (RECIST Criteria), time from randomization date to date of death from any cause, 2 years
Safety and tolerability; Safety (CTC criteria - version 3.0), Treatment will consist of 4 combination-chemotherapy cycles and in case of stable or responsive disease, other 4 cycles can be administered at investigator's discretion. Therefore will be administered for up to 6 months Each treatment cycle will consist of 2 weeks, unless the start of the subsequent cycle is delayed, in which case the cycle length will be longer than 4 weeks., 18 months|Overall survival (OS), OS is calculated using the Kaplan-Meyer method The principal objective of the trial is to assess the therapeutic activity of FOLFIRI in patients with exocrine pancreas carcinoma.

The primary activity parameter to be determined is overall response rate., time from first cycle to death|Progression Free Survival, PFS was calculated using the Kaplan-Meyer method Presence of at least one target lesion measurable by CT scan or MRI in not an irradiated area (and conform with the RECIST criteria), time from first cycle to progression or death
