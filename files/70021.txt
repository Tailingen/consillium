Mocetinostat (MGCD0103) Plus Brentuximab Vedotin (SGN-35) in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to find out how safe and effective treatment with a new combination of drugs, mocetinostat and brentuximab vedotin, is in treating cancer. There will be 2 parts to this trial: a phase I part and a phase II part.

Brentuximab vedotin is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be given to patients with Hodgkin Lymphoma. Mocetinostat is an experimental drug that has been given to patients with Hodgkin lymphoma in another clinical trial. When given alone, mocetinostat caused lymphoma to shrink in about 1 out of 4 patients with Hodgkin lymphoma. This is the first study that will give mocetinostat and brentuximab vedotin together.
Hodgkin Lymphoma
DRUG: Mocetinostat Plus Brentuximab Vedotin
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), For this objective the standard 3+3 dose-escalation scheme will be used. Patients will be accrued to the study in cohorts of 3 (starting with dose level 1). For any given dose an initial cohort of 3 patients will be treated at that dose. The dose level will be escalated if none of the 3 patients exhibits any DLT, 1 year
Overall Response Rate (ORR), Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., 1 year
