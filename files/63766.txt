B Cell Maturation Antigen（BMCA）-Targeted CAR-T for Refractory/Relapsed Multiple Myeloma
It's a single arm, open label prospective study, in which the safety and efficacy of B Cell Maturation Antigen（BMCA）-targeted CAR-T thearpy are evaluated in refractory/relapsed multiple myeloma patients.
Multiple Myeloma

complete remission rate, complete remission rate after treated by CAR-T therapy, at the time point 3 months after CAR-T cell transfusion|incidence and severity of adverse events, any unfavorable and unintended sign , symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure that may or may not be considered related to the medical treatment or procedure

any unfavorable and unintended sign , symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure that may or may not be considered related to the medical treatment or procedure

any unfavorable and unintended sign , symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure that may or may not be considered related to the medical treatment or procedure, from the date of the start of treatment to 36 months after last patient's enrollment
progression free survival, from date of inclusion to date of progression, relapse, or death from any cause, from the day of treatment to the date of first documented progression，up to 36 months after the last patient's enrollment|overall survival, from the date of inclusion to date of death, irrespective of cause, from the day of treatment to the date of first documented progression，up to 36 months after the last patient's enrollment|duration of the CAR-T cells in the patients, time from re-transfusion to date when the modified T cells become non-detectable, from the date of re-transfusison to 36 months after last patient's enrollment
In this trial, T cells are seperated from multiple myeloma patients, and engineered into BMCA-targeted CAR-T cells, these cells are then transfused back into the patients to elimimnate the myeloma cells. In this process, the safety and efficacy of this CAR-T treatment are closely monitored.
