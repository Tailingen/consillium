TICOP Mobile App and E-platform: Providing Information and Support for Parents Caring for Their Child Cancer Survivor
This study aims to develop a mobile App (named "TICOP") for parents of a childhood cancer survivor and an E-Platform for health professionals which work in pediatric oncology area.

The core objective is to evaluate the effects of these two digital tools (mobile app and platform) in the detection and prevention among parents of a childhood cancer survivor.

Parents of a childhood cancer survivor face ongoing social, and psychological challenges that may result in enduring illness and caregiving related distress and vulnerabilities. It has been described namely: post posttraumatic stress symptoms \[PTSS\], lingering worries, anxiety and depression. While strategies and interventions to minimize the child's distress have become part of comprehensive medical care in paediatrics, it also becomes urgent to develop research into parents of a childhood cancer survivor in order to: \[1\] train the medical staff to identify the serious issue of parental distress ; \[2\] detect other markers of vulnerabilities (e.g. pessimism, anxiety trait) and \[3\] provide them with a personalized psychological intervention. This would allow vigilance of the medical staff in detecting parents' distress and could defuse their descent into a vicious circle of psychosocial difficulties.

Up to now, empirical findings suggest the importance to develop a screening tool for parents of a CCS in order to detect any parent who presents several difficulties and to propose personal intervention. To the investigator's knowledge, there is no tool to detect and prevent psychological distress among parents of a childhood cancer survivor.

The TICOP mobile app consists of seven axis of evaluation and detection for parents of a childhood cancer survivor:

Parent moves the cursor by analogy on their mobile phone (as a visual anagogic scale) four times per year (baseline; month 4; month 8 and month 12).

Axis 1: sociodemographic (e.g. gender, marital status) (14 items) Axis 2: psychosomatic symptoms (insomnia, migraine) (16 items) Axis 3: psychological symptoms (e.g. depression, anxiety) (13 items) Axis 4: parental needs (e.g. social support, information) (9 items) Axis 5: parental resources (e.g. emotional support) (8 items) Axis 6: parental risk factors (e.g. anxiety, intolerant of uncertainty) (5 items) Axis 7: parental protective factors (e.g. optimistic,extraverted) (6 items)

All information will be automatically sent in real time into the E-platform. This digital tool allows to obtain a parental state follow-up for the health professional (e.g. oncologist, psycho-oncologist).
