A Multicenter Clinical Trial of Sputum DNA Testing for Lung Cancer in China
The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of Human Multigene Methylation Detection Kit (Fluorescent PCR Method) for help diagnose lung cancer by comparing with clinical standard method (includes chest CT examination or pathological examination).

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Diagnostic Test: Sputum DNA methylation analysis|PROCEDURE: chest CT or pathological examination
Sensitivity, Sensitivity is the percentage of subjects with lung cancer who are correctly identified by the testing kit., One year|Specificity, Specificity is the percentage of subjects without lung cancer who are correctly excluded by the testing kit., One year|Consistency Rate, Consistency rate is the fraction of both true positive and negative diagnostic test results among all subjects., One year|Kappa Coefficient, Kappa coefficient is the consistency analysis of the extent of agreement between the test results of the testing kit and standard method., One year
In this clinical trial, the testing kit to be evaluated is a Human Multigene Methylation Detection Kit (Fluorescent PCR Method), which is intended to qualitatively detect methylation levels of multiple genes in human sputum specimen in vitro by Fluorescent PCR Method, and the standard method used in clinical diagnosis is chest CT examination or pathological examination.

Subjects will provided sputum specimen as required for the evaluation of the testing kit followed by a chest CT examination or pathological examination. Technical personnel who conduct the evaluation of the testing kit will remain blinded to the results of the clinical diagnosis by chest CT and/or pathological examination.

The results of the testing kit will be compared with the standard method, and the effectiveness of the Human Multigene Methylation Detection Kit (Fluorescent PCR Method) for lung cancer detection under normal clinical use will be assessed through statistical analysis.
