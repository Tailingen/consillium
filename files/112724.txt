A Clinical Study of CD70-targeted CAR-T in the Treatment of CD70-positive Advanced/Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is a phase I clinical study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of CAR-T in patients with CD70-positive advanced/metastatic solid tumors, and to obtain the maximum tolerated dose of CAR-T and phase II Recommended dose.
Metastatic Tumor|Advanced Solid Tumor|Renal Cell Carcinoma|Ovarian Cancer|Cervix Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: CD70 CAR-T cells|BIOLOGICAL: CD70 CAR-T cells
Incidence of Adverse events after CD70 CAR-T cells infusion [Safety and Tolerability], Therapy-related adverse events were recorded and assessed according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, Version 5.0), 28 days|Obtain the maximum tolerated dose of CD70 CAR-T cells[Safety and Tolerability], Dose-limiting toxicity after cell infusion, 28 days
Disease control rate of CAR-T cell preparations in CD70 positive advanced malignancies [Effectiveness], Disease control rate: including CR, PR and SD, 3 months|Objective response rate (ORR) of CD70 CAR-T treatment in patients with CD70-positive advanced malignancies[Effectiveness], Objective response rate includes：CR、PR, 3 months|Duration of Response (DOR) of CD70 CAR-T treatment in patients with CD70-positive advanced malignancies[Effectiveness], DOR will be assessed from the first assessment of CR/PR/SD to the first assessment of recurrence or progression of the disease or death from any cause, 3 months|AUCS of CD70 CAR-T cells [Cell dynamics], AUCS is defined as the area under the curve in 28 days and 90 days, 3 months|CMAX of CD70 CAR-T cells [Cell dynamics], CMAX is defined as the highest concentration of CD70 CAR-T cells expanded in peripheral blood, 3 months|TMAX of CD70 CAR-T cells[Cell dynamics], TMAX is defined as the time to reach the highest concentration, 3 months|Pharmacodynamics of CD70 CAR-T cells[Cell dynamics], Concentration levels of CAR-T-related serum cytokines such as CRP, IL-6, ferritin at each time point, 3 months
The correlation between CD70 positive rate and safety, assessment the correlation between CD70 positive rate and the incidence of CRA and ICANS, 1 years|Correlation between CD70 positive rate and efficacy, assessment the correlation between CD70 positive rate and the disease control rate，Disease control rate: including CR, PR and SD, 1 years|Overall survival(OS)of CD70 CAR-T treatment in patients with CD70-positive advanced malignancies[Effectiveness], OS will be assessed from the first CD70-CAR-T cell infusion to death from any cause (Assessed by investigators based on IRECIST criteria), 1 years|Progress-free survival(PFS) of CD70 CAR-T treatment in patients with CD70-positive advanced malignancies[Effectiveness], PFS will be assessed from the first CD70-CAR-T cell infusion to death from any cause or the first assessment of progression (Assessed by investigators based on IRECIST criteria), 1 years|Duration of Response (DOR) of CD70 CAR-T treatment in patients with CD70-positive advanced malignancies[Effectiveness], DOR will be assessed from the first assessment of CR/PR/SD to the first assessment of recurrence or progression of the disease or death from any cause (Assessed by investigators based on IRECIST criteria), 1 years
This is a single-center, double-arm, open-label study. The study plans to set up 2 groups,Intravenous infusion group have 3 dose groups, adopting a dose-escalating 3+3 design, and plan to recruit about 9 subjects with CD70-positive advanced/metastatic solid tumors.Intraperitoneal injection group have 3 dose groups, adopting a dose-escalating 3+3 design, and plan to recruit about 9 subjects with CD70-positive advanced/metastatic solid tumors.
