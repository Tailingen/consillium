Non-curative ESDs: Assessing the Rates and Risk Factors for Residual Neoplasia
Short and long outcomes of ESD are well described, particularly in Eastern series. However, the outcome of non-curative ESDs is scarcely reported in the west (particularly among non-gastric or submucosal lesions). Therefore, the aim of this project is to describe the European experience with non-curative ESDs, analysing all the consecutive ESDs performed in several reference centers, assessing the presence of residual lesion in the endoscopic follow-up or in the surgical specimen.
