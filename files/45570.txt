Lymph Node Removal in Treating Women Who Have Stage I or Stage IIA Breast Cancer
RATIONALE: Surgery to remove lymph nodes in the armpit may remove cancer cells that have spread from tumors in the breast.

PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of removing lymph nodes in the armpit in treating women who have stage I or stage IIA breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: axillary lymph node dissection|RADIATION: whole breast irradiation
Overall survival, Up to 10 years|Morbidity, Up to 10 years|Disease-free survival, Up to 10 years
OBJECTIVES:

Primary objectives:

Long term: To assess whether overall survival for patients randomized to Arm 2 (no immediate ALND) is essentially equivalent to (or better than) than that for patients assigned to Arm 1 (completion ALND).

Short term: To quantify and compare the surgical morbidities associated with SLND plus ALND versus SLND alone.

OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. After segmental mastectomy and sentinel lymph node dissection, patients are stratified according to age (50 and under vs over 50), estrogen receptor status (positive vs negative), and tumor size (no greater than 1 cm vs greater than 1 cm but no greater than 2 cm vs greater than 2 cm). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.
