Screening Effect of Dual-energy CT Combined With Nasopharyngeal Endoscopy for Screening Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
All participants will be tested for EBV-related biomarkers, including EBNA1-IgA, VCA-IgA, and BNLF2b total antibody (P85-Ab), and participants with high serologic risk will be selected based on serologic test results, and dual-energy CT will be performed first for high-risk screening subjects, and dual-energy CT will be performed first for the high-risk group to record dual-energy CT examinations of those suspected of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and then endoscopy was performed on the high-risk group to record those suspected of nasopharyngeal carcinoma under endoscopy, and finally biopsies were taken for positive lesion sites indicated by dual-energy CT and suspicious lesion sites found by endoscopy to clarify the diagnosis.
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: participants will undergo dual-energy CT and endoscopy
Sensitivity and specificity of dual-energy CT and endoscopy in the diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, To compare the sensitivity \[actual number of nasopharyngeal cancers in the population considered by dual-energy CT or endoscopy / (actual number of nasopharyngeal cancers in the population considered by dual-energy CT or endoscopy + number of nasopharyngeal cancers in the non-nasopharyngeal cancer population considered by dual-energy CT or endoscopy)\] and specificity \[actual number of non-nasopharyngeal cancers in the population considered by dual-energy CT or endoscopy / ( actual number of non-nasopharyngeal cancers in the population considered by dual-energy CT or endoscopy + number of non-nasopharyngeal cancers in the nasopharyngeal cancer population considered by dual-energy CT or endoscopy)\] of dual-energy CT and endoscopy in the diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and to determine which test is more accurate in detecting nasopharyngeal carcinoma from the population, 6 months|Positive and negative predictive values of dual-energy CT and endoscopy in the diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, To compare the positive predictive value \[actual number of nasopharyngeal cancers in the population considered by dual-energy CT or endoscopy / (actual number of nasopharyngeal cancers in the population considered by dual-energy CT or endoscopy + number of non-nasopharyngeal cancers in the nasopharyngeal cancer population considered by dual-energy CT or endoscopy )\] and negative predictive value \[actual number of non-nasopharyngeal cancers in the population considered by dual-energy CT or endoscopy / (actual number of non-nasopharyngeal cancers in the population considered by dual-energy CT or endoscopy + number of nasopharyngeal cancers in the non-nasopharyngeal cancer population considered by dual-energy CT or endoscopy)\] of dual-energy CT and endoscopy in the diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, 6 months
