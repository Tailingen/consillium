Study of Anlotinib Plus Irinotecan in Patients With Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
To compare the effects and safety of Anlotinib Plus Irinotecan versus Irinotecan in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma(ESCC).
Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Anlotinib Plus Irinotecan|DRUG: Irinotecan
Progress free survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD was defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also have demonstrated an absolute increase of ≥5 mm., up to 24 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), The proportion of patients with a best overall response of confirmed complete or partial response, or stable disease (CR

+ PR + SD), up to 24 months
Overall Survival (OS), The time from treatment initiation until death from any reason, up to 24 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), The proportion of patients with a confirmed complete response or partial response on two consecutive occasions≥4 weeks apart, as determined by the investigator according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, up to 24 months|Quality of life score, Each 42 days up to intolerance the toxicity or PD, up to 24 months|Number of Participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, Until initiation of new anticancer treatment, up to 24 months|NGS(Next Generation Sequencing) detecting, The sample for NGS detecting can be gotten form storage tumor tissue specimens. It must be better collecting the new tumor tissue specimens after tumor progress, up to 12 months
In recent years, anti-angiogenic therapy has made some progress in the treatment of advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.In clinical use, the efficacy of antiangiogenic monotherapy was low, with a median progression-free survival (PFS) of only 3 to 4 months.We conducted a randomized, open clinical Trial to evaluate efficacy and safety of anlotinib hydrochloride combined with irinotecan versus irinotecan monotherapy in patients with advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
