High-resolution Intra-operative PSMA PET-CT in Prostate Cancer
This is a Single-center, diagnostic open-label prospective, pilot study in a total of 10 patients affected by Prostate cancer (PCa) with a risk of lymph node invasion (LNI) higher than 5% and candidates for a robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) with an extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND) .

The aim of the trial is to evaluate the feasibility and accuracy and clinical value of a novel high-resolution perioperative PET-CT-scan for intraoperative margin and lymph node invasion assessment, after 18F-PSMA injection, using histopathology as the gold standard.
