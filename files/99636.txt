Effects of Different I:E Ratio on Intrapulmonary Shunt Fraction and Oxygenation During One Lung Ventilation in the Lateral Decubitus Position
The purpose of this study is to investigate effect of increasing inspiratory time (I:E ratio 1:1) on intrapulmonary shunt fraction and oxygenation during one lung ventilation in the lateral decubitus position.
Lung Cancer|Lung Lobectomy
PROCEDURE: I:E ratio
intrapulmonary shunt fraction, T1,T2,T3,T4 : ALL mesurement in lateral decubitus position T1-intrapulmonary shunt T2-intrapulmonary shunt T3-intrapulmonary shunt T4-intrapulmonary shunt, T1 (10min before one lung ventibation)T2 (30min after one lung ventilation started)T3 (60min after one lung ventilation started)T4 (10min after two lung ventilation)
Respiratory dynamic parameters, Mechanical Ventilator measurement : Paw, Pplat, Pmean, Compliance, T1,T2,T3,T4 (same as primary outcome measure)
Increasing inspiratory time(e.g. Inverse ratio ventilation) has been known that had advantage of alveolar recruitment, preventing of ateletasis. On the contrary, it has disadvantange of intrinsic PEEP, air trapping. There is few study on one lung ventilation in lateral decubitus position about this ventilation method. We were going to investigate effecf of this ventilation method.
