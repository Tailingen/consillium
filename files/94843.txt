Facts and Attitudes About Clinical Trials
The primary objective of this project is to examine the impact of providing cancer patients with audiovisual information about clinical trials on attitudes towards clinical trial participation. It is hypothesized that patients provided these materials will have more favorable attitudes toward clinical trial participation compared to patients not provided these materials.

Participants will be randomized to either: (1) an intervention condition in which they will be asked to view a short video and read an accompanying brochure about clinical trials developed by the investigative team; or (2) a control condition in which they will be asked to read the National Cancer Institute's brochure entitled "Taking Part in Cancer Treatment Research Studies." Self-report data will be collected at two timepoints: 1) in person following study enrollment, but before receipt of material related to intervention assignment (baseline/Time 1), and 2) by telephone interview between 7 and 28 days following study enrollment (follow-up/Time 2). In addition, data will also be collected from medical records six weeks after study enrollment.

Change from baseline to follow-up in attitudes towards clinical trial participation, The primary objective of this project is to examine the impact of providing cancer patients with audiovisual information about clinical trials on attitudes towards clinical trial participation. It is hypothesized that patients provided these materials will have more favorable attitudes toward clinical trial participation compared to patients not provided these materials., Baseline (before first med onc visit; after first med onc visit; or before second med onc visit) and Follow-up (7-28 days after baseline)
Impact of information on knowledge, self-efficacy, receptivity, and likelihood of participating, The secondary objectives are to examine the impact of audiovisual information about clinical trials on knowledge, self-efficacy, receptivity, and likelihood of participating in a clinical trial. It is hypothesized that patients provided audiovisual materials will be more knowledgeable about clinical trials, will believe themselves to be more capable of participating in a clinical trial, will be more receptive to learning more about a clinical trial, and will report greater likelihood of participating in a clinical trial if asked compared to patients not provided these materials., Baseline (before first med onc visit; after first med onc visit; or before second med onc visit) and Follow-up (7-28 days after baseline)|Impact of information on participation in clinical trials, The tertiary objective is to explore the impact of providing cancer patients with audiovisual information about clinical trials on actual participation in clinical trials. Since this aim is exploratory, no hypothesis is offered., Medical record review (6 weeks after completion of baseline survey)
