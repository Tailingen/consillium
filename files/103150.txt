Initial Feasibility Study to Treat Resectable Pancreatic Cancer With a Planar LDR Source
This is a Phase I evaluation to determine the usefulness of a new brachytherapy device that utilizes active components (Palladium-103) of standard devices in a novel configuration. This study may benefit resectable pancreatic cancer patients by reducing the radiation dose to adjacent critical structures, while giving a therapeutic dose to diseased tissue, such as at a surgical margin.
