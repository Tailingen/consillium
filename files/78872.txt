A Study to Characterize the Safety, Tolerability, and Preliminary Efficacy of CFT1946 as Monotherapy and Combination Therapy in Subjects With BRAF V600 Mutant Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of CFT1946 as well as to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of CFT1946 as monotherapy (Arm A) and in combination with trametinib (CFT1946 + trametinib; Arm B) or Cetuximab (CFT1946 + cetuximab; Arm C).
