TARC After alloSCT in Hodgkin's Lymphoma
Relapsed and refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) patients may experience long-term survival after allogeneic transplant (alloSCT), but disease recurrence represents the main cause of treatment failure. PET (positron-emission tomography) -positive patients after alloSCT have a dismal outcome. Serum TARC (thymus and activation-regulated chemokine) is produced by Reed-Sternberg cells and may be a marker of disease. Our study was aimed at assessing whether TARC levels after alloSCT were correlated to disease status and whether TARC monitoring could increase the ability to predict relapse.
Hodgkin's Lymphoma Patients Who Underwent an Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation
OTHER: no treatment
Correlation between disease status and serum TARC level, Serum TARC level was measured before alloSCT in Hodgkin's lymphoma patients and after alloSCT. The median time interval after alloSCT was 47 days. PFS was estimated at one year based on TARC value., One year after transplant
The correlation between TARC levels and PET results after alloSCT, We selected TARC values done on the days of PET to assess a cut-off value of TARC that was correlated to a positive or negative PET, Before alloSCT, monthly during the first 6 months after alloSCT and every 2 months until 2 years of follow-up, then at the time of clinical check-up (usually every 6 months)
