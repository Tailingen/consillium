Detecting Minimal Residual Diseases (MRD) and Monitoring Clonal Evolution Using Ultrasensitive Chromosomal Aberrations Detection (UCAD) in Multiple Myeloma
The presence of minimal residual disease (MRD) is an important prognostic factor for multiple myeloma, while copy number variation (CNV) is a widely accepted biomarker used for multiple myeloma (MM). Detecting MRD and monitoring clonal evolution by monitoring CNV using low-pass whole genome sequencing is promising due to its high analytical sensitivity. To evaluate the correlation between MRD detected by flow cytometry and low-pass whole genome sequencing, nearly 200 samples were collected for this study. We applied ultrasensitive chromosomal aberrations detection to detect CNV for each patient. The follow-up samples were then collected and sequencing used the same method.
