Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy Trial II (MSLT-II)
Subjects must be diagnosed with melanoma. All subjects receive sentinel lymphadenectomy. If the subject is sentinel node positive and meets study requirements, the subject is randomized to receive either (1) completion lymphadenectomy (2) observation with nodal ultrasound. Subjects are then followed for 10 years.

PROCEDURE: Completion Lymphadenectomy|PROCEDURE: Monitoring with nodal ultrasound
Melanoma-specific survival. This is defined as the time between the date of a subject's randomization (or date of CLND for those randomized to the CLND arm) and the date of death due to melanoma. Subjects are followed until death or 10yrs., 10 years
