Application of ctDNA in Evaluation of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Efficacy and Exploration of Chemoresistance Mechanisms in Pancreatic Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the value of ctDNA detection in the assessment of response rate to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in pancreatic cancer and to explore the correlation between ctDNA clearance and prognosis at different time points. Meanwhile, whole exome sequencing (WES) and RNA Sequencing (RNA-seq) of samples of responders and non-responders to neoadjuvant chemotherapy before and after treatment are performed to explore the mechanisms of drug resistance and provide guidance for clinical decision making.
Patients With Non-metastatic Pancreatic Cancer|Evaluation of Tumor Resectability Shall be Made in Consensus at Multidisciplinary Meetings, According to NCCN Guideline Version 1.2022 Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: ctDNA detection
Objective response rate (ORR) of neoadjuvant therapy in patients with non-metastatic pancreatic cancer, Pre-treatment ctDNA detection and mutation characterization in blood are used to evaluate objective response rate (ORR) of neoadjuvant therapy in patients with non-metastatic pancreatic cancer., Up to 24 months
Rate of adverse reactions, ctDNA detection is performed to evaluate the rate of adverse reactions to neoadjuvant therapy in patients with non-metastatic pancreatic cancer., One week during therapy and 3 months thereafter up to 24 months.|The correlation between detection of blood ctDNA and mutation characteristics before treatment and the rate of adverse reactions, ctDNA detection is performed to analyze the correlation between detection of blood ctDNA and mutation characteristics before treatment and the rate of adverse reactions., One week during therapy and 3 months thereafter up to 24 months.|The correlation between postoperative ctDNA in blood and clearance of ctDNA after adjuvant therapy and overall survival (OS) in patients with operable pancreatic cancer, Correlation between postoperative ctDNA in blood and clearance of ctDNA after adjuvant therapy and overall survival (OS) in patients with operable pancreatic cancer., One week during therapy and 3 months thereafter up to 48 months.|The recurrence of pancreatic cancer, Blood ctDNA after treatment is used to monitor the recurrence of pancreatic cancer., One week during therapy and 3 months thereafter up to 24 months.|The timeliness and accuracy of ctDNA with CA19-9 and medical imaging in the detection of disease recurrence, Blood ctDNA after treatment is used to compare the timeliness and accuracy of ctDNA with CA19-9 and medical imaging in the detection of disease recurrence., Up to 24 months.|The mechanisms of drug resistance to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, WES and RNA-seq of tissue samples of pancreatic cancer patients before and after treatment are performed to explore the mechanisms of drug resistance to neoadjuvant chemotherapy., One week during therapy and 3 months thereafter up to 24 months.
Pancreatic cancer is highly malignant with poor prognosis, and the overall 5-year survival rate is only about 9%. The value of neoadjuvant therapy in pancreatic cancer has been demonstrated by many studies, and a scientific and accurate evaluation of the efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy is crucial to its implementation and achieving the best outcomes. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis provides a non-invasive way to repeatedly assess the genomic profile of tumor. With improvements in detection techniques providing higher levels of sensitivity, ctDNA analysis is rapidly being accepted as a reliable tool in oncology. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the value of ctDNA detection in the assessment of response rate to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in pancreatic cancer and to explore the correlation between ctDNA clearance and prognosis at different time points. Meanwhile, whole exome sequencing (WES) and RNA Sequencing (RNA-seq) of samples of responders and non-responders to neoadjuvant chemotherapy before and after treatment are performed to explore the mechanisms of drug resistance and provide guidance for clinical decision making.
