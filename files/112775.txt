Correlation Between PSA Levels and F-18 PSMA PET/CT Findings in Prostate Cancer Patient
It is a cross sectional study aimed to correlate between PSA Levels and F-18 PSMA PET/CT Scan findings and to evaluate the impact of PET/CT findings on the patient management
Prostatic Neoplasms
DEVICE: PSMA PET/CT
To correlate between PSA Levels and F-18 PSMA PET/CT Scan findings, correlation between PSA Levels and F-18 PSMA PET/CT findings qualitatively \& quantitively interpreted by 2 nuclear medicine physicians.

the Gleason score and findings of anatomical imaging (CT, MRI, ultrasound), will be obtained and compared/correlated with the PSMA expression/volumetric parameters as maximum standardized uptake value (SUV), baseline
To evaluate the impact of PET/CT findings on the patient management, determine dependency of PSA level in patient management in initial staging or biochemical recurrence, one year
Prostate cancer (PC) is a prevalent malignancy that occurs primarily in old males, it is the third most common with regards of mortality (1,2). prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) known as glutamate carboxypeptidase II, is a transmembrane glycoprotein highly expressed in PC cells. PSMA expression tends to increase with increased pathological Gleason grade and is thought to be upregulated with the emergence of androgen independence (2).

PSMA PET/CT imaging is important for correct primary staging and for the detection of sites of biochemical recurrence.

prostate-specific antigen Liu et al., in 2022 stated that as serum PSA levels increase, the diagnostic accuracy of F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT also improves (3) Bergero et al., in 2022 evaluated the diagnostic correlation between PSA and positivity of F-18 PSMA PET/CT in patients with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer (RPC), reporting it as a very good predictor of positivity in 18F-PSMA PET/CT in patients with RPC (4).

A Meta-Analysis in 2022 found that the detection rate (DR) of the18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT was also improved with increasing serum PSA levels (5) Another Meta-Analysis in 2019 studied the DR of F-18 PSMA PET/CT revealing that DR is related to PSA values with significant lower DR in patients with PSA\<0.5 ng/mL (6)
