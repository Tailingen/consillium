A Study of JNJ-86974680 in Participants With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine a safe and tolerable dose(s) of JNJ-86974680 for further research in combination with cetrelimab and radiation therapy.
Carcinoma, Non-small-Cell Lung
DRUG: JNJ-86974680|DRUG: Cetrelimab|RADIATION: Radiation Therapy
Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) by Severity, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a pharmaceutical (investigational or non-investigational) product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the intervention. Severity will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for adverse events (NCI-CTCAE) version 5.0. Severity scale ranges from Grade 1 (Mild) to Grade 5 (Death). Grade 1= Mild, Grade 2= Moderate, Grade 3= Severe, Grade 4= Life-threatening and Grade 5= Death related to adverse event., Up to 2 years 5 months|Number of Participants with Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), The DLTs are specific adverse events and are defined as any of the following: non-hematologic toxicity and hematological toxicity., Up to 2 years 5 months
Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of JNJ-86974680, Cmax is defined as maximum observed plasma concentration of JNJ-86974680., Up to 2 years 5 months|Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve From Time Zero to Time t (AUC0-t) of JNJ-86974680, (AUC0-t) is defined as area under the plasma concentration of JNJ-86974680 versus time curve from the time of dose administration to time of last quantifiable concentration (0-t)., Up to 2 years 5 months|Part 2: Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who have a best response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) version (v)1.1, maintained for at least 4 weeks., Up to 2 years 5 months|Part 2: Complete Response Rate (CRR), CRR is defined as the proportion of participants with a best response of CR., Up to 2 years 5 months|Part 2: Duration of Response (DOR), DoR is defined as the time from the date of first initial documentation of a response to the date of first documented evidence of progression of disease according to immunotherapy response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (iRECIST) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 2 years 5 months|Part 2: Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve a best of response of PR, CR, or stable disease using RECIST v1.1., Up to 2 years 5 months
The purpose of this study is to determine a safe and tolerable dose(s) of JNJ-86974680 for further research in combination with cetrelimab and radiation therapy.
