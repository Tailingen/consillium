Genotype-Driven Treatment of Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Based on mRNA Expression of ERCC1 & RRM1 as First-line Chemotherapy
This is a prospective phase II trial, in patients with unresectable or metastatic NSCLC using chemotherapy regimens which will be defined according to the mRNA expression of ERCC1 and RRM1 of the tumor cells.
Non-small Cell Lung Carcinoma
DRUG: chemotherapy|DRUG: chemotherapy
overall Response Rate, ORR was assessed by tumor response evaluation according to RECIST 1.1 at every 8 weeks. Tumor assessments will continue about every 8 weeks until disease progression or initiation of subsequent anticancer treatment.

(If PR or CR was first documented, confirmation assessment was done between 4 weeks and 8 weeks), From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 36 months
Progression free survival, up to 4 years|overall survival, up to 4 years|duration of response, up to 4 years|disease control rate, up to 4 years
This is a prospective phase II trial, in patients with unresectable or metastatic NSCLC using chemotherapy regimens which will be defined according to the mRNA expression of ERCC1 and RRM1 of the tumor cells.
