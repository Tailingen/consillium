This will be a prospective, case-only, study to measure the impact of MMprofiler on treatment intention decisions in MM patients.

Eligible patients will have their tumor sample analyzed for the prognostic MMprofiler SKY92, several cytogenetic markers, gene expression markers, and gene expression clusters.

A total of 250 patients will be enrolled from up to 9 US centers. Patients will be followed 5 years after diagnosis.
