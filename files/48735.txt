Everolimus and Letrozole or Hormonal Therapy to Treat Endometrial Cancer
The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the combination of the drugs Everolimus and Letrozole compared to Tamoxifen and Medroxyprogesterone acetate in treating endometrial cancer and to determine the types and severity of side effects caused by treatment with these drug combinations.
Advanced, Persistent, or Recurrent Endometrial Cancer
DRUG: Everolimus|DRUG: Tamoxifen|DRUG: Letrozole|DRUG: Medroxyprogesterone Acetate
Frequency of Response, A confirmed complete or partial response as defined by RECIST 1.1 was considered a response. "Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death , up to 3 years.
Median Progression-free Survival, Progression-free Survival is defined as the duration alive from study entry until progression is documented, or death; whichever comes sooner. Progressive disease is defined as at least a 5 mm absolute increase and a 20% relative increase in the sum of measurable target lesions' longest dimensions relative to the smallest sum at baseline or on study or the appearance of new lesions or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions., Tumor measurements were done at 8 and 16 weeks after initiating treatment and then every 12 weeks and compared with baseline measurements prior to treatment. Measurements are continued until disease progression is documented or death.|Frequency and Severity of CTCAE (Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events) Version 4, Maximum grade of physician assessed adverse events graded and categorized using Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4, Assessed throughout the treatment period and for 30 days after discontinuation of treatment. Treatment continues until progression of disease.|Median Survival, Survival is defined as the duration alive from study entry until death., Following treatment discontinuation, patients are followed quarterly for 2 years, semi-annually for 3 more years, annually thereafter.
Hormone Receptor Immunohistochemistry, To determine if relevant biomarkers correlate with response to treatment in each of the two arms. Unstained sections of tumor tissue will be used for hormone receptor (estrogen receptor-alpha, estrogen receptor-beta, progesterone receptor-A, progesterone receptor B and the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor, GPR-30) immunohistochemistry., At study entry|mTOR Pathway Immunohistochemistry, To determine if relevant biomarkers correlate with response to treatment in each of the two arms. Unstained sections of tumor tissue will be used for mTOR pathway (including phosphorylated S6 ribosomal protein, PTEN, total and phosphorylated AKT, total and phosphorylated mTOR, and phospho-ERK1/2) immunohistochemistry, At study entry|Mutation Analysis, To determine if relevant biomarkers correlate with response to treatment in each of the two arms. Unstained sections of tumor tissue and DNA extracted from whole blood will be used for mutational analysis (including PTEN, PIK3CA, KRAS, and CTNNB1 (beta-catenin) performed using a sequencing panel assay., At study entry
