ICG and Blue Dye Guided Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Patients Underwent Neoadjuvant Therapy
The value of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in patients underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy is controversial. Lower detection rate and higher false negative rate are the main problem. The purpose of this study is to determine the detection rate and the false negative rate of SLNB by indocyanine green (ICG) in addition to blue dye (methylene blue) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with large or locally advanced breast cancer. This is a single arm clinical trial.
Breast Neoplasms
PROCEDURE: ICG+Methylene Blue
Detection rate of SLN, The number of successful SLNB / total number of SLNB, Immediate
False negative rate of SLNB, The number of patients with positive SLN / the number of patients with positive node, 1 week after the surgery|Adverse effect, Prophylaxis reaction, skin complication, Half a year after the surgery
Patients indicated for neoadjuvant therapy would be recruited in this study. During the surgery, SLNB using the dual tracing method would be applied before axillary clearance. After the surgery, histological results of the SLN and non-SLN would be analysed.
