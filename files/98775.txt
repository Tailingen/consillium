Camrelizumab, Pegaspargase and Apatinib With Radiation Therapy for Stage IE/IIE ENKTL
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of camrelizumab, apatinib, pegaspargase (CAPA) and as an intruction immunotherapy with radiotherapy as first-line treatment in patients with de novo stage IE/IIE extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type.

Extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTCL), nasal type, is a rare subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) with relatively high incidence in China. Radiotherapy alone for stage IE/IIE diseases has good response rate but with high relapse rates, ranging from 20-50%. The combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy improved the long-term survival for patients with stage IE/IIE diseases. But the optimal treatment schedule has not been established. This study is designed with four cycles CAPA induction immunotherapy, followed by 50-56Gy radiotherapy as an approach for stage IE/IIE ENKTCL. The efficacy and safety of this treatment will be measured.
