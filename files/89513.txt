A Study of LY2584702 in Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of LY2584702 in Japanese patients with advanced and/or metastatic solid tumors for which no proven effective therapy exists.
Cancer
DRUG: LY2584702
Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Effects, A clinically significant effect was any event that was a dose-limiting toxicity event (DLT). DLT was defined as an adverse event related to LY2584702 during Cycle 1 (Day 1 to Day 30) that fulfills any one of the following criteria; Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 3 or 4 non-hematological toxicity; platelet count \<50.0 x 10\^9/Liter (L) with bleeding; CTCAE Grade 4 platelet count decreased; neutrophil count \<0.5 x 10\^9/L lasting for 5 days or longer; any febrile neutropenia; CTCAE Grade 4 anemia; participant risk due to increasing toxicity., Baseline through 30 days
Number of Participants With Tumor Response, Tumor response was assessed according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria version 1.1. Complete Response (CR) is disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR) is â‰¥30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions., Baseline to study completion up to Day 183|Pharmacokinetics: Area Under the Concentration Time Curve (AUC) of LY2584702, AUC of single dose is AUC(0-12hours), and AUC of multiple doses is AUC during one dosing interval at steady state., Cycle 1 Day 1: Predose, 0.5,1,2,3,5,8,12 hours; Cycle 1 Day 2:24 and 36 hours; Cycle 1 Day 3: Predose sample (before first dose on day 3); Cycle 1 Day 10: Predose,0.5,1,2,3,5,8,12 hours;Cycle 1 Day 17: Predose;Cycle 1 Day24: Predose;Cycle 2 Day 1: Predose|Pharmacokinetics: Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of LY2584702, Cycle 1 Day 1: Predose, 0.5,1,2,3,5,8,12 hours; Cycle 1 Day 2:24 and 36 hours; Cycle 1 Day 3: Predose sample (before first dose on day 3); Cycle 1 Day 10: Predose,0.5,1,2,3,5,8,12 hours;Cycle 1 Day 17: Predose;Cycle 1 Day24: Predose;Cycle 2 Day 1: Predose
