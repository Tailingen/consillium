Pilot Study of Neo-Adjuvant Everolimus to Treat Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma - Analysis of Biomarkers
This study will gather data on potential biomarkers in the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (kidney cancer) and investigate their use as indicators of disease response. The results could eventually enable doctors to match levels of therapy to levels of biomarker on an individual basis and to increase the chance of disease response in patients. This study will also test a new paradigm in the treatment approach of advanced kidney cancer by using the drug everolimus in a neo-adjuvant setting, with the overarching goal of decreasing cancer recurrence rates and improving patient outcomes and survival.
Carcinoma, Renal Cell
DRUG: everolimus
Response of primary tumor and metastases (if applicable) to everolimus in terms of tumor size and appearance (RECIST imaging response criteria) as determined by CT or MRI, From 6 weeks after starting neo-adjuvant everolimus until 1 year post-nephrectomy (or up to 24 months post-nephrectomy in metastatic patients)
Effect of everolimus on blood and tissue biomarker expression (periodic blood testing and tissue samples from baseline renal biopsy and nephrectomy) in and among patients with locally advanced and metastatic disease with respect to baseline values, From baseline to 1 year post-nephrectomy for blood biomarker levels and from baseline to nephrectomy (week 12) for tissue biomarker levels
