Biological Investigations in Active Surveillance (BIAS) IGAR 2008 I 19 in Prostate Cancer Using High Field MRI (3 Tesla), PET, and Biomarkers
This study will use high field MRI (3 Tesla), PET and biomarker to follow prostate cancers and determine if these tests can detect cancers that become aggressive.
Prostate Cancer
PROCEDURE: 3T MR Imaging|PROCEDURE: C-Choline PET Scanning|PROCEDURE: Gene Rearrangement
Primary objective to determine if we can accrue patients to this study in a timely manner., 2 years
Patient compliance, Patients followed for 5 years from baseline|Optimal imaging parameters to characterize prostate cancers, patients followed for 5 years from baseline|feasibility of detecting gene arrangements in prostate biopsies, patients followed for 5 years from baseline|Incidence of patients developing progressive prostate cancer warranting definitive treatment in an active surveillance protocol, patients followe for 5 years from baseline|The natural history of prostate cancer with these investigations, patients followed for 5 years from baseline|The sensitivity and specificity of these investigation in detecting prostate cancer, patients followed for 5 years from baseline|The sensitivity and specificity of these investigations in differentiating indolent prostate cancer from aggressive disease, patients followed for 5 years from baseline|The sensitivity and specificity of these investigations in detecting high grade disease, extracapsular disease and extraprostatic disease and disease progression, patients followed for 5 years from baseline
This study may lead to the identification of additional investigations that can monitor for signs of disease progression in active surveillance protocols. This can directly benefit patients by providing them with greater confidence that their disease is being accurately monitored. In addition, this study may be beneficial to the general management of prostate cancers by adding to our knowledge of these investigations characterizing prostate cancers.
