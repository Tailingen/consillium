Study of MK-4166 and MK-4166 in Combination With Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors (MK-4166-001)
This is planned to be a 5-part dose-escalation study to determine the safety and tolerability of MK-4166 monotherapy and MK-4166 plus pembrolizumab combination therapy, and to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) of MK-4166 and MK-4166 plus pembrolizumab by defining dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in participants with advanced solid tumors.

An AE could therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition that was temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product was also an AE.

Per protocol, the number of participants experiencing an AE was assessed and reported by arm (MK-4166 monotherapy and MK-4166 plus pembrolizumab combination therapy) as well as by dose cohort., From first dose up to 90 days post last dose (up to 27 months)|Number of Participants Discontinuing Study Treatment Due to AEs, An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which did not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.

Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition that was temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product was also an AE.

In Part A, MK-4166 doses will be escalated quickly in successive cohorts and based on safety events may progress to Part B, in which the preliminary MTD will be identified. Based on safety events the study may progress to Part C in which the MTD will be confirmed. In Part D, participants will receive escalating doses of MK-4166 plus a fixed dose of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) 200 mg to determine the MTD for MK-4166 in combination with pembrolizumab. Based on safety events in Part D, the study may progress to Part E in which the MTD for MK-4166 in combination with pembrolizumab will be confirmed.

With Amendments 05/06, the dose confirmation Part C will be removed and the dose confirmation Part E (combination of MK-4166 and pembrolizumab) will be limited to participants with advanced malignant melanoma.
