OTHER: Observation
PFS: Progression-free survival, The time length from the date of randomization to any of the following events: disease progression or death from any cause., 24 months
ORR: Objective Response Rate, The proportion of patients with complete response or partial response., 24 months|OS: Overall Survival, The time length from the date of randomization to the date of death., 24 months|TTD: Time to Treatment Discontinuation, The time length from the date of randomization to the date of treatment discontinuation., 24 months
In the study, 300 advanced primery liver cancer patients who received immune checkpoint inhibitors at first-line setting (N=200) or second-line setting (N=100) will be recruited. By analyzing the ctDNA and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) collected before and after the first cycle of ICI treatment, the dynamic changes of bTMB, ctDNA and the composition of immune cells will be detected. Combined with the tumor markers AFP, DCP and CA19-9, a noninvasive multiparameter model will be developed.
