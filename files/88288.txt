Efficacy and Safety of Pyrotinib in Patients With HER2 Mutation Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
Various driver gene mutations have been identified in lung cancer. Among them, human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) was identified in about approximately 2% of non-small cell lung cancers.Pyrotinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting both HER-1 and HER-2 receptors. This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Pyrotinib in patients with HER2 positive advanced Non-small cell lung cancer.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Pyrotinib
Objective Response Rate, To evaluate objective response rate 6-8 weeks after the initiation of pyrotinib, tumor assessment every 6-8 weeks after the initiation of pyrotinib, up to 24 months
Progression Free Survival, PFS is evaluated in 24 months since the treatment began, 24 months
overall survival, evaluated in the 24th month since the treatment began, 24 months|Safety and Tolerability, Number of Participants with treatment related Adverse Events as Assessed by CTCAE v4.0, 24 months|quality of life (measured by questionnaire), Change from baseline in Pain on the 11 point short pain scale (SPS-11), 24 months
This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Pyrotinib in patients with HER2 positive advanced pre-treated Non-small cell lung cancer.

To observe objective response rate (ORR) of pyrotinib in HER2 positive NSCLC. To observe Progression free survival （PFS）. To assess the overall survival (OS). To assess side effects. To evaluate quality of life. To explore the relationship between biomarkers and the toxicity/efficacy of Pyrotinib.
