Multimodal Monitoring of Radiotherapy Response in Squamous Cell Cancer
The study's aim is to define imaging and molecular bio-markers for prediction of radiotherapy response of squamous cell carcinomas, in an early treatment phase.
Squamous Carcinoma|Head and Neck Cancer|Anal Cancer|Lung Cancer|Esophageal Cancer|Cervix Cancer
Loco regional control, After completion of radiotherapy, 2 years
Loco regional tumour control (response), After completion of radiotherapy, 2 months|Patterns of failure, Time and location of recurrence, 2 years|Overall survival, After completion of radiotherapy, 5 years|Changes in imaging and metabolic data, As measured 1-2 weeks after start of radiotherapy, 1-2 weeks|Site specific toxicity, Measured as patient reported side-effects, 1 year
Patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head \& neck, anal canal, cervix, esophagus or lung will be assessed before start of radiotherapy and 1-2 weeks after start. Multi-parametric MRI and 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) will be performed in parallel to metabolomic analyses of tumour tissue. The investigators will correlate changes in imaging bio-markers to corresponding changes in tissue or blood bio-markers by repeated imaging and biopsies for better understanding of the image parameters.

The data from the two assessments will be used for identifying imaging bio-markers, predictive for outcome. The patient data will be divided into one set of data for hypothesis generation and another set for validation.
