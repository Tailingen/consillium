Validation Study of Linear Quantification of CD3+ Cells in Localized Colorectal Carcinomas
The purpose of this study is to confirm that linear quantification of CD3+ cells is a prognostic biomarker in localized colorectal carcinomas.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
Time to Recurrence (TTR), TTR is defined by the time between randomisation and the first event occured (Local or metastatic recurrence or death due to disease recurrence) whichever occured first or last follow-up ( Last news for patients without event (censored data)), 2 years
Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization to death any cause or last follow-up news (censored data)., until death|Disease-Free Survival (DFS), DFS is defined by the time between randomisation and the first event occured (Local or metastatic recurrence or second cancer or death (all causes)) whichever occured first or last follow-up ( Last news for patients without event (censored data)), 2 years
