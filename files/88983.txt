Pesticides--Health Fertility and Reproductive Risk
This project is designed to establish whether pesticides or other environmental agents have a role in the excess birth defects identified in the Red River Valley of Minnesota. In this human study, laboratory based health parameters will be used to key in health survey data. In vitro data will be developed to mechanistic information. Concordant results among these study features will provide a weight of evidence approach.
