Open-label Study to Evaluate Clearance of Superficial Basal Cell Carcinoma After Use of Imiquimod 5% Cream
An open-label study to evaluate the safety and the ability of Imiquimod 5% cream, applied topically, to clear superficial basal cell carcinoma and to keep it clear for 5 years of follow-up.
Superficial Basal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Imiquimod 5% cream
Number of Participants With Sustained Clearance Rate of Superficial Basal Cell Carcinoma (sBCC), Number of participants clinically clear of superficial basal cell carcinoma at the treated target tumor site at the 12-week posttreatment visit (ie, initial clearance rate) who remain clear during a 5 year follow-up period., 5 years
Number of Participants Cleared of Superficial Basal Cell Carcinoma at 12 Weeks, Number of participants cleared at 12 weeks(the number of subjects with no clinical evidence of superficial basal cell carcinoma at the target tumor site at the 12-week posttreatment visit), 12 week posttreatment visit
Evaluate the long-term sustained clearance rate, defined as the proportion of those subjects clinically clear of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) at the treated superficial BCC (sBCC) target tumor site at the 12-week posttreatment visit who remain clear during a 5 year follow-up period.
