MCARH109 Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) Modified T Cells for the Treatment of Multiple Myeloma
This study will test the safety of the study treatment, MCARH109, at different doses, to see which dose is safest in people, and to look for any good and bad effects of this treatment. The study treatment could stop the growth of the cancer, but it could also cause side effects.
Multiple Myeloma
BIOLOGICAL: Infusion of MCARH109 T cells
maximum tolerated dose (MTD), The MTD is defined as the highest dose with an observed incidence of DLT in no more than one out of six patients treated at a particular dose level. All patients treated in a dose cohort will be observed a minimum of 30 days before the T cell dose can be escalated., 1 year
overall response rate (ORR), Assessed by the IMWG 2016 criteria.The major criteria for determination of response to therapy in patients with MM include examination of the peripheral blood and bone marrow. Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy obtained at approximately 1 and 4 weeks following the T cell infusion will be used for disease response assessment. Definitions for response assessment will be as defined by the pending update to the international myeloma working group (IMWG) guidelines, approximately 1 and 4 weeks following the T cell infusion
