Atezolizumab and Pre-Surgical Brain Radiation Therapy for Glioblastoma Multiforme
This is a single-arm pilot study that will recruit 12 patients with newly diagnosed Glioblastoma, a malignant brain tumor with a poor prognosis. Patients will be treated with fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT) for 2 weeks, in addition to two doses of Atezolizumab (Tecentriq), an FDA approved PD- L1 inhibitor drug, 840 mg IV, at the beginning and at the end of the two-week time period, concomitantly with FSRT. After this initial two weeks treatment the patients will undergo craniotomy and maximal safe resection as per normal care for a GB. After surgery patients will follow the normal care for glioblastoma in addition to Atezolizumab 840 mg IV q2 weeks for the duration of adjuvant treatment.
