Facilitate the Return to Work of Cancer Survivors
Cancer patients could experience physical limitations, cognitive symptoms, fatigue and pain, that could be perceived at diagnosis but may also occur during treatment, limiting the person from carrying out their activities of daily living, including work tasks. Return to work is a major goal, as it facilitates the patient's ability to deal with the disease and improve general health.

At present, there is no path aimed at supporting cancer patients in the return to work process. Because of this, the investigators want to assess the feasibility of a multidisciplinary social-health care pathway aimed at manage the difficulties that cancer patients might perceive in the return to work process.

To receive the support from the social-health care pathway, cancer survivors should go to an information desk service (called Informa Salute) located in the hospital. Here, sociodemographic and work-related data will be collected with the aim to organize the tailored social-health support to facilitate the return to work.

The social-health care pathway created includes: the local Health Authority of Reggio Emilia and the local Order of Physicians, voluntary non-profit associations, vocational and educational training bodies, social cooperatives, one labor union and one chartered accountant enterprise.
