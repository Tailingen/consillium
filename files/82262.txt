ARTEMIS-001: Phase 1 Study of the HS-20093 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
HS-20093 is a fully humanized IgG1 antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) which specifically binds to B7-H3, a target wildly expressed on solid tumor cells. The objectives of this study are to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor activity of HS-20093 in Chinese advanced solid tumor patients.

This is a phase 1, open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation and expansion study evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK), and the therapeutic potential of HS-20093 as a monotherapy in subjects with advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: HS-20093 (Phase Ia: Dose escalation)|DRUG: HS-20093 (Phase Ib: Dose expansion)
Ⅰa (Dose-Escalation Stage): Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for HS-20093, To determine the MTD for further evaluation of IV administration of HS-20093 in subjects with advanced solid tumors., Up to day 21 from the first dose|Ⅰb (Dose-Expansion Stage): Objective response rate (ORR) determined by investigators according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, Objective tumor response for target lesions will be assessed by imaging/measurement compared with the overall tumor burden at baseline (Day -28 to -1). ORR is evaluated by the number of participants with best overall response of complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) \[Confirmed CR/PR assessment require at least one repeat (≥4 weeks)\]., From the first dose up to PD or withdrawal from study, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months
Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs), AE assessed by investigator exclusively related to subject's underlying disease or medical condition \[graded according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 5.0\]. Any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Incidence and severity of AEs are assessed according to vital signs, laboratory variables, physical examination, electrocardiogram, etc., From the first dose through 90 days post end of treatment|Observed maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of HS-20093 in participants with advanced solid tumor, Cmax will be obtained following administration of the first dose of HS-20093 during the first cycle., From pre-dose to 14 days after the first dose on Cycle 1|Time to reach maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) of HS-20093 following the first dose in participants with advanced solid tumor, Tmax will be obtained following administration of the first dose of HS-20093 during the first cycle., From pre-dose to 14 days after the first dose on Cycle 1|Terminal half-life (T1/2) of HS-20093 following IV dose in participants with advanced solid tumor, Apparent terminal half-life is the time measured for the concentration to decrease by one half. Terminal half-life calculated by natural log 2 divided by λz., From pre-dose to 14 days after the first dose on Cycle 1|Area under plasma concentration versus time curve from zero to last sampling time (AUC0-t) following the first dose of HS-20093, Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time zero to the last sampling time when the concentration was no less than the lower limit of quantification (LLQ). AUC0-t was calculated according to the mixed log-linear trapezoidal rule., From pre-dose to 14 days after the first dose on Cycle 1|Percentage of participants with antibodies to HS-20093 in serum, Serum samples were collected for the determination of anti-drug antibody (ADA) at designated time points., From pre-dose to 90 days post end of treatment|ORR determined by investigators according to RECIST 1.1 (dose-escalation stage), Objective tumor response for target lesions will be assessed by imaging/measurement compared with the overall tumor burden at baseline (Day -28 to -1). ORR is evaluated by the number of participants with best overall response of CR and PR (Confirmed CR/PR assessment require at least 1 repeat)., From the first dose up to PD or withdrawal from study, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months|Duration of response (DOR) determined by investigators according to RECIST 1.1, DoR was defined as the period from the first occurrence of CR or PR to PD or death from any cause. If no PD or death after CR/PR, the cut-off date of progression-free survival (PFS) would be used \[Confirmed CR/PR assessment require at least one repeat (≥4 weeks)\]., From the first dose up to PD or death, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months|Disease control rate (DCR) determined by investigators according to RECIST 1.1, Objective tumor response for target lesions will be assessed by imaging/measurement compared with the overall tumor burden at baseline (Day -28 to -1). DCR was evaluated by the number of participants with best overall response of CR, PR and stable disease (SD) \[Confirmed CR/PR assessment require at least one repeat (≥4 weeks); SD shall be assessed at least 5 weeks after the first dose\]., From the first dose up to PD or withdrawal from study, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months|Progression-free survival (PFS) determined by investigators according to RECIST 1.1, Objective tumor response for target lesions will be assessed by imaging/measurement compared with the overall tumor burden at baseline (Day -28 to -1). PFS was defined as the time from random assignment (dose expansion stage) or first dose (dose escalation stage) to PD or death from any cause., From the randomization/first dose up to PD or death, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months|Overall survival (OS) (only in dose expansion stage), OS was defined as the time from random assignment (dose expansion stage) or first dose (dose escalation stage) to death from any cause., From the randomization/first dose up to death, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months
This is an open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation and expansion, first-in-human phase 1 study in Chinese adult participants with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. This study will consist of two parts: A Part Ia dose escalation stage and a Part Ib dose expansion stage.

The objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK and preliminary anti-tumor activity, describe the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) of HS-20093.

Part Ia: Participants with advanced cancer are eligible for dose escalation study if they have progressed on or intolerant to available standard therapies, or no standard or available curative therapy exists. The dose escalation will include an initial accelerated titration design followed by i3+3 design.

Part Ib: Enrollment into dose expansion will begin after identification of the MTD or MAD in Phase Ia. The dose expansion study will be conducted in populations with the following indications: locally advanced or metastatic non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)，extensive stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) and other types of advanced solid tumor.

All patients will be carefully followed for adverse events during the study treatment and for 90 days after the last dose of study drug. Subjects will be permitted to continue therapy with assessments for progression if the product is well tolerated and sustained clinical benefit exists.
