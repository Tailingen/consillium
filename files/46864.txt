Combination Chemotherapy and Tamoxifen in Treating Patients With Solid Tumors
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and doxorubicin, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Estrogen can stimulate the growth of tumor cells. Hormone therapy using tamoxifen may fight cancer by blocking the uptake of estrogen. Combining tamoxifen with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving cisplatin and doxorubicin together with tamoxifen works in treating patients with solid tumors.

DRUG: cisplatin|DRUG: doxorubicin hydrochloride|DRUG: tamoxifen citrate|PROCEDURE: conventional surgery|RADIATION: radiation therapy
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the feasibility and efficacy of cisplatin, doxorubicin, and tamoxifen (CAT) in patients with soft tissue sarcoma, glioma, mesothelioma, hepatoma, thyroid cancer, or adrenal cancer.
* Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

OUTLINE: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 1-2 hours followed immediately by doxorubicin IV over 15-30 minutes on days 1-3 and oral tamoxifen twice daily on days 4-17. Treatment continues every 3 weeks in the absence of the total cumulative doxorubicin dose reaching at least 500 mg/m2, disease progression, or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve partial remission (PR) undergo local surgery or radiotherapy, if feasible, to convert PR to complete remission.

Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year and then every 3 months for 2 years.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
