Orelabrutinib Combined With Rituximab Versus R-CVP in the Untreated MZLï¼š A Randomized, Open Phase II Trial
This study is a randomized, open-label, multicenter, prospective clinical trial aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of orelabrutinib combined with rituximab for the previously untreat MZL
Marginal Zone Lymphoma(MZL)
DRUG: Orelabrutinib|DRUG: rituximab|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Vincristine|DRUG: Prednisone tablet
CRR, The proportion of patients who achieve Complete Remission (CR) at the end of the combined antitumor treatment, up to two years
ORR, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with partial or complete response, up to two years|PFS rate at 24month, the proportion of patients who have not experienced disease progression or death due to any cause within 2 years of receiving the first dose of the study medication., Two years after the last patient was enrolled.|Safety parameters, Type, frequency, and severity of AEs, up to 3 years
For patients with advanced-stage MZL who require treatment, immunochemotherapy is the standard therapy, including regimens such as BR, R-CHOP, R-CVP, etc. The second-generation BTK inhibitor, orelabrutinib, has shown promising efficacy in relapsed/refractory MZL, suggesting that a chemofree regimen combining orelabrutinib with rituximab could also achieve good clinical outcomes in first-line treatment of MZL. However, there is still a lack of prospective studies to confirm this. This study plans to compare the efficacy and safety of orelabrutinib combined with rituximab followed by maintenance therapy with orelabrutinib to the R-CVP regimen.
