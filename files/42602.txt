Study on Vaginal Microecology and Cervical Local Immune Function in Patients With Uterine Fibroids of Childbearing Age
The study participants are patients with uterine fibroids and healthy physical examination subjects from the First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University (Shandong Qianfoshan Hospital). The main purpose of this study is to analyze the correlation between uterine fibroids and vaginal microecology and cervical local immune function in patients of childbearing age.
Uterine Fibroids
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Microscopic examination of vaginal discharge
Bacterial vaginitis (BV) of vaginal microecosystem-150 people in each group, Nugent score is currently an internationally accepted diagnostic method for BV. Lactobacillus, Gardnerella vaginalis, bacterioid bacteria and campylobacter with variable staining are evaluated by Gram staining and semi-quantitative evaluation method. The total score is the sum of the scores of the above 4 bacteria. 0 to 3 points: normal; 4 \~ 6 points: intermediate BV; â‰¥7 points: BV, through study completion, an average of 2.5 year
(1) In this study, 150 women of childbearing age who are diagnosed with uterine fibroids in the First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University (Shandong Qianfoshan Hospital) are selected as the study group; The differences of vaginal microenvironment and cervical local immune function are compared between 150 healthy women of childbearing age in the same period. (2) After the patients are enrolled, the general information (age, height, weight), menstrual status (age of menarche, menstrual period, cycle, bleeding pattern), clinical manifestations (abnormal uterine bleeding, infertility, abdominal pain), and previous medical history (hypertension, thyroid disease, etc.) of 150 patients with uterine fibroids will be collected. After the end of the first part of the experiment, 150 patients with uterine fibroids will be grouped according to vaginal microecological diagnosis, and the clinical characteristics of patients with uterine fibroids will be analyzed and compared.
