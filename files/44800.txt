Evaluation of Naloxegol in the Prevention of POI After Cystectomy
Postoperative ileus (POI) is defined as a transient reduction of bowel motility that prevents effective transit of bowel content and tolerance of oral intake following surgical interventions, especially after radical cystectomy. It remains a major factor associated with postoperative morbidity, length of hospital stay and medical costs.

In order to optimize perioperative care for patients undergoing radical cystectomy in a context of an ERAS (Enhanced Recovery After Surgery) program, we will evaluate the effectiveness of systemic pharmacologic opioid antagonist treatment.

Radical cystectomy (RC) with urinary diversion represents the gold standard treatment for muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Postoperative ileus (POI) is defined as a transient reduction of bowel motility that prevents effective transit of bowel content and tolerance of oral intake following surgical interventions, especially after RC. It remains a major factor associated with postoperative morbidity, length of hospital stay and medical costs.

Faster gastrointestinal recovery and prevention of POI are at the heart of ERAS (Enhanced Recovery After Surgery) protocols. In order to optimize the post-operative consequences of patients operated on for a cystectomy within the framework of a RAAC program, several provisions aim to alleviate post-operative gastrointestinal dysfunctions.

Naloxegol, peripherally acting µ-opioid receptor antagonist, is currently approved for opioid-induced constipation in Chronic Non-Cancer Pain, but its potential interest to prevent POI has never been assessed. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, the administration of Naloxegol for a limited duration as part of ERAS (Enhanced Recovery After Surgery) program will be evaluated to reduce the time of hospital discharge (length of stay) and to reduce the rate of postoperative complications. Priamry and secondary objectives will be compared between naloxegol and placebo groups.
