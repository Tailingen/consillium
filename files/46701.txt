Succinylated Gelatin for Prevention of Fluid Retention in Patients With Breast Cancer Receiving Docetaxel Chemotherapy
Breast cancer patients who received docetaxel chemotherapy were randomly divided into two groups; experimental group: the patients received intravenous infusion of succinylated gelatin one day before and on the day of chemotherapy, 500ml each time, once per day; control group: observation. Primary endpoint: total incidence of fluid retention. Secondary endpoints: severity and duration of fluid retention, change in quality of life score.
Fluid Retention
DRUG: Succinylated gelatin
Total incidence of fluid retention, Total incidence of peripheral edema, ascites and pleural or pericardial effusion of patients during the period of docetaxel chemotherapy, 6 months
severity of fluid retention, Severity of peripheral edema, ascites and pleural or pericardial effusion of patients during the period of docetaxel chemotherapy; the severity of pain was evaluated by National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0, ranging from 1 to 3 grades., 6 months|change in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast subscale score, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast（FACT-B）subscale during the period of docetaxel chemotherapy was assessed; the scores range from 0 to 144, higher scores mean a better outcome (higher quality of life), 6 months
