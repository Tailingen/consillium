HYDRA will consist of 5 fraction SBRT treatment targeting only grossly evident disease localized by examination and standard diagnostic CT, MR, and PET-CT imaging. Prophylactic coverage of uninvolved at-risk mucosal and nodal drainage basins will be strictly disallowed. The initial dose cohort will be treated to a total of 42.5 Gy in five equal fractions delivered every other day over a two week period (biologically equivalent to 66 Gy delivered in 2 Gy daily fractions), drawn from our successful institutional experience with similar dosing and fractionation for early-stage larynx SBRT. Escalation of total dose will proceed in 2.5 Gy increments, up to a final target dose of 50 Gy.
