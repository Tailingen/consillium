Effects of Neoadjuvant Therapy With Carboplatin, Paclitaxel Combined With Anti-PD-1 Drugs on Pain, Anxiety and Depression in Patients With Resectable Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
The goal of this observational study is to learn about the Effects of neoadjuvant therapy with carboplatin, paclitaxel combined with anti-PD-1 drugs on pain, anxiety and depression in patients with operable head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: a prospective cohort study
Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Carboplatin（ neoadjuvant）|DRUG: Paclitaxel （neoadjuvant）|DRUG: Anti-PD-1 Drugs|PROCEDURE: Surgical resection
Brief Pain Inventory (Short Form), The BPI-SF contains 15 items that measure pain severity and pain interference, with each item assessed on an 11-point numeric rating scale ranging from "no pain" (0) to "worst pain imaginable" (10)., Baseline, 9 weeks, 6 months, 12 months|HADS, HADS is a 14-item self-report scale, including two subscales: anxiety (HADS-A) and depression (HADS-D). The total HADS score ranges from 0 to 42, and the subscales range from 0 to 21., Baseline, 9 weeks, 6 months, 12 months
Major pathological response rate, Defined as the proportion of subjects with ≤10% viable tumor cells in resection specimens to total subjects, Within 30 days after surgery|Complete pathological response rate, Defined as the proportion of subjects without viable tumor cells in the resection specimen to the total subjects, Within 30 days after surgery
