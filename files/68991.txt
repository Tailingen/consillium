A Phase 1 Study of ZSP1602 in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics, and determine the maximum tolerated dose of ZSP1602 in participants with basal cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma of esophagogastric junction, small cell lung cancer, neuroendocrine neoplasm and other advanced solid tumors.
Basal Cell Carcinoma|Medulloblastoma|Adenocarcinoma of Esophagogastric Junction|Small Cell Lung Cancer|Neuroendocrine Neoplasm|Glioblastoma
DRUG: ZSP1602
Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLT), To determine the DLT of ZSP1602 in advanced solid tumor participants accessed by CTCAE4.03, At day 32 after first dosing.|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), The highest dose at the level with \<= 2/6 participants experienced DLT., At day 32 after first dosing.
Time to progression (TTP), For Part1 and Part2, From Screening, Day 28 of Cycle1 (28 days), then every 8 weeks, until disease progression or discontinuation from study (approximately 18 months or earlier if participants terminate from the study).|Over all response (ORR), For Part1 and Part2, From Screening, Day 28 of Cycle1 (28 days), then every 8 weeks, until disease progression or discontinuation from study (approximately 18 months or earlier if participants terminate from the study).|Cmax of ZSP1602, For Part1 and Part2, Protocol-defined time points during Cycles 0 (4 days) and 1 (28 days) of treatment per participants.|Tmax of ZSP1602, For Part1 and Part2, Protocol-defined time points during Cycles 0 (4 days) and 1 (28 days) of treatment per participants.|Cmin of ZSP1602, For Part1 and Part2, Protocol-defined time points during Cycles 0 (4 days) and 1 (28 days) of treatment per participants.|AUC0-t of ZSP1602, For Part1 and Part2, Protocol-defined time points during Cycles 0 (4 days) and 1 (28 days) of treatment per participants.|T1/2 of ZSP1602, For Part1 and Part2, Protocol-defined time points during Cycles 0 (4 days) and 1 (28 days) of treatment per participants.|Cl/F of ZSP1602, For Part1 and Part2, Protocol-defined time points during Cycles 0 (4 days) and 1 (28 days) of treatment per participants.
