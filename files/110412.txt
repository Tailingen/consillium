Study of CGC-11047 (PG-11047) in Subjects With Advanced Refractory Solid Tumors
This phase I study aims to assess the safety and tolerability of a new drug - PG-11047 - and to establish what happens to the drug once inside the body. An escalating dose of PG-11047 will be investigated in this study and the maximum tolerated dose of the drug will be established.
Cancer
DRUG: PG-11047
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), The MTD was defined as the dose below one-third of at least 6 subjects (e.g., 2/6, 3/9, 4/12) experienced a Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).

Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) used to determine the MTD had to occur during cycle 1 of treatment and had to be considered related to PG-11047., The MTD had to occur during cycle 1 of treatment
Preliminary Efficacy, As per RECIST Criteria (V 1.0) by radiologic evaluations: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR) \>= 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD; Progressive Disease (PD), \>= 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions; Stable Disease (SD), neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD., For the purposes of this study, patients were reevaluated radiologically every 8 weeks. In addition to a baseline scan, confirmatory scans were obtained 6-8 weeks following initial documentation of an objective response, when appropriate.
This is an open-label phase I, dose-escalation safety study in subjects with refractory solid tumors. The primary objectives of the study are to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of PG-11047. PG-11047 will be administered as a 60-minute intravenous infusion on days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28 day cycle. The planned minimum treatment schedule is 2 cycles (8 weeks) of PG-11047 treatment. Subjects who tolerate treatment may be eligible to receive additional cycles as per investigator's medical judgment. Evaluation of anti-tumor response will be performed every 2 cycles.
