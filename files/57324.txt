Development of AI Model for Renal Tumor Diagnosis Using CT and Lab Tests
This multi-center retrospective study aims to develop a multimodal artificial intelligence diagnostic model using preoperative contrast-enhanced CT images and routine laboratory parameters from patients with renal tumors. The model is designed to assist clinicians in accurately predicting the pathological subtypes of renal tumors preoperatively, enabling detailed diagnoses and advancing precision medicine.
