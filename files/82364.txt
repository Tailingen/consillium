The Development of an In-vitro System to Identify Gynecologic Cancer Cells During Surgical Procedures
The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of mid-infrared spectroscopy together with Attenuated Total Reflection (ATR), for the detection of gynecological malignancies in real time during surgery.
