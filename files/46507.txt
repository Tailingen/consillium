Ofatumumab Versus Rituximab Salvage Chemoimmunotherapy Followed by Autologous Stem Cell Transplant in Relapsed or Refractory Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma
This study is being conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of ofatumumab in addition to salvage chemotherapy versus rituximab in addition to salvage chemotherapy in CD20 positive DLBCL subjects relapsing, or with persistent disease, after first-line treatment with rituximab combined with an anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimen and be eligible for ASCT.
Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Diffuse
DRUG: OFATUMUMAB + DHAP|DRUG: RITUXIMAB + DHAP
Progression-free Survival as Assessed by Independent Reviewers, Progression-free survival is defined as the interval of time from the randomization date until the date of stable disease (SD; failure to attain the criteria needed for a CR or PR and no fulfillment of the criteria for progressive disease \[PD\]) after two cycles of salvage chemotherapy, progression, or death, whichever occurs first. Disease progression was based on the assessments of independent reviewers for the disease under study. Disease progression was based on imaging data via the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (RRCML)., From randomization until the date of stable disease after two cycles of salvage chemotherapy, progression, or death (assessed for up to 5 years)
Number of Participants With Overall Response (OR) and Complete Response (CR) After Salvage Chemoimmunotherapy, OR is defined as the number of participants achieving either a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR). CR is defined as the complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and disease-related symptoms. PR is defined as at least a 50% decrease from Baseline in the sum of the product of the diameters of target lesions. RRCML was used to assess CR and PR., At completion of up to 3 cycles of salvage chemoimmunotherapy (assessed up to 9 weeks)|Number of Participants With Overall Response (OR) and Complete Response (CR) Three Months After Autologous Stem Cell Transplant, OR is defined as the number of participants achieving either a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR). CR is defined as the complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and disease-related symptoms. PR is defined as at least a 50% decrease from Baseline in the sum of the product of the diameters of target lesions. RRCML was used to assess CR and PR., At 3 months after completion of autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) (assessed up to 6 months)|Event-free Survival, Event-free survival is defined as the time from randomization to progressive disease (PD; disease whose course is growth, or spread of the disease), stable disease (SD; failure to attain the criteria needed for a CR or PR and no fulfillment of the criteria for PD) after completion of 2 cycles of therapy, commencement of a new treatment for diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (e.g., radiotherapy), or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Disease progression was based on the assessments of independent reviewers for the disease under study. Disease progression was based on imaging data via the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (RRCML)., From randomization to progressive disease, stable disease after completion of 2 cycles of therapy, commencement of a new treatment for DLBCL, or death due to any cause (assessed for up to 5 years)|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. Participants who were still alive by the end of the study were censored., From randomization to death due to any cause (assessed for up to 5 years)|Number of Participants With the Ability to Mobilize at Least 2 Million Cluster of Differentiation (CD)34+ Cells Per Kilogram From Peripheral Blood, Stem cell mobilization is the process of stimulating the hematopoietic stem cells (CD34+) to move out of the bone marrow and into the bloodstream, where they can be collected via a process called apheresis. Successful mobilization is defined as the collection of \>2\*10\^6 CD34+ cells/kg. Only those participants, who commenced harvest, following the administration of rituximab or ofatumumab in combination with DHAP combination chemotherapy, were assessed. The number of participants with adequate harvest of CD34+ stem cells (at least 2\*10\^6 CD34+ cells/kg) after dosing of salvage therapy in Cycle 2 and Cycle 3 was analyzed., During Cycles 2 and/or 3 (Weeks 4-9)|Number of Participants Completing Autologous Stem Cell Transplant (ASCT), The number of participants who completed ASCT is reported., Approximately 4 to 6 weeks following Cycle 3 (assessed up to 3 months)|Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) During Treatment, The FACT-G was developed by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) group for use in adults in a wide range of oncology clinical trial populations. The 27 items of the FACT-G are scored in the following domains: Physical Well-being (7 items), Social/Family Wellbeing (7 items), Emotional Well-being (6 items), and Functional Well-being (7 items). Participants responded to the items on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 0, "Not at all" to 4, "Very much." The total score ranges from 0 to 108; higher scores indicate a better patient-reported outcome/quality of life. Participants were asked to think back over the past week when responding to the items., Baseline and the end of the treatment period (until approximately 4 to 6 weeks following Cycle 3 [assessed up to 3 months])|Change From Baseline in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Lymphoma Trial Outcome Index (FACT-Lym TOI) Total Score During Treatment, The FACT-Lym TOI is a measure that combines the FACT-Lym subscale (15 items; responses to each item range from 0, "Not at all" to 4, "Very much") with two domains taken from the FACT-G (responses to each item range from "Not at all " to "Very much"): Physical Well-being (7 items: lack of energy, nausea, meeting family needs, pain, side effects, feels ill, spends time in bed) and Functional Well-being (7 items: ability to work, work fulfilment, ability to enjoy life, illness acceptance, ability to sleep well, enjoying things done for fun, satisfaction with quality of life). This index is designed to be sensitive to changes in treatment regimens. The total FACT-Lym TOI score ranges from 0 to 116; higher scores indicate a better patient-reported outcome/quality of life. Participants were asked to think back over the past week when responding to the items., Baseline and the end of the treatment period (until approximately 4 to 6 weeks following Cycle 3 [assessed up to 3 months])|Time to Neutrophil and Platelet Recovery After Each Cycle of Salvage Chemotherapy, Neutrophil (absolute neutrophil count \[ANC\]) recovery is defined as ANC \>=0.5\*10\^9/Liter and increasing, and platelet (PLT) recovery is defined as PLT \>=10\*10\^9/Liter and increasing. For each cycle, time to ANC recovery is defined as the time from the first dose to the first ANC \>=0.5\*10\^9/Liter and increasing after the nadir in the cycle. For each cycle, time to PLT recovery is defined as the time from the first dose to the first PLT \>=10\*10\^9/L and increasing after the nadir in the cycle., From the start of each cycle for a maximum of 5 weeks per cycle (assessed during treatment period of Baseline up to approximately 3 months)|Time to Engraftment After High-dose Therapy (HDT)/ASCT, Engraftment is defined as 1) three consecutive days when the ANC is ≥0.5x109/L and 2) an unsupported platelet count of ≥20x109/L, and the engraftment date is the date that this occurs. If engraftment was not achieved by Day 42 or the last observation, engraftment was deemed to be a failure, and censoring took place at Day 42 or at the last observation., From ASCT up to 42 days post-ASCT (Baseline up to approximately 4.5 months)
As rituximab-based regimens have become standard first-line treatment in CD20 positive DLBCL, the efficacy of rituximab combined with salvage chemotherapy in the second-line setting has decreased and there is a need for new therapies in patients progressing or relapsing after first-line rituximab-based therapy. Replacement of rituximab with ofatumumab in the second-line setting, following progression/relapse after first-line rituximab-containing regimens, offers the potential to overcome relative or complete rituximab resistance and thus improve response rates, the ability to proceed to consolidative HDT/ASCT, and overall survival.
