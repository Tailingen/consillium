A Study Comparing Niraparib With Temozolomide in Adult Participants With Newly-diagnosed, MGMT Unmethylated Glioblastoma
The goal of this Phase 3 clinical trial is to compare the efficacy of niraparib versus temozolomide (TMZ) in adult participants with newly-diagnosed, MGMT unmethylated glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). The main questions it aims to answer are:

Does niraparib improve progression-free survival (PFS) compared to TMZ?

Does niraparib improve overall survival (OS) compared to TMZ?

Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms: niraparib or TMZ.

* study drug (Niraparib) or
* comparator drug (Temozolomide - which is the standard approved treatment for MGMT unmethylated glioblastoma).

The study medication will be taken daily while receiving standard of care radiation therapy (RT) for 6-7 weeks.

Participants may continue to take the niraparib or TMZ adjuvantly as long as the cancer does not get worse or completion of 6 cycles of treatment (TMZ). A total of 450 participants will be enrolled in the study.

Participants' tasks will include:

* Complete study visits as scheduled
* Complete a diary to record study medication
