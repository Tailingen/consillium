Combi-elastography Assessment of HCC Recurrence After Thermal Ablation Multi-center Study
Combined F index, A index,ATT index and spleen stiffness to predict tumor recurrence in different liver settings after thermal ablation of HCC.

Thermal ablation is one of the established method for HCC treatment. Postoperative recurrence of HCC is one of the major factors leading to poor prognosis of HCC patients. Most studies have shown that the risk factors of recurrence include tumor size, tumor number and intrahepatic spread, etc.

Besides, the carcinogenic effects of inflammatory activity and fibrosis in liver background caused by chronic hepatitis also be related to the recurrence. In the study, combi-elastography imaging technology , not only the F index which is related to liver fibrosis stage can be obtained, but also the A index which is related to inflammation activity can be measured, this may provide a more valuable method for tumor recurrence of early prediction.
