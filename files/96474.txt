Observational, retrospective, and multicenter study based on the review of the existing medical records of patients followed on an outpatient basis (computerized databases and dissociated data).

The design implies the incorporation of existing anonymized data by the hospital centers without leaving any record of the code assigned to each patient. The design, therefore, avoids the possible risk of the dissemination of the personal data of patients.
