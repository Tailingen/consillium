This is a phase 1/2, open-label, dose-escalation and expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and anti-tumor effect of GI-101/GI-101A as a single agent or in combination with pembrolizumab, lenvatinib or local RT over a range of advanced and/or metastatic solid tumors.

This study will comprise six parts.

* Part A: Dose-escalation and expansion cohorts of GI-101 monotherapy
* Part B: Dose-escalation and expansion cohorts of GI-101 plus pembrolizumab
* Part C: Dose-optimization and expansion cohorts of GI-101 plus lenvatinib
* Part D: Dose-optimization and expansion cohorts of GI-101 plus local RT
* Part E: Dose-escalation and expansion cohorts of GI-101A monotherapy
* Part F: Dose-escalation and expansion cohorts of GI-101A plus pembrolizumab

GI-101/GI-101A is a novel bi-specific Fc fusion protein containing the CD80 ectodomain as an N-terminal moiety and an interleukin (IL)-2 variant as a C-terminal moiety configurated via a human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) Fc.

GI-101A is an abbreviation of advanced GI-101 with an improved formulation for manufacture consistency.
