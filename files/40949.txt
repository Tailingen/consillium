Phase I Study of PI3(Phosphoinositol 3)-Kinase Inhibitor BAY80-6946 With Paclitaxel in Patients With Advanced Cancer
This open label Phase 1 study involves treating subjects with advanced cancer with BAY80-6946 in combination with paclitaxel. It will determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of BAY80-6946 in combination with paclitaxel. The trial will involve multiple participating sites from the US. Following determination of the MTD, an expansion cohort of 20 evaluable subjects with breast cancer was planned. Finally, 16 patients have been enrolled to treatment (Cohort 3). A new expansion cohort with modified dosing cohort is now introduced (Cohort 4: breast cancer expansion cohort with modified dosing) in which another 20 subjects are planned to be enrolled to treatment.
