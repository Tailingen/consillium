Risk Factors and Treatment Outcome of Oncology Children Hospitalized in the Intensive Care Unit Due to Sepsis
Children treated with intensive chemotherapy are at increased risk for life-threatening infections (sepsis). As the survival of oncology patients increased with the use of aggressive treatment protocols, there was also an increase in the need for hospitalization in intensive care units (ICU) due to sepsis.Several prognostic factors are known to affect the survival of these patients, including the number and type of damaged systems, the type of oncology disease and the duration of neutropenia. With the development of the treatment of ICU, the survival of the oncology patients hospitalized for sepsis has also increased.

We will collect demographic details, details of their oncology and infections, laboratory tests and imaging. The goal is to identify prognostic factors in oncologic children hospitalized in ICU due to sepsis, as well as clinical and laboratory parameters that characterize this group of patients.
