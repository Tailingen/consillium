Efficacy of Cryotherapy Combined or Not With Analgesics in Uncontrolled Painful Musculoskeletal Metastasis
The primary objective of this trial is to compare the efficacy of 2 analgesic strategies, based on percutaneous cryotherapy plus medical supportive care versus medical supportive care alone in the treatment of cancer patients with painful musculoskeletal metastasis.
Musculoskeletal Pain
OTHER: Cryotherapy + Medical analgesics|DRUG: Medical Analgesics
Time to analgesic strategy failure, Failure will be defined as at least, one of the following situations: Reescalation of the mean local pain by 2 points or more from the lowest pain score from baseline; Absence of pain relief â‰¥ 2 points 3 months after randomization; Indication of any other loco regional analgesic procedure (radiotherapy, interventional radiology or surgery)., Time from the date of randomization to the date of analgesic strategy failure assessed up to 6 months
Percentage of pain relief, Percentage of pain relief from baseline, rated by patients, Weekly for the first 3 months, then monthly assessed up to 6 months|Depth of local pain relief, Evaluation using the numeric rating scale, Numeric rating scale (scale range from 0 [no pain] to 10 [worst imaginable pain]): Weekly for the first 3 months, then monthly assessed up to 6 months|Depth of local pain relief, Evaluation using the Brief Pain Inventory, Brief Pail Inventory : Monthly assessment up to 6 months|The impact of local pain on the patient's quality of life, Using the FACT-BP questionnaire, Monthly assessment up to 6 months|The impact of local pain on the patient's quality of life, Using the EuroQOL-5Dimensions-5Levels questionnaire, Monthly assessment up to 6 months|Description of analgesic consumption, Using a booklet completed by the patients and/or the investigator, Weekly for the first 3 months, then monthly assessed up to 6 months|Overall Survival, Time from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause, From date of randomization to date of death from any cause or date of LPLV (estimated date: March 2020)|Tolerance profile, Tolerance assessed according to the NCI-CTC AE version 4, Date of last visit (Month 6 +/- 28 days)
Cost-effectiveness analysis, All the resources consumption will be collected during the 6-months timeframe: Hospitalization costs (outpatient, inpatient, and home care), external consultations and wider examinations (eg MRI), transportation costs., Date of last visit (Month 6 +/- 28 days)|Cost-utility analysis, All the resources consumption will be collected during the 6-months timeframe: Hospitalization costs (outpatient, inpatient, and home care), external consultations and wider examinations (eg MRI), transportation costs., Date of last visit (Month 6 +/- 28 days)|Budget impact analyses, Quantication of financial consequences of rolling out the innovative strategy throughout the health system (i.e. the replacement of Medical supportive care by Medical supportive care + Percutaneous cryotherapy), One-year baseline period. Will be performed in case the experimental strategy dominates the standard strategy
There is a substantial body of evidences that support the rationale for percutaneous cryotherapy in the treatment of painful musculoskeletal metastasis. Since the available results are based exclusively on retrospective and single-arm prospective studies, all authors agree that preliminary data deserves further investigation to provide high level evidences.

Current knowledge, along with the need for relieving patients' pain, already leads interventional radiologists to introduce analgesic cryotherapy in their routine practice. Our team usually notes a clinically significant pain relief that is immediate, continuous and prolonged in these patients. However, facing the lack of comparative studies, this technique is still proposed to patients with poor life-expectancy.

Percutaneous cryotherapy is an innovative strategy in the treatment of patients with uncontrolled painful metastases. It could provide a significant and durable pain relief and a better quality of life, earlier in the patient's care pathway.

The study group hypotheses that an early procedure of percutaneous cryotherapy is able to provide painful patients with better and prolonged analgesia and quality of life.

A prospective controlled study is proposed with two analgesic strategies (percutaneous cryotherapy plus medical supportive care versus medical supportive care alone) in patients with a painful metastasis not controlled by conventional analgesia strategy.
