Planning Margin Requirements for Pediatric Radiation Oncology
The planning target volume (PTV) and planning organ at risk volume (PRV) margins used for pediatric radiation therapy are empiric, and quantitative assessment of these margins is needed to improve therapy planning and delivery.
Pediatric Radiation
Acquire data to develop setup margin (SM) portion of the planning target volume (PTV) margin for pediatric tumor sites according to age, localization technique, treatment position, and the use of general anesthesia., 4 year
Estimate the number of patients required to develop a patient specific PTV and RTV margin recommendations., 4 year
Data will be gathered to develop a model to quantify the setup margin (SM) portion of the planning target volume (PTV) margin for pediatric tumor sites according to age, localization technique, treatment position, and the use of general anesthesia. Patient specific PTV and PRV margin recommendations will be developed based on the number of participants.
