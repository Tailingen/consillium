Colposcopy Findings Among Women With High Risk HPV Other Than HPV 16/18 and Normal Cytology
Abnormal cervical cytology was the most common reason for women being referred to the colposcopy unit. We prospectively included the women with negative cytology (negative for intraepithelial lesions or malignancy (NILM)) and positive High RiskHPV test other than HPV 16 or HPV 18. Comparing the immediate colposcopy findings among women with High Risk HPV other than HVPV16/18 and negative cytology and determine positive predictive values for CIN2+ of other high risk HPV genotypes
