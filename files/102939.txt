Oncologic Outcomes Based on Clinical Pattern of Preoperative PET-CT in Resected Pancreatic Cancer
The 18F-FDG-PET scan is currently being used for cancer diagnosis, staging, identifying hidden metastasis, and assessment of treatment responses in clinical oncology. Although there are important studies suggesting potential associations between PET-based parameters and oncologic outcomes, the calculation and official documentation of individual PET-based parameters might not be routine in clinical practice because these processes usually require time- and labor-consuming processes for the radiologists. In this study, the investigators prospectively determined clinical 18F-FDG-PET type according to degree of FDG-uptake in pancreatic cancer and compare oncologic outcomes between the types.
Pancreatic Cancer
DEVICE: PET-CT
Clinical PET type assessed by surgeons from preoperatively preformed PET imaging, Three surgeons will review the preoperative PET imaging and each will determine the clinical PET type as either K-type or Non-K type. Inter-surgeon agreement of clinical PET type will be determined. Clinicopathologic characteristics between K-type and Non-K type will also be analyzed., 1 week after surgery
Number of patients with recurrence of cancer or mortality from cancer following operation, 3 years
