Afatinib in Patients with Fanconi Anemia (FA) and Advanced Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC)
This research study is a phase Ib/II, single-arm, non-randomized, non-blind, multicenter study designed to determine whether Afatinib is effective and safe in patients with locoregionally unresectable and / or metastatic HNSCC with Fanconi Anemia.

The main hypothesis, based on preclinical evidence, is that treatment with afatinib, an epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), could be an effective treatment option to control cancer for patients with FA - HNSCC.
Fanconi Anemia|Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Afatinib
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Assessed by the investigator through imaging follow-up (CT scan/MRI) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. This will be considered as the percentage/proportion of patients with confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as their overall best response throughout the first 9 months after the first dose of afatinib. Objective responses will be assessed locally by the investigator according to RECIST, V1.1, and indicating the change in size of tumors as compared with baseline, at the first dose of study treatment., At 9-months after the first dose of study treatment
Disease control rate (DCR), Percentage/proportion of patients with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), according to ORR definition for the trial, or maintained stable disease (SD) as their overall best response, assessed by imaging follow-up (CT scan/MRI) and RECIST V1.1 criteria. Stable disease should be maintained for at least 4 months to be considered as a DCR event., Throughout the study period, at least 9 months|Duration of response (DoR), Time from first confirmed response (CR or PR), according to ORR definition for the trial, to the date of the documented progression of the disease (PD) as determined using RECIST V1.1 criteria or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Those patients with response and without PD or death event will be censored on the date of their last tumor assessment., Throughout the study period, at least 9 months|Disease-free survival (DFS), Time from first dosing date to the date of PD /secondary primary tumor (SPT) according to RECIST V1.1. Patients alive and free of events at the date of the analysis will be censored at their last known tumor assessment. Patients who start a new treatment line without progression /SPT will be censored on the date of first dose of the subsequent anticancer treatment., Throughout the study period, at least 9 months|Overall survival (OS), defined as the time elapsed from the first dose of study treatment until death from any cause. We will assess the median OS, estimated by Kaplan-Meier. Patients alive and free of events at the date of the analysis will be censored at their last known contact., Throughout the study period, at least 9 months|Patient reported health-related quality of life (HRQoL) QLQ-C30, assessed through the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), version 3. The endpoint will report a numerical value that ranges from 0 to 100. Higher values indicate better performances status for all items but for symptoms, in which higher indicates greater or stronger symptoms., At baseline and every 8 weeks until tumor recurrence, approximately 9 months|Patient reported health-related quality of life (HRQoL) QLQ-HN43, assessed through the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire EORTC head and neck cancer specific complementary module QLQ-HN43. The endpoint will report a numerical value that ranges from 0 to 100. Higher values indicate better performances status for all items but for symptoms, in which higher indicates greater or stronger symptoms., At baseline and every 8 weeks until tumor recurrence, approximately 9 months|Patient reported health-related quality of life (HRQoL) EQ-5D, assessed through the EQ-5D Health Status Questionnaire. The endpoint will report a numerical value that ranges from 0 to 100. Higher values indicate better performances status for all items but for symptoms, in which higher indicates greater or stronger symptoms., At baseline and every 8 weeks until tumor recurrence, approximately 9 months|Rate of severe toxicities, Percentage of patients experiencing Grade 3-5 treatment-related Adverse events (AEs) ) assessed by national cancer institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events CTCAE v5.0, Throughout the study period, at least 9 months
