Incidence of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Reactivation in HBsAg Negative/HBcAb Positive Lymphoma Patients Treated With RCHOP
The aim of this study is to identify the incidence of hepatitis B virus reactivation rate in Diffuse Large B Cell or high grade Follicular lymphoma patients with prior resolved hepatitis B undergoing RCHOP immuno-chemotherapy.
Lymphoma
DRUG: nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor
incidence of HBV reactivation, HBV reactivation is defined as- the level of HBV-DNA exceeds the upper limit of normal(ULN)., from the first cycle of RCHOP (day 1) to six months after the last cycle of RCHOP
the outcome of antiviral therapy in HBV-DNA abnormal patients, Once the level of HBV-DNA exceeds the upper limit of normal, antiviral therapy will be given immediately.Liver function and serum HBsAg and HBcAg of these patients will be monitored until six months after the last dosing of RCHOP., from the initiation of antiviral thearpy to six months after the last cycle of RCHOP
The aim of this study is to identify the incidence of hepatitis B virus reactivation rate in Diffuse Large B Cell or high grade Follicular lymphoma patients with prior resolved hepatitis B undergoing RCHOP immuno-chemotherapy.
