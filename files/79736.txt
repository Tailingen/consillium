Group Intervention to Increase Physical Activity in Childhood Cancer Survivors
The primary aim of this randomized, controlled study is to evaluate the impact and feasibility of a prolonged physical activity intervention in school-aged childhood cancer survivors who self-report sedentary lifestyles. The study will test the hypothesis that childhood cancer survivors participating in a physical activity intervention guided by Social Cognitive Theory will increase the amount of time spent daily in moderate to vigorous physical activity, and improve exercise self-efficacy compared to children randomized to usual care. A secondary aim is to assess the impact of the intervention on cardiovascular risk factors including fitness and body composition.
Pediatric Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Intervention, Camp plus reunions
Change in level of physical activity, Physical activity will be measured with Accelerometers worn for 4 days pre-study and six months later, change from pre-study and at 6months after camp
Change in Self efficacy, Self efficacy is measured with a questionnaire, Change in self efficacy measrued prestudy and 6 months after camp
