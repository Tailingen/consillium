Gemcitabine-Carboplatin Versus Gemcitabine-Oxaliplatin in Cisplatin-unfit Urothelial Carcinoma
Cisplatin-based chemotherapy is the standard regimen for advanced urothelial carcinoma.

But cisplatin-unfit patients account for up to 30-40% of patients in clinical practice.

Recently reported phase II/III trial of EORTC 30986 comparing gemcitabine/carboplatin (GCb) with MCAVI (Methotrexate, Carboplatin, Vinblastine) suggested that GCb be the preferred regimen over MCAVI based on the response rates, adverse events, and severe acute toxicities.

But the grade 3 or worse toxicities associated with GCb are not infrequent and need more effective and more tolerable regimens.

GemOx has been reported to be effective and have very favorable toxicity profiles.
