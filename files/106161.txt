This is a multi-center, open-label, non-randomized, phase I study
Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: LEE011|DRUG: Buparlisib|DRUG: Letrozole
Incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), Dose Escalation Phase: Frequency of DLTs at each dose level associated with administration of LEE011, buparlisib, and letrozole in a 28 day cycle, 28 days|Safety and tolerability of the combination of LEE011, buparlisib, and letrozole, Dose Expansion Phase: Incidence of AEs, SAEs (overal and severity), laboratory abnormalities, ECG, vital, dose interteruptions, dose reductions, and dose intensity as a measure of safety and tolerability., approximately 25 months
Safety and tolerabiity of the combination of LEE011, buparlisib, and letrozole, Dose Escalation Phase: Incidence of AEs, SAEs (overall and severity), laboratory abnormalities, ECG, vital, dose interterruptions, dose reductions, and dose intensity as a measure of safety and tolerability., approximately 25 months|Pharmacokinetic paramters such as AUClast and Cmax of LEE011, buparlisib, and letrozole in order to characterize the PK profiles, Dose Escalation Phase: When given in combination as well any other clinically significant metabolites that may be identified, approximately 25 months|Pharmacokinetic paramters such as AUClast and Cmax of LEE011, buparlisib, and letrozole in order to characterize the PK profiles, Dose Expansion Phase: When given in combination as well as any other clinically significant metabolites that may be identified, approximately 25 months|Disease control rate, Dose Expansion Phase: Proportion of patients with the best overall response of CR (complete response), PR (partial response), or SD (stable disease), approximately 25 months|PFS (progression free survival), Dose Expansion Phase: Time from date of start of treatment to date of first documented progression or death due to any cause., approximately 25 months
