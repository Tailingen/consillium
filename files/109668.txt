Trial of Dose Escalated BGB324 in Previously Treated Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.
This study is being done to evaluate the safety of the investigational study drug, BGB324 when administered in combination with docetaxel, and to establish the maximum tolerated dose.
Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma
DRUG: BGB324|DRUG: Docetaxel
Determine the maximum tolerated dose of BGB324 in combination with docetaxel, Determine and recommended the Phase 2 dose of BGB324 administered with the standard dose of docetaxel in patients in NSCLC by pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic assessments., 42 days or 2 cycles of 21 days
Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide with an estimated incidence of 1.6 million cases resulting in 1.4 million deaths in annually. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents 80-85% of cases, and adenocarcinoma is the most common histology.2 The majority of NSCLC patients present with advanced or metastatic disease that is not amenable to surgical resection. Platinum-based combination chemotherapy has reached a therapeutic plateau with a median overall survival (OS) of 7.4 to 9.9 months.

BGB324 is a potent selective small molecule inhibitor of Axl, a surface membrane protein kinase receptor that is over-expressed in many metastatic solid tumors and has been identified as a marker of a poor prognosis in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
