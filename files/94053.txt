Second Look Laparoscopy in Colorectal Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a second-look laparoscopy, followed by peritonectomy, hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) or systemic chemotherapy in case of peritoneal carcinosis, improves the overall survival of patients who have had radical resection of mucinous colorectal cancer.

Patients will be entered into the study after radical resection of mucinous colorectal cancer, and reevaluated by CT scan after 6 months. Patients with no evidence of disease will be randomized to receive either standard follow up, or to have a second look laparoscopy to evaluate for peritoneal carcinosis. After laparoscopy, those patients who do not have peritoneal carcinosis will continue with standard follow up. Patients with peritoneal carcinosis diagnosed by laparoscopy will be treated according to their peritoneal carcinosis index (PCI). For patients with PCI \> 20, systemic chemotherapy will be given according to Italian Association of Medical Oncology (AIOM) guidelines. Patients with PCI \< 20 will undergo peritonectomy and then receive intravenous chemotherapy immediately followed by HIPEC.
