A Long-term Survival Analysis of Different Surgical Method in Early Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The investigators established three prospective cohorts of patients with BCLC stage 0-A HCC, based on different surgical approaches (open, laparoscopic and robotic). After 5 years of follow-up, the investigators used propensity score matching (PSM) to reduce selection bias and then compared the long-term oncological outcomes of the three different surgical approaches, which might provide high-level evidence in non-randomized observational studies.
Long-term Effects of Cancer Treatment
PROCEDURE: liver resection
Overall Survival, The primary outcomes of this study included long-term oncological outcomes of OS, 14/02/2015-30/06/2021|Disease free Survival, The primary outcomes of this study included long-term oncological outcomes of DFS, 14/02/2015-30/06/2021
postoperative complications, Postoperative morbidity and mortality were assessed according to the Clavien-Dindo classification, 14/02/2015-30/06/2021|Textbook Outcome in liver surgery (TOLS), Textbook Outcome in liver surgery (TOLS), was defined as the absence of intraoperative incidents of grade 2 or higher, postoperative bile leak grade B or C, severe postoperative complications, readmission within 30 days after discharge, in-hospital mortality, and the presence of R0 resection margin., 14/02/2015-30/06/2021
In this study, three prospective cohorts of patients with BCLC stage 0-A HCC, underwent complete liver resection using different surgical approaches (OLR, LLR, and RALR), were established. After adequate periods of follow-up, the long-term oncological outcomes of the three different surgical approaches were compared, providing a higher level of evidence using a non-randomized comparative study based on propensity score matching (PSM) analysis.
