Liquid Biopsy for the Diagnosis of Intestinal-type Adenocarcinoma of the Ethmoid (BLADE)
The role of this transversal study is to assess the specificity and sensitivity of liquid biopsy to detect circulating cells tumor of adenocarcinoma of the ethmoid.

Blood sample of participants will be collected at the moment of the surgical procedure or recurrence diagnosis; immediately after surgery; at day 8-10; at month 2-3 of postoperative follow-up.

Two comparison groups will be studied: one age and gender-matched group and one professional exposure-matched group to assess the sensitivity and specificity of liquid biopsy
