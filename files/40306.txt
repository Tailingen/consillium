Soft Tissue Sarcoma|Doxorubicin|Radiotherapy

Major Pathological Response rate, Typically defined as residual tumor cells ≤10% in the surgical specimen after treatment, 3 months|Pathologic Complete Response rate, Absence of any residual tumor cells in the surgical specimen following treatment., 3 months
Objective Response Rate, The proportion of patients in a clinical trial whose tumor size decreases (partial response) or disappears (complete response) after treatment., 3 months|Disease-Free Survival, The length of time during and after treatment that a patient lives with the disease without it progressing, 2 years
This is a a prospective, open-Label, and single-arm clinical study. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of using anlotinib in combination with doxorubicin monotherapy and radiotherapy as a neoadjuvant treatment for soft tissue sarcoma. For patients with the soft tissue sarcoma, the standard doxorubicin monotherapy regimen involves administering 37.5 mg/m² intravenously on days 1-2 of each 3-week cycle. The treatment includes 3 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (pre-surgery) and 3 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy (post-surgery), totaling 6 cycles. Anlotinib (ALC) is administered at 12mg/d QD，day1\~14, 21d/cycle. Neoadjuvant radiotherapy is conducted before surgery, starting after the second chemotherapy cycle, using stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) with a dose of 4\*10 Gy. Radical resection surgery is performed in the ninth week, after the third chemotherapy cycle.
