Capecitabine (NX) Versus Docetaxel Plus Capecitabine (TX) as 1-line Chemotherapy on Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC)
It is a phase III trial to explore the efficacy and safety of vinorelbine plus capecitabine (NX) and docetaxel plus capecitabine (TX) as first line treatment followed by capecitabine alone till Progressive Disease(PD). We plan to enroll 200 pts for limited budget and the non-inferior trend of the two curves is anticipated.
Carcinoma, Invasive Ductal, Breast
DRUG: Vinorelbine plus Capecitabine for 6 cycles, followed by Capecitabine|DRUG: Docetaxel plus Capecitabine for 6 cycles, followed by Capecitabine
Progression free survival(PFS), Progress free survival is defined as the time from first dose of test drug to the first recording of disease progression or the date of death in patients with no evidence of disease progression.

In addition to hazard ratios and associated 95% confidence intervals, the results from these analyses will, for each treatment arm, also be summarized by Kaplan-Meier plots, medians and 95% confidence intervals., Up to 2 years until disease progression or death
Safety Profiles, All adverse events occurring up to 28 days after last intake of study medication are to be recorded in the case report form. Safety profile will be analyzed by tabulating its occurring frequency and percentage per patient using NCI-CTC version 3.0. χ2 statistics will be used to test the differences in toxicities between the two treatment arms.

SAEs will be reported according to ICH-GCP., Up to 2 years until 28 days after last intake of study medication|Overall Survival, Survival will be measured from the date of first dose of test drug to the date of death (any cause) or to the date of last contact., Up to 3 years after last intake of study medication|Response Rate, Tumor responses were assessed on the basis of Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) 1.1 at 6-week intervals then at 12-week intervals after disease progression., Up to 2 years until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or death
We designed the randomized non-inferiority study. Main Inclusion\& exclusion Criteria include: 1) Histologically or cytologically confirmed breast cancer with unresectable locally advanced and/or metastatic disease; 2) Untreated patients with unresectable locally advanced and/or metastatic disease; 3) with at least 1 lesion measurable by radiological method(RECIST criteria); 4) Karnofsky Performance Status(KPS)≥70; 5) normal Adequate hepatic, renal, and bone marrow function; 6) Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks; 7) No previous chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer. Primary endpoint is Progression free survival(PFS), second endpoint are safety profiles (National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria 3.0, NCI-CTC 3.0), overall survival and response rate. During Primary study treatment, Arm A: Capecitabine: 1,000 mg/m2 per ora(PO) twice daily (day 1-14), Vinorelbine 25 mg/m2 intravenous(IV) over 3 hours on day 1 and 8, every 3 weeks, 21 days as one cycle and 6-8 cycles are required; Arm B: Capecitabine: 1,000 mg/m2 PO twice daily (day 1-14), Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 IV over 3 hours on day 1, every 3 weeks, 21 days as one cycle and 6-8 cycles are required. Patients who are responding (complete or partial), or whose disease is stable followed by Capecitabine: 1,000 mg/m2 PO twice daily (day 1-14) 21 days as one cycle until progression or unacceptable toxicity
