Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)
DRUG: MLE4901|DRUG: Placebo
Menstrual Cycle Duration, Assessment of the number of days between menstrual cycles (i.e., days between the start of a menstrual period and the start of the next consecutive menstrual period) from baseline to end of 28 week double blind treatment period, 28 Week double blind treatment period
Number of Menstrual Periods, Number of menstrual periods from baseline to the end of the 28 week double blind treatment period, 28 Week double blind treatment period
Following a Screening/Wash-out Period of up to 12 weeks, an 8-week Lead-in Period (starting with a progestin challenge) will be used to better characterize the study population. A Treatment Period of 28 weeks' duration will follow the Lead-in Period. Then, an 8-week Follow-up Period (i.e., no study drug) will be used to assess the durability of effects of MLE4901. The study duration will be approximately 48 weeks (11 months) per subject
