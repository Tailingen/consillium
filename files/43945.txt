Phase II Study of Myeloablative Double Unit Umbilical Cord Blood Transplantation in Adult Patients
This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of myeloablative double unit umbilical cord blood transplantation (dUCBT) in adult patients with hematologic malignancies. Two myeloablative conditioning regimens will be used in this study: (1) total body irradation (TBI), cyclophosphamide, and cytarabine, or (2) thiotepa, busulfan, and fludarabine.
