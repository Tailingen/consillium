A Phase II Prospective Trial of mXELOXIRI Reintroduction for mCRC
The objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of reintroduction of modified XELOXIRI combined with molecular targeted drug in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC)
Unresectable Metastatic Colorectal Carcinoma
DRUG: Capecitabine-Oxaliplatin-Irinotecan-Bevacizumab Combination
Reintroduction Rate, The rate of patients who receive reintroduction therapy after the first progression., Up to 18 months
R0 rate, resection rate, Up to 18 months|PFS, the time from randomization to the first documentation of objective disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 18 months|OS, the time from randomization to the date of death due to any cause., Up to 18 months|PFS1, the time from randomization to the first documentation of objective disease progression or death due to any cause before second-line therapy, whichever occurs first., Up to 18 months|ORR1, percentage of patients, relative to the total of enrolled subjects, achieving a complete (CR) or partial (PR) response, according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, during the first-line induction and the maintenance phases of treatment., Every 8 weeks, up to 18 months after last patient last visit|PFS2, from the beginning of the second-line treatment to the documentation of objective disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, up to 18 months after last patient last visit|ORR2, percentage of patients, relative to the total of enrolled subjects, achieving a complete (CR) or partial (PR) response, according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, during the second-line induction and the maintenance phases of treatment., Every 8 weeks, up to 18 months after last patient last visit
It is an investigator-initiated, single institution, prospective, single-arm clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of reintroduction of modified XELOXIRI combined with bevacizumab as first-line therapy in patients with unresectable mCRC. Eligible patients will receive 12 cycles of mXELOXIRI with bevacizumab and then MDT will be initiated to determine whether to perform a surgery or receive the maintenance therapy until disease progression (PD). At the time of PD, patients will re-introduce XELOXIRI plus bev at the same doses and schedule previously tolerated, for a maximum of 12 cycles.
