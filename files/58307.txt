Injection of 99mTc-nanocolloid and ICG to Identify, Retrieve and Qualify TDLN in Early-stage NSCLC
The patient wil receive intra- or peritumoral injections of 99mTc-nanocolloid if malignancy is found during a navigation bronchoscopy. A SPECT/CT-scan will be made to image injections sites and sentinel lymph nodes (SLN). If surgery takes place to treat the lung cancer, ICG will be injected and fluorescent lymph nodes will be extensively assessed by a pathologist.
Early-stage Lung Cancer
RADIATION: 99mTc-nanocolloid|DRUG: ICG
Feasibility of SLN procedure, This is a qualitative outcome measurement that will be assessed by the involved physicians based on the ability to inject 99mTc-nanocolloid and ICG, and the ability to detect the tumor draining lymph nodes based on their drainage patterns., During the study intervention
Successfulness of injection method (intra- or peritumoral), During the first intervention|Number of SLN found by SPECT/CT-imaging, On the day of the first intervention|Number of SLN found by ICG, On the day of the second intervention|Number of metastasis found by additional pathology, Up to two weeks after the second intervention
When malignancy is found during navigation bronchoscopy, study participants will receive intra- or peritumoral injections of 99mTc-nanocolloid. Following, up to 2 SPECT/CT-scans will be made to assess drainage of the injected tracer to the lymph nodes.

If patients undergo resection of the lung lesion, ICG will be injected. The involved lung tissue will be removed, followed by routine complete lymph node dissection. The fluorescent lymph nodes will be more extensively evaluated by the pathologist.
