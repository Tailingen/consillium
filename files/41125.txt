Safety, Tolerability, Immunogenicity, and Antitumor Activity of GEN-009 Adjuvanted Vaccine
In this study, Genocea is evaluating an investigational, personalized adjuvanted vaccine, GEN-009, that is being developed for the treatment of patients with solid tumors. A proprietary tool developed by Genocea, called ATLASâ„¢ (Antigen Lead Acquisition System) will be used to identify neoantigens in each patient's tumor that are recognized by their CD4 and/or CD8 T cells. ATLAS-identified neoantigens will then be incorporated into a patient's personalized vaccine in the form of synthetic long peptides (SLPs).

BIOLOGICAL: GEN-009 Adjuvanted Vaccine|DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, Adverse events will be graded according to the NC Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0, 1.5 years after first GEN-009 vaccination|T-cell responses to GEN-009 adjuvanted vaccine, Immunogenicity based on T-cell responses to GEN-009, 1.5 years after first GEN-009 vaccination
Antitumor activity of GEN-009 in Part B, Evaluation conducted based on RECIST v1.1 (and immune-related RECIST \[irRECIST\], where appropriate), 48 weeks after first GEN-009 vaccination
Long-term clinical outcomes of Part A participants, Disease recurrence, 1.5 years after first GEN-009 vaccination|Additional cellular responses after vaccination with GEN-009, Cytokine secretion, 1 year after first GEN-009 vaccination|Phenotype of circulating immune cells after vaccination with GEN-009, Measured by flow cytometry, 1 year after first GEN-009 vaccination|Tumor-infiltrating T cells after vaccination with GEN-009, Will be examined in tumor biopsies, 1 year after first GEN-009 vaccination
This first-in-human study of GEN-009 will be conducted in two parts in adult patients with cutaneous melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), urothelial carcinoma, or renal cell carcinoma (Part B only). In Part A, the safety and immunogenicity of single-agent GEN-009 will be evaluated in patients with the above-noted tumor types who have completed treatment with curative intent for their disease (eg, surgical resection, neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy) and have no evidence of disease (NED) at the time of initiating vaccination with GEN-009. In Part B, up to 15 patients in each disease cohort will be enrolled and evaluated for safety, immunogenicity, and preliminary antitumor activity of GEN-009. Patients in Part B will receive GEN-009 at the schedule selected in Part A, in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor therapy (nivolumab or pembrolizumab) at the approved dose and schedule per the United States Package Insert (USPI). In addition, up to 15 patients who enroll in one of the Part B disease-specific cohorts but whose disease progresses during the screening period therapy may be enrolled into a separate relapsed/refractory disease cohort.
