Safety Study of TroVax Alone vs. TroVax Plus Interferon Alpha in Patients With Renal Cancer
Patients with metastatic renal cell cancer will be enrolled to receive either Trovax® alone or Trovax® plus Interferon Alfa. The study will try to determine whether the use of Trovax® will delay tumor progression.
Carcinoma, Renal Cell
BIOLOGICAL: TroVax® (Immunological Vaccine Therapy)|DRUG: Interferon-alpha
Tumor objective response rate by RECIST criteria to TroVax® and TroVax® in combination with IFN-α., restaging every 9 weeks
Overall survival, restaging every 9 weeks|Progression-free survival, restaging every 9 weeks|Time to Progression, restaging every 9 weeks
Patients with metastatic renal cell cancer will be enrolled in the study if all inclusion/exclusion criteria are met. Once the patient is enrolled, and baseline tests have been completed, the patient will start treatment.

Trovax® alone arm:

Trovax will be given as an intramuscular injection every two weeks for the first two months, then once a month for the next 2 months, and then once every 2 months for up to a year.

Trovax® plus IFN-α:

Trovax® schedule will be the same as the Trovax® alone arm. IFN will be given on the first, third and fifth day of the week for a total of twelve weeks.

At every office visit vital signs will be taken. Every eight weeks a medical history, physical exam, performance status evaluation, chest x-ray or CT scan, abdomen/pelvis CT scan or MRI will be done. A blood sample (about 8-10 tablespoons) will be taken to test the immunological response to TroVax® on the same days that the patient receives TroVax® injections.
