A Study to Investigate the Efficacy and Safety of Ivonescimab Combined With Irinotecan Liposome as Second-line Regimen for ES-SCLC
This is an open-label, single-arm, prospective phase 2 study, evaluating the efficacy and safety of ivonescimab combined with irinotecan liposome for relapsed extensive stage small cell lung cancer, who progressed on PD-(L)1 -based first-line therapy.
Extensive-stage Small-cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: ivonescimab|DRUG: irinotecan liposome
Objective response rate（ORR）, Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of subjects with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), based on RECIST v1.1., Interval between the date of enrollment and the date of death from any cause, up to approximately 2 years
Incidence of Grade 3 or higher adverse events (AEs), Frequency and severity of adverse events measured according to NCI Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Event (CTCAE), version 5.0., Interval between the date of enrollment and the date of death from any cause, up to a maximum of 2 years|Disease control rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the proportion of subjects with CR, PR, or SD (subjects achieving SD will be included in the DCR if they maintain SD for ≥8 weeks), based on RECIST v1.1., Interval between the date of enrollment and the date of death due to any cause , up to a maximum of approximately 2 years|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the duration from the first documentation of objective response to the first documented disease progression (based on RECIST v1.1) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Interval between the date of enrollment and the date of death from any cause, up to a maximum of 2 years|Progression free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of first dosing till the first documentation of disease progression (per RECIST v1.1) assessed by the investigator or death due to any cause (whichever occurs first)., Interval between the date of enrollment and the date of progressive disease, or death due to any cause (whichever occurs first), up to a maximum of 2 years|Overall survival (OS), OS is the time from the date of randomization or first dosing date to death due to any cause., Interval between the date of enrollment and the date of death from any cause, up to a maximum of 2 years
Patients will receive ivonescimab at 20mg/kg intravenously, on days 1 of every 21-day cycle and irinotecan liposome 56.5mg/m\^2 intravenously, on days 1 of every 14-day cycle. Treatment will be discontnued in case of until the toxicity became intolerable, the investigator determined that there was no further clinical benefit (based on a combination of RECIST V1.1 imaging assessment and clinical status), 24 months of treatment was completed, or the study was withdrawn for other reasons.
