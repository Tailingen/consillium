A Phase I/II Study of [124I]mIBG PET/CT in Neuroblastoma
This study aims to show that 3-dimensional PET/CT imaging with a new novel PET tracer (called \[124I\]mIBG) can detect as many or more sites of neuroblastoma (a type of childhood cancer) compared to the recommended 1-dimensional routine scans (called \[123I\]mIBG planar scintigraphy).
Metastatic Neuroblastoma
DRUG: [124I]meta-Iodobenzylguanidine
Comparison of the Number of Lesions Detected as Positive by [123I]mIBG Planar Scintigraphy Which Are Also Considered Positive With [124I]mIBG PET/CT., Analysis of \[124I\]mIBG PET/CT and \[123I\]mIBG planar scintigraphy was performed retrospectively by four specialist observers. The analysis was performed and observers were blinded to each others scores. The observers subsequently reviewed the lesions identified and, where there was a difference in their separate scores, they returned to the images in order to reach an agreed consensus score. The number of lesions identified as positive by this consensus scoring (all lesions with a SIOPEN score of 4 or 5) were used to meet the primary objective., [124I]mIBG PET/CT imaging on Day 1, three to 21 days after routine [123I]mIBG imaging and before the start of any new anti-cancer therapy. A minimum interval of 72 hours was required between injection of [123I]mIBG tracer and the [124I]mIBG PET/CT scan.
Comparison of the Number of Lesions Detected as Positive by [123I]mIBG SPECT Which Are Also Considered Positive With [124I]mIBG PET/CT., Analysis of \[124I\]mIBG PET/CT and \[123I\]mIBG SPECT/CT was performed retrospectively by four specialist observers. The analysis was performed and observers were blinded to each others scores. The observers subsequently reviewed the lesions identified and, where there was a difference in their separate scores, they returned to the images in order to reach an agreed consensus score. The number of lesions identified as positive by this consensus scoring (all lesions with a SIOPEN score of 4 or 5) were used to meet the primary objective., [124I]mIBG PET/CT imaging on Day 1, three to 21 days after routine [123I]mIBG imaging and before the start of any new anti-cancer therapy. A minimum interval of 72 hours was required between injection of [123I]mIBG tracer and the [124I]mIBG PET/CT scan.|Determining the Causality of Each Adverse Event to [124I]mIBG and Grading Severity According to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 4.02., Documenting Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) (Graded According to NCI-CTCAE Version 4.02) and Laboratory Parameters and Determining Their Causality in Relation to \[123I\]mIBG and \[124I\]mIBG., Safety data was collected from the date of written informed consent and continued for seven days after administration of [124I]mIBG.
Neuroblastoma is the most common tumour of childhood after brain tumours. Approximately half of cases are high risk and despite extensive treatments outcome is very poor. More than 60% of high risk patients suffer relapse or further spread of their disease and long-term survival is below 10%. Existing imaging techniques are not sensitive enough to accurately assess the level of risk which is critical in determining the best choice of treatment. This study will compare a new type of imaging against the existing imaging techniques. The new scans use a new tracer called \[124I\]mIBG which is taken up by the cancer tissue much more than by normal tissues. This tracer can be used with a 3D imaging technique called PET/CT to pinpoint where the disease has spread and quantify the amount of disease. Patients will be those scheduled to have an \[123I\]mIBG scan for routine care during a planned break in treatment.
