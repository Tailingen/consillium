A Phase 1b/2 Study of Sonrotoclax (BGB-11417) as Monotherapy and in Various Combinations With Dexamethasone Plus Carfilzomib, Dexamethasone Plus Daratumumab, and Dexamethasone Plus Pomalidomide in Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of sonrotoclax as monotherapy and in various combinations in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) multiple myeloma (MM) and chromosomal translocation t(11;14).

The study investigates sonrotoclax alone and in combination with dexamethasone and other agents, including carfilzomib, daratumumab, and pomalidomide.

Part 1: Number Of Participants Experiencing Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs), DLTs will be based on National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 5.0 and will include most grade 3 or higher events, as defined in the protocol., Up to 28 days|Part 1 And 2: Number of Participants Reporting One or More Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation and Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs)., Up to 30 days after last dose of study drug|Part 2: Overall response rate (ORR), Defined as the percentage of participants who achieved a stringent complete response (sCR), complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), or partial response (PR) per International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria, Approximately 4 years|Part 2: Very good partial response (VGPR) or better response rate, Defined as the percentage of participants with a documented VGPR or better (including sCR, CR, and VGPR), Upon study termination (Baseline up to first documentation of disease progression [PD] or death from any cause [approximately 4 years]|Part 2: Complete Response (CR) or better, defined as the percentage of participants with a documented CR or sCR, Upon study termination (Baseline up to first documentation of disease progression [PD] or death from any cause [approximately 4 years])
Part 1: Area under the plasma concentration-time curve time 0 to the last measurable concentration (AUClast) After a Single Dose of Sonrotoclax, Cycle 1 (each cycle is up to 28 days)|Part 1: Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) After a Single Dose of Sonrotoclax, Cycle 1 (each cycle is up to 28 days)|Part 1: Time to reach Cmax (tmax) After a Single Dose of Sonrotoclax, Cycle 1 (each cycle is up to 28 days)|Part 1: At Steady-state: AUC last, ss, Cycle 2 (each cycle is up to 28 days)|Part 1: At Steady-state: Cmax, ss, Cycle 2 (each cycle is up to 28 days)|Part 1: At Steady-state: trough plasma concentration (Ctrough) ss, Cycle 2 (each cycle is up to 28 days)|Part 1: At Steady-state: time to reach Cmax (tmax,ss), Cycle 2 (each cycle is up to 28 days)|Part 2: Time to response (TTR) as assessed by investigator, TTR is defined as the time from start of treatment (for nonrandomized cohorts) or date of randomization (for randomized cohorts to first documentation of response of Partial Response (PR) or better, Approximately 4 years|Part 2: Duration of response (DOR) as assessed by investigator, DOR is defined as the time from the date of the first documented response (PR or better) after treatment initiation until the date of first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. DOR will be analyzed only for patients who have achieved an overall response of at least PR. The distribution of DOR will be summarized by the Kaplan-Meier method., Approximately 4 years|Part 2: Progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by investigator, PFS is defined as time from start of treatment to the first documentation of disease progression or death, whichever occurs first, Approximately 4 years|Part 2: Overall survival (OS) as assessed by investigator, OS defined as the time from start of treatment (for nonrandomized cohorts) or date of randomization (for randomized cohorts to the date of death due to any cause, Approximately 4 years
