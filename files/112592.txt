Study Investigating the Association of NP137 With mFOLFIRINOX in Locally Advanced Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma
The study will assess the safety of the association of NP137 with the standard of care mFOLFIRINOX in the treatment of locally advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.The study drug which is tested is the NP137 in association with mFOLFIRINOX to allow a better tumor response as well as better survival outcomes with an acceptable safety.
Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: NP137|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Irinotecan|DRUG: Calcium levofolinate|DRUG: 5 FU
Percentage Proportion of patients experiencing adverse events, Percentage Proportion of patients experiencing adverse events (AEs) of any grade and grade 3/4 AEs as defined by the National Cancer Institute - Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v 5.0) at 6 months., At 6 months
Best overall objective response rate (ORR), Best overall objective response rate (ORR) and ORR at 3 months, 6, 9, 12 months according to RECIST 1.1, At 3,6,9 and 12 months|Overall survival (OS), Median Overall survival (OS), 6 months and 12 months-OS rates. OS is defined as the time between inclusion and death (all causes). Patients alive will be censored at the date of last news., at 6, 12 and 36 months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Median Progression-Free Survival (PFS), 6 months and 12 months-PFS rates. PFS is defined as the time between inclusion and progression according to RECIST 1.1 or death (all causes). Patients alive without progression will be censored at the date of last news., at 6, 12 and 36 months|Median Duration of response, Median Duration of response is defined as the time between first dose of treatment and progression according to RECIST 1.1. Patients alive without progression will be censored at 6 months and at the date of last news., at 6 and 36 months|Quality of life (QoL), Quality of life will be studied by using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire for Cancer) at 6 months and at the end of study. A 5-point decrease of QLQ-C30 score will be considered as the minimal clinically significant deterioration of QoL., at 6 and 36 months|time to deterioration, TTD will be defined as the time from inclusion in the study to deterioration of EORTC QLQ-C30 score with a decrease ≥5 points at any time point after the baseline score, at 6 months and at the end of study, at 6 and 36 months|PK-PD evaluation, PK-PD evaluation: based on available PopPK modelisation and PK samples collected at the time of the response evaluation in this study, at 36 months|CA19.9 response, CA19.9 response will be defined as a percentage of patients with a ≥ 50% reduction from baseline CA19.9 level, at 6 and 12 months., at 6 and 12 months|proportion of patients reaching surgery, Percentage surgical resection with R0/R1 margins at 6 months and at the end of study., at 6 and 36 months|Mechanisms of EMT, To assess the mechanisms of EMT reversal by comparing different histological markers on pre-therapeutic biopsies with tumor samples obtained during surgical tumor resection. Descriptive study in spatial transcriptomics and immunohistochemistry of the evolution of EMT markers, Netrin-1 expression, and tumor microenvironment by comparing pre-therapeutic biopsies to tumor samples obtained during surgical tumor resection, At month 0
The study is a multicentric, prospective, single arm phase 1b trial. This study will enroll 43 to 52 patients and consists of 2 parts: Safety Lead-in Phase and Expansion Phase. Initially, 3 to 12 patients will be enrolled into a Safety Lead-in Phase based on a 3 + 3 design, with the possibility of dose de-escalation, to confirm the recommended dose of NP137.The Expansion Phase will start after completion of Safety Lead-in Phase at the confirmed dose and will include 40 patients. Patients will be assigned to the experimental arm (NP137 + mFOLFIRINOX).
