Perceptions on Expected Outcomes of Immunotherapy in Advanced Cancer Patients With Poor Performance Status
To better understand your feelings and expectations about immunotherapy
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Questionnaires|BEHAVIORAL: Interview
Discrepancy in expectation of survival for 2 years or more between the patient and oncologist, through study completion; an average of 2 years
Primary Objective:

1. To compare expectations of survival benefit from immunotherapy between advanced cancer patients with poor performance status (PS) and their oncologists. We hypothesize that, compared to their oncologists, patients will have expectations for greater likelihood of survival beyond 2 years.

Secondary Objectives:

1. To compare expectations of therapeutic benefit of immunotherapy between advanced cancer patients with poor PS and their oncologists. We hypothesize that, compared to their oncologists, patients will have expectations for greater likelihood of cure, quality of life improvement, and lower likelihood of adverse events.
2. To qualitatively describe the priorities and preferences for information of advanced cancer patients with poor PS when considering immunotherapy treatment.
3. To evaluate the associations between discrepant expectations with patients' sociodemographic and clinical characteristics.
4. To compare patient and oncologist expectations with actual treatment outcomes and survival.
