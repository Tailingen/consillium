Study to Evaluate Eflornithine + Lomustine vs Lomustine in Recurrent Anaplastic Astrocytoma (AA) Patients
The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of eflornithine in combination with lomustine, compared to lomustine taken alone, in treating patients whose anaplastic astrocytoma has recurred/progressed after radiation and temozolomide chemotherapy.
Anaplastic Astrocytoma|Recurrent Anaplastic Astrocytoma
DRUG: Eflornithine|DRUG: Lomustine|DRUG: Lomustine
Overall survival, 4 years
Progression-free survival (PFS), 4 years|Objective response rate (ORR), 4 years
Clinical benefit response (CBR) based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) criteria, 4 years|OS rate at 18 months (OS-18), 18 months|Relevance of OS, PFS, ORR, and CBR to commonly used molecular/genetic biomarkers obtained from most recent pre-study tumor samples, 4 years|Pharmacokinetic Analysis - Maximum concentrations (Cmax) of eflornithine in plasma will be determined., 1 Month|PK - Area under the curve (AUC) of eflornithine in plasma will be determined., 1 Month
This study will consist of 4 study periods of up to 50 months in total, consisting of:

Screening Period - A maximum screening duration of 4 weeks.

Treatment Period - Treatment Arm A up to 24 months; Treatment Arm B up to 12 months.

End of Treatment Visit - A minimum of 4 weeks post last treatment for both arms.

Follow-Up Period - Up to approximately 36 months, or until patient death.

A total of approximately 340 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either eflornithine + lomustine or lomustine alone.
