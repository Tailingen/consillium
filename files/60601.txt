A Study Exploring the Safety and Tolerability of INCB081776 in Participants With Advanced Malignancies
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and early clinical activity of single-agent INCB081776 (Part 1) and INCB081776 in combination with INCMGA00012 (Part 2).
