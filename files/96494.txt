Letrozole in Breast Cancer Who Have Received 5 Years of Aromatase Inhibitor Therapy
RATIONALE: Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using letrozole may fight breast cancer by lowering the amount of estrogen the body makes. It is not yet known whether letrozole is more effective than a placebo in treating in women with breast cancer who have already received 5 years of aromatase inhibitor therapy.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying letrozole to see how well it works compared with a placebo in treating women with primary breast cancer who have received 5 years of aromatase inhibitor therapy.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: letrozole|OTHER: placebo
Disease-free Survival (DFS), It is defined as the months from the day of randomization to the earliest date when a recurrence of the primary disease (recurrence in the breast, chest wall and nodal sites or the development of metastatic disease) or a contralateral breast cancer was observed. Subjects who died without recurrence of the primary disease or the development of the contralateral breast cancer were censored at their death date. If a patient has not recurred, developed a contralateral breast cancer, or died, disease-free survival was censored on the date of the last day the patient was known to be alive. Probability of disease free survival at 5 years is estimated and reported., Unitil the end of study with a median follow up of 75 months
Incidence of Contralateral Breast Cancer, The annual incidence rate was estimated based on the time to the development of contralateral breast cancer, which was calculated in months from the day of randomization to the diagnosis date of contralateral breast cancer for subjects who had developed the contralateral breast cancer, to the time of death for the patient who died, or to the last day the patient was known alive for subjects without contralateral breast cancer, 10 years|Overall Survival (OS), For subjects who died, overall survival was calculated in months from the day of randomization to the date of death. Otherwise, survival was censored at the last day the patient was known to be alive. Probability of overall survival at 5 years is estimated and reported., Until the end of study with a median follow-up of 75 months|Change From Baseline in Role Function- Physical Scale on SF(Short Form)-36 Health Survey, Difference between post baseline scores and baseline score of role function-physical scale on SF-36 Health Survey (scale range between 0 and 100 with higher score indicating better quality of life)., 8 years
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To compare the disease-free survival of women with primary breast cancer treated with letrozole vs placebo after completing approximately 5 years (i.e., 4½ - 6 years) of aromatase inhibitor therapy (e.g., letrozole, anastrozole, or exemestane).

Secondary

* To compare the effect of these drugs on overall (all cause specific) mortality of these patients.
* To compare the incidence of contralateral breast cancer in patients treated with these drugs.
* To evaluate the long-term clinical and laboratory safety of aromatase inhibitor therapy, particularly cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (e.g., significant coronary artery disease, including myocardial infarction and angina requiring percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass graft, fatal and nonfatal strokes, and all vascular deaths); incidence of all bone fractures (with particular emphasis on hip and wrist fractures as indicators of osteoporosis); changes in bone density; and common toxicities.
* To compare overall quality of life (QOL) and menopausal-specific QOL of patients treated with these drugs.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to lymph node status at diagnosis (negative vs positive vs unknown), prior adjuvant chemotherapy (yes vs no), interval between last dose of aromatase inhibitor therapy and study randomization (\< 6 months vs 6 months to 2 years), and duration of prior tamoxifen citrate use (0 vs \< 2 years vs 2 - 4½ years vs \> 4½ years). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

* Arm I: Patients receive oral letrozole once daily for up to 5 years in the absence of unacceptable toxicity, disease recurrence, or development of a second malignancy.
* Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo once daily for up to 5 years in the absence of unacceptable toxicity, disease recurrence, or development of a second malignancy.

Patients undergo bone mineral density measurement by DEXA scan at baseline (if not done within 12 months of study entry), at 24 and 48 months during study therapy, and at the completion of study therapy. Some patients also complete quality-of-life questionnaires at baseline and at 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months.

After completion of study therapy, patients are followed annually.
