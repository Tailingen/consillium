Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy of Nanoparticle Albumin-bound Paclitaxel/Carboplatin vs. Paclitaxel /Carboplatin in Stage â…¡ B and IIIA Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Lung
Albumin-bound paclitaxel plus carboplatin regimen in advanced NSCLC especially in lung squamous cell carcinoma has a better tumor response rate and safety, therefore.The main purpose of this study is to observe the safety and efficacy of albumin-bound paclitaxel / carboplatin in the treatment of lung squamous cell carcinoma of stage IIB and IIIA.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel/carboplatin
Tumor ORR and Number of Adverse Events, From date of randomization until the date of progression, assessed up to 2 months
PFS, From date of surgery until the date of first documented progression, assessed up to 30 months
The rate of pathology down-stage of lymph nodes, 1 day (the date of surgery)
Albumin-bound paclitaxel plus carboplatin regimen in advanced NSCLC especially in lung squamous cell carcinoma has a better tumor response rate and safety, therefore, this program is applied to neoadjuvant therapy, may obtain better tumor pathological remission rate, improve the operation resection rate, thus improve the prognosis.The main purpose of this study is to observe the safety and efficacy of albumin-bound paclitaxel / carboplatin in the treatment of lung squamous cell carcinoma of stage IIB and IIIA.
