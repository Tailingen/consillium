A Study of BMS-833923 With Carboplatin and Etoposide Followed by BMS-833923 Alone in Subjects With Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BMS-833923 administered in combination with carboplatin and etoposide followed by BMS-833923 alone in subjects with extensive-stage Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC).
Small Cell Lung Carcinoma
DRUG: BMS-833923|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Etoposide
Use NCI CTCAE to establish the MTD, DLT(s) and safety profile of BMS-833923 administered alone and in combination with carboplatin and etoposide, * NCI - National Cancer Institute
* CTCAE - Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
* MTD - Maximum tolerated dose
* DLT - Dose limiting toxicity, 28 days
