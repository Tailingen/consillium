Topical Menthol for the Treatment of Chemotherapy Induced Peripheral Neuropathy
Primary Objective: To assess whether six-week treatment with twice daily topical Menthol application will decrease neuropathic pain as measured by the change in Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF worst pain score), following or during neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy with taxane or platinum-based regimens among breast, gastrointestinal or gynecologic cancer patients.

Secondary objectives:

* To compare change in patient-reported outcomes: overall BPI-SF scales, EORTC-CIPN20, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Chemotherapy Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS-29) scores between study groups.
* To compare changes in dose delivery and early treatment discontinuation rates between study groups.
* To compare objective sensory and motor functional change from baseline with the use of quantitative neurosensory testing.
* To perform an exploratory analysis evaluating the interaction between treatment and chemotherapy type.

Change in Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form Score, The Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF) is a well-validated clinical tool used frequently to assess severity of pain and its effect on daily functions in patients with neuropathy. The instrument gives several ratings of the intensity and severity of pain and the degree of pain interference on activity, mood, sleep, relations with others and work. The questionnaire uses a 0-10 scale with a higher score indicating a worse outcome., Baseline and 6 weeks
Change in EORTC-CIPN20 Score, The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (EORTC-CIPN20) is a questionnaire measuring patient reported symptoms of chemotherapy induced neuropathy. Scores range from 20-80 with a higher score indicating a worse outcome., Baseline and 6 weeks|Change in Sensorimotor Function, Sensorimotor function as measured by a Bio-Thesiometer, which measures changes in vibratory perception. The Bio-Thesiometer is an electrical tuning fork whose amplitude can be gradually increased. Vibration threshold will be assessed at the dorsum of the distal interphalangeal joint of the index finger and dorsum of the interphalangeal joint of the hallux. Subjects will be asked to indicate when the vibration stimulus is initially felt (perception threshold) and when the stimulus disappears (disappearance threshold.) The vibration perception threshold is the average of three paired measurements., Baseline and 6 weeks
Chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN): CIPN is a debilitating and often irreversible toxicity associated with various chemotherapy agents widely used in the treatment of both solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. Clinical trials with Taxane-based forms of chemotherapy, commonly used in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer, have reported up to 33% grades 2-3 sensory neuropathy and up to 14% of motor neuropathy. Severity is closely related to chemotherapy dose and schedule. CIPN may also develop in up to 64% of patients treated with 12 cycles of Oxaliplatin based adjuvant chemotherapy, when assessed clinically and electro physiologically. Patients develop an axonal, predominately sensory peripheral neuropathy, of mild to moderate severity. Thermal hyperalgesia with cold allodynia was found to be a clinical marker of early oxaliplatin neurotoxicity and may predict severe neuropathy
