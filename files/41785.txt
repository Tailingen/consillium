A Study Assessing Risk Factors for Oral Mucositis/Stomatitis and Ocular Surface Events in NSCLC and Breast Cancer
This study will identify risk factors for oral mucositis/stomatitis and ocular surface events (OSE) in patients with advanced/metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and advanced/metastatic human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer.

Patient Demographics in NSCLC and Breast Cancer Patients With Oral Mucositis/Stomatitis or OSE Compared with Patients Without Oral Mucositis/Stomatitis or OSE, From NSCLC diagnosis (01 January 2015) or Breast Cancer diagnosis (01 January 2012) up to until death, exit from the database, or March 31, 2024, whichever comes first (approximately 12 years 2 months)|Clinical Characteristics in NSCLC and Breast Cancer Patients With Oral Mucositis/Stomatitis or OSE Compared with Patients Without Oral Mucositis/Stomatitis or OSE, From NSCLC diagnosis (01 January 2015) or Breast Cancer diagnosis (01 January 2012) up to until death, exit from the database, or March 31, 2024, whichever comes first (approximately 12 years 2 months)
It is important to identify risk factors for the onset of oral mucositis/stomatitis and OSE to identify high-risk patients who will be taking Dato-DXd. Understanding these risk factors in patients receiving standard-of-care anti-cancer therapies may also help with mitigation strategies. This objective will be achieved by identifying and describing patient demographics and clinical characteristics of cases with oral mucositis/stomatitis and OSE. No study drug will be provided or administered for this study.
