Efficacy & Safety of Prophylaxis With Bemiparin in Cancer Patients With a Central Venous Catheter (BECAT)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the subcutaneous administration for 45 days of Bemiparin (3,500 UI/day) in cancer patients with a CVC, to prevent CVC-related deep venous thrombosis (CVC-DVT)
Cancer|Thrombosis
DRUG: Bemiparin|DRUG: Placebo
Clinical or symptomatic CVC-DVT verified objectively (Doppler ultrasonography or phlebography).|Subclinical or asymptomatic CVC-DVT confirmed by elective bilateral Doppler ultrasonography performed 45±5 days after randomization.
Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common complication in patients with cancer principally in association with central vein catheters (CVC). The clinical benefit of antithrombotic prophylaxis for CVC-related VTE in cancer patients remains unclear.The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the administration of Bemiparin in cancer patients with a central venous catheter (CVC). This study is designed as a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. On the day of CVC insertion, eligible patients are randomly assigned to receive subcutaneously either bemiparin (3,500 UI/day) or placebo by using preloaded syringes for 45 days.

The primary efficacy endpoint will be the combined incidence during the double blind treatment period of Clinical or symptomatic CVC-DVT verified objectively (Doppler ultrasonography or phlebography)and subclinical or asymptomatic CVC-DVT confirmed by elective bilateral Doppler ultrasonography performed 45±5 days after randomization.
