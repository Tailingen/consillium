Preoperative or Postoperative Therapy of Patients With Stages IB, II, IIIA Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
In this phase II study, we plan to evaluate several novel components of therapy. In patients with potentially resectable stages IIB (T3N0) and IIIA we will compare weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin with concomitant radiation therapy versus weekly paclitaxel and every 4 week carboplatin in the preoperative (neoadjuvant) setting. For patients with potentially resectable stage IB, IIA and IIB (T2N1) tumors, weekly paclitaxel and every 4 week carboplatin will be given pre-operatively (neoadjuvant). The feasibility of resection will be evaluated in the neoadjuvant group of patients. The continued study of concurrent radiation therapy with weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin will be evaluated in those patients with stage IIB (T3N0) and IIIA disease who initially had resection (adjuvant setting). Lastly, weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin every 4 weeks will be evaluated as an adjuvant program in patients who had completely resected stage IB, IIA and IIB (T2N1).

Upon determination of eligibility, neo-adjuvant patients will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms:

* ARM A Paclitaxel + Carboplatin + Radiation Therapy + Surgery
* ARM B Paclitaxel + Carboplatin + Surgery

After surgery neo-adjuvant patients with a complete resection will either receive Paclitaxel + Carboplatin or no therapy, depending on their stage of disease at time of enrollment. Patients with incomplete resection Paclitaxel + Carboplatin + Radiation Therapy. Adjuvant patients who enter the study after complete resection will receive Paclitaxel + Carboplatin with or without Radiation Therapy based on initial stage of disease.
