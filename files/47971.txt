INTERVENTION WITH TRANEXAMIC ACID TO REDUCE HAEMORRHAGE DURING LAPAROSCOPIC MYOMECTOMY
This research is planned as a randomised double-blind controlled trial. interventions to reduce haemorrhage during laparoscopic myomectomy for fiboids is important. Ä°ntraoperative Tranexamic acid usage can reduce haemorrhage and related symptoms when given during laparoscopic myomectomy. There is no randomised controlled trials in literature about tranexamic acid usage in laparoscopic gynecological operations.
Uterine Fibroid|Myoma;Uterus|Tranexamic Acid Adverse Reaction
DRUG: Tranexamic Acid 100 MG/ML|DRUG: Placebos
amount of bleeding during operation, total amount of bleeding during surgery, 0 minute - 180 minute|operation duration time, time between initial and end of the surgery, 0 minute - 180 minute
researchers planned this trial by firstly randomising the patients. 1 gr tranexamic acid in 100 ml salin will bi given by initial of the anesthesia of the patient, the other group will be taken only 100ml saline solution. Randomising will be double blind and only anesthesiologist will see if the paient is in working group or control group. Than researchers provide laparoscopic myomectomy with same prothocol to each patient. At the end of the operation, researchers will record all the parameters during operation like; operation starting and ending time, the amount of bleeding, time of suturing, the size, location and count of myoma uteri, complications, weight of myoma uteri and the change of haemoglobine levels before and after operation.
