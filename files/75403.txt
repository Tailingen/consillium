A Study of Decitabine Given Subcutaneously to Adults With Low or Intermediate-1 Risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS)
The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness and safety of two different dose schedules of DACOGEN® (decitabine) for Injection in patients with Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS).
Myelodysplastic Syndrome
DRUG: decitabine|DRUG: decitabine
The Overall Improvement Rate, Defined as proportion of patients having complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR), marrow complete remission (mCR), or hematologic improvement.

Based on Modified International Working Group Response Criteria for Altering Natural History of Myelodysplastic Syndromes.

Complete Remission: Bone marrow: ≤ 5% myeloblasts with normal maturation of all cell lines. Persistent dysplasia will be noted. Peripheral blood Hgb ≥ 11 g/dL; Platelets ≥ 100 X 109/L; Neutrophils ≥ 1.0 X 109/Lb; Blasts 0%.

Partial Remission: All CR criteria if abnormal before treatment except: Bone marrow blasts decreased by ≥ 50% over pretreatment but still \> 5%.

Marrow Complete Remission: Bone marrow: ≤ 5% myeloblasts and decrease by ≥ 50% over pretreatment. Peripheral blood: if hematological improvement responses, they will be noted in addition to marrow CR.

HI Improvement: shown in increases in hemoglobin, platelet and neutrophil response., Up to one year
This is a randomized open-label Phase 2 efficacy and safety study of two (2) subcutaneous (SQ) dosing schedules of decitabine in subjects with Low or Intermediate 1 Risk MDS. This study will be conducted in up to 6 study centers in the United States.

The primary efficacy outcome is the overall improvement rate. These two doses will be administered subcutaneously. The probability that one schedule is superior to the other will be estimated, and the level of toxicity for each schedule will also be evaluated.
