Improving Clinical Staging for Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer Through Molecular Profiling and Improved Imaging
The goal of this research study is to improve detection of cancer outside of the bladder through genetic testing and improved imaging.
Bladder Cancer
PROCEDURE: Tissue Biopsy|PROCEDURE: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
Detection Improvement of Cancer Outside of the Bladder, Improved cross sectional imaging with pelvic MRI, and biopsy specimen molecular profiling used to identify muscle invasive bladder cancer (noc-MIBC). Analysis to determine biologic subtypes which will then be correlated with final pathology, identifying the subtype(s) associated with noc-MIBC., 4 weeks
If participant agrees to take part in the study, a piece of the tumor that is removed during the biopsy will be collected for research purposes. The tissue will be sent to the laboratory for genetic testing.

If they have had a computed tomography scan (CT scan) or magnetic resonance imaging scan (MRI) recently, information collected from the scan will be collected. If they have not had one recently, they will have an MRI with contrast as part of this study. They will receive a separate consent form for this MRI scan.

The results of the test will be given to their doctor, but the results will not be used to decide their treatment.

After they have surgery, information will be collected from their medical records, such as their diagnosis.

Length of Study:

* Their participation on this study will be over once their surgery is completed.
* This is an investigational study.

Up to 100 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
