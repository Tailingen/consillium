Radiation Dose Intensification With Accelerated Hypofractionated Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy and Concurrent Carboplatin and Paclitaxel for Inoperable Esophageal Cancer
Rates of local disease control in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer who are not candidates for surgical resection are suboptimal. Despite treatment with chemotherapy and radiation therapy approximately half of patients will develop recurrence of their cancer at the site of the original primary cancer. Salvage therapy options are largely ineffective and nearly all patients who develop local disease recurrence will succumb to their cancer. Recent clinical trials for lung cancer have demonstrated that local tumor control can be improved safely with accelerated hypofractionated radiation therapy regimens in order to achieve radiation dose intensification. This clinical trial aims to adapt those techniques and assess the safety of such a regimen for the treatment of inoperable thoracic esophageal cancers.
Esophagus Cancer|Esophageal Cancer|Cancer of the Esophagus
RADIATION: Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy|DRUG: Carboplatin|OTHER: MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI)-Plus module|OTHER: EuroQol (EQ-5D)|OTHER: SF-12|OTHER: MOS Social Support Measure|OTHER: CES-D|PROCEDURE: Blood for ctDNA (optional)|PROCEDURE: Blood for SCCA|DRUG: Paclitaxel
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of hypofractionated IMRT with chemotherapy, The MTD of the combination of radiation and FOLFOX will be estimated using the proposed TITE-CRM model. After the phase I study, the MTD will be chosen as the dose that yields a posterior toxicity estimate closest to 20% while being between 15% and 25%. Toxicity will be coded using CTCAE v5.0., Through 6 month follow-up for all enrolled patients (estimated to be 65 months)
Median local relapse-free survival, -The length of time after treatment ends that the participants survives without any signs or symptoms of the cancer recurring within the radiated field, 24 months|Median overall survival, -The length of time from the start of treatment that participants are still alive, 24 months|Median progression-free survival, -The length of time from the start of treatment to progression or death from any cause, 24 months|Patient reported outcomes as measured by the MDASI-Plus, * The MDASI-plus is a reliable, validated tool for assessing cancer-related symptoms regardless of therapy or specific cancer diagnosis. Patients are asked to fill out a twenty-seven question inventory, ranking their symptoms on a 0 (no problems) to 10 (worst imaginable) scale
* The mean of the scores will be calculated at each time point and compared to other time points to assess changes in cancer-related symptoms, From baseline through 12 months post end of treatment|Patient reported outcomes as measured by the EQ-5D, * standardized 2-part, patient-administered instrument used for direct and indirect assessment of health state utilities
* The first part asks respondents to "check the ONE box \[next to the appropriate statement\] that best describes your health TODAY" for each of 5 health dimensions, including mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The second part of the EQ-5D is a visual analogue scale (VAS) valuing current health state
* Both the 5-item index score and the VAS score are transformed into a utility score between 0 "Worst health state" and 1 "Best health state, From baseline through 12 months post end of treatment|Patient reported outcomes as measured by the SF-12, * 12-item questionnaire measuring physical and mental functional status
* Mental and physical component scores will be calculated in addition to calculating the measure's eight individual subscales (physical functioning, social functioning, role limitations due to physical problems, body pain, general health, role limitations due to emotional problems general health, vitality, and mental health). Higher scores indicate better quality of life, From baseline through 12 months post end of treatment|Patient reported outcomes as measured by the MOS Social Support, -19 items

-. Response choices range from "none of the time" (1) to "all of the time" (5). A mean social support score for all 19 items is computed with higher scores indicating a greater availability of social support., From baseline through 12 months post end of treatment|Patient reported outcomes as measured by the 4-Item CES-D, * 4 item screening version to evaluate depressive symptoms
* The mean of the scores will be calculated at each time point and compared to other time points to assess changes in depression symptoms, From baseline through 12 months post end of treatment|Number and type of adverse events experienced by patient, 12 months
