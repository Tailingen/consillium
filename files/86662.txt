Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Metastatic Solid Tumors
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy with pemetrexed disodium and irinotecan in treating patients who have metastatic solid tumors.
Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific
DRUG: irinotecan hydrochloride|DRUG: pemetrexed disodium
OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of LY231514 followed by irinotecan in patients with metastatic cancer. II. Determine the quantitative and qualitative toxicity of LY231514 in combination with irinotecan in these patients. III. Assess plasma pharmacokinetics in these patients treated with this regimen. IV. Document any antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive LY231514 IV over 10 minutes followed by irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression and unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients each receive escalating doses of LY231514 and irinotecan. If escalation of one drug in the combination results in unacceptable dose limiting toxicity (DLT), the drug is not escalated further. Instead, the dose of that drug is decreased to its safe dose, and the second drug is escalated until unacceptable DLT results. If DLT occurs in 2 of up to 6 patients at any level, dose escalation is stopped. The maximum tolerated dose is defined as the highest dose at which fewer than 2 of 6 patients experience DLT during courses 1 or 2.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 42 patients will be accrued for this study.
