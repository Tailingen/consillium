Prevention of Metabolic Syndrome and Increased Weight Using Metformin Concurrent to Androgen Deprivation Therapy and Radiotherapy for Locally Advanced Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate
In current clinical practice, an acceptable standard treatment for locally advanced prostate cancer is radiation therapy in combination with hormone therapy (called Treatment B or Group B in this study). However, despite our best treatments, there is a risk that the prostate cancer may eventually return. As well, the hormonal therapy that is given to treat the prostate cancer is known to cause some harmful effects, with some patients using the hormones gaining weight, developing diabetes, having increased cholesterol levels, having increased blood pressure, and/or heart problems.

This study is looking at whether Metformin, a drug that is commonly used to treat diabetes, can prevent patients from developing some of the harmful effects of the hormonal therapy. In treating diabetes, Metformin is known to decrease patients' sugar levels and also prevents patients from gaining weight, decreases their cholesterol levels, decreases the number of heart problems and allows patients to live longer. As a result, the researchers in this study are hopeful that Metformin will also be beneficial for men with prostate cancer on hormonal therapy by preventing them from developing these problems.
Prostatic Neoplasm
DRUG: Metformin|DRUG: Placebo
Mean body weight at 12 months of follow-up, 12 months of follow-up
Prevalence and incidence of Metabolic Syndrome, At 6, 12, 24 and 36 months follow-up
This study will examine the role of Metformin as a means to prevent increases in weight as well as the prevalence and severity of metabolic syndrome, with their associated morbidity, amongst men with locally advanced, biopsy confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate (PCa) that are planned to receive curative intent therapy with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) to the prostate.

Males of any age with biopsy confirmed high tier intermediate risk PCa (Gleason score 7 and PSA 10-20) or high risk PCa (any T3; and/or Gleason Score ≥ 8.0; and/or PSA ≥ 20 ng/mL) ECOG 0 to 1, non-diabetic with no evidence of metastatic PCa will be randomized to either:

Group A: Metformin 500mg PO TID x 30-36 months total, with neoadjuvant and adjuvant ADT x18-36 months and EBRT of 46 Gy/23# to pelvic lymph nodes (optional); plus prostate boost to 78 Gy/39# or brachytherapy boost (110-115 Gy) or hypofractionated equivalent

OR

Group B: Identical placebo TID x 20-36 months total, with neoadjuvant and adjuvant ADT x18-36 months and EBRT of 46 Gy/23# to pelvic lymph nodes (optional); plus prostate boost to 78 Gy/39# or brachytherapy boost (110-115 Gy) or hypofractionated equivalent

A planned sample size of 104 patients will provide 97% power for a 2-tailed α of 0.05 to detect 4 kg difference in weight at 12 months of follow-up.
