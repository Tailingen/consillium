PH2 Trial in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) With a Combination of Bendamustine & Ofatumumab
Investigational Drugs:

Ofatumumab (Azerra) + bendamustine (Trenda)

Route of Administration:

Intravenous (IV)

Hypothesis:

This study is designed to assess the toxicity and overall response rate. Ofatumumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody (A type of protein made in the laboratory that can bind to substances in the body, including tumor cells) that shows promising activity in the treatment of CLL as a single agent. It is thought that by combining it with Bendamustine, an FDA approved treatment for CLL, the effect on CLL will be greater than if Ofatumumab is given alone. Ofatumumab is FDA approved for the treatment of relapsed/refractory CLL.

Participation:

Approximately 37 relapsed/refractory CLL subjects will participate in this study over two years.

Treatment Plan:

A maximum of 6 cycles of treatment will be allowed. During day 1 of cycle 1 ofatumumab IV 300mg will be administered. On day 1 of all cycles ofatumumab treatment will be followed by bendamustine IV 90mg/m2. On day 2 of all cycles, bendamustine IV 90mg/m2 will be administered. On day 3 of all cycles, neulasta SQ 6mg will be given. On day 8 of cycle 1 only patients will receive ofatumumab IV 1000mg. During cycles 2 through 6 ofatumumab 1000mg will be given on day 1 only.

Follow-up:

Patients will be followed monthly for six months, then every three months for five years then annually thereafter.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)
DRUG: ofatumumab + bendamustine
Overall Response Rate/ Efficacy, The primary objective for this trial is to evaluate the overall response rate (CR+PR) of bendamustine and ofatumumab in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL.
Safety Evaluation, The first secondary objective is to evaluate the toxicity of patients with relapsed/refractory CLL treated with bendamustine and ofatumumab.|Response Rate, Other secondary objectives include: evaluating the complete response rate, progression-free survivial, overal survival and time to next therapy|Correlative Analysis, This study also aims to determine whether expression of of ZAP-70, CD38, IgVH status, and chromosomes, correlate with response rate, duration of response, and survival
