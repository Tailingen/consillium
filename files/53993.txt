131 I-MIBG in Treating Patients With Refractory or Relapsed Neuroblastoma
RATIONALE: Radioactive drugs, such as 131 I-MIBG, may carry radiation directly to tumor cells and not harm normal cells.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well 131 I-MIBG works in treating patients with refractory or relapsed neuroblastoma.
Neuroblastoma
BIOLOGICAL: filgrastim|RADIATION: iobenguane I 131
Ability of iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine to provide palliative therapy|Acute and late toxicities
Disease and symptom responses
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine if iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine can provide palliative therapy for patients with refractory or relapsed neuroblastoma.
* Determine the acute and late toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

Secondary

* Determine disease and symptom responses of patients treated with this regimen.

OUTLINE: This is a compassionate use study.

Patients receive iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine IV over 2 hours. Beginning 10 days later, patients with low neutrophil counts receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously until blood count recovers. Patients with stable or responding disease may receive a second dose of iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine at least 6 weeks after the first dose.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
