to evaluate188Re-BMEDA-liposome in Patient With Primary Solid Tumor in Advanced or Metastatic Stage
This is a study to determine the maximum tolerance dose (MTD) and to evaluate the safety of 188Re-BMEDA-liposome in patient with primary solid tumor in advanced or metastatic stage.
Tumors
RADIATION: 188Re-BMEDA-liposome
Determine the MTD, The design will use cohort of 3 patients. If none of the first 3 patients experience DLT, then dose escalation will proceed for the next dose level of patients unless the present dose level is level 6 (1.47Â±0.15 mCi/kg)., up to 30 days per cohort
change in vital signs and pysical examination, assess the safety issue from the change in vital signs (BP, PR, RR and temperature) and physical examinations, from day 0 to up t0 60 days per cohort|change in lab data, assess the safety issue from the change in lab data including heatology lab data change, Biochemistry laboratory data change and urinalysis data change, from day 0 to up t0 60 days per cohort|Adverse event(s), assessed by NCI CTCAE (National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) v4.03, from day 0 to up t0 60 days per cohort|Serious Adverse event(s), All AE(s) and SAE(s) which occurred within follow-up visit after the single dose administration of study drug should be followed until resolution or the event is considered stable., from day 0 to up t0 60 days per cohort|Change in EKG, Patient will be examined the EKG by standard 12-lead at screen visit for eligibility. After enrollment, patient will be attached on a 24h-portable EKG monitor to monitoring EKG before and post-administration of Stage I and II low dose and therapeutic infusion dose for 24hrs, in 24hrs
Rhenium-188 is an ideal radionuclide for therapeutic use due to its maximum beta emission of 2.12MeV, short physical half-life of 16.9 hours, and its 155-keV gamma emission for imaging purposes. 188Re-BMEDA-liposome consists of 2 separate components (Rhenium-188 and liposome) and BMEDA as a linker. This study aims to find the MTD, evaluate the safety, efficacy profiles and investigate the biodistribution, radioactivity and radiation dosimetry of 188Re-BMEDA-liposome on primary solid tumor in metastatic stage patient by a single intravenous injection course.
