Study for Validation of Target Therapy in Multiple Myeloma Cells From Patients With miRNAs Released From B Cells, and Study of the Bone Marrow Tumor Microenvironment (Microenvironment of MM)
Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a hematologic cancer caused by the selective clonal expansion of plasma cells. By acting on the microenvironment of the bone marrow, MM shifts the niche balance and becomes chemoresistant due to its interaction with stromal cells. Despite new therapeutic strategies, MM still remains incurable and new strategies are urgently needed. In order to successfully act on MM, we must use a strategy that reflects its plasticity and blocks it on several targets: proliferation, interaction with the microenvironment, and metastasis.

The main interest of the project is to evaluate the effect of gene therapy identified in vitro, directly on patient-derived samples, in particular to translate the knowledge gained on myeloma cell lines in vitro to primary tumor cells taken from patients.
Multiple Myeloma
Evaluation of SOX4 and XBP1 expression in plasma cells from patient with MM, Frequencies and 95% confidence interval of SOX4 and XBP1, evaluated in plasma cells from bone biopsies and isolated from bone marrow blood of MM patients by qRT-PCR at different staging., up to 2 years
