Cabozantinib toLERANCE Study in HepatoCellular Carcinoma (CLERANCE)
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common tumor (the 8th leading cause of cancer in France) and has a poor prognosis. It is the 3rd leading cause of cancer deaths in the world. In the early stages (low tumor mass), HCC can be treated for curative purposes by surgical resection, percutaneous ablation or liver transplantation. When the tumor mass is larger (\> 3 nodules) but remains confined to the liver, the standard treatment is hepatic intra-arterial chemoembolization (TACE). In the event of failure of the latter or if the tumor dissemination progresses in the portal venous system or in the form of metastases, the systemic treatments are then indicated.

In 1st line, the reference treatment is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (ITK) Sorafenib.

Cabozantinib obtained the European and French authorization (AMM) in November 2018 for its use in case of failure of Sorafenib in patients with HCC.

The main objective is the evaluation of the safety of Cabozantinib administered to patients with intermediate HCC ineligible for chemoembolization or advanced HCC after failure of Sorafenib and possibly another systemic anticancer line.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: Cabozantinib group
survival of the patient after start of treatment, Overall Survival (OS) defined as the time (in months) between the start of treatment with Cabozantinib and the date of death from all causes; patients who are alive or lost to follow-up at the time of the analysis will be censored on the last follow-up date, Year 1
dosage modification for adverse effect, Incidence of changes in the dose of Cabozantinib for adverse effect during treatment (including daily dose reductions, dose spacings, discontinuation and permanent cessation of treatment for intolerance)., Year 1|Daily median dose of Cabozantinib, Daily median dose of Cabozantinib calculated between the start of treatment with Cabozantinib and the day of final cessation (including death), Year 1|Number of patients with each dose of Cabozantinib, calculation of the number of patients with a dose of Cabozantinib 60 mg, 40 mg or 20 mg at the end of treatment or at the end of the study., Year1
