Phase II Study of DCVAC/PCa After Primary Radiotherapy for Patients With High Risk Localized Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine whether DCVAC/PCa added after radical primary prostatectomy can improve PSA progression times within 5 years for patients with high risk localized Prostate Cancer.
