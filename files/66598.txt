Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy or Chemoradiotherapy in Resectable Oesophageal Carcinoma（NewEC Study）
To provide comprehensive efficacy and safety profiles of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT) versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) versus surgery alone in resectable oesophageal carcinoma.

Overall survival (OS), The OS was calculated as the time from the date of the histologically documented diagnosis to the date of death or the final follow-up., 5 years
Disease-free survival (DFS), DFS was calculated from the date of R0 resection to the date of disease recurrence or death from any cause, 5 years|R0 resection rate, R0 resection was defined as gross disease removed with negative margins (tumour-free resection margin)., Baseline|Pathologic complete response (pCR), pCR was defined as no evidence of residual tumour cells in the primary site and resected lymph nodes of the operative specimens., Baseline|30-day postoperative or in-hospital mortality, 30 days
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) or neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT) has been shown to be better than surgery alone in patients with resectable oesophageal carcinoma, but higher quality evidence is needed as new findings have emerged regarding this issue.Previous evidence-based findings and the current guidelines have not established a survival advantage of NCRT over NCT or an acceptable safety profile of the addition of radiotherapy to NCT; whether NCRT or NCT is more effective for the treatment of adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the oesophagus is unclear.This study aims to provide comprehensive efficacy and safety profiles of NCRT versus NCT versus surgery alone in resectable oesophageal carcinoma.
