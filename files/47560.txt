Trametinib Plus Anlotinib in Non-G12C KRAS-Mutant NSCLC Patients
This is a Phase I exploratory study. The study is divided into two parts (A/B).In part A, the primary endpoint is the determination of the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Secondary endpoint for phase Ia includes evaluating the objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), and adverse events (AEs). Following the establishment of the RP2D, the expansion cohort will be initiated.

Transitioning to part B, 20 patients will be enrolled to further evaluate the ORR. All patients will receive the trametinib plus anlotinib regimen based on the RP2D determined in part A. The primary endpoint for part B is to assess the ORR, while secondary endpoint includes evaluating PFS, overall survival (OS), DCR, AEs, and duration of overall response (DoR).

In part A, the study plans to enroll eligible patients to receive the MEK inhibitor trametinib (2 mg) in combination with anlotinib (6mg, 8 mg, 10 mg, 12 mg). The number of subjects is determined according to the actual situation of dose climbing.

In part B, another 20 eligible patients will be enrolled and treated with trametinib (2mg) + anlotinib (RP2D), until the disease progression (PD) or unacceptable toxicity occurs to further evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy.

Patients participated in safety follow-up after the first course of treatment until 3 months after discontinuation due to PD or toxicity. Dose-limiting toxicities from the first cycle were collected. Therapeutic efficacy evaluation was scheduled according to RECIST version 1.1 every 4-8 weeks. After the investigators' evaluation, the assessment cycle could extend to 12 weeks or longer due to the uncontrollable factors during the treatment period. Blood samples will be collected for pharmacokinetic analysis and biomarker discovery at baseline and at each periodic assessment.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Trametinib|DRUG: Anlotinib
Part A: Recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), The determination of RP2D relied on several priority indexes: firstly, the MTD, followed by ORR, and mean tumor shrinkage rate. If the highest dose of anlotinib (12 mg) did not reach MTD, ORR would be the main index for defining the RP2D. Subsequently, if 2 or more dosage groups had same ORR, the average tumor shrinkage rate would replace MTD and ORR in determining RP2D., 1 year|Part B: Objective response rate (ORR), Percentage of participants achieving CR and PR., 1.5 year
Progression Free Survival (PFS), The time from the start of systemic treatment date to the date of first documented disease progression (event: disease progression - DP, based on RECIST, death, adverse events, which provide to disqualification from further therapy)., 2 years|Disease control rate (DCR), Percentage of participants achieving CR and PR and SD., 2 years|Overall survival (OS), OS defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause. Participants who do not die at the end of the extended follow-up period, or were lost to follow-up during the study, were censored at the last date they were known to be alive., 2 years|Adverse Event (AE), Adverse event caused by the combination treatments., 2 years|Duration of overall response (DoR), The time from date of the first documentation of objective response (CR or PR) to the first documentation of PD or to death due to any cause in the absence of documented PD., 2 years
