Phase 1 Study of E7090 in Subjects With Solid Tumor
This is a Phase 1 study of E7090 in subjects with advanced solid tumors. This study will be conducted in 2 parts:

1. Part 1 will be the dose escalation portion of this study to determine the maximum tolerated dose in subjects with solid tumors, and
2. Part 2 will comprise cohort expansions to further characterize the safety and tolerability of E7090 and to assess preliminary efficacy of E7090 in subjects with solid tumors characterized by genetic abnormalities in FGF/FGFR pathway.
Tumors
DRUG: E7090
Safety and tolerability of E7090 as a measure of Adverse Events/ Serious Adverse Events, Upto 30 days after last administration of drug
Best Overall Response (BOR) in targeted population, Tumor assessment (target lesion, non-target lesion, and presence or absence of new lesion) will be performed based on RECIST v1.1 (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors). Tumor marker will also be measured. FDG-PET CT (fluorodeoxyglucose- Positron emission tomography computed tomography) will also be evaluated. Best overall response are complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), progression of disease (PD), and not evaluable (NE), where SD have to be achieved at \>= 7 weeks after first dose., From screening until the date of discontinuation, assessed up to 100 months.|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as a proportion of subjects with BOR of CR or PR., From screening until the date of discontinuation, assessed up to 100 months.|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the proportion of subjects who with BOR of CR, PR or SD., From screening until the date of discontinuation, assessed up to 100 months.|Progression- Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of first dose to the first documented date of event (disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first)., From the date of first dose until the first documented date of event (disease progression or death from any cause), assessed up to 100 months.|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of first dose to the date of death from any cause., From the date of first dose until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 100 months.|Maximum tolerated Dose (MTD) of E7090 (part 1) and Recommended Dose (RD) for future studies, On day 35|Plasma Cmax (maximum concentration) of E7090, On day 36|Plasma tmax (Time of maximum concentration) of E7090, On day 36|Plasma AUC (Area under the concentration vs time curve) of E7090, On day 36|Pharmacokinetics (PK) of Urine (renal clearance), On day 36
