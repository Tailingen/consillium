The Safety and Efficay Investigation of CAR-T Cell Therapy for Patients with Hematological Malignancies
To evaluate the tolerability and safety of CAR-T technology in patients with relapsed or refractory hematolymphoid malignancies.
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia|Lymphoma|Multiple Myeloma
BIOLOGICAL: CAR-T Autologous T cell injection
Safety: Incidence and severity of adverse events, To evaluate the possible adverse events occurred within first one month after CAR-T infusion, including the incidence and severity of symptoms such as cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity, First 1 month post CAR-T cells infusion|Efficacy: Remission Rate, Complete remission (CR) Complete remission with incomplete recovery of blood cells (CRI), positive minimal residual tumor (MRD+) or negative tumor (MRD -) CR/CRI, disease recurrence or progression (PD) were evaluated, and the overall remission rate was ORR=CR+CRI; For drenching Complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR), disease stability (SD) Disease recurrence or progression (PD) was evaluated, and the overall remission rate was ORR=CR+PR; For multiple myeloma Complete remission (CR), partial remission (VGPR, PR), disease stability (SD), disease recurrence or progression (PD) were adopted, Overall remission rate ORR=CR+VGPR+PR;, 3 months post CAR-T cells infusion
progression-free survival (PFS), progression-free survival (PFS) time, 24 months post CAR-T cells infusion|CAR-T proliferation, the copy number of Senl CAR- T cells in the genomes of PBMC by qPCR method, 3 months post CAR-T cells infusion|Cytokine release, Cytokine( IL-6,IL-10,IFN-γ,TNF-α ) concentration (pg/mL) by flow cytometry method, 1 month post CAR-T cells infusion
Main research purposes:

To evaluate the tolerability and safety of CAR-T technology in patients with relapsed or refractory hematolymphoid malignancies.

Secondary research purposes:

Objective Evaluation of Cytodynamic Characteristics of CAR-T in Different Types of Hematological Malignancies
