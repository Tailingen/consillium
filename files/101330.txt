Efficacy of Monosialotetrahexosylganglioside in the Prophylactic Treatment of Bortezomib-induced Peripheral Neuropathy
Bortezomib was an important drug in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM),and peripheral neuropathy (PN) is a significant dose-limiting toxicity of bortezomib that typically occurs within the first courses of bortezomib, reaches a plateau at cycle 5. Up to now, no effective prophylaxis have been developed for PN. Monosialotetrahexosylganglioside, a nerve-protecting drug,was often used to promote growth of nerve, and function restoration of damaged nerve.Thus,the investigators hypothesized that combination of Monosialotetrahexosylganglioside and bortezomib can reduce the incidence rate of peripheral neuropathy (PN) and promote the relief of peripheral neuropathy (PN) in multiple myeloma (MM) patients.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Monosialotetrahexosylganglioside
overall incidence rate of peripheral neuropathy (PN), the grade of peripheral neuropathy (PN) was recorded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v3.0., up to 6 months
duration of peripheral neuropathy (PN), the duration of peripheral neuropathy means the time from the onset time of peripheral neuropathy (PN) to the relief time of PN, up to 1 year (about 6 months after the completion of treatment)|complete rate (CR) rate, The criteria for CR was according to International Myeloma Working Group Uniform Response Criteria, up to 6 months
