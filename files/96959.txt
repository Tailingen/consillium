Red Blood Cell - IMProving trAnsfusions for Chronically Transfused Recipients
Red Blood Cell - IMProving trAnsfusions for Chronically Transfused recipients (RBC-IMPACT) is an observational cohort study to assess donor, component, and recipient factors that contribute to RBC efficacy in chronically and episodically transfused patients. The objective of the study is to determine how specific genetic and non-genetic factors in donors and recipients may impact RBC survival after transfusion - in short, what factors on both the donor and recipient side may improve the efficacy of the transfusion.
Sickle Cell Disease|Thalassemia|Pediatric Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Red Blood Cell (RBC) Transfusion
Change in Hemoglobin A or Hemoglobin Level per day (RBC Survival), Change in hemoglobin A or hemoglobin level per day in between subsequent transfusion episodes, for sickle cell disease and thalassemia cohorts, respectively, Baseline (immediately pre-) to post-transfusion over 2 years|Change in Serum Iron Level, For all groups participating, change in serum iron measured from immediately prior to 2 hours post-transfusion, Baseline (immediately before) and 2-hours after transfusion
Hemoglobin Increment, Hemoglobin increment \[defined as Hb/HbA(post-transfusion)visit(i) - Hb/HbA(pre-transfusion)visit(i)\] is associated with "RBC survival", Baseline (immediately pre-) to post-transfusion, over 2 years|Hemolysis Parameter Increment, Includes serum iron, indirect bilirubin, or plasma free hemoglobin, Baseline (immediately pre-) to post-transfusion or 2-hours post-transfusion, over 2 years|Hepcidin Level, Hepcidin level at time of transfusion is a predictor of change in iron parameters (i.e., transferrin saturation, serum iron) following transfusion, Baseline (immediately before) to 2 hours after transfusion|Non-Transferrin-Bound Iron (NTBI) Level, NTBI levels in patients with pediatric oncologic diagnoses with aplasia are elevated at baseline and increase following transfusion, Baseline (immediately before) to 2 hours after transfusion|Number of Clinical Complications, Increased NTBI, serum iron, or transferrin saturation following transfusion is associated with increased risk of clinical adverse effects (i.e., new infections, SCD complications), 2 years
Rate of Alloimmunization, Rate of new alloantibody formation, 2 years|4-hydroxynonenal [4-HNE], Recipient oxidative stress pre-transfusion is associated with "RBC survival", 2 years|Type I interferon (i.e., MxA protein assay) and other cytokines (i.e., IL-6, MCP-1, IFNgamma), Recipient inflammation pre-transfusion is associated with "RBC survival", 2 years|Number of Transfusion Reactions, Transfusion reactions are associated with "RBC survival", 2 years
Sickle cell disease (SCD) and thalassemia are genetic disorders inducing anemia of differing pathophysiology. A primary therapy for preventing certain SCD complications (e.g., stroke) and for thalassemia major is regular red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, coupled with iron chelation to prevent the complications of transfusion-induced iron overload. For patients with pediatric hematology-oncology diagnoses with chemotherapy-induced aplasia, RBC transfusion is also common, but the degree of transfusion-induced iron overload and its implications for these patients is incompletely understood. Because iron-related tissue toxicity is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in regularly transfused patients, developing strategies to minimize iron loading and iron toxicity is a key objective of this proposal (study Aim #2), stemming from the objective to optimize RBC unit characteristics that patients with SCD and thalassemia receive beyond RBC phenotype matching for Rh C, E and K antigens (study Aim #1). The study will enroll patients with SCD, thalassemia or pediatric oncologic diagnoses receiving eligible transfusion at 6 hospital sites in the United States, as well as patients with SCD at 5 hemocenters in Brazil.
