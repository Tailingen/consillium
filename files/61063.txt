Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacogenomics of Ribociclib in Race-based Cohorts
The aim is to determine the pharmacological and biochemical association between ribociclib exposure and CYP3A variants in African American/Blacks and Non-Hispanic White patients. The investigators hypothesize that patients treated with ribociclib who are CYP3A5 poor metabolizers may be exposed to higher levels of ribociclib than CYP3A5 intermediate or normal metabolizers. The findings could allow clinicians to tailor treatments to maintain therapeutic doses while limiting toxicities.

Ribociclib Area-under-the-curve (AUC), Compare the exposure (i.e., AUC) of ribociclib at steady-state between CYP3A5 poor metabolizers (PM) and CYP3A5 intermediate or normal metabolizers (IM/NM) in each independent race-based cohort of women with advance breast cancer, On day 8-16 of cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)
Ribociclib Pharmacokinetic Properties - Maximum Concentration (Cmax), Maximum concentration (Cmax) at steady state between different CYP3A5 phenotypes, On day 8-16 of cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Ribociclib Pharmacokinetic Properties - the Time to Reach Cmax (Tmax), the time to reach Cmax (Tmax) at steady state between different CYP3A5 phenotypes, On day 8-16 of cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Ribociclib Pharmacokinetic Properties - Clearance, clearance at steady state between different CYP3A5 phenotypes, On day 8-16 of cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Ribociclib Pharmacokinetic Properties - Volume of Distribution(vd), Volume of distribution(vd) at steady state between different CYP3A5 phenotypes, days 8-16 of cycle 1 (28 day cycle)|Ribociclib Pharmacokinetic Properties - Elimination Half-life, Elimination half-life (t1/2) at steady state between different CYP3A5 phenotypes, On day 8-16 of cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Change in QTc Interval, Change in QTc interval between 1) baseline and between days 8-16 of cycle 1 (midcycle), and 2) baseline and scheduled visit prior to initiation of cycle 2 (C2), between different CYP3A5 phenotypes., Baseline, day 8-16 of cycle 1 and prior to cycle 2 (each cycle is 28 days)|Laboratory Abnormalities - Neutropenia, Occurrence of neutropenia, from baseilne through prior to cycle 2 (each cycle is 28 days)|Laboratory Abnormalities - Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), Occurrence of Laboratory abnormalities: AST, From Baseline through prior to cycle 2 (each cycle is 28 days)|Laboratory Abnormalities -Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT), Occurrence of Laboratory abnormalities: ALT between between different CYP3A5 phenotypes., From Baseline to prior to cycle 2 (each cycle is 28 days)
This prospective, multicenter, cohort study will assess ribociclib (600 mg PO daily) pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenomics in female patients with HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer. This design will be used for two independent, race-based cohorts: 18 African American/Black patients and 18 Non-Hispanic White patients. Women are eligible if they are older than 18, have HR+/HER2- mBC and are candidates for treatment with a CDK 4/6 inhibitor and endocrine therapy. Patients are ineligible if currently prescribed a medication that inhibits or induces the CYP3A isoenzymes, have baseline electrocardiogram abnormalities, or are otherwise considered to be ineligible for ribociclib. Participants will provide serial blood samples during the first cycle (collected immediately prior to the ribociclib dose, and 0.5hr ± 5min, 1hr ± 5min, 2hr ± 15min, 4hr ± 15min, 6hr ± 15min after the daily dose of ribociclib). Plasma samples will be analyzed via mass spectrometry to characterize the pharmacokinetics (e.g., AUC0-24, Cmax). Pharmacogenetic testing will be performed using the PharmacoScanTM microarray, which tests 4,627 markers in 1,191 genes, including variants in CYP3A4 and CYP3A5.
