Study on Neutropenia Induced by Adjuvant Paclitaxel/Carboplatin Chemotherapy in Patients With Epithelial Ovarian Cancer
To develop a robust prediction model to predict the occurrence of grade 3-4 neutropenia induced by adjuvant paclitaxel/carboplatin chemotherapy in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer and to validate this model.
