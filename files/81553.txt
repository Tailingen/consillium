Children with hematologic malignancies or solid tumors are all facing with immune deficiency due to the disease, the chemotherapy, the hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or the splenectomy, which greatly increases their chance to get infectious diseases. In this study, we will assess the compliance of children with hematologic malignancies or solid tumors and their parents to accept vaccination after finishing treatments, follow up with untoward effect questionnaires to assess the safety, obtain the serum of children patients to test antibody titers and assess the effectivity, provide clues for the study of vaccination in children with hematologic malignancies or solid tumors and provide a scientific basis for the formulation and reunification of vaccination programs.
