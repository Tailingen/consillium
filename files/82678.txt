A Pilot Study of Ciprofloxacin Plus Gemcitabine and Nab-Paclitaxel Chemotherapy in Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.
This is a single-center, pilot study evaluating the addition of Ciprofloxacin (study drug) to standard-of-care gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel chemotherapy in treatment-naïve metastatic PDAC patients. Patients who are recommended gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel chemotherapy as a standard-of-care by their treating physician will be offered to participate in this study.
