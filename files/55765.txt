Efficacy Study of Dendritic Cell Vaccination in Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia in Remission
The primary aim of this innovative immunotherapeutic study is to determine whether the antileukemic effects seen in our previous phase I/II study can be confirmed in a large cohort of patients and whether dendritic cell vaccination can significantly prevent relapse and increase survival of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients by eradicating minimal residual disease.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: DC vaccine
Overall survival, The primary objective of this randomized phase II clinical study is to determine the effect of WT1-targeted dendritic cell vaccination on overall survival in adult AML patients at very high risk of relapse and in complete remission., At study completion, an average of 5 year
Relapse rate, to determine the effect of WT1-targeted dendritic cell vaccination on relapse rate in adult AML patients at very high risk of relapse and in complete remission., At study completion, an average of 5 year|relapse-free survival, to determine the effect of WT1-targeted dendritic cell vaccination on relapse-free survival in adult AML patients at very high risk of relapse and in complete remission., At study completion, an average of 5 year|Change in WT1 mRNA levels in peripheral blood, Efficacy assessment will also be performed on a molecular level. To this end, peripheral blood samples will be obtained from participants in both study groups (vaccine group and control group) and analyzed by qRT-PCR for WT1 expression, which is a promising molecular biomarker in AML., Through study completion, at every vaccination during 2 years|Immune activation, This study aims to examine the presence of leukemia-specific immune responses in AML patients in remission and to investigate whether they can be induced or increased in these patients by WT1 mRNA-electroporated DC vaccination., After the 4th DC vaccine|General and disease-specific quality of life, Patients will be asked to fill out general and disease-specific quality of life questionnaires to assess changes in general and disease-specific quality of life during the study at regular time points, At study completion, an average of 5 year
Tertiary: Safety, To corroborate the safety of WT1 mRNA-electroporated DC vaccination in adult patients with AML. Safety will be assessed at every visit by adverse event reporting and clinical laboratory tests., At study completion, an average of 5 year|Exploratory: Effect of low-intensity chemotherapy, To evaluate the effect of low-intensity chemotherapy on the primary and secondary objectives., At study completion, an average of 5 year
Together with the Transplant Committee of the Belgian Hematological Society (BHS), we will perform a multicenter randomized open-label phase II clinical study in 130 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Adult patients (\> 18 years) with AML who have entered morphological CR or CRi after (1) intensive chemotherapy (i.e (i) at least one cycle of induction and one cycle of consolidation chemotherapy or (ii) one to two cycles of CPX-351 induction treatment and up to two cycles of CPX-351 consolidation treatment) or (2) low-intensity chemotherapy (i.e (iii) at least two cycles to maximum six cycles of hypomethylating agents whether or not combined with venetoclax or (iv) at least two cycles to maximum six cycles of low-dose cytarabine combined with venetoclax); and fulfilling all other eligibility criteria will be randomized to be vaccinated with dendritic cells or to receive regular follow-up care. After randomization, patients receiving low-intensity chemotherapy are allowed to continue this treatment in combination with DC vaccination or the follow-up care. The primary aim of this innovative immunotherapeutic study is to determine whether the antileukemic effects seen in our previous phase I/II study can be confirmed in a large cohort of patients and whether dendritic cell vaccination can significantly prevent relapse and increase survival of AML patients by eradicating minimal residual disease. Patients will be recruited at 8 different centers in Belgium. Recruitment will start in the second half of 2013 and will last for 10 years or until 130 efficacy-evaluable AML patients are included. In the interventional group, 65 patients will be treated during two years with autologous dendritic cells loaded by messenger RNA electroporation with the Wilms' tumor antigen (WT1). The dendritic cell therapy product will be generated and generally administered in the coordinating center, which is the Antwerp University Hospital, more specifically the Center for Cell Therapy and Regenerative Medicine (CCRG) and the Division of Hematology, both headed by Prof. Zwi Berneman. After inclusion of 130 efficacy-evaluable patients, relapse rate, relapse-free survival and overall survival analysis will be performed. Tumor marker levels and immune activation will also be monitored to compare the 2 groups at a molecular and immunological level. General and disease-specific quality of life will be evaluated using quality of life questionnaires at regular time points.
