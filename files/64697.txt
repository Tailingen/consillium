Despite the impressive cancer preventing potential of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines, HPV vaccine coverage rates in the United States remain substantially lower than other vaccines and Healthy People 2020 targets. HPV vaccine initiation can be improved through targeted reminders that motivate parents. Our long-term goal is to maximize HPV vaccination rates among girls and boys within the United States using efficient and sustainable strategies. The objective of this protocol is to evaluate the usefulness of a tiered strategy of a parent-targeted strategies in improving care seeking and receptiveness to vaccine recommendations. Strategies include HPV vaccine reminders via postcard or text message and phone-based Motivational Interview sessions. The central hypothesis is addressing key health beliefs (e.g., perceived benefits and barriers) will increase parental acceptance and, thus, HPV vaccine initiation.
