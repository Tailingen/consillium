Detecting HPV DNA in Anal and Cervical Cancers
This is a research study for individuals who have cancer associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) and are being treated with radiation as part of standard care for their cancer. Doctors leading this study will use blood tests to find out if they can detect the HPV virus in the blood of study participants before, during, and after radiation treatment. They will also collect blood and archival tumor tissue (from a previous biopsy) to perform other tests in the future that could provide more information about HPV-associated cancers and how they respond to treatment. Participation in this study will last approximately 2 years.

Rate of Participants With Detectable Circulating HPV DNA in Blood/Tumor Samples, The rate of participants who have detectable HPV DNA in their blood and tumor samples as assessed by analyzing blood/ tumor tissue samples using Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests., 25 months
Accuracy of HPV DNA Levels in Predicting Cancer Recurrence at 24 Months, The accuracy of post-treatment HPV DNA levels in predicting cancer recurrence at 24 months after treatment. This accuracy will be assessed using statistical calculations incorporating data from the participant's HPV DNA detection test results and clinical records., 24 months
