Abraxane and RT for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
For patients with stage III Lung Cancer, We propose one cycle chemotherapy using Abraxane and Carboplatin, followed by pulsed low-dose sensitizing Abraxane chemotherapy and daily Radiation. This will be followed by more hi-dose chemotherapy. We anticipate this regimen to target early distant microscopic spread by using one cycle of chemotherapy prior to radiation, and to achieve control of the disease in the lung by combining pulsed low-dose sensitizing Abraxane, with radiation.
