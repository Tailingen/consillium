Ma-Spore ALL 2020 Study
The primary objective of this trial is to improve the overall survival rate of children and young adult with B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) in Singapore and Malaysia in the context of a multicenter cooperative trial using a risk-stratified therapy.
B Lymphoblastic Leukemia
DRUG: Prednisolone|DRUG: Dexamethasone|DRUG: Vincristine|DRUG: Methotrexate|DRUG: L-Asparaginase|DRUG: Pegylated asparaginase|DRUG: Erwinase|DRUG: Dasatinib|DRUG: Imatinib|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Cytarabine|DRUG: Mercaptopurine|DRUG: Thioguanine|DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Doxorubicin|DRUG: Fludarabine
Overall survival (OS), OS is calculated from the date of diagnosis to the date of last follow-up or any death, 5 years from diagnosis
Event free survival (EFS), EFS will be calculated from the date of diagnosis of ALL to date of last follow-up or to the first event, including relapse, resistant disease, second malignancy and death, 5 years from diagnosis
Cumulative incidence (CI) of relapse for all treated cohorts, 5 years from diagnosis|Cumulative incidence (CI) of therapy-related mortality (TRM) for all treated subjects, 5 years from diagnosis
This is a multicenter open-label phase II study involving children and young adult (\< 41 years old) who are newly diagnosed with B-ALL and treatment naÃ¯ve. There will be 3 parallel cohorts whose risk to be stratified based upon leukemia genetics profiles and patient's treatment response:

1. Standard Risk (SR)
2. Intermediate Risk (IR)
3. High Risk (HR)

All drugs being used are commercially available chemotherapy drugs. There will be no novel chemotherapeutic agent without marketing authorization being tested in this trial.
