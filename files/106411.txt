Early Lymph Node Metastasis in T1/2 Stage Colorectal Cancer: Molecular and Clinical Insights
The prognostic implications of lymph node metastasis in colorectal cancer patients at an early stage, specifically T1/2 stage, are relatively unfavorable. Therefore, understanding the clinical and molecular traits relevant to metastasis in T1/2 stage are of substantial clinical importance.
Colorectal Cancer
MSI status, (I) MSI-High (MSI-H) if two or more mononucleotide markers in tumor tissue had size variations of ≥3bp compared to normal tissue; (II) MSI-Low (MSI-L) if a single mononucleotide marker in tumor tissue exhibited a size variation of ≥3bp compared to normal tissue; (III) Microsatellite Stable (MSS) if there were no size variations of ≥3bp in mononucleotide markers in tumor tissue compared to normal tissue., through study completion, an average of 1 year

Patients were classified based on their lymph node staging, with an ancillary categorization into MSI-H and MSS subgroups. A comparative mutational study was performed among these groups, incorporating risk stratification and Receiver Operating Characteristic curve analysis, with the aim of discerning the predictability of clinical features integrated with molecular characteristics for early metastasis in T1/2 stage colorectal cancer.
