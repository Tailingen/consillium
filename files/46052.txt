Cardiac Amyloidosis Registry Study
This registry is a observational, multi-center study designed to collect data and analyze it retrospectively on patients with cardiac amyloidosis who have been evaluated and treated at major amyloid centers across the US and internationally between 1997 and 2025.
Amyloidosis, Immunoglobulin Light-chain
OTHER: Registry
Quantify disease severity at diagnosis, progression and survival in patients with cardiac amyloidosis, Clinical Outcomes: Disease severity at presentation, progression, and survival \[time frame 3 years\]. Severity and progression determined by change in NYHA Class, NT-ProBNP and troponin., 1997 - 2025|Quantify incidence of complications from cardiac amyloidosis, Determine incidence of arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation; ventricular arrhythmias) after diagnosis, renal dysfunction (rise in creatinine and development of end-stage renal disease), stroke, bleeding complications \[time frame 3 years\], 1997 - 2025
Amyloidosis is a rare, multisystem disorder in which an insoluble protein is deposited in tissues, leading to organ dysfunction. Several proteins have been identified to potentially lead to amyloid cardiomyopathy (AC). Given the rare nature of these diseases, a large, multi-center effort to describe the characteristics of these patients and their outcomes with novel treatment modalities has not been established. (TBD) academic medical centers from the US and internationally will compile demographic, hemodynamic and organ-involvement data, as well as treatment strategies for AL and TTR amyloidosis.

This registry is an observational, multi-center study designed to collect data and analyze it retrospectively on patients with cardiac amyloidosis who have been evaluated and treated at major amyloid centers across the US and internationally between 1997 and 2025. It is expected that the total patient population will be approximately 5000 patients.
