S9923 R115777 in Treating Patients With Advanced Colorectal Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of R115777 in treating patients who have recurrent or advanced colorectal cancer.
Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: R115777
Confirmed complete and partial response rate to R115777, Confirmed complete and partial response rate to R115777 in pts with measurable, disseminated colorectal cancer and no prior therapy for advanced disease., Once every 8 weeks until progression
Time to treatment failure and survival, To assess time to treatment failure and survival in this group of patients., Once every 8 weeks until progression, then once every 6 months for 2 years, then annually until 3 years from registration|Frequency & severity of toxicities, To assess the frequency and severity of toxicities associated with this treatment., Weekly for 8 weeks and then once every 4 weeks until progression
OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate to R115777 in patients with disseminated colorectal cancer who have been previously treated for advanced disease. II. Assess the time to treatment failure and survival of these patients with this treatment regimen. III. Determine the frequency and severity of toxicities of this regimen in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral R115777 twice daily on days 1-21. Treatment continues every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years and then annually thereafter.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study over 5-7 months.
