AZD6244 in Combination With Docetaxel Versus Docetaxel Alone in KRAS Mutation Positive NSCLC Patients
The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of AZD6244 in combination with docetaxel versus docetaxel alone in patients with KRAS mutation positive locally advanced or metastatic non small cell lung cancer.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: AZD6244|DRUG: docetaxel|DRUG: Placebo
Overall Survival, OS was calculated as the interval from the date of randomisation to the date of patient death (any cause). Patients who had not died at the time of the final analysis, or who withdrew consent, were censored at the last date the patient was known to be alive., At least 12 months since start of treatment.
Progression Free Survival, PFS was defined as the interval between the date of randomisation and the earlier date of objective disease progression per RECIST criteria or death due to any cause in the absence of progression. Patients who did not progress or die at the time of analysis were censored at the time of their latest evaluable objective tumour assessment. This also included patients who withdrew consent., At least 12 months after start of treatment|Objective Response Rate, ORR is defined as the ratio of proportions, patients with at least one visit response of CR or PR in AZD6244 + Docetaxel vs Placebo + Docetaxel., At least 12 months after start of treatment|Duration of Response, Duration of response is defined as the time from the date of first documented response until date of documented progression or death in the absence of disease progression, the end of response should coincide with the date of progression or death from any cause used for the PFS endpoint., At least 12 months after start of treatment|Change From Baseline in Tumour Size at 6 Week., Percentage change from baseline in tumour size at 6 week. Values calculated as tumour sizes at 6 weeks minus value at baseline., 6 weeks after first dose of treatment|Change From Baseline in Tumour Size at Week 12, Percentage change from baseline in tumour size at Week 12. Values calculated as tumour sizes at 12 weeks minus value at baseline., 12 weeks|Alive and Progression-Free at 6 Months, Percentage of patients alive and progression-free at 6 months, 6 months after first dose of treatment
The primary objective of this study was to assess the efficacy in terms of overall survival (OS) of AZD6244 in combination with docetaxel, compared with docetaxel alone, in second-line patients with KRAS mutation-positive locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Amendment 4 of the CSP altered the primary objective and outcome variable from progression-free survival (PFS) to OS, and the secondary outcome variable changed from OS to PFS.

The secondary objectives of the study were:

* To further assess the efficacy of AZD6244 in combination with docetaxel, compared with docetaxel alone, in second-line patients with KRAS mutation-positive locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC
* To assess the safety and tolerability profile of AZD6244 in combination with docetaxel
* To investigate the use of plasma and serum as a potential source of circulating free tumour DNA (cfDNA) for the analysis of KRAS mutation status
* To investigate the PK of AZD6244 and N-desmethyl AZD6244 and any other known metabolites when AZD6244 is administered in combination with docetaxel.

The exploratory objectives of the study were:

* To assess the prevalence, severity and change over time of advanced NSCLC cancer specific symptoms in patients receiving AZD6244 in combination with docetaxel and docetaxel alone
* To explore potential biomarkers in residual tumour, plasma and/or serum taken for KRAS mutational analysis which may influence development of NSCLC (and associated clinical characteristics) and/or response (optional)
* To investigate the relationship between AZD6244 and/or N-desmethyl AZD6244 and any other known metabolite plasma concentrations or exposure and clinical outcomes, efficacy, AEs, and/or safety parameters if deemed appropriate
* To collect and store deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), derived from a blood sample, for future exploratory research into genes that may influence response, eg, distribution, safety, tolerability, and efficacy of AZD6244 and/or agents used in combination and/or as comparators (optional).
