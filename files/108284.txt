Fluoroglutamine PET/CT in Imaging Patients With Malignant Tumor
This clinical trial studies positron emission tomography (PET) imaging utilizing 18F-(2S,4R)4-fluoroglutamine, a glutamic acid derivative, to image patients with malignant tumor. \[18F\]Fluoroglutamine PET may provide additional information that help diagnose and stage cancer patients.

RADIATION: 18F-(2S,4R)4-fluoroglutamine
Diagnosing and Staging ability of 4-[18F]Fluoroglutamine PET/CT in malignant cancer, Sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic accuracy of 4-\[18F\]Fluoroglutamine and 18F-FDG PET/CT will be compared using paired t-test or Krusal-Wallis test., up to three years
Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, The evaluation of the Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events starts from the day of F-Gln examination until 30 days later; Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events are evaluated according to version 4.03 CTC-AE criteria., up to 30 days after the F-Gln imaging|ASCT2 expression levels in tissue samples, Wilcoxon rank-sum or Kruskal-Wallis tests will be applied for the group comparisons of IHC staining(ASCT2), up to three years|The correlation between 18F-(2S,4R)4- glutamine PET/CT imaging and prognosis in malignant tumors, Evaluating the prognostic value of metabolic parameters and clinical indexes by using log-rank tests on univariate analysis and COX proportional hazards regression tests, up to three years
