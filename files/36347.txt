Optical Biopsy of Human Skin in Conjunction With Laser Treatment
This study is to compare the ability of optical biopsy. Research can use light enters the skin, collected, analyzed by the computer, and a picture created for the pathologist to conventional histologic examination compare with the pathologist looking at the piece of tissue through a microscope makes the diagnosis.

The Optical measurements provide quantitative optical property values that reflect changes in tissue perfusion, oxygen consumption, and cell/matrix development. Each measurement requires less than 5 minutes to execute. The measurements will be taken before and after skin treatment.This non-invasive, non-contact technique has great potential as a means to diagnose different skin problems without the need to obtain a piece of tissue from the skin.
