Phase I / II Study of Irinotecan (CPT-11) Combined With l-Leucovorin (l-LV) and 5-FU in Patients With Advanced Colorectal Cancer
We performed a phase I/II study of CPT-11/5FU/l-LV in advanced colorectal cancer, to determine the optimal dose of CPT-11 and to estimate the safety and efficacy of this regimen
Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: irinotecan|DRUG: leucovorin|DRUG: fluorouracil
objective tumor response
Response duration, time to progression, median survival time, and safety
A multicenter Open-label, single-arm, phase I/II clinical trial is conducted on patients with histological stage IV colorectal cancer given irinotecan, leucovorin plus fluorouracil. The usefulness of this regimens as 1st line therapy for colorectal cancer was evaluated by the disease-free survival rate (DFR), median survival time (MST), incidence and severity of adverse event.
