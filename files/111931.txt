This is a phase 2,open-label, multicenter, single-arm study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Sintilimab in combination with Bevacizumab and Temozolomide in subjects with recurrent glioblastoma.

A total of 30 patients will be enrolled in the study and administered Sintilimab in combination with Bevacizumab and Temozolomide. The study treatment will be continued for up to 4 cycles and Sintilimab was maintained until a progression of disease or unacceptable toxicity is confirmed.
