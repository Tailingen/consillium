A Study to Evaluate the Accuracy of a Breast Cancer Locator (BCL) in Patients With Palpable Cancers
In this study, the investigators will enroll women with palpable cancers to assess the accuracy of the Breast Cancer Locator (BCL) and the concomitant procedure as a vehicle to optimize and validate the approach in such surgical cases. This approach of adopting palpable cancer patients before initiating an evaluative trial of the BCL in non-palpable breast cancer cases ensures that the BCL does not substantially alter or modify the standard-of-care procedure.
Breast Cancer
DEVICE: Breast Cancer Locator (BCL)
The Distance Measured by Pathology From the Tumor Edge to the Center of the Ink Spots, as Marked by the Black Inked Pins., Five measurements will be made per patient and the mean difference in distance will be derived between the palpated and the co-registered supine MRI-optical scan image predicted tumor edges. The BCL will be considered accurate if all 5 measurements are \> 0 cm from the tumor edge., 30 Days
Positive Margin Rate, The positive margin rate as defined by standard pathologic evaluation of the entire specimen., 30 Days|The Distances Between the Specimen Edges as Determined by the Breast Cancer Locator and by the Supine MRI/Optical Scan/ Tracker System, Distances will be measured and descriptive statistics will be employed., 30 days|Mean Resection Specimen Volume, Volumes will be measured and descriptive statistics will be employed. The specimen volume is determined by recording the water displacement and specimen scanning., 30 days from surgery
The investigators propose to test whether the Breast Cancer Locator (BCL) accurately defines the edges of the tumor. Twenty patients with palpable invasive breast cancer will undergo preoperative supine MRI, the creation of a BCL, and breast-conserving surgery using the BCL as an adjunct to palpation-guided tumor resection. Participants will also have the tumor position on their skin localized with the supine MR/optical scan/tracker method. The primary objective is to measure the distance from the center of the spots made by the BCL to the cancer edges.
