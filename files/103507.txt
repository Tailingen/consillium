LUX-Lung 5: Afatinib Plus Weekly Paclitaxel Versus Investigator's Choice of Single Agent Chemotherapy Following Afatinib Monotherapy in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Patients Failing Erlotinib or Gefitinib
The primary objective of this randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multi-center trial is to determine the efficacy of BIBW 2992 given as an add-on to chemotherapy in patients with NSCLC Stage IIIb or IV progressing after BIBW 2992 monotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone in this patient population. Patients on both treatment arms will receive best supportive care in addition to study treatment. Patients enrolled into the trial will be treated and followed until death or lost to follow-up. Additional information on the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) will be collected.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
DRUG: Investigator´s choice of chemotherapy|DRUG: BIBW 2992
Progression Free Survival (Part B), Progression free survival (PFS) time as determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), Version 1.1 from day of randomization until disease progression or death for patients randomised to combination therapy with afatinib plus paclitaxel or to investigator's choice of chemotherapy.

Median was calculated from the Kaplan-Meier curve., From randomization until disease progression or death; Up to 32 months
Progression Free Survival (Part A), Progression free survival (PFS) as determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) 1.1 for Part A.

Median was calculated from the Kaplan-Meier curve., From first dose administration until disease progression or death; Up to 51 months|Overall Survival (Part B), Overall survival (OS) as determined by the time from randomization to death in part B.

Median was calculated from the Kaplan-Meier curve., From randomization until death; Up to 32 months|Objective Response (Part A), Objective response defined as the best overall response of complete response \[CR\]: disappearance of all target lesion \& partial response \[PR\]: ≥30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions , taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter of Afatinib monotherapy according to RECIST 1.1 for Part A., Post baseline tumour-imaging was performed at every 6 weeks thereafter until disease progression; upto 51 months|Objective Response (Part B), Objective response (CR, PR) of Afatinib/paclitaxel combination therapy and comparator chemotherapy in Part B after progression in Part A according to RECIST 1.1 ., Post baseline tumour-imaging was performed at every 8 weeks thereafter until disease progression; up to 32 Months|Intensity and Incidence of Adverse Events (AEs) for Part A & Part B., Safety of Afatinib as indicated by intensity and incidence of adverse events, graded according to United States National Cancer Institute Common terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (US NCI CTCAE) Version 3.0 both for Part A and Part B. The CTCAE grades are: 1 (mild AE), 2 (moderate AE), 3 (severe AE), 4 (life-threatening or disabling AE), 5 (death related to AE)., From first administration of treatment until 28 days after last drug administration, up to 51 Months (Part A) and from randomization until 28 days after last drug administration of Trial medication, up to 32 Months (Part B)
