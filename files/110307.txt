GINECO-EN102b - BKM120 as Monotherapy in the Treatment of Initial or Recurrent Metastatic Endometrial Cancer
This study is to determine the clinical efficacy of BKM120 as monotherapy in the treatment of initial or recurrent metastatic endometrial cancer after first line radio chemotherapy.

Clinical efficacy will be determined by the non-progression rate at 3 or 2 months depending on the group of patients. The primary endpoint is the non-progression rate at 3 months (12 weeks) for the patient group whose disease is painless (low grade tumor = stratum 1) and the non-progression rate at 2 months (8 weeks) for the group of patients with an aggressive disease (high grade tumor = stratum 2).

Disease progression is defined by the RECIST 1.1 criteria
Endometrial Cancer
DRUG: BKM120
Clinical Efficacy, To determine the clinical efficacy of BKM120 as monotherapy in the treatment of initial or recurrent metastatic endometrial cancer after first line radio chemotherapy., 3 months
Safety according to CTCAE v4.0 criteria and mood questionnaires : PHQ-9 and GAD-7, To assess patient safety and the tolerance of BKM120 administered as monotherapy at the daily dose of 100 mg., Patient will be followed for the duration of the study, an expected average of 75 days|Efficacy: PFS, To evaluate progression-free survival, 6 months|Efficacy: ORR, To evaluate the objective response rate according to RECIST 1.1, Patient will be followed for the duration of the study, an expected average of 75 days|Efficacy: overall survival, To evaluate overall survival., Patients will be followed for an expected average of 1 year and 75 days|Efficacy: duration of response, To evaluate the duration of the response. For patients in complete remission, the duration of the response will be calculated from the day on which a complete response is determined for the first time up to progression.

For patients in partial remission, the duration of the response will be the overall response period calculated from the administration of the first treatment cycle up to the date of progression., Patients will be followed for an expected average of 1 year and 75 days
