Treatment of Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Cancer After Gemcitabine Failure.
In Brazil pancreatic adenocarcinoma represents 2% of tumors, and 4% mortality being an uncommon disease, however very aggressive.Only 20% of cases are indicated for curative surgery, of which only 20% are alive within 5 years. For locally, advanced or metastatic disease, since 1997, single chemotherapy with gemcitabine is the standard treatment for first line, with survival around 6 months approximately.There is no standard treatment regimen for second-line, however Paclitaxel demonstrated effect on second-line phase II study. Metformin is an oral hypoglycemic drug used for treatment of diabetes mellitus. There is a growing number of preclinical studies which show antitumor effect against pancreatic adenocarcinoma, probably due to the effect of anti-insulin growth factor (IGF-1). This study will add metformin to standard treatment for second line of locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma in ICESP previously treated with gemcitabine. The objective is to evaluate whether metformin improves the efficacy of the standard treatment with paclitaxel by clinical and radiological evaluation.
Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Advanced or Metastatic
DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Metformin
Radiologic control of disease, The radiologic image will be analyzed by RECIST 1.0 criteria., Every 8 weeks from the date of first dose of treatment until disease progression.
Time to progression., Thorax and abdominal computerized tomography and Ca 19.9 tumor marker dosage every 8 weeks until disease progression., Every 8 weeks from the date of first dose of treatment until disease progression.|To estimate the biochemical response through the measurement of serum CA19.9 levels., From the date of first dose of treatment until disease progression.|To evaluate the clinical benefits, Will be evaluate:

* ECOG
* Treatment with opioids
* Pain
* Weight, Every 4 weeks during the treatment period until disease progression.
