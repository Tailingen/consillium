A Multicenter Study of RUS NE
This sponsor-initiated, randomized controlled clinical trial aims to demonstrate the clinical efficacy of RUS NE Surgical Navigation System in patients undergoing robotic-assisted partial nephrectomy. The trial will compare the experimental group (n=102) using RUS NE with a control group (n=102), aiming to show an 10% reduction in operation time. The study will involve 6 medical centers in South Korea in patient recruitment and evaluate the clinical efficacy and feasibility of the software, which has been shown to be reliable in previous studies.

* Investigational Medical Device: RUS NE (Endoscopic Imaging Treatment Planning Software)
* Clinical Trial duration: 24 months from IRB approval -Target number of subjects: Total of 204 participants
Renal Tumors
DEVICE: RUS NE
Operative time, The duration of time between starting a surgical incision to the last sutures of the operation., The operative day (operative day ± 5 days)
Tumor and vessel identification time, The duration of time between starting manipulation of the surgeon console to the finishing dissection of the hilum and perinephric fat, The operative day (operative day ± 5 days)|Resection volume, Calculated from the 3-dimensional lengths from the resected renal specimen using ellipsoid formula (π/6XYZ), From the postoperative 1week to the postoperative 5 weeks|Postoperative complications, Incidence of postoperative complications occurred within 4 weeks after the operation. The complications include urine leak, acute kidney injury, renal hemorrhage, fluid collection, abscess, and pulmonary or cardiac complications., From the postoperative 8 weeks to the postoperative 16 weeks
After selecting subjects and obtaining informed consent, randomization will be conducted. Robot-assisted partial nephrectomy will be performed using RUS NE or without using software. Parameters-associated with operation or clinical outcomes will be evaluated during hospitalization period or through outpatient follow-ups for up to 3 months after discharge.
