Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping With Different Injection Sites of ICG in Endometrium Cancer
The primary goal of this prospective study is to define the efficacy of the sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) procedure by comparing different method performed in patients with endometrial cancer. The aim of this study is to investigate whether the detection rate of sentinel lymph node (SLN) with two different injection sites may be increased compared to the standard use with single site (cervix) injection in endometrial cancer.

The primary treatment for endometrial cancer involves total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, with adjuvant radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy reserved for patients with advanced disease or who have risk factors for relapse. The tumor is confined to the uterus in 85% of endometrial cancers. Hence, it's controversial to perform systematic lymphadenectomy to all patients. The primary purpose of the present study is the to investigate the feasibility of sentinel lymph node determination in endometrial cancer patients operated via conventional laparoscopy. To determine sentinel lymph nodes cervical indocyanine green will be injected prior to the surgery. During the surgery using fluorescent imaging systems sentinel lymph nodes will be removed and examined by frozen section. Afterwards, systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy will be performed if sentinel lymph node is positive.
