Multiple Myeloma Minimal Residual Disease
Three methods including flow cytometry, next generation sequencing and determination of circulating tumor cells will be performed at different time points in patients with previously undiagnosed multiple myeloma in order to determine the most sensitive method to detect residual disease
Multiple Myeloma
BIOLOGICAL: blood samples and bone marrow aspirates will be collected
Quantification of residual disease, study the sensitivity of the method of quantification of circulating tumor cells compared to 2 others methods of detection, Residual disease is assessed up to 18 months after inclusion
kinetic of variation of the residual tumor cells detected by flow cytometry method, % positive cells in bone marrow sample, 18 months|kinetic of variation of the residual tumor cells detected by new generation sequencing method, % positive in bone marrow sample, 18 months|kinetic of variation of the circulating tumor cells, number of cells / mL of blood, 18 months
