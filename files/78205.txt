It is a short 16-item patient-completed assessment that are classified into three domains: symptoms \[four items, 1-4\], emotions, \[seven items, 5-11\] and functioning \[five items, 12-16\]. All items are scored on a seven-point numerical analogue scales (0=never bothered to 6=always bothered). Each item is then transformed to a linear scale from 0 (never bothered) to 100 (always bothered), where higher the score = more severe in impairment. The total score is the average of all 16 items scores ranging from 0 \[best Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL)\] to 96 (worst HRQoL), where higher score indicates worst quality of life., Baseline, Day 57|Change from Baseline in Skindex-16 Questionnaire Overall Score and Domain Scores (Symptoms, Emotions, and Functioning) at Day 113 in Participants who Receive 2 Treatment Courses, Skindex-16 is used for participants to rate skin conditions that have occurred within the previous week.
