Colorectal Cancer Screening Navigator Program for Low Income and Non-English Speaking Populations
The goal of this study is to implement and in a controlled randomised trial test a program to identify and overcome barriers to CRC screening and thus improve CRC screening rates at MGH Chelsea HC.

Our hypothesis is that a bilingual navigator program, enhanced by using trained interpreting staff will improve CRC screening rates at MGH Chelsea HC overall, and decrease disparities between patients with limited English proficiency and English speakers
Colorectal Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Patient Navigation
Percentage of Eligible Patients In Study and Control Groups Who Undergo CRC Screening, 18 Months
Type of CRC Screening Test Performed in Study vs Control Groups, 18 Months|Number of Polyps and Cancers per 100 Patients in the Study vs Control Group, 18 Months
We developed a training program for five health center interpreters fluent in eight different languages. Patients randomly assigned to the study intervention receive an introductory letter in their native language. During the initial contact the navigator educates patients about CRC screening and explores patients' barriers to CRC screening. Based on results from a qualitative study conducted at in 2006, we developed interventions to overcome individual barriers to CRC screening tailored to each individual patient. Specific interventions include elucidation of culturally-specific health beliefs; teaching about cancer risk, colonoscopy, and colon prep administration; and help with appointment-making and transport.
