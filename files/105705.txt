Impact of Adjuvant Hormone Therapy on Bone and Cardiovascular Risk
Breast cancer is the most frequently observed cancer in women in France.The mortality rate is still decreasing with a decrease of 1.6% per year between 2010 and 2018, explained by the improvement in available treatments.For patients with breast cancer expressing hormone receptors, treatment with Tamoxifen or anti-aromatase can have the risk of the cancer coming back.However, these treatments have many side effects, including the risk of osteoporosis and metabolic disorders with anti-aromatases; and arterial and thromboembolic accidents with Tamoxifen.These effects have been well studied while taking hormone therapy.However, very few studies have analyzed the impact of these treatments after stopping them in women who have had non-metastatic hormone-sensitive breast cancer and uncertainties persist on the evolution of the health risk after initial treatment.
