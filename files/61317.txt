The Effectiveness of Augmented Reality Facilitated Education in Promoting Care Management of Malignant Fungating Wounds Among Oncology Nurses
Malignant fungating wounds (MFWs) affect 5-14% of patients with advanced cancer, making them a common complication in this population. Characterized by symptoms such as foul odor, heavy exudate, bleeding, moderate to severe pain, and infection, MFWs cause significant physical discomfort and pose life-threatening risks while also leading to profound psychosocial issues, including shame and social isolation. These factors severely impact patients' quality of life, with half of those diagnosed surviving only six months on average.

However, clinical nursing staff often lack adequate knowledge and skills in managing MFWs, with an average accuracy rate of just 56.5%. Notable deficiencies exist in areas such as wound disinfection, odor control, and wound assessment, directly affecting the quality of patient care and highlighting an urgent need for specialized MFW training. Traditional MFW education often lacks real-life clinical scenarios and hands-on practice, resulting in a gap between learning and application and leaving learners ill-prepared for the complexities of clinical settings.

In contrast, augmented reality (AR) technology presents new possibilities for nursing education. AR can create highly simulated clinical environments where learners can safely practice complex clinical skills, enhancing clinical decision-making abilities. The implementation of AR-based training programs provides nursing staff with a more realistic and effective learning experience, allowing them to better address the challenges posed by MFWs and ultimately contributing to improvements in patient care and quality of life.

MFWs care Knowledge scale, 1. \*\*MFWs Care Knowledge Scale\*\* This study will assess MFWs care knowledge using the \*\*MFWs Care Knowledge Scale\*\*.

The scale ranges from \*\*0 to 100\*\*, with higher scores indicating \*\*better\*\* knowledge levels.

The assessment will be conducted at \*\*baseline and post-intervention\*\* to measure changes in MFWs care knowledge over time., 6months
Clinical Reasoning Scale, This study will assess clinical reasoning ability using the Clinical Reasoning Scale. The scale ranges from 16 to 80, with higher scores representing better clinical reasoning ability. Measurements will be taken before and after the intervention to assess changes in clinical reasoning performance., 6months
