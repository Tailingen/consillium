Tertiary Lymphoid Structures in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
This study aims to conduct a prospective cohort study to validate the prognostic performance of Tertiary Lymphoid Structures (TLSs) as a predictive marker in pathological tissue sections for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The TLS assessment framework established in this research has the potential to serve as a reference for personalized treatment strategies in NPC patients.
Nasopharyngeal Cancinoma (NPC)
Disease-free Survival, DFS is defined as the time from the date of enrollment to the first occurrence of either disease progression (as confirmed by imaging or clinical evaluation) or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. For patients without these events, DFS is censored at the time of the last follow-up., 3 Years
Overall Survival, OS is defined as the time from the date of enrollment to death from any cause, or the time interval to the last follow-up for patients who are alive at the end of the study., 3 Years|Locoregional Recurrenc-free Survival, LRRFS is defined as the time from the date of enrollment to the first occurrence of locoregional relapse (confirmed by imaging or clinical evaluation), or the time interval to the last follow-up for patients without locoregional relapse., 3 Years|Distant Metastasis-Free Survival, DMFS is defined as the time from the date of enrollment to the first occurrence of distant metastasis (confirmed by imaging or clinical evaluation), or the time interval to the last follow-up for patients without distant metastasis., 3 Years
