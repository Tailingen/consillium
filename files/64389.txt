Safety Study of a Genetically Modified Adenovirus in Ovarian Cancer Patients
The primary purpose of this study is to determine the maximally tolerated dose and spectrum of toxicities encountered with intraperitoneal delivery of a RGD modified conditionally replicative adenovirus (Ad5-Delta 24RGD) in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer.

Secondary objectives :

* To determine the biologic effects encountered with intraperitoneal delivery of Ad5-Delta 24RGD in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer cells
* To determine immunologic response generated against Ad5-Delta 24RGD when administered intraperitoneally to patients with recurrent ovarian adenocarcinoma
* To determine potential clinical activity of Ad5-Delta 24RGD when administered intraperitoneally to patients with recurrent ovarian adenocarcinoma
