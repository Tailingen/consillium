Serum Metabolomics Study of Traditional Chinese Medicine Formula （Shen Qi Tiao Ti Formula） Intervention to Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a most common, heterogeneous, complex endocrinopathy disease.Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been used in the treatment of PCOS for many years. However, the mechanism underlying TCM remains obscure and challenging.In the present study, a metabolomics approach based on ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled with linear ion trap Orbi-trap mass spectrometer (LTQ Orbi-trap MS) is used to investigate serum metabolic changes of TCM intervention to PCOS.
