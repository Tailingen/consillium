Estimating Lymphocyte Counts from DNA Methylation
The goal of this observational study is to assess lymphocyte levels in colorectal cancer patients using DNA methylation levels in tissues or blood. The main questions it aims to answer are:

Can DNA methylation features calculate lymphocyte levels? Can the calculated lymphocyte levels assess the efficacy and prognosis of immunotherapy?
