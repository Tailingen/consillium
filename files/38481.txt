Value of the Laparoscopic Approach in the Surgical Management of Resectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Hepatocellular carcinoma treated by laparotomy or laparoscopic Multicenter prospective, open, superiority, controlled, randomized, clinical trial The primary objective of the study will be to demonstrate the superiority of the laparoscopic approach over the open approach in reducing postoperative morbidity in HCC patients.

Postoperative morbidity will be assessed using the Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI) within 90 days postoperatively or at any time during hospitalization
